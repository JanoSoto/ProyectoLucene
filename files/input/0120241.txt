Former gangster Carlo Bartolucci aka Charlie Barrett (Christopher Walken in one of his best roles ever) attends a bistro where he finds that a group of swaggering young men, consisting of Max (Sean Patrick Flanery), Avery (Henry Thomas), Brett (Jay Mohr), T.K. (Jeremy Sisto), and Ira (Johnny Galecki), have taken over his usual booth. Charmed by the guys, Charlie takes them for a ride, only for them to knock him out with some chloroform while going down the Queens tunnel in a hilarious sequence. Charlie regains consciousness inside of Ira's mansion taped to a chair with one of his fingers missing, having been cut off to compensate for Avery's kidnapped sister's missing limb. The guys keep Charlie prisoner in the mansion, but soon, Charlie starts to play head games with them, and it soon becomes obvious that there is a traitor in their midst.This darkly humorous crime thriller can be described in the most simple terms as The Breakfast Club meets The Godfather or something like that, even though I myself never saw The Godfather. Walken is increasingly laughter-provoking, suave, and creepy all at the same time as he delivers witticism after witticism despite his usual situation. Four of the lead males (Henry Thomas, Jay Mohr, Sean Patrick Flanery, and Jeremy Sisto) all portray swaggering rich boys, while Johnny Galecki (David from TV's Roseanne) is screamingly funny as the nitpicking nerd of the bunch and Denis Leary is his usual laid-back self as slick and wisecracking gangster Lono (what a funny name!).I said it once and I'll say it again -- Suicide Kings is a darkly comical film, but it is highly recommended (for those with kids) that you watch this either late at night or while the kids are away.I give Suicide Kings a 10 out of 10 on a scale of 1-10 in my humble opinion.

I compare it with movies like Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects,  U-Turn,  Kalifornia,  Wild Things,  True Romance and A Simple Plan.  Like all of the above,  SK was violent,  bloody and full of surprising twists.  To add to its shadowy charm,  it had a psychotic sense of humor.  But the most amazing thing about this movie is Christopher Walken's subtly venomous performance,  which complements the sharp, individualized performances of the younger cast members.  Walken plays Charlie Barrett,  a man who is unwittingly recruited to help five college-aged rich kids rescue one of their sisters,  who has been kidnapped for a $2 million ransom.  The five kids  nervous Avery (Henry Thomas),  the one whose sis Elise (Laura Harris) is endangered;  handsome Max (Sean Patrick Flanery),  who is Elise's sweetheart;  Brett (Jay Mohr),  the one with a hell of an anger problem;  aspiring doctor TK (Jeremy Sisto);  and ultra-neurotic Ira (Johnny Galecki) whose house becomes a hideout for the kids after they kidnap Barrett.  Brett concocts the plan.  Max drugs him, TK severs one of his digits,  and Charlie is duct-taped to a fancy office chair,  hooked up to an IV which is pumping more drugs into him.  Meantime, Avery broods nervously over his missing sis and Ira squeals endlessly about the blood TK is getting all over the nice varnished floor.  While the boys bicker at each other about how to continue their insanely flawed caper, Barrett regards this group of inexperienced whipper-snappers with a myriad mix of sympathy,  amusement and anger.  But anger from a man like Charlie Barrett is not to be taken lightly,  it is to be feared.  Charlie is a man who with one spoken word,  could have these five kids murdered and their bodies hidden where no one will ever find them.  You know that from the minute you meet him,  but the scariest thing about Charlie is his quiet mannerism.  This serpent is indeed subtil.  He does not shout,  he gently whispers hints of warning to the kids that they've made a bad mistake messing with him.  He taps into these kids early on,  uncovering their dirty little family secrets and their own individual not-so-secret addictions,  to drink,  to drugs,  to gambling.   And he uses devices, honed from years of experience in a world these kids know nothing about, to his advantage.  He may be physically incapacitated,  he may be outnumbered,  but he knows the kids are still no match for him.  There's no arrogance in this knowledge, and it is truly creepy.  It's a battle of wits that kept me on the edge of my seat,  gave me the most delicious shivers of perverse anticipation,  and it was honestly very hard to know which side to route for.  I really love this movie.  See it if you haven't.   )~  "},{"Title":"Kidnap Yarn Done Very Well","Date":"30 June 1999","Score":"29 out of 36 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Kidnap films have been made for decades. (Check out Ransom for a typical example.) In a way Suicide Kings starts out like a low budget B movie of the 40's and 50's. The beginning is obvious and a bit overly dramatic. But this is when Suicide Kings began to surprise me.Christopher Walken in an amazing performance shows that an actor can be the center of a film while sitting down for almost an hour. Also, this movie pulls no punches in showing organized crime/mob violence. Yet, the vigilante college kidnapers are shown in such a harsh manner that after a while you begin to root for the mobsters over the ivy league losers. It's an amazing turn around.On top of this there is some wicked humor in the film not unlike Goodfellas. Denis Leary as he was in the Ref is great as the abusive and befuddled thug.What was very satisfying was that the ending was just right. Finally a movie that does not have a ridiculous happy ending tacked on to it. Suicide Kings is brutal in its logic but the story makes sense from start to finish. Despite its low budget and its routine beginning, this is a very good film.

He combines psychotic reasoning with deliberate hostility, you the movie viewer may take your pick as to what you prefer!! Either way, he is sensational in every movie he stars in !!! Denis Leary (The former Cop) always seems to make his point very clearly with a gun and/or a lethal object!! Jay Mohr has a flippant demeanor towards his roles no matter how serious these roles are!! This acting mode of his makes him very effective!! He is wonderful at engaging in degrading condescension and intellectual obviation of anyone he perceives as his adversary!!!Anything that has to be accomplished in a role, Jay Mohr seems to carry it off and flawlessly!! The list of all other actors in this movie merely epitomizes the superb acting talent in Suicide Kings..Very few films exude such acting ability!!The movie starts out with an amateurishly orchestrated kidnapping attempt which is used as a defense strategy to abort another kidnapping!! It is a proverbial case of the adolescent's version of an eye for an eye!! This convoluted logic serves as a dementedly lingering discontentment for a bunch of educated pipsqueaks!! The bottom line on this whole charade is that there is little or no organization for the expedition of this particular kidnapping!! Mutilation of Christopher Walken's finger serve as a cry for attention!! It really does not work, of course, this is the movies, not real life!! The intensity of emotions in this film makes everything cohesive in terms of what depraved mixes of irrationality prevail in these affluent derelict's lives!!I thought the acting was fantastic in this film, and it was a simple plot outline of age and experience winning out over precocious recreation with criminal chicanery!! Everything was an argument..there were more issues out there besides a kidnapping!!! Criminal doubts and insecurities are always depicted in movies like these, just not so succinctly!! This movie illustrates how ideological disagreement with a prevailing situation does not sufficiently justify engaging in a felony!! I thought this film was excellent!!!

However the longer they keep Bartolucci the closer his right hand man Veccio gets to finding them and the more the friends realise that the kidnapping plot may be more complex than first thought.Attracted to this film by the presence of Walken playing the role he does best &#150; some sort of mobster &#150; I wasn't really sure what to expect.  The overly stylised opening credits and the initially confusing mix of flashbacks within flashbacks to set the story were quite distracting however soon settled down into a more straightforward plot.  This plot holds the interest due to the confined situation in which most of the action occurs and is quite involving.  The first few twists are well handled but it starts to put the film into a spin from which it doesn't recover, as more twists mount up and become increasingly alienating and contrived.  At the end I didn't feel any involvement or surprise by the twists whereas I had sat up and paid attention to the first few.The film is quite comic at places and this makes it feel like a more enjoyable piece than it would have if it had just been played straight.  However this comic touch doesn't take away from the fact that the film is really a thriller of sorts.  The cast is roundly good, without anyone of the main group really stealing the show.  Walken does his role in his sleep but is still effective &#150; his transformation as he gains confidence during the film is well put across.  The young group of actors playing the friends are all pretty good although the `where have I seen him before factor' was a little distracting (6 Feet Under, Roseanne etc).  However it is the (wisely expanded) character played by Leary that really is the one that I kept looking forward to seeing.  His character almost feels like he is in a movie of his own which is a distraction, but means his scenes are all very enjoyable.  His dialogue is knowingly cool and his character is comically overblown to good effect.  The film truly benefits from having him in the role.Overall this film wants to be cooler and better than it really is, the end result of which is a spiral of twists which become increasingly uncontrolled and uninvolving.  It is enjoyable enough to watch and the use of one main set helps to add to the tension of the story, however once the twists come they don't stop which sadly leads to them becoming increasingly less effective.  Worth a watch but subject to the law of diminishing returns in terms of plotting.

This film isn't great, but it is better than `Dogs.'  Tarantino's innovation was to add a more self-aware cinematic quotation of prior films. The humor over violence is just an instance of that new distance with the viewer. Seemed novel at the time, but since so many people are doing this better, now it seems rather trivial.`Kings' is a very simple thing, done well. The ensemble works. The camerawork and editing isn't very adventuresome, but does do some impressive continuous shots.

Two million dollars in ransom is demanded. Her finger arrives in the mail. (I think this is what happens anyway. I missed a few critical minutes at the beginning.) The frat boy organizes a handful of his upper-middle-class friends and they manage to kidnap a notorious capo, Christopher Walken, who is either behind the kidnapping or knows who is, and so will help them retrieve the rest of her body, minus the finger. They chloroform him and take him to an empty mansion on Long Island where, to convince him they are hard-hearted and determined, instead of the inexperienced nudniks they are, they remove his finger while he's unconscious.Walken wakes up in this large house belonging to one of the preppies and the rest of the film is taken up with his trying to get the girl back from the wheelchair he is duct-taped into.Doesn't sound too promising. It's mostly shot on one set, like a filmed play. But three things lift this effort above the level I'd expected.One is the working out of the plot, which has several unexpected pirouettes. The kidnapping is pegged by the mob almost immediately as an inside job, which is about as far as attorney-client privilege will allow me to go.The second is the dialog, which has innumerable sparkles in it -- and that's critical because it's a talky movie. Some lines are very amusing. Some are dead serious. Here's one of the funnier ones. Walken is taped into his chair and has to pee. So how will it be managed? Do they free his hands, something they're understandable loathe to do, or does somebody unzip Walken and make sure he evacuates his bladder in a tidy manner? (Aim him good!, cries the chubby little kid whose parents own the mansion.) While this mission is being discussed, Walken contributes his point of view. If somebody is going to be holding hands with my ****, can I at least get a drink first? I'm not asking for dinner and dancing. I'm not asking for a commitment. The third is the acting. Man, do these guys put it across. Especially notable are Dennis Leary as Walken's chief agent, and Walken himself. Neither steps wrong. Christopher Walken is a marvelous actor. He's confined to a chair. He's bled half to death. He's strung out behind some analgesics and booze. And his set expression is one that artfully blends boredom with mild interest in the proceedings. At times he speaks like the soul of reason amidst these adolescent collisions of will. The director, Peter O'Fallon, gives us multiple reaction shots of Walker placidly watching the arguments and barbs being thrown back and forth by his captors, and they're funny as hell.But don't be misled. It's not ALL talk. There's action too for the aficionados. Several shootings take place and while none of them results in a bath tub full of gore and splattered brains, none is done for laughs either.It's well written, nicely directed, and the cast is fine.

Jeremy Sisto is a favorite of mine, so I caught it for that very reason. I watched this awhile ago, so my memories may not be all that fresh. It was a dark comedy that had you guessing till the end. The ending was great by the way. You would've never guessed where the movie was going. Christopher Walken was awesome as usual. The plot seemed silly, but it was still worthy of a good watch. Some very good up and coming actors (of the time) made an appearance in this film. The performances were honest and gripping. One was driven by a need to protect his sister and his friends, who would do anything for him, helped to kidnap a powerful man in order to turn the tables. Another was driven by protecting his girlfriend. Nothing was really forced or unbelievable within their acting. Even though Walken seems to do these types of mafia parts often, it's only cuz he's good at it. Even though he's kidnapped, he's trying to talk some sense into these kids. That was humorous at best. Not only that, he studies his captors to find out their weaknesses and who could actually be involved in the kidnapping, thus lying to his friends. Sisto's character was a little underdeveloped for me. *SPOILER* You find out he abuses morphine to combat the pressures of being a doctor, but it's like a blip in the celluloid. Nothing after that. It seems fairly irrelevant and not worth the 30 seconds it took to reveal. The whole movie is good and teases you until the ending, which as I said before it wow. I could watch this movie over and over and you see the hidden clues it had from the get-go. Very intelligent movie. Oh, and I must comment on Dennis Leary's role. What a riot! He was great and delightfully amusing as he tries to get his boss (Walken) back. His cynicism and sailor's mouth were a nice retreat from the gravity of the film. Yet, the delving into his character's dual nature (his nice side) was poignant as well. It didn't make him one-dimensional and allowed you to like him more as a person than a comic relief.

Nevertheless, it's a fun ride all the way through.  The characters are all interesting, in their own way.  People have referred to the Ira character as annoying and obnoxious, but he's also the character I most relate to.  You'll never catch me throwing a party in my house when my parents are gone, because I'm incredibly paranoid about people wrecking the place and I can imagine how paranoid I'd be in Ira's situation with his friends keeping a gangster with his finger cut off captive in my parents' living room.  The actors all do splendid jobs, and have a natural chemistry.  As for Christopher Walken, when does he not please?  He's one of the most intense, engaging, brilliant actors of all time and that's that!  Once Walken's on screen, the dynamic completely changes for the better, whether it be a movie of this quality or one of the Prophecy sequels.  Denis Leary is hilarious as Walken's right hand man whose running gag is the fact that he wears boots made from stingrays.  People keep referring to them as fish boots.  He plays the same irritable, pugnacious, f-word-spewing character as in 90 percent of his work, but who cares?  Some actors are so good at playing one character that they get away with it no matter how many times it's reprised.  Leary is one of those actors.  His talents mainly lie in stand-up comedy, so his range isn't that broad.  But Leary's good at playing Leary, or an extension of himself, and I'd much rather see him in that role than as, say, a sensitive romantic lead.  I loved watching him beat the guy up with a toaster and the other one with a golf club.  I love to see Leary do stuff like that.  Jay Mohr, a fellow stand-up comedian, is also good mainly at playing that particular role and that's what he does in this movie.  Not a big stretch for him either, but it's what he's good at.  It was also cool to see Everybody Loves Raymond's Brad Garrett in a more serious role, and using language he can't use on TV.  The whole film is basically filled with 4-letter words, but it fits the testosterone-filled tone, being that the cast is predominantly male.  There is as much excitement as there is dark humor.  Director Peter O'Fallon balances those elements nicely.  And I loved the theme song over the credit sequence.  For some reason, it's still pounding in my head.

So much so that it makes me wish it made for a better film.Suicide Kings tries to be a psychological thriller focusing on mental cat-and-mouse games between the mobsters and his kidnappers, and the actors are good enough to pull it off - in fact, they're good enough to make you think that there's any psychological depth to the film, when really there's none. Walken and the talented young cast - Denis Leary, Jay Mohr, Sean Patrick Flanery (The Boondock Saints), Jeremy Sisto (Law & Order), Johnny Galecki (The Big Bang Theory) and Henry Thomas (E.T's Elliot all grown up) - all deliver their lines with so much passion and conviction that you almost don't notice how messy and shallow the script really is.This fine group of actors - and Walken's wildly charismatic performance most of all, from an actor so powerful he can dominate the film while being tied to a chair for all but a few minutes of it - is more than enough to make the film entertaining, even very enjoyable. The weak script, which deteriorates into cheap twists and conspiracies towards the end - makes it entirely forgettable. A quick comparison to Danny Boyle's Shallow Grave is a testament to how much more comfortable the British are with theatrical minimalism. With a great director and a great script, Suicide Kings could have been something wonderful. As it is, it's good enough for one pleasurable watch, but leaves no mark and no impression.

The King of Diamonds is called the Suicide King because while all the other face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) appear to be holding scepters, globes, etc, the King Of Diamond is holding a sword, and on close examination, he appears to be sticking it in his own ear. FYI.Anyway, this is the kind of little gem you hope for when you go out to see a crime thriller - strong performances, a quirky plot centering around a battle of wits, effective dialog which not only rings true to the ear (with two exceptions, see below), but also successfully mixes menace, humor, and pathos in equal measure. While this is definitely not family fare, and while I can't imagine the Oprah crowd ever enjoying a movie like Suicide Kings, anyone with a taste for suspense, noir or thriller material will find much to enjoy here.The scenario is brilliantly conceived five callow preppie college kids kidnap a semi-retired crime boss. They hope to force his cooperation in rescuing a second kidnap victim (a young woman who is the sister of one of the boys and the lover of another member of the group. Because Walken's character has been semi-legit for many years, the boys get lucky and catch him off guard. Walken's character (Charlie) wakes up duct taped to a chair, with one finger already chopped off (to impress on him the urgency of their situation) and pumped full of pain killers.However, the movie soon makes it clear that the boys have caught a tiger by the tail. Even taped to a chair and physically helpless,Charlie is far tougher, shrewder, and more ruthless than all of his captors put together. Even while slowly bleeding to death, he manages to use his contacts to get the hunt for the young woman under way and turn the members of the group against each other with carefully chosen observations and revelations. The process is fascinating to behold - Charlie can be witty, patronizing, menacing and comforting all in the space of 60 seconds, and you literally fear for these young mens' lives and futures even though they seem to have the upper hand. They aren't street sharks and killers, and Charlie is.Also impressive is Denis Leary, who plays Charlie's chief strong arm and factotum, Lono. Leary's rants and ravings are long, involved, quirky, funny, and highly entertaining. There is a running joke involving Lono's new stingray skin boots that is almost worth the price of admission by itself. Although I never believed Leary's dangerous tough guy image in the movies (he would have gotten his butt kicked at my junior high school), I give him credit. He fairly boils over with restless, angry energy as an actor. This makes his character Lono is a lot of fun to watch. Lono is the kind of guy who gripes about the new graphite shafts of the golf clubs he uses to beat the stuffings out of people, and how much better the old metal shafts were for the task.The movie isn't perfect. The weakest character of the group of kidnappers, Ira is written and played so broadly that at times he is quite annoying. It's obvious he is supposed to be the comic relief of the group, and the actor works hard to invest a thankless character with some depth and humanity. And if this were a pure caper film,I think the character and the performance would have been fine. But Ira is such a whiny schmuck that he saps the movie of some of the energy it has at times. Other people may disagree with me on this one, and I'm not saying he's bad, I'm just saying that he takes things a little too far for this kind of movie.The other weak point is the second pair of kidnappers, Heckle and Jeckyl. The two character actors who play them (including Brad Garrett, most recently known for his part in Everybody Loves Raymond) are obviously old hands at this sort of character, but in the scenes set in their apartment (where they are supposedly holding the girl), they come off as buffoons, sort of like Laurel and Hardy with snub nosed 38s. While they are quite entertaining, it's impossible to take them seriously, and this also detracts from the sense of menace and urgency that is supposed to be driving the situation.Anyway, aside from those minor caveats, I was really, really impressed by this movie. Anyone with a taste for darkly humored, quirky noir films such as Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects will find this a worthy entry in the genre, as long as they can overlook those two sub-par aspects.PS The DVD reissue of Suicide Kings contains two alternate endings which film completists and fanatics will enjoy. The first alternate ending is somewhat sappy and romantic, and doesn't really jibe with the tone of the previous 15 minutes. The second ending is more workable, and has a nice twist. IMO, I think that the grimmer ending they kept was ultimately the most satisfying way to end the film. You may disagree.

Sometimes you just have to watch a movie without overanalysing it and just enjoy the ride. I guess one of the things you could get hung up on is the fact that the whole set-up for the movie depends on the fact whether a mob-boss chooses to get in a car with a gang of youngsters he's never seen before to join for dinner with one of their fathers. A bit hard to swallow I'll admit. But hey, if you accept that someone could acquire superpowers by getting bitten by a radioactive spider this is a small leap of faith. Anyway, there are more of these strange irregularities in the script but I'll take a few strange coincidences for the sake of a good movie. What I'm having a harder time dealing with is the strange tone. It's like the director couldn't make up his mind whether to make it a dark comedy or a thriller/gangster film. Now it just sort of stumbles in between. A shame really, because it is a great set up with a rather unusual hostage situation where the hostage gradually takes control of and turns the tables on his kidnappers. In the right hands this could have been a fantastic movie instead of just a good one.6/10 "},{"Title":"Ridiculously unbelievable","Date":"25 February 2003","Score":"8 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Perhaps if this movie had been better structured I might for one minute have bought its premise, but as it was I found the whole thing laughable.

I've never been a fan of Quentin Tarantino, but this film made me admit that he at least has a sense of pacing and timing. Suicide Kings injects bits of Tarantinoesque humor in the most inappropriate places, and goes off into meaningless tangents that never add anything to the storyline. It also tried to make suspenseful moments out of nothing, merely by throwing in some anxious music. Some of the acting is okay, e.g., Denis Leary's performance as a Mafia thug, but mostly the actors are powerless to make anything out of the foolish script. Christopher Walken is the most grounded person in the movie--and that's a scary thought.

That's the artistic quality of a painting, right?

Such is the case with Suicide Kings. Largely overlooked upon its initial release and by now all but forgotten this is a movie which deserved to be seen by a much wider audience. It's highly entertaining with a great balance of dramatic tension and humor. The story has enough twists in it to keep you guessing right up until the end.Christopher Walken plays the central role of businessman Charlie Barret around whom everything in our story revolves. Why is that character's name in quotes? Because while he's now gone legit once upon a time Charlie was mob kingpin Carlo Bartolucci. While he may be a little out of practice there is no doubt that Charlie is still a man to be feared. Which makes kidnapping him and cutting off one of his fingers a rather bad idea. But that is what a group of young men do, ostensibly because one of them has a sister who has just been kidnapped and her finger was cut off and...well, it's complicated. They think Charlie can use his old connections to find the girl and get the ransom money. Surely there had to be a better way to go about this than tying a mob boss to a chair and cutting off his appendages but that's their plan and they're sticking to it. But it doesn't take long for things to begin to unravel. And that's where the movie's fun truly begins.Walken is a delight and surely the best thing the film has to offer although Denis Leary runs him close with his profane, explosive performance as Charlie's bodyguard Lono Veccio. None of the actors playing the kidnapping masterminds really stands out but they work well together. And that is important as Charlie starts playing off these close friends against one another. Charlie's no dummy, he realizes very quickly that this whole sister being kidnapped story has holes in it large enough to drive a truck through. What's really going on here? Charlie pokes and prods and breeds distrust. He has his kidnappers questioning everything, most especially each other. Charlie's tied to a chair, down to nine fingers, slowly bleeding to death but somehow he's got the upper hand. Walken is spot-on perfect and his performance really elevates the film. And the smart story with all its twists and turns keeps you captivated throughout, playing along with the characters as you and they try to get to the real truth. It's not a perfect movie. When it tries too hard to be funny, most notably with the character of Ira played by Johnny Galecki who is obviously there for comic relief, the humor falls a little flat. Things work much better when the humor is more subtle. And for as obviously well-thought out as the plot is it doesn't quite all come together perfectly in the end. It all makes sense when you think about it but the movie does seem to get a little bogged down when it ultimately gets around to explaining itself. But all in all Suicide Kings works very well. Somewhat of a hidden gem. "},{"Title":"'The beauty of it ... no one gets hurt.'

I looked it up and found, 'Suicide King is a slang name given to the King of Hearts in a deck of playing cards. In standard decks, it appears that he is stabbing himself in the head with his sword.' And, as you watch the movie, at one point a card game is being played, and it is mentioned that the 'suicide king' was wild. A times it plays like a very dark comedy, but in fact it is a crime mob drama with some humorous elements, but overall has a very dark dramatic tone. Christopher Walken is the main reason for seeing it. He plays mob boss Carlo Bartolucci/Charlie Barret who ends up kidnapped by a group of otherwise nice young men, and held for a unique kind of ransom. All they want is for him to use his crime influence to find and return the kidnapped sister of one of the men, who also is the girlfriend of another of the group. But as we might suspect, nothing goes according to plan and most of the movie is seeing how new developments are handled.Denis Leary is also good as Lono Veccio, Charlie's driver and trigger man. Among the young men kidnappers are Henry Thomas (of E.T fame), Sean Patrick Flanery , and Jay Mohr.SPOILERS FOLLOW. When all is sorted out, and a scene we see near the end explains, the sister/girlfriend was never actually kidnapped, two thugs were hired to make it look like a kidnapping so that she could get $2Million out of Charlie. Which they do, and she and the boyfriend run away to a South Seas island chain (actually Catalina, Ca) and a sailboat. But Charlie and Lono track them down, get them to admit their deception, get the money back, then shoot the two as Charlie and Lono leave. Crime, once again, didn't pay!

Christopher Walken doesn't need to be walking and moving for his character to be dynamic. Tied to a chair is just fine! Someone criticized the romance scenes in this film, all 3 minutes worth! Why do you NEED to know details about what Walken's character has done in the past? You know he's a gangster, you have all seen plenty of gangster films. We don't need backstory on this. All the backstory on the characters that is actually necessary for the story is given in the dialogue that is exchanged throughout the film. This film is not predictable in any way. Each time you think you have fingered the bad guy, you're proven wrong (This was actually very successful in Scream as well, but that is niether here nor there.). This doesn't borrow from Tarantino, as another person commented, a disjointed timeline is not exclusive to Tarantino, although he is the undisputed master of it. This movie is driven purely by dialogue, exchanges of words between people. Walken comes across as the cold-as-ice gangster, never worrying that he won't somehow get out of the mess he is in. He works on each character in his own style, and at his own pace. He plays people against each other, and gets them to admit their darkest sins. There aren't any fancy explosions, perfectly timed jokes, hilarious pratfalls, or any of the other typical tricks that Hollywood dishes out, just an intriguing storyline and some excellent casting. This movie even has a nice trick ending that is not over-explained. I would have to say that this is one of the better films I have seen, and I have no regrets owning it. P.S. I watched the two alternate endings on the DVD, the ending in the film is by far the best, the other two are sell-outs.

There's a crime being committed by several people who trust each other at first, but later start to doubt each other's motivation as things don't go exactly as planned.  There's violence, suspense, and humor.Christopher Walken plays Charlie Barret, formerly Carlo Bartolucci.  His name has changed because he wants to dissociate himself from his past life as a mobster.  Barret actually is the victim of the crime committed by Avery, Max, TK, and Brett played by Henry Thomas, Max Minot, Jeremy Sisto, and Jay Mohr.  Avery's sister Elise, played by Laura Harris, has been kidnapped and is being held for two million dollars.  Even though they are from a rich family, Avery explains that most of the wealth is on paper and not cash so they really don't have the means to pay.  They are holding Barret ransom for the two million dollars to pay the ransom for Avery's sister.  They explain that things have gotten desperate because they have missed the deadline and the original kidnappers are starting to send them Elise's body parts for each hour they continue to be late.  They tell Barret that everything that is taken from Elise will be taken from him until he comes up with the money, so they cut off his pinky to show that they mean business.  Sounds simple, right?Things start to get complicated when unexpected turns of events take place.  For example  They are holding Barret for ransom, but they quickly realize that will identify themselves if they give a phone number where they can be reached by those who would pay the ransom.  Finger pointing and confusion ensue, and all the while, the sly Barret is sizing up his captors looking for the edge.  This is where Walken's presence invades this character.  His characteristic delivery is always fun.  He makes Barret seem to almost be on these kids side even though he is their prisoner.  Barret warns them to let him go before things go wrong, but then when they don't, he seems to be enjoying the theatre of their attempts to keep their plan on track.  He actually smiles ever so slightly on several occasions, looking as though he were  watching all the action from a darkened room with a bucket of popcorn on his lap.  However, you know that he'd dispose of these punks without a second thought if only he weren't tied to that chair.That's as far as I'm willing to go.

One gets the feeling that, having spent his life in a world of sleaze, he knows when something's up.Among the other cast members, there's Denis Leary. I've liked every movie in which I've seen him. There's also Laura San Giacomo (the sister in Sex, Lies and Videotape). And then we have some surprises Henry Thomas (Elliott in E.T.), Johnny Galecki (Leonard on The Big Bang Theory*), Jeremy Sisto (Billy on Six Feet Under) and Brad Garrett (of Everybody Loves Raymond, which I've never seen). Cliff DeYoung used to be a member of a rock group that performed with the Doors, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. What a combo.Basically, it's not a great movie, but it's an enjoyable one. Every cast member puts on a good performance. I recommend the movie.*Today is actually both his birthday and that of his co-star Kunal Nayyar.

I should know, as it's my favourite decade for the genre, and for film in general. There's nothing like a nice piece of sassy, bloody 90's neo noir. On that note, Suicide Kings makes a rewarding, if slight entry into the niche. It's got a well rounded cast, smart ass dialogue and some moments of pure, unfiltered black comedy. Parts of it are unfocused and not all attempts at humour land squarely, but when it's good, it's good, baby. The key ingredient in any crime/comedy? Stupid people. You have to have some dundering friggin morons who think they got what it takes to pull off some idiotic scheme that's well above their pay grade and intellegience level. They show up here in the form of a gaggle of cocky frat boys who attempt to kidnap an ex mafioso for ransom. Slick pretty boy Sean Patrick Flanery, anxious dweeb Johnny Galecki, reserved Doctor Jeremy Sisto, terrified sensitive boy Henry Thomas and arrogent hotshot Jay Mohr. The mafioso is played by...guess. yep, Christopher Walken, silkily dangerous as Charlie Bartolucci, a guy who used to be a guy you don't want to mess with, and as the film progresses, unravels back to that volatile state. Walken spends most of the film tied to a chair and even then finds ways to amuse and terrify with his impish aura. Another key component in these neo noir's an angry bad dude sent to inflict all kinds of pain and suffering on the idiots, personified by wiseass Lono Vecchio (Denis Leary). He hunts them down with verve, also dealing with two clinically insane hit men (Brad Garrett and Frank Medrano, priceless) who are involved as well. The plot thickens to just this side of convoluted, as the boys realize that one amongst them is pulling a nasty Judas on the other four. Leary, like I said before, is capable of staggering gravitas in between sessions of manic joker antics. Here the film stops dead in its tracks midway through so he can teach an abusive father a cringe worthy, painful lesson, preceded by a sorrowful monologue about his youth. It's the best part of the film in the sense that the tone is completely different from every other scene, making it memorable. This one isn't perfect, I wouldn't call it an amazing flick, but it's got moments of pure genius, and overall is pretty fun, if only two thirds of a great one. Worth it for Walken and Leary. It also has a stinger of an ending that goes against the grain and may rub people the wrong way, but I applauded for not pussying out.

Complexities and dilemmas ensue between these five men when they struggle to execute their plans accurately. The film reaches the cast of Jay Mohr, Denis Leary, Sean Patrick Flanery, Henry Thomas, Jeremy Sisto, and Johnny Galecki.Upon watching this film, I was expecting to see a neo-noir thriller with suspense and originality. Unfortunately, what we get is an unoriginal and unnecessarily convoluted crime-thriller tries to be a Quentin Tarantino wannabe. The story shamelessly borrows elements from Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and it fails to execute them with inspiration. When the watch this, you feel like you are watching a remake of Reservoir Dogs with a touch of Pulp Fiction. The five main characters are involved with a kidnapping that goes wrong, then there is the slight non-linear storyline similar to what Tarantino's films are known for. The characters are rather underdeveloped, even Christopher Walken who is the center-stage seems somewhat under constructed. The only candy this film has to offer is some scenes of suspense and tension between the characters. The cast does amazing jobs as their characters, especially Christopher Walken. Other than that, not much else. All in all, Suicide Kings was a bit of a disappointment. Even with its brilliant cast and suspenseful investment, this film fails to come up with anything original.

It is more how the more successful underworld people deal with upper crust people, in this case with the criminal the older, wiser guy who is more than supportive of his kidnappers, even after they cut off his finger.He sees them for what they are. In fact, one he even calls the man, a young nerd who had no part in the kidnapping, but who is used by the others. This respect for the young man is symbolic of the film. All through it, the other four give away their characters to him, and even those who cause him suffering, he relents to and works with, save for one whom he realizes is not capable of being reasoned with.The movie has dull filmography, cinematography, and scenery, so it lags quite a bit, and comes across as something that actually works better on stage.

Angry , menacing, ice cold and funny. Often all at the same time. He carries the movie so much that it is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role. The weakest characters for me were the two gangsters used by the insider for the initial kidnap. They were just too screwball even for a black comedy like this.

I believe he is a brilliant actor, and he has always been one of my favorites (True Romance, Pulp Fiction, A View To A Kill, etc.) Walken is tied to a wheelchair the entire movie, but absolutely carries the entire film. His intelligence, wit, and determination are amazing to watch. Note especially his reaction when one of the kidnappers gives driving directions. Although he is the victim, there is no question that Walken has the boys in his palm the entire time. Also notable is the performance of Dennis Leary, another favorite actor of mine. As the thug who is working for Walken, he is funny, frightening, and violent. A superb performance much like the character he plays in Underworld, another film I highly recommend. The DVD with the multiple endings is especially enjoyable, but thankfully the director decided to put feel-good BS aside and go with the correct ending. A great drama that anyone is sure to enjoy.

Sean Patrick Flannery, Jay Mohr, Henry Thomas and the rest are otherwise great in impersonating desperate yuppie kids.When you see Suicide Kings it's very easy to compare it to the Tarantino-genre (especially Reservoir Dogs), and probably not without reasons.

I agree with the latter group.  This is not a movie that you should go out of your way to see, but you should rent it if there is nothing else that you really want to see.The plot  A bunch of kids (does not include Denis Leary) kidnap a retired mob boss (also not Leary, but is Walken).  Denis Leary  is the trustworthy servant of that boss.  He has a bit part, and they promote as the second biggest star when he should not even be on the cover.  The kids have kidnapped the boss because somebody has kidnapped one of their sisters, and is holding her for $2 mil.  They expect the box to use his connections to free her.  Now the kicker, one of them helped the kidnappers.  The rest of the movie is the interactions of the kids and the boss as they deal with info, and the fact that they cut off a mob boss's finger.  And Leary copes with the fact that he spent $1500 on a pair of boots.  The whole movie goes on, and really leaves everything so wide open that there are several possible endings, and they appear as alternate endings on the DVD.But, who cares?  We've seen the plot, and since it matters so little, let's move on to the acting.Acting  Good, but not great.  Leary rants, and is less energetic than usual.  He has made better rants in The Ref and in No Cure for Cancer.  Walken is up to his usual stuff, and does his usual decent job.  The kids don't shine too well, and everything seems just a little off.  So, what's next?Dialogue  Decent, but nothing to cheer about.  The dialogue is there.  Nothing seems right, and is a little too playful for the type of people that it belongs to.  Why doesn't it work?  Maybe, the writer just does not know the human rhythms.So, why am I giving this a good review?  Maybe it was because I did not expect anything from it.

One movie like it is Deceiver, which has strong acting performances by Tim Roth and Michael Rooker (from HenryPortrait of a Serial Killer).  In comparison, I enjoyed Deceiver more than Suicide Kings due to the stronger overall acting.  Suicide Kings takes a familiar plot and really does not do anything new with it, yet the movie still is enjoyable.  One problem of this movie is the use of music to set the atmosphere.  Instead of the actors defining the mood, the music tries to and it does not work very well.  The music sticks out and distracts one from what is really happening.  It does not help that the actors are just looking around at each other and not doing any acting.  The movie also lacks some motivation in the beginning.  The viewer is left with a feeling of why did this happen or why are they doing this.  The movie just does not work very well as a mystery.  Despite these short comings I liked the movie overall.  The main reason to see it is for Denis Leary and definitely for Christopher Walken.  Denis steals the show when the movie focuses on minor parts of the plot.  When the movie is dealing with the main plot, Walken turns in a really good performance and for that reason alone this movie is worth seeing.  It is Walken after all! Another interesting actor is Henry Thomas.  He does not do a very good job acting but it is fun to see him so many years after he was Elliot in E.T.  I enjoyed Suicide Kings for the most part.

He might not even have taken TV Media in high school. But he still changed the genre. With Reservoir Dogs, he was established. With Pulp Fiction, he was God.Hollywood is like high school. When one does something that really gets popular, it sparks... the trend. And all the others follow suit-- following the leader like cult lemmings. And in film, influence can be essential. Or just sad and embarrassing. Tarantino inspired many--a lot of particular imitators. Some good. And... as for this one? SUICIDE KINGS dares to spin a yarn of a quartet of wealthy privileged youngsters who dream up... and then try the most desperate and daring of schemes... The reformed mobster is on his way home one night after an invigorating evening out. There's an ambush, he's attacked. He comes to... only to find himself bound-and-gagged in a chair somewhere. What the hell's going on?A hostage film. A mob-crime flick. And also eventually... kind of mystery whodunnit? thriller, the plot twists and turns--especially in the last quarter of the picture. Just a bunch of boys having fun. Bein' boys--not unlike Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.The Godfather in question finds in a cabin somewhere surrounded by rich collegiate in nice suits who seem to fancy themselves their own independent Mafioso. He sees red--on someone's shirt, as it's covered in the Goodfella's blood. The whole plan goes as wrong as we'd expect and the spoiler richies panic--and then these dumb rich silver spoons all turn on each other. SUICIDE KINGS boasts one of those casts that we'd expect from the latest Tarantino picture. Christopher Walken, Laura Harris, Jeremy Sisto, Brad Garrett, Jay Mohr, Johnny Galecki, Sean Patrick Flanery, Henry Thomas, Laura San Giacomo and Dennis Leary.OK, not quite the highest-of-profile names for the most part. But still, everyone does a worthwhile job. Only Walken, Leary and Galecki only really stand-out. Walken confirms the belief that any scene he's in--just flat-out works. Even when the screenplay gives him the most ludicrous insights But I come from out there, and everybody out there knows, everybody lies cops lie, newspapers lie, parent's lyin'. The one thing you can count on - word on the street... yeah, that's solid. Uh-huh. That's why so many schoolyard and water-cooler rumors are considered holy fact.Walken sees how nervous they all are (who wouldn't be?) and attempts to get them to turn on each other. Seeing as it's a typical hostage situation with the victim being tied to a chair--he tries the usual of divide-and-conquer. There's an inside guy. A mole, he tells them. But who? When they do finally start playing poker, Walken reads them easily.Leary has the most fun in his role doing what I suppose can best be described as the quintessential Denis Leary role. He's Denis Leary in the mob. Ranting about his wife and his expensive footwear. Doing a good deed and then bring down his usual Biblical wrath. Galecki is kind of fun as the rich worrywart nebbish whose family owns the place and seems a lot more concerned with mud being tracked on the floor, what happening to his father's favorite chair than the fact that a mobster is bound and he know everyone's name...All the other actors--they get a passing grade, but they don't quite stand out. SUICIDE KINGS is like that--hit-and-miss. The whole abduction is so badly planned--the movie itself even takes notice of this. At one point in the movie, Walken's character says to his captors You guys didn't think this through too good, did you? Anyone with a handful of working brain cells will be thinking the same thing. I kind of wanted to ask the filmmakers this. The amount of obvious mistakes these guys make. Oh, they're clearly not professionals.The movie's screenwriters Josh McKinney, Gina Goldman and Wayne Allen Rice take Don Stanford's original short story The Hostage from and heavily Quentin Tarantino-ize it. Some thought they paid homage real proper. Some thought all this seems like something at best he might have in the bottom of his drawer--and forgot about forever. Director Peter O' Fallon has real flair and style. He certainly films this thing with a lot of energy to spare. The kind we've seen best in... well, you know where. He gives a lot of wild-child style and so does everyone else involved.Heist/kidnapping movies that deal with inside jobs just gotta have that moment where the ship's going down in flame and the rats all turn on each other.SUICIDE KINGS is still worth a look for a slow night. Better than a lot of the merde being crapped out of Hollywood's big uncreative anus. SUICIDE KINGS doesn't beat the house and take the pot, but like poker, it's not a bad way to spend a slow night with your friends. And in the end... Well... This is all pretty unbelievable. The ending however, is inevitable. And makes all the sense in the world.See, for me--The Suicide Kings seems more like Jon Favreau's Swingers than the Reservoir Dogs. Hey, maybe that was another source of inspiration!You might have to see it more than once to really get it all straight. Take notes, if you have to. Not to give anything away at all, but just to close it all on this one poetic line Sometimes the ends really do justify the means. Or at least define the meaning of the words 'karma' and 'justice'.--Having Really Enjoyed It, Dane Youssef "},{"Title":"A couple of years back, I was looking through a copy of Maxim magazine and I found a list of 20 films saved by having Christopher Walken in them.","Date":"4 June 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Mystery","Review":" A couple of years back, I was looking through a copy of Maxim magazine and I found a list of 20 films saved by having Christopher Walken in them. As you have probably guessed, Suicide Kings was among the 20, actually, I believe it was number 3.This was Peter O'Fallon's premiere film for the big screen (he has since made only one other, although he continues to direct numerous television series), and there are a lot of things that might have gone a little better. The dialog is weak in spots, the premise of a made guy going off with a bunch of preppy kids is a little off the wall, and the overall feel of the film drags from time to time. But that doesn't mean it is a total failure.As a matter of fact, just the opposite. Needless to say Walken and Leary come off exceptionally well, and the remainder of the cast is believable. Johnny Galecki comes off as Johnny Galecki, which is to say his dialog and acting are better suited to his current role in Big Bang Theory than to the big screen. Jay Mohr, well, I never have like Mohr, so I can tell you his character is passable, but he never quite rises to the level needed for his part. Henry Thomas and Sean Patrick Flannery both give good performances, and are really the two character who draw your interest. Jeremy Sisto as the medical student tending to Walken is more than adequate to the role, and you can see the young actor's ability flourishing into the actor he has become.As to the film itself, the plot, once you get past the implausible part, is good and moves pretty well, although there is a lot of exposition that seems pointless until you get to the very end. By then, unfortunately, you lose interest, unless you are a die hard Walken fan (guilty as charged).Since I have the DVD (yes, I pulled it out of the bargain bin at WalMart), I've watched the alternative endings and listened to O'Fallon's comments, and the one that struck me the most was his comparison of the final scene of the film to one in The Usual Suspects. Hmmm. Not even close, Pete.Rated R for violence, language, torture, and some nudity, this film is one you might want to rent just to see why television directors who are really good at their jobs should stick to television.

Fortunately, in Suicide Kings, Christopher Walken is on top of his game, and witnessing the man's impeccable delivery and strange, threatening but disarming screen presence is enough to persuade me to see any movie, regardless of the rest of the cast members. But, again, fortunately for us the other actors are talented too, especially Dennis Leary, who nota bene improvised most of his dialog.

After Avery's (Henry Thomas) sister is kidnapped, they hatch a plan to do a little kidnapping of their own. The man they pick is Carlo/Charlie (Christopher Walken), a retired mobster who they suspect can 'use his contacts' to free the girl. Charlie's motivation to help, in addition to not being killed, is that he will be returned to his home in the exact same condition that Elise Chasten is returned home in. The man in charge is Bret (Jay Mohr), who hatches the plan and plays the role of 'bad cop' for most of the movie. T.K. (Jeremy Sisto), a fledgling med student, monitors Charlie's health and provides the voice of reason in many instances. Also along for the ride is Max Minot (Sean Patrick Flanery), Avery's pal and Elise's fiancé. The group brings Ira (Johnny Galecki) in on the plan only after he agrees to let them use his parents' summer home for the night. The man responsible for recovering Charlie is Lono (Denis Leary), his driver. As time winds down, the boys' inexperience becomes more and more apparent ('you didn't think this through too good, did you? Charlie once comments), and Charlie's ever-worsening health becomes a major cause for concern. It's only a matter of time before Charlie decides to help the kids out, and he plays them against one another by showing them that the kidnappers may be much closer to home than they could have imagined.Suicide Kings is a good film not because of the big names, but because of those who have since become big names. Christopher Walken plays the same kind of character that made Christopher Walken famous, and Denis Leary plays the same kind of character that made Denis Leary famous. Who really shines in this film is Jay Mohr. His performance as Bret showcases his true talent. He makes the character into someone who is so sure he's right, you wonder if it isn't him behind the curtain pulling the strings. Jeremy Sisto turns in another solid performance as T.K. As the man keeping Charlie alive, and the first one to have any real conversation with the mobster, T.K. spends most of the movie with information that could tear the entire operation apart, while at the same time trying to keep cool and keep his friends cool. Johnny Galecki as Ira is also worth noting. Ira is the runt of the group, not a little spineless, and is eager to constantly remind Charlie that he had nothing to do with the kidnapping. Flanery and Thomas are good as well, but not the kind of good that makes you think only they could have pulled the roles off.Overall, Suicide Kings is an imperfect, but still enjoyable movie. There are times when you're sure you've figured it out, only to find yourself second-guessing minutes later. With equal bits of comedy, drama and thriller, Suicide Kings is no waste of time.

Before I go off in a fit of rage, I'd like to say that I did enjoy Walken and Leary here....they just got shafted by everything else but it's not their fault. They were both more than decent and are SK's only redeeming qualities whatsoever.SK is a classic example of a film that's very mildly entertaining on it's first viewing, but because of it's twists and red herrings the replay value is shot to about zero. It doesn't have respect for the audience's intelligence or perceptive skills. You really begin to realize how bad it is once you've seen it more than once. I like movies that I can watch time and time again like most people, so you can guess what I think about that. I remember it being a tad retarded, so I decided to give it another chance for my review. It was worse than I remembered it to be.It loses points right off for casting Henry Thomas, the epitome of a wuss who can't do much else, and Sean P. Flanery...the most fake and fabricated actor in a long time. I've only seen Flanery in this film, that I know of, and he's simply unconvincing and annoying to the point of throwing me into spasms of violence and utter destruction. This is best personified in his lame MTV-esque kidnapping sequence in which we're forced to swallow our own bile as he tries to act like he's in love with this chick and cares about her. It's pathetic, and not only that, I really don't like the taste of bile, not even my own. As of right now, it's the worst acting scene I can bring to mind in any film I've seen recently. Like I said, bad, bad MTV video....which can also be attributed to the director, whoever the hell he is. Yuck.The conclusion is typical of the film itself, it jumps around too much and never really gets anywhere or solves anything. And besides, who gives a s&*% about a bunch of poor, poor, rich kids with a little debt anyways? Boo-hoo. Not me. I was hoping and praying for an all out slaughter-fest of pure hatred and merciless vengeance with a dash of mad fury fueled by the embodiment of true evil. I did not get that and I was p*ssed. I'm going to try and go enjoy life now and get this crap out of my head before someone gets hurt. I am baffled at it's lofty rating. As one fellow reviewer suggested, when someone mentions they like or enjoy this film, end all relations immediately. People who enjoy films like these are the reason for the lack of quality in Hollywood these days.

He was excellent in Boondock Saints and I wanted to see more of his work.  In that, I was not disappointed by Suicide Kings.Unfortunately, Suicide Kings suffers from the illness of a well-written bad plot.  There are some excellent lines, and these three actors in particular deliver great performances, both in dialogue and in soliloquy.  But the movie as a whole is far too contrived.  The last few twists in the film tip the scales on what had previously been a smart balance between light and dark, between humor and suspense.  The movie spirals into a final act that leaves a viewer feeling empty, even cheated.  Perhaps this was director Peter O'Fallon's intention... being as this was his first film, he might have been looking to make an impact, do something avant-garde, etc.Regardless, there is some excellent acting, great dialogue, humor and suspense.  The movie works, and works well, up until the last five or ten minutes.  I'm glad I saw Suicide Kings, but I doubt I'll be watching it again any time soon.  Or at least I'll be excusing myself before the final act to get a fresh drink or hit the bathroom.

Screenwriters often make characters either complete idiots or geniuses that make no mistakes.  This movie is unpredictable, much like actual life is. A lot of movies will have unrealistic endings that make the audience happy or make large holes in logic to have the most shocking ending (Wild Things comes to mind), I believe that this movie could pretty much happen in real life.

Mostly it's funny and charming, not too dark.  Once it settles into the preposterous idea that these young amateurs could succeed in kidnapping this ex `capo di tutti capi', it has to go into the realm of comedy.  Here Christopher Walken is no longer outwardly angry with them, but chatty, sort of enjoying himself.  Other reviews say that J. Galecki's character is badly done, but I disagree.  The other characters straddle the edge between comedy and seriousness, while Ira is a flat out caricature of the wimp of the group.  Between him and a very amused Walken, it morphs firmly into a comedy with interesting plot twists.The chosen ending (you see two others on the DVD) was, in my opinion, too dark for the rest of the movie.  Barrett seems like a quite reasonable guy by the end.  Guess why they chose it?  It tested best for the under 25 demographic. (After testing, it's too bad the marketing group didn't have enough money to spend on actual advertising.)   I thought it left a bad taste to an otherwise lighthearted movie.  Wonder how the original short story ended...There are other flaws, like the unnecessary flashback with Laura San Giacomo, but seeing Walken in a 70s outfit and long wig is more than worth it!I rented this thinking `oh, another Tarantino-like noirish pseudo-hip guy-movie', but it was MUCH better than that--a very funny movie with great lines.  Walken and Leary are both very likable.  Leary's character is very close to the one he played on the very funny, short-lived TV show The Job. (Whatever happened to that, ABC?)

You would think the story itself, the characters, Christopher Walken's creepy and twisted performance, or maybe even Denis Leary's funny and, characteristically, foul-mouthed Lono. You would be close with the last one, but not one hundred percent. In fact the thing I like most has absolutely no relevance to the story at all. The best thing, I found in the movie, was Denis Leary's uncharacteristic calmness when he tells the story of the time he tatooed his own father with a baseball bat after he found his mother, beaten. There is a certain eerie tranquility that accompanies that scene as Leary tells this story to a man who savages his step-daughter, culminating in one of the most calm, yet believable, threats ever. The best thing is, no matter what your opinion is of Leary in the rest of the movie, you will feel more able to see him as a likeable guy for what he does in that scene than anything.Don't get me wrong, the movie is unbelievable. It's slick, it's stylish. It has a dark cool which puts it into the same league as 'Pulp Fiction' and other films like it, yet it stays unique in its deliverance. Filled with twists and turns which make it better and better, this is an unmissable gem.

One that makes you think until the end, and well, even if it doesn't, you enjoy the movie in all it's entirety.The acting was superb. This is a movie done in chronological order, so talk about character build up. I saw Jay Mohr as a boy dying of AIDS in the movie Playing By Heart and comparing him to the obsessive compulsive jerk Brett in this movie made me see what an amazingly talented actor he is.Christopher Walken, who we all recognize as a talented actor, comes across as an even more talented actor as he does practically the entire movie duct taped to a chair. Christopher Walken said he really had to concentrate on the lines for this movie, since he really depends on body language and it shows.Henry Thomas has come a long way from ET. I thought him particularly amazing when he was explaining his motives to his friends, the tears were wonderful.Although Sean Patrick Flannery portrayed my least favorite character, he too did well during his character's climax. And Jeremy Sisto was a wonderful level headed druggy who added a sense of balance to one screwed up group. Johnny Galecki was great, what a nervous lead from the way too cool guy he played on Roseanne. And Denis Leary was an awesome comic relief- if only we could all swear that casually.The plot was great, despite the fact certain big wigs in the reveiwing area thought the ending was weak. I didn't think it that way at all. Twists and turns and shockers ahead. From having the boys have the upper hand, to suddenly letting Charlie have it, and finding out that one of their own was not at all on their side, and even after discovering who it was, having one final shock for the ending. That my friends, in my opinion does not a weak ending make.All in all, Suicide Kings is the perfect movie to rent, and to watch at any time. After seeing it 9 times it still makes me laugh as though I was seeing it the first time, making me want to watch it again. Worth the three dollars, or paying the whole amount to own it, Suicide Kings is one you should definitley not miss.

They hold him hostage and he cleverly manipulates them to fight with each other. there's nothing too dark, and the dialog and dynamic with the younger characters is really solid. Dennis Leary's mobster role is funny and angry and brutal in just the right doses.***Possible spoiler*** Most of the way through the film I was convinced there would be a killer climax. The problem is that the story is leading you to believe that there's an inside man... but when you find out who it really is, it seems misleading. The motivations behind the actions of the kidnappers don't quite add up, particularly Avery and Max's interaction. The flashback sections of the story lead you to think one way, but don't come off as too convincing. On the other hand, the movie's good at digging into these different personalities and Walken, Leary and the Ira character are really compelling. (It seems a lot of people didn't like Ira but he's pretty a very important foil for the others and the film would lose a lot without him. Plus, he's awfully convincing as the uptight kiss-up geek.) The twists are pretty cool, and not too tricky to get, just a little contradictory when you consider all the different ways the movie could have gone.

For all the reasons IMDb users have given over the years Reservoir Dogs.Two almost-as-good? Two Days In The Valley and, yup, Suicide Kings.So-so? The Usual Suspects over-hyped, overwrought, over-valued.Weak? Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead -- everyone ran out of inspiration after conjuring up the title.Immediate discard? No doubt about it Wild Things, as mechanistic a mess of a movie has ever reached the screen, the plotline seemingly created by a computer program of mind-numbing sterility.But Suicide Kings? Ah, sublime stuff, downgraded here from top rank only because it is so often in the Tarantino school rather than distinct in its own right. But this is celebration, not mere emulation Leary's monologues make for a finely honed pastiche, whilst one climactic scene (no, no spoilers here) is the Dogs' warehouse tableaux pointedly, wittily, re-staged.A class act, then, and from all concerned sharp, fast, direction, skilled editing, some joyous dialogue (particularly where Christopher Walken is concerned, an actor imbued with an innate and charismatic immobility here -- cue joke -- rendered even more immobile for most of the movie, yet responsible for one of the most animated (and funny) performances he's ever given.Downside? Apparently the movie's ending was decided by a preview audience, a bunch of people I don't know, will never meet, and in whom I have no interest whatsoever. So why've I had to pay to see on film what passes through their collective brain (on the evidence of this film, plainly, not a lot)?Niggles aside though for sheer creativity, rich humour (the hidden gags -- Walken=immobile=totally unmoving, the Dogs' subtly, briefly reprised warehouse tableau -- inevitably work better than the more overt comedy) and, above all, boundless energy, Suicide Kings is a high card all the way, a stand-out in this now increasingly overcrowded genre.Pity about the final scenes though.

It came to light in the late 90's when crime drama was the word and though it may seem a direct re-imagining of some greater (and worse) films in the genre, the suspense and whodunit nature of the movie really puts it near the top of the list in my opinion. Comparisons to Usual Suspects will abound, but Suicide Kings holds it's own. I have read contrary views to this, but it is my assessment that Henry Thomas (yes, from E.T.), Jay Mohr, Denis Leary, and Christopher Walken blend really well together in this movie.Long story short A group of trust fund preppies kidnaps a known mob boss to fix a situation involving one of the young men's kidnapped sister- he can either pay the ransom or use his connections to find out who is behind the sister-snatching. Walken plays the mob boss to a hilt, and he turns the heat up on his kidnappers by suggesting (through his outside connections) that it may have been an inside job. Once this monkey wrench is thrown into the system, the men start doubting each other and themselves, and it is clear that they are in over their heads.The DVD of Suicide Kings has a few alternate endings, one of which I personally prefer over the actual ending.

He's a retired mafioso who ends up being taken hostage by four New York preppies as leverage, since Avery's (Henry Thomas) sister, Elise has been kidnapped by two psycho hoodlums (including Everybody Loves Raymond's Brad Garrett). Walken is supposed to supply them with connections and foot the bill for the $2,000,000 ransom money. Jay Mohr is the mastermind of the plan, a semi-psycho control freak who may have more at stake than anyone else knows. Johnny Galecki is hilarious as Ira, the guy who loaned his house to his four friends for poker and freaks out when he finds a mobster dct-taped to his father's favorite chair. Sean Patrick Flanery, Elise's boyfriend, and Jeremy Sisto, as a junkie male nurse round out the accomplices in the kidnap scheme. What Walken learns from his attorney is that, most likely, the other kidnappers used an inside player, and begins to turn everyone against each other, systematically.During all of this, Denis Leary, as Walken's sociopathic driver, is prowling New York City (actually Los Angeles) for anyone who knows anything about either of the kidnappings. In the meantime he raves on with liberal profanity with his partner, about everything from his $5000 boots to the cheap graphite golf club he uses to bean another another gangster into submission with in a strip club.The movie has one or two twists that don't quite gel. And it is definitely a dark and tense story, with only some mild comedy bits to warrant any laughs.One scene in particularly vexes me. Denis Leary's character, Lono Veccio, tells an abusive alcoholic father about his own father and grandfather. His grandfather came over from Ireland with the alcoholic gene. His father inherited it.

Suicide Kings' younger stars, who could've brought a lot of neat depth to the film, only offer whiney characters that just don't go anywhere or give you anything to be sympathetic to.I really wish the film were better. As a viewer, I kept giving the film more brains than it had. Some of my erroneous thoughts about what could have happened, but didn't ... They didn't really cut off Walken's finger, they drugged him and told him it was (they would've shown him a cadaver's finger)... At the end, Denis Leary tries to take over the mob by shooting Walken, so he can ascend in the ranks ... Ira somehow being involved, and just playing dumb ...Ah! Enough of that, just take my word for it, this film isn't worth seeing.

But even Mr. Walken, and the very strong supporting cast they've assembled here can't overcome a weak script and an obviously under-funded, while well-meaning movie.Convoluted heist yarns tend to suffer when the viewer is asked too many times to fill in the dots. The alternative has the movie foreshadowing characters or locations. There has to be a  reason, and the alert viewer will have the puzzle put together long before the story ends.Without the foreshadowing the viewer struggles to remember the relationships between characters and  locales, this quickly leads to disinterest, and then disgust. Arghh!Only a few (recently The Usual Suspects comes to mind) manage to straddle this gap effectively, so don't even begin to expect this from Suicide Kings.Dennis Leary is a highlight, in a roll written exactly for his temperament.Otherwise stillborn.

Their ill-fated plan consists of abducting gangster Carlo Bartolucci (Christopher Walken) and trying to use his mob ties to insure the safe return of Elise (Laura Harris), who happens to be Max's (Sean Patrick Flanery) sweetheart. Their plan is well conceived but they do not know what they have gotten themselves into. Everything begins to fall apart as Charlie begins to figure the kids out and starts playing mind games with them as his right-hand man Lono (Denis Leary) closes in on their location.Christopher Walken is stellar, in a role perfect for him, as Carlo. Denis Leary's biting comedy style is well suited for his character Lono. The rest of the cast put on excellent performances as well covering a wide range of characters types and personalities. Overall the movie is very good in both plot and acting..

The good points are Christopher Walken I thought he was perfect for this movie and gave a great performance. He is one of the few actors who can make bad dialogue sound good. Secondly I loved the ending I'm not taking about the twist I will get to them, but the very ending. Without giving anything away you don't get the usual happy ending. The bad points. I would have liked to have seen more of Laura Harris so you could get a feel for the kidnapped girl. The Dialogue was not always great, but I did love the monologue in the middle of the movie by Denis Leary. The plot was full of holes with a lot of movie coincidence thrown in. The twists which is hard to explain without adding a spoiler, but when the final twist is revealed it makes the brothers role so far fetched and for everything to come together just to much. I hope that makes some sense. Despite what I have said it is defiantly worth seeing for its comedy and Walken.

Not matter how crappy the movie is, if he's in it, I'll give it a go.That having been said, Suicide Kings is totally awful. Walken in a ridiculous wig at one point in the movie is laughable. None of the characters are memorable or interesting. That guy from Roseanne (Darlene's boyfriend) who plays Ira in this movie is intolerably annoying. I don't understand why one of the other characters doesn't just smack him, because I wanted to. The dialog is unrealistic and frustratingly awful. The story is full of uninteresting plot elements, and the director tries to weave a suspenseful tale to keep you guessing, but I lost interest. The ending was hacked together after some test audience screenings, and the way it is shot and edited, you have no idea what happens! Give this one a miss. Not even worth renting.

The only characters that save the movie are the old-crime-king (Walken) and his driver (Leary) .. But, even these two actors are somewhat below their well-known quality, because of the messy and amateurish dialog .. The young actors show no talent at all, even if they have some .. Only the wanna-be-doctor character, T.K., is somewhat interesting, the rest, especially Ira, kept be irritated all the time .. No character study is visible, no motivation, nothing .. The lines are spoken with no mind nor soul .. Without Walken (and Leary) this movie would be in the trash ..The saving feature of the movie is its plot (not the script, but the general plot) - the reason why my rating is above half-way point .. Several ideas are certainly unique, but the negative aspects corrupt the movie to the roots ..Bottom Line - Minimal enjoyment for crime/thriller fans ..

Under the circumstances, the screenwriters, Josh McKinney, Gina Goldman, and Wayne Rice, working from a short story by Dan Stanford, do a fine job with the suspenseful and dramatic moments, but they fail to keep a consistent intrigue throughout. They take an interesting idea with original prospects and put them into a movie where the main character spends most his time tied to a chair bleeding to death. While there are some unpredictable twists, intense thematic moments, and strong performances, the movie does not provide quite enough to warrant a recommendation. 	Suicide Kings contains some very violent scenes, but doesn't really take advantage of having a dreaded and powerful mobster as the main character. For the most part, the film makes up for its lack of action with ample amounts of explicit declaratives and obscenities. If we knew more about him, witnessed some of his devious doings, and were provided with more information, we may have felt what the characters experienced, but the movie provides no such development. 	The film places five rich young men in a situation way over their heads. This is supposed to immediately increase the tension we feel, but like I said, we do not feel what they are experiencing because there is no proper introduction. The five friends are Avery (Henry Thomas), Brett (Jay Morh), Max (Sean Patrick Flanery), T.K. (Jeremy Sisto), and Ira (Johnny Galecki), who kidnap the most authoritative underground figure around. His name is Charles Barrett (Christopher Walken), who also goes by another name, but to avoid confusion, we'll stick with Barrett alone. Several criminals kidnapped Avery's sister and Max's girlfriend, Lisa (Laura Harris) and the police are unable to find her. The amateurs demand that Barrett, with his immense underground connections, dish out the ransom of two million dollars and locate the position of Lisa.  	The acting is what makes the movie involving. Christopher Walken can't really do much tied to a chair, but the scenes he does contribute his talent to are taut and imitating through a cunningly convincing evil appearance. Jay Morh comes off as a surprise after getting his career off to a comedic start. Sean Patrick Flanery supplies a rich and intriguing performance. Dennis Leary fabricates a smooth and uncompromising character of subtle humor and startling brutality. 	Suicide Kings offers some intelligent dialogue, but often recycles it from better movies like Pulp Fiction. It is getting to the point where we are going to have to give Hollywood a new genre stories that borrow anything they can from Quentin Tarantino films. Suicide Kings has a good setup and better plot complications, but with its main active character strung to a chair for most of the running time, its only a matter of time before the movie starts to wander and kill time until the next momentous occurrence transpires.
