I first saw this film when I was 10 years old, and have been a huge fan ever since. While the acting is superb, and the story is top notch, the real star of this film is the 170 pound Labrador/Mastiff mix named Spike who played the part of Yeller with heart and soul. If you are one of the few in the world who does not know the story of Old Yeller, be warned that you may shed tears after seeing what many consider to be one of the most heartbreaking scenes in movie history. But that scene only makes you love this movie even more as through tragedy comes hope and learning experiences. Don't miss one of the greatest classics of all time.

The technical aspects are great (that color!), the acting believable and naturalistic, and the story moves along at a really nice pace.  There's nothing condescending or cutesy here, and the plot point of the kid trying to play grown up (ie, Tommy Kirk as man of the house while his father's away) is played out without the traps that so many coming-of-age films fall into  In this boy's world, being an adult is about working and taking responsibility, not sneaking drinks and experimenting with sex.  Also, the messages were woven nicely into the script, not tacked on and rammed over your head.  It also helped that they had actors, rather than stars.

It does have obvious correlations with Marjorie Rawling's The Yearling. I first saw this film on TV when I was six years old or so. Interestingly, at that time, I remember the Chuck Connors character as menacing and almost evil. On viewing as an adult, that character was a perfect gentleman, giving up the dog to the boy when he was under absolutely no obligation to do so. Also interesting to see the casual, and basically unnoticed cruelty of the Travis character toward the little girl. I don't remember even noticing that as a child. Disney knew how to make real family entertainment in those days. Now, it seems that material suitable for children is targeted directly at them, and is generally a chore for adults to sit through.

There's something in the saga of the Coates family and that yellow mutt that touches the kid in all of us. Fess Parker, wife Dorothy McGuire, and sons Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran are the Coates family scratching out a living on a small ranch on the Texas frontier. Dad has to drive their herd to market in Kansas and he leaves the other three behind. Parker though he's second billed in the cast has barely fifteen minutes of screen time in the film. He leaves before the main action starts and returns really as anti-climax. Nevertheless he was a big name back in 1957, coming fresh off his triumph as Disney's Davy Crockett. Didn't hurt him at all to come from Texas for this part.So McGuire is left to cope with the kids, the farm, and a newly found stray yellow dog that both the boys take to. His coloring makes his name a natural and he proves quite a useful dog, earning more than his keep on the ranch.Sad to say though that Old Yeller provides the saddest moment in any Disney film since Bambi's mother was shot by the hunters. I really can't say too much more, but the Coates boys prove to be made of stern stuff and Dad provides some sound country wisdom as he gets back from his cattle drive.Because the setting is out in the wilds there are few human speaking parts. All the players here are well cast, but the one who's the best by far is Jeff York as the Coates neighbor Mr. Searcy. York appeared in a whole bunch Disney features and usually stole scenes in every one of them. York's a guy who's full of wisdom in his own right, he'll dispense with advice at the drop of a hat, but when there's work to be done is usually elsewhere. McGuire does remark it's no accident he's not on the cattle drive. When she needs help on the ranch, York delegates his daughter Beverly Washburn to stay behind. She's a sweet kid and a good worker and Tommy Kirk doesn't mind having her around at all. Chuck Connors is also in this as a visiting trail boss and I wouldn't be surprised if his appearance here in this family feature led to his family television series, The Rifleman.Fifty years after it was released Old Yeller is still good entertainment and will be making young folks dream about that idyllic boyhood the Coates kids have on those Texas plains.

Granted, the scenes showing Old Yeller fighting off the animal villains had a somewhat unnatural look about them; but getting a herd of wild pigs, for example, to do what you want, can't be too easy.

Not long afterward, we bought a Golden Retriever puppy and it was a fabulous dog.After a long, long absence, I saw it for the third time in the late1990s on VHS. Since I never forgot the sad ending, I was prepared for that. My attitude was great going in, especially since I had become a fan of Dorothy McGuire since her magnificent performance in A Tree Grows In Brooklyn.Anyway - hey, I have to be honest - this time around I was disappointed. I think I expected too much since the film had such strong nostalgia value. Yes, it was still a nice old-fashioned story but the impact was so-so and McGuire looked like she had aged 20 years since Brooklyn. She didn't look like the same person from the famous 1945 drama.Tommy Kirk went on to be a star on television and in the movies for Walt Disney while I don't believe Kevin Corcoran, who was just as good as Kirk, did a whole lot after this....some westerns into the '60s. Good 'ole Davy Crockett, Fess Parker, also is in this movie but has a minor role, being seen only in the beginning and at the end. Chuck Connors also had a small role.A nice story, no doubt.

It's a wonderful movie with a touching and believable story line. Travis and his younger brother Arliss perform flawlessly, though their mother may seem too passive for a frontier woman. The sudden appearance of Chuck Connors (Burn Sanderson) enlightens the story line with a light romantic undertone.The movie teaches young kids the values of hard work, family love, neighborly support, hospitality and pretty much everything that today's movies seem to overlook as too mundane and banal. I strongly recommend this movie to young and old and give it a rating of 10. In my view the movie should be judged in its genre which is family/kids and not be compared with better adult performances in more serious movies. Surely, Tommy Kirk is not Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mocking Bird but his performance is just the same for a kid of his age in a family movie.

Well, I guess I just wanted to give in since she bugged me every phone conversation from that point on.Old Yeller is a lost dog that comes across a western set family who's father has headed for money and items for his family. When they find Old Yeller, it's like he's taken the father's position, protecting the family every chance he got.

Yeller is a smart dog and acts as a guardian for the family.Yeller is in fact the protagonist of the story. His personality is well developed and he steals our hearts with no effort. The dog playing Yeller was one expressive canine. You can very clearly see the emotions on his face. It is romanticized depiction of the old west but who cares. The location is picturesque. There are plenty of animals; lizards, snakes, toads, hogs, horses, cows, bears, wolves and of course dogs. They seem to be well-trained; most of their scenes look extremely natural. Add to that, the characters are all charming as simple, hard-working and good-natured folk. And, you have an enjoyable little movie for both kids and adults.

The gorgeous color photography, the warm family narrative, and a jaunty title song all conspired to make the picture a box-office winner, but the main reason it's called a Disney Classic today is because of that dog.

I just plain old can't get excited about seeing a western. It's a lot easier to do when it's a Disney film though, and I have seen the original Parent Trap with scenes that take place on a ranch. And like most Disney films, that film really worked it's magic on me and inevitably I thought the California frontier of Mitch's ranch was a lot nicer and more inviting than Boston. So I was able to watch Old Yeller, for the first time, and enjoy it just enough because Disney film-making crews really knew how to shoot the land this was filmed on. So Old Yeller is such a good-looking movie, that if it weren't for the times and harshness of survival in the wilderness, you might want to live there. Yes, this is really a movie about a family's survival in the wilderness. And along the way, a boy and his dog have some adventures, and the boy learns the value of being a man.Which is something we've learned about children and most kids today have at least a chance at a real childhood. The main character of this film surely is the boy Travis and how he has to do all the man's work in his family when the father is gone and how he hasn't time to be a boy. He does each day's man-sized chores but his relationship with the dog Old Yeller allows him to indulge a little in a second childhood he might not have had to enjoy living on the land. So where perhaps Disney's Bambi robbed viewer's of some information regarding the loss of an animal as more than a pet or wild game, this film really shows how much this dog means to the family and Travis. So there is quite an emotional load of work to do as an actor for little Tommy Kirk who portrays the boy Travis. And if it weren't for both the tender moments between him and the dog, as well as him and the sweet little girl Lisbeth, and him putting his survival skills to the test, we would have Disney fluff. Which is not what Old Yeller is.Old Yeller is a very powerful film, but more than at the outset, where everyone might think the film is about the dog, it's really about the boy and his amazing duties. It really makes a viewer have to respect the old frontier land, especially farmers and families that shows like Little House on the Prairie made an example out of. The film can be a little hard on the viewer though. What is one supposed to think of the child Arliss? He helps the mother and Lisbeth load up a big wagon of corn and loves and cares for the dog, as well as the dog's puppy, Young Yeller. But too often his role in the film is to be somewhat of a troublemaker. That he does a little too well, and that mixes my feelings about the supporting characters. Though it's really just limited to this boy and his rash attitude. He is told by his mother to mind his older brother's instructions, and he consistently defies Travis. I don't want to sound like a slighted older brother myself, though I am an older brother - it's not an easy job.The character of the mother, or Katie, is the film's strongest supporting character. Fess Parker was really the King of all of Disney's western and frontier-themed entertainment, but his role in this film accounts for less than 10 minutes total screen time. He's most important in the film in two short capacities, he has to be a good role model for Travis, which he is because he is very aptly able to build up Travis's confidence again, but he also has to leave. Because how can a boy learn how to be a man with a male role model around? I'm not sure many movies have tried to answer that riddle, though movies and television have produced some great father figures, the boy who's job is to become a man, he never seems to be able to do it with a father around. Which is unfortunate, since in reality so many family units are forced to make due without fathers. Or worse yet- good fathers. The mother displays more than enough parental responsibility, which just goes to again make a statement about the central importance of mothers.Not a lot of westerns give the growing boy this meaty a role, but Tommy Kirk is the star of this movie for certain. And his dramatic abilities are so advanced, I almost worry for what he must have been going through at the time, and at such a young age, that he's able to get to such sensitive and heartfelt territory so effectively.

It was just wonderful to see the dog's reactions and his behaviors showed that time went into the training of the dog.Even the child actor who played Arliss was good, he was impressive in his portrayal and I ended up loving him as his pocket never seemed to lack anything but fun.Yeller was a stray dog that happened to come into the life of the Coates family when their father, went out to search for work.His coming was welcomed by the youngest of the Coates, Arliss who always wanted a dog, but the eldest Travis was not so happy to have this new inclusion into the family and was ready to do anything to get Yeller out of the house. Travis changed his mind when one day he was in trouble and there was nobody around but Old Yeller to jump in and save him. (I'm purposely leaving out enough details so that you can enjoy the movie if you have not seen it yet)Walt Disney himself was the producer of this family hit, and it was well received by all who has seen it, the movie can be said to stand as one of the best films about a boy and his dog, although Walt Disney (the company) has tried many other dog and boy movies like Homeward Bound or Savage Sam, but none comes close to the kind of dramatic, adventure fun that Old Yeller delivers.The movie was well received as said and it brought in cash for Disney, so much so that the movie has been re-released, you will always find the DVD of Old Yeller available anywhere, so if like me you waited this long to see it, then maybe you should not wait any longer.

Bud Searcy is more like an anecdote and hopelessly lazy and boring but still hilarious.However, I think Travis and Katie are harsh on Arliss at times and they don't always give him proper explanations when he's asking a question. Plus, it bothers me a bit that Travis is always the one having the dogs for himself. Katie says that Travis had a dog when he was a child but Arliss didn't. For the 1st time, Arliss gets a dog - Yeller. Travis is a selfish douche towards Yeller at first. He changes a lot, which I think it's very well. But then it's as if he considers the dog as only his. One of Yeller's puppies was gonna be for Travis, but he didn't care so the puppy went for Arliss. Later, Travis apparently claims the puppy as only his. So, it's only the big brother who wins everything for him? What about the little brother? Nevertheless, these details don't interfere significantly in what is a fine movie. The soundtrack is dated but its charm remains intact. The wonderful settings of a very old Texas also help a lot to make this a great film.Title in Portugal 'O Rapaz e o Cão'.

No major stars, they had to use some stock footage of animals to pad it out but the end result is incredible. For a small little movie the impact it had on me exceeds most other movies despite their budgets being $100million+ more. The basic messages of the boy trying to be a man, the loyality of both the dog to the family and the boy to the dog remain very strong. In a video tape version I saw there was an interview with Tommy Kirk who said that they will still be watching this movie 100 years from now and he was dead on. In real life it's very rare to have someone stick by you in bad times and in my personal life I had a Rottweiler who I have no doubt would have given his life for me even though I wasn't exactly the best owner. The rarity of this quality makes the movie more special because the way it plays out you can believe it every step of the way. If you haven't seen it before it's something you should experience.

Jim Coates (Fess Parker) is heading up to Kansas on a cattle haul,  reluctantly yet confidently leaving wife Katie (Dorothy McGuire),  14 year old son Travis (Tommy Kirk) and 5 year old Arliss (Kevin Corcoran) behind on the homestead.  The family is mildly worried,  since their cabin is in the wilderness near San Antonio.  But with the unexpected appearance of a huge,  homely but very friendly yellow mongrel,  Katie seems relieved,  and Arliss is delighted to have a big companion to romp with.  Travis is disgusted,  and sees the dog as a thieving panhandler who will only bring undue trouble.  When the yeller dog saves Arliss from an angry mother bear who would've surely mauled him to death,  Travis changes his tune,  and from then on,  he and Old Yeller are inseparable.  The dog more than earns his keep,  helping with the cattle,  keeping critters from ruining the corn,  and proving himself a lifesaver over and over.  This is the kind of movie that kids can watch (even though there are severe doses of reality regarding life and death),  and that adults can enjoy.  In other words,  Old Yeller is NOT a purple dinasaur.  I've loved this movie since I was 10 years old.

Jim Coates was going on a cattle drive and leaving his eldest son Travis in charge. He promised to bring his son a horse when he returns. Wife Katie begins to miss him even before he leaves. Then that afternoon while Travis was plowing, a yellow dog came tearing through the fields and spooked the mule. Travis chased the dog out of the yard, thinking it was gone for good. But it wasn't. Travis' brother Arliss found the dog and became friends with it, but Travis still hated the dog's guts.        Life was going pretty good. Travis soon learns that the dog, Yeller, was a good fighter. He fought off a bear that nearly attacked Arliss as well as come raccoons who tried sneaking on the farm that night. Then one day, a man named Burn Sanderson rode up to the Coates' home, claiming Yeller was his so he was about to take it back with him when Arliss began chucking rocks at Sanderson and screaming that it was his dog. Sanderson decided to do some swapping he'd trade Yeller if Katie would cook him a big meal. She did and he did enjoy it, he was also as good as his word and Yeller became Arliss' dog again. Sanderson told Travis about hydrophobia (or rabies) in the area.       The next day while Travis tried rounding up some hogs, they attacked him and Yeller, luckily they weren't killed. They healed pretty good, but the following night Yeller got in a fight with a wolf, leaving Katie to believe Yeller now had hydrophobia and declared he must be shot, but Travis thought it a good idea to pen him up for a while to be sure. So they did, and Yeller seemed just fine the next couple weeks, however one night he began growling and snarling at Travis for no reason. Arliss went out to let Yeller out, luckily Katie stopped him just in time or Yeller would've attacked them all. That did it. Katie got the gun, but Travis wanted to do it since it was his dog. So he did, in a very heartbreaking scene. The next day, Jim returns from his cattle drive and they're a family again. They got a new dog one of Yeller's puppies.       What can I say? This was a pretty good Disney movie, although I think Katie was unfair to Arliss at times and why does Travis say Yeller was his dog? It was Arliss' as well! Wasn't it he who traded a big, woman cooked meal to Burn Sanderson for Yeller? Dorothy McGuire (who's recently passed away) plays Katie Coates, Fess Parker is Jim. Tommy Kirk is Travis and Kevin Corcoran is Arliss. Jeff York and Chuck Connors (both dead) are here too.

Here is an example of the rating system misfiring. It is one thing to chastise a restricted film for violence, but it is another to consider a film such as this family viewing. Parental guidance is suggested here for its final adult move. The plot regards a yellow dog bearing the title name that is befriended into a family that lives on a farm. This dog is heroic as it engages in combat with bulls, boars and bears but once the dog is inflicted with rabies we witness the disturbing finale. Unsuitable for children yet its message is still relevant on its move to adulthood. It is beautifully shot with wonderful wildlife footage. Director Robert Stevenson sets the film's mood but he seems to have no idea what audience should view this garbage. Among the cast only Tommy Kirk seems broad. He at first rejects Yeller until the dog becomes heroic. Kirk will unfortunately have to bullet the dog once rabies factor in. The rest of the cast is cardboard. Kevin Corcoran plays younger brother who discovers Yeller. Fess Parker as father is gone through most of the film. Dorothy Maguire as mother is pretty standard. The film is like life itself.

You know the one I'm talking about. But trust me, there is far more to the film than that. There is loss, love, loyalty, hope, fear, doubt, and trust.The premise is so simple that it has become part of cliché. When his dad goes away, a boy, despite some reservations, befriends a haggard-looking dog named Old Yeller, who ends up saving his family more than once. As time goes on, his bond grows for the animal, and so does the threat that he will lose it.Even if you somehow don't know the ending, you know where this is going. It's a typical, if well-done and tragic, 'Boy and His Dog Story.' This sort of movie has been around for centuries. It wasn't new then, and it certainly isn't new now. But it's not about whether it's new or not. People are so obsessed with new concepts instead of new characters and new ways and new combinations. A good story is a good story. It's really as simple as that.The 'boy' in this story is Travis, and the actor that plays him, Tommy Kirk, is alright. His delivery is stilted but his facial expressions are well-done; all in all and considering his age, I'd say he's 'good.' The mother is excellent, and not just in comparison to the child actors; she really is played well. The rest of the cast is fine.There is one character who annoys me to no end, though through no fault of his child actor. The little brother... I'm sorry, I can't stand him. He's not even cute-annoying in the way that a real little boy is. He's just written to have no redeeming qualities, and you're supposed to not harp on him because he's just a little kid, and I'm not gonna let that slide.Thankfully, he's not in the movie that long, so he doesn't ruin it for me. Neither do the accents and lingo, which seem awfully forced and played up, but are forgivable. The main reason this film doesn't get full marks from me is because I wasn't invested in the characters- I felt for them, but only because they were in a good and well-crafted situation. They themselves do not interest me a bit.Still, it's a good film, and I can certainly see why so many people love it and why it has lasted this long. The parts of it that work really work. 'That scene' is one of the saddest and most emotional of any 50s movie, and easily the best part of the film. I love how they build it up, and how it (the scene!) is shot. The whole 70 minutes you've already watched flash before your eyes.That scene, as well as every other in the film, is well built up. The writing is tight here. Nothing is extraneous or overdone. It is only an 83 minute film after all. In fact, I might have preferred a few more character scenes. But tight is tight, and I'm not gonna argue with that.This is a fifties film through-and-through. I think how transparent it is stops the cheesiness from seeping through (the decade was a cheesy one for film).Enjoy. There are a lot worse ways to spend an hour and a half.

Just about any and every kid in the Neighborhood would make their almost obligatory pilgrimage to see it. There are, of course, reasons for such behaviour. First of all, a Disney Picture, any one, was always considered to be superior fare for families and children's viewing. That they have such fine reputation is underscored by some high fallutin' big shot educators, pseudo intellectuals and Family journals; who habitually would make their film recommendations perpetually including Disney, probably by a ten to one to any other company's product.THAT'S not to say that old Father Figure Walt didn't bring us a Lion's share of fine Cinematic memory; for he surely did do that thing. As a matter of fact, it is most proper to say that the Disney Misfire was the truly rare occurrence; and that goes for both Live Action and the Animated Full Length Features.IN the picture, Mr. Disney brought us the screen version of a highly awarded novel, which once again, was an Award Winner as a child oriented book. In OLD YELLER (Walt Disney Productions/Buena Vista Releasing Company, 1957), Disney & Company certainly topped any expectations that they may have had.PRESENTING, IN A NUTSHELL, OUR STORY&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;. It is in West Texas Cattle Ranching Country, in the Post Civil War period that we find ourselves transported. There is a tough decision to be made at the Coates Spread. Papa Coates (Fess Parker) is preparing to leave the Ranch for a Spell kin order to earn some needed extra cash for the family. Doing this would leave the family alone. The family included the Mother, Katie Coates (Dorothy McGuire) and sons Travis (Tommy Kirk) and the younger Arliss (old 'Moochie' himself, Kevin Corcoran).* After painful deliberation, they decide to do it; with Pappy telling Travis that he would be the acting Man of the House while the Dad was off with the Cattle Drive.DURING the absence of the Senior Mr. Coates, there are several interesting occurrences; but none more far-reaching and dramatically predisposed as the arrival on the Coates Family Ranch of a stray, old (not a pup) Yellow Dog. The canine is an instant hit with young Arliss but older bro Travis is less than enthusiastic about the doggie's presence there. Travis even attempts to give Yeller enough rope to hang himself! Ironically, Travis comes around to love the mongrel and indeed is asked to have love enough for Yeller to make things easy for him in the end. (Anybody recollect THE YEARLING (MGM, 1946.)).PAPPY returns and everything is all right. The boys even have the pick of the neighbor's dog's litter without even demanding a stud fee; as Old Yeller was the father of the brood (Right, Maury? You know, the DNA test.).THIS turn of events corresponded to the events of the Novels Old Yeller and Savage Sam; as well as being the set-up for a sequel film SAVAGE SAM (Walt Disney/Buena Vista, 1963). But of course good buddy Schultz, that is another story.THERE are a couple of our favourite scenes that occur in OLD YELLER; with the first being a confrontation between Arliss (Moochie) and Cowboy Burn Sanderson (Chuck Connors) over the ownership of Yeller. It turns out that Yeller was the property of the Cowboy; but little Arliss negotiated a deal that the vagabond saddle tramp couldn't refuse. As for the price of consummating the legal transference of clear title to the Dog, the Coates family would treat Sanderson to a home cooked dinner. This was additional to Arliss' offer of his pet horned as a tool of barter. It is a beautiful and amusing scene which contrasts the great difference between the boy and the man by use of high and low camera angles.THE other scene has Mother (Dorothy McGuire) telling Travis that the family is need of meat and directing him to go to the woods with rifle in hand to bring back venison. Once at the forest's edge, the boy situates himself in a tree and quietly waits for a deer to pass by. Suddenly a couple of deer emerge and Travis takes careful aim; but holds fire when his clear view revealed them to be a Doe and Fawn. (That's a Mother and Child Deer, Schultz!). Travis then displays delight in watching the deer play (no antelope present). He almost misses the sight of a lone Buck (Male); but he brings down the hammer, providing the family with the need meat.IT is a scene which the story could have well done without; yet it said so much. The sequence relays the great pleasure of just viewing and appreciating the beauty and wonder of Nature. At the same time, the humane and necessary use of the killing of both game and domestic livestock is underscored. It's subtle and very beautiful.IN many respects, the plot line and the main crisis of the story is much like the highly acclaimed and Technicolor visual spectacle THE YEARLING (MGM, 1946); albeit sans any pretensions that seem to be present in the latter film.NOTE * No Schultz, the name's Kevin Corcoran; not Steve Cochran!

Same sort of emotions, same sort of settings and same sort of main characters.Just like Shane, this movie also concentrates on issues such as family values. It also has some wonderful different written emotions and character development in it, such as the oldest boy taking his first steps into the progress of becoming a man, when he is left to take care of the family ranch. During this progress he is being helped by the inspiring and loyal dog Old Yeller. So in that regard Old Yeller isn't 'just' a family drama, it's also a coming of age movie.In essence, Old Yeller is a children's movie, after all it's a 'Disney'. But its also a movie that always has been great to watch by adults. It's a story for all ages, that never becomes too childish for adults and never too adult for children.The approach of letting a dog be the central character of the movie might sound odd and childish but it works fine for the story. It even makes some of the emotions and drama all the more powerful. The movie is of course best known for its emotional twist in the end, that basically everybody knows, even those who have never seen this movie.There is quite a lot happening in the story and despite its emotional heavy subjects, the movie never becomes too sappy. It also helps to keep the movie realistic, which certainly also strengthens some of the drama.The movie is good looking and set in a nice looking environment. It makes the atmosphere of the movie, which is old fashioned but warm.It's obvious that the acting isn't the best thing about the movie. The movie is filled with a whole bunch of actors that you'll probably have never heard off. They're at times weak and at other quite solid. In other words, some really varying acting. It's definitely true that Tommy Kirk's character grows in the movie. It's quite a tough and responsible role for a boy of his age but he handles it really well. Chuck Connors also makes a pretty good appearance in the movie. Kevin Corcoran was mostly irritating as the younger always nagging little brother. Of course the animal acting was also really great.As far as children movies are concerned, this one is about as good as they can get.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"classic, heart-warming children's story","Date":"25 February 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Drama, Adventure","Review":" 'Old Yeller' is a children's film about a family in the wild west of America who find a yellow dog.

Sure, most everybody can identify and get involved of the tale about a boy and his dog, but the filmmakers and script-writers have to be conscious enough about what they are doing to pull it off. Old Yeller is not a movie that bends down on its knees and pleads for you to like it. It just plays it straight and sweetly and gets the exact effect it wants out of you.In the movie, young but world-conscious Travis Coates (Tommy Kirk) is sad about the passing-away of his previous dog and unwillingly comes upon another companion when a golden retriever comes a-bounding into his life. Travis is initially skeptical of this dog, but is forced to adapt to him when his younger brother wants to adopt him. However, as time goes on, Travis himself becomes more and more attached to the retriever than his brother. And he forms not merely a friendship, but a partnership with this lovable canine, whom he names Old Yeller.There have been many boy-and-dog (or substitute dog for any other animal) stories over the years, trying to be Old Yeller. Some have accomplished it like that wonderful 2000 movie My Dog Skip. But this incredibly sentimental and heart-warming tale has immortalized itself with its ways of getting the audience involved. I'd be even as daring to say that people who did not growing up with a dog will be undoubtedly moved by this story unless they are a moral-devoid curmudgeon. I won't give away the ending of the movie because of the Internet Movie Database's guidelines, even though I think we all know the way this movie culminates. There's a saying going around that if you did not cry at the end of Old Yeller you are either hopelessly lacking a heart or a lousy hypocrite. I mean, how can your heartstrings not be pulled at by the way this movie culminates? Please keep in mind that this review is coming from a 19-year-old college student who re-watched the movie in his early years as an adult, not somebody simply reminiscing about cinema experiences of the past.Old Yeller aims for sympathy and it gets it. But it does not overplay its motives and storytelling techniques to the point where it becomes schmaltzy and unpleasantly over-sweet. From my personal experience, after having watched Old Yeller for the first time since sixth grade, I wanted nothing more than to walk up to my own dog and embrace him lovingly, which I did. Some movies are influential because of a revolutionary factor. Pictures like this work because they tread upon familiar ground, but do it right. Old Yeller is one of the best doggone dog movies in the West, East, North, and South. It's a wonderful little tale.

Simplicity is what it is all about, as well as expert dog training. Yet, the result is pretty good film-making. The movie is mostly a dramatic and sentimental story (with a particularly harsh ending).It is filmed in completely natural settings. It's all pure, natural and old fashioned in a story that takes place in Texas. The mutt Yeller is adorable and a pretty yeller dog, like Arliss says. He seems to be more of a Labrador Retriever - not a pure one but a mixed breed. In fact, Spike, the dog that portrays this character, was just like old Yeller (according to Kevin Corcoran and Tommy Kirk) lovable, sweet, friendly, intelligent, easy to be trained... and a great actor. He even moves his head with an inquisitive expression when they talk about him in the movie, as if he understands what they're saying.The human characters are generally likable, being Burn Sanderson one of my favorites. As for Bud Searcy, he is clearly a joke. The main joke is that he always acts as if he's gonna help in something and then he tells his daughter to do it. Yep, he is lazy... and talkative and a bit boring.Old Yeller is from the same generation as the popular TV series Lassie. In fact, many influences from Lassie (as well as inspiration) can be seen here. Just look at the general pure nature environment of it (forests, green places, mountains, rivers) and the boy/dog story. Not to mention that Travis resembles the boy from Lassie. These similarities can't be just coincidence.The actors are all good and natural in their roles. Tommy Kirk is terrific. He was one of the great Disney talents, like a later-day Bobby Driscoll. Very convincing in his performances and talented. It's a shame how Disney threw away actors like Bobby Driscoll and Tommy Kirk, two fine actors who did so much for Disney and later fired for stupid reasons. Disney lost two unparalleled talents by doing this...This should definitely be on Top 250.

Although it may be aimed at kids, it doesn't talk down to them, and the lesson it delivers (about learning to take responsibility as you grow up) makes no concession to the probable age of the audience, and is the more powerful for that.Yet it also tells us that death is a natural part of life, and that life goes on. These, too, are important lessons for us all, and this film makes these points with a complete absence of preachiness.Tommy Kirk is superb in this film.The single flaw is Kevin Corcoran who, as usual, is a complete pain in the seat of the trousers. I think the people at Disney must have thought he was funny, or he was there for audience identification or something. He was a total irritant when I saw this as a child and he remains a total irritant as I plunge headlong into my autumn years.Don't let that put you off the movie, though!

Old Yeller got his name from the color of his fur. A playful and trouble making dog. The type of dog you'd want to have as a kid.Old Yeller isn't too depressing to watch. well you might have a different option on this movie.Due to the fact that this movie is an Innocent family movie. Not too much violence, and little amount of blood. As well as a good use of trained animals for this movie.I suggest renting it or borrowing it first before thinking of buying it.

Based on the novel by Fred Gipson, Old Yeller is set in Texas in 1869. While his father is away on a cattle drive, 15-year-old Travis Coates takes over management of the family farm. Adopting a strictly business policy, Travis is irritated when younger brother, Arliss, adopts a frisky stray dog. Soon Travis is as fond of the dog as everyone else in the family is; moreover, Old Yeller is an excellent watchdog. However, while fighting off a mad wolf, Yeller is infected with rabies. Though Yeller seems unaffected at first, he eventually behaves so viciously that the disheartened Travis has no choice but to **** *** ***. A heart-to-heart talk between Travis and his returning father coupled with the adoption of a new pup, paves the way to an emotional but reasonably happy ending. Earning eight million dollars domestically on its first release, Old Yeller convinced Walt Disney to devote more and more time to live-action films and less time to animation, which at the time was a great business move. In 1963, Disney released a lesser sequel to Old Yeller titled Savage Sam. I was wasn't that crazy about this picture either. To me once the dog got in the fight the movie was over. I give this movie four-weasel stars because there was not much drama or action in this movie other then the fight with the wolf.

The story set in the post civil war frontier where the father has gone on a cattle drive leaving his two young sons with their mom. It is about a yellow dog that a young lad Arliss has found and become attached with. His older brother Travis cannot stand it as he is being attacking other animals in the farm.However Travis realises that Yeller is a loyal and brave fighter as he fought off a bear that seem to have gone for Arliss. Both boys become attached with the dog and when the real owner comes looking for him Arliss persuades him to let Yeller stay with the family.The sad part is when Yeller fights with some wolves he contracts rabies and becomes dangerous which means the family has to take drastic action.The film is a bittersweet and slightly sentimental story more famous for its tragic ending which the little ones found upsetting at the time. I actually found the story rather light, Yeller is energetic, brave and mischievous. I liked the young actor who played Arliss but I am not sure that it stands up well with a modern audience today.

I think it was late last summer when I first watched this adaptation of the Old Yeller novel by Fred Gipson, and from what I remember, I was impressed with a lot of it, but later on, I wasn't so sure anymore. I watched The Shaggy Dog, another live action Disney dog movie from the 50's featuring Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran playing brothers, for the first time just this week. Shortly after watching that film and being fairly impressed with it, I have watched Old Yeller for the second time, and would say it was better for me than it was the first time, and also better than the other Disney dog movie I've mentioned, which I was expecting.In 1860's Texas, Jim Coates leaves his ranch to take part in a cattle drive, and won't be back for several months. On the ranch, he leaves behind his wife, Katie, and two sons Travis and Arliss. Travis, the older of the two brothers, is left to take his father's responsibilities. Shortly after his father leaves, Travis happens to be working outside when a stray yellow dog comes, scares the family mule, and makes it knock down the fence! Travis angrily chases this dog away, but the next day, he finds him back on the ranch already! Arliss has decided to adopt this dog, but after the trouble the mutt has already caused, Travis obviously doesn't want him around. However, the older Coates brother begins to have a change of heart when he discovers that the meat he left out overnight has surprisingly not been touched by the dog. It soon turns out that Old Yeller is a big help for Travis as he takes on the responsibilities of his absent father, and the two develop a strong bond, but there is some trouble ahead.This movie has a small cast, but most of the few who had roles in it put on decent performances, even if some are slightly flawed. Dorothy McGuire and Fess Parker as the Coates parents, Tommy Kirk as Travis (one of his many Disney roles), and actor/athlete Chuck Connors in the smaller role of Burn Sanderson, are all notable cast performances. On the other hand, I did not care much for Jeff York as the lazy, fast-talking Bud Searcy, or Beverly Washburn as Bud's daughter, Lisbeth, and when these two characters first appear, I've found that they may temporarily bring the entertainment value down a bit, but fortunately, they aren't usually a problem. For the most part, the plot is an intriguing one, with what Travis and Old Yeller go through together and the boy's initial reaction to the dog followed by the strong bond they develop. Obviously, SO many others have pointed this out, but parts of the film certainly are emotional as well, which also helps keep it from being underwhelming and forgettable. They also picked some nice, scenic filming locations for this particular live action Disney film.I'm sure many people through the generations have seen this movie in their childhood, but I didn't, so I obviously don't know what that's like. This certainly isn't the happiest movie a kid could watch, but its reputation shows that it clearly has pleased many of those who saw it as kids, so I guess it has succeeded with that goal as the decades have gone by, and likely continues to do so today. Many adults like this Old Yeller adaptation as well, which I can understand after seeing it myself. In my opinion, there are some weaker parts of the film, so I can't rate it as highly as some voters, but overall, it's a solid effort that has aged well. If you haven't seen this successful 1957 Disney animal movie, I will say that should you do decide to watch it, some parts could make you cry if you're an emotional kind of person, or maybe even if you're not that emotional (though I didn't cry), but this is a major reason why it's so widely remembered and praised.

Young Kirk is to watch over the ranch, with mother Dorothy McGuire (as Katie), and little brother Kevin Corcoran (as Arliss). While tending the corn field, a wayward dog causes Kirk trouble, scaring a mule and ruining Kirk's day. Kirk has no use for Old Yeller, but brother Corcoran loves the ugly, lop-eared mongrel. The dog stays in the picture, but for how long? A classic family story. Kirk and Yeller make terrible first impressions on each other. Kirk does not like Old Yeller. He tries to manage the dog as he thinks an adult would, and recalls an older family pet as irreplaceable. Yeller is not fooled by Kirk's growing pains, and the two become hopelessly bonded. Eventually, the story becomes almost... Shakespearian. Robert Stevenson directed, with a great Disney production team. Credit must be given to Fred Gipson and William Tunberg's mature screenplay - and, especially to Kirk, who performs his part superbly.All things being equal, Kirk should have received some Best Actor award notices for his role in Old Yeller. It's difficult to imagine this film working without his sincere, captivating performance. Little Corcoran has more typical Disney role; his scenes with Kirk (discussing Heaven) and Chuck Connors are nicely done. Try to ignore the garish Indian headdress. Young Beverly Washburn (as Lisbeth Searcy) plays her puppy love for Kirk just right. Ms. McGuire and father Fess Parker (as Jim) are realistic, loving, and supportive. Old Yeller is, truly, the best doggone dog in the west. ********* Old Yeller (12/25/57) Robert Stevenson ~ Tommy Kirk, Dorothy McGuire, Kevin Corcoran, Fess Parker "},{"Title":"Dated but enjoyable","Date":"19 September 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Drama, Adventure","Review":" I saw this movie when I was a boy and again recently in my 30s. I have to admit that the movie, in many ways, does not stand the test of time. It looks very dated - there is no flashy cgi here. The script is old-fashioned and teaches morals that are not considered cool any more.A stray dog wanders onto a farm. The boy who lives there adopts him and they have several adventures together. A tight knit bond is formed and the boy matures into manhood at the end of the film.There isn't much here for parents, the story offers no adult sub-plot. For a young boy however, this movie remains a classic. This is the best of the Disney live-action films of its era.

In fact, the country group Confederate Railroad even sang a song where they lament that they should have KNOWN a woman was no good because 'she didn't cry when Old Yeller died'...and I guess they wouldn't think much of me, either! I did NOT particularly enjoy Old Yeller for one very important reason--this Labrador was probably the meanest dog I've ever seen on film! It loved fighting with other animals and when Yeller got rabies and needed to be put down, it was the result of him attacking yet another animal! So, although Disney desperately wanted me to cry along with Yeller's owner at his passing, I just thought it was a blessing! If you DO want to see a film about a boy and his animal, may I suggest a different Disney film? I just saw So Dear to My Heart and loved it. It's about a young boy who raises a lamb--and the film is sweet throughout. In fact, this film debuted about a decade BEFORE Old Yeller and this later film is an obvious copy. See this other film--you'll see that it's dandy entertainment throughout...and the animal isn't a nasty killing machine!

A man (Fess Parker--second billed but hardly in the movie) has to leave his family for a while for a job (or something). He leaves behind wife Katie (Dorothy McGuire), teenage son Travis (Tommy Kirk) and extremely annoying child Arliss (Kevin Corcoran). A beautiful stray yellow dog is adopted by the family. Travis hates it at first but learns to love it. Then it gets dark and depressing only to end happily ever after (this is a Disney film after all).**DEFINITE SPOILERS** OK--it's great to look at it--there's some really beautiful color photography here. There's lots of episodes with cute little animals--baby deers, a baby bear, rabbits, raccoons etc etc. Usually I hate stuff like that but this really was so cute! McGuire has the thankless saintly mother role but pulls it off giving an excellent performance. Old Yeller himself is also the most beautiful dog. But this movie has problems--BIG ones! There's the title tune which almost had me turning this off--so annoying! Then there's Kirk and Corcoran. Kirk is bad but Corcoran is incredibly annoying. He's the most obnoxious brat I've ever seen in a movie! More than once I wanted Travis or Katie to slap him silly. At the end when Travis has to shoot Old Yeller I was hoping he'd shot Arliss too! Also the ending--I heard this makes people cry. Usually I break down at anything but I was dry-eyed during this. The lousy acting by Kirk probably was the reason. Also the end was so unrealistically happy I started laughing!Also two troubling things--the implication in this is that a boy becomes a man after he shoots his loving dog. That's pretty scary. Also McGuire is THRILLED when her husband brings her home a dress and shoes!!!! She should have told him off for abandoning the kids and her! Still, for 1957, that was considered OK. So kids will probably go for this. I'm giving this a 7 for the color and the animals.

The characters created in the book were destroyed as they were turned into unconvincing snobs by these down-right terrible actors.I wasn't convinced at all that any people in the movie were actually in old-western times (and Arliss's squeaky accent didn't help with the illusion).I wouldn't bother watching if I wasn't an adult who was already convinced that Old Yeller is a classic.
