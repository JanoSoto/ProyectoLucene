Maybe there's a bit of nostalgia in my comments, but I appreciate this movie's approach to faith. God comes in a form that our modern society seems to enjoy dismissing-- the elderly. It's a delight to George Burns, who really does have all that mileage on him, and John Denver, whom no one will mistake for Laurence Olivier, create this relationship between the mundane and the spiritual that is relatable, relaxed and relevant. In our culture, we already know about the forbidding and the punishing, and the hostility between faiths. But here's a God who says, paraphrasing here, Jesus was my son. Moses was my son. Mohammed was my son. Buddah was my son. And so are you. And so is the guy who's charging you 18.50 for a piece of room service roast beef.Inclusive, with gentle humor. Burns' performance suggests a being who has seen a lot of the world, and doesn't expect anything of importance to happen quickly. It's a loving and practical relationship between the everyday and the sacred.And the old hands, Barnard Hughes and Paul Sorvino, and the whole gang of great character actors, make this a treat to watch. And gee, having Teri Garr play exasperated. That's like asking Pavarotti if maybe he'd like to sing something.Maybe a bit sweet for your taste, I don't know. For me, I can actually watch it whenever it comes on and enjoy every moment of it.

I do like the fact that he is represented as less than perfect; he shows us the human side of our creator. John Denver is great as the grocery clerk, the naive, put-upon modern Moses who tries to convince everyone that he's not insane.The appeal of this film is the underlying message that God cares for us, and also the way the message is delivered in such a non-denominational, non-preachy, non-judgmental manner. Its a fun movie that reminds us that God is always watching us---not to squash us like a bug when we make a mistake, but to be there for us when we need him.The movie appeals to all ages. 10/10 stars.

I am sure there are many growing up now, whole hosts of people, who have yet to discover this and I hope they do, particularly those who are fans of Bruce Almighty and are not aware of this wonderful movie from the 70's.

The director, Carl Reiner, points to an eight-minute scene in which it is just Denver and Burns talking in a bathroom.  There is no music, no fast cuts, no special effects, and the scene simply holds our attention on its own.  Mr. Reiner indicates that there is no way that the scene would be made that way today.Some scenes are timeless, such as Jerry's first encounter with the Almighty via intercom in the all-white room.  Also classic is the infamous scene in the bathroom in which God first reveals himself in the flesh to a humbled and still somewhat disbelieving John Denver.Unfortunately, not all of the movie holds up as well.  Some things, especially exteriors, seem very dated.  And even though it is quaint, it is hard to believe that an intelligent and capable husband and wife team would cherish a Supermarket Assistant Manager Job so much.  Ah well, it was another time when people still believed in sticking with one company and working their way up through the ranks.I wish that the film would explore some of the harder questions of religion a little more seriously, but one wonders if the film would collapse if taken out of its sweet, feel-good movie formula in which it is helplessly trapped forever.If anything, rent it for the performances of the two leads.  George Burns, playing the role at 83, is so good, that it is, (not to be cliched,) awesome.  However, what is equally as unbelievable is the performance of John Denver in his first and only acting gig.  He hits some of his notes perfectly, and it really shows a significant skill and timing to play straight man to a legend like Burns.

While Bruce Almighty has some funny moments, I think this one is far superior.First of all, George Burns is amazing. Morgan Freeman's God in Bruce Almighty had a slightly ominous, don't-cross-me nature, but Burns' is a God you can completely trust. He is caring and optimistic, and wants the world to get better. He doesn't throw Jerry into a situation he can't handle; he is there for him the whole time. Plus he is just a really fun guy to be around. Who wouldn't want to believe in a God like that?John Denver also does a great job. It is hard to believe he had no acting experience before this, because he is top-notch. He is a kind, honest guy, not a selfish jerk like Jim Carrey's Bruce Almighty. He is nervous about delivering God's message to the world, but perfectly willing to do it.Unlike that other God movie, this one delivers a good message without getting annoyingly preachy, it is consistently funny from start to finish, it has a likable main character, and it features a God who is a friend, not an opponent. I think everyone could enjoy watching this, whether they are religious or not.Oh, and on a completely irrelevant note, I think Carl Reiner's cameo (doing an impression of the portrait of Dorian Grey) is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. That scene alone is reason enough to watch this movie.8/10 stars.

A remake would fall flat on its face.The story is quasi-original.  The notion of a higher or supreme being asking one of us mortals to do his bidding is nothing new, but to place the gentle and warm spin on it, and to take that legend out of its biblical era context, and place it in (what was then) contemporary times, is really a stroke of genius.Burns plays a grandfatherly God who is concerned, though not wrathful.  This God is not Cecil B. DeMille's fire-and-brimstone God from The Ten Commandments.  Nor is Burns' God the detached entity that is less hands on than God's foes in The Exorcist or Omen series.  In Oh God we have a creator who wants to instill a little reassurement to Earthbound souls.  Burns' character is one with a need that must be fulfilled.  But Burns' God doesn't go about it by creating apocalyptic scenarios to threaten nor coax mankind into the task.  Instead this God approaches the problem with a more thoughtful plan.  Veteran Vaudevillian George Burns' does a superb job portraying the Almighty, and does so with sublime humor and grandfatherly frankness.Denver portrays an honest grocery store manager whose sole purpose is to satisfy his customers.  That is until George Burns beckons him hither.  What's even more amazing is the fact that, to the best of my knowledge anyway, Denver gives us an exceptionally convincing performance but with little professional experience.  The Jerry Landers character he portrays is honest, thoughtful, earnest and full of conviction.  Denver lets his own character shine in this performance.The real genius of this film is that the comedy is very sedate while still being funny.  The film doesn't try to be something more than what it already is.  A film with God as a character could've gone anywhere, but Reiner doesn't take too many liberties with the material at hand.  Instead he keeps film focused and even keeled, while tossing in good humorous bits to keep up the levity.  Even so, please be warned, the laughs are spaced out.  This is not a film filled with wall to wall gags.  Both humor and overall energy are kept low to drive home the storie's message.This is in comparison to a recent reincarnation of the God theme/film in Bruce Almighty, which has often been compared to Reiner's 1977 work by commentators on this website.  I finally saw Bruce Almighty recently, and where I found sections of it humorous it really didn't hold a candle to Oh God.  The theme was selfish, the character was selfish, the overall feel was typical 90's corporate art, with Jim Carry's absurdities thrown in for poor measure.  This is largely because Bruce Almighty is really a different film, with a different premise, and regrettably (though not unexpectedly) botches most of the affair.  Bruce Almighty satisfies a juvenile curiosity.  Oh God is a soothing uplift, and, by contrast, is the better film.Oh God doesn't have any direct and explicit sexual references, there're no body function jokes, nor obvious and readable plot points nor plot holes, unlike a good number of today's films.  There's no rap song at the end credits, nor cameo by some pop artist (other than Denver, who plays the lead), nor any product placement.  Nor is there even any CGI (though it may've benefited from one or two CGI shots).  Oh God a basic film with a timeless premise, and very simply message.See Oh God.  It's food for the soul.

However, he was nervous about playing it and consulted the greatest actors about how to do it. Let me explain this film, the two leads were one person (John Denver) who was well known as a singer but who had never acted before in his life and another (George) who at almost 80 had only one other acting credit (The Sunshine Boys). However, this unlikely duo made movie magic! It is a truly amazing accomplishment and a joy watching them together. This is a film that is as important today as it was when it came out almost a quarter of a century ago. We all need to realize God's love and his message and no one did a better job of giving that then George did in this wonderful film, especially in the end in the courtroom speech that he gives. This man had spent his life as just a comedian not as an actor, but he deserved another Oscar for his outstanding work in this wonderful film. Carl Reiner deserves kudos for his wonderful directing job and Terri Garr gives a great performance as the understanding wife as does Paul Sorvino as the corrupt evangilist (they picked a safe target). However, the cheers and handshakes belong to George Burns and John Denver alone!!!. They have both left us and we are the poorer for it, but I hope that both of them are having a wonderful time in Heaven!

It's not preachy, overly religious or anti-religious. It's more inspirational and shouldn't offend anyone.George Burns is terrific as God taking the form of a kind old man. God (Burns) asks a man (John Denver) in the 1970s to relay His message to the world that, despite the tough times, it can work if people get their act together. The man is put in the unenviable position of trying to convince people that he really is God's messenger. In the end, it's not about politics or who's right and who's wrong; it's a friendly reminder that we shape the world in which we live, and we can make it good again.Carl Reiner's film seems like a fairly realistic (if comical) portrayal of the difficulties that would arise if God appeared to only one man in today's modern society. There's a satirical side to it. But the God in this film isn't concerned with who believes and who doesn't. He realizes He can't win over everybody, but He remains in good humor. He watches over the universe in a hands-off manner.Personally I'm not very religious, but Burns is the kind of God I'd like.

This movie is one of them and I had not seen it in over a decade at the very least. I grew up seeing this movie on TV and have always liked everything about it. First thing would of course be it's overall message. That our world can work if we (the nations of the world and individuals who occupy them)learn to work together for the common cause. Not just the cause of world peace but of just simply getting along together and to stop taking the world we live in for granted. In the film George Burns,as God,sees the world he created being smothered by a brown cloud of pollution,his rivers & oceans being poisoned by either chemical dumping or by humans mis-using them as a toilet or trash can. He also talks about how people go around saying he never existed in the first place. (Note Believing in God has to come from undeniable,unyielding feeling of faith by an individual,which is part of free will.)That said,the second thing is the story of how God chooses Jerry (John Denver) as his modern day Moses by sending him an invitation in the mail. Casting him as the recipient of this task was a great move because John looks like someone you'd see on the street (if he hadn't been famous). Jerry's home and work and entire life are turned upside down by his declaration that he has seen and talked directly to God. Even people in religious organizations think he's a lunatic. Terri Garr is very effective as his loving but distressed wife who just wants her husband to stop it all and be the way he was.The sight gags are good in making us believe this really is God Jerry is speaking too. The 27th floor on a ten story building,God on the car radio & the rain in Jerry's (seen to be believed) Pacer and God's appearance,in coming to Jerry's aid,in the courtroom near the end of the movie. Pretty simple special effects but God most likely (as Burns said) doesn't need flash. This film doesn't either,it may be filmed in simple form but that's the idea here. The message is a simple but important one and you don't need a million dollar budget to send it out. Now here in 2007,kind of sad to say,this is still the exact same message we still need to hear. Basically,if anything,to remind ourselves how human we are and how easily it all could be gone. It may be set in 1977 and the Pacer car and fashions outdated but the story & message are timeless. I just hope one day,the message wont necessarily be needed.Ten stars for all of it(including the great extra of commentaries by Terri Garr,Lary Gelbart & Carl Reiner.

This is probably the best of the Carl Reiner directed films of his that I've seen. I never saw The comic or Where's Poppa but his four comedies that stared Steve Martin were forgettable. Martin alone saved them from being total loses. I've seen glimpses of Reiner's other films on television before I switched channels but Oh God has a great cast and some great writing from Larry Gelbart. Gelbart of course is legendary as a writer and developer coming from Sid Ceasars Show of Shows in the 50's, writing A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and Tootsie and the television series M*A*S*H. This screenplay is adapted from the novel by Avery Corman who also wrote Kramer vs. Kramer, earned Gelbart an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Adaptation. John Denver stars as a supermarket manager who is visited by God to spread the word that things can work for mankind on earth. God is played by George Burns who appears to Denver in the form of a casually dressed old man, kind of like George Burns on vacation. Burns while not being quite old enough to actually be God comes close enough. In the large supporting cast are a great ensemble of actors in Teri Garr, Ralph Bellamy, Paul Sorvino, Barnard Hughes, Barry Sullivan, Donald Pleasence, Dinah Shore, David Ogden Stiers and William Daniels. An interesting group of actors where the careers of some were on their way up while others were on their way down. Denver himself, though remaining a recording artist never had another role this big on film and would in fact over the next 20 years only make two more theatrical films and four made-for-TV movies. Victor J. Kemper is the film's cinematographer. He was hot property in the 70's with his work on the film's The Hospital, They Might Be Giants, The Candidate, The Eyes of Laura Mars, Magic, Dog Day Afternoon and Oh God. He would never again match on film the success he enjoyed in that decade. This is a good movie and worth a look and I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.

(comedy, 1977) Jerry (John Denver) is an assistant-manager for a produce store. He's a happy family man until God (George Burns) requests an audience. He has picked Jerry to carry his message of good will to an increasingly pessimistic world. But Jerry finds that people are difficult to convince, he even has trouble trying to make his family understand that God appears to him as a kindly old man.Critique A surprise box-office hit when first released, it spawned other sequels that proved interesting ('OH! GOD! BOOK 2', 'OH! GOD! YOU DEVIL'). 81 year old George Burns shines as the perennial God, a role that he played with sweet abandonment. He is given great lines to work with. This God seems to have an answer for everything on creating the world he quips; to tell you the truth I thought about it for 6 days and did the whole thing in 1. What's most interesting is that the film takes an unbiased, non-religious look at our Creator. This God doesn't believe in religions or its leaders, and sees human suffering as being our fault (not His doing) since we 'choose' to be. No wonder the very simple themes and in-jokes appealed to so many.QUOTE Jerry Sometimes, now and then, couldn't we just talk? God Tell you what, you talk I'll listen.

The movie dances about the difficulties often doing a pirouette. Truly, Burns is great here, this is a consistently witty movie having lots of fun with televangelists. Sorvino steals the movie as a crooked, greedy television evangelist whom Burns' God tells Jerry to tell to get a real job, maybe selling earth shoes but shut up. I understand people of specific religions being put off by the film, but, truthfully notice Burns' does not deny a Day Of Judgment,If you mean a doomsday, there is going to be a lot of yelling and screaming and I don't need that any more than you do. The movie follows God choosing a lowly grocery assistant manager to be His next messenger. The movie's Theism is intended to transcend the gulfs between all particular religions. This is the point of God telling Landers that He is not into religion; He is bigger than that, He is everyone's God. The movie follows the perils of Landers trying to bring his message to people with realistic consequences like losing his job, becoming a pariah and being perceived as a raving lunatic. It is unrelentingly endearing with Landers presenting God's card to people never grasping how bizarre it is to others.The movie starts light, maintains its lightness until the end, where it grows more serious with Lander's facing jail for slandering Sorvino's crooked money bags evangelist. The message of God's love is here, yes detractors, the cost of Goodness is attenuated to keep the movie's tone light. Even on this point, notice the suffering Landers and his family undergo. His Faith is attacked, he is fired, ostracized and ridiculed but he remains true to God. Burns never gave a better performance, the writing features great trenchant dialog poking fun at those who think, because they are giving the invocation at the Super Bowl, they stand above all others. Yes, it will offend Christians, as it did in 1977. My parents were picketing this for the line,Jesus was my son, Muhammad was my son, Moses was my son&#x85;, no, it is important not to miss the movie's highlighting the commonalities of all religions. The love of each other, Faith that courageously defies, sacrifice for one's Faith these are all here but done lightly. Denver, a great singer but an average actor, is carried in most of his scenes by much more talented actors Burns, Sorvino, Garr and Hughes. I am a Theist, a Theistic Existentialist to be precise, it conveys the core ideas of Theism well and comically. Yes, if you believe that one particular religion is correct and all others are Evil, do not watch the movie, it will offend you. When you watch it over notice how, though moral duties are lightened, Jerry's sufferings for his Faith are not. The suspense of the movie builds to his almost incarceration with God saving Jerry at the last minute. Encouraging people to think about God is never a bad thing, though it is admittedly humanistic in this,you're on your own, I gave you everything you need, no movie is perfect. It is funny while making its point; this is the movie that put Sorvino on the map. For me, the points about the costs of Faith, the separation of hypocrisy, as a refutation of the verity of spirituality, make this worth owning. The whole point of the Sorvino story and God's disgust with him is to show you a pithy refutation of Neil Jordan's The Borgias. See, if every single pope were Evil and corrupt, you have not touched one moral law. Morality does not rise or fall predicated upon perfect practitioners. To be human is to be corrupt, morality is not refuted by showing its adherents being flawed, take some logic Neil!The spirituality, while light, is still of substance. It is all done with wit and humor as only George Burns could do it. Sit down sonny, I've answered enough questions. It was released before Star Wars and was drowned beneath that tsunami at the box office. Also, many people, like my parents, took great umbrage at it. It truly is a witty presentation of Theism The theory that God is beyond all human attempts to confine Him in a single religion. It will make you chuckle, guaranteed.

Not that this was what God looked like, of course. God explained that this was just the way he chose to appear to Jerry Landers (played by John Denver) - the Tarzana, California supermarket assistant manager through whom God chose to speak a word to the world. God couldn't appear as he really was, it was explained, because Landers (and presumably the rest of us) just couldn't handle that. Point taken. That actually reminded me a bit of John's Gospel, in speaking of Jesus no one has ever seen God, but God the one and only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.This is a very low-key movie for the most part about God choosing to make an appearance basically to plead - through Jerry - for people to start getting along with each other and to stop hurting each other; an appeal to set aside all the things that divide us and start to focus on being the human family. Not a bad message - but, as the film portrays, a message not received well at all. Instead of embracing the message, those who heard it chose to either attack or ridicule the messenger - surely a warning for those who claim to bring a word from God. Through Burns, God isn't portrayed as a being of great power, breathing fire and brimstone and anxiously waiting to bring judgement upon us. God is frustrated with us, disappointed in us, amused by us, but not especially angry. It's hard to imagine God as portrayed here being angry.The movie breaks out of its low key feel very briefly for a scene involving the Reverend Willie Williams (played by Paul Sorvino.) One of a panel of religious experts called upon to pass judgement on whether or not Jerry's experience of God was real, Sorvino's portrayal of Williams - a corrupt and greedy evangelist - was very well done; a spark of real energy in an otherwise sedate movie. Williams and the others on the panel, of course, are all convinced that God would only speak through them (or at least through their various religions) and not through a lowly supermarket assistant manager. But God chose the humble and unknown Jerry. There's a theological point being made there - an important one actually, and such theological points are made throughout the movie, although never in a hard-sell, in your face sort of way. Teri Garr (who seems to me to have been everywhere in the 70's) was also cast in this as Jerry's devoted but doubtful wife.Some compare this movie to Bruce Almighty. It actually has more in common I think with Evan Almighty - the idea of God choosing a person to speak through and having him rejected as either insane or a fraud. Jerry wasn't given God's powers, after all - just a message for the world. Low key and sedate, this movie won't get your heart pounding or cause outrageous laughter. It's just gently thought- provoking and mildly amusing. A pleasant viewing experience.

Now rather than risk spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a delightful, little comedy which is clearly not meant to be taken too seriously. Certainly, having God appear as an old man with glasses and a baseball hat was definitely amusing. Likewise, I thought Teri Garr (as Jerry's wife Bobbie) was also a good addition as well as she was absolutely gorgeous. In any case, although this wasn't a roll-in-the-aisle type of comedy it was good enough for the time spent and I rate it as slightly above average. "},{"Title":"Trust me.

Most have some warm or inspiring words about the picture so I think the movie succeeded on that level.Realizing that many people growing up are fed a doctrine of God being all powerful and vengeful over one's transgressions, it's comforting to see a picture where the Supreme Being is portrayed as just an ordinary human. The series of books by Neale Donald Walsch - Conversations With God - takes a similar approach and I find this humanistic attitude to be rather appealing. Who wants a God that will strike you down every time you do the slightest thing wrong? At eighty one years old, I think George Burns had the God gig down pat. Very cordial and conversational, he was able to make his spiritual pitch in a manner that wasn't threatening and was even quite inspirational and uplifting. The ideas he expressed were so steeped in common sense that virtually no one could find fault, no matter what denomination one follows. It was best summed up by God himself - I gave you a world and everything in it. It's all up to you.Certainly there are those who question how or why a loving God would allow suffering and pain in the world, and God's answer touched on the one important point most people overlook - the entire concept of free will. Without it, decision making is taken away from humans, and therefore choices are impossible. I was glad the movie illustrated this point brilliantly with the conversation between God and Jerry Landers (John Denver).With a great message, I think this is a wonderful film for the whole family to enjoy. It puts spiritual snake oil salesmen like Reverend Willie Williams (Paul Sorvino) in their place, and invites the viewer to reconsider one's own relationship with the Almighty.

And, surprising as it may be to some of these Hollywod Big Shots, the movie is eminently successful and even critically acclaimed.WHEN WE LOOK for examples of such films, we are inundated with many. Just imagine when we all saw titles like ROCKY, MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING and the all time underdog of kiddie films, BENJI. Inspite of all of the conventional wisdom from entertainment world sharpies, films like these do, somehow, get made. CONCERNING THE CIORCUMSTANCES leading up to the exhibiting of a film such as this OH GOD (Warner Bros./1977), it in itself, is certainly a Celluloid Miracle.THE DEPICTION OF anyone who is so Middle Class or even Blue Collar as to attend Church, Synagogue, Temple or Mosque regularly is considered to be too outdated and 'corny' for so many Hollywood money men. Hedonism, epicurean-ism, greed and narcissism are considered to be the norm and are all too often glorified. IN SHARP CONTRAST, this little, inexpensive and family oriented film scores big number$ at the Box Office$ receipt$; which is, of course, a main objective in any studio. (Afyter all, it is a business!)OUR STORY Grocery Store Manager, Jerry Landers finds the rat race of everyday life to be just to much. Being frustrated at every turn, he finds himself automatically saying or shouting, Oh, God! After some time, he has an experience where an elderly man (Geotrge Burns) appears to him. He tells Jerry that he is indeed who Jerry has been summoning for so long, being God, Himself!AS WE WOULD expect, Jerry's natural tendency toward skepticism wins out as we find ourselves bearing witness to a multitude of embarrassing and very funny situations. The gag situations are basic, with nothing of any real originality in evidence; save for one small, newly ordained tidbit of screen comedy. That would be the personality and delivery of non-actor and star, John Denver.ALL THROUGH THE story, we find controversy and conflict with Jerry Landers' unbelievable claims of having talked to the Almighty. Be it his boss, his wife (Terri Garr-woo, woo, woo, woo!), his neighbors or leaders of the Major Faiths, the reactions are the same end results; that being a hilarious and ever building audience reaction.BUT, THE FRIVOLITY only goes so far as the comical aspects find themselves being tempered with what can only be interpreted as being a 'Message!'BUT THE STORY (as would a real life situation) demand consultation with a Higher Authority. In this case, a committee of inquiry is assembled; which is composed of prominent clerics from all across the spectrum of believers. We have Barry Sullivan (Bishop Reardon), Jeff Corry (Rabi Silverstone), Titos Vandis (Eastern Orthodox Bishop) and others. NEEDING AN ADDITIONAL plot twist, the scenarist opts for having God/George Burns taking exception to one member of this Omnibus of Ecumenical Ecclesiastics as being unworthy and a wealth seeking phony. The writer picks a politically target in actor Paul Sorvino's characterization of Tele Evangelist, Rev. Willie Williams. (Southern Whites and Fundamentalist Christians are and have been fair game for vilification in both life and fiction.)THE CRESCENDO OF the story is finally reached in the Judicial Proceedings that follow. This also brings us what is arguably the best gag in the movie. That is, when God is called upon to take the stand and, when sworn in with the words, ......so help you God!, George Burns replies, So help me, me!OTHERWISE, THE COURT scenes are cleverly played in the manner of those in Frank Capra's MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN (Columbia, 1937). The cast is also staffed with many veterans and guest stars such as Donald Pleasance, Ralph Bellamy, William Daniels, Barnard Hughes, George Furth, Dinah Shore and even Director, Carl Reiner steps before the camera to join the fun.IN THE END, God just vanishes; having left his message with the John Denver/Jerry Landers character and to us, the audience; that we may think over what it meant.

Oh, and throw in a country/western singer who only made a few movie appearances, and you have the sleeper of 1977, a comic gem that takes punches almost prophetically at evangelists who only a decade later would take public whacks in real life.John Denver is Jerry Mathers, a humble grocery store assistant manager in Tarzana, California who isn't much of a believer in spiritual matters and happens to be chosen by the big G. himself to go out and spread the word that he still exists, is watching over us, and has given us everything we need to make our world work, warning us not to destroy it. 35 years later, this film is still timely, even if certain elements of the details of the script fit 70's mentalities. (Why a remake with Betty White hasn't been done is beyond me!) At first, you only hear the raspy-voiced God until Jerry politely demands to see him, having frustrated his quirky wife Teri Garr with discussions of their first meeting. But when George Burns finally appears in flannel shirt and baseball cap, you know you're dealing with a God out to prove that vaudeville isn't dead, only captured in heavenly terms.Dealing with district manager David Ogden Steirs (of MASH TV fame) and C.E.O. William Daniels (1776's John Addams) in his professional life, Denver is warned that these visits with God are endangering his career. But God has another job for Denver, and that involves a money-hungry evangelist, brilliantly played by Paul Sorvino with such arrogant cockiness that you long to see him knocked down a peg or two and have him scream to his pulpit, I have sinned!, like a few others would within the next decade. Cameos by such famous faces as Ralph Bellamy, Barnard Hughes and Donald Pleasance round out Larry Gelbart's brilliant screenplay, apparently adapted by director Carl Reiner on its first draft, and deservedly receiving an Oscar Nomination.The film covers some major issues still important to day. God comments on cereals and all of the chemicals that are turning kids into garbage cans. He comments on The Exorcist and how people could believe the devil on earth, but not him. He discusses Jesus as his son, the ultimate vessel for communication with him, and when sworn in to testify tells judge Hughes with his hands on the bible, So help me me. God also reveals here through Reiner's simply stated screenplay that it only takes one man to create a storm of spirituality, and with this, we also see the religious freaks that utilize organized religion for their own agendas and even sexual fantasies. The performances are direct, to the point, and totally honest, and to top it off, there is a wonderful cameo by then popular afternoon TV hostess Dinah Shore, long before the Oprah's, Jerry Springers and Sally Jesse Raphael's. Having seen this film many years ago when it was first released, I felt its simple message touching my soul, and almost forty years later, it still remains pertinent. At times, the screenplay does have a child-like quality to it, but that is important, because this is a film for all ages and generations to see and pick out individually how it touches them. Believer or not, you can't help but see the possibilities, and in today's ultra-cynical world (10 times more than the mid-late 1970's) consumed with robot-creating technology, this is truly a faith restorer.

After several decades out of the movie business, he starred in several films that were surprising successes. He did stand-up comedy in Las Vegas. He appeared on talk shows and told silly jokes about smoking cigars, outliving his doctors, and hanging out with women one-fourth his age. He was an octogenarian movie star, and Oh, God! was released around the peak of his latter-day fame.The film begins with God (in the form of George Burns) appearing in supermarket manager Jerry's (John Denver) bathroom. God tells Jerry to get The Word out, so Jerry tells his story to a reporter (George Furth). This of course attracts the attention of several wackos and many theologians (including Jeff Corey, Paul Sorvino, and Donald Pleasance), much to the dismay of Jerry's wife (Teri Garr). There's an amusing courtroom sequence, and Jerry and God say goodbye and part ways. The movie is lightly entertaining with a warm message and has lots of good scenes, but trust me, it has no real laughs. Burns is his usual self, and Denver is surprisingly good in an uncharacteristic acting role. Garr and especially Sorvino (playing an outrageous TV evangelist) stand out in the supporting cast. Two inferior sequels with Burns but without Denver were later released.A lot of the shine has worn off Oh, God! since 1977. Burns and Denver are no longer with us, and George Burns' 1970s fame has been gone for 30 years. Many people probably know very little about either Burns or Denver, their memories fading every day. During the mid-1970s, Burns was an unlikely celebrity, with all the trappings that accompanied it (I used to cringe when Johnny Carson would imply that Burns was actually dating women in their early 20s). The novelty of seeing singer-songwriter John Denver in a movie is long gone. So, the general cultural atmosphere surrounding George Burns and this film has changed completely in the past 34 years. Oh, God! is still good, but to me the movie used to be a lot better, way back in 1977.

God asks him to get His message out to the world.Landers, who is skeptical of the kindly old man who asks for his help, and a non-believer in God, tries to get out the message by any means. He eventually gets on national television, and in front of a panel of religious leaders, who ask him to have God answer a list of questions, written in an ancient and extinct language.Now, Landers has to prove to the court of the existence of God, while trying to defend himself in a slander suit filed against him by a televangelist over comments Landers credits to God, who claims the televangelist is a fraud.Let me say that, when I first saw this, I thought it was funnier. Having seen it all these years later, the jokes fell flat in my opinion. However, I was not once offended by any joke in the film. The humor targets a lot of questions believers and non-believers of the Almighty ask when questioning their beliefs, but not once is offensive. If you ask me now, the jokes are worth a couple of chuckles.For anybody who is a hardcore believer, who will walk up to a stranger to give his or her testimony and try to convert the person, I can guarantee you that you will not be offended with this movie at all. The subject matter is handled with extreme care, and is handled perfectly by Denver, and especially Burns.The performances in this movie are pretty good if you ask me. Terri Garr, who portrays Denver's wife, plays her character as a woman who is skeptical of her husband's believe that he was visited by God, but supports him no matter what. Denver was pretty good in his role, never missing a beat as Burns straight man, and handled his character's transformation in the film nicely.Burns though is easily the star of this film, and made God one of his most memorable roles in his career. Anybody who has seen this movie, or its two sequels have never forgotten Burns in this role. To his fans, this and his role with the love of his life, Gracie Allen, is fondly remembered.This film is perfect for families, as their is no violence or swearing. Younger children may not understand the message of the film, but might enjoy some of the jokes. Older kids will understand the message, and may have questions about their own faith.The supporting cast is not well developed in this film, especially the televangelist, who was the most vocal in the counsel that asked Landers to have God answer the questions they gave him. Personally, I would have liked to have seen the televangelist go to his flock and the media to try to discredit Landers in his believe he saw God. Just having God tell Landers to call the guy a fraud to help set up the court scene was a bit weak in my opinion.There is some special effects in this film, but you can tell they were all done by editing. They just don't hold up after all these years. The soundtrack was completely forgettable as well.In my opinion, this movie is not bad. I would suggest to watch it on television if there is nothing else on.

The movie was written by television comedy writer Larry Gelbart and directed by TV icon Carl Reiner. John Denver, in his first acting role, plays the character who talks to God and has to convince everyone that he exists. There aren't really any huge laughs in this movie, but it has some funny parts and the movie and it's message are just genuinely appealing. The idea that a normal guy can be chosen by God to spread his simple message to the world is something we want to believe in. Denver's character is an assistant manager at a supermarket when he gets a letter to meet God for an interview on the 27th floor of a building that only has 17 floors. At first he only hears God's voice, but then he appears in the form of George Burns -- supposedly a form the character can understand -- and then tries to convince his wife and kids(unsuccessfully) and then others. God is eventually given a test which he answers and delivers to an evangelical preacher but also expresses that he's a phony. The preacher then sues him and sets up a courtroom scene where God reveals himself to others(in his own George Burns-like way, of course). This is a very well done simple movie done by a couple of TV icons who then were able to do bigger things in the film world because of the success of this movie. A low-key gem that's not perfect but well done and good for the whole family. Don't miss it.

Whether or not you liked or still like John Denver, or thecrusty cigar-chomping curmugeon George Burns, this movie still hascharm. It may reek of the middle 1970's back to the earth andspiritualism that pervaded the times, but it was nice to see a simplefunny film that made you think what if. It was perfectly cast and perfectly acted. JD was that grocery storeclerk married and faithful and devoted to family and community. Yet heknew the world wasn't right and probably felt that he was just a nothingof a man and wanted nothing more than to do his job, raise his familyand be nice to his neighbors (although many of them were notinterested). And God chose him to deliver a message that you may or maynot believe God would deliver, but it is still a good message of what asociety should be or could be. And yet, people hear for a moment butstill go back to thier ways.  And that is why this movie is still alight in the forest that can open your heart to the possibilities raisedin the film. It may be a comedy and far-fetched but it still has amessage, albeit delivered in a folksy Hee-haw style..yet it is stillresonates with the child in all of us!

From the opening scenes, the main character Jerry Landers displays positive symptoms related to schizophrenia, such as delusional thinking, disordered thought, auditory, and eventually visual hallucinations. As is common in sufferers of schizophrenia, the delusions and hallucinations almost exclusively focus on themes of religiosity and grandiosity. After claiming to have conversations with God, Jerry's delusions expand further into beliefs that he is the Savior of man kind, sent to the spread the word of God and has the ability to talk with the Almighty. When sharing these thoughts and experiences with others, Jerry is often the butt of a joke within the community and among his peers. What is very sadly lost in the comedy surrounding Jerry's illness is the stigma that Jerry receives from his family and co-workers. After divulging the nature and subject matter of his hallucinations and delusions to his family, both Jerry's wife and children use discriminatory labels to describe his thoughts and behaviour such as crazy and bananas. Despite having strong connections to psychiatric professionals, Jerry's family fails to get him the help he so sorely needs. Instead, the his wife and children express either extreme denial or a wish to no longer be associated with this kind of crazy.Two heart-wrenching moments stand out in particular in regards to the stigma Jerry faces after his struggle with mental illness becomes public. First, Jerry is asked to appear on a late night talk show to speak about his hallucinations and delusions. Instead of seeking this as an opportunity to increase awareness and support for mental illness, the host of the talk show seems to find Jerry's severe symptoms amusing and coaxes him into situations where Jerry finds himself ridiculed for his crazy ideas. Second, after becoming alarmed by Jerry's behaviour and seeing the negative public exposure he is getting, Jerry's fictional employer Food World invites him to the corporate office where Jerry receives the height of prejudice and persecution. The supervisor asks Jerry to either stop his current public display of mental illness, or risk being demoted and eventually fired. Though early intervention may have helped Jerry, the refusal to recognize his illness as real and immediate forces him into a deeper psychotic state. He then feels himself pushed to confront a high level religious leader about his thoughts and this is where the story takes an even more drastic and terrible turn. Jerry finds himself the object of a court case, confronted not with sympathy but prosecution of his illness. During his court case, Jerry leaps deeper and more fully into a delusional state, convincing an ordinary witness that he himself is God on the stand. This causes such a commotion that court is then put into recess. It is through the kindness of an sympathetic judge that Jerry narrowly escapes legal action. However, in his parting words to Jerry, the judge states As much as 'we' feel what has happened here is real, God did not appear before us today. Though these words may have been meant to nudge Jerry into recovery, they merely invalidate the experience of the schizophrenic patient. It would have seemed apt that at this point in the movie Jerry receive the help he so dearly deserved; however, the ending is more aligned with the reality that those with mental illness face. Jerry is released back into society untreated, and left to his own devices.It is sad to say that in spite of being made more than thirty years ago, this movie still resonates truths present for those suffering from mental illness today. Watch this movie with loved ones, friends and family, and open the discussion. No one should have to go through what Jerry did alone.

God is becoming less and less a part of our lives because it doesn't exist beyond our own imagination.This movie also is outdated with the message. Yes, it is a feel good movie, but it lacks a more universal appeal to all religions. It focuses on only Americans and Christianity.George Burns plays a great part as does the rest of the cast but watching this movie more than once is pointless. Although there are specific scenes where George Burns bitch-slaps some of the christian leaders for focusing on money and fame.I like George Burns a lot and he makes the movie work; without him it falls flat.

Unfortunately, in the name of humor - and it IS funny - they make the fatal mistake most Biblically- ignorant people make they put God on the same level as human beings. So, here we see God portrayed humorously by George Burns but really not a whole lot more than any good human being, anything but holy and perfect God. For just one example, in the film, God admits he makes mistakes. If that were true, he wouldn't be God. Puh-leeze.There are tons of secular feel-good stuff in here and that satisfied the masses, which embraced this film enough to have a horrible sequel or two. Even the title of the movie is blasphemous, using the Lord's name as an exclamation and nothing else. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed watching this. IIt's a nice movie with some good laughs and some memorable scenes....but not the Truth, folks. Mr. Denver and Mr. Burns could both tell you that now. By the way, kudos for Denver's performance. For a guy who was strictly a singer, his acting was excellent in here....and it was always fun to watch and hear Burns.

Don't look too deeply for any spiritual truths though, while the film basicly lists things people who belive in God (no particular religion needed) should already know on faith, any close inspection is both futile and irrelevent.We can only hope that if there is a God, he is both as loving and charismatic as how Burns portrays him.

God tells him to spread the word that He is still alive and that people have to believe in Him and take care of the world and themselves. Landers tries to convince people that he met God and pass on his message, but everybody--including his loving wife (Teri Garr)--think he's crazy.Mild comedy that became a huge hit. It looks (and plays) like a TV movie but that's probably why people liked it--it gave them something that they were used to and doesn't try to make them think or react. The wonderful casting choice of Burns as God and his impeccable comic timing and non-stop one-liners make this enjoyable. The problem is that it might make you smile or laugh a little but there are very few very funny bits--just amusing ones. There's absolutely no edge or dark side to any of this. Also the plot has holes in it (the ending is VERY abrupt) and Denver is just so-so in his role. However all the supporting roles are filled with great comedic actors (Paul Sorvino is VERY funny as a phony religious reverend) and it moves fairly quickly. When this came out there were protests (by people who hadn't even seen the film) in front of theatres saying the film made fun of God and Catholicism. After a week or two they disappeared after people actually saw the movie wasn't an insult. A little TOO mild but enjoyable. I give it a 6. Followed by the truly terrible sequel Oh God! Book II.

I didn't think the film was particularly amusing, but I did appreciate some of God's thoughts on how we earthlings could work to get along better. Seemed to me as though the producer concocted a humanistic, feel good creator as opposed to a more demanding one which is what we really have. No doubt the makers of Oh, God felt HE would be more palatable in this form.

Right in the middle of Oh, God!, in which supermarket manager John Denver tries convincing his family and the rest of the world that he's frequently visited by the Almighty himself, the protagonist is given a list of very tough religious questions and is locked in a room to answer them; just as he hopes, God (George Burns) pops in and fills out the questionnaire to help this young man out (and ostensibly prove to people he isn't crazy). This sequence is so cogent and well-acted by Denver and Burns that it surely will be the catalyst to turn the movie's third act around and give us some believers. Sadly, director Carl Reiner and screenwriter Larry Gelbart (working from a witless book by Avery Corman) completely drop the ball, and Denver ends up in a courtroom. What might have been a sentimental but incisive look at religion today is turned into an updating of Topper, with Burns exiting the room like the Invisible Man. A waste of a good premise, although George is wonderful in this, one of his defining roles. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Disliked this film","Date":"22 September 2004","Score":"1 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  This is a warning to everyone. This comment is going to be a negative review of this film. This film is one of the most blasphemous films that has ever been produced. The first thing that is wrong with this film is the statement that Jesus is not the only Son of God. Jesus is the only Son of God. Jesus is the only way of salvation. Another thing that is wrong with this film is that God is portrayed as a cigar smoker. Another thing that is wrong with this film is the premise that the Almighty is going to let everybody in Heaven. That premise is false. Not everybody will go to Heaven. Another thing that is wrong with this film is that the Almighty could be seen by someone. That is a false concept.  "}]
