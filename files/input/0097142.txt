No one is let off easy in this film about an old man (played to perfection by Jack Lemmon) who has his wife do everything for him. BUt his wife has a heart attack and is put in the hospital. His son (Ted Danson) has to return home to take care of his father. What comes from there is an adventure that will warm you heart as fast as it will break it. Jack Lemmon is very believeable as the father that you will believe that he actually is 85 years old and Ten Danson has never been better in a film. This film devlves into hard topics such as divorce, marraige and family relationships and none of these subjects are delt with lightly and is sure to bring a tear to the eye of everyone whether you can realte to these characters or not.

However trouble looms as Lemmon will be diagnosed with cancer and go into an emotional tail-spin that could kill him.

Here he is truly believable and his scenes with his own son tug at your heart they are so real. No Hollywood quickfix here for the relationship, the boy is simply closer to his grandfather than he is to his own father and nothing will change that fact.What I liked most about the film  was that the theme in less worthy hands could have been made sloppily sentimental, but here it is totally restrained both in script and direction and it makes for a really meaningful movie.  The characters remain real all the way through and the script does not transform them into wondrous saints by movie's end.It is the wonderful understatement in it all that captivated me and made me weep at the end.  Jack is truly unforgettable and Olympia magnificent in her dryness and cynicism. I have seen it 3 times and each time relished another scene a little more.  This time around it was Jack dragging his wife around to meet the neighbours he was not even aware of before and her long suffering face at this new and reinvented Jack makes you laugh out loud.  Bravo to all.  An 8 1/2 out of 10. And that scene where they dance, oh me oh my......who needs naked bodies writhing on a bed, this has sensuousness, love and intimacy in it, the real kind.

Almost every movie came out from Hollywood is for profit only, this movie is very touching, and purely family oriented. I don't know how much it has made so far, but I doubt that it is a popular movie for the general public.Having said that, I think that this movie has touched a very deep part of our lives. All of us have to face the fact that our parents are growing old, and one day they will leave us forever. It is quite emotional. How many of the people living in the USA now have the courage, time and money to actually live with their older parents till the day they apart.This movie brought three generations all together, and showed us a well-done drama. It does not have a happy ending. However, it gives us a very realistic feeling that we all have or had to face. So watch this movie when it is raining outside. I am sure that you can have a good cry.

I initially only wanted to watch Dad to see a younger Ethan","Date":"1 January 2008","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":" I admit. I initially only wanted to watch Dad to see a younger Ethan Hawke. Fifteen minutes into the film, I was bawling my eyes out. This is unusual for me, as I'm not exactly the weepy type and I only usually cry in tearjerkers featuring Old Yeller, Fluke and Free Willy (somehow, animals emote more convincingly).I thought Dad would be a boring, heartwarming drama, but I pleasantly discovered that it had its share of laughs. This movie is excellently cast and well written. It jars the senses long after you've seen it because it forces you to face things you'd rather not deal with, ever, but will inevitably have to losing someone you love.The film opens with a young Jack Lemmon at sunrise, starting work at his ranch with his beautiful, supportive wife and kids. Then, a sequence to establish his present character an old frail man being taken care of by his overbearing wife (convincingly played by Olympia Dukakis), from dressing him up, putting toothpaste on his toothbrush, to buttering his toast. He accompanies his wife, who drives them both to the grocery, where she gets a heart attack. He helplessly looks on.While she is temporarily hospitalized, the children worry about their father. The son (Ted Danson) is a successful corporate type, who quickly flies in to see to it that everything's okay. He is met by his brother-in-law (Kevin Spacey), and his sister (Kathy Baker).The absentee son is shocked to see how much his father has deteriorated, and so spends more time with him out of guilt. He doesn't intend to stay long as he has business to attend to, and so he makes sure that his father can be independent and take care of himself.Pretty soon, Dukakis is back and is surprised to see her husband up and about. All is well till it's his turn to suddenly get hospitalized. The doctor suspects cancer. Soon, he's in a coma, and the son does everything he can to care for his father. Somewhere in the middle of this, his own son (Ethan Hawke), comes in. He is estranged from his father but is apparently very close to his grandfather.After what seems like ages, and now in the hands of a more compassionate, competent doctor, the old man wakes up. He celebrates his new lease on life by being more carefree, lively and spontaneous. He has been diagnosed to be a bit schizophrenic, with the film's opening sequence revealing the dream life he's been living in his head to cope with his problems. His family is astonished, but humors him, except for his wife, who openly shows her displeasure at his apparent craziness.But later on, it is his new zest for life that infects everyone and brings the family together. It helps the old couple open their world to new things and new people at that stage in their life. In the end, cancer does overcome his body, but not his spirit and of those around him.I like how the movie finishes on a positive yet realistic note, without milking the situation with an embarrassing display of melodrama.It's a scary thing to watch someone you've always known as strong slowly wither before you. It must have been excruciating for the son to watch his own father not be able to do the things that he used to do, not even dress himself up. This was also painfully illustrated in one scene where the son, angry at the poor treatment his father endured from the first doctor, carries his dad out of the hospital. The father's body appeared so weak and frail in his son's arms. This role reversal a la Pieta comes as quite a shocker, as it disturbs the equilibrium an awful lot.As the eldest child, I've had the good fortune to enjoy my parents at their prime. I grew up content in the belief that I always had my strong, funny, patient father and my always organized and in-control mother to take care of anything, big or small. And then I aged in years, but still terribly spoiled and immature, while my folks seem to have silently been plateauing.While my folks have not been as terribly sick as in the movie, the threat of it happening is always there. Dad has been a wake-up call for me to reevaluate what matters most in life and to reallocate my time to doing the things that are truly of value.Everyone can relate to this film because everyone has parents, or someone they depend on or are close to. There is no big villain to hate or escape from in this film; no unrealistic and complicated plot twists, telenovela-style. Nothing, that is, except the bigger danger of apathy, the silent killer in each of our relationships. Therein lies the true conflict, and the earlier we choose to recognize it and act on it, the better our relationships can be.Now who would've known such knowledge could stem from a desire to see Ethan Hawke?

OK so maybe not all, but certainly somewhere along the line one ore more of the aforementioned list should have been This film was extremely heart-warming and tugged at the heart-strings in equal measures.Ted Danson plays a man called John Tremont who rearranges his life when his mother, Bette, (his father, Jake, has allowed her to do virtually everything for him.

Suddenly the high-powered business man has to find his relationship with his father again and he does this by giving back to him what is missing from his life. The bond they end up with is extremely strong. So much so that he stays with his father the whole time when he, after his mother gets well and comes out of hospital, ends up in hospital himself.The supporting cast are just as good. You know instantly that daughter Annie is the one that normally looks after her elderly parents while John does the high-flying businessman bit only to then take more of a back-seat role when John rearranges his life. Mario, the third sibling, cannot be there to help as much as he would like due to living so far away does return to the family when there is need for him to do so.

The problem here is that the performance became lopsided somewhat when the focus of the picture changes to the idea that Lemmon, who comes out of a coma, has been hallucinating for all these years thinking that he has had an alternate life in New Jersey.Olympia Dukakis stars as his elderly wife who just can't take his discussion of this life and in one scene, the emotional outburst between her and loving son, a very good Ted Danson, is truly memorable. Kathy Baker is wasted as Danson's divorced wife. The way the two acted towards each other, you are left wondering why they divorced to begin with.

One morning they go to the grocery store like they often do when suddenly Bette didn't feel so good. In New York, their son John, a stockbroker, was busy working on a new business deal when his sister Annie called and told him that Mom had a heart attack so John raced out to California to see her. Bette was ill but wouldn't admit it. She was a feisty one. Then John went with Annie and her husband Mario to the house to see Dad. Jake hadn't been told the whole truth about Bette and they had decided it would be better if he wasn't. Mario and Annie leave then. John agreed to stay with Jake until Bette came home. John helped Jake around and soon began teaching him household chores, like laundry separating whites from coloreds, but when they got to a white shirt with black stripes, they couldn't decide. They then clean the house until it's spotless and to celebrate, they treat themselves to a game of bingo. John then tells Jake the unvarnished truth about Bette's heart attack so they go to the hospital to visit her. Bette was always so over- protective of Jake and was a little anxious about his having as much fun as he did.       Soon Jake went down to get his driver's license. The driving instructor was a snob about John being in the car with them so he got out and was luck would have it, Jake got his driver's license. It wasn't long before Bette was all better and came home. John's son, Billy, a freshman in college, came for a visit. He had been to Mexico and considered leaving school, but other than that, things were finally looking up, until one day Jake discovered some blood in his urine. They go to the hospital where Dr. Santana tells them the awful truth Jake had cancer. A disease which was unnerving to him just by the mere mention. That wasn't the half of it. He soon developed senility and seizures. John was mad that the hospital was barely doing anything to help Jake so John picked up Jake and carried him home. The poor old guy just wasn't doing well at all and that night, he crawled under the bed and proceeded to cry and quiver. John felt helpless so he put Jake back in the hospital, but this time a different doctor administered to him Dr. Chad, and he was much nicer, helpful and more positive than Dr. Santana. He even let John stay at the hospital with Jake. John wasn't doing too well either but he decreed he would stay with Jake until he died so he could mark the event. But miracles do happen for the next morning, Jake woke up as good as new. Dr. Chad reported the cancer was gone and Jake was, well, a new man.         He most definitely was a new man. He was so new that Bette didn't even recognize him anymore. He began acting as if he were a teenager. He had what a doctor diagnosed as pschitsophrenia (I'm not the world's greatest speller). Jake began talking about a farm he had in New Jersey and that he had four kids. Bette was worried but she was told to play along, after all, she was mostly responsible for Jake's behavior. Her constant overprotectivess caused him to be so isolated. Unless she went along, he'd return to that state. Jake and Bette went to greet their new neighbors and even learned about the Japanese culture. It was almost too much for Bette to take. But then one day, fate dropped another bomb shell Dr. Chad reported that Jake's cancer had returned and it spread. He went to the hospital. John went too. They talked a bit about the 1947 World's Series. After the funeral, John returned to New York but felt that this whole experience had taught him about how important families really are to you.

When Hollywood goes the shameless route, look out gullible viewers become roadkill. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Pitiless","Date":"17 August 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":" Lemmon gets here an important and ferociously painful to watch feral role.No need to mention that Lemmon immediately gets the upper hand of the other actors.The rest of the cast is simply unimportant.I detest the people who asked Lemmon to act in this movie;it was unspeakable fiendish to ask an only 64 years old Lemmon to appear in such a role.The script narrates many facts,with many twists.An oldster,Jake,78 years,has his insipid routinethe garden,the greenhouse.He knows his environment.His wife is tough,sarcastic,authoritarian,prosaic,dry;she cares about Jake,but in a wrong,crushing way.She has a heart attack.While she is hospitalized,Jake's son,a boss,a successful businessman,comes to live with his father and takes charge of him.He finds Jake older than he expected;so,he treats his so old father well,gives him chicken in red wine,etc..Jake learns to drive,does some sport,seems to live again.And,suddenly,he is struck by a misfortune.He got an urinary problem.Then,shock,coma,and a recovery.In fact,he slipped out of his nightmarish world,it hurts him no more.He is a succesfull schizophrenic,and entirely taken over by his joy in living (sex at all hours,as his wife complains;masquerades;lots of eccentricities).It seems this is the real,the final Jake T..He is on the fringe of death.He resumes his lifeWe just got off the track a little... a lot.(No need to say that this proletarian, worker,oldish, senile, decomposed,lop-sided Lemmon character is not the Lemmon we knew from Days of Wine and Roses ,Save the Tiger ,Irma La Douce ,Missing.)Dad is an atrocious, dreary,sore, mournful movie.Mind-butchering, brain-slaughtering story. It is psychologically brutal and very cruel.It is a punch in the stomach. "}]
