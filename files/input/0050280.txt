[{"Title":"A landmark horror movie with a remarkable performance from Peter Cushing.","Date":"25 April 2004","Score":"37 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  'The Curse Of Frankenstein' is a landmark horror movie for several reasons. Firstly, though Hammer had already released 'The Quatermass Xperiment', a science fiction movie with some horror elements, it was the studios first real entry into the genre which it is still revered around the world for. Secondly, it was the first movie inspired by Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' made in colour. And thirdly, while it wasn't the first movie to feature both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, it was their first horror movie together, and one which introduced one of THE great screen duos, who eventually made over twenty movies together. Lee doesn't have as much on screen time as one might expect, but his Monster is memorable and visually striking (after Universal threatened to sue if the image of Karloff's monster was copied). As well as Lee, the supporting cast includes good performances from Robert Urquhart and Hazel Court. Urquhart plays Paul Krempe, initially the young Baron's tutor (the Baron being briefly portrayed by Melvyn Hayes before Cushing), and later his often unwilling assistant. Court, best remembered for her roles in some of Roger Corman's Poe series, plays the Baron's cousin/fiancee. The standout performance of the movie is by Peter Cushing. I still think Karloff is the definitive Monster but Cushing is the definitive Baron Frankenstein. There were six sequels to 'The Curse Of Frankenstein' and Cushing played Frankenstein in all but one, the second last in the series 'The Horror Of Frankenstein', which was actually a tongue in cheek remake of 'Curse..' starring Ralph Bates as the Baron. The movie wasn't completely successful and thankfully Cushing returned for the final movie 'Frankenstein And The Monster From Hell'. For me the first and last in the series tie as the best Hammer Frankenstein movies and Cushing is remarkable in them both. I highly recommend 'The Curse Of Frankenstein', one of Hammer's greatest horror movies. No-one can truly call themselves a horror movie fan if they haven't seen it.

Originally planned as a 'quota quickie',  and, as Terence Fisher  stated. As a send-up, it ended up changing the British Film Industry for all time. It had gone international.  Fisher owed Hammer a film,  and somehow he managed to pull a script together in much the same manner as the Baron did body parts.  It has been said that Jack Warner hated the film,  but released it anyway,  opening in the very theatre where 'The House of Wax' had premiered several years before.  It was a success,  much to the delight of Warner,  and to Hammer.  It also marked the beginning of the screen-teaming of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.  Today, the film seems a bit slow and not quite sure where it's going,  but in 1957 it delivered a wallop in vivid color, to a long-waiting  legion of fans.  This was the true jumping-off point for Hammer, a small company who had been in production for a number of years,  and they filled the void left by the American majors in the production of the 'horror film.'  In a way,  the film's tag-line kept it's promise.... 'The Curse of Frankenstein will haunt you forever.'Quite by accident,  'The Hammer Look'  changed the face of the fantasy film for all time.

Here we get a new take on the familiar Frankenstein myth with the young Frankenstein coming from a fatherless background and embracing only science and reason with any real conviction. Finally when a breakthrough comes, the Young master will stop at nothing to achieve the fame, glory and notoriety he desires--his lack of regard for others is frightening even to his mentor Paul Krempe(played excellently by Robert Urquhart)who warns him against tampering with the forces of nature and that nothing good will come from it. Cushing is outstanding in the role and adds a real sense of tragedy, genius and malice. Hazel Court is certainly lovely as the innocent cousin Elizabeth who naively becomes entangled into Frankenstein's sinking path of unconscious self-destruction.

Along with partner Enrique Carreras, Hinds became a film distributor, but that wasn't really the end of Hammer's history, as many years later, Carreras' son James joined Hinds' son Anthony and together with their parents, resurrected Hammer Film Productions in 1949. The next two important events in Hammer's history were the hiring of director Terence Fisher in 1951, and the enormous success of 1955's horror film, The Quatermass Xperiment, as they would play important roles the company's future. While Hammer was preparing Quatermass 2, they gave Terence Fisher the chance to resurrect Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and Hammer Horror was born.In The Curse of Frankenstein, Peter Cushing plays Baron Victor Frankenstein, who after losing his family at a young age, hires scientist Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) as a mentor. Along Krempe, the young Baron develops his enormous genius for science, becoming great friends and colleagues as he grows up. During one of their experiments, they discover a way to bring a dead dog back to life, an amazing discovery that excites both scientists as it could be of enormous use for medicine. However, Victor wants to go further, and decides that the next step is the creation of life. Krempe refuses to help Victor in that experiment, but decides to stay in the house to protect Victor's cousin Elizabeth (Hazel Court), who has arrived to marry Victor, unsuspecting of her fiance√©'s experiments. The Baron's obsession with his experiment will prove to be more dangerous than what Krempe thinks.The screenplay for this new version of Shelley's classic was written by Jimmy Sangster, who had previously written X The Unknown for Hammer the previous year. Unlike what happens in Universal's 1931 classic adaptation, the plot is completely focused on the Baron's figure instead of on the creature, which gives a new and fresh angle to the story, as it explores Frankenstein's obsessions and how they begin to consume his life. To achieve this, Sansgter adds a lot of human drama and character development that at times makes the film more a Gothic tragedy than a typical horror film, but even when limited, Sangster's use of suspense is still pretty effective. It still isn't exactly a straight adaptation of Shelley's novel, but Sangster's screenplay does offer an interesting idea by not making the Creature a misunderstood monster, but the literal symbol of Frankenstein's failure and corruption.Anyways, while Jimmy Sangster's screenplay is indeed worthy of recognition, it was really Terence Fisher's work as a director what ultimately gave Hammer horror it's true face. While already an experienced director by the time he made The Curse of Frankenstein, Fisher found in Hammer's horror films the creative freedom that allowed him to explore new realms in this reinterpretations of old classics. His care for details in set design and costume design give the film a great look that equals the one of movies with bigger production values, and using vibrant colors, he puts a special emphasis on blood for the first time. There are also several sexual overtones in the film that give the movie a different style to previous incarnations of the novel, an element that Fisher would take further in posterior movies, specially in Dracula and The Curse of the Werewolf. The Curse of Frankenstein is also the film that introduced two of the most important actors in the horror genre since the days of Universal's movies Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. As Baron Frankenstein, Cushing delivers an outstanding performance that can be considered among the best in the history of the genre. Making a fascinating character out of the unsympathetic Baron is not easy, but Cushing succeeds remarkably and completely makes the movie his own. Lee has a considerably smaller role as the Creature, but while Dracula would be the movie where he would shine the most, here he delivers a powerful performance as the Monster. As Frankenstein's mentor, Paul Krempe, Robert Urquhart is pretty effective and makes a great counterpart to Cushing's Baron. Hazel Court is less successful as Elizabeth, although it's not really a bad performance at all.It's hard not to think about comparing Fisher's interpretation of Frankenstein to the legendary movie made by James Whale 26 years before for Universal, but really, in the end it's a pointless exercise as both movies are so different from each other (and different from Shelley's novel) that there's no proper way to compare them. While one has a powerful story of a misunderstood monster (played brilliantly by Boris Karloff), the other is a tale of ambition and obsessions where the monster is nothing more than the ultimate result of Frankenstein's evil, so it's impossible to tell which one is the best of the two. What can really be said about The Curse of Frankenstein is that it suffers from an extremely slow pace that may turn off some viewers, although as the story unfolds, this slow pace does pay off in the end and helps to build up a perfect Gothic atmosphere.An enormously successful film, The Curse of Frankenstein began the style of Gothic horror that would later be labeled as Hammer Horror. With Fisher at the helm, Hammer would become a great influence in how the genre was developed through the 60s, giving it new life and pushing the boundaries of the era. While maybe overshadowed by Fisher's posterior masterpieces, The Curse of Frankenstein is still one of the best tales of Gothic horror that have appeared on the silver screen. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Even if we dared to omit its landmark importance; it's still a terrific movie.","Date":"6 November 2010","Score":"15 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" The Curse Of Frankenstein is out of Hammer Film Productions and based on the novel Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley. It's directed by Terence Fisher, written by Jimmy Sangster and stars Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Hazel Court & Robert Urquhart. Jack Asher is the cinematographer and James Bernard scores the music.The first Hammer film in colour, The Curse Of Frankenstein began the second wave of cinematic horror some 25 odd years after the Universal heyday of the 30s. Where Hammer's version differs from the Universal offerings, who were carefully watching what Hammer were doing, is by focusing on the Baron himself rather than the actual iconic creature. This approach threw many critics and observers at the time, with some either calling it too talky, or worse still, depressing and degrading. But the box office tills rang, both in Britain and America, and now the film is revered by film makers and horror historians alike. Rightly so.Plot basically sees Baron Victor Frankenstein in prison for murder, where faced with the guillotine, he tells to a priest an amazing story of how he and his mentor successfully resurrected a dead body. The resulting creation being the one who committed the murder for which the Baron is now charged. The first masterstroke from Hammer was appointing Fisher and Sangster, the former shoots in lurid Eastmancolor; thus setting the marker for the Gothic style of Hammer to come, the latter produced a crackling script that make the scientist of the piece the actual monster. The second masterstroke was in the casting of Cushing as the driven Frankenstein. Then just a classy actor on TV, Cushing plays it in turns as cold blooded and elegantly charming. Lee, only getting the gig after Bernard Bresslaw's agent demanded too much money, actually doesn't have to do much, but his marionette movements coupled with the fleshy patchwork make up of his face make it totally memorable. Both men of course went on to become horror legends from here.It's far from the best Hammer Horror film, in fact it's not the best of the Universal Creature reinventions. But it adds grit and intelligence to the Gothic atmospherics, its visuals striking as the character based narrative propels eerily forward. 8/10 "},{"Title":"One of the greatest horror movies of all time.","Date":"9 March 2003","Score":"20 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  What more can be said?

While this first entry to Hammer's ingenious Frankenstein series is not one of my personal favorite Hammer Productions, it were this film and the following Horror Of Dracula which basically redefined British Horror, and represent everything the Hammer Studios stand for. Mad Science and the Resurrection of the dead have always been among my favorite Horror topics, and Hammer's Frankenstein films starring the great Peter Cushing are among the most memorable films in the field. My personal favorite film in Hammer's Frankenstein franchise is still the brilliantly insane Frankenstein Created Woman of 1967, but this first film is also brilliant, and furthermore gets the benefit of originality. Sometimes in cinema, actors are predestined to play a certain role - and this is definitely the case with Peter Cushing here. Nobody else could have played the role of the obsessed Baron Victor Frankenstein as Cushing did. When it was Hammer's Dracula that made Christopher Lee the Horror icon he is, it was The Curse Of Frankenstein and its sequel that rose Peter Cushing to immortal fame.Hammer's Baron Frankenstein is more (insanely) dedicated than the character is in the novel or any previous film, and Cushing is brilliant in the role, which he played six times altogether. While he is not necessarily a villain as such (he does what he does with the strong conviction of doing what's necessary for the benefit of mankind), Victor Frankenstein gets more and more dedicated to his obsession of creating artificial life and resurrecting the dead in this first Frankenstein film from Hammer, and, at a certain point, he is willing to do anything in order to achieve his goals. At first he is still supported by his assistant and former teacher Paul Kempe (Robert Urquhart) who gets more and more frightened by his former student's obsessive behavior...I do not want to give too much of the plot away, but I guess everybody knows what the story of Frankenstein is about. As the story of Dracula, the Frankenstein story got its haunting Hammer-style makeover. From today's point of view the graphic depiction of violence and gore in the film may seem tame, but back in the day the early Hammer Classics Curse Of Frankenstein and Horror Of Dracula were some of the first films to actually show red blood, some gore and explicit violence. Both classics were directed by Terence Fisher, easily the most important Hammer director, and, as usual for hammer, the film is greatly photographed in eerie Gothic locations. Gothic castles, foggy grounds and a constantly gloomy mood - this is what makes a lot of the greatness of the world of Hammer. Peter Cushing truly is one of the greatest Horror icons ever, and Hammer's Frankenstein series probably earned him this deserved reputation more than anything else. The monster, by the way, is played by a fellow Horror icon, with whom Cushing formed the most awesome Horror-duo in a whole lot of films, none other than the great Christopher Lee. Hazel Court is a beauty in the female lead, the only tiny negative aspect is the fact that Robert Urquhart's character of Paul sometimes annoys with his moralistic nagging (also, while he is supposed to be Frankenstein's teacher, Urquhart clearly is years younger than Cushing). That does in no way lessen the greatness of this Hammer Classic, however. All said, The Curse Of Frankenstein is a true British Horror Classic, which every Horror fan must see, and no film buff in general should miss!

This latest viewing I believe is only the second time that I've seen Curse, with the first many, many years ago--so long ago that I could barely remember it. In the meantime, I've watched at least a few times, with relatively recent viewings, everything from Universal's 1931 Frankenstein (as well as their 1935 Bride of Frankenstein and other films in that series) to Flesh for Frankenstein (1973), Young Frankenstein (1974), Mary Shelly's Frankenstein (1994), Frankenhooker (1990)--even Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam (1920)--and many other Frankenstein or related films. A few of those I've seen at least 10 times over the years.So I'm coming back to Curse almost as if I'm seeing it for the first time, while already having those films mentioned above as favorites for different aspects of the Frankenstein story, such as atmosphere, visceralness, humor, grandiosity, campiness, and so on. In fact, a number of those films are favorites of all time, period. For me, then, Curse had tough competition on this viewing, and without doing something significantly different with the story, it might fall short.What Curse probably does better than all of the other Frankenstein films that I've seen is relationship dynamics. At the moment, I'd call Curse the soap opera version of the story, which is not really meant as a knock. Here, Victor Frankenstein has lost his father at a very young age--he became Baron at the age of five. The film begins by showing the power and control this young man has over others. He contracts to have a tutor come teach him about science, and together, they begin exploring the scientific basis of life--the life force more specifically, which leads to the usual Frankenstein plot elements.At the same time, however, the focus remains on relationships. We have a complex tutor/student, master/employee, genius/follower relationship between Victor (Peter Cushing) and Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart), his teacher. Victor is engaged to be married--it's an arranged marriage--to Elizabeth (Hazel Court), his cousin, yet he's in at least a lustful relationship with a housekeeper, Justine (Valerie Gaunt). At the same time, Paul seems to have fallen in love with Elizabeth, and it's ambiguous to what extent she may feel the same towards him. The actual curse here seems to be one of difficult/dysfunctional relationships, where everyone is involved in complex power struggles with almost everyone else, and no one quite comes out victorious (ironically enough). All of this stuff is pretty good, if appropriately staid for the Victorian setting (hmmmm . . . lots of occurrences of victor--). On the down side, some of the cinematography/lighting veers towards a soap opera look, which doesn't do much for me.A lot of the usual Frankenstein themes are here, too, but sometimes they almost feel like an afterthought. Christopher Lee, who plays the Frankenstein monster, is severely underused. He remains more in the background throughout the film.Still, lots of the usual Frankenstein film stuff is done well, if a bit subtly. Keeping the monster's body half immersed in fluid was a good idea--there's a creepiness just to the way it looks and it is also unsettling because you wonder why it's only half-submerged. It seems if it needs to be submerged, the whole body should be, so from the beginning of the experiments, it feels more strongly like something is off about Victor. The more visceral body part scenes (like acquiring the hands and eyes) work very well, especially in context, and Lee's make-up was well done, including the fact that he more strongly suggests both a mummy (because of the bandages) and a zombie--the Frankenstein monster should rightly suggest both. Also, the acting is very good throughout--particularly Cushing's performance.But for me, as good as Curse is, it pales in comparison to its Frankenstein brethren. It's good, but other films do the various aspects better, except maybe for the relationship stuff, but for me, that's not enough to elevate Curse to the same echelon as many of those other films.

He has no dialogue and limited screen time, but it is still a stand out performance, combining both menace and pathos.The film starts conventionally with Peter Cushing's baron telling his story in flashback to a visiting priest, but the film itself broke new ground for horror films upon its first showing in 1957. The best scene is the one in which we see the creature take a direct shot in the eye, with the blood gushing out of the wound in streams of vivid red.Behind the scenes, James Bernard's music, Bernard Robinson's production design and Jack Asher's photography considerably enhance the impact of this film, and the whole thing is overseen with great assurance by the director Terence Fisher.

Curse of Frankenstein scared the hell out of its 1957 audience the way few movies ever have, plus it gave us Hammer studios with its retelling of the classic horror monsters with the addition of fine English actors, tight scripts and direction, and really bright red blood and gore in vivid color, plus buxom females with low cut blouses.I saw the movie in 1957 as a little boy and it gave me the screaming willies for weeks after. There is a scene in the picture that I think ranks with the best of the genre and is simply brilliant direction (thanks Terence Fisher). I refer, of course, to the thrown open door revealing to Baron Frankenstein his now living creature, bandaged from head to toe. The creature lifts a hand to his face and rips off his bandages while the camera zooms in herky jerky and slightly off kilter to a closeup of Chris Lee's outrageously grotesque disfigured mug (thanks Phil Leakey). Let me tell you, the scream that audience let out was equal to Carrie's hand coming out of the grave, or the head dropping into the boat hole in Jaws! Man, 1950's audiences just weren't ready for that. This of course was built to a crescendo by the preceding scene of the tank containing the creature draining by itself and that first breath taken while Victor and Paul are arguing downstairs. And it is followed by another big scream when the creature reaches for Justine and we see his reborn shotgun blasted visage.May seem tame to today's audience but it packed a wallop back then. Sufficient to say as noted elsewhere here, it was the highest grossing English picture for quite a while and it put Hammer on the map. As I said, you can't recreate a time past, but I have no doubt the audience in 1931 had the same reaction when Boris Karloff first turned around and there is that amazing closeup of Jack Pierce's brilliant makeup for the monster.Other reviewers have covered the rest of the pluses and minuses of the film so I won't bother. I just wanted to point out that there's a couple of brilliant bits here in makeup, lighting and especially direction that gives this film some distinction from the average fare. They made something different from the material, and despite a lot of problems bringing the film together, they got some damn fine scares with no great budget. That's talent.

Folks who know me won't be surprised that I generally prefer the older 30s Universal versions of the movies, but I have to admit that Hammer is always enjoyable. In this case, they really seem to have returned to the source material effectively, and even added a bit to it without overdoing it. As I recall Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, he was a victim of scientific hubris, but not quite such a cad - but this seems to make sense, as his disregard for the laws of man could easily translate to disregard for sexual mores, much as it did for the men in Shelley's own life. It's a bit longer than the Universal version, and it takes quite a while before we see the monster, but it's enjoyable throughout.

COF is by far the best version of Frankenstein I've seen yet. Great character development and interaction. Set designs, color, mood, etc. All are first rate. And Christopher Lee's monster is very creepy and much more believable than Karloff's. I love Karloff and I love the Universal film but I'm just blown away by how real the Hammer version is. It's very modern almost. They spend a lot of time showing how Frankenstein is inspired to do what he does, and it goes into depth of him getting all the parts, etc. The rebellion of his friend/tutor is a nice touch that again makes this film a lot more real. Someone said it's like a soap opera and I agree in that it spends a lot of time on the relationships. But on to the gore. this movie is really creepy. When Frankenstein leaves and we're left alone with the monster in his life jacuzzi or whatever you want to call it and we know he's about to spring to life is just amazing. There's a lot of nice touches that Hammer always put in the movie. Like the blind man with his grandson, it's just so macabre. It's almost gallows humor. Just real creepy. Way creepier than the girl with the flower in the Universal film. Although Karloff's reaction in that is great mind you. If I had to give Universal credit it would be on that note. We definitely sympathize with his monster more than Lee's. But I don't think Hammer wanted us to sympathize with their monster much. He is more of an abomination that has to be destroyed more than a pitiful creature who is put into unfavorable circumstances through no fault of his own. One last thing, the ending is interesting on two points. They kind of leave Paul and Elizabeths relationship ambiguous. Did they get married? it seems like they might have. Also, there's a whole other way you can take the movie at the end. That the monster was really just a figment of Frankensteins imagination, an alter-ego if you will, that allowed him to kill people without taking responsibility. Look at Paul's reaction at the end when Frankenstein is trying to get him to corroborate his story. It looks as though Paul is genuinely confused and just thinks that Frankenstein is mad. Don't know if that was the implication, just an interesting way to view the movie.

But The Curse of Frankenstein is to me one of the better Frankenstein films, and Hammer's debut film is one of their better ones along with Dracula(1958) and The Mummy(1959). The Monster's make-up is too grotesque for my liking and one does wish that Christopher Lee had more screen time, other than that the film is wonderful.The Curse of Frankenstein does look great, the photography and costumes are handsome and the Gothic set design is outstanding and dripping with atmosphere. The music is chillingly effective and compliments the atmosphere beautifully, while the script is remarkably human, suspensefully and sympathetically written and gives a lot of depth to Frankenstein which I really appreciated actually. The story is always compelling with poignant emotion and Gothic chills once the Monster appears(like with the blind hermit, not as well as Bride of Frankenstein but beautifully done still), it does offer two ideas of focusing more on Frankenstein than on the Monster and not making the Monster misunderstood, both were very interesting takes and while they might not work for some they personally both came over very well.Terrence Fisher's direction is positively unflinching. The characters are well-written, Paul is a love-to-hate sort of character but The Curse of Frankenstein does have to have the most well-developed Frankenstein of any Frankenstein film. The acting is fine, Hazel Court and Robert Urquhart are more than solid support. Christopher Lee's screen time is not large but he is still memorable, even looking at him towering over everyone else Lee does come across as terrifying and his first appearance is chilling. Boris Karloff does bring more tragedy to the character but in all fairness in the 1930s Universal Frankenstein films the Monster was a misunderstood, the Monster here isn't(quite the opposite) and within that idea the film has Lee's more menacing approach worked. The best thing about The Curse of Frankenstein is the performance of Peter Cushing, which is truly remarkable and one of his best. Personally do prefer Cushing's interpretation also to the still excellent interpretation from Colin Clive and it could be to do with that Frankenstein has more development here.All in all, a wonderful film and a wonderful start for Hammer House of Horror. 9/10 Bethany Cox "}{"Title":"A fantastic kick-start to one of the greatest movements in horror","Date":"14 December 2014","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" 26 years after Universal Studios and James Whale hit gold with both critics and audiences alike with their interpretation of Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein, another production studio was about to reinvigorate the horror genre with a vastly different take on the same book. Hammer Studios seemed to know something no-one else did - that audiences had a thirst for blood. The critics may not have appreciated it at the time (though they certainly do now), but the paying audiences lapped up The Curse of Frankenstein's amped-up levels of gore and Gothic atmosphere.The film begins with Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) in a jail cell awaiting his execution for an unknown crime. He calls for a priest who he tells his story to. Victor was only a child where he became a baron and inherited his family's estate, and employed his teacher, Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart), to teach him everything there is to know about the science of anatomy. Years later, Victor and Paul manage to bring a puppy back to life, much to their delight. While Paul is thrilled with their achievement, Victor is unsatisfied and longs to create a human life of his own.Anyone hoping for a faithful re-telling of Mary Shelley's novel will be sorely disappointed. Director Terence Fisher and writer Jimmy Sangster (director of Hammer's Fear in the Night (1972)) makes the film more about Frankenstein than his creation. While the novel focused more on the tragic nature of the Creature's creation and treatment, the film portrays Victor not only as a flawed and arguably misguided visionary, but a stone-cold murderer, pushing a scientific genius to his death in order to have his superior brain for his creation. The brain is damaged in an alteration between Victor and Paul, so the creature is of low intelligence anyway.For all the 're-imaginings' of Frankenstein, this is certainly the best I've seen. The diversions from the source material make it a different experience entirely, and one simply to be enjoyed rather than to ponder it's deeper meanings. Cushing's performance is incredible, adding a gravitas to his character even when the movie dips into camp. Christopher Lee, playing the Creature and in his first of many appearances for Hammer, puts in an impressive physical performance and manages to invite sympathy with no dialogue at all. Hazel Court also appears as Victor's cousin Elizabeth, in what is little more than the obligatory female role. A fantastic kick-start to what would be one of the greatest movements in horror.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Memorable Hammer Horror Version of a Familiar Tale","Date":"4 November 2014","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" One of the earliest Hammer horror movies, THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN tells a familiar tale, one that closely follows the plot of other adaptations, notably James Whale's groundbreaking film for Universal in 1930.What makes Terence Fisher's version so compelling is the way in which the story has been treated; for the late Fifties it is surprisingly explicit in the way it depicts Baron Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) handling various body-parts - eyes, limbs - and at one point is shown sawing the head off the corpse that forms the basis of the monster (Christopher Lee). The principal female characters Elizabeth (Hazel Court) and the maid Justine (Valerie Gaunt) wear period costumes whose d√©coll√©t√© leaves little or nothing to the imagination. The only concession to the more squeamish viewers that Fisher makes is to refrain from showing the Monster killing his various victims, notably Grandpa (Fred Johnson) in gory detail.Cushing turns in a memorable characterization of the Baron - an enthusiastic scientist who has spent much of his life being spoiled. In early sequence, the Baron is shown as a young boy (played by Melvyn Hayes) running the house on his own - ordering the servants around, and engaging a tutor Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) to teach him about life's basics. This independence, acquired at so early an age, has both positive and negative effects the Baron learns to fend for himself, but at the same time proves reluctant to take advice - even when it is well-intentioned. The adult Baron becomes more and more committed to the project of creating the Monster, even if it means contravening the laws of Nature. Krempe tries his best to dissuade him, but the Baron takes no notice; on the contrary, he becomes quite frenzied in his efforts to finish his experiments. Cushing suggests this cleverly through a series of bird-like movements; his body taut, his hands flitting across the instruments and test-tubes that clutter his laboratory.In the end the Baron gets his comeuppance, as he is sent to jail and hanged. But Fisher does not send him to his death without providing a memorable denouement, which does not exist in the source-text but emphasizes the extent to which the Baron's brilliant intelligence has been corrupted by his scientific work.Although only just over eighty minutes long, THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN still has the capacity to startle audiences through its combination of memorable sequences and taut storytelling. Definitely worth repeated viewings.

That observation is partially based on extrapolation as I gave up watching modern horror films for pleasure back in the 1980's, as my pleasure gave way to horror.Baron Frankenstein played by Peter Cushing and his former tutor turned tiresomely unwilling assistant Robert Urquhart bring back to life a composite human being Christopher Lee. Naturally, or maybe not, Lee cuts up rusty and shows ingratitude at such high-handed treatment. With this tale comparisons are inevitable for instance the two versions of the tale written by Mary Shelley are preferable of course, eminently readable if a little dry - the 1818 text for choice; the 1910 film was fascinating and garish; the 1931 and 1935 films were short and entertaining; the 1973 badly dated even on release; while Cushing's Hammer series was excellent, especially if you can leave your brain in a jar by the door. Karloff was the ultimate unforgettable monster - over the decades I've seen too many knuckle dragging yobs looking like Lee haunting (or going by his part in this, simply hanging about outside) my local chipshop to be unsettled by his workmanlike appearance. Colin It's Alive Clive was OK, but not a patch on Cushing who with his performance in this created a bit of a monster for himself too. And who can forget Hazel Court playing Mae Clarke's former role of Elizabeth in a splendid selection of gravity-defying dresses? For saying Hammer ran a tight ship the attention to period detail was very good, as far as I can tell after years of seeing Antiques Roadshow. At the climax with Cushing's histrionics I was bizarrely reminded of such disparate films as A Tale Of Two Cities, Dead Of Night and All Quiet On The Western Front. I've always enjoyed this middlebrow soapy corn and recommend it wholeheartedly to those who already know they like this genre; if you like modern horror you'll probably find you've thrown away your eighty minutes and that you perhaps should've got a life instead.

While this film is not quite on the level of the best of those, it's still an exceptional movie that launched a terrific franchise. Actually, the Frankenstein series at Hammer was the best series they had. Their Dracula series was good but lacking due to Christopher Lee's refusal to return to the part until nearly a decade after the first film. When he finally did, Hammer's most creative period was behind it. There would still be entertaining movies, but nothing on the level of these first ones. One of the most interesting changes in the Hammer series from the Universal movies was the focus on Frankenstein himself as the monster instead of the creature he creates, which changes in almost every movie. Peter Cushing is phenomenal in the part of the unsympathetic, unrepentant villainous Baron Frankenstein. It would prove to be the role of his career and he would play it more than any other part.This is the beginning of Hammer's rejuvenation of the horror genre, which had all but been dead since Universal's last great horror cycle in the '40s. True there had been many movies of the '50s with a horror bent, such as Universal's Creature from the Black Lagoon. But these movies didn't lead to a genre revival like Hammer's films did.

The end of World War II saw horror fall out of fashion, and only House Of Wax bucked the trend and made big-time box-office. Even its semi-follow-ups, Phantom Of The Rue Morgue and The Mad Magician died a death.So the little British studio called Hammer Films, which operated in a genteel atmosphere from a country mansion near the banks of the Thames, re-invented the genre to spectacular effect. Milton Subotsky, he of Amicus Films fame and later a rival to Hammer itself, submitted a shortish script and proposed a 60 minute black and white remake of Frankenstein to star Boris Karloff. Hammer junked the script but ran with the idea (they paid Subotsky royalties). Hammer's production personnel had by this time become a gifted and efficient unit, and Director Terence Fisher was perfect for the first of their Gothic revivals.Curse gave horror fans two new horror stars in Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Cushing dominates the movie with a superb and ironically humorous performance as Baron Frankenstein; indeed most of the film follows Frankenstein's attempts to give life to his creature, squeezing the monster's screen time into approximately the last half-hour.The Hammer Gothic look is wonderfully established here, cinematographer Jack Asher and production designer Bernard Robinson do wonders with a limited budget, producing a garish and utterly convincing sense of period. Blood has never looked more scarlet than in this film.Christopher Lee does well with his much smaller role as the monster, at times appearing to have difficulty in getting his limbs to work, at other times resembling a pathetic and forlorn outsider. The voluptuous Hazel Court lends able support as Frankenstein's fianc√©, and Robert Urqhart channels the spirit of Shelly's novel, futilely trying to make Victor see the great evil he's involved in. But it's Cushing who carries the movie and rightly so. Great acting from a truly great actor.With it's gory moments and shock effects this had a tremendous impact on release and it holds up very well today.

Other liberties are taken with the original story - no nasty digging around a graveyard to get a body, but simply cut one down from the gallows. The idea of Baron Victor (Peter Cushing) cutting off the head was probably more gruesome than actually seeing it done since it forces you to picture how that might have gone.The thing I can't get used to with all the Hammer films I've seen so far is the vibrant use of color. Krempe's (Robert Urquhart) red robe, the Baron's bright green coat, all those lab chemicals in an array of improbable hues. It's one of the hallmarks that makes Hammer, Hammer. I guess it depends what era you were born in and when you started watching horror flicks; I must be conditioned to glorious black and white so all that color seems like sensory overload.As for the story, it holds up pretty well, even if it takes almost fifty minutes for the Monster to make his first appearance. Krempe's disgust with this 'criminal lunatic' leads him to shoot the monster in the face!, which was probably the most shocking thing for me in the whole picture. Christopher Lee of course is superb as the Monster, but you don't get a sense of the angst the creature suffered the way he did in the 1931 Universal version.

However, it was not until this remake of the 1931 Universal classic that Hammer Films truly came into its own.Curse of Frankenstein has all the characteristics that we have since come to expect in a Hammer film. Lots of full-color blood and violence; a stellar cast (headed in this case by Peter Cushing as Victor Frankenstein and Christopher Lee as The Monster); an atmospheric Gothic setting; a rousing musical score; and first-rate production values that belie the low budget.The one disappointment is The Monster himself. Christopher Lee is fine, but his monster has little to do except lumber around and kill people. And he looks more like a horribly disfigured human than the unearthly creature that Boris Karloff created a generation earlier.Hammer would go on to make numerous Frankenstein sequels, all of them without Lee but most with Peter Cushing as the sometimes evil, sometimes not-so-evil Baron. It would follow up the success of Frankenstein with even more successful remakes of Dracula and The Mummy.

Approximately two decades after the immensely popular Universal monster movies, the British Hammer studio gained their first SF/horror success with The Quatermass Experiment. In all honesty, it was the popularity of this, and only this Nigel Kneale adaptation that all of a sudden indicated that the audience's hunger for morbid tales and horrific effects was insatiable and Hammer cleverly exploited this given one step at the time, by re-telling other famous franchises. They begun with Frankenstein in 1957, but Dracula and The Mummy immediately followed during the next years. Terence Fisher's The Curse of Frankenstein revives the basic classic premise of Mary Shelley's story but adds a whole lot of horrific aspects that would later become the typical trademarks of the great Hammer production company. For example, the morality-lesson that nobody is entitled to play God and create life himself is not exaggeratedly obtruded like in most other Frankenstein adaptations and the creature's make-up is really monstrous for the very first time. Although, admittedly, that's also due to the fact that the original monster make up, worn by the legendary Boris Karloff as we all remember him, was copyright protected and simply not allowed to be imitated. But, most of all, Hammer implemented these and other minor modifications because their interpretation of the horror genre clearly was much more brutal, spectacular and hence more appealing to the new generation of fans. Suffice to say the success was immense and sequels to both the Frankenstein and Dracula franchise were released quickly as well as other, entirely new horror tales. For nearly twenty years, Hammer Studios set the tone of pretty much everything that concerned horror in Europe and their influence is still very noticeable to this day. The Curse of Frankenstein stars the legendary Peter Cushing as the obsessive and dangerously devoted Baron/scientist, a role he will reprise several times and perhaps THE role that made him the horror icon he's still regarded as to this day, more than 10 years past his death. The film opens with images of the degraded Baron sitting in a filthy prison cell and begins to clarify his life-story to a priest. Orphanaged at a young age, the wealthy and intellectually gifted Victor Frankenstein works, together with his mentor Dr. Paul Krempe, in the field of re-animating dead tissue and brain activity. Even though the two quickly reach a medical breakthrough, Frankenstein wants to take his experiments to a higher level and creates entirely new life by composing body parts of deceased persons. Since not every part of his ideal creation is available easy (like, for example, an intelligent brain), Frankenstein turns to murder. When Victor Frankenstein commits his first murder, exclusively to foresee his creation with the intelligent brain of a professor, everything changes. He descends into madness without really realizing it and he's no longer able to see the difference between science and insanity. Driven by blind obsession, Victor ruins the friendship between him and Paul and he totally neglects his loving fianc√©e Elizabeth. In a desperate attempt to stop his former friend, Paul damages the brain but still Victor is destined to continue his experiments. The man Frankenstein eventually brings to life is an aggressive monster that looks hideous and doesn't even hesitate to attack his creator. One day, the monster escapes and assaults an elderly blind man, forcing Paul and Victor to destroy the ungodly creature forever....or so Paul thinks. When he returns to Frankenstein's castle several weeks later to attend Victor's wedding to Elizabeth, the Baron proudly informs him that the monster got resurrected yet again and now it even obeys simple commands. Nonetheless, the murderous creation escapes again and this time the consequences won't be dismissed so easily... The priest from the intro can't bring Victor any salvation and the movie ends with the once prominent heir of the Frankenstein fortune walking towards the guillotine... I initially stated that this film isn't really Hammer's finest film. Some of their later horrors (notably The Devil Rides Out, Quatermass and the Pit and also some of the sequels to this very film) look more appealing and more properly elaborated. The budget for Curse of Frankenstein, however, was low and this resulted in occasionally tacky special effects and a lack of diversity in settings. The movie is largely filmed on one location &#150; the Baron's laboratory &#150; simply because there was no money for other decors. The limited budget is also clearly noticeable by the absence of a vast Gothic atmosphere and a modest use of color-shades (there were Hammer is specifically knows for their heavy use of colors). Even though not a very spectacular horror film, The Curse of Frankenstein remains a milestone in the genre, with some great suspense and a truly powerful acting performance by Peter Cushing. This film is legendary for yet another entirely different reason, as it also meant the first of many horror collaborations between Cushing and Christopher Lee! Nineteen, to be exact, including masterful genre highlights like The Creeping Flesh, Horror Express and The House that Dripped Blood. Lee's share in this production is very brief (the creature Frankenstein gives life to) but oh-so-memorable, and his make-up effects still look nightmarish nearly half a century later. It's perhaps not the greatest horror movie ever made but real fans of the genre will have to acknowledge that Curse of Frankenstein is a genuine classic that set a lot of later standards.

There are so many historical reasons that this is an important film. The first, and obvious, being that it was the first color horror film created by Hammer Studios and so launched the studio that would rule Brit horror for more than a decade to follow and change the landscape of the genre. Forgoing its' importance to Hammer, it is also considered by many to have saved horror. By the late 50s ghouls and monsters and the old Gothic horror tradition had passed out of vogue to be replaced by giant creatures and radioactive animals. This movie brought real horror back to the masses in a big way. The last thing I will point out is that the movie had a huge effect on bringing sex into the horror genre. When you think of modern horror, sex and violence seem almost connected. While there were certainly horror movies before this with a sexual tone, Hammer brought it to the forefront and had a big effect.We don't watch movies for historical relevance, though. We watch them for entertainment, so let's get to the nitty gritty. It's hard to review this without the inevitable comparisons to Universal's movie, which I consider to be superior. The biggest change is that this is not a movie about the monster in any way. This is firmly a movie about Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein and he does a phenomenal job. Cushing established his horror rep here in a role playing a man who was not inherently evil, but obsessed with his dream of creating life and never considering the implications. As that dream gets closer to fruition, he is willing to do whatever necessary to fulfill that dream. He is the force that carries this movie, entirely, which is also what makes it less entertaining that Uni's movie, to me. It could have benefited from a little more monster.While we're discussing the monster, he's almost a cardboard caricature here. The makeup is sort of a mess and not as memorable as the Jack Pierce work. It's definitely a scarier look but isn't nearly as iconic. Christopher Lee is given almost nothing to do. The monster has no real personality. He kills because that's what the script needs and there is none of the tragedy of Karloff's role.The look of the movie is fantastic, as with most Hammer. This feels like a Reubens painting come to life, with a vibrant, rich color palette. The sets and costumes are lavish, though the lab is a little more realistic than Colin Clive's lab in the Uni movie and lacks some of the distinction. Hazel Court plays the obligatory beautiful gal and fills that role well.I was trying hard not to compare t the Uni classic, but failed in the end. While it may not be as good as that standard, I still give this a 9 out of 10 because it's still one of greatest horror movies of any era. It's paced well, it's exciting, it features some great acting and it created the Hammer blueprint that would dominate horror.

I loved the fact that Baron Frankenstein is a far darker character than many other adaptations. He's an utterly contemptible and amoral bastard, which makes him an extremely compelling character.As in the Dracula films, Christopher Lee has relatively little screen time but is never less than brilliant as the Creature, communicating a great deal through facial expressions. Hazel Court, Robert Urquhart and Valerie Gaunt were very strong as well, particularly Urquhart. I loved the fact that the ending left it ambiguous as to whether the events of Frankenstein's story actually happened or were just a figment of an imagination, though the existence of sequels would suggest that it did!

Essentially, Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) and his capable assistant Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) are conducting experiments on reanimating dead animals in his laboratory. When they finally achieve their goal Victor wants to continue even further by constructing a human from various body parts while Paul is repulsed by the idea and prefers to publish their findings at an upcoming science conference. To further add to this equation, Victor's attractive cousin Elizabeth (Hazel Court) arrives at the mansion in preparation for their arraigned marriage. Not only is she unaware of the nature of the experiments in the laboratory but she also doesn't know that Victor is involved in a romantic relationship with the maid named Justine (Valerie Gaunt). Like I mentioned earlier, there are several major changes in this story versus the movie that came out in 1931. Anyway, there is more to this movie than what I've just mentioned but rather than disclose anything else and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I will leave it at that. All things considered I liked the performance of Peter Cushing along with the overall ambiance of the movie and the fact that it was filmed in color.

It's a very different film with a very different feel and a very different story. It's also not a bad story - more of a cult classic than a classic, but not bad. This movie - compared to most versions of the story - focuses far more on Baron Frankenstein himself than on the monster, who we really don't see very much of. In the classic '33 version I found the monster to be compelling; very much an object of sympathy; a fascinating psychological story with a lot of similarities to an abused child. Here, the monster was just the monster. With the focus on Frankenstein himself, I felt no real connection with Christopher Lee's take on the creature.Basically, except for the different perspective, the story is the story, although it's told as a flashback. As the movie begins, Frankenstein is in prison awaiting execution, and he pours out his tale to a priest. Frankenstein had assembled a creature from parts of dead bodies, and managed to bring the creature to life. The creature then caused havoc. The good doctor was played by Peter Cushing, in his first pairing with Lee, and instead of a grotesque, hunchbacked assistant, Frankenstein is first helped in his experiments by his handsome former tutor Paul (Robert Urquhart) - who then turns against him. Because this is really more of a look at the obsession of Frankenstein with creating life than with the monster, it's not really a frightening movie. What did intrigue me was the ending. It seems to leave open the question of whether the story Frankenstein has told his jailers is true, or whether it's a figment of his imagination, and it was really Frankenstein who was responsible for the killings that had happened. That did intrigue me as a unique take on the story. It's not as good as the '33 version, but it has some things going for it.

Here we get all those things we associate with Hammer Studios directorial flair and finesse, gobs of Gothic atmosphere, lush cinematography, beautiful sets and costumes, great character acting, and, of course, best of all - Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. This was their first horror film together with Fisher - the start of a beautiful friendship which would last for many, many years. Lee has a rather thankless role here as the monster but shows us why we would see so much more of him later on. Make no mistake though - Hammer would be successful because of this film and its success stood on the shoulders of two men - one in front of the camera the other behind it. Sure the writer Jimmy Sangster did a marvelous job adapting/changing Mary Shelley's classic novel whilst making sure the movie didn't resemble the Universal Frankenstein at all. It had to do that to be anything on its own. Here the monster is the supporting player and the doctor - the real villain of th book - is the protagonist. That transition would not have worked with an actor unable to convince us of his motives, his purely methodical, calculating mind, his endless ambition and desire to discover a new scientific pathway to the secret of life, a God-complex so completely shrouded over him yet ever so subtly revealed. The man that was able to do that was Peter Cushing, an actor who gets lost in the annals of great actors because he chose horror to shine in rather than mainstream films where he undoubtedly could have been more successful. I don't think I have ever seen Cushing give a bad performance. Here he excels and plays Baron Victor Frankenstein with all those aforementioned qualities with workmanlike zeal. Cushing is the epitome of the class act actor. He defined this role and knew that the doctor must be the real catalyst to the action in the film. He reprised this role in six of the seven total Frankenstein films in the Hammer cycle. The other man is Terence Fisher who makes all this discussion possible. Fisher knew how to put a film together, to make it exciting, interesting, fresh, and still Gothic. When you watch a Fisher film it is easy to tell the difference between his work and the other Hammer directors. I cannot always put my finger on it but Fisher's films have something more. The Curse of Frankenstein has stirring music by James Bernard. It has solid character acting - a trademark of almost all Hammer films. The lovely Hazel Court does ably in a thankless role as Elizabeth and Robert Urquhart is very effective as a rather important character friend/foil to the Baron. While Curse may not be the very best Hammer horror film nor my personal favourite, it is easily one of the best, and what it achieved in giving us Cushing, Lee, and Fisher as well as the Hammer horror style makes it tops in my book.

I don't fully realize why Krempe would stay there AND act that way, considering he had initiated Victor to that kind of things. The rest of the characters are minor, rather stereotypical and not worth mentioning. SFX are decent, but not particularly worth of mention. Atmosphere is good old Victorian and suits Cushing so well.

Rather than try to reinvent the Universal classic of 1931 and despite toying with the idea of a cheap black and white quicky featuring Boris Karloff, Hinds and Sangster returned to the source material after rejecting Subotsky and Rosenberg's script (although elements of their outline did remain in the final film) and fashioned what initially appeared to be a kind of gory comedy. Some ideas were accepted, others rejected, rewrites and reinventions flourished until finally, under Terence Fisher's skilled direction, the company produced what is, without doubt, their most important film; 'The Curse of Frankenstein'. While it may not be their greatest production, it is unquestionably their most influential in terms of their output over the next decade and a half. Peter Cushing's performance as Baron Victor Frankenstein is flawless, the depth perhaps only becoming truly evident after viewing the entire series of Hammer Frankenstein movies (not including the unfortunate 'Horror of Frankenstein' which mistakenly returned to the comedic notion with hugely dissatisfying results and which featured Ralph Bates in Cushing's role) in which the character's evolution and development become chillingly clear. Christopher Lee actually gives a tremendous performance as the creature, a performance which, like Fisher's work, has not been properly evaluated but one which elevates his creature to a status almost equal to Karloff's and certainly light years ahead of all other competition. He understands that the creature is seriously brain damaged and his mime reveals both danger and pathos as the creature shambles through its short half life, virtually a grotesque projection of the Baron's warped mind. Despite being largely derided by the snobby film critics of the time, the film went on to make a significant impact at the box office and is now regarded as a classic, and justifiably so. A must see for horror fans.

The maintaining of a dark mood, the increasing freight, the complete lack of any comic relief, the asides of sex and deceit, the steady build in excitement, both with music and action - this is where it first happened. All the arts of film making were crafted to bring to the screen a totally new kind of entertainment, such that, even today in 2007, all successful horror films can be found to contain its basic structure. It is for this reason that the film still holds up for the modern viewer. The gore comes forth if full color, but without being a blood fest, unlike the less tasteful B horror films of the day, and the onslaught of barf-bag blood fests the engorged film goers of the late sixties and seventies (it is sad to say that such gore fests are still produced today). The cold villainy in Cushing's Victor Frankenstein has a edge to it - we stay with him and agree with him, but we also stand clear of him, as he might value our brain, or our limbs. His performance is such that a teenage viewer might not ever see him as all that bad, while an adult will clearly see that he is a dangerous person. That is to say, Cushing shows evil the way it really is in the world, and he was going to do this a good number of times throughout his career. Also - this film retained many important story elements of Mary Shelly's classic novel, but meets the middle ground by not being too literal and boring us to death (a major problem with some of the recent film adaptations). This is a Must-See, as are all of the early Hammer films. Indeed, try to see this and the excellent sequel Revenge of Frankenstein back to back. Together, they tell a well rounded tale of literatures most famous maker of monsters. It should be noted that Hammer retold the Frankenstein story a number of times, so that their series is not always sequential. The Evil of Frankenstein, though still staring Peter Cushing, is a different Victor Frankenstein altogether, with its own telling of the monster's creation, and is more on the formula of the old Universal series (a step backward in my opinion, but still an entertaining film).

This movie is mostly lacking emotional depth and the movie is clearly made merely to entertain. And the movie serves its purpose. Although it makes far from a lasting impression. it's a movie with some good and memorable moments nevertheless. It makes The Curse of Frankenstein a pretty interesting take on the Mary Shelley novel, with still some of the key novel elements present but for most part this movie is a very free interpretation of the famous novel, that takes lots of liberties.The movie at point might be perhaps a bit too slow and the movie lacks some true scares or suspenseful moments. This is mainly because the movie underused the creature. The creature gets very little to do and unlike other Frankenstein movies, this movie mostly focuses only on Baron Frankenstein. The baron is not yet a fully developed character in this movie. Throughout the movie he and his motivations change which makes it for the viewer perhaps a bit hard to follow the movie and care about the character. Also Peter Cushing isn't at his best yet in his role as the baron. It seems like he was still searching for the right way to portray the characters. Luckily he got it right in the other Hammer studio's Frankenstein movies.Still this movie is a bit of a historical classic for several reasons. One of them is that I believe(?) that this was Peter Cushing's first appearance in an Hammer film and it's the fist teaming up of Cushing and Lee in an horror film. Much more, some successful, other not so but yet always fun and entertaining to watch, would follow in the years after.Like mentioned earlier. Christopher Lee doesn't really get enough screen time. He enters the movie perhaps a bit too late and he doesn't get lots of interesting to do. Also his strange white make-up is far from convincing. I remember in one scene you could also see his neck as well, where clearly no make-up was attached to. It makes this movie perhaps a bit like a B-monster movie but still the movie is uplifted mainly by Peter Cushing's presence. Even though he isn't at 'full strength' as baron Frankenstein, he still puts down a believable obsessed and brilliant doctor, who goes too far. Also Robert Urquhart is quite good and likable in his role.The movie is at times a bit too simple and features a bit too many ridicules scene's and moments to consider this a classic. It's not halve as good or memorable as the earlier Universal studio's Frankenstein movies but still this movie has plenty of good and entertainment to offer. It's also an original take and attempt and it deserves credit for not trying to be better than the earlier Frankenstein movies but choices to be simple and therefor more entertaining instead.

Filming the book however has always been notoriously difficult, but of the numerous screen adaptations and variations of the tale, this one for me, despite its small budget and minimal approach, is the best. This is sacrilege perhaps, since it's not particularly faithful to the book - it throws tons of stuff out, adds the rather pedestrian linking character of Paul and the unnecessary subplot with Justine the maid, misrepresents the creature, bookends the narrative and changes the ending. Yet despite all this I still feel it's the best distillation of the story; the experiments in the lab, the graverobbing, the birth of the creature and its disastrous aftermath - but most importantly in the persona of Cushing as Frankenstein. Some actors are simply in the right place at the right time, as is the case here. His performance is mesmerisingly brilliant - it's very hard to play this type of material without overdoing it (the principal flaw in James Whale's equally stunning 1931 version) and yet still portray the intensity and single-mindedness so crucial to the plot. Cushing is the Villain of Villains, somehow so attractive in his intelligence and passion but also revoltingly sinister in his callous disregard for anything other than his work. If you learn nothing else about Frankenstein, always remember that both the name and the monster in the story refer to the scientist, not the creature he creates (which is both innocent and nameless), and Cushing simply is Frankenstein. The supporting cast are all good, particularly cult favourite Court as the basque-bursting Elizabeth (don't miss her in Roger Corman's The Raven and The Masque Of The Red Death), and of course Lee in a career-making part as the horrific yet pitiable subject of Frankenstein's endeavours. This film was an enormous hit on its release, both in Europe and the US, and formed the basis for the famous Hammer Films series of horror movies. It also brought together a great production crew - director Fisher, writer Jimmy Sangster, cameraman Jack Asher, editor James Needs, composer James Bernard, designer Bernard Robinson and producer Anthony Hinds amongst others - who went on to make many great little films throughout the sixties. There are lots of straight movie versions of this great story, and a thousand variations; everything from The Rocky Horror Picture Show to Bicentennial Man. Almost all of them are interesting and explore the rich themes in Shelley's extraordinary book, but this one somehow captures the essence of it with the greatest purity. Cushing was one of the best actors the UK has ever produced, and his performance in this role stands head and shoulders above all the others.

It is also the first pairing of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, two guys you have a hard time NOT seeing in the same film.The movie deserves kudos for making the true monster not the creature, but Frankenstein himself. (After all, we frequently call the creature Frankenstein, and not the man who invented him.) The horror element is truly focused on Cushing as the mad doctor. The monster is almost an afterthought. (It wouldn't be until the Dracula movies that Lee became a star in his own right.) Victor is truly evil in this film because he believes the ends justify the means. (Life never should work that way. The means should justify the ends.) Even as he kills a noted scholar in his house to harvest his brain, he has no remorse for what he is doing. (Compare to the Colin Clive Frankenstein, who is really nothing more than a glorified grave robber.) He kills the maid Justine and his own unborn child in order to cover his secret, a crime he pays for with a death sentence. (Commuted in the sequel.)

It was certainly interesting to see Cushing playing a man in the prime of life instead of the spry, silver-haired intellectuals of his later career; but unfortunately this was probably the least enjoyable Hammer I've seen so far.I think the main problem -- and this may be an entirely personal reaction -- was that there simply wasn't the necessary tug of sympathy for the characters present in so much of Cushing's later work, even the minor shockers from the Seventies like 'Legend of the Werewolf' or 'The Ghoul'. This Baron von Frankenstein is not merely an obsessive blinded to the potential outcome of his work; he's a cold-blooded seducer who manipulates his low-born mistress to her death, kills a man in order to obtain his his brain for the Creature and blackmails his friend with threats to his own fianc√©e.On the other hand, the servant girl Justine -- in a confusing and surely unnecessary plot twist -- attempts to get the Baron to marry her by the convoluted method of getting herself pregnant by another man, supposedly his moral superior (but she still wants to marry Frankenstein). Cousin Elizabeth spends all her time trying to get him to give up his research to prove his devotion, and Victor's former best friend washes his hands of all responsibility but can't take his eyes off his friend's fianc√©e for long enough to bring himself to leave the shelter of his roof. The Creature itself is a homicidal lunatic that murders without apparent reason or intelligence and can evoke no more sympathy than its creator -- how such a limiting and limited role could have proved an asset to Christopher Lee's career seems something of a puzzle.The musical score, which I had heard praised, appeared to have little distinction or subtlety, simply telegraphing every move before it was made, and the off-stage peasants, commended for their ingenious budget-saving non-appearance, were absent beyond even the promised torchlight reflection. Conspicuous by their intrusion, however, were the blind man and his grandson, whose sole purposes in life were to be menaced and murdered by the Creature (apparently without consequence) and who aroused a good deal of unfortunate giggling in the auditorium.There is a good deal of play with body parts, acid baths, and the like, which may have thrown out a challenge to the censor but is not in itself horrific. Indeed, as presented, it becomes rather difficult to sympathies with Paul's violent moral revulsion of feeling and insistence that the work will inevitably lead to evil, and his constant nagging comes across as merely unattractive. As a horror film, it derives its few terrors from stock situations like the underclad woman alone in the dark room with an unseen menace, and these, like the blind man scene, are largely robbed of their effectiveness by being over-milked. Considered as a story in its own right, it fails to elevate its characters beyond the one-dimensional or to capitalise on the ironic potential of the various conflicts e.g. it is Paul's actions that create the disaster he is claiming to prevent, and Elizabeth is bound by gratitude to one man but attracted to the other.The most horrific scene for me was the merely human drama at the end, where Paul deliberately lies in order to condemn his friend to death. (For what, it is never made clear. I'd assumed it was for the accidental shooting of Elizabeth while attempting to hit the Creature on the roof, but she is subsequently revealed as alive and well.) But since I suspect this was supposed to be regarded in the light of righteous justice catching up with the Baron to provide the moral to the tale, I doubt that the revulsion of this scene can be laid to the screenplay's credit. The whole relationship between the two had potential that was largely ignored in favour of simplistic carping.In my experience, the late Hammer horrors like 'Hands of the Ripper' tended to have a humanity and style that compensated for special effects on the cheap. 'Curse of Frankenstein', for all its financial success, suggests to me that they hadn't yet established their winning formula.

So gasps Peter Cushing as Baron Frankenstein, as he infuses the spark of life into a creature previously dead. On this occasion, it is a puppy used as an experiment. Cushing, taking over from Melvyn Hayes (as the younger Baron), makes the part instantly his own. Every flicker of the eye, every movement, every sideward glance is meticulously measured &#x96; a trait of Cushing's acting, and one of the reasons he has been admired over the years by fans and fellow cast and crew members. As 'Curse of Frankenstein' starts, its credits intoned over swirling red smoke, Frankenstein is dishevelled and desperate, imprisoned for his foul deeds and a cert for the guillotine &#x96; his story is told in flashback.This was Hammer's first major success, the Mary Shelley novel condensed by writer Jimmy Sangster (but not as much as Dracula was the following year). Robert Urquhart, who played Paul Krempe, Frankenstein's tutor, walked out of the premiere, and in disgust gave an interview slating its horrific nature; needless to say, he never appeared in another cinematic film for Hammer. He was not alone &#x96; 'revolting, degrading, pathetic and depressing' are four words amongst many scathing reviews of 'Curse of Frankenstein' upon its release, usually from the prissy pens of the British critics. Happily, the film made seventy times the money that was needed to make it, which tells its own story.Goat's eyes, severed hands and heads, and Cushing's blood spattered lapels certainly brought 'Curse' a huge level of notoriety upon its release which fuelled its popularity and put Hammer forever on the map &#x96; as well as making stars out of both Cushing, and his 'creature' Christopher Lee (a role for which Bernard Bresslaw was also considered). Lee was chosen mainly for his height and smothered in car-crash make-up and an obvious wig, which provides an effective scare but is hardly memorable in the way that Jack Pierce's make-up had been for the Universal original. It is unfair to compare the two films however &#x96; they were made in a different age for a different audience - and that is the last time I shall do so.The few wisps of humour in this doom-laden story are provided by The Baron's affair with maid Justine, who naively believes his lies and tried to blackmail him, and another scene which involves The Baron politely asking for the marmalade during a genteel breakfast directly after the scene in which he locks Justine into his filthy laboratory with his reborn creature.The Creature has a magnificent introduction. Left in an emptying water tank, with its chest heaving, there is a crash which leads Frankenstein to scurry into his deserted laboratory. There stands his creation, uncoordinated arms and hands reaching to rip away the bandages covering his face. Phil Leakey's make-up is revealed, and the creature (or rather the late Professor Bernstein, whose brain is in the monster's head) immediately recognises the man who originally killed him and reaches out to strangle him. No mild-mannered monster, he still invites a kind of sympathy &#x96; in the way a rabid dog would invite sympathy for its plight, if not for its temperament.At the finale, we return to The Baron's incarceration, with Frankenstein facing the guillotine after his last hope, Paul Krempe, has wilfully failed to save him. Krempe is hardly as virtuous as he seems, I think. For all his gallant protection of Frankenstein's intended Elizabeth (Hazel Court), it is clear he has designs on her &#x96; by the film's end, he happily places an arm around her as he escorts her out of Frankenstein's cell.

The main thing here is that the film is just really boring for the main part of its running time and doesn't offer up much of anything throughout the entire first hour that gives this any kind of feeling about being a horror film. Though it nicely runs through the begging phase of the novel where he begins his research on human anatomy and the limits of science in that time period, these here don't make the connection that his drive to complete these experiments so they make no sense and instead render him into a state of madness performing these actions without that base. He simply comes off as a raving lunatic doing horrible atrocities simply because he wanted to, making for quite the unappealing supposed hero. This also manages another big flaw here in making the film feel so much like a period drama about a scientist keeping his friends and lover away from his work, and there's so many scenes here that feature this from their conversations about the abomination they've created, the growing threats to notify the authorities of his work or the need to procure the remaining parts here that there's barely any time with the actual creature on-screen who only has so little screen-time the pace is altered dramatically slower than what it should be and appears much longer than it really is. These facets here lower this one so significantly that even the few positives here aren't that appealing. The film's biggest virtue here is that the creature's time here is fun makes it worthwhile, getting the initial early resurrection in the laboratory, a great stalking in the forest where it hunts the travelers lost in the area before the two tracking it catch up to it, and the centerpiece attack at the end which is a nice action scene here with the creature stalking their friend and forcing some decent action to rescue her that ends with some solid Gothic action quite nicely. What really gives these a lot of their big impact is the grisly and genuinely haunting make-up work here which is really shocking with how this one goes about portraying the creation which here looks even more likely as a walking, stitched together corpse with all the sutures and cutting marks across the fact that it creates a shocking look. The last positive here is the decision to streamline the first half, as while it makes the actions here way too problematic being forced through all that would've been torture on the pace with the way it is already in here. Still, the flaws here are way to detrimental to save this one.Today's Rating/PG Violence.

Krempe assists at first, but he withdraws following the scavenging of human remains to put this new body together, the body parts of this creature are assembled from a hanged robber's corpse, with hands and eyes purchased from charnel house workers, but for the brain Victor wants one with a lifetime of knowledge. With difficulty in finding a brain by practical methods Victor invites ageing and distinguished Professor Bernstein (Paul Hardtmuth) to the house, and in a moment of madness he pushes him from a staircase, it appears like an accident to others, after the burial Victor goes to the vault and back to his laboratory, but Krempe finds out what he did, there is a scuffle and the brain is damaged.

While Krempe leaves town, Victor digs up the body and revives the monster, he uses it to murder his housemaid Justine (Valerie Gaunt), whom he had been having an affair with, she was threatening to tell the authorities about his strange experiments.

Audiences had become accustomed to the various tropes and were ready for something new. Into this void stepped Hammer Studios with their first foray into Gothic Horror with 'The Curse of Frankenstein' (1957) and to keep it fresh offered the viewers unprecedented levels of gore in its unabashed depiction of various body parts and people (well, the creature) getting shot in the face. What's more, the choice to film in vivid colour made everything so much more visceral. On the strength of this, Horror was resurrected and brought over to England where Hammer continued their run of films and the careers of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and director Terence Fisher were launched into the stratosphere.However, the film is not perfect. Sure the performances are solid, with Peter Cushing giving a characteristically convincing performance as Dr. Frankenstein, a man whose devotion to his work overrides all else&#x85;including the laws of nature. What's more, the opulent production design (made more impressive by Hammer's famously low budgets) creates a real sense of another era and Hammer Staple James Bernard provides a score by turns atmospheric and dramatic&#x85;as he would also do in 'Horror of Dracula' (1958) and many others. And yet, the film lacks a certain punch. It starts off great by establishing character and place, but then fails to develop any real suspense and relies on a few plot-holes to take the film where it needs to go. Perhaps, this is due to screenwriter Jimmy Sangster having to make sure that there no similarities to the Universal production due to threatened legal action. This said, comparisons are inevitable and a major point of difference between the Universal and Hammer productions is the treatment of the creature in the Universal film (similar to the book, although both films take little from Mary Shelly's novel) the creature is the victim and the audience is made to feel sympathy with him. In contrast, the Hammer portrayal is more of a one-dimensional psycho monster. Moreover, even though it was always going to be difficult (if not impossible) to outdo the iconic import of James Whale's 1931 classic, the film is short on pop-culture clout in offering no discernible money shot in the way, say 'Horror of Dracula' has the famous jumping-off-the-table-tearing-the-curtain-down scene.This being said, maybe it is unfair to compare the film so unfavourably to later Hammer Classics as 'Curse of Frankenstein' is not a bad film by any means. It is entirely watchable throughout and its quintessential Hammer characteristics make it recommended viewing to anyone with a taste for the Gothic world of Hammer Horror or, indeed, anyone who wishes to get acquainted with it.

I knew Christopher Lee was Dracula, but didn't know he was also the Frankenstein monster. Having seen the famed 1931 version, I was interested in seeing Hammer's take on the story.Hammer presents Dr. Frankenstein (played, of course, by Peter Cushing) as more villainous than previous incarnations; not actively setting out to do harm, but completely amoral, driven solely by science. He is blind to the grotesque nature of his new project, and resorts to murder to find his ideal brain. He has, with him (and against him), not Igor but a handsome and intelligent scientist named Paul. After tutoring Frankenstein, Paul breaks with him over his experiment, judging it against nature, and warns no good will come of it. He's meant to be the good guy and voice of reason; he soon becomes something like a broken record, harping on about evil and hanging around longer than needed.I was kind of hoping the monster would tear Paul limb from limb; he doesn't, and in fact we don't see much of the monster killing anyone. His killings are largely implied, but still effective in establishing his sense of menace. It's really Dr. Frankenstein who is the movie's true monster.

It was not, in this case, any attempt to make one better than Whale's 1931 classic.The Curse of Frankenstein is a surprising echo of the original, and that's part of the fun watching it, seeing what was changed, what was enhanced. There some familiar scenes handled differently, like the blind man part, and there are some necessary repetitions made with less flair, like giving life to the monster.

The monster was played by his best friend, Christopher Lee.The movie is creaky, for sure. Its effects are fine, but the seams are showing. The bit parts are unconvincing at times, and the script is a bit stiff. But then, a Hammer Horror film can't be too good or it wouldn't also be awful, and this is one of the classics. Hammer managed six sequels to this one (a testament to its success) and Cushing is in five of those. Most consider this one the best, and it's the place to start, for sure.

For starters, it was the first Frankenstein adaptation to be filmed in color. Secondly, it was a huge international hit that not only became the most successful British film of its time but also helped establish Hammer Productions as one of the world's premiere studios specializing in fantasy, science fiction and horror - a title it would retain for the next twenty years. Third, it (along with Hammer's follow-up hit HORROR OF DRACUL A) made stars out of leads Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, whose names would become synonymous with the genre. And finally, it helped to usher in a return to Gothic horror after years of atomic age sci-fi films (dealing with alien invasions, giant monsters, etc.) that dominated the early part of the decade. Furthermore, the film also upped the ante in on-screen gruesomeness.In a mountainous village in Switzerland sometime in the 19th Century, Victor Frankenstein (Cushing) is being held in an asylum, and narrates his own story about how he ended up there. After inheriting the Frankenstein fortune upon his parent's death, young Victor decides to hire live-in tutor Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) to school him in science. After years of study, the two men begin experimenting in bringing the dead back to life, starting with successfully reviving a puppy. Not quite satisfied with that, Victor (with assistance from an increasingly reluctant Paul) decides to move on to experimenting with human corpses. They acquire the dead body of a hulking burglar from the gallows, bring his body back to the lab and discover birds have rendered much of the body unusable. Victor then sets out to find replacement parts, starting with getting the hands from a newly-dead sculptor. Meanwhile, Victor's lovely cousin Elizabeth (Hazel Court) shows up to make good on a marriage arranged during her youth. Little does she know, but Victor is already carrying on an affair with household maid Justine (Valerie Gaunt), and plans to continue doing so regardless of his engagement.Realizing things have taken a decidedly wrong turn, Paul chooses to quit assisting in the experiments and tries to encourage Elizabeth (whom he has grown fond of) to leave, but she refuses. Victor keeps acquiring body parts in Charnel houses and such, but when it comes down to getting the right brain for his creation, he's reduced to murdering a brilliant scientist (Paul Hardtmuth) to get it. During a scuffle with Paul, the brain is damaged but Victor decides to use it anyway and finally his creation is complete. Lightning strikes and soon the strong hulking creation (Lee) is brought to life.From top to bottom, this is a professionally done production. It's well directed by British horror king Terence Fisher, has convincing period detail and boasts an excellent central performance from Cushing, as well as very good supporting ones from Urquhart and Court. Lee himself has just minimal screen-time, but still manages to make an impression as the creature. However, the role itself is more one-dimensional than what we'd previously seen in Boris Karloff's portrayal in the original FRANKENSTEIN films. Other notable contributions come from composer James Bernard, cinematographer Jack Asher, production design and art direction from Ted Marshall and Bernard Robinson and costumes by Molly Arbuthnot. The film is quite grisly at times, with a decapitation, severed hands, eyeballs, brains, a shotgun blast to the face and a fiery finale. The pale green make-up design on the creature (conceived by Philip Leakey) gives the creature a more zombie-like appearance than previously seen in other adaptations.Despite being executed at the end of the film, Cushing's mad scientist returned again (albeit under the name Victor Stein) in THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN the following year, as well as many other sequels for Hammer, lasting until 1974's FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL.

Along with Van Helsing, the diabolical scientist Frankenstein was one of Cushing's iconic characters. Unlike the Universal series which veered somewhat away from the creator towards the creation, Hammer studios remain completely focused on Cushing's scientist and how, time and again, he'd oftentimes succeed in his experiments regarding the reanimating of dead life, only to be thwarted by events out of his control. I have never cared much for make-up artist Ashton's work because often the monsters' faces created from Frankenstein's hands look like putty. Unlike Karloff's monster, Lee's creature is basically an uncontrollable killer, strangling anyone in his path. Lee, as always, cuts an ominous figure on screen, but his performance of the monster makes him pitiful, homicidal, and confused. The true evil creature is Frankenstein himself, and we see the lengths he'll go to see his work go unharmed, and will do whatever it takes to achieve in creating a superior being..whether it's killing an elder genius for his brain, pay a penniless sculptor for his hands, or murder a jilted lover/maid-servant when she threatens to expose him. In this first Frankenstein film, Cushing's scientist doesn't have a demented hunchback assistant..a constant in the Hammer series, unlike the Universal features that inspired it, is that Cushing often works with ideologically minded young men eager to gain knowledge by assisting Frankenstein. But, almost always, despite the breakthroughs Frankenstein achieves, his creations fall apart/are destined for failure due to various problems such as miscalculations, public/law enforcement/scientific & religious community, and fate. He continues on despite the wreckage left in his wake towards others. Robert Urquhart is Paul Krempe, Frankenstein's tutor, who collaborated with him for many years on a series of experiments regarding the reanimation of the dead, only to question his pupil's morals and lack of emotions in regards to his methods to gain success in creating life. The voluptuous, well-endowed, and lovely Hazel Court is Victor's cousin/fianc√© Elizabeth who always plays second fiddle to Frankenstein's experiments, wishing to spend time with him as the scientist remains in his laboratory endless hours. Paul considers his pupil mad and believes Liz could be in grave danger due to Frankenstein's willingness to achieve at any cost. Paul is privy to Victor's activities. The Frankenstein series fluctuates in quality from film to film, dividing Hammer fans on which is best. Whether other films in this series are better, The Curse of Frankenstein was the first and we have benefited thanks to it's success. Cushing ably portrays him with different facets of emotion..he's determined(..too determined in fact), strong-willed, confident, stubborn, unapologetic, cruel, cunning, intelligent, and even cocky. Perhaps the major flaw of the overall series is how Cushing's Frankenstein often changes from film to film. He's actually friendly, considerate and sad at times, while purely evil and vindictive as well. Cushing shifts his scientist to fit whatever story his character is plunged into. I'd say the Frankenstein series was far more imaginative and daring than the Hammer Dracula films, which could become familiar and repetitive. Similar to the Universal series, the monster is often used and abused, despite Lee's menace, there's still a degree of sadness we feel for him, particularly when his brain has been tampered with again, barely able to walk upright or understand Frankenstein's instructions clearly. The monster's treatment in the series might be a weakness for major fans of the Universal films with Karloff, since barely, at any time, do those under the make-up and costume, have a chance to express the pathos needed(..except maybe Revenge of Frankenstein where a new creature is developed at the request of a hideous hunchback desiring an Adonis' body only for the experiment to fail, as always).

While both deviate from the book (as do the Universal classics), it's more tolerable when dealing with Frankenstein.What mostly makes this film a rousing success is the late, great Peter Cushing in the title role. He's the best Dr. Frankenstein for me, a role which he would improve on as this series progressed. The emphasis in this movie is on the DOCTOR, not the creature, and Cushing is so deliciously obsessed and limitless in his experiments that our interest never wanes, monster or no monster.As for the creature, it really takes second seat to Cushing, and as played by Christopher Lee it is not very memorable. Lee is a fine actor, but he fails to do much with a limited character (though the makeup is an interesting diversion from the Karloff look).I love those mounting tensions between Frankenstein and his righteous collaborator, Paul (did you ever notice that most males in the Hammer series are called either Paul or Hans?)This film was a milestone for the horror industry. When it arrived, Hammer was on the map and its liberal use of bright colors and blood would set the stage for things to come. It's one of Hammer's finest, and not to be missed.

I don't think this film measures up to that one because it doesn't have the suspense, nor does it have the atmosphere a Frankenstein movie should possess.......but it does have a great performance by Cushing. He is the show here, make no mistake.What was weird was that monster didn't look much like a monster. They didn't do much in the makeup department in this film. Maybe that's more realistic as I never did understand why the monster had to have this huge forehead, etc. Heck, here the monster looked more like Keith Richard of the Rolling Stones, or even Mick Jagger, with big acne problems. He wasn't a bad looking guy and certainly didn't deserve the abuse he took (the monster, not the Stones.) The ending of this movie is very unsatisfying, not that any of the Frankenstein movies have a happy ending, but this was particularly unappealing to me.

One of the biggest problems is that the movies all tend to spend too much time on how the creature is created (it was barely mentioned in the book). The other is that the fundamental moral question posed in the book is also often absent (the guilt of the doctor for creating and then abandoning his creation). Instead, films focus almost voyeuristically at the creature's actions. This movie isn't quite as bad in this regard, because the monster is not the mass-murdering creature he is in some versions and the doctor is truly a bad man! Peter Cushing plays a strange Dr. Frankenstein in that this time he is very willing to commit murders himself to further his work plus he is a selfish user (having impregnated and then killing his housekeeper). This is no kindly man wanting to help humanity--instead it's all about glory and a desire to play god.The monster is the least traditional monster I've seen in a very long time. Instead of looking like Karloff, Christopher Lee looks like a combination of a person and a festering piece of blue cheese!! This isn't necessarily a bad thing--the monster was supposed to look pretty bad and her certainly does! However, this cheesy guy never really is allowed to do all that much damage to the populace--and spends most of the movie confined to Frankenstein's castle.I think that the best part of the film is actually its conclusion. I don't want to spoil it, but thought it was great that it brought up a lot of questions as to what really occurred. This vagueness I really liked because I am sure that people will be debating this for some time and I love endings that are open to multiple interpretations.

He is not evil but utterly amoral, unconcerned with the theological implications of his work.Given its qualification of being foremost a potboiler, this is quite a good film with some cool ideas in Jimmy Sangster's script and an excellent performance by Peter Cushing as Viktor Frankenstein.

It's a bit more faithful to Mary Shelley's novel than Universal's 1931 version.  Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) with the help of an unwilling assistant (Robert Urquhart) creates a human being out of the parts of various dead bodies.  Unfortunately the brain used is damaged and the creature (Christopher Lee) is a homicidal maniac.  He escapes and...you can figure out the rest.I saw this originally on late night TV in the mid 1970s.  Back then, I found it frightening and the scene in which the creature is shot in the face, unbelievably bloody.  Seeing it today, I'm not the least bit scared.  The blood and violence which seemed so extreme back then is now very tame.  But childhood memories don't fade and I still remember being scared way back then.  I think an adult or teenager seeing it today would be bored silly.  Still, it IS a classic horror film for introducing Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein which made him a household name, and giving us one of the first bloody horror films.  Still this is in no way a great film.  It's slow (even at 83 minutes) and the creature doesn't even show up until almost an hour in.  Still, it's not too bad.The acting helps.  Cushing is just perfect as the doctor.  You see his obsession and, in a way, understand it.  Urquhart is also very good playing the moral conscience of the doctor.  Lee doesn't make much of an impression as the creature.  His unmasking still does provide a jolt but he's lost under mounds of makeup.  He was much better in 1958's Horror of Dracula.  Hazel Court (a wonderful actress) is shamefully wasted as Elizabeth--but she DOES look fantastic and has some beautiful costumes.  It's also kind of fun to see Valerie Gaunt attacked by Lee here--a year later he went after her again in the Dracula film!  Supposedly she only made those two film--I guess Lee scared her away )  Also the film looks great with some very lush settings and costumes.  So, it's a must-see for the horror fan and even for those who want to see some great acting by Cushing.My only complaint--every single print of this (since the 1970s!) is in washed-out color.  When is Warner Brothers going to strike a new print?  It's about time!

All starred Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, who would go on to become household names on both sides of the ocean. Cushing plays Victor Frankenstein who with his teacher and friend, Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) experiment on restoring life to dead animals. When Frankenstein announces that he is ready to create a living being from dead bodies, Krempe balks. Frankenstein decides to go it alone and in his madness, resorts to murder to obtain the materials that he needs to complete his work. Meanwhile, his fiance Elizabeth (Hazel Court) arrives and is used by Frankenstein to unknowingly aid him in the pursuit of his goals, in spite of warnings to the contrary by Paul. During a malfunction in the laboratory, the assembled creature (Christopher Lee) comes to life and escapes into the forest. He is thought to have been killed, but the ingenious mad man re-creates him and he again runs amok. The film was made in color, a practice that had largely not been followed up to that time for horror films. It worked. The public ate it up and the rest as they say, is history. Both Cushing and Lee injected new life into their careers by playing assorted roles, often together, in the Hammer films over the next 20 years. Followed by several sequels.

In this movie, Dr. Frankenstein is more evil than the monster, committing murder to get the brain he needs, which then makes the monster seem superfluous.

It's well done. Good production value for what was considered a low budget film in its day, although you can occasionally see heavy wooden doors/walls wobble.The thing that drags the film down is the endless dialog.

Frankenstein goes on to say how he hired a teacher named Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) who taught him medical science, after years of experiments they developed a way to reanimate the dead. Frankenstein says that Paul was excited & says that they could save innumerable lives but that he wanted more, he wanted to create the perfect human being using spare body parts & bring them back to life...This British production was directed by Terence Fisher & is the film which the anglo horror period that flourished during the 60's & early 70's can be traced back to, The Curse of Frankenstein & the following year's Dracula/Horror of Dracula (1958) were the films which put Hammer Studios on the map as it were & features many distinctive traits that Hammer films would become synonymous with. From their famous literary sources to the rich English Gothic & Victorian period settings to the glaring Technicolour (most horror films up to that point were shot in black and white) to several key production team personnel like Peter Cushing & Christopher Lee in front of the camera & director Terence Fisher, writer Jimmy Sangster, musician James Bernard & producers Anthony Nelson-Keys, Anthony Hinds & Michael Carreras. The Curse of Frankenstein was the beginning of an era & set the template countless other films would try to imitate. The script by Jimmy Sangster doesn't hang around with the film clocking in at under 80 minutes, I would expect just about everyone to know the basic Frankenstein story & this is surely one of the finest adaptations of Mary Shelley's novel of which there have been more than a few. It's economic & simple yet still layered with various messages & subtle commentary about when the abilities, power & knowledge medical science & doctors have stop & when they start playing god. Baron Frankenstein here is painted as quite the coldly cynical villain having an affair, murdering people & his friends, lying & showing little or no remorse about anything or anyone. The film seems a little slow at times but it all builds up to a satisfying conclusion, the character's are good if somewhat familiar & the actual story is pretty timeless with this being one of the very best adaptations of it. A great film although while it did tick all the right boxes it didn't manage to work me up that much or really get me going, I sat there a bit too impassively & not being affected by what was happening that much for my liking.Director Fisher does a fine job here considering the budget for this must have been tiny, it certainly looks the part with sumptuous Victorian production design, props, costumes & sets by another Hammer regular Bernard Robinson. My only real gripe is that despite living in a huge castle we only ever see three rooms which is more down to budget I would say than ambition. The Curse of Frankenstein was shot in colour & back in 1957 & was probably quite shocking, these days it's not far off a PG with almost no blood or gore. There's a pair of severed hands, a few frames of a decapitated head, some blood splatter & an eyeball. Apparently more explicit scenes might have been filmed for overseas distribution but these have never surfaced so I will believe it when I see them. Since Universal still held the rights to the traditional Boris Karloff Frankenstein monster make-up Hammer were forced to come up with their own design & in fairness it looks like a bit of a mess at times although strangely this is quite effective since the monsters face is meant to be scarred anyway. At times I actually thought it looked more like a zombie with it's pale skin colour, moans & it's slow shuffling walk with outstretched arms!With a supposed budget of about ¬£65,000 the production team got blood out of stone here with this, all or most of that money ended up on screen with it's impressive period design production values. The one aspect that I personally have never liked about Hammer horror films is the loud orchestral booming music often provided by James Bernard, I just don't like them & would prefer something a bit quieter & more subtle. In fact I have been know to deliberately turn the volume down when a long piece of music starts & turn it back up again when it finishes. The acting is very good from most of the cast, Peter Cushing is excellent as usual while Christopher Lee is unrecognisable under the make-up & doesn't get to say a single word, he would have his time & find fame though as Dracula.The Curse of Frankenstein is a classic & if you like horror films then the chances are you going to like this, if not then your not. Hammer Studios made six more Frankenstein films starting with The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958) & finishing with my personal favourite Hammer Frankenstein film Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell (1974) with The Horror of Frankenstein (1970) being a comedy remake of this.

All Curse really had going for it was a ferocious lurid energy, a smattering of blood, and a monomaniacal desire to shock at any cost (not to mention an amazing ability to take itself seriously). But that was enough to exalt it above all its competition and launch the careers of two of the three horror stalwarts of the next 20 years. This despite the fact the characters are flimsy pasteboard constructs and the damned thing makes no sense ay-tall. Victor Frankenstein is a one (shrill) note samba whose character arc and emotional range are both flat lines. Only Peter Cushing's intensity and absolute conviction allows us to follow him through the movie with nary a giggle. He is the compleat rotter, not only cheating on Hazel Court with the maid (which in and of itself is evidence of madness) but killing the poor girl when she complains. The luscious Court herself is awesomely decorative but that's about it--her Elizabeth is good-hearted but impossibly trusting and dim. Never once does she more than wonder vaguely what in the world Victor could be doing up in that lab of his. And Paul Krempe is a self-righteous hypocrite--he hates Victor's work and murders but aids and abets all the way through, sharing Victor's crimes but escaping punishment. As for the Creature--it's astonishing that Christopher Lee's career sprang from this wooden zombie of a non-performance. Makes Glenn Strange's Frankenstein Monster look like Laurence Olivier. Someone at Hammer must've known Lee could really act given the chance because there's nothing to hint at what he could do with a cape and fangs and a little blood smeared around his mouth. The real villain here is Jimmy Sangster, the screenwriter. The frame story is ludicrous--Victor can't get anyone to believe all these murders he's about to be executed for were actually done by a creature he built and animated. Why he would WANT to convince anyone is unclear, since he did a murder or two himself while building the thing. And what makes him think the authorities would pat him on the back and let him go with a wristy-slap if they knew the true story? At least poor Vic has a clear, consistent and believable motivation, he's the only character in the movie so blessed. Paul, the putative Good Guy and Moral Compass, whines and blusters but does nothing to stop him till the Creature has already killed. Victor, for his part, knows exactly how Paul feels about his work (having killed it once already) yet can't resist showing it to him again and again--then is astonished when Paul all but hurls chunks and heads for the authorities at the run. Elizabeth of course, being alone in the house, chooses this exact moment to FINALLY get curious about what goes on up there. And Victor, who throughout the movie has sweated and connived and murdered for his creature--and shown precious little regard for Elizabeth, even threatening her life--then turns around and SHOOTS his valued creation to save her! Bad as the movie was, worse was yet to come every sequel. At least its success brought about Horror of Dracula and inspired AIP, who'd single-handedly put the horror genre into the toilet with its I Was a Teenage (fill in the blank) series, to revive quality horror on these shores with the help of Vinnie Price, Roger Corman and the protean Dick Matheson.

That's not to say that it sticks to it entirely, not by a long shot; as Terence Fisher has still found than enough room for changes to the classic tale, thus making this film a fresh take on the classic tale. Peter Cushing stars as Baron Frankenstein; a role which may well be his finest of all time. Cushing's Frankenstein is more malevolent than the character usually is, giving this film a different twist on the tale from the start. In the Universal classic, Frankenstein was a mad scientist that realised his mistake, and thus the audience was able to forgive him after he repented his sins. Here, we have no such luck; the Frankenstein in this film is a completely morally bankrupt character that seeks no redemption for his sins.We follow Frankenstein from being a boy and taking control of the Frankenstein estate. It is then that he meets his tutor and later collaborator on his experiments, Paul Krempe. We then follow the two as they conduct experiments in an attempt to bring the living back to life, a la the classic story. This film, like most Hammer offerings, benefits from a lovely camp style. It's also a bonus to see Frankenstein in colour as most, if not all, of the Frankenstein films before this one were in black and white. Naturally, the inclusion of Peter Cushing in the lead role does this film no end of favours and despite his character being so awful, we are still able like him just because it's Peter Cushing. Cushing's co-star is Robert Urquhart, who plays his tutor. Urquhart does well with the role and it's a shame that the actor hasn't made more notable films because he's not bad at all. The cast is topped off by Cushing's long time collaborator and a man that would go on to become one of Hammer's biggest stars - the excellent Christopher Lee, who does a grand job in a campy turn as the monster itself.The Curse of Frankenstein isn't Hammer's best production, and to be honest I preferred the excellent Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed, but this stands tall as a solid entry in their oeuvre and is recommended to horror fans.

A shame considering the talents involved in this particular production Peter Cushing as a non-sympathetic Baron (Dr.) Frankenstein as opposed to Colin Clive's and Christopher Lee as the creature as he's billed in this version as opposed to Karloff's billing as The Monster - ? in the 1931 version. The English version of the 50's, 60's and 70's depends more on gruesome visuals of dissections and a certain amount of sexual implications than on creepy castle towers, fog enshrouded graveyards and just that bit of black comedy so often found in the Universal versions, especially in The Bride... of 1935. This is not to say that this is not a worthwhile effort but do not expect too much. By comparison it fails against the much more recognizable Karloff-Chaney-Lugosi-Strange monster characterizations. A good time waster but I wish that Hammer Studios had not been in such a hurry to capitalize on the Frankenstein name and spent a little more time/money on a better screenplay. It's a coin toss as to whether or not to see this one.

It's so bad that begun to be funny to watch. The mask that Lee use is so bad, that appear Lee's neck. Come on!!! Hammer Films, motion pictures is bad.Only some movies that not, like The Phantom of the Opera (The 1962 version) is good. There is one part on the movie, that is old man blind, and then the Creature attack him. And the effects is so bad, that you can see that in the turf the old man is not blind.Please, this is really bad!!! Peter Cushing, is acting is not good at all. But some times, he has a good acting. I do not like this movie, and the new Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is so better that this one that, transform this movie in the most trash Frankenstein ever!!! BELIEVE!

The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankenstein's family has been completely excised and replaced with... nothing. The heart and moral centre of the story is gone. It doesn't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving, devious murderer; he deserves everything he gets. The plot is a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clich√©s. Even taken on its own terms, this is rubbish a bland, rambling film featuring a shite-looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut. As it's the first of Hammer's horror films, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, its place in horror history is secure. But it's an awful film. "}]
