This is the second most underrated & unappreciated movie of 2000, following Book of Shadows The Blair Witch 2. There is nothing to not like about this movie, it is virtually non-stop laughs from beginning to end.Reading some other user's reviews I'm stunned at their disdain and hatred for this great film. People always say that this is no Citizen Kane...well duh...to quote Highlander There can be only one!. Now I'm not saying that this movie is in the same league as Citizen Kane, but that doesn't mean it's bad. This is an epic Sandler piece, and his funniest to date, and is quite possibly the definitive Sandler film.Unlike most people, I loathed Big Daddy, writing it off as cheesy and overly sentimental; a one-joke gag stretched beyond its limits. Luckily that does not apply to this film, every aspect of this film is great, from the surprise cameo by CHUBS (Carl Weathers) to Harvey Keitel's hilarious turn as Papa Satan. You've gotta love a movie that lets Quentin Tarantino use his unique acting ability to his advantage in a brilliant performance as the religious zealot. My favorite cameo belongs to B-Movie God Clint Howard...after this movie, I don't think I'll ever look at him the same way again! The Cameos are worth the ticket price alone!The story was top-notch and was brilliantly executed. This film definitely shows maturity in Adam Sandler and Tim Herlihy's writing abilities, as they created a complex and involving storyline, and great and hilarious characters.I recommend this film to any film fans. Give this one a shot, regardless of your personal view of Sandler and his talent. Sandler is one of the most underrated and ridiculed acts out there today, which is sad considering his remarkable talent.

In response to the negativity toward short cameos and ac-TEURS that should've been used more...*PLEASE!* Since when were Adam Sandler films about boring the audience to death with actors that deserve this and that.....You say they're thrown in there just because?

It also came to my attention that the people who think that Sandler is stupid, think the same of Jim Carrey and almost any other pure comedian, which narrows down their comedy taste to 'Scary Movie'.Little Nicky is a film that every Adam Sandler fan has to see. This picture is about the son of Satan, who comes to earth in order to save his father from extinction. Everything (yes, everything) that takes place place in this movie, from the cast to the script, to the cameo appearances of celebrities, pays homage to earlier Sandler works. Those little or sometimes bigger references are not only links to Sandler's previous movies but also to his recordings and SNL shows. It's a real treat for every true Adam Sandler fan!Also a great production along with a great Heavy Metal soundtrack make this film one of the best movies Adam's ever done.I have to warn you that you have to have at least some experience with Adam's previous efforts in order to appreciate 'Little Nicky'.

And it was one of those incidents in which I was in a crowded theater where I was pretty much the ONLY one laughing at most of the gags!  It wasn't exactly embarrassing, but kind of weird.  Then again, most of the people that came to see it were mothers and fathers with little children.  Please ignore the PG-13 rating--this is NOT a movie for the young ones!  I think anyone who has seen Sandler's previous films should know that by now.  His sense of humor may be immature, but that doesn't mean it's appropriate for little eyes to see. I watched this movie again, after I bought the DVD.  First of all, I was impressed to discover the cool Easter eggs!  It's actually the first DVD to be presented in InfiniFilm.  But since it was used as an Easter egg, it wasn't credited as the first InfiniFilm feature.  Well, as I learned a lot more about the behind-the-scenes work on this movie; mostly involving special effects, makeup, costume and set design; I gained a better respect for those who were responsible for making Little Nicky.  I thought of it as more than a shallow comedy.  It's obvious that the producers of Sandler's previous films didn't have to bend over backwards to produce any flashy effects--in fact, most of them were made on a modest budget. However, the laughs faded away a little.  Since this is a silly, superficial comedy, don't expect to pick up on any subtle humor that you might've missed the first time around.  I always found Sandler's schtick very silly and meaningless.  But he's one of those guys who can make me laugh at things for no apparent reason.  Almost as if I'm laughing AT him.  I've seen Billy Madison countless times and I still roll with laughter every time.  But with Little Nicky most of the jokes that I found silly-funny on my initial viewing were just silly on my second.One thing to anticipate is a stellar cast.  You'll be surprised at the kind of celebrities that pop up in the cameos.  Some of the big-name stars include Harvey Keitel, Patricia Arquette, Quentin Tarantino, Reese Witherspoon and (my personal hero) Rodney Dangerfield!  And that's just to name a few.  It would also help if you've seen Sandler's past films, especially in one particular scene with one of our mystery cameos.  You'll be treated to a great inside joke.  And of course, expect to see many of Sandler's regulars including Allen Covert, Clint Howard, Peter Dante, Blake Clark and Jon Lovitz.    Little Nicky is not a thoughtful piece and will probably do nothing to contribute to mankind.  But it's a very funny comedy that I simply advise you don't watch over and over again.  You'll enjoy it a lot the first time!  Of course, the DVD has some really cool features, so if anything pick that up.

Little Nicky is one of those films. Roasted upon its release as one of the worst films of all time Little Nicky turns out to be an okay comedy. Actually this is the kind of movie that has all of the ingredients to be a screamingly funny comedy, but somehow things don't work. Nicky, the son of the devil and an angel is sent to make his way in the world while one of his many brothers tries to take throne of Hell from their father. Casting everyone from Harvey Keitel to Rodney Dangerfield this is a film that fits into the Adam Sandler universe since several characters from some of his other films appear. Its a film that on star power alone should work, but it never catches fire. Sure there are laughs but on the whole nothing ever hangs together to form a full movie. I've seen the film several times and can't figure out what went wrong. Even Adam Sandler as Nicky, in one of the worst portrayals in screen history, isn't the reason this doesn't work. There is something else, some other reason.Still its worth seeing if you like okay comedies. It never scales the heights its ideas and bits say it should be reaching. If its on try it and see if its for you, you certainly could do worse.

Within the first 3 minutes you already know what your in for, a peeping tom dies and goes to hell to get humped by a actor dressed like a big bird, meanwhile 'I'm your boogie man' is playing in the background. We're introduced to Nicky who 'jams' with some large random weapon, his dad's assistant is basically used as the introduction to the plot, his dad (the devil), played by Harvey Keitel for some odd reason, is making the decision on who should be his successor for then next 10,000 years. It never explains why someones 'in office' for 10,000 years but there's not much need to care anyways. He also remarks on how Nicky was pretty until his brother hit him in the face with a shovel, foreshadowing his brothers as the antagonists. Basically, his dad declares himself ruler for another 10,000 years and Nicky's 2 brothers go to earth freezing the gate to hell, thus causing the devil to die for some reason(?), Keitel's finger falls off and Nicky starts his journey to return his brothers to hell.Probably about 10 minutes in now, the first thing that sticks out, is Sander. Sandler, while acceptable in just about all his other movies to this date (excluding that one where he's on a boat.), he's f*cking terrible in this. No words can explain how bad his performance is, its shallow, its half-a*sed, its not funny, its just ridiculously awful. To quote another disappointing movie, the ringer, 'I've seen better acting in porno'. As a whole, the supporting cast is also terrible. Nicky's sidekick i guess you'd say is a talking pit-bull glances at a doorstep that says 'i love acting' on it, he pis*es on it and says 'you love acting, well i love pis*ing', and to make matters even more mind numbingly awful the pis* is cgi'd obviously. Oh thats the next thing, the effects and production. This paragraphs dedicated to acting so let me get back on track. Usual members from the happy Madison gang are here, i've spotted like 4 people that are also in grandmas boy, and other crap flicks like the animal and Mr deeds and crap. Performances are half a*sed too, at most times secondary actor just read a line or two devoid of emotion or any form of acting. One standout role though is Quinton Tarantinos cameo as a blind preacher who appears about 3 times, other then that, nothing.The production is awful. Hell looks, for lack of a better and less offensive term, retarded. There is around 3 sets I've noticed. Nickys room, the entrance to hell, and the (INSANELY BOTCHED) throne. Nicky's room is literally covered in stickers of heavy metal bands, problem is, i counted like over 9000 Ozzy stickers and one big metallica one, obviously the set designers know nothing about metal, nor the crew/cast. The throne is just like a mass hall, except the size of a small house basement, there's nothing that resembles artistic detail at all, it'd pass for a normal room to me. the gates also stupid, there's some rock like walls and a cheap frozen fire effect for the gate it self, no effort seemed to be used. the sad thing is, the gate is easily the most used. The rest of the sets on earth are one apartment room, a basketball stadium thing(I'm not a sports fan.), a park shoot, and the rest is all sidewalks. Oh yeah hell breaks loose by the end, and the sets turn into cgi awfulness, its so awful that by that point i went on my laptop and started chatting. The CGI is as awful as you'd expect from 1999/2000, but...its used throughout the whole movie. in fact all the special effects in the movie were cgi i noticed, of abysmal quality.Last thing i'm going to rant about is the script, 'What we're they thinking!?' - avgn. Its a comedy, to be a 'good' comedy, it has to be funny. Unfortantly it isn't, its like a stream of half baked jokes like Nicky spinning his head around to entertain his friends (Oh he's doing the exorcist thing, thats pure comedy.), and Satan sticking a pineapple up Hitler's a*s. At a glance, you'r still likely to ask to your self, 'whats the point.'. The plot it self is rubbish. If two brothers out of hell for some reason make the devil have 'a week' to live, wouldn't another one shorten his life span even more thus making his coming to earth a bad idea. The brothers deceiving the humans is also like 'wut?'. They possess a minister and tell everyone 'let the Sin, be-Gin', to which a completely packed church gets out of their seat and everyone starts cheering. Yeah, thats very likely to happen. These parts are somewhat spaced out, because until like the last 20 minutes, Nicky does nothing but walk around, and do nothing. None of the jokes are funny, the plot is literally insane, its lost in its own continuity also.i'm not going to spell check this review cause i feel that the movie sucked so bad that it's not worth the time of what i've already written. It sucks, it sucks even on a Adam Sander level. Its not funny, its not entertaining, its just downright lame. Bad script, bad acting, bad story, bad production, bad just about everything. To the mind of a child, its acceptable, but for a audience over 12 (The movies rated pg13 by the way.), its damn near worth destroying.

For some reason, most of the music in the film seemed to fit. When Nicky is in Heaven and they start playing Filter's Take My Picture, something in my mind clicked that this was right. The song fit in with the atmosphere created for Heaven. The funniest part in the movie which gets a 10 out of 10 is the beginning of the film starring the highly underrated Jon Lovitz.

With no choice but to send his third, weaker son, Satan sends Nicky to Earth to capture his brothers and bring them back to Hell and restore the norm. However the simple and naïve Nicky struggles to cut it in the real world.I will always give Adam Sadler films a go because I often find just about enough moments of inspired lunacy among the puerile and pretty unfunny material. Sadly, this outing sees such a terrible plot combined with awful acting, unfunny writing, tired special effects and crude joking and almost no moments that took me by surprise and made me laugh. Instead the film is just plain stupid with very few laughs in it at all. Of course it may well appeal to some with its silly humour and its silly crude joking but personally it was pretty laugh free and the whole idea of the film was too dumb and silly to really work. The actual plot is never a really strong aspect of any Sadler film but here it is just all over the place. It is not that it makes no sense, it is more that it lacks any sense of fun at all and the dark tone is totally misjudged and the usual moments of inspired craziness is really limited to one or two moments (the best being the Fonz covered in bees!).The cr*p script is not helped at all by a cast that is either rubbish or wasted. Sadler himself falls into the 'rubbish' camp with a performance that is like his usual mugging but even more unbearable. With his twisted expression and nasty voice, he was actually painful to watch &#150; and this is not based on a hatred of Sadler (I loved him in Punchdrunk a few days ago) it is based on the fact that this is a terrible performance with nothing but a terrible idea and a terrible character to work with. The support cast is made up of plenty of well-known faces but few are used well at all and too many of them are embarrassing. Keitel falls into the latter category and he has a thankless role that is not worthy of his talent. Ifans and Lister are given hard work by mostly doing voice work with poor dialogue (in their heads) and they were not funny at all. Arquette is given nothing to do at all but still manages to be lame and annoying. The various cameos are mixed &#150; Taratino is just dumb; Dangerfield is OK but not given enough time; Weathers, Witherspoon, Witherspoon and others are all given nothing to do other than show their faces but Lovitz and Schneider at least provide some unexpected weirdness in very minor roles.Overall, Sadler films are normally average at best but I must say that I found this to be devoid of all but the slightest hint of the inspired humour that he can often create. The story is stupid and silly, the acting both bad and embarrassing, the script filled with misfiring jokes that are mostly in bad taste as well as being unfunny (a bad combination). A real waste of time that will only appeal to the most die-hard fans of Sadler and those that only like their comedy to be very basic indeed.  "},{"Title":"Little Nicky?

For a moment it looks like Nicky has finally accomplishes his mission of dragging his brother back to hell. However, his success is foiled because instead of going to hell, he is taken up to heaven (where he meets his mother).

Since warming up to him, I have developed the theory that critics are too hard on him just because for some reason he seems to enjoy playing mentally challenged people. In all fairness, he seems like an OK guy, and he even cowrote this enjoyable special effects ladden fantasy/horror/comedy to broaden his horizons. The movie deals with the Devil (a surprisingly believable Harvey Keitel)'s warm-hearted son Nicky (Sandler) who has to travel to Earth for the first time and adapt to his surroundings in an attempt to find his evil half-brothers, brilliant and sinister Adrian (a wonderfully wicked performance by Rhys Ifans, who looks a lot like Billy Idol) and big and dumb Cassius (Tom Tiny Lister, Jr., a.k.a. Zeus in the WWF) who are out to destroy dear old Dad because he wouldn't step down from the throne when he was supposed to by making life Hell on Earth and closing the gates to the old Hell so no new souls can get in.Needless to say, with the exception of Nicky's unnecessary speech impediment, this movie is unlike anything Adam Sandler has done before. He's not used to doing big special effects movies with fantasy, horror, adventure elements, but that's not to say he's not good at it. And even though I liked Big Daddy, I'd have to say that Little Nicky is his best film. And the cameos from stars aren't bad either. Two particular cameos that stick out in my mind are Rodney Dangerfield (one of Sandler's comic heroes) as Grandpa Lucifer, Even in hell I get no respect! and Reese Witherspoon as Holly, Nicky's Heavenly mother, I just called him SON! This is so WILD!The best scenes are the Harlem Globetrotters game and when Nicky turns himself into a bunch of little spiders to get into his apartment without being noticed by the police.

Falling from the tree in shock, he is killed, and we get out first glimpse of Hell through the eyes of Adam Sandler.I would have loved to see some concept art from the film.  The artful sets present a goofy, non-threatening hell, reminiscent of `Far Side' comics- rock, fire, brimstone, servants, etc.  Director Steven Brill then introduces us to the family.  Harvey Keitel, stars as the Prince of Darkness himself, though in Sandler's world, we see a cartoonish devil and family man, hoping to soon pass on the kingdom to one of his three sons, Cassius (`Tiny' Lister, Jr.), Adrian (Rhys Ifans), and Nicky (Sandler).Nicky is the youngest son of Satan, a nice boy who's basically afraid of evil and likes making heavy-metal mix tapes.  He's got a goofy hair, a constant grimace and a speech impediment due to an head-on encounter with a shovel.The Devil calls his sons for a family meeting- it is his 10,000th year as ruler of Hell, and under normal circumstances, this would mean he is to pass the kingdom on to one of his sons.  In this case, however, Beelzebub feels that his sons aren't ready for the responsibility and decides to keep the throne for himself. Nicky seems to be fine with the decision, but Adrian and Cassius are so angry that they leave Hell and commence wreaking havoc in New York, instead.  For lack of a better explanation, this causes a disturbance in the force, making it impossible for new souls to enter Hell, and also causing the Devil to slowly decay into nothingness.  To restore balance to the universe, Nicky must travel to earth to bring his brothers back.  Makes sense to me.Along the way, we become acquainted with a great ensemble cast.  Patricia Arquette plays a cute but geeky art student who becomes the object of Nicky's affection.  Reese Witherspoon is perfectly cast in a bit part as Nicky's mother, and we see Quentin Tarantino as a frenzied streed preacher. Other cameos include Dana Carvey, Kevin Nealon, Popeye's chicken, Henry Winkler, Rodney Dangerfield (as Satan's father), and Ozzy Osbourne. Most Sandler movies keep you chuckling comfortably throughout.  In contrast, Little Nicky is a series of belly laughs.  Sandler fans may be disappointed by the lack of memorable quotes, but some of the sight gags are priceless.`Little Nicky' is a lot of fun, but certainly not Sandler's best.  This became obvious when I realized that some of the film's best gags came from references to his past movies; we get to see the Rob Schneider's cajun hermit (You can do it!!!), and a two-handed Chubbs Peterson (It's all in the hips!).  The film's biggest fault was, oddly enough, the character of Nicky. I love goofy Sandler characters, but the speech impediment and facial expressions on this got old after the first five minutes. I won't give a lot of credit to the director, good or bad; it's obvious that Sandler was pulling all the strings in this one.  Not his best, but definitely not his worst- I give `Little Nicky' a `C+.'

I personally find the whole concept of eternal damnation repellent (and am staggered that, even in the scientifically-advanced age in which we live, so many people still believe that hell not only exists, but is also this big fiery pit under the ground), and was therefore less than amused by the way that this movie begins with a guy being condemned to eternal torment in Satan's barbecue (and for nothing more than a bit of voyeurism at that).  The gag involving Adolf Hitler and a pineapple was also pretty tired, I thought.However!  As this movie progressed, I found myself (literally against my will) finding it very, very funny.  How can you hate a movie, after all, that features such on-screen gems as the world's ugliest transvestite (more horrible than even the ghastliest tortures that a son of Satan can think up); not one but two scenes in which Henry Winkler gets attacked by swarms of bees; and a scene which has Ozzy Osbourne playing a pivotal role in saving the world from the forces of darkness?  And as for that scene right at the end where those two metalheads find everlasting happiness in hell that moved me so much I almost cried.In addition to containing some fine comic moments, this film features some pretty cool characters.  The aforementioned metalheads were among my favourites, as was Satan's son Adrian.  Played by Rhys Ifans (who seems to have been cast as a complete prick in everything in which I have seen him of late), this character has a certain pleasing androgyny (sort of reminds me of all those '70s glam rock stars) and an English accent that proves devilishly charming.

So many guest stars were thrown in just for cheap laughs that I almost became ill (I still feel that Henry Winckler deserved MUCH MORE than this cameo), although a ray of light was the appearance of Chubs Peterson of Happy Gilmore fame.But what annoyed me the most was how this dim-minded movie seemed to cater to tit jokes (just listen to Rodney Dangerfield) and other pre-adolescent humor.  For everyone who has seen such Sandler gems as Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer, this movie just shows that he needs to take a short vacation to come up with new ideas.He has a new film coming out in December, called Eight Crazy Nights (billed as a Hannukah musical).

I waited for the video because people said if you want a good time see Charlie's Angels (which was AWFUL) so I did. I am sorry. Little Nicky has everything from action to comedy, to just a hint of drama. The plot wasn't much, but the jokes were crazy and worth it. From the humping bird to the beginning, to the demon at the end (popeye's chicken is the shiz-nit!) the jokes were always fast and coming at you. A few times there'd be a painful one, but that was few and far between. I especially love the basketball scene. It has the perfect mix of everything. One other major good point is the MUSIC. Awesome, what can I say! I'm not a real fan of rock/rap, but POD's songs were fitting, as well as the badass acoustic version of Everlong. Plus the greatest band ever Incubus was in it too. As well as Linkin Park. Anywho, I didn't go a single scene without laughing. If there was a particular dry spell, there'd be a big joke at the end to revive itself. The Chris Farley and Chubb's bits were hilarious too, and I strongly disagress with whoever said the ending was boring. The best joke is given here (when the demon says, Popeyes chicken is the shiz-nit! the way it was delivered, and the fact that the fact is true, it had me crying. I went back and forth, rewinding to hear it over again) And the pillow fight ruled as well. The whole montage thing at the end was hilarious too. Little Nicky is the prime example of a comedy. All good comedies are underrated, while crap comedies are overpraised. So it's fitting this did bad, because AS's two most successful films (Big Daddy and Wedding Singer) were his worst.

One or two things made me laugh, but not as much as I expect from a Sandler movie. The various other comedians featured in the film, to me, were pretty boring, too. I didn't even realize that Dana Carvey was the referee until I saw him in the cast on this page; Rodney Dangerfield did his usual comedic shtick even though I thought it wasn't as good as some of his jokes I've heard in guest appearances on Leno; Kevin Nealon's character is just plain not funny (I thought he was hilarious in Happy Gilmore). Jon Lovitz, on the other hand, was pretty funny though with the help of an oversized bird. The one thing I really did enjoy was the reference to a previous Sandler movie using one of its characters (for you Adam Sandler fanatics You will enjoy that part).The plot itself, I felt, was pretty stupid in my opinion. OK, so maybe Sandler's films--with the exception of Big Daddy and The Wedding Singer--aren't made to be for critical acclaim, I felt that for once the critics had every right to say what they did about this flick. It may be that I'm not into those fantasy-type movies, but the story was just so lame that it I wouldn't wish for Satan himself to see this God-forsaken movie.I haven't seen it since the second day it was in theatres, and I do plan on buying it eventually to complete my Adam Sandler collection, but for those that haven't seen it I advise you NOT to waste $20 on the DVD, 15 bucks buying it on VHS, or even $5 at your local Blockbuster. If you really do want to see this movie for yourself, try to do so while at someone else's house who owns the movie or already rented it.

It is as though the Devil himself came to earth to torture some of our most revered talents (Sandler among them) by forcing them to make a movie that would endlessly shame and haunt their lifework's canon. I had an excuse for seeing it; much of it was filmed in my neighborhood. Vanity made me want to see my favorite haunts on film.

He prefers to entertain his audience of college students and teenagers with a cornucopia of absurdities and toilet jokes.  Little Nicky is much the same, but with two major differences.There is a heavy dependance on special effects in this film.  Nicky, as the Devil's son, obviously resides in Hell and Sandler's version of Hell is pretty impressive looking, at least in wide, panoramic shots of the geography.  The special effects are put to good use here, but it isn't very scary.  Hell looks like a fine place to live, and as the Devil,   Harvey Keitel seriously downplays both the Devil's evil side and his funny side, doing little to add to the film.  There is little to be scared of in this Hell. Except for the occassional gross-out gag.Nicky goes to Earth to prevent his brothers, the two most evil characters, from corrupting the souls on earth and thereby, in a convuluted and pointless plot, killing Nicky's beloved father.  While on earth, Nicky is aided by a talking bulldog, a couple of metalheads looking for some cred, and a shy but sweet girl played by Patricia Arquette.Sandler always has a love story in his films, but never has one been so juvenile.  Nicky is little more than a shy teenager, new to earth and awkward in expressing himself, and the scenes where he falls for Arquette are ineffective and cloyingly sensitive.  Hearing the Devil's son talking about butterflies in his stomach, in a film that features a character sprouting breasts on his head, struck me as an odd juxtaposition.  10 year olds will love some of the jokes and they might even enjoy the cheesy romance, G-rated as it is, but would you want your 10 year-old going to a movie that features an enormous bird attempting to copulate with Jon Lovitz?Sandler needs to choose an audience, this movie is splintered down the middle as he attempts to appeal to 5th graders with his goofiness and to college kids with his scatalogical side.  It never reaches any level of cohesiveness, though it remains entertaining in fits and starts.  Between the special effects, the sap and the raunch, the movie gets lost in the mix. Next time, Sandler should choose one audience and ride it all the way through.

Various characters from his previous films pop up in the appropriate and inappropriate places.  His usual mix of gross out humor and sweet natured humor is slightly askew, in favor of the gross out humor.  And having two other screenwriters helping him on the script didn't really go over as well as his usual tandem of writers.  Still, the film does make you laugh when you shouldn't and the depiction of hell is a lot more amusing than in South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut.Maybe Sandler wants to grow up.  Maybe he wants to do something different. Either way, don't expect him to do Shakespeare for a while.Adam Sandler's Nicky was a promising character.  He's the son of the devil who just isn't evil enough.  When Dad decides to extend his reign over the underworld for another 10,000 years, Nicky's two older brothers don't like the idea.  So they close the gates of hell and make Manhattan the new Hades. Nicky, of course, has to bring them back to save dear old dad.  Hilarity ensues.The rest of the cast, Patricia Arquette as the love interest, Rodney Dangerfield as Lucifer, Clint Howard as the gatekeeper, add some amusing bits to the scenery.  Arquette is probably the only actress around that can look pretty in the grotesque sense.  And the various cameos from SNL regulars (not to mention a few surprises) can either be amusing or stupid. Still, Adam's fans will eat this one up.  The curious should spend no more than matinee prices.  But those who know that they want to see it will.

However, as much as I hate to, I have to give an A for effort. This movie has some interesting special effects and an interesting commentary on the punk rock/metal culture. End. Sandler, as the son of Satan, plays the part to perfection. As the third son of Satan, oddly reminiscent of Sandler's Waterboy (an outcast with a speech impediment), he has to save all of hell and of earth from the wrath of his two far superior brothers, one played by Rhys Ifans who I believe gives one of the only decent performances in this movie. Sandler is everything that a movie critic despises. He's irritating, and acts terribly. The rest of the acting is sub-par as well, even from the great Harvey Keitel, but I guess it's hard to give anything as the part of Satan in a comedy such as this one.Bad acting + cheap laughs + box office flop= Comedy Central gold!

On the other hand, some of the humor went way over my head because it was either too idiotic or too immature.So I guess Little Nicky is a mixture of three kinds of humor extremely funny, not quite so funny and most definitely not funny.

It was far more crude than Adam Sandler's other movies put together, and this one provided little thematic material. But it is still good for a laugh. Adam Sandler plays Nicky, one of the three sons of the Devil (Harvey Keitel). When the Devil starts dying off after his other two sons Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and Cassius (Tommy Tiny Lister, Jr.) leave the gates of Hell, Nicky must go to Earth to stop them. This movie provides humor on almost every level. While some jokes are lamer than others, most of them are good and original. Adam Sandler proves that he can still make people laugh. While LITTLE NICKY isn't quite what I expected it to be, it was still pretty good. I was hoping for something not quite so crude and dumb. Adam Sandler's earlier movie BILLY MADISON was one of the best of his films. It provided a lot of crude humor (which is good) and provided some natural and thematic moments among the characters. LITTLE NICKY is just crudeness all the way with some moments that try to be dramatic, but just end up being stupid and unbelievable. Rhys Ifans was hilarious as the arch enemy brother Adrian. He was probably my favorite character in the whole film because he was the one who knew what he was doing all along and still managed to be funny. And because he was the most sissified of the brothers. There are also many, many actors who play in this film. The supporting cast includes Patricia Arquette, Kevin Nealon, Jon Lovitz, Regis Philbin, Ozzy Osbourne, Allen Covert, Jonathan Loughran, Henry Winkler and many more!

Because Ozzy Osbourne made this film. I don't care who wrote it, I don't care who starred in it, and I don't care who directed it, if Ozzy hadn't been in Little Nicky, there would be absolutely no reason to watch it. Even the great Harvey Keitel, who obviously makes an excellent Satan, was ill-used if for no other reason than that idiotic deterioration that left him as nothing but a pair of arms and a mouth. Come on, people! Whose dumbass idea was that?! Anyway, Ozzy's was only one (by far the best one, mind you) of a whole series of cool cameos. We see a whole succession of great cameos in Little Nicky. Ozzy causes every rock and roll fan in the audience to jump up and cheer by biting the head off of the devil when he turns into a bat. Chubbs, Happy Gilmore's late, one-handed golf instructor shows up in a scene in heaven, along with Reese Witherspoon, who effectively plays the part of Little Nicky's angel mother who happens to also be an absolute bimbo. Rodney Dangerfield is his traditional self as the father of Satan (`Even in Hell I get no respect.'). John Lovitz has a scene early in the film where he sits in a tree spying on some woman while she changes, and he's listening to `Lady's Night,' the song that he performed in The Wedding Singer, which was obviously a much better film than this one. Even Dan Marino who, in my opinion, was made famous more by Ace Ventura than anything else, had a great part where he tries to sell his soul to the devil just to win a football game. And, of course, someone was amazingly able to get The Great Quentin Tarantino to play the part of a hideously creepy religious nut, in the second best cameo in the film (even Quentin can't compete with Ozzy). I could go on and on about the cool cameos in this movie.How about Little Nicky's room in Hell? What a great room for the son of the devil! Can I say something, by the way? The religious right attacks Marilyn Manson for every little thing he does, but I hereby officially bet any amount of money that no religious group on the planet will ever defend him by pointing out that there was not a single picture or poster of him in Nicky's room in Hell. You have to notice this when you see posters of Metallica, Ozzy (of course), Ministry, Motorhead, Korn, AC/DC, Slipknot, Black Sabbath, etc. No one ever accused Korn of driving kids to worship the devil, yet the devil's son seems to be one of their biggest fans.There was a little too much cheesy comedy in this movie. And yes, I realize that it is a `Happy Madison' picture, and that these movies are characterized by their cheesy comedy. But the gigantic pineapple up Hitler was a step in the wrong direction. And how about that damn dog? Remember the scene where he shoots an arrow at Adrian, Nicky's evil brother? Of my GOD, that was ridiculous. And then there were John and Pete, a couple of idiot rock and roll fanatics that appear throughout the film in a series of dumbass scenes that make all rock and roll fans look bad. Although it was cool when one of them asks Nicky what was recorded backwards on Ozzy's record, and Nicky says that `the Blizzard' always delivered his message straight. Too bad they didn't use a Marilyn Manson song to do that, but as much as I respect him and love his music, he doesn't even come close to Ozzy. Little Nicky has a lot of cool stuff in it, such as an excellent soundtrack (notice the surprisingly good re-mix of Stupefy, by Disturbed, during the end credits), but most everything else is just pretty bad. And besides that, the soundtrack during the film was used as little more than to pack songs into the movie so that they could sell the soundtrack later, although some of the songs worked really well where they were put into the movie (Particularly Powerman 5000's `When Worlds Collide'). Little Nicky is sent to earth to capture his rebelling older brothers, because they escaped from hell, freezing the entrance and causing their father's deterioration. And then the Son of Satan meets some girl and falls in love with her! Everything about that little subplot was just awful, except for the way that he barely rescued her from the subway train late in the film, but it was actually a good decision to cast Patricia Arquette in this role. Except, remember when Nicky was explaining possession to her? `What do you mean, &#145;possessed?' Come on, Patricia, POSSESSION. Didn't you learn anything from starring in Stigmata? The plot of Little Nicky is of no value or interest whatsoever, it's the cameos that make it worth watching. Clearly, there can be no satisfaction derived from watching Adam Sandler's breathy performance as the son of Satan as he `releases the evil' and then `releases the good.' The plot and story are inconsequential, but the movie is still pretty funny at some points, so it's not a complete waste of time. It pays great homage to rock and roll stars as well as previous successful comedies, but if you're not a rock and roll fan or if you haven't seen a lot of these goofy comedies, you are almost sure to be disappointed by Little Nicky.

Aided by Beefy, a vulgar talking bulldog, a gay actor, and two heavy metal, Satan worshipping deadheads, Nicky finds himself doing constant battle with them while being occasionally shuttled back to Hell each time he dies. If you hate Sandler movies, this won't make much of a difference but if you love Sandler movies, you're on a 50/50 basis. The ending is the worst of all time and it seems like Sandler said I don't care anymore and he gives it a tacked on ending that is devoid of any originality nor humor. There wasn't one smirk nor snicker when the ending was on. People were leaving the movie theater before the movie had even ended because of Little Nicky's inability to make you laugh.

It's the joy of belching loudly at the dinner table,hawking spit off a bridge and watching it plummet into the water, and making endless jokes about your own feces.That joy is best expressed by Adam Sandler's newest film Little Nicky. Its raunchy, goofy, and downright hilarious, but only if you have the stomach and the maturity level to handle it.While most Sandler films are presented in this adolescent ilk, this one is more so, relying on more gross-out jokes than his previous films. It's not that I'm knocking the approach (in fact, I was laughing louder than most people in the audience), it's just that once again, it takes a certain type of individual to enjoy this style of humour.This could be called Adam Sandler's first big budget film, as it relies on special effects and elaborate sets more than his previous ones. Sometimes this approach is effective, such as the superb sets of hell, which are really spooky. However, most of the time it is overdone, substituting style for substance. The great things about films like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, and The Waterboy was that the jokes were from the characters and situations, and not from the spectacle on screen. One joke I found particularly unfunny was the addition of breast to the Gatekeeper's (Kevin Nealon) head. Sure you can do it with special effects, but why?Fortunately, Sandler himself is in top-gear, giving a good performance and making up for all the other weak spots of the film. With his bad hair cut and odd speaking voice, Sandler still somehow creates a completely sympathetic and funny character. Personally, I think Adam Sandler's got some acting talent, but only when he's playing a comedic (please forgive his feigned attempt at seriousness in Big Daddy).Sandler has also surrounded himself with an endless list of Saturday Night Live alumni and other famous folks in cameo roles.

It's not his best movie, but then again, it isn't his worse (I leave that distinction to The Wedding Singer, which I found remarkably bland).

His past efforts like Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy were wonderful films that probably surprised everyone with their box office success.  But no matter who you are, no matter how successful, there always comes a time when you stall.  Current kings of the box office, Jim Carrey and Tom Cruise are perfect examples.  Their propensity for success hit a road block when they did Me Myself and Irene and Eyes Wide Shut, respectively.  Sandler is about to hit that same snag with this film.  It had a good but not outstanding 15 million dollar opening weekend.  His other films grossed 41 and 39 million on their opening weekends.  So Little Nicky is destined for mediocrity.  And part of the reason why this film is not going to dominate the box office is because it is not really that good.  The comedy in here feels a little stale.  I can remember laughing myself silly with some of his other films, in this one I just seemed to chuckle mildly.  Not that it's a bad thing because it is still quite entertaining but it is not gut splitting hilarity.  There are some great cameos in the film and my favourites were Carl Weathers and Reese Witherspoon as a not quite so pure valley girl angel.  But there were also some disappointments.  Harvey Keitel as Satan and Rodney Dangerfield as his grandpa could have been so much better.  Same with Quentin Tarantino's turn as a blind sidewalk preacher.  Tarantino has had some memorable cameos especially in Sleep With Me, but here he is lame and unneccessary.For a light comedic film, you can do worse than Little Nicky but there are also far better films out there.  This may be worth seeing once, on a Tuesday or a matinee, but if I had paid full price for this I would have left unsatisfied.  5 out of 10  Not Sandler's best.   "},{"Title":"Very Funny!

I was under the impression that this was some kind of comedy. Evidently not. Oh well, at least there are a raft of top class actors and comedians queuing up for cameos and supporting roles &#150; maybe they will be able to inject some class into proceedings. Nothing doing there either, I'm afraid. This is rubbish. Thoughtless, childish pap that adds considerable credence to the notion that Adam Sandler is as overrated as he is irritating. It is a sad state of affairs when filmmakers believe they can simply unleash this goofy, rubber-faced moron on a trusting and frankly deluded public and gleefully scoop up gazillions of dollars in takings. But why wouldn't they think that? Sandler is a veritable Box Office cash cow.This has been a mystery to me for years. Sandler is a comedian who (in his films at least) HAS NO GAGS! Not only does he not do jokes, but his physical comedy is pretty ordinary too. His success is based purely on the pathos generated by the losers he plays. The man is obviously no mug. He has worked out that producers are falling over themselves to offer him twenty million bucks a throw to fall over a couple of times and wear bad 1980s clothing. Nice work if you can get it.I will grudgingly give him The Wedding Singer where he fortuitously stumbled on some decent chemistry with Drew Barrymore, but aside from that his movies are generally overly sentimental and woefully short on substance.Little Nicky is another opportunity to build a weak, convoluted story around one of Sandler's lovable schmucks. Well they got it half right. His eponymous 'hero' (and I use the term in its loosest possible sense) is certainly a schmuck, but he is about as lovable as herpes.Nicky is the youngest son of the Devil (Harvey Keitel. Really.). When Dad reaches pensionable age (10,000 years in this case), he is supposed to retire and hand over the reins to an heir. Not believing any of his diabolical offspring suitable for the job, he decides to stay in charge himself. This incenses his other two sons (Rhys Ifans and Tom Lister Jr) and they decide to snub life in Hades in favour of running riot up on Earth. Their departure freezes over the gates of Hell and begins to physically debilitate old Satan. If parity cannot be restored and the naughty boys returned down below, Harvey is in serious danger of disappearing into thin air (which, it strikes me, would actually be a blessing).Anyway, sweet-natured, not-evil-enough-to-rule, Earth-virgin Nicky is dispatched up to retrieve his errant brothers. With hilarious consequences, obviously. Well, I guess that's the theory.But the expected barrage of fish-out-of-water stereotypes never materialises. Instead, there are a series of bizarre, contrived scenes many of which centre around the toilet habits of an annoying talking dog.The biggest problem (and there are many) is Sandler. His previous characters may have been absurdly insipid and one-dimensional, but at least he injected them with a modicum of warmth. A thirty-four year old man shuffling about in a duffel coat and trying to portray a blushing adolescent is more frightening than cute. He is severely hindered by an appalling nasal whine that may have sounded amusing on a thirty second Saturday Night Live skit, but begins to grate when affected for the entire duration of a ninety-minute feature. He sounds like a cross between a hood on the Sopranos and Muttley out of the Wacky Races. In short, the character is decidedly unlovely, borderline creepy and, most importantly, relentlessly unfunny.No supporting cast can sustain a lead like that. Keitel, Rodney Dangerfield, Quentin Tarantino, Patricia Arquette and Reese Witherspoon (as a Clueless-cliché angel) do not disgrace themselves but won't see this as their finest hour. Ifans at least looks like he's approached the project with his tongue firmly in his cheek. His perpetual look of amused bewilderment almost made me smile.

Little Nicky is the end of the line for Sandler's long string of great comedies. This is one of the most offensive comedies I have seen because of his inane body gestures, stupid jokes and miscast actors. I left the theater asking myself what could he be thinking by making this film.One of the most confusing aspects about Little Nicky was the consistency in jumping from one subject to the other without focusing  on any one particular subject. Instead, Sandler recruits Harvey Keitel, Rodney Dangerfield, Allen Covert, Reese Witherspoon, Patricia Arquette and Rhys Ifans to star in this painful excuse of a film. These fine actors made the biggest mistake of their careers as they signed on to participate in Little Nicky.Little Nicky is another reason why movie studios should pay closer and much more careful attention to the films they make. Also, they should re-examine the standards for films without a plot containing substance characters en developed to its fullest potential and screenplays that seem to be written without much effort.Little Nicky revolves around the life of Nicky, the son of the devil,who must travel above ground to capture his brothers as they create havoc. While above ground, Nicky meets a beautiful girl and makes new friends, which creates difficulties for him as he tries to accomplish his mission. Little Nicky made me feel so sleepy I almost fell into a coma.There is a difference between silly comedy and stupid comedy; unfortunately, Little Nicky fails to reach the level of great comedy because all of the comedy is offensive. From the body gestures to the jokes, I felt sick watching this film. I can almost guarantee that people would not have seen Little Nicky if they knew it was a senseless comedy. This is not a trait that people will find attractive. Little Nicky lost its credibility and right to be called a comedy because of its many problems, inconsistencies and stupid comedy. I lost respect for this film when it became clear the cast and crew were relying on stupid comedy for its success.The only tolerable aspect of Little Nicky was the appearances of Dangerfield and Keitel because they played the most interesting characters in the movie. I hope this film won't hurt their careers to much.I have always been a fan of Sandler's films, so it came as a shock when I saw this film because I thought he would produce much better than this. Sandler films such as The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy, Big Daddy and Bulletproof gave me reason to smile because I knew he didn't have to try hard to make me laugh; something Little Nicky did and failed. Sandler IS a great comedian; however, he has failed to make me laugh with Little Nicky. I hope he gets back on track soon because he may not have a long career making films like Little Nicky.Arquette is an actress who is wasted in her role because she has no supportaround her. I have had the pleasure to watch actress on screen who adds so much to each film she takes part in, so I had to ask myself why she decided to sign on for this role. From beauty and charm to screen presence, Arquette has created a repetoire that will make everyone smile with talents she uses in each film she stars in; however, she fails to convince me that her performance was great. I know she has the ability to come back from this mistake and rebound from this awful film; my only concern is if Little Nicky will be the first or last in this streak of bad career choices.I wish I had the option to watch Little Nicky for free because if I had known that it was this bad I would keep my wallet in my pocket and urge everyone to stay away from this film.  My advice to every movie fan is to stay away from this movie and keep your money or spend it on a film worthwhile.

With the success of The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy and Big Daddy, he's been shying away from the normal Adam Sandler stick that everyone who loves him enjoys to see. Well Adam Sandler fans rejoice because he is back with a vengeance. Little Nicky is the wild and craziest Sandler film I have ever seen. It may not be the best (I think all will agree with me that that title goes to Billy Madison) but it is the edgiest. The plot revolves around the Satan (Harvey Keitel) after a certain amount of years has to pick a new ruler of Hell. He has to choose from his three sons Adrian (Rhys Ifans), Cassius (Tom Tiny Lister Jr.) and Nicky (Sandler). When he decides to choose himself as the new ruler Adrian and Caussius are livid. They decided to go through the fire of hell backwards and conquer Earth, making it the new Hell. In doing this they are slowly killing Satan, he loses body parts and his power the longer they're on Earth. The only one that can save Earth and Satan is the incompetent and very stupid Nicky. So he goes to Earth to learn how to use his powers and stop his brothers from making Earth the new hell. On the way he meets a cast a characters that is about a mile long. There are so many cameos in this film I lost count. There are many SNL former members (none from the likes of Rock, Spade, or Myers) but there are a very few noticeable one. The comedy is border line on rated R material as there are many gross jokes related on sexual humor, some drug related gags and just some disturbingly funny images. All a person would expect in an Adam Sandler film and more. Sandler pulls off the weird voiced Nicky just like he did Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy. He's always the stand out in his film but everyone else pulled off their characters as best as they could. They were all believable. For those Sandler fans who have seen any of his films, that including Happy Gilmore, will get a very funny and enjoy surprise with one of the cameos. Along with the normal Sandler antics the soundtrack is right on the money. Each song goes along with the action on the screen.

And Sandler doesn't stop at being childish and crass, he has to be naff as well (probably to appeal to the date-movie market) and throw in a good measure of sickly romance.The long list of cameos (from Dangerfield to Witherspoon) only demonstrates how much weight this type of junk pulls in Hollywood -- a deeply depressing thought.

If you want cheap laughs that everyone gets, and silly things that'll make you giggle, rent movies by Sandler like Billy Madison (his TRUE best), Happy Gilmoure (a close second), and perhaps even The Wedding Singer (good, but not the same type of comedy as found in Happy and Billy).

This movie has great (or at least good) potential as a comedy &#150; but is ruined by a grating lead performance, poor scriptwriting, and increasingly lame jokes. Worst of all, however, is the totally inept direction &#150; had the film been delivered to better talent, it could have easily been Adam Sandler's best comedy. It's one of his worst, simply because the amateur handling is similar to that of worse duds like Battlefield Earth. Sandler's Billy Madison wasn't anything special but at least it was adequately made.No faults in the cast. With performances and cameos including Patricia Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Rodney Dangerfield, Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Reese Witherspoon, Henry Winkler, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Schneider, Michael McKean, Robert Smigel, Regis Philbin and Carl Weathers, the film's flaw is its script &#150; the talented actors are required to mutter extremely contrived dialogue, and most of the time they do so quite embarrassingly. Watching Keitel is painful &#150; he's not even trying. You know you're in trouble when a film's best performance is by Quentin Tarantino &#150; in this case, as a blind preacher who has a habit of injuring himself (every time we see him it's a new brace, bandage, etc.).The plot is basically this titular character 'Little' Nicky (Sandler) is the son of Lucifer (Keitel), whose other two sons leave hell in search of fun 'up north' in New York City. Their journey magically breaks the gates of hell, or something, and as a result this causes the Devil to wither away. Nicky is left as the only possible source of salvation, having to travel north, bring his evil brothers back and save his dying father (how does someone in hell die? Don't ask me.).The movie has a few clever gags for movie buffs &#150; Elephant Man and Scarface references being the best, if not very subtle. The film's problem is that it quickly runs out of steam &#150; it's a one-trick pony and is only able to sustain its screwball antics for so long until it becomes a chore to sit through.One thing I have to give credit to Sandler for is that, although his comedies may not be perfect, most of the time they are somewhat amusing and aren't as commercially sloppy as Little Nicky. By that, I mean that this movie is a by-the-numbers Hollywood product &#150; it moves from Point A to Point B to Point C, introducing all the typical clichés of the genre. Sandler's comedies have always been weak in terms of romantic subplots &#150; the tacked-on relationship in Happy Gilmore was laughable, and Madison's was even worse. Didn't matter much because the films relied on jokes. Not here. Jokes are rare. The romantic subplot is the worst so far in any of his films &#150; I felt sorry for Arquette, and I was disturbed by how shallow her character was written. (She meets Nicky &#150; a muttering, mumbling, evil idiot &#150; in New York, treats him nice, goes out on a date, and then he swears at her and makes obscene gestures and tells her that he's the spawn of Satan and she gives a cute smile and goes on a magical Satan-powered flight across the city with him. Absolutely pathetic.)Characters are handled as throwaways &#150; Dangerfield's potentially-hilarious performance is watered down and never given full opportunity, showing up once and a while to add a few laughs to a flat sequence. Keitel's performance is weak and Sandler has once again created a grating voice &#150; Little Nicky sounds just like his geeky character from SNL who would show up on Weekend Updates to give music reports. A better comedian might really find a character to play underneath the surface &#150; Sandler isn't able to because, to be fair, he isn't much of a comedian. As a result his performance is painfully blunt &#150; about as subtle as a hammer over the head. Instead of playing a wacky, annoying person in his next movie, why doesn't he just play himself? That's what he's always been good at. There's a reason Happy Gilmore is still his best comedy, and Punch-Drunk Love was so great.The gratuitous cameos become almost as annoying as the constant merchandising tie-ins and references (I counted Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Popeye's Chicken, and the television show Felicity, not to mention the rock soundtrack that cuts back and forth to one song after another without using them to any real advantage). The cameos? That's Chubbs Peterson from Happy Gilmore ('It's all in the hips!') and Henry Winkler, apparently not reprising his role as the coach from The Waterboy. Those two were fun enough, but the Rob Schneider reprisal is lame &#150; having the same character show up time and time again to say the same thing ('You can do it!') isn't clever if he's annoying to begin with. The movie is one big Adam Sandler Celebration &#150; it references Gilmore, Madison, Waterboy, and even lines from the films (having said 'It's all in the hips!' about three times). Then there's the inclusion of characters from Sandler's music CDs &#150; mainly Whitey the Coach, who is played by Dana Carvey, and who was later voiced by Sandler in the animated flop 8 Crazy Nights.All in all the movie tries to be a number of different things and becomes absolutely nothing at all. It wants to be a social and religious satire but is content to stay within the PG-13 guidelines, so it never becomes as raunchy or funny or downright refreshing as Dogma. Kevin Smith is a daring director and is capable of extending the craziest of material into something clever. Steven Brill, the director of Little Nicky, is considerably less talented and as a result his movie &#150; which similarly moves towards an apocalyptic ending a la Dogma &#150; becomes a complete and under mess, totally predictable and stupid.Little Nicky is a big disappointment.

Unfortunately, neither Stiller nor Allen were involved with this movie, which in the final analysis, is much `less.'  As in `witless,' `tasteless' and `humorless.'  Oh, it'll make you laugh at times, but you'll hate yourself in the morning for it.  Simply put, in regards to credible comedy, `Little Nicky,' directed by Steven Brill, comes in somewhere near the bottom of the food chain, cinematically speaking.  One of the running gags in this film has Nicky responding metaphorically to whomever, when they ask where he comes from, `The south-- the &#145;deep' south--'  Which is somehow ironic, because that's exactly where this kind of humor seemingly originates, and belongs.	Satan (Harvey Keitel) has come to the end of his ten-thousand year reign in Hell, and has called together his three sons, Adrian (Rhys Ifans), Cassius (Tom `Tiny' Lister Jr.) and Little Nicky (Adam Sandler), to announce which of the three he has chosen to succeed him as ruler of the Nether world for the next ten-thousand years.  Suffice to say that his decision is not well received by the boys, however-- at least not by Adrian and Cassius, who rebel by bolting from this most southern of regions to take up residence in the topside world of the mortals, the souls of whom it is their inherent duty to corrupt.  But in so doing, they inadvertently freeze the fire at the gates of Hell, rendering them impassable to all the fallen souls who would enter there; and so it is destined to remain until the two return, which they are not likely to do of their own accord.  The situation quickly takes it's toll on the health of Satan, who in his suddenly weakened state is unable to pursue the errant pair himself, and since only a spawn of Satan can match up to another spawn of Satan, the job falls to Little Nicky-- the only other one around who meets the criteria-- who is summarily dispatched to earth to collect his brothers and bring them back down to Hell, whereupon the fire will be rekindled, the gates reopened, and all will once again be...well...'bad.'  It's a tough assignment, though, as Nicky's brothers have the ability to possess anyone in the world they so choose, which will make identifying them something of a problem.  Not to worry, however; Satan is providing some help for Nicky-- a dog named Mr. Beefy (voice of Robert Smigel), who has experience among the mortals, and will be able to help Nicky negotiate what to him will be virgin territory.  And with that, Nicky is off on his quest-- and the laughs begin.  Not!	The story itself is a flight of fancy, a fantasy, which on paper at any rate probably had some possibilities; if only it had been placed in more capable hands.  Brill was given a golden opportunity to deliver a movie with some real snap and zing to it, but he dropped the ball, big time, and instead presents the material with little imagination, and the result is a very basic what-you-see-is-what-you-get type of film.  There's just nothing beneath the surface at all.  Sure, it's a comedy (and that's debatable), but even a film that's not supposed to be taken seriously has to have some substance to it, and this one does not.  It almost seems as if Brill approached the project with the attitude that Adam Sandler's presence, alone, would make whatever he put up on the screen work.  Bad miscalculation.  Scenes that could have been clever, or at least mined for some real humor, are for the most part simply crude, and in most cases lack any redeeming merit whatsoever.  His biggest mistake, though, was putting all his eggs in one basket by expecting Sandler to carry the day (and the film) just by showing up.  He apparently didn't understand that Sandler is an actor who needs a director who can keep him on task-- he needs direction, and plenty of it-- and he didn't get it from Brill.	Sandler has been better-- much better; as Robbie, in `The Wedding Singer,' for instance, or even as Bobby, in `The Waterboy.'  Both films in which he created a character that was at least credible or viable within the context of the story.  But his `Nicky' just doesn't get the job done, because he fails to even really create a character at all, but instead `plays at' creating a character, which is something else entirely.  Someone-- and the most likely suspect would be Brill-- should have told him that merely contorting his face and exaggerating the perpetually pubescent whine in his voice is not what it takes to `create' a real character.  And, regardless of the genre in which the actor is playing, it's absolutely essential that the character he presents is real and believable within the environment and the setting of the story.  If he's playing a devil in Hell, that devil had better be real, or it's simply not going to work; and this film proves it.  And lowering the bar to go after cheap laughs can't save it, either. 	The supporting cast includes Rodney Dangerfield (Lucifer), Patricia Arquette (Valerie), Peter Dante (Peter), Jonathan Loughran (John), Dana Carvey (Referee), Jon Lovitz (Peeper), Kevin Nealon (Gatekeeper), Michael McKean (Chief of Police), Quentin Tarantino (Deacon) and Reese Witherspoon (Holly).  A real artist will earn every laugh he gets, and it's genuine; it's something real, and it's worthwhile.  This film generates some laughs, to be sure-- but they're not earned, and consequently, they're plastic, and they're disposable.  And yes, there IS a difference.  Any doubts, just ask Ben Stiller or Woody Allen.  Or Steve Martin; or Lucille Ball, Joan Davis, Red Skelton or W.C. Fields.  And while you're at it, maybe you can pass on what you learn to Adam Sandler.  It may help.  1/10.

Adams brothers are particularly good, as is Adam himself, but the film lacks something.Certainly not as good as 'Waterboy' or 'Happy Gilmore' but worth a watch anyway.

They come close, but with the power of good VS evil, only one may win. I'm going to give it away, but there was a good enough plot where it keeps you entertained and laughing most of the way through.By the time this movie came out, Sandler was a comic powerhouse, but was always known as the loner with the heart of gold. His role in this film doesn't change much, but his speech does. In fact it's so unlike Sandler that I think it might throw people off a bit. Anyways, the speech doesn't really matter.He's brought his friends from other movies (Jonathon Loughran & Peter Dante) and they play a good role for them in this one, as fans of heavy metal and Satan himself. There was a talking dog (that didn't really need to be there), but it's almost as if Steven Brill, the director (also of Without A Paddle and Mr. Deeds directing jobs), wanted to reach outside of what was possible and bring out all of the CGI wonderment that some directors (like this one) went overboard with. I don't think you could've easily did the effects on this movie without computer-enhancement everywhere, bu it does feel a bit much after awhile.More than anything, the movie is the same as all of Sandler's because of one thing trying to make the audience have a good time. It had recognizable pop-metal music, great gags in between serious points in the movie, and even cameos by great stars (Ozzy Osbourne, Henry Winkler, Regis Philbin, Bill Walton, Dan Marino). It sucks that Dustin Hoffman was replaced by Harvey Keitel as Satan, but all of the comical characters made up for whatever could have been.Overall, I had to give the movie a 6/10 because although it was fun to watch, it did get over-the-top seeing the effects used so much, and the plot almost became every other Sandler film. It was a good change of pace and format, though which is why this is still above average. Go out and rent it, or flat out buy it if you're a Sandler fan like me; the DVD features are spectacular, too.My favorite thing actually was the montage at the end where it revealed that Chris Farley ended up being the dance instructor up in heaven in the future. Too true.

But as usual, it is a little too overloaded with honey to be rated as a truly funny film.I don't think it is quite as good as Happy Gilmore, but I might be biased because I both hate gold and love hockey.

Little Nicky was no exception, but ultimately it feels that perhaps the critics are looking for too much from this film.In Little Nicky Sandler plays the title role who, as the son of the Devil is forced to travel to Earth and capture his two evil brothers before they cause the Devil's death. Along the way Nicky encounters some unusual people and even falls in love.When critics condemn this film, it feels like they are expecting too much. Whilst there are films out there which attempt to be serious and can be condemned for being awful, in the case of Little Nicky, Sandler never takes himself seriously and never seems to want us to take him seriously either. This film is designed to present us with a daft comedy which draws on a few cult references and a few guest cameos. This is all it wants to do, and in that respect it passes with flying colours. There are certain jokes (a scene involving Chicago and the majority of scenes involving two metal fans who follow Nicky around for example) which are hilarious and which could make anyone laugh. The soundtrack is quality too. With AC/DC, Ozzy and other legends of Rock, Sandler has constructed a playlist which would be at home at the Ozzfest Festival.I won't ever think that this film is worthy of awards. The acting is average (Tarantino's cameo and Keitel being two of the few highlights) and the plot is nothing amazing. When analysing a film though, there should be a distinction between films that WANT to win awards and those which don't. With Little Nicky, it is blatant that Sandler wanted to make us laugh and had no concern with awards. In this respect he succeeds. If you want to relax and mellow out to a funny film with an amazing soundtrack, watch this film. If you want to watch an Oscar potential, look elsewhere.

Sandler's character, Nicky, is one of the three sons of Satan (Harvey Keitel)--the other two being Adrian (Rhys Ifans), and Cassius (Tom Lister Jr.). Satan decides to stay on his throne for another 10,000 years. Angered by this, Adrian and Cassius leave Hell to go to New York, and with the portal to Hell damaged, Satan begins to deteriorate. Nicky has to go up to New York to bring Adrian and Cassius back to Hell, boarding with a dog (voiced by Robert Smigel) and an actor (Allen Covert) and falling in love with a woman (Patricia Arquette) along the way. Sandler dons a stupid facial expression and a speech impediment for Little Nicky, and unfortunately that's supposed to come off as funny. Without the sarcasm and satire of Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, Little Nicky is a regrettable collection of stupid one-liners and physical comedy. The performances are strictly meh, with Sandler and Arquette being average at best and Ifans and Smigel being terribly one-dimensional. Keitel is great as the Devil, though. The movie is loaded with cameos, the highlights being Jon Lovitz as a peeping tom, Rodney Dangerfield as Lucifer, and Quentin Tarantino as a blind street preacher. Overall, however, I wouldn't see the film more than once and I wouldn't buy it.

That's a funny tagline, I say!  The rest of it looks like Adam Sandler and his buddies took too many drugs and forgot to go over the ideas they came up with while they were on drugs later on while not on drugs to make sure they would be funny to people viewing the film later who themselves may or may not be on drugs.  Oddly, and I can't explain it really, but I have a weird feeling that this movie is going to age well.  In five or six years I think Little Nicky will look better and will seem funnier.

This is a bad one, folks. I don't know where I was the night the body snatchers came down and an entire generation woke up the next morning thinking Adam Sandler was funny.  How could anything other than a brain-washing explain the public letting this guy film and release every stupid idea that pops into his head.  Maybe Little Nicky is just bad enough to snap everyone out of it.The first problem comes right from the start. This guy has been telling, basically, the exact same story since Billy Madison. He plays exactly 2 characters the straight-up, prone to violence but likeable yuppie (Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, Mr. Deeds) and the likable retard with the baby voice (Billy Madison, The Waterboy, Little Nicky).  For chrissake even the titles are all the same- Billy Madison/Happy Gilmore (names), The Wedding Singer/The Waterboy (professions), Big Daddy/Little Nicky. Did they plan this?One fundamental difference here is his movies are usually low, budget people flicks. Little Nicky is an end-of-the-world special effects flick done on Sandler's shoestring budget. The look of the film is ghastly.  The colors are dreary, camera work static and there isn't a moment where we believe anything we're seeing.  There are giant birds that are obviously men in costumes and rabbits that are obviously stuffed.  Stuffed! This is 2001, we've brought dinosaurs to life and travelled to the future and these guys are trying to pass off bunnies with buttons for eyes.  This lead me to a realization.  It occured to me halfway through- staring at this half computer animated, half papier-mache set of Hell - Little Nicky is a kid's movie.  I'm talking Nickelodeon, Barney and Power Rangers.See, while Sandler movies are known for being crude and violent- it's all style.  The substance is actually extremely safe. He doesn't want to do anything that might actually be daring or rock the boat in any way. He is clearly so desperate for our approval he hangs every gag on the greater good preaching what is right and wrong.  For example, Jon Lovitz appears in the intro as a peeping tom. When he goes to Hell and is punished we continually hear him yell I deserve this. It's like saying Hey kids, don't be a peeping tom. Also, he makes his heros underdogs because that's clearly the only way he can relate to the audience- the bigger the retard, the scratchier and more obnoxious the voice, the more the audience will pull for him goes the theory.  That said it's strange this is a movie about God, Satan and the afterlife- subjects that if handled well have inspired some of the best, most daring films in recent years.  Sandler glosses over these subjects without a second thought. Exploring them might offend somebody. Remember, Little Nicky comes just a year after Catholic groups protested Kevin Smith's brilliant, thought provoking and wildly imaginative Dogma without having seen that film.Most of the story is propped up on a slew of cameos. Director Steven Brill (let's pass the blame around) assumes the mear appearance of Ozzy Osbourne or Rob Schneider's face will get laughs. Nickey features a bunch of rejects from the worst years of Saturday Night Live stumbling around in embarassing costumes waiting for the check to clear.  Aside from the fact that it's painfully unfunny, the jokes don't even seem honest. The movie is bookended with a sight gag involving Adolf Hitler getting punished in Hell. Apparently, for gassing 6 million Jewes, Hitler spends an eternity forced to wear a french maid's uniform while getting pinapple enemas.  That evens the score. I wonder if Sandler and his cronies even think this stuff is funny or are just giving the audience what they think we want to see.Biggest Negatives the visuals, jokes that aren't jokes, the typical Adam Sandler stuff.Biggest Positive Reese Witherspoon.  The only reason to see this movie. She's gorgeous.

DO NOT RENT Little Nicky. Go out and rent a GOOD Sandler flick like The Wedding Singer, dig up your old Saturday Night Live videos of Sandler as Opera Man or Peter Brady, or even watch old re-runs of The Cosby Show where you might catch a young Adam Sandler as Theo's pal, Smitty. Whatever you do, promise me you'll think twice about going to see Nicky.   Title-character Nicky (Sandler) is one of three spawns of Satan (Harvey Keitel), living in Hell (literally), getting kicked around by his two older brothers, Adrian and Cassius (Tom Tiny Lister, from Friday fame), and generally just trying to be a good evil son to his father. After evil Dad denies them the right to take over Hell once his 10,000-year reign has come to a close, Adrian and Cassius decide to take their anger up to Earth -- at the same time, freezing the portal to the flaming gateway to Hell. Unfortunately now that the gateway is frozen, there are no more souls to feed Satan (and keep in mind, this is a BAD thing), so his body slowly begins to deteriorate (a finger flops off here, an ear is shed there, etc.) It's now up to Nicky to bring his brothers back home before his father rots away.   Faced with fast-moving public transportation, a Jack-Nicholson-mimicking mutt named Beefy (Nicky's earthly guide), a retentively stuck-up actor for a roommate, and a growing love interest in homely-looking Patricia Arquette, Nicky finds it difficult just staying alive, much less retrieving his satanic sibs and saving Hell. Yeah, it's confusing to me, too, why anyone would care enough to save Hell, but I'll chalk it up to It's an ADAM SANDLER movie -- I'm supposed to be ENJOYING this. Yeah... whatever.While Nicky does have its moments (the cameos in this thing are unbelievable!), there's little excuse for this movie. It's like watching a long, drawn out, really dumb Rodney Dangerfield joke -- complete with RODNEY DANGERFIELD (as Grandpa Lucifer I might add)! What seems to start off well and amusingly so turns into a hodge-podge of weak (and surprisingly archaic) one-liners, jokes the size of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man coming down Fifth Avenue, and THE most annoying assault on the auditory senses... Adam Sandler's voice-choice for Nicky. Think Renfield from the original Dracula (1931) crossed with Baron von's assistant from Frankenstein (1931). I could only take so much of either character when I saw both films... and they came back to haunt me in this one throughout its ENTIRETY. Might as well have been in Hell, let alone sitting through a movie about it.

However, he's also made a lot of crap. For every good film like THE WEDDING SINGER or THE WATERBOY, he's made lame films like an unnecessary remake like MR. DEEDS (with Sandler having the nerve to try to replicate a film classic that starred the great Gary Cooper) as well as LITTLE NICKY. Sure, there are a few films that fall towards the middle (CLICK comes to mind), but in general his films tend to either be very good or very, very bad. I am a high school teacher and can tell you that most kids seem to like all of Sandler's films, but if he ever wants to address a wider audience or be seen as an artist and not a buffoon, a few more films like LITTLE NICKY will kill these dreams forever! Of course, he's richer than the Pope, so perhaps he doesn't mind that he often makes crap.Why is LITTLE NICKY so bad? Well, the biggest problem is that is just isn't very funny and often substitutes dirty and smarmy material for real laughs. While making a comedy about Satan and Hell is already a tough job, it could have come off much, much better (such as the case of BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY). Here, it just seems like a film written by 7 year-olds--the sort of kids that might find Bevis and Butthead's humor a bit too sophisticated and cerebral!! Crude jokes (such as an obnoxious and sexually obsessed dog as well as a scene where demons shove pineapples into Hitler's rectum) almost always fall flat and at almost no time does the script head towards the clever or the funny. It's just crude and nasty.Low, stupid and completely without value. Heaven help us, a lot of people amazingly think this is a GOOD film!! Look at all the people who actually gave this crud a score of 10 and act as if it's comparable to films such as GONE WITH THE WIND or DR. STRANGELOVE!!! This is ample evidence that, in general, people are stupid and will pay to see anything! In addition, the fact that people like this is proof that the predictions in the film IDIOCRACY aren't too far from true today!By the way, you might find it very interesting to look at the statistics for the ratings. About as many people loved it as hated it. However, if you look by demographics such as age, you'll see that the older you get, the more likely you'll hate the film.

I always enjoyed his goofball persona on `Saturday Night Live' with his doofus characters and wacky song parodies.  Heck I even remember his recurring stint as `Stud Boy' (among others) on the cult MTV game show `Remote Control'.  But I also have to admit his onscreen persona I can only deal with in spurts and that I must say the only film of his I actually enjoyed was `The Wedding Singer' and parts of `Big Daddy'.  Well I'm glad to admit that his latest rises just above the latter and falls a hair short of the former. Sandler stars as the eponymous character a son of Satan (Keitel, who bares an uncanny resemblence to the atypical icon of Beezlebub himself) who is having his share of sibling rivalry when his squabbling, nastier brothers Adrian (Ifans, best known as Hugh Grant's skanky roomie in `Notting Hill') and Cassius (Lister, cockeyed strongman and former wrestler), who are both plotting to take over their dad's supreme reign after his 10,000 year stint as The Prince of Darkness.When Satan decides to stick around for 10K more the two angered sons escape from Hades upsetting the balance of Heaven & Hell and all points in between causing their perplexed papa to unhinge (literally).  It's up to his ne'er-do-well, yet doting Nicky to go to Earth and bring back his bros. Naturally the closest city to almighty damnation alley has to logically be New York where Nicky finds a bit unsettling and inhospitable (after several run-ins with Metro Transit killing him, hurtling him back to Hell and then returning like some sort of metaphysical pinball) until his dad sets him up with a tour guide, Mr. Beefy, an English bulldog (voiced by Conan O' Brien's head writer and creative producer Smigel) who helps the misguided AntiChrist through the pitfalls of Manhattan to fulfill his quest. Nicky finds a roomie, Todd (Covert), a gay actor who doesn't immediately see him for who he really is; is befriended by two dumb and dumber metal head/devil's advocate wannabes John ande Peter (Loughran and Dante); and falls in love for the first time with the mousy Valerie (Arquette). His brothers waste no time in taking over The Big Apple by possessing different souls to enact their nefarious plot of the netherworld including among other things lowering the drinking age to 10 and changing the state's moto to `I Love Hookers'. Nicky clearly has his hands full and must flex his hibernated evil (with help from Beefy) his first act is changing a Coke into a Pepsi. The film is pretty funny from start to finish with many great sequences,particularly how Hell is depicted as a haven for atomic wedgies and just dessert punishments (peeper Lovitz' is attacked for all eternity by a giant horny bird).  The cast seems to be having a ball with some equally funny moments like discovering the back masking of Chicago's `Does Anyone Know What Time It Is?' with the secret message to worship the Dark One; Nicky taking on Adrian (in the persona of Carvey as an elderly referee) during a Harlem Globetrotter game); Dangerfield as Grandpa Lucifer cracking wise; director Tarantino as a crazed blind street preacher and finally one of the best high concept endings since `Ghostbusters' ' 100 ft. StaPuft Marshmallow Man involving a kick ass bout between Adrian and Nicky and involving Osbourne (to say anymore would spoil the clever result). Sandler, adopting a hunched, disfiguring scowl and a Peter Lorre on Ectasy lisp, makes it difficult at times to understand let alone be tolerated but his able supporting cast carries him along effortlessly.  Co-written by himself and his usual gang of conspirators Tim Herlihy and director Brill the comedy survives with its well-placed verbal and sight gags that succeed for the most part (particularly Beefy, the horniest horn dog since Smigel's other creation, Triumph The Insult Comic Rottweiller on `Late Night'). It would be too easy for me to appease Sandler's rabid fans to say go to hell, but what the hell, go ahead.and laugh yourself silly.

This is the first time I have gone to a movie and actually become ANGRY watching a comedy. I only thank god I did not pay to see this. And look I am dumbing this movie down on the Adam Sander level. I have not expected much from Adam Sandler movies.. I have NOTHING against the guy.I mean I like Adam Sandler. I just find his movies OK.. but leave it to him to not even reach the absolutely 1 one millionth of an inch bar that has been set. If reaching the bar for this movie was a inch high.. he would be digging under ground for 2 miles.Trying to describe the movie does not do its futility justice. No words, phrases, interpolative dances or biblical scrawling have yet to be invented to describe the absolute time decaying event that is sitting through this film. I only watched it because I knew that i was truly in the moment of history.. a cinematic event on the level of the Hindenburg crashing.Its seemed as if the four horsemen of the Apocalypse rode through the screen laughing and exalting your every minute as you sat through each frame decaying frame after another. If films had a smell, this film would reek of absolute desolation and despair. If failure had a smell it would be this film. I looked at it in wonder as if why would someone put this train wreck on film..why because we are someone what drawn to human tragedy.. well I cant answer those question.. Biblical scholars and Pyscholgist can better explain the deep corners of the mind that this film tends to attack.In closing NO FILM can try to be as bad as little Nicky .. films can only come close to being as bad as this film was. we have hit the Rosetta stone of absolute cinematic failure..And hopefully those of us who have seen it came away without having our eyes bleed and our bodies turned to stone. And for that reason if you want to see the benchmark for futility.. you should see this film.. just so you can know how bad a film can be. Thank god I survived....or did i?

Little Nicky is the end of the line for Sandler's long string of great comedies.This is one of the most offensive comedies I have seen because of his inane body gestures, stupid jokes and miscast actors. I left the theater asking myself what could he be thinking by making this film.One of the most confusing aspects about Little Nicky was the consistency in jumping from one subject to the other without focusing on any one particular subject. Instead, Sandler recruits Harvey Keitel, Rodney Dangerfield, Allen Covert, Reese Witherspoon, Patricia Arquette and Rhys Ifans to star in this painful excuse of a film. These fine actors made the biggest mistake of their careers as they signed on to participate in Little Nicky. Little Nicky is another reason why movie studios should pay closer and much more careful attention to the films they make. Also, they should re-examine the standards for films without a plot containing substance characters en developed to its fullest potential and screenplays that seem to be written without much effort.Little Nicky revolves around the life of Nicky, the son of the devil,who must travel above ground to capture his brothers as they create havoc. While above ground, Nicky meets a beautiful girl and makes new friends, which creates difficulties for him as he tries to accomplish his mission. Little Nicky made me feel so sleepy I almost fell into a coma.There is a difference between silly comedy and stupid comedy; unfortunately, Little Nicky fails to reach the level of great comedy because all of the comedy is offensive. From the body gestures to the jokes, I felt sick watching this film. I can almost guarantee that people would not have seen Little Nicky if they knew it was a senseless comedy. This is not a trait that people will find attractive.Little Nicky lost its credibility and right to be called a comedy because of its many problems, inconsistencies and stupid comedy. I lost respect for this film when it became clear the cast and crew were relying on stupid comedy for its success.The only tolerable aspect of Little Nicky was the appearances of Dangerfield and Keitel because they played the most interesting characters in the movie. I hope this film won't hurt their careers to much.I have always been a fan of Sandler's films, so it came as a shock when I saw this film because I thought he would produce much better than this. Sandler films such as The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy, Big Daddy and Bulletproof gave me reason to smile because I knew he didn't have to try hard to make me laugh; something Little Nicky did and failed. Sandler IS a great comedian; however, he has failed to make me laugh with Little Nicky. Arquette is an actress who is wasted in her role because she has no support around her. I have had the pleasure to watch actress on screen who adds so much to each film she takes part in, so I had to ask myself why she decided to sign on for this role. From beauty and charm to screen presence, Arquette has created a repertoire that will make everyone smile with talents she uses in each film she stars in; however, she fails to convince me that her performance was great. I know she has the ability to come back from this mistake and rebound from this awful film; my only concern is if Little Nicky will be the first or last in this streak of bad career choices.I wish I had the option to watch Little Nicky for free because if I had known that it was this bad I would keep my wallet in my pocket and urge everyone to stay away from this film.My advice to every movie fan is to stay away from this movie and keep your money or spend it on a film worthwhile.

Well, I'm part of the minority that thinks that this movie was neither really good nor bad; it was funny, and as far as I'm usually concerned, that alone makes a comedy worth watching. But the production values, direction, editing, dialogue, etc were not very good, and people have a right to not like a movie with problems like these.So what was good about it? It was just a lot of fun, the way bad movies sometimes can be. The cast is top-notch; even heavyweights like Harvey Keitel (as the devil, and he did a superb job), Patricia Arquette, and Reese Witherspoon (hilarious as a valley girl angel) seem to be having a great time here. The regulars from other Adam Sandler movies are also entertaining, and the cast is rounded out by a veritable who's who of comedy talent, like Jon Lovits, Rodney Dangerfield (basically doing his usual schtick as Lucifer, the devil's father), Kevin Nealon, Dana Carvey, George Wallace, Michael McKean, Ellen Cleghorne, Clint Howard... sure most of these people are washed up, but who cares? They're still funny; Jon Lovits in particular shows how good he is in these small parts (something he's done many times in the past). Robert Smigel is also good as the voice of Beefy the dog. Rounding it out are Rhys Ifans (who I'm not really familiar with) and Tiny Lister (inspired casting!) as Nicky's brothers, a host of cameos, many of whom play themselves (Regis and Ozzy are hilarious, and Henry Winkler and Carl Weathers appear, referencing older Adam Sandler movies), and of course Sandler himself as Little Nicky, the devil's nicer son. As I said before, the cast is great; they seem to be having a really good time, and they are really what make the movie worth watching. You can forgive the movie the bad dialogue and poor production values if it's this funny.I think above all, it's important to just try not to take the movie so seriously. Although the dialogue is bad, the one-liners are often hilarious, and although the production values are bad, the sight gags are often hilarious. So enjoy the movie for what it is an entertaining, if not well-done, piece of fluff, along the lines of, say, Cheech and Chong, not up to the quality of Sandler's other movies (and I stand by that, I think there is real quality in movies like The Wedding Singer or Happy Gilmore or even The Waterboy), but still pretty damn funny in it's own right.

For the amount of special effects and cameos in it, I could have made a movie about heaven and hell 20,000 times better than this bunk and for 1/3rd the price. Sandler's worst movie; even though he's never going to make a Citizen Kane,  that still says a lot. As an alternative, go rent Happy Gilmore and fast forward to Bob Barker calling Sandler a bitch. 3 out of 10. Grade F.

He plays one of the Devil's (Harvey Keitel--why Harvey??) sons who is sent to Earth to bring back his brothers who are intent on taking over the world.  He's also given a talking dog to help him.  You know you're in trouble when the dog is giving the best performance.All the jokes are sick (how did this get a PG-13?), degrading, homophobic and sexist.  Sandler never could act and Keitel looks desperate to get out of there.  When you have Rodney Dangerfield do a cameo and even HE isn't funny there's something terribly terribly wrong.  I had to turn this off after half an hour--my stomach couldn't take any more.  A utter piece of garbage.  Even Sandler fans didn't see this when it came out.  What does that tell you?

And it is. Starring him as the weird-voiced son of Satan (Harvey Keitel) going to New York to find his brothers (Rhys Ifans and Tiny Lister) who fled Hell and stopped sinners from entering, there's everything that one would expect - except that I didn't expect to see Rodney Dangerfield as Lucifer. It's the sort of movie that you only see if you're ready for sheer goofy nonsense. As it was, this was one of several devil-related movies released in 2000, although the Exorcist re-release was the only other one worth seeing. Also starring Patricia Arquette, Jon Lovitz, Kevin Nealon, Reese Witherspoon, and Henry Winkler.

This movie was fkn *hilarious*. If critics pan it, and if fat-boy Ebert goes on his late-night show and gripes about the fact that his precious time had to be wasted watching the flick,and people don't watch this movie because of that, that is a true shame.  Don't believe those dumb critics. Who can respect a fat, bald old man who gets paid heaps just to review a movie for a YOUNGER audience he will NEVER understand? Critics are like cops. Most of them have to attack one thing. Just like cops'll go after kids with long hair, or dark skin, critics have tried to be AGAINST movies they think will make considerably less money than others, or movies they just plain don't understand. Just look at the reviews for <There's Something About Mary>. Yeah, don't *those* critics feel like idiots now.   The point I'm trying to get here is, no this Sandler movie doesn't look low-budget; it looks high-budget. It's not even his best movie, in my opinion. But you know what? It's a damn-good movie. It reflects Sandler's humour with the usual cool style. Believe me, *anyone* is a fan of Sandler movies will really like this movie. And I'm not being paid to say this.-Sep "}{"Title":"Lame humor--most of it scatological--permeates an effects-laden comedy which typecasts Sandler as the Devil's spawn","Date":"25 June 2010","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Dreadful bubblegum stuff for the heavy metal set. Satan (Harvey Keitel, with horns and pointy ears) passes over his two eldest sons for a promotion; they escape from Hell (to New York City!) and freeze the fires of Hades behind them so no new souls can enter in. Adam Sandler, talking in a raspy whisper (and with an occasional drooping lip), is the youngest spawn of the Devil who goes after his brothers to capture their souls in a flask forever. Despite a handsome production full of expensive CGI effects, big set pieces, and surprise guests in cameos, this Adam Sandler vehicle has no new jokes and plenty of obvious targets. Even with the large budget and a strong supporting cast, Sandler still can't shake off the doldrums and give us a comic performance he believes in. Little Nicky backs itself into a hoary corner, winding up with a showdown between evil and not-so-evil that raises not a single chuckle. Movies like this go over well with audiences who don't mind being treated like dolts. * from **** "},{"Title":"The Movie Was GREAT!","Date":"5 July 2006","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" If you are interested in seeing more of Adam Sandler's movies, then you would totally enjoy this movie! Also, feel free to go and see Click, now in theaters. Little Nicky is a story to where there is a mother and a father, but the mother is an angel, and the father is the devil. A lot of mishap goes on throughout the majority of the movie, so you better be careful what you wish for! Anyways, when Nicky Sandler meets this normal earth girl, everything starts to get even more crazy for him. They end up falling in love and having a kid that shoots flames out of his mouth. In the end, Nicky is then put in charge of earth, while his mother and father control heaven and hell. Enjoy the show!

Not only do I hate Adam Sandler in this movie, I hated the movie itself. Look it had a great concept, really original if somewhat bizarre, and served as a perfect basis for a funny if not groundbreaking comedy. So what was the excuse for such tasteless, inane dialogue, vulgar and grotesque humour and slack direction? Or that it looked as though it had been shot on a cheap studio set, had a clumsy soundtrack, poor pacing and worst of all the unforgivable waste of actors such as Harvey Keitel, Michael McKean and Rhys Ifans? Adam Sandler is at his most unlikeable here too, doing nothing but moronic schtick that we have seen many times before and better. Overall, just awful and a waste of time, for me that is. 1/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Little In The Way Of Entertainment","Date":"28 January 2003","Score":"2 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  I`ve been hearing a lot of hype involving Adam Sandler`s career over the last couple of years but having seen Sandler for the first time in this movie I realised that`s all Sandler is - Hype .There`s very little in the way of good things I can say about LITTLE NICKY , okay I`m not keen on comedy but that`s hardly an excuse for not liking this film . Sandler`s idea of comedy seems to be putting on an incredibly irritating voice and a silly walk and hoping the audience will find all this side splitting . Well I`m sorry but I didn`t . Mind you all the supporting cast like Harvey Keitel , Rhys Ifans and Rodney Dangerfield are equally unfunny so maybe the fault lies at the feet of the director than Sandler , but I`ll be very wary in future in watching a film that has the name of Adam Sandler in the credits  "},{"Title":"Little Nicky","Date":"13 June 2006","Score":"0 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" I saw this film once before, many people have low opinions of it, so not remembering any of it I decided it was a good idea to watch it again, from Razzie nominated director Steven Brill (Without a Paddle). Basically Satan, aka Dad (Harvey Keitel) may decide to stand down as ruler of Hell, since he has done it for 10,000 years, and he has to choose on of his three sons to take his place, smart and devious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), cruel and cunning Cassius (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister Jr.) or wonky mouthed and not very evil Nicky (Razzie nominated Adam Sandler). After deciding to stay on the throne Adrian and Cassius are angered, so they go to Earth, possessing the minds of many important religious and political figures of New York, and freezing over the entrance to Hell so no more souls can enter, causing Dad's body to decompose. It is up to Nicky to go to Earth and stop his brothers from creating Hell on Earth and save his father from disappearing completely, he can only do this putting them both in a flask and bringing them back at the same time. If Nicky dies on Earth he will only end up back in Hell and having go back again, but he does his best after it happening once to not let it happen again, of course he is not very good, even with help of his talking bulldog guide Mr. Beefy (Robert Smigel). As Nicky tries to carry out his task he unintentionally his some of his attention drawn towards slightly kooky design student Valerie Veran (Razzie nominated Patricia Arquette), but he does carry on trying to find his brothers, and realise his inner evil. There is a point when he gets to meet his mother, ever young beautiful angel Holly (Reese Witherspoon), who gives him good advice about how to defeat Adrian and Cassius, using his inner light, and by the end he does get to use this and save his father and Hell. Also starring Rodney Dangerfield as Lucifer, Quentin Tarantino as Deacon, Jon Lovitz as Peeper, Razzie nominated Rob Schneider as The Townie, Clint Howard as Nipples, Henry Winkler and Ozzy Osbourne. Sandler is as usual the moron, his wonky mouth thing is a bit of a one giggle constant joke and his stupidity naturally shows, and some of the supporting cast members, like Ifans and Dangerfield, do get some good moments and lines. It is a bit of stupid and crass film mocking religion and moral standards, and you may feel the special effects could have been to better use, but it is not a terrible film at all, you may giggle at a few good spots, an alright comedy. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Okay! "}]
