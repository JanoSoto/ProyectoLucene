It made the film look like a fascinating and powerful police drama.  The film however did not get even close to the expectations of the trailer. It wasn't bad however.  Just not great.  Stephen Baldwin (The Usual Suspects, Fled) stars as a police officer whose best friends are all involved in the Mob.  Despite a great record, he gets framed by Internal Affairs and has to decide between his friends or his job.  Chris Penn (Deceiver, The Funeral) is very good in support as Baldwin's very much in debt partner.  Gina Gershon (Face/Off, Palmetto) is ok as the love interest.  But the film's biggest strength lies in Stephen Baldwin.  Baldwin is one of the most underrated actors in my mind (mainly because of poor career choices), but here he delivers a strong performance that brings the film through all of its predictability.  Recommended for Baldwin's performance mainly.

I confess, I heard him on the Howard Stern Show, and thought he was notes, but the movie is tightly and carefully plotted and the characters were believable.  If the film has a fault, the plot is almost too tight.  Good performances by Stephen Baldwin, Gina Gershon, and Mike McGlone.  I liked the opening sequence okay as well.

Therefore it cannot begin to compare to flicks like SERPICO and even COPLAND, which for whatever faults these films may have, they are real movies.  This plays flat, with ineptly staged scenes and bad acting, just like a TV movie or most TV shows.  I can think of no earthly reason to recommend this, unless you want to see Stevie B. playing a tough-as-a-tissue cop.

Everything about this exercise in based on a true story story is thin and that keeps it from viewer investment and creative consummation.There is a checklist of standard, gritty, crime solving with slim motivational backing. Laid out in front are the misunderstood macho, but sensitive, officer with a self-destructive partner in a corrupt system. He is unable to separate lifelong childhood friendships with Mobsters from professional duty.This is the crux of this Crime Drama that is betrayed by speechifying and stiff setups. It is not a bad Movie, just one that demands more depth of insight and frankly, more involvement by the Writer and Director if they are to approach such a complicated scenario. Solving heinous crimes and the dismantling of a seasoned, successful law enforcement street Cop requires much more than this quickly moving and uneven attempt.

The fact that they are all mobsters gives the FBI an opportunity to blackmail him into working for them. He refuses and almost loses his badge.Stephen Baldwin (The Usual Suspects) play Dietl, trying to stay clear of the slime played by Amy Irving and Victor Slezak. Why she would take that role is beyond me. It stunk! Of course, we have to have a hot babe, and who better to play that role that Gina Gershon (Bound, Love Matters, Sweet Revenge).It was interesting seeing Captain Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) playing a gangster role.Based on a true character, it was OK, but you can probably find something better to watch.

Their complicity draws the attention of FBI... Inspired by the life of the policeman Bo Dietl, this muscular whodunit interpreted by Stephen Baldwin (The Usual Suspects) brushes a bitter and violent picture of the daily life in the New York police. The first quarter of an hour let augur a robust detective, bitter and restless film. But the continuation does not hold the initial promises. The intrigue, badly tied up, suffers from the Stephen Baldwin's transparent interpretation.

The book at least tell a better story as far as being a bit more honest and no real shoot'em up, even though I found some exaggeration on Mr. Bo Dietl's way of telling of his exploits a word, if I may add, that can be taken in two different ways, like always fighting off bad guys with knives, mano a mano. You can fool some of the people most of the times, but you can not fool the NYPD cops, or for that matter, cops in general. This movie should not be saying that it is based on a true story. The only true incident was the rape of the nun. But the apprehension of the two young men that committed this heinous crime was not the way it happened. Read the book and see what I mean. For one tough cop, Mr. Dietl should have told Hollywood about his other exploits as an NYPD cop. Apparently those stories did not merit being put into the script. So what happens? Fiction with a childhood friend of Bo's that becomes a mafia made man. To add insult to injury, another mafia made man goes after Bo's partner. Never happened. One tough cop? tsk, tsk, tsk, I don't think so.

This is the usual hero worship from an Ed McBain wannabe. No real plot, no production values to speak off, just a lot of actors who want to be part of an important story. And they should know better. I found it very difficult to care about _any_ of the characters in this turgid piece of cinema. And that's even though I like Stephen Baldwin, Chris Penn and Nora Gershon. It doesn't help that the protagonists are the usual Black nun-rapists on angel dust (or crack in this case - where did I see that before - Hill Street Blues), it doesn't help that Dietl is chumming up with the local maffia (Mike McGlone), who are ok after all, as they're just good Catholic boys from the hood. Does Mike McGlone as the local mafia hood do anything illegal other than kiss Stephen Baldwin and sit around in a restaurant looking unemployed? And what's with all this kissing stuff? I think Stephen Baldwin and Mike McGlone kiss at least three times throughout the movie?Something must be very rotten with the police, when they and the mafia are just a bunch of good old boys and the FBI fighting corruption are just out to get a small time, hardworking cop. Right. How mean of them. I guess they just don't understand. Check out the reviews of his book at Amazon.com to read the opinions of some (probably) real cops.In short, this is just one overly long ode to a nobody called Bo Dietl. Miss it.
