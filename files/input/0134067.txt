Do they think kids are hard-of-hearing? Are they trying to make kids deaf?Whatever. . I guess this is geared a lot more for young kids who are used to the TV blasting away at them. For me, that loudness is okay for awhile, but it gets tiresome. In fact, the simple storyline in here goes on for too long, too. This is an 81- minute film, which is not long, but would have been far better at no m ore than 70 minutes. An hour would have been just right.Still, on the plus side, there are plenty of interesting scenes, the colors are bright and visually attractive, the sound is very good and there are some decent subtleties as well as slapstick humor. There are things in here adults would enjoy.

Of course the film isn't without its flaws. The second half was rather loud for my liking, and while the story is simple, which is fine by me, there are bits where the film drags and it doesn't quite have the sense of fun that makes the show so enjoyable. That said though, the film is very, VERY cute and means well. While it is by all means a kids movie, there are a handful of laughs and references to other films for adults. I particularly loved Phil's I didn't know she could fly(in reference to Angelica) and Lil replies I think it's because she's a witch. The animation is colourful and true to that of the show, and the soundtrack is great. The voice cast is especially strong, with Tara Strong, EG Daily and Christine Cavanaugh as standouts. Though as much as it pains me to say this, great actors like Whoopi Goldberg and Tim Curry have very little to do, and did disappoint. Overall, it's a decent movie, it is colourful cute and fun, but does have a tendency to drag and a bit loud in places. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"A fun-tastic enhancement of the TV cartoon series.","Date":"19 April 1999","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  This animated film feature of the RUGRATS is a thrill of an adventurous joyride for its fans, and has a cutest sense of humor more unique than some in this type (like the poopie jokes).

A fun, up beat movie that kids and growned-ups will enjoy from start to finish.","Date":"20 November 1998","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The Rugrats Movie -*** out of 4.After months of waiting, I finally got the chance to see my favorite cartoon, the Rugrats on the silver screen. Ever since I was ten (and since the show began back in 1991), I have always loved the show. And let me tell you, Klasy-Cuspo did not let me down. A fun, up-beat movie that kids and growned-ups will enjoy from start to finish. I attended a 705pm showing of the film, the majority of the sold-out crowd were mainly tykes. Due to the fact that I'm 17-years old, it really set me down that I didn't see any other people close to my age other than Adults. At least I'm a kid at heart, and I can see whatever I please.The story picks off where The Family Tree left us. It begins with a sharp-looking Indiana Jones spoof, putting our main man Tommy Pickles in his shoes ready to snatch a prized possesion. Funny how imagination goes with these kids, as the huge rolling ball that chases them happens to be a very Pregnant Didi-Tommy's mom.Shortly after, Didi gives birth to Dil Pickles, which becomes a total bane to all the main Rugrats-Even Phil and Lil. Dil seems to be somewhat a very fussy little babe. During most of the film, Dil loves to take batting practice on Tommy's head (hitting), be it from a rattle or a bottle.After some discussion from twins Phil and Lil, they decide to take Dil back to the hopsickle. They do attempt to return him via a new Stu Invention-The Reptar Wagon. However, they get lost along the way, ending up in a forest, scary with monkeys and more troubles. This ain't the playpen folks.And what does that little imp Angelica (My favorite Rugrat) has to do with all of this? Since Dil loves to grab items, yelling mine!, her doll Cynthia is grabbed from the hands of the feisty younging. Angelica goes out under Shirley-Lock Holmes-donning roller-blades and all in order to retain her dolly. However I was disappointed with what they did to her. Angelica does not get a lot of screen time compared to her other counterparts. And Unlike the T.V. show, Angelica is much less of a brat, but she is more like it in the early moments of the film.Of course, the adults in the film are just as entertaining as the Rugrats. The reporter Rex Pester is really a pest. And Grandpa, Stu and Drew bring it on.The animation is really on another level. Really cool use during the birth scene. They really made some scenes 3-D like in appearance. And to be real with you, it looks like the animators took a shot of speed, as most of the movie speeds on by. It's not slow like most Disney films. It really has a small amount of sugar-sweet moments. Also the songs aren't at all chessy for an animated film.This being the first G-rated movie I attended in a thearte in almost 8 years, I wonder how did Nick and K-C get away with some of the potty jokes. They must've been borderline on PG. There are a good amount of them in the movie, especially during the newborn song number in which involves a shower of peeing, creating a rainbow. Now that's something that Disney will NEVER touch. Dil also uses his fire hose as well. And Tommy's buttocks are exposed.The botton line kids, parents, those in between, and diehard Rugrats fans like me will love this film. Animation knacks may get a kick out of it also.But those that don't like cute cartoons and those older kids may wanna stay out of this. Of course it's up to you.Although the animation is NOT A Bug's Life level, it is 1,000 times better than the T.V. show. And it doesn't play like an episode either as many mislead souls have said before the movie even came out. The action is mostly non-stop. Certainly on a faster pace than any episode. Nickelodeon and Klasky-Cuspo has made one exciting film. This film will really give Babe A Pig in the City and A Bug's Life a real run for their money. Bring on the Sequel!!!

The Rugrats Movie is when Tommy's new sibling is finally born. The Rugrats are very excited about Tommy's new sister, but when the baby is finally born, it's a boy. Baby Dil practically does nothing, but cry, scream, and poop. Tommy thinks he can take him back to the hospital in exchange for a new baby brother, but soon they all get lost in the woods. This is their first time in actual danger, not just their imaginations.This is certainly not the best story for a movie, but it is okay. Baby Dil, however is very annoying. More-so in the later episodes of the show than this movie, because he constantly interrupts their adventures and makes every episode about baby-sitting Dil.While The Rugrats Movie is a decent film, it has flaws.- It's starts the downfall of a once great cartoon show.- Like in Pokémon The First Movie this film tries a little bit too hard to be darker and more dramatic than the TV show it's based on.- There are WAY too many jokes about poop, pee and other such gross things. I'm fine with crude humor when it's in small doses (like on Rocko's Modern Life), or when it's actually made funny (like on The Ren & Stimpy Show). But this movie (and the later episodes of the show) just over-do it.There are good things too though.- I loved the opening sequence of the film.- The animation is great, and perfect for the big screen.- The voice acting is top-notch.- Some parts were really funny. Like when they spoofed Indiana Jones.Overall this is a decent and mildly entertaining film. But it's certainly not one of the greatest animated movies ever. There are better movies of animated TV shows (The Simpsons Movie; The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie; Batman Mask of the Phantasm), but there are also worse ones (Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Film for Theaters; Pokémon The First Movie). Funny, nicely animated, good voice acting, but a little bit too much potty jokes, and it added a horrible character to a great TV show.Rating 6/10 Decent "},{"Title":"A solid film that will please kid fans of the series but offers little for the adult audience that comes with a cinema release","Date":"22 December 2006","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Tommy and his friends are excited and looking forward to the arrival of his new baby sister. However when young Dil arrives he turns out to be a boy as well as not being as much fun as had been expected. With Dill taking all his parent's attention away from Tommy, the other babies find themselves all marginalised by this screaming and pooping creature. Trying to return Dil to the hospital turns into a much bigger adventure than they planned when they wind out lost deep in the woods.Some cartoons are aimed at kids but have plenty for adults to enjoy; some cartoons are so completely for kids that adults struggle to get anything from them. The Rugrats Movie falls somewhere in the middle, being engaging enough for adults without really having that much specifically for them. Of course for kids the simple plot will provide enough adventure to hold the attention while the baby jokes come fast enough to amuse. Adults will not be turned off by the film because it is professional enough to distract, but the adult references are few and far between and certainly not as clever as the Pixar films that adults will be used to.The voice cast deliver the characters from the TV show well enough and will please fans by delivering more of the same but just over a longer running time. Guest turns from Curry, Goldberg, Spade, Clinton, Cho and Rhymes don't add a great deal but in their defence I suppose it was easy work for money. Overall then a professional and enjoyable film for child fans of the series which fills the running time well. However there isn't much for adults other than the promise that at least it won't grate the way some kids films do.

My only major problem with this film is that it is way too loud, it moves around constantly and never really takes time to simply ease down and develop its characters with dialogue, I understand the film is constantly moving as it is aimed at kids, but even children can enjoy a quite moment every now and again. The voice cast is of course fantastic, all the regulars from the series returning to voice their now iconic roles, it also contains some adorable musical numbers that may not be Disney standards but are still plenty of fun.

Seriously. At one point, Drew Pickles puts his brother Stu Pickles in a choke-hold at one point or another in the movie, blaming him for losing his daughter Angelica. There's definitely not that much humor to be have here in this movie. If you watch the cartoon, you'll know what I mean and that is definitely a turn off point for some and why The Rugrats Movie as a whole, received a polarizing response by critics.There are definitely some parts of the movie that drag on and on. The part where the babies get lost and stuck in the forest and wonder around aimlessly in hopes of getting back home, drag on WAY too long and Dil's overall presence in the movie is more irritating than it is pleasing to the typical viewer.Then again if you are someone who isn't a fan of Rugrats, you shouldn't even be watching this in the first place.I give the movie credit for taking a different direction and doing something it's not but, in 20/20 hindsight, it's not all perfect. The songs that the cast of the characters sing throughout the course of the movie are hit and miss. The best one was probably Angelica's take on Blondie's One Way Or Another hit song from the 80's.In all, I only recommend checking this movie out if you are a part of the Rugrats fan base.

The story is that a new member of the Pickles family was recently born called Dil and Tommy and his friends do not like him and decided to somehow send him back to the hospital by going out on a wild crazy adventure. Problem is that on the way to their journey, they get lost and are faced with a very difficult situation and want to return home but they are unsure how. Like I've said, the film was a let-down. The plot was very cheesy and the film was not really about the Rugrats but more about Tommy and his new 'annoying' brother. I was seven at the time when I watched this but even then you can instantly tell just how poor this film is and the Rugrats movie is nothing like we see in the Rugrats TV series prior to this film. Sure the film has some good parts but mostly it was pretty ordinary and dull which is a shame considering how successful its TV show is and this movie basically put a massive dent on its show. Fortunately, the following Rugrats films is somewhat better but even those films did not even live up to expectations. So if you asked me Is it necessary and worth watching? I will say NO! Like I've said, there are some parts that are good but overall the film is average or below. The sequels in my view are much better than this film. Ever since this film was made, the Rugrats as a whole has gone downhill and eventually everything was ended in 04.

Possibly the best scenes in the whole movie are when the idiotic news reporter (I read on IMDb that he's played Tim Curry)getting their names wrong, the Indiana Jones parody at the beginning, (though I think the Godfather parody was great and less obvious), Angelica singing a parody of One Way or Another.There are several references to bathroom jokes and a few sexual innuendos.

It was about Tommy's little brother being born and he, Dil, Chukie,the twins, Angelica and the family dog Spike (Kimi and Harold was not introduced yet,Susie made a cameo and Timmy did not appear at all) getting lost in their fathers invention, the Reptar wagon (Reptar is their Godzilla) and become lost in the wilderness, avoiding countless numbers of near-death situations ( in contrast to the show's warm and secure feel as its usually set in a living room) while donging a group of runway circus monkeys and a sinister wolf. The parents learn quickly of their disappearance (which is rare) and begin a state wide search with the press on their tails, with a climactic chase sequence with the babies trying to find their way to the rangers station only to be halted by a wolf and Spike sacrificing himself to save them.In my opinion it was a great film, but at times felt overworked (countless numbers of guest stars,Dil's birth sequence and a strange twist by adding a much darker and serious tone) but i viewed it as a great thing, (that was probably the first time fans saw the babies dodging freeway cars and savage animals). For those unfamiliar to the show, it would be average to a mere annoyance, especially being introduced to Angelica.The sound quality is wonderful, a huge orchestra score by The London Metropolitan fitting the more serious tone compared to the simple xylophone in the show.

One of the Last Classic Things from the 90s!","Date":"15 July 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The Rugrats television series is almost twenty years old, which is surprising because when one watches the episodes of the TV series the color and overall look of the show looks like a 2000 television series. Enough with that, lets discuss the film. Its what every TV show movie adaptation is. Just an extended episode of the series. Though the sequel is something that is a step in the right direction to be different from the series. With this though, it's fitting to be a full length movie because to chop this down to a thirty minute film would be impossible. Though, this is a favorable TV show adaptation in many ways.The plot is basic, but may be complex to a kid age five or six who this is targeted for. Parents may need to explain somethings about babies after the hospital scene. Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, and Lil are our protagonists in this ride and Tommy's mother Didi is having a baby. When welcoming what was thought to be a baby girl, is now a baby boy. They go with the name Dillon Prescott Pickles and now Tommy has a baby brother.Instead of being a nice companion he becomes a big nightmare for the whole Pickles family because Dil will not stop crying. Both parents Didi and Stu are too focused on Dil to pay attention to Tommy which is how every family gets when a new child is born. Phil, Lil, and Chuckie get tired of the crying and put Dil in the new Reptarmobile which Tommy's dad made in an effort to take him back to the hospital because he's broked. Tommy does the adult thing of trying to resist, but after some odd results, the four wind up lost in the forest with no one to help them.The movie gets heartbreaking in a few sequences and tends to squeeze a tear out of audiences. Some of the humor and references will possibly be way over young kids' heads which is basically how every kids' movie can be sometimes. Watching this for the first time in about eight years I pointed out a lot more and understood more and more of it. The question remains me for me which children's film do I like more; The Rugrats Movie or Hey Arnold The Movie? I think Hey Arnold's film made a bit more sense than this, but still both are fine pieces of film.This was too Nickelodeon's film film to win a Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award which I think is pretty lame. I don't think the company's film deserved to win the company's award. Thats like me patting myself on the back and giving me $100,000 for my review and giving it a best award. But I guess on a certain level it makes the smallest amount of sense. Either way though, this film deserves it and is still widely enjoyed by audiences today.Starring Elizabeth Daily, Christine Cavanaugh, Kath Soucie, Cheryl Chase, Cree Summer, Tara Strong, and Charlie Adler. Directed Igor Kovalyov and Norton Virgien.

Tommy was about to pour the baby food to Dil, monkey running away, and there it goes, the reflection by the water show Tommy's reaction (sadness) that part make me have even more tears.

Yeah I was expecting spoofs like in the cartoon. Spoofs include, FLY AWAY HOME, 2001, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, RODAN, GODZILLA, THE FUGITIVE, and THE WIZARD OF OZ. The voice talent is great. E.G.

There's Tommy, the heroic one. Chuckie the scardie one, Phil the sarcastic one and his twin Lil, the talkative one. But in reality, the babies are at a baby shower. Anybody who saw the family tree prequel episodes knows that Didi is pregnant. Angelica tells Tommy that once the baby comes, Tommy will be forgotten. Though quite doubtful, he disagrees. Down in the basement, Stu works on his latest invention while Drew taunts him. Stu's latest masterpiece The Reptar Wagon. It's like an ordinary child's wagon only it's shaped like Reptar. Well before long, it's time for Didi to be rushed to the hospital and Tommy's new baby brother, Dylan Prescot Pickles, is born. He immediately beings slobbering, hitting Tommy with his rattle and wailing all night. Didi and Stu begin focusing all their attention onto Dil so Tommy feels left out. Stu gives Tommy his old watch and tells him he has responsibility now.        Then one day, Phil, Lil and Chuckie load Dil in the Reptar wagon and decide to take him back to the hostical. Tommy tries to stop them and before they realize what's happening, they're rolling down the freeway in the Reptar Wagon. They take a detour into the forest. They were lost with absolutely no clue where they were and worse of all they had to change Dil's diapey.         Angelica takes off after them because Dil had snatched her Cynthia doll before they pulled out. The parents soon find their kids gone and immediately go searching for them. Back in the woods, the kids run afoul of some circus monkeys that escaped from a wrecked circus train. They were going in the direction Tommy's watch, or sponsetility was pointing. They were actually trying to find The Lizard to wish to get home; Stu took to the skies in one of his inventions to find the kids while Howard, Betty, Chas, Drew, Charlotte and Didi went with some park rangers. Before long, Angelica catches up with the babies; Tommy accepts Dil and learns to love him; the kids meet up with their parents! Now with Dil included in their games, the kids' lives got better rather than going back to normal.        A pretty good movie. It was cute. It was also a good idea! It's sequel Rugrats in Paris wasn't as good. Because it's a sequel. We've already seen Rugrats in the theaters so that isn't much of a novelty anymore. But what was good about Rugrats in Paris is that Chuckie's dad, Chas, get's married to a fabulous woman Kira Watanabe. And she had a kid, Kimi, who's brave like Tommy. Only thing was, in that movie, Angelica was a bigger brat than in this one. Sheesh! Where's a whipping rod when you need one? Anyhoo, The first one is always the best. I hear there will be a third Rugrats movie. It's where they visit the Wild Thornberrys, I think. But in conclusion, I recommend The Rugrats Movie!

Personally, I can recall watching some episodes of the show when I was around ten years old (the show had been running for a few years by then), and never exactly got hooked, but I think I found it mildly amusing at the time. It has been a long time since then, but I recently watched The Rugrats Movie. Knowing it was more for kids, I wasn't expecting to like it a lot, but thought I might still get SOMETHING out of it, which didn't happen.Tommy's life changes when he gets a new baby brother named Dil. After the birth of his new sibling, Tommy finds that he isn't getting very much attention anymore, has more responsibility, and Dil seems to be spoiling his fun. Stu has recently invented a small vehicle called the Reptar Wagon. The Rugrats gang believe that Dil should be taken back to the hospital, so they manage to sneak out of the house and set out on a trip in the Reptar Wagon, taking Dil with them. However, while on the trip, the toddlers don't make it to their destination. Instead, they find themselves lost in the forest with Tommy's newborn brother, where danger awaits them! Since I didn't watch the TV show a lot during my childhood, I barely became familiar with the characters, and when I watched this movie, I couldn't remember any of their names. Consequently, around the beginning, I found the movie a tad hard to follow. (Anyone else who is not that familiar with the show but is planning to watch this movie, I feel I should warn you about that.) In addition to that, I found the story very boring, and a couple gags early on in film may have made me smile or snicker, but for the rest of it, I didn't find any of the gags the least bit amusing. I may have even found some of the excretion gags somewhat annoying. I'm not even sure if my 4/10 rating is enough to tell you how much I disliked this movie. However, I'm sure I would have thought differently of The Rugrats Movie many years ago.Now, obviously not EVERYONE whose childhood has passed them by would think the same of this movie as I did. I suppose you could find SOME fun in it. However, it's certainly not for just anyone who likes animated family movies. While it may not be strictly for kids, it definitely has more for them than it does for anybody else. Regardless of your age, it also might help if you're a big fan of the TV show, which means you're familiar with the main characters and their traits. However, it appears that even some fans of the show have been disappointed by this movie, so even being a fan doesn't guarantee that you would like it, though it's probably worth a try. I wouldn't expect this movie to be a family masterpiece, but I'm sure many kids would like it, and probably certain people in other age groups as well, even though it didn't do anything for me.

I was thinking to myself HELP ME, PLEASE.The movie is based on the Nickelodeon television series called The Rugrats, aimed at very small children. The program, which I have viewed many unfortunate times, isn't my favorite, to say the least. What it does is take a pile of elements that regard pre-schoolers and younger children, presents them on the screen and expects people to care about a bunch of one-year-olds doing baby things. For example, I once saw an episode where the Rugrats had to find their pacifier.  Another where they experience potty training for the very first time. Are you starting to see where I'm coming from. No one cares about what's it happening to the profoundly annoying characters; the Rugrats.The movie, which certainly has the same quality as a fifteen minute television program, not surprisingly details the lives of five babies, Tommy, Phil, Angelica, Chuckie, Will and a brand new addition to the family, Dill. They live in a small standardized town with standardized parents and a standardized dog.One day, under the supervision of their sleeping grandfather, they decide to go on an adventure in the wilderness, which causes a bunch of boring and literally agonizing commotion that lasts  and lasts and lasts&#133;for over 80 minutes.As bad as the story, characters and interest  were in this movie, the musicals were ten times as bad. They spoofed the light rock song One Way or Another, funk and rap melodies. The new born babies at a nursery sing, the Rugrats sing, monkeys sing, all in an array tormenting sequences that, literally,  forced me to walk out and take a long visit to the bathroom.I want to end my review by telling you that The Rugrats Movie is a very bad movie. Not that I have anything personal against the Rugrats themselves, but I know something depressing when I see it. I walked in to the theater with a frown on my face. I walked out in a madder of joy. Not because I enjoyed the movie, but because it was finally over with.

I mean, have you ever seen 1-2 year olds that can speak? Or that could remember any episode of Indiana Jones? Anyone who could drive a Godzilla (Raptar)-Vehicle? How does it come the parents aren't already being sued when they lost their children? And last but not least One baby that wouldn't starve when left in the forest alone?!?

It's a perfect movie to watch with the kids that both of us like. So of course seeing the current RUGRATS MOVIE was a no-brainer.No the movie is a no-brainer.This film's 85 minute length feels like forever. They've taken the funny dialogue of the babies and changed them into a slew of poo and pee jokes.SAMPLE SCENE A group of babies at a hospital urinate into the air, which goes through light which creates a rainbow.Now do you really want your children to see this movie?It's not a total waste. A handful of jokes work and having David Spade voice a Park Ranger are major pluses. But they still can't help this movie which joins LOST IN SPACE and THE AVENGERS of good TV shows gone bad at the multiplex.

Remember Ren and Stimpy came out at the same time -- all my friends were really into R&S but I was the lone hold-out for the Rugrats.Where are Ren and Stimpy now?The animation was truly amazing.  There was incredible depth and color in every scene.The story is a little weak but engaging nonetheless.Some of the animation reminded me of the original Snow White from the Disney Studios.There was lots of music with catchy little songs and lyrics -- but it could hardly be called a musical.Who needs to be a kid to enjoy a really good kids movie?

Only costs a dollar for the kids and the adults are free. Thank GOD! Because I would have hated to spend any more money on this show. This movie, although rated G was NOT what I wanted my children (or the children of my friend who we went with.) to see. We are used to watching TV, but shows that are somewhat educational. This movie used the word stupid and hate (JUST the words I want my 3 and 4 year old s to use!)My daughter (3 yrs old) was scared of the wolf in the forest and the monkeys are mean, and the little girl in with the blond hair is just plain mean too. The movie was really a PG if you ask me. I thought the movie was worthless... although I giggled a few times(at the little cartoon kids vocabulary , but I started to fall asleep in the middle and wished I could but I had to cuddle w/ my daughter because she was frightened...(I didn't mind the cuddling.) If you don't mind rude kids and scary scenes then fine, but my vote is no.....We don't like sponge bob either, that was the other movie showing today. I really don't see how all these parents liked this movie for their children. My take of it is, kids learn to be smart mouthed and sarcastic soon enough, why push it on them at 3 and 4.

They're one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. People don't even bother watching nickolodeon period. Nickolodeon used to be OK but they banned all the cool cartoons. And teen nick is as bad as nickolodeon it's self. Rugrats should finally die off. My two year old brother hates the rugrats. All the rugrats is, is a bunch of little kids exploring with there parents and they imagine stuff that isn't real. Come on Nickolodeon this is sad man. Well yeah words can not describe how bad this film is. But don't go experimenting and see how bad this film really is I barely made it through the film. And I used to be a nick fan but ever since they banned Ren & Stimpy I've hated Nickolodeon ever since. "}]
