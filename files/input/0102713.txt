It is filled with emotion, humor, adventure, and pathos. Nick Nolte is the heart of the film. He is a broken man, covering up for the past, trying to please his family, but unable to open up and absolve himself of the dysfunction of his past life. He travels to New York to try to help his sister by uncovering what he has been hiding, with the help of a psychiatrist (Barbra Streisand). He is enchanted with her, and is therefore able to open up and reveal the secrets deep within his heart. The emotions that Nick is able to impart to his audience is a joy to see. I learn more about him every time I view this movie. He is a versatile actor and is truly underrated. He DEFINITELY deserved the Oscar for best actor for this difficult role. Barbra Streisand was fantastic as the psychiatrist who had her own secrets, and her son Jason was terrific as the rebellious son who wanted to please his father, but who needed to find himself by taking on the challenge of playing football. I never tire of this movie, and each time I view it, I get more out of it. The Prince of Tides has everything I want in a movie, and if I were to rate it, I would give it 4 stars.

Its rhythm, cinematography and casting is perfect and the story never fails to deliver.Tom Wingo, played by Nolte in an all-time best for him, has to go to New York to help his twin sister, Savannah Wingo, played by Melinda Dillon who has attempted suicide for the umpteenth time. Tom is aware there are ghosts in the family but wants to keep them submerged. However with the love for his sister and the encouragement of her psychiatrist, Lowenstein, played by Streisand, the truth begins to unfold along with a love between Lowenstein and Tom who are both in unhappy marriages.There are no easy solutions here to the many issues that are raised, suffice is to say that Streisand, who also directs, keeps a gentle hand in and does not wham home any major emotional points. George Carlin is deft in a minor role, as is Blythe Danner as Tom's wife. The film never fails to pack a punch for me.9 out of 10. Kudos to all, not a false note. "},{"Title":"Sincere, generally well-crafted story about the far-reaching effects of childhood trauma, lovingly directed by Streisand and grounded by Nick Nolte's profoundly moving performance.","Date":"7 June 2001","Score":"22 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Throughout the 80s and 90s, Barbra Streisand has grown in stature (albeit sporadically) as a formidable producer and director of social drama for both films and TV.  The apex of her behind-the-camera career came with The Prince of Tides, a poignant study of a man coping with the long-term effects of childhood trauma.  Streisand nurtures this pet project from start to finish (co-adapted by Pat Conroy from his epic novel), finding a precise heartbeat for the profoundly sentient piece.  Despite a rather protracted love story and one too many climaxes, Streisand, who also co-stars, never loses sight of the novel's primary intent.Streisand graciously hands the spotlight over to actor Nick Nolte, who gives the most sensitive, emotionally complex performance of his varied career.  Tom Wingo is a walking shell of a man who quells his pain with a drink, an easy smile, a cleverly foul remark, and a bitter, uncontrollable outpouring of anger.  A one-time Southern-bred football coach-turned-teacher, he has grown increasingly irresponsible and disconnected over the years.  With a troubled marriage hovering over him, he conveniently heads off to New York City at the urging of sister Savannah's psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein, following his twin's most recent wrist-slashing attempt.  His purpose is to fill in the missing details of her tormented past (she has blotted out all childhood memories) in order to help steer the psychiatrist in her recovery process.  Eventually, Tom, who lacks faith in psychiatry, finds himself facing his own demons as these initial discussions about Savannah take a suddenly dramatic and romantic turn.In addition to Nolte's Oscar-nominated showcase, much of the film's strength lies in the highly concentrated flashback sequences as Tom recalls his turbulent family life.  Kate Nelligan (also Oscar-nominated) is simply extraordinary as Lila, Tom's brittle, often callous mother, who quite understandably vows to remarry into money after surviving a horrific first marriage to Tom's violent, alcoholic, dirt-poor father (played by an absolutely terrifying Brad Sullivan).  Nelligan grabs this role literally by the throat and allows her character no apologies for her flawed, self-serving logic, despite the effects it would have on her children, as her wealthy second husband starts exhibiting the same abusive traits as the first.  Kudos must also go to the three strong young actors who play the Wingo siblings as children for reenacting the more horrific elements of this story. Some of the other present-day roles, however, are hit-and-miss in their effectiveness.  Blythe Danner has some strained though affecting moments as Tom's neglected wife.  Sadly, the vital role of Savannah is nearly excised from the film.  What with the talented Melinda Dillon egregiously reduced to such an insignificant extra, one can only rue the dramatic potential untapped here.  As Savannah's neighbor and trusted friend, George Carlin seems to be around merely to show off New York gay chic -- providing mild amusement, a bit of pathos, and little else.  On a brighter note, Jason Gould (Barbra's real-life son) acquits himself surprisingly well in the difficult role of Lowenstein's antagonistic son who slowly bonds with Tom's absentee father figure -- showing for once that nepotism isn't necessarily blind or reckless.  Dutch actor Jeroen Krabb√© gets brief but noticeable exposure as Herbert Woodruff, Lowenstein's charming, smug-elegant husband, a renown concert violinist who demonstrates more affection for his Stradivarius than either his wife or child.  There is one telling dinner scene at his opulent Manhattan high-rise in which the out-classed Wingo gets to put Woodruff in his place.     As for Streisand herself, many will invariably take her to task for casting herself in the fundamental role of Susan Lowenstein.  A star of such magnitude always faces the daunting task of presenting a fully- realized character, and Streisand is only marginally successful here.  Although there is undeniable sexual chemistry between her and Nolte, it's hard to overlook her somewhat glossy approach to the role and the unethical intentions of her character.  One can only imagine the ramifications of such a harmful act had her suicidal patient ever uncovered the illicit affair between her brother and psychiatrist.Director Streisand, however, must be applauded for her explicit attention to exterior details.  A visually resplendent picture, great care was taken to get the right look and feel.  Notice particularly the lovely allegorical scenes with the children at the beginning and end.  And with Streisand's exceptional musicianship, it is hardly surprising that James Newton Howard's lush score is one of the most beautifully designed ever (in fact, I borrowed it for my own commitment ceremony in 1996).  It floods the film with an unexpressible tenderness.  Nick Nolte's bookend narration is perfect as well -- warm, wise, poetic and reflective.And so, despite the flaws The Prince of Tides may have, Streisand certainly shows that her heart was in the right place.

Firstly, it's easy to detect the Streisand haters among these critics....your hatred is truly sophomoric, and doesn't serve in your recounting an objective critique of the film.As for this film itself, I think that Nick Nolte was absolutely the best element in it, as well as Kate Nelligan. I had never been a Nick Nolte fan, and was very surprised by his layered characterization. He did more with just a certain look, no words, than most actors can hope to accomplish reciting non-stop for two hours straight. In the simple shot of his looking at his daughter blow out her birthday candles and smiling when she's done, right after we are treated with a flashback of his horrid past, was enough to make me break. You could see him hiding some long-held, buried pain behind his genuine smile and love for his daughter. It was, for me, a very subtle, yet powerfully moving moment.I think Streisand did a fine job directing this film, and was definitely robbed of a best director nomination. Several of the academy members who presented Oscars that evening, including Billy Crystal, Liza Minnelli, Shirley MacLaine, and Jessica Tandy (who REALLY made a point in a beautifully sarcastic delivery to mention how ridiculous it was that the film was nominated, but not the director. This almost NEVER happens, and it certainly happened that evening because there are so many academy members who despise Streisand.) Minnelli and MacLaine made a point of saying, before they read nominations for the particular award they were giving, that they would love to be directed by Streisand some day....more digs at the Academy. ANYWAY, beyond the snub, I thought the film overall was very poignant.Where it falls short, however, are in the following areas. First, Streisand and/or the screenwriter (LaGraveness) shouldn't have focused really any time developing a love story between Streisand and Nolte. This was completely unnecessary. For this reason alone, I might not have even voted the film as one of the best of the year....I don't remember what else came out that year. My contention is that, if you're going to honor a film with the Oscar, you should also honor the director, since this film had Streisand's vision all over it. In fact, LaGraveness I believe was also a bit disgruntled with the many rewrites that Streisand made of his screenplay. More time should have been devoted to the horrific background story of Nolte's family, and of his sister. I understand that her character was actually schizophrenic for many years, probably triggered by her rape at 13, but that was not portrayed at all in the movie. Also, I thought Jason Gould did a fine job in his little part. However, I think it was disingenuous to even include that whole storyline in the movie. He was introduced in a slice of voice-over offered by Streisand's character when she talks to Nolte during a transitional scene when she invites Nick Nolte inside her apartment after he walks her home from Eddie's (George Carlin) party. She asks why don't you come inside. I'd like you to meet my son. I know the plausibility we're supposed to accept is that, her son is a bit difficult and he's in football, and Nolte's character is a football coach who might be able to coach him privately....but I just didn't buy this whole plot line. It was an opportunity for Streisand to give her son a part in her film...that's it. He did all right in the part....I just didn't think this element was necessary. More showcasing for Streisand.What else....the love story. I know that Tom Wingo (Nolte) is not her patient, so, romance between a doctor and his/her patient isn't an issue. And, it is plausible that she is pained as well, since her husband is having an affair, we later learn, with another woman. However, it would have been far more realistic and plausible if no romance came up, and no opening up on Streisand's part occurred at all. Or perhaps we might have been offered only a glimpse of her also troubled life, even though it's shielded behind the veneer of her being a successful psychiatrist. But to have her character let loose in a full-blown romance with Nolte's character was a plot line that took so much time away from what I really wanted to see, which was more of the background of the Wingo family, and particularly more of the sister herself....the raison d'etre of the film itself.Part I Ends. See Part II for the rest of my critique.

Probably because it doesn't just happen during the final-five-minute-scene, but is developed enough to make it believable and not ridiculous.  The soundtrack, by James Newton Howard, is lovely and really fulfills and underlines the whole movie. Technically, the finest work is done by the cinematography, which is warm and wrapping.  The entire cast is good, especially Nick Nolte, who is very believable and delivers a great performance.  Barbra Streisand is great behind the camera but only good in front of it.  Playing the role of a rich, sophisticated, and independent woman she is kind of playing herself. Indeed, she is at her best when she doesn't have to deliver any line. Unarguably, because her charming presence by itself is enough to fill up the entire screen.  She was probably too busy worrying about the way she looked than anything else.  This probably wouldn't have happened if someone else were directing her.  But then again, in that case we probably wouldn't have enjoyed her sweet and profound point of view.

Barbara's version takes away most of the message, avoids the subject and meaning of the novel, and merely sets up pretty stage Sometimes a Great Notion, by Ken Kesey. Superb book that far exceeds his One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest. That one misses the point by having the main character focus on the female lead, a kind of claim the woman ending. Nolte's ending utterance, Lowenstein, Lowenstein, has the same impact. Neither the book nor the movie are about possessing a woman, or about a meaningful affair with someone. If men are going to be defined by their relationship with women it will be as tragic as the woman as property attitude men express.After seeing the movie and reading the novel repeatedly, I chose Hunting Island, SC for a Fall vacation. As you drive across SC there is a fall point, a descent from the uplands of the western half, down to sea level. You smell the salt marshes before you see them. When you begin driving through them you recognize how accurately they were captured in the story. I remember my heart racing as we entered salt marsh county and the movie's setting came alive all around us. If you leave your car and walk the boardwalks through the marsh you come to realize that this is the heart of life on earth.

If you read the novel first, you'll learn, the film is very close to the literally version, perhaps, too close. The story follows Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte) on the way to the hospital where his sister Savannah, (Melinda Dillon) is a patient, having tried to commit suicide. There, Tom is asked by a Psychiatrist‚Äé (Barbra Streisand) to help her fathom the reasons why his sister has twice tried to kill herself. During the private sessions which follow, Tom, reluctantly becomes his sister's painful childhood memories. While this helps the doctor understand her patient's background, it also allows Tom to understand why the doctor too, is so unhappy with her marriage. His tragic memories, as well as those of his sister and their family, delves into the very horror of a Southern family troubles, living in a section of a deep river plantation. Every family has secrets which cause intense pain, but when exposed to a listening audience it is chilling to see them exposed Raw and bared to all. The movie is slow to enlighten the listener, but when the movie exposes all, it's patently horrifying and tragic. The cast members which include Blythe Danner, Jeroen Krabb√©, Jason Gould and the late George Carlin, make this story all the more real. Easily recommended, but only to the thick skinned. **** "},{"Title":"One word describes this movie - PERFECT!!!!","Date":"30 May 2000","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  WARNING!

Tom sees the relationship as redemptive for him and ironically he sees it as part of healing his broken marriage.  Some people say that it does not cross ethical boundaries because, technically speaking, Tom is not the patient.  But that is quibbling, because Tom is in great need of help, and Susan gives it to him.  Also, the stuff about New York vs. the South is very much a part of the book.  As for other things that were Streisand's choices, one thing I can say is that she identified very stongly with the Susan character, and that character really did suffer. Who is to say that Barbra hasn't suffered in her life; it's pretty arrogant to make that kind of cheap shot.  Kate Nelligan is younger than Nick Nolte; that is why she got an Academy Award nomination, because she played the character at different ages so well, no sexism here.  You can't put everything into the movie.  Yes, the dolphin part was very cool, but if people really want to go into this story, they should read the wonderful book.  Haven't people figured out yet that people who live in sumptuous apartments can suffer just as deeply as those who have come close to starving?  It's a powerful story, just please read the book!

Streisand does offer up quality films, and I suspect that The Prince of Tides is her best work to date.  Based on the novel by Pat Conroy, this is the story of a South Carolina football coach who must come to terms with a dark family secret when his sister attempts suicide.  Nick Nolte plays Tom Wingo, a man undergoing marital difficulties (his wife thinks he is cold and distant) who must meet with his sister's New York psychiatrist (that would be Barbra) and tell her about some of the family skeletons that his sister has blocked from her memory.  The Prince of Tides is beautifully filmed.  No doubt, Streisand's attention to detail shows through  loud and clear.  The actors are very good, despite what I felt was a script that tended to be overly dramatic at points.  I read the Conroy novel and of course there is far more detail in that story, as Wingo traces back the whole sordid history of his childhood with an abusive father and a social climbing mother.  The movie, despite limitations, does a fine job of capturing the essence of that story.I am not a Nolte fan but I liked this performance, and would go out on a limb to suggest that it is his best yet (even better than Affliction).  Barbra seems to have resigned herself these days to acting with her legs, as they are a featured performer throughout the film.  Perhaps the most noteworthy performance, and my reason for watching this again, is Kate Neligan as the mother, Lila.  Neligan always seems to 'wow' me with her work, and this Oscar nominated role is no exception.  As the sometimes angry, sometimes glamorous, sometimes eccentric, Southern belle, Neligan is fascinating to watch.  The Prince of Tides is at times an indulgent story, but the kicker is pretty powerful stuff.  Nolte has his machismo challenged in this role as his character must confront something that fills him with anger, confusion and shame.  Sadly the climax comes too soon, before most of the soap opera-like twists can be fully resolved, leading us to believe that this effort is running on too long.The Prince of Tides, despite its faults, is a film well worth watching.

This is not normally the type of movie that I would go in for, but this was a mesmerizing drama. Nick Nolte is just sensational. He is truly one of the finest actors of our generation. His character is a man who has managed to carve out a semi-normal life for himself, through sheer effort and determination. From all outward appearances he has a normal life, but there are horrible past experiences, and demons roiling around inside him. What appears normal, is really something ugly and terrifying under the surface. This makes for an extremely unhappy, even scary, marriage and family life. This is conveyed by Nolte exceptionally well. The pain just flows out of him in the scene in the Doctor's office.The flashback scenes with the family are harrowing and sad. The scene with a very young Nolte, and his mother's second husband is absolutely excruciating.I had more of a problem with the romance between Nolte and Streisand. There seemed to be something missing here. As much as I respected the journey through pain that Nolte's character took, I had to then question his judgement in entering into an affair with the Doctor. It seemed to take away somewhat from the movie. I found I couldn't root for this couple; too much seemed unfair and thoughtless. His actions basically were hurting terribly the people who cared about him the most. After the pain and torment he had lived most of his life with, it was disappointing to me that his thoughts woudn't have gone to the people who had lived their lives with him. This seemed to be out of place to me; any Doctor in her position would have understood very clearly that she was dealing with an emotionally damaged and fragile man. It seemed highly unlikely that her character would have taken a step like this. It was difficult for me to buy the romance. It seemed tacked on just for the sake of including a romance in the movie. But, personally, I couldn't help feeling that it was an incredibly thoughtless and selfish move, and destroyed the feelings of cathartic awakening that the earlier parts of the movie portrayed.All in all, though, an exceptional movie, and tremendous acting performances.

There always seems to be a common thread between all these reviews and that is that the reviewer just didn't have the mental or emotional capacity to understand it and therefore begins making up a bunch of crap as to why the movie was bad. The first review for this category, written by some dork from Auckland, is no exception. For example, in the movie, Streinsand plays a psychiatrist. Obviously, given the theme and subject matter in the movie, singing certainly wouldn't be needed...yet this pathologically skeptical idiot manages to dis Streisand for either not singing? Or having a singing career that comes out in other movies or what? What exactly is the problem here? Bruce Willis is an actor who also plays blues harp. But he didn't play that on his way into outer space to blow apart that rogue asteroid in Armegeddon did he? Whaddaya think, 459? Was he fighting himself over that one? And then stupid goes on to say that the suicidal sister was given very little screen time, yet she instigated the events of the story. Well, let's examine this. In Armegeddon, that poor dumb rogue asteroid ALSO instigated all the events of the story. How much screen time did IT have? Also, it's based on PAT CONROY'S NOVEL, YOU MORON!! Rag on HIM or better yet, write your own goddamn book! For example, re-write Dances With Wolves! And make it ALL ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN! Because, hey, he instigated everything that happened, right? And finally, Miss Upside-Down says Nick Nolte is not given much to work with. Excuse me? He's the entire STORY, you loser! But let me say a few things about the other strap-ons who dissed this movie. Several of them actually read the book and think the book was better. Allow me to disabuse them of that notion. I also read the book and was flat out amazed that Streisand was able to take a rambling, dis-jointed, almost incoherent manuscript and make it a first rate movie. Costner did this with Dances With Wolves (which seems to have been written by a 14 year-old for other 14 year-olds) and Eastwood did it with Bridges of Madison County. I've read only one other Pat Conroy novel, the excellent Beach Music, and I was expecting a masterpiece with Prince of Tides, given the brilliance of the movie but I was wrong. Some of the nonsense in the book was such that it's like someone else wrote it. For example, in the book, Calenwald was some GUY, some crazy homeless Rasputin type character that Miss Lila winds up having an affair with or some such idiocy. Give me a break! However, one negative reviewer of the book did mention one thing that unfortunately WAS correct. Barbra Streisand, as great a job of acting as she did in this movie, was not the correct casting choice for Susan Lowenstein. But that's only because I pictured Susan Lowenstein as being brunette. I pictured more of a Karla Bonoff type but the only actress I could think of for this role was Debra Winger. And now follows a second review.Right at the very beginning of the movie, Nick Nolte, in a voice-over as Tom Wingo, supposes that his father Henry Wingo might have been a pretty good father if he hadn't been such a violent man...Ya Think???It only gets worse, dysfunctional family-wise. As much an a s s hole as Henry Wingo was, the mother Lila seems to have morphed from a reasonably decent person into someone who's only values were having money and caring only about appearances. I say she SEEMS to have morphed from A to B, but in fact, she was ALWAYS B. Her behavior should have at the very least caused social services to take her children away from her and preferably landed her in prison. Her greedy, grasping rapacious velociraptor-like appeal managed to get her oldest son murdered by a government that eats its young, (much like today's monkey government, starring George of the Jungle, and his CEO of Hallitosis vice president, giving new meaning to THAT term), her daughter on her third suicide attempt and Tom Wingo himself emotionally crippled without really understanding the reason why. Tom comes to New York to offer insights into his sister's behavior to the psychiatrist, played by Barbra Streisand, who does a decent job although she would not have been my choice for the role. A minor subplot involves the psychiatrists husband, a concert violinist, who develops a hatred of Tom Wingo for coaching his son in the art of football. Probably he felt slighted for not having the sack to do it himself and therefore preferred his son to be a dainty, dolce affetuoso cake boy such as himself.

And to put most of the action in New York city when so much happens in the south was pitiful. Sorry.

I had just broken up with a woman I loved. To try to suppress the searing pain and leaden depression in my soul, I asked another young woman, whom I knew wanted to know me, now that I was free, on a date to watch Prince of Tides. I had no idea that the movie would reflect my own life and my own past failures with loves lost. I realized that like Tom Wingo, I had no capacity to love because my heart was locked behind a shield forged by childhood memories that had haunted me, and left me incomplete without the courage to show anyone the extent of the damage that had been done. Donna, the woman I had loved and lost, tried hard to break past that suit of armor shielding my sensibilities. I tried hard to shed the weighted protective suit, but we both failed. She mistook my shield for fear of commitment, perhaps, or indifference, or even contempt. As I watched the movie, it had a cathartic effect on me. I left the movie house and took my date home. I could see in her eyes disappointment that no connection, or chemistry, had been established, and she could see that my heart burned from a different fire. The next day, I tried, and for the next two or three years, I tried, unsuccessfully, to pick up the pieces of the vase I had broken, and glue them back together. But as I learned, it's a repair that is nearly impossible to accomplish. Once pushed off a shelf and shattered, there is little hope. In consolation, at least, I learned that truth, trained on pain, will show the source of pain, and perhaps even a way to soothe or discard pain. Truth allowed me to relegate bitter emotions where they belonged,and I was able to see her once again as a beautiful, loving, compassionate, exciting woman who stirred emotions and feelings inside of me I didn't know even existed. God how I love, and miss Donna. She had come into my life at a critical time, and taught me the meaning of unconditional love, the quest for adventure, and that the clay of trust, passion and loyalty will create a beautiful sculpture. She had helped me to become a man, with compassion, with insight, with heart. Now, when I hear the heartfelt soliloquy at the end of the Prince, as Wingo is driving across the bridge, I shout a name into the wind as a tribute, but the name isn't Lowenstein, who taught me to live again, the name I shout is Donna.

It sure made me emotional to see him with his daughters playing, laughing and, above all, trying to hide what was happening between him and his wife. I must say that, although the name Barbra Streisand is synonymous of song, love song, I appreciated her as an actress as well. The story is totally credible, the original score is enchanting and every aspect of the photography was excellent.I must say that, although New Yorkers were a bit wilder in 1991 compared to nowadays, I have to say that the New York attitude portrayed in the movie was a bit too much for my taste and they could have toned it down a notch. The cast was a fit for the story (But why George Carlin?) and seeing this movie again after about seven years was rather pleasurable.

Yentl was, of course, redeemed by its lush score and remarkable singing, while The Mirror Has Two Faces, proved unintentionally hilarious for finally and fully exposing just how out-of-control Her ego really has become.  Without the singing (in fact, Streisand intentionally uses an instrumental version of the movie's theme song instead of the soundtrack's vocal one so as not to detract from the film's message) and with her ego still almost in check, Tides falls kind of flat.  While her acting is acceptable, she is almost as miscast in her portrayal of a psychiatrist as is her (real-life and rather slight) son Jason as an aspiring football player.  Much of the problem stems from the fact that Streisand has become so self-conscious about her looks that she must constantly pose in only the most flattering angles (from the left, as everyone - especially Rosie O'Donnell - knows by now) and seems incapable of immersing herself enough in a role to put vanity aside once in a while. (For God's sake, Barbra, have the mole removed and show us the right side of your face, already).  Nolte is actually quite good - his (deservedly) Oscar-nominated performance goes a long way toward redeeming this film.  And while Jeroen Krabbe's role as Streisand's wayward husband is rather thanklessly one-note, most of the supporting players are fine - particularly Blythe Danner and a surprisingly restrained George Carlin.  Nevertheless, one cannot help but wonder just how much better this film - and Streisand - would have been had someone else been allowed to call the shots.

I won't go ahead and tell the story line because everyone who reads these comments already know!  I thought Barbra done a wonderful job at directing this movie. She didn't focus on herself too much and I think we saw more of Nick than we did her. I found the scenes of Tom Wingo's (Nolte) childhood disturbing. Especially when his father would yell at the children and fight with his mother over turning off the television or having something he didn't like for dinner. But the rape scene was the most disturbing of them all. It wasn't graphic or gratuitous, but seeing young Tom screaming and crying over what was happening to him is an image that is burned into my memory.  But I loved how his older brother Luke was very protective over his family and killed the rapists. He was a young man and it is disturbing to see an adolescent man killing three grown men with a shotgun but they deserved it! They broke into someone's home and brutally rape a mother and her two young children!  It was a sigh of relief when Luke blew the men away. Tom loved his brother very much and every time he talked about him he would become sad. I also loved the relationship between Tom and his sister Savannah. He loved her so much and I loved the scenes where he was visiting her in the hospital and reading to her. Very moving.All in all I thought this was an excellent movie and I loved all the performances. And I agree that it's a disappointment that this film didn't win any Oscars.

However, the well-condensed script (written by Conroy himself and Becky Johnson) manages to seamlessly fill in the missing information, and allows all central characters to reach a level of character development that is unusually high for a mainstream Hollywood film. As the film progresses, these characters seem especially real, and they are embodied by an absolutely flawless cast.As anyone who has read the book can attest, the characters of Tom and Lila Wingo would seem to be extremely challenging (if not almost unplayable) roles, both of which are brimming with contradictions and hidden emotions. However, Nick Nolte and Kate Neligan find the perfect balance in their portrayals, which earned them both well-deserved Oscar nominations. Blythe Danner, Jason Gould, and Melinda Dillion all also turn in memorable performances, even though Dillion's Savannah (a lead character in the novel) has precious little screen time due to the film's structure. Barbra also gives an affecting portrayal, however, the director's chair is where she really shines this time.

I love Richie.Ever since my nan brought me &#145;Snooker Legends' I've been taking these really nice pink tablets and things have really got good for me. I've got a new friend Richie who's like this nurse who just watches me and asks me questions and I got a job pushing trolleys at the supermarket.

He gives me my tablets free and has to make sure that I don't drink alcohol with them, but he sometimes sells them to his friends. I don't think he likes being a psychiatric nurse though, because he's always complaining about working with perverts and lunatics, but I know he likes me. I love perverts.This film is about something to do with love, and I think runaway sex-crazed criminals, which is wrong (see my review of &#145;Dead Poets Society' for details of right and wrong), but they dealt with the whole thing very well. I REALLY liked the colours in the film because they were pretty, then a bit scary and then, like a volcano.

Some of his movies I've quite enjoyed; others I think have been disasters. As far as his performances go, I've usually found him good but never quite reaching the heights of greatness. But then there's The Prince Of Tides. Barbra Streisand might have produced, directed and co-starred, but this is Nick Nolte's movie from beginning to end, and his performance is absolutely brilliant. He captures his character's complexities perfectly - his repressed emotions, his unwillingness to face conflict or trouble and eventually his underlying pain in a powerful scene in which the family secret is finally revealed. Streisand as director does a good job of building up to that revelation; Streisand as co-star is just that - a good partner for Nolte who's wise enough and confident enough in herself to let him carry the movie.The story - revolving around Tom Wingo (Nolte) travelling to New York from his beloved southern home to be with his sister who's just attempted suicide - is rather heavy at times. With the sister's suicide attempt and the general dysfunction all the lead characters deal with, it had something of an Ordinary People feel to it, although the conclusion is more hopeful than that film was. The viewer is drawn into the story right away with a surprisingly effective opening narration by Nolte that intrigues us, the movie ends on the perfect note of reconciliation within Tom's family and a powerful closing narration by Nolte. Music doesn't usually make or break a movie for me, but kudos to James Newton Howard, who was responsible for the original music. It was absolutely perfect - it suited the movie superbly and was itself very moving. The movie weakens a little bit after the revelation of the secret, mainly because it turns a bit sappy as Tom and Lowenstein (Streisand) become romantically involved. You could see that coming from the start, but I found it unnecessary - in fact, the whole angle of Tom's growing relationship with Lowenstein (and her son, and her husband) was perhaps an unnecessary diversion. Still, one can't deny the basic power of the story or the strength of the performances. 9/10 "},{"Title":"You've Got to Hand It to Babs","Date":"18 November 2008","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Well-done soap opera with Southern Gothic undertones.Nick Nolte gives a marvelous performance -- the first one to establish him as a serious actor -- as a man in therapy because of a horrible and horrifying event that happened to his family when he was a boy.

He's able to convey the many sides of his character to the viewer effortlessly. A great performance, really.Not so much for Streisand as an actress here! For the first three quarters of the film, she rely more on looks and mannerisms than acting. She DOES look very good and classy in her own movie, but who wouldn't expect more from certainly the most talented woman if not performer of all time? Near the end of the movie, she becomes more credible as an actress, but, overall, she's disappointing in her part.All the others are just perfect. Even the children. With the exception of Jason Gould. But I must single out the wonderful Blythe Danner here! At last a meaty part for her! But that fabulous woman just can be and that's enough. She's beautiful in a natural way, always without a trace of affectation, healthy, radiant...Thanks to Streisand for casting her and directing her so beautifully.What else? See that movie for itself.

To me the book was about the family, the land, and what happens to these children when they grow up on the coast of SC and have two crazy parents. I thought Barbra Streisand spent way to much time and energy on the parts that took place in NY and not enough time in SC. Also, there was a huge part of the book involving Tom's brother that wasn't even in the movie. Also, the kid's accents about drove me crazy. Those kids sounded like they were from Tennessee, not anywhere in South Carolina, especially not the coast. I guess if you had not read the book, it would be a pretty decent movie. However, unlike most novels made into movies this one was not bad because they left out too much, it was bad because the parts that were left out changes the whole tone of the story.

Southern football coach Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte) one day learns that his sister in New York has attempted suicide, forcing him to meet with her psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand, also the director). Through their conversations, we learn that the Wingo family had an abusive father, and how various ugly situations arose from that. Over time, Tom and Susan fall in love.I guess that the part about Tom and Susan developing a relationship was kind of predictable, but Streisand did a good job with the movie. I really liked the part where Tom taught Susan's obnoxious husband Herbert Woodruff (Jeroen Krabbe) a lesson. Good support also comes from George Carlin as neighbor Eddie Detreville. My dad read the novel and said that the few minutes in the movie right after Tom teaches Herbert the lesson weren't done very well; I've never read the novel, so I can neither confirm nor refute that. All in all, quite well done.

Such that, on first seeing this film some years ago, and now again a few days ago, it is indeed a nice surprise to see that she can do things behind the camera with aplomb, with a little help from her friends, and more or less acceptable things before the camera, with a lot of help from Nick Nolte. Almost certainly the best film I have seen him in - or, at least, of the kind that I consider stomacheable. His playing is just right, and helped out by some really good camera-work, the film is pleasantly comfortable viewing with a story-line carried out with much gallantry. Perhaps overly long; I feel sure that a few nicely placed cuts would not have been out of place.Worth seeing with a plate of peanuts, a little red wine, and relax and let the story carry you. Worthwhile viewing which does not require too much cerebral activity, but without falling into the triviality of more recent romanticisms.

Barbara Streisand is certainly no Peter Bogdanovich. Why did I watch this? I thought it might be an interesting film about a man coming to terms with a brutal past. No such luck! This is just another film for the audience of the Young and the Restless. I am actually surprised that Streisand did not throw in any musical numbers! I bet she was fighting with herself over that one. This is the second Streisand film that I have actually seen. The first being the Mirror has Two Faces. Does this woman play the same character in all of the films that she 'acts' in? English teacher, psychiatrist, it all amalgamates into the same person with the Brooklyn accent. Streisand can't act! Stay a weirdo recluse lady! Stop torturing the innocent public! Remember Southpark? That was a prophecy! Where is Robert Smith when you need him?  The major flaws in this film come from the writing. I have not read the book. This film does not encourage me to either! However, this film turns into the Mirror has Two faces. All of the narrative is sucked into the same old tired romantic drama plot devices. It is almost like Streisand takes everything and ultimately turns the material into one of her albums. Corney, sappy, sickly and just downright blurrgghh! Nick Nolte is not given much to work with. I think he needed to be drunker and falling down into gutters. His part was so obvious as the 'dark' and 'troubled man.' He smokes cigarettes so he must be troubled! See! That's character development! I swear, the writers of this film were retarded. Streisand should have been more subtle and just make him walk around with a bottle of whiskey and some razor blades. Nolte also overacts. He is however good at playing troubled men. That is because, well, he is a troubled old bugger himself. If you truly want to see a really good movie about a man struggling with his past. See Nolte in Affliction  by Paul Schrader. This is a truly well written and sad film that features some great performances.    The Prince of Tides falls down because Streisand turns this film into Nolte and her getting it on. That is fine if it is in the original story. But how many scenes does the viewer need of these two looking lovingly into each other eyes?! A whole half hour of the film consists of them doing this. I was wanting to slit my wrists towards the end of the film. The scenes of Nolte getting it on with Streisand. I had to look away! I do not consider either of these people as sex symbols. I think my parents might, but certainly not me! Old people making sweet love by the fire. EWWWW!!!     About 15-20 minutes of the film actually deals with the main characters childhood. Surely the novel held more depth than this.  The actual environment where the kids grew up. The tides, the shrimp fishing. The characters of there parents and its relation to the children's psyches. This is what I was looking forward to! Not watching bloody fights between, Nolte, Streisand and her creepy, 'I like to play my with my own fiddle,' husband! The climatic scene where Nolte explains the escaped prisoners and the rape of his family. This story is told in such an offhand manner, Nolte has a good cry then the characters go, well, o.k, what do we do now? How about a love scene? This is really undramatic and is really annoying. It certainly does not feel like a resolution for the character.     The construction of Nolte as a father figure to Streisand's son. Groan, boy was that corny! An utter cliche! The husband also was the two dimensional villain. He was so obvious that he should have had a mustache, tophat and tied Lowenstein to some train tracks! The son also goes from belligerent teenager to wanting to clean Nolte's toilet with surprising quickness and no real character development. I hated this film because it just seems that no one put any thought into it. The characters all come off as soap opera types. At one stage, Nolte tells a story where his brother Luke went nuts  and blows up a construction site. This could have been the movie! Luke's story sounds far more interesting. Plus, what is bizarre is that the character that plays the suicidal sister is given very little screen time. Yet, she instigates all of the the events in the story! Funny enough, Streisand probably gets the most screen time. For shame! How self indulgent can one mega-star be?  The only reason I'll give this a 1 because where the kids grew up looked like an interesting place. Otherwise this is recommended to those of you who like Hallmark and bad soap opera's. I kept asking, 'when will this self indulgent monstrosity end?'

She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well.The 1991 movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. Granted, she does make herself rather beatific even in her high skirts and flimsy blouses, but such expectations come with Streisand as she basically plays Tom's savior. At the same time, it is probably her most subtle work on screen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay. Melinda Dillon has little to do as Savannah except look traumatized, which she does well. And in a not too subtle display of nepotism, Streisand's son, Jason Gould, sullenly plays the doctor's son, a musician-in-training who is coached on the finer points of football by Tom.The movie is not without flaws. First, there is a critical scene where Tom confesses to Lowenstein (as Tom calls her) what exactly happened in his childhood that none of the Wingos have been willing or able to share with anyone else. Because of Streisand's effective juxtaposition of the long-ago violent crime with the present-day therapy session and Nolte's superb work, this is an especially powerful sequence. It feels climactic in nature given the depth of the catharsis we have been presented at that point, but the problem is that it comes about 45 minutes before the end of the movie. It is around this point that the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein following a tense, pretentious dinner party with Jeroen Krabbe holding court as her psychologically abusive husband, a world renowned violinist out to humiliate Tom. Consequently, we are given a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Luckily the film recovers toward the end before any serious damage is done. Special mention should be made of the beautiful cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt, who perfectly captures the burnished aura of the lowlands of South Carolina, and the symphonic, often swooning score by James Newton-Howard. It's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together.

I have been reading repeatedly in the IMDb reviews that the book is much better than the movie; of this I have no doubt. Then again I have never seen a movie that has been better than the book. Books are infinitely better because we create the characters in our own mind, and basically are directing the visuals of the story ourselves. Because all directors adapting movies from books have to fight this natural disadvantage, they are often accused of 'not capturing the book'. How could they capture what you saw in your own mind? It's a no-win scenario for the director, which is why a film needs to judged as a completely separate piece of work.This film works on many levels, and I completely believe Streisand and Nolte in these roles. It's my OPINION that many people who have torn into Ms. Streisand on IMDb are people who either don't like her personally, or disagree vehemently with her politics. I am no great personal fan of hers, and my belief is that her political voice is way out there. However, this difference of political opinion cannot cloud the fact that she directed a great film, and put in a very credible and believable performance.The only real issue I have is with the character of Lila. She seems very shallow and only seems to be there to make everyone she comes into contact with miserable. One wonders how her new husband could stomach her bitter personality. She doesn't hide it well. That and her makeup job in the older years is awful. But these are minor concerns. Oh, and George Carlin could disappear and no one would notice or care.The true performer here is Nolte. His journey and relationships are real, flawed, believable and heartwarming, all at the same time. The way he hides his pain through humor is something I have seen a great deal of people do. He is a good man, but he is the only one who seems incapable of seeing that. The Lowenstein character does a marvelous job of tearing down the barriers of doubt in Nolte, all the while exposing her own fears, doubts and unhappiness. It is here the two characters bond. Having shared intimate secrets with each other that they never shared with anyone else brings them towards a natural level of trust and love. It happens quickly, but we believe it (unlike in most movies &#150; Titanic's Jack and Rose come to mind). All this tied in with an excellent musical score, this film really works! Overall, The Prince of Tides is a spectacular film. Streisand does her best work here by far. If you have been conditioned by the book, go back and try to watch this film on its own merits. I know this is difficult (an example of this with me is The Firm - a movie I just can't seem to buy into after reading the novel), but if you can do that, you may be pleasantly surprised.

Nick Nolte instead came off as having swallowed a bottle of Adderall, then trying, and failing, to do a comedy routine. I was also unmoved by his emotional scenes. And Barbara Streisand as the unhappy psychiatrist who doesn't realize her own beauty and inadvertently seduces Tom while trying to coax out his emotions? No offense to Babs, she is an excellent actress, but not meant for this role. Furthermore, while I understand the movie couldn't possibly portray every part of the book, the parts it did choose were random and failed to capture the true story. For instance, there was an entire story behind the rape scene that wasn't explained, nor was the part where Lila takes young Tom to the rich guy's house to apologize. Savannah Wingo, the character who half the story is supposed to about, wasn't developed nearly enough.

As a result of their talks aimed at ferreting out Savannah's childhood issues, Tom's own painful past is revealed and the pair fall in love. I don't fault the acting. Nick Nolte is the definite shining star in his role here, especially in light of the horrendous memory his character has repressed. Barbra Streisand is convincing enough as the sophisticated, independent psychiatrist. It just isn't a role that elicits much sympathy or even interest from me. If anything, her entire persona annoyed me. Aren't relationships between psychiatrists and close relatives of their patients considered somewhat unethical? However, I was interested to read that Streisand's real life son, Jason Gould, portrays (quite effectively) her character's teenage son, Bernard.These psychotherapy tales are just not my type of movie. I fail to find painful childhood memories very entertaining and, dramatic as their uncovering was, the pair failed to elicit enough concern from me to take much interest in their fate. Perhaps Tom should have made more of an effort to sort out some of these issues with his admittedly not very responsive wife (Blythe Danner). It's the entire 'My wife just doesn't understand me' story yet again. Of course Tom also has a domineering mother (Kate Nelligan), and Susan both a difficult husband and a rebellious son eager to please the father but needing to find himself via football.

He plays a man from South Carolina, an English teacher and football coach who is the brother of a famous author, Melinda Dillon who has made numerous attempts to kill herself. She's living in New York and seeing the latest in a long line of psychiatrists who in this case is Barbra Streisand. But Streisand is going to try something new. She asks that Nolte come to New York and tell some of the family secrets in a hope that a breakthrough can be achieved. Nolte comes to New York and gets some healing of his own in the process.The two of them do have an affair and it's interesting that both are married, but the liaison seems quite natural and normal, in fact the whole film builds up to it. The high point of the film is Nolte telling of the traumatic event that scarred all their lives to Streisand. He's telling someone he regards as a friend not a medical professional.Director Streisand got fabulous performances out of Actress Streisand and the rest of a well cast feature film. Nolte lost the Best Actor Award to Anthony Hopkins for Silence of the Lambs and the film itself lost Best Picture to Silence of the Lambs. Kate Nelligan who played Nolte's mother lost for Best Supporting Actress to Mercedes Ruehl in The Fisher King. The Prince of Tides got nominated in five other categories, but did not win in any of them. And most egregiously, no nomination for Barbra Streisand for acting or directing.Barbra even got to direct her son Jason Gould who plays her son. Most of his scenes are with Nolte however. Jason has talent genes from both sides of the pool, but the nose is definitely mom's.The Prince of Tides is a great story about love and healing and is a Nineties classic.

Instead of challenging him to a duel as any Southern Gentleman might,Mr Nolte merely holds Mr Crabbe's fiddle out over the balcony in a fit of pique. There is a little of a Hick from the sticks quality about Mr Nolte as he arrives in the Big Apple to see his twin sister who is recovering from a suicide attempt.He appears never to have met gay people before,nor rude cab drivers and is a long way from the New York State of Mind that the city's denizens are so proud of. Then he meets his sister's shrink (Miss B. Streisand)whom he later refers to as a Manhattan Jew.We never actually see the shrink and her patient in the same scene,but gradually Miss Streisand sets her on the long path to recovery (at 150 bucks an hour one would hope not too long) and at the same time persuades a reluctant Mr Nolte to reveal some horrifying secrets from their family's past. I'm fairly sure the A.M.A. has rules about the conduct of medical professionals towards patients and their relatives but does Miss Streisand give a fig?Clearly not as she seduces an obviously confused and vulnerable Mr Nolte.(Although not as confused and vulnerable as Mr Redford had been in The Way We Were). Eventually he is stricken by conscience and returns to his wife and daughters - oh,didn't I mention them?How remiss of me - but,obviously,never gets over Miss Streisand,muttering her name as he drives home every night from work.Get over it Nick - it would never have worked. The Prince of Tides is the sort of movie Taylor and Burton could have made 40 years ago and we would have laughed uproariously at the silliness of it all,but Mr Nolte and Miss Streisand go for serious and ,apart from the soft - focus love scenes,achieve it more often than not.Mr Nolte in particular excels as the jock with well - hidden secrets.He conveys brilliantly the ostensibly bluff and tough Southern male who has spent thirty years in denial. Miss Blythe Danner is equally good in the small and rather thankless part of his wife. Miss Streisand,actor,producer,director,singer,writer and all - round Rennaissance Woman may well have a big ego,but my goodness she's entitled. She was unlikely to have pleased devotees of Mr Conroy's novel but she has made a film that should be judged on its own merits.

Nolte does a fine job, but the 650 pg. novel is condensed down to 2 hours. This causes a lack of the subtlety and forshadowing which make the novel truly great. The focus is all wrong. Instead of focusing on the Wingo family and the telling of it's history, which in turn nurtures both Tom and Savannah back to peace and health, the focus is on the short relationship between Susan and Tom. This is not what the book had in mind at all. Thus key important figures in the novel, Savannah, Luke, Henry, and Lila, are glanced over. With Luke, perhaps the major protagonist of the novel barely being mentioned. Other important figures, like Amos and Tolitha are not mentioned at all. Instead of beautiful well crafted novel, in which nature, family, and the southern way of life are explored, and admired. We are left with a clich√© romantic drama, with only two real characters. I know Pat Conroy received credit as the screen-writer, but I have to believe that this wonderful story was either butchered by Streisand in the director's chair or in the editing room. I really expected great things from this movie after reading the book, but it hits all of the high points with none of resonance of it's source. 3 out of 10 stars.

This movie is like taking the love story of David and Bathsheba and making it the central love story of the bible. There is so much missing. Please do yourself a favor and read the book and skip the movie. The images from the book will haunt you forever and you will judge all great novels against this story hereafter. The images from the movie haunt me only in a disappointing way. Of course, like many have commented - Tom is not the Prince of Tides. His brother Luke is, and that character is only given a few lines. It is cheap and disturbing to see the way the plot of this movie is given away like a whore, when Pat Conroy plays you for chapters, trying to figure out who, if anyone (Savannah, Tom, Lila) is really telling the truth. The disturbing images of Savannah and her madness are really not explored in Depth. There is no mention of her visions of bleeding angels and angry dogs. The only word that Lowenstein mentions from the post-coma diagnosis is Calanwold, and even that is not explored in depth. The only character in the movie that lived up to the book was the father - and he wasn't mean enough. The violent, abusive, drunken man was only hinted at. Nick Nolte does not even come close to a Beaufort lowland accent, I don't even know if it is a southern accent. It is a disappointment.

It looks put upon and completely forced.The story is there, I am sure the book has some resonance, but this movie, while pretty in some ways, was just painful to watch. There are some quality actors in this, making fools of themselves. And nothing is worse than the way the scenes are setup. Fake is the best word I can use for it.Want a REAL good example?

Nolte's brow moves like a metronome for an oompah band, the scenes of Streisand's ass in motion are spectacular in near double-time, and the cathartic pedophile rape flashback renders its true poetry when the adult Tom Wingo winds up heaving in the arms of Lowenstein 25% sooner. All it lacks is Yakety-Sax. A very fast and hard thumbs up. "},{"Title":"Not bad. But not Barbra at her best.","Date":"17 March 2003","Score":"2 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I have been a fan of Barbra for years. Even though I am, I always like to view her movies as I would any other. As a movie. Not a Barbra Streisand movie. So being that the case, this is what I have to say about The Prince Of Tides it is alright. I really do hate to say it, but I just feel that her portrayl of Susan Lowenstein was pretty much lackluster. That is not to say that I do not feel that she didn't have some good scenes in this film, because she certainly did. But I am talking overall here. And overall, I felt that she did not really bring to life, or develop the character that she portrayed here, in this movie. I do feel though, that Nick Nolte DEFINITELY brought depth and dimmension to his character, and brought his character to life for sure.In fact, I even feel that the woman who played his mother, Kate Nelligan and the woman who played his wife, Blythe Danner, did as well. Very much so. Even Barbra's son in the movie,(her son in real life),did an absolutely fine and wonderfully believable job portraying his character. But Barbra's character just didn't come to life for me like the others did. Also, the story itself was just a little too soap opera-ish; with the music being just a wee bit meladramatic at times. Would I say that this is a bad movie? Definitely not. Would I say it's worthwhile to see? Yes, I would. But would I say that it is a perfectly made excellent movie? No. That I wouldn't say. But again, worth seeing.

Barbara Streisand put the emphasis on entirely the wrong aspects of the story. She went into so little detail about the complexity of the Wingo's life growing up, which were the most rich and poignant aspects of the book without question. What Streisand created was a love story, nothing more, and borrowed a couple of characters from a beautifully written book that she loosely based her movie on. Pat Conroy should resent this simplification of his dark, intense novel about abuse, power, coping and, of course, love. He should have found someone to faithfully uphold his vision, rather than turn it simply into a love story with glimpses of Wingo's sordid past.

In fact, to be honest, just read the book. The book is quite possibly the most terrific book I have ever read.Pat Conroy delivered a masterpiece of a novel and there is just no way a movie could possibly touch all the aspects of the book. I will not give anything away, but the first obvious reason the movie cannot accomplish this task is because the book is chock too full of story to fit in a 2 to 3 hour span of movie time.Do yourself a favor and read the book. If you aren't a big reader but are interested in reading something that will get you into reading, DEFINITELY read this. Words can't really describe it.

Everything associated with this utterly awful motion picture is absolutely terrible. Barbara Streisand cannot act her way out of a paperbag and has absolutely no directing talent at all. The story is way too complicated for it's own good and due to the incredibly slow pace and lack of depth to the cliched characters, it is impossible to maintain an interest in this drab motion picture.  And, to make matters worse, there is a pointlessly horrible scene in which a boy gets raped by one of the attackers who invades the family home. A truly slow, boring and terrible movie.

She is not Lowenstein (at least from the description in the book) and thinks she is much prettier that she appears in this movie. Read the book... "}]
