To quibble about the automobiles or the Hardee's cups shows such a lack of perception as to what was attempted here, that it truly boggles the mind.The dissenting voices here clearly prefer the artificial, rose-colored-glasses view of high school as offered by Sixteen Candles or other films of John Hughes. But, for most, and maybe this realization only becomes apparent once one has some significant distance from one's high school experience, for most the high school experience is NOT a star-spangled memory a la Ridgemont High, Dazed and Confused, or even American Graffiti.These formulative years, more often than not, are times of discovery, of embarrassment, of confusion. and of long stretches of boring and mundane matters.Writer/director Skoog captured, with no illusion whatsoever, the awkwardness of this period, with the realism and honesty worthy of of a Ken Loach or Mike Leigh. For most people, life is NOT Ten Things I Hate About You, it is about self-discovery and awareness, and sorting out one's rightful place in the human equation. Skoog's two main characters superbly realized this human comedy.Anna is a beautiful, talented young girl who has not come to grips with either her talent nor her beauty. She is so easily buffeted by the forces surrounding her, be it her bad-girl best friend or the men who are more than willing to introduce her to the awkwardness of sexual initiation, that it is often heartbreaking to watch.The fact of the matter is that bad things happen to good people, and in watching Anna attempt to navigate her way through her voyage of discovery, the film subtly explores its themes with rare honesty.The treatment of sexuality is amongst the film's strongpoints. The peer pressure to conform and the curiosity of the unknown is explored with sensitivity. The bare boobs approach of most teen films is abandoned here for a heartfelt examination of the myriad of forces that are involved in human sexuality...the various dynamics, be they sexual or power, that make the experience a lot more than just a procreative act.These aren't characters, these are living, breathing people with inexplicable, self-destructive urges as well as a completely realistic complacency that often allows them to be drawn into situations that are not in their best interests.This is one of the finest coming-of-age films I have ever seen. If you are a mature, perceptive cinema lover without need for an artificial, romanticized approach to the teen experience, do yourself a favor and check out, Whatever.

A pleasant surprise I caught purely by accident the other night on the Sundance channel.   As a person who was 13 in 1981, this movie struck a chord in me that wasn't just nostalgia.  Most of the characters were memorable and more than just a little familiar to me; Ana, VERY real, I knew half a dozen girls like her, including me.  Her English professor, the spiteful and vindictive Mr. Stanley, who didn't have a pain in the ass teacher like this?  All of the various heads, drunks and sluts that flocked to Friday night keggers and house parties. Even her ever-hopeful, yet terribly sad mother was a brilliant touch.  The script was so well written, in that, while there wasn't much of a real storyline, a few days in the life really, even the secondary characters were anything but one dimensional.I loved the soundtrack as well, not only did it make me want to break out some of my highschool vinyl, it did a great job of enhancing scenes without taking over and drowning out the actors.The best thing about this movie though, no FAKE, sugary Hollywood ending!

It's certainly not getting the attention of the mainstream Hollywood summer blockbusters but it's a lot more powerful and enjoyable.Synopsis The story takes place in a working class new jersey suburb set in 1981 and centers on a young woman, Anna Stockard played by newcomer Liza Weil. Anna, in her senior year of high school, comes from a broken family, hangs out with the party crowd and is uncertain of her future. Although seemingly intelligent and artistic, she lacks focus. It's unclear if Anna will end up like her hard drinking and drugging friends or fulfill her ambition to go to art school in New York City.The film was written and directed by New Jersey native Susan Skoog and unlike other films about the 80's (e.g., Boogie Nights), Whatever provides a very realistic view of this era. The clothing, hair styles, slang, and music all represent the suburban early 80's not the Hollywood version.Although many of the characters are unappealing, the film still manages to capture you. I was both riveted and disturbed by it. Weil carries the film by playing Anna with a stoic integrity - you sense that she is a survivor. Skoog has created a film where you feel as if there was a hidden camera viewing a real teenager's life back in 1981. Skoog and Weil appear to have promising careers ahead of them.If you want to see asteroids, bombs, fireballs and explosions, the 10 plex has a whole bunch of them. If you want to see a movie that is affecting, albeit, slightly disturbing, drive a little further and checkout Whatever .

One girl is awkward looking and shy, but talented with a bright future as an artist.  The other is prettier and popular, but not really destined for much.  Both live their formative years in a backwater New Jersey suburb and their lives are far less polished and sanitized than those portrayed in most teenage coming of age films these days (TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, SHE'S ALL THAT, etc...)  This film is gritty and real and the characters are powerful.  It's hailed as a great 'chick flick because it's focus is these two girls, but it's more than that.I thought they did a great job portraying a realistic world.  Hell, the high school party scene was stolen right out of my life! ;)In any case, the acting is superb.  The two girls, Anna and Brenda are played by Liza Weil (Stir of Echoes, A Cur for Serpents) and Chad Morgan (Co-Ed Call Girl).  They find themselves looking for their own identity in the midst of messed-up family lives and peer pressure.  Anna's the daughter of a single mother who works as a waitress and has affairs with rich married men to help support her kids.  Brenda suffers through years of sexual abuse at the hands of her step-father.  Both find escape and comfort in their pursuit for adulthood -- hopping from one new experience to the next in search of themselves.  Drugs, sex, lawlessness... all of these things become part of their lives, and things which they must overcome in order to survive.

The significance of it's taking place in 1981 was the last hurrah of the Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll era.  AIDS soon followed, and casual sex died.  The sex is a big part of the story, a realistic portrayal of a teenage girl's struggles with her newborn womanhood.The peer pressure to do drugs, smoke, and have crazy meaningless/meaningful sex, all induced by the young idiots around her, happens to most American kids.  Anna's dreams of art school are nearly crushed by the combination of her friends, her lonely, pathetic mother, and the usual teenage self-deprecation.  It's not hard at all to relate to this character.It seems that this movie was too subtle for some viewers.  Perhaps some people don't want to know the female side of stories we've seen the male counterparts of (quite redundantly) through the years.  I welcomed the fresh point-of-view the film possesses. My only true beef would be that it may have been a little too long, but then again, wasn't this writer/director Susan Skoog's first film?A good film with fine direction of realistic performances (with the exception of the nerdy teacher - ugh) and a nice accompanying soundtrack.

They don't know what is good or wrong any more, easily misunderstand and lost. Although, I could be pain in the ass and search for dramatic holes and some cliché in portrait of some of the characters. Some of them are more types then characters &#150; example &#150; Art professor is type of looser in the world of art, and boldly enthusiastically supportive for Anne but hardly expresses any of his goals, his own characteristics.

The best known movie talking about teenage life in the eighties is probably The Breakfast Club, but apparently Susan Skoog was a bit nostalgic to the time that she was a teen herself and therefor situated it in the year that she was 17/18 herself. Whether this movie has been based on her own life, I don't know.When a teenage girl is growing up in a still carefree world of sex and drugs (it's 1981, they don't know AIDS yet), she is looking forward to life as an artist. She is very good in painting and is stimulated to develop her skill further at college by one of her teachers. But there are several things that could jeopardize her future. Not only doesn't she have a great relationship with her divorced mother and her younger brother, she is also influenced by the wrong friends who prefer to party and drink all night long, to have sex and use drugs instead of thinking about school and their futures...Perhaps this is the kind of movie that some parents want to show to their kids as a part of their upbringing. Some might want to use it to show how drugs, booze and sex can bring down your entire future, but personally I'm already past that faze, so I don't care about the 'hidden' message in this movie all that much. But that doesn't mean that I can't watch it for another reason of course. The acting for instance is OK and this movie still gives an idea of how the youth acted in the 1980's (not that much has changed ever since).I wish I could say this was the best coming of age movie ever, but it isn't. I've seen many that were a lot better than this one. However, it certainly isn't a bad movie and to pass a lazy afternoon, this movie is more than good enough. It's perhaps not exceptional but it's worth a watch and that's why I give it a 6.5/10.

The design of her Hardee's cup was relatively new...Hardee's cups in the '80s had like a little orange sunrise on them. About the only good things in this movie was the music and the vague nostalgia it conjured up in me on what it feels like to be young -- you know, when everything that happens to you is a disaster.Not a bad rental, but I wouldn't pay the full price for it -- wait until it's off the new release rack and is available for 99 cents.

On a whim, I went with a friend of mine to opening night in Nashville. There were three others in the theatre. I must say that from the opening gang-rape scene through the incessant ramblings that Susan Skoog might call a storyline and finally to the trivial, inconclusive ending, this movie is classified as unbearable at best. Several of my friends asked me to describe the movie, and I struggled to even recount the exeperience to them a few short hours later. Even now, I cannot remember either the plot or any distinct qualities of the characters. The movie does not, as some people claim, explore the awakening of a high school girl as she chooses between going to art school and basically becoming a human waste--rather it is more of an exploration of the awakening of the movie patrons at the end of the film.The acting was less than desirable--the lines were forced and rough, the actors' motivations were randomly disjointed from the words they were speaking. The writing itself is reminiscent of a first draft of a 9th grade archetypal story. The choice of camera shots was predictable with the one glaring exception of a 45 second close up of a guy's face as he gets a blow job from Anna. (As a male, this DOES NOT add to any movie, I mean who wants to see THAT for 45 seconds).Perhaps the only redeeming quality to the movie is that it marks another cinematic milestone for character actor Frederic Forrest. He got his break as the chef in Apocalypse Now and was made famous as the Nazi surplus store owner in Falling Down (these boots are good...for stomping queers). I must caution you that seeing this movie rivals operating on your own appendix. Don't make the mistake I did. "}]
