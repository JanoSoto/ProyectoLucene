[{"Title":"Ahead Of It's Time...","Date":"27 June 2006","Score":"27 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" Many people have the wrong impression of this movie. Most group it in within the cop/buddy genre and cheesy sci-fi. But Alien Nation is much more than that. In fact, it was way ahead of it's time.I saw this movie in a dimly-lit, run-down Detroit-area theater at the age 14, an afternoon in the fall of 1988. I recall how the atmosphere of the movie matched that of the run-down theater I was sitting in. At 14, and with the title of Alien Nation, a young kid like myself wanted to see weird alien creatures and lots of action. At the time, I was disappointed. This movie is about story, not action or weird aliens. Although I didn't really understand nor enjoy the movie at the time, it always stuck with me for some reason. So, nearly 18 years after seeing it on the silver screen, I re-watched it at home and was amazed by the depth of the story and the grittiness of the background. It was little wonder why I didn't like it at 14, but loved it at 32.This story is really about race and immigration, with the hated race being alien immigrants. It shows how hatred and ignorance over race can transform one's personality, like the lead character played by James Caan.Alien Nation asks questions about ourselves as humans. How would we react if aliens landed on Earth and announced they were escaping a brutal planet full of slavery and have immigrated to Earth? Would we accept them as our own, or would we force them to become outcasts? Would we allow an Affirmative Action scenario in regards to Aliens and Alien rights? Would we offer them high-paying jobs and/or top-notch education, depriving humans of those same jobs and quality education in exchange? To me, Alien Nation is one of the more possible (and perhaps likely) scenarios. Aliens delegated to run-down areas of big cities. Token jobs occasionally handed out because it's forced by the Government to do so. And a general disgust towards Aliens amongst the human population. In that regard, this movie was way ahead of the curve.Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars. Recommended for those over 25, perhaps those with a higher intellect than most. Not recommended for someone looking for a Men In Black type of Alien movie. Not your typical Hollywood blockbuster filled with Aliens, that's for sure.IMDb ROCKS!JD "},{"Title":"Well made Sci-Fi","Date":"19 October 2005","Score":"27 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" Alien Nation is a cross over between Sci-Fi and the 'buddy cop' genre. What separates this from the usual buddy film is that instead of the difference being ethnic/class/gender, it is human (James Caan) and alien (Mandy Patinkin).The clich√©d beginning with the main character's partner being killed is done very well with stylish gunplay and set pieces. Caan really shines in the action scenes and it is great to see him in such a tough guy role. Caan is a great actor and can do more than macho as he shows in the scenes involving his daughter when Caan displays remorse, making the audience feel more sympathetic towards him. Caan aside, the cast is fairly mediocre, full of average actors except Terrence Stamp who puts on a good show as the bad guy.Something I loved about this film is how similar everything is to The Terminator. This is due to the film being produced by Gale Ann Hurd and there being other members of the Terminator crew present. Like Terminator, Alien Nation greatly benefits from the dark, murky feel of the environment, giving it an edge over a lot of Sci-Fi films which suffer from being too 'shiny'.The film does a great job at exploring racism, giving the impression of time repeating itself regarding the Western civilisations treatment of blacks when they were forced in to the country. Caan's conversion from despising the Newcomers to accepting them is admirable and convincing. It is not an overnight change and it is done discretely, very convincing.As with a lot of escapism films, you can not take Alien Nation too seriously so it is best to approach this film with an open mind and desire to be entertained rather than wishing to be introspective. A very well made, enjoyable film.

These Newcomers, which is what we have come to know them as, were genetically-engineered for the specific purpose of slave labor. Soon afterwards, they are put into quarantine. The newcomers have almost all the physical features of human beings except for a few. They have no hair on their heads, the males can become pregnant and they have two hearts instead of one. When released, they are then integrated into our society. They are given names of famous places or important historical figures like San(m) Francisco or Ronald Reagan. This integration into our society however, opens the door for a new kind of racism. Racial slurs like slags are uttered behind their backs. Perhaps for the first time minorities are going to be looked upon from a different perspective. Human beings begin to fear for their jobs as the newcomers start to take over people's employment opportunities. It isn't long before they are being featured advertisements too. Much as Chinatowns have formed in major cities around the world, the newcomers are given their own Slag Town. Even as the newcomers start to become a big part of our society, this also opens the door for extraterrestrial crime. This in turn, introduces us to human cop, Detective Matthew Sykes(James Caan). Sykes, who has a slight distrust towards newcomers, becomes even more hateful of them one night after getting into a shoot-out with two newcomers, which leaves his partner dead and him thirsty for revenge. Matthew then sees his chance for revenge the next day, when he is assigned to be partnered up with Detective Sam Francisco(Mandy Patinkin, who is only recognizable by his voice and a few facial features). Francisco has recently been promoted and in turn has set a milestone for newcomers and the history books as becoming the first humanoid detective. Sykes who refuses to introduce Francisco as Francisco, gives him the nickname George. Sykes is naturally hateful towards Francisco, but as time goes on he soon begins to accept him for who/what he is. As their investigation goes on, it leads them to the center of an extraterrestrial drug ring, headed by a shady newcomer named William Harcourt(Terence Stamp). The drug, known to the newcomers as Jabluka but better off known to us as liquid detergent, is a very potent narcotic. As George says it's more potent than any human drug. He is right about that.The drug, when taken in large quantities, can trigger a change in the newcomers, a change that is best kept secret. This is why George becomes so eager to see the drug destroyed before its presence is known to the human population. Alien Nation is such a unique piece of science-fiction that had the potential to be something really spectacular. It really bugs me that this movie had the chance to be something so amazing, so new, that it instead became a standard buddy flick with some sci-fi stuff thrown in it. James Caan and Mandy Patinkin make a good team and Terence Stamp is good to as the evil Harcourt. I believe that even though this movie is basically failed potential, I have gotten the bizarre social message hidden within it. It contains a message about how amazingly fast the newcomers have become a major part of our society. It amazes me that William Harcourt, although he is the bad guy in this movie, he is also extremely well educated. It's pure genius that he is able to use his high social status amongst the humans as a means of becoming a well known drug dealer. Human drug dealers probably would not need to envy or want to kill Harcourt, since they could find equal business opportunities in both their own communities as well as the newcomer community. The story also tells about the competition of aliens over humans. For millions of years, humans have been the dominant species on Earth. Now with the arrival of the newcomers, humans for the first time ever, are facing competition with a species that becomes more and more advanced every day. This explains largely in part as to why we are becoming more afraid of them, for fear of not only our jobs, but our place as the dominant species of our own planet. It won't be long before the newcomers become involved in human politics and then there may soon enough be a humanoid president. With this in mind, it is possible that not far down the road, that the newcomers could enslave us, as they were back on their own planet. In some ways, the origin of the newcomers and their position in our society, reminds me of the history of African-Americans. Being African-American myself, the story reminds me largely of the civil rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's. African-Americans, as well as any other minority group, have faced about as much discrimination as one could take. The racism that has been associated with the newcomers is almost exactly like what happened when minorities began taking up jobs that whites had been vying for. Do you see what I mean? Alien Nation could have tackled so many social issues dead-on and would be a classic by now. Even with these faults, I enjoyed myself while watching this and I will try not to hold them against the movie. I give Alien Nation an 8/10.

The movie also contains a little humour, some quiet subtle, and is well paced. The only downside is you will want to know what happened next.it also works as a drama due to the nicely scripted family scenes, which are not to sugary. Obligatory bad guys, with wonderfully bad guy plans, and cop to cop jibes, which are not lame.So if you like Sci-fi, drama and cop movies you will love this, the makeup is decent, and the 80's fashion is not overdone, so does not date the movie.Also it has some real stars in it, see the IMDb site for the cast list.

It is an interesting allegory of racial conflict, using a sci-fi premise and a buddy-cop formula.  You have the minority rookie cop assigned to the bigoted partner, who are then assigned a case involving the minority group.  The rookie proves to the bigot that people are the same, despite their physical differences and they slowly become friends.Mandy Patinkin is great here, conveying the idea of an outsider who is not totally familiar with his new environment.  James Caan is fine, but doesn't seem committed to the film, and his performance is a bit uneven.  Terence Stamp is hurt by his makeup, as his face is one of his greatest strengths as an actor.  Much of his characters come from his facial expressions and the makeup inhibits this.The story is a bit cliched, but the sci-fi gloss keeps things from falling flat.  The tv series was better able to explore the racial allegory, as the film just doesn't have enough screen time.  The mystery component is pretty much standard fare.  If you look beyond the surface of this film, there are some worthwhile ideas here.  They just get a bit lost in the cop trappings.

The movie revolves around aliens who are living on earth...Caan can't stand these aliens, and really takes to disliking them when his partner is killed by one.  He volunteers to be the partner of one of the aliens so that he can use the alien to find out what and who was behind his partner's death.  During this time being partnered with the alien Caan's character learns to actually like being around him and they end up becoming friends.  This movie has good action and comedy as Caan's character tries to figure things out and learns about his alien friend's different weaknesses and strengths.

Detective Sergeant Matthew Sykes (James Caan) & his partner Detective Bill Tuggle (Roger Aaron Brwon) stumble upon an armed robbery involving several Newcomers, during a shoot-out Tuggle is shot dead by a Newcomer. Determined to find his partner's killer Sykes volunteers to partner the first Newcomer (Mandy Patinkin) to make detective & use him for his own vendetta. However the situation becomes critical when the mismatched duo discover a prominent Newcomer named William Harcourt (Terence Stamp) making & selling a dangerous drug that is as addictive to Newcomers as Heroin is to us...Directed by Graham Baker this is an odd film that on the one hand is so clich√©d it's untrue but on the other feels like no other film I have ever seen. The script by Rockne S. O'Bannon at first glance would pass for a generic Lethal Weapon (1987) or any other buddy buddy cop film rip-off, the two films are incredibly similar including the mismatched partner's (one of whom gives the 'we ain't pal's or friends' line to begin with), the plot revolving around drugs is almost identical to Lethal Weapon, there's a car chase at the end, the final bad guy confrontation, the two partner's using their unique styles to question suspects, the fact that one hates the other at first but then grow's a mutual respect for them by the end & if you take away the sci-fi alien aspect of Alien Nation then the two films are virtually identical. However what saves Alien nation is that sci-fi element, in Lethal Weaopn there were racial tensions because of differing ethnicity but here in Alien Nation the idea is taken to the absolute limit as having two cops teamed up who aren't even members of the same species! This is where most of the interest in Alien Nation comes from, there are some really good character driven scenes including Sykes trying to tell a joke to his partner or explain what a condom is for instance while his Newcomer partner tries to present his people's side of the situation. This angle of the film isn't as deep or throughly explored as it might have been but that's another reason I like Alien Nation, all the obvious allergies to racial hatred & tension aren't too heavy handed, too forced, preachy or totally drown out the thriller aspects of the film.Director Baker does an OK job here, he keeps things moving along at a decent pace although I'd have liked a bit more sci-fi in it. I mean the film isn't even set in the future & as such it has dated a little bit. There's a pretty cool car chase at the end & a couple of good shoot-outs but the appearance of an alien monster at the end felt a little out of odds with the rest of it. The alien make-up is OK if a little unimaginative, they just look like bald people with a mottled pattern on their scalps. I am not sure about this but apparently there are two versions of Alien Nation floating around, one with subtitles for when the Newcomers speak in their own language & one without the subtitles. I saw the version without subtitles & it did get quite annoying not understanding what they were saying to each other. The original musical score for Alien Nation composed by Oscar winner Jerry Goldsmith was rejected in post production for being 'too weird' even though it was complete to be replaced by the Curt Sobel soundtrack now heard on the final edit.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 Alien Nation didn't have a huge budget but it does look good with good production values, special effects & Los Angeles location filming. The acting is good especially from James Caan who is great in this (did he have his gas cut off in the end?) while Terence Stamp is unrecognisable under all the make-up.Alien Nation is an odd film since it is so clich√©d & by the numbers except the alien angle which really does transform it from an average buddy buddy cop film to a throughly decent sci-fi thriller. Followed by the Alien Nation (1989) TV series which ran for twenty three episodes & the made-for-TV film Alien Nation (1989) before another five made-for-TV films including Alien Nation Dark Horizon (1994), Alien Nation Body and Soul (1995), Alien Nation Millennium (1996), Alien Nation The Enemy Within (1996) & finally Alien Nation The Udara Legacy (1997) seem to have rounded things off.

I'm not sure, you be the judge.I'd wager that more people are familiar with the short lived early 90s Alien Nation TV show (and its series of a half dozen or so follow up TV-movie sequels) than with the original film. I have only the vaguest memories of Alien Nation's original theatrical run in 1988 (now that I think about it, it's actually kind of odd that I didn't see it in theatres, as I used to chase down virtually every horror or sci-fi flick that came down the pike back then), so I imagine it must not have lasted long at the box office. Naturally I have seen the movie numerous times on video and cable over the years, and though it's a decent enough buddy cop movie (of which there were far too many in the '80s) with a sci-fi twist, I'd have to say I prefer the TV series version overall. The theatrical film doesn't dig very deeply into the Aliens' culture, background, or customs other than a few quick, perfunctory scenes (usually intended as comic relief, i.e. the aliens being given unintentionally funny names by Earth immigration officials like Harley Davidson or Sam Francisco, their fondness for getting drunk on spoiled milk, the fact that they have two hearts, etc.), in fact they seem to gloss over most of the questions viewers might have about the Newcomers. It's as if the script simply said, Hey! Here's two cops! One's a human, one's an alien! OK, now let's go shoot some stuff up! The TV series dug deeper into the differences between the humans and aliens on all these levels and more, but then they had the luxury of an hour TV episode every week and didn't have to shoe horn everything into a compact 90 minute run time like the theatrical film did, so I guess I'd have to say that the film provided a decent enough start.Our story it's 1991. Three years earlier a space ship full of humanoid looking aliens bred for slave labor on distant planets crash landed on Earth and the occupants -- dubbed Newcomers --were given rights to integrate into Earth society and live and work alongside humans. As the film opens, rough and tumble L.A. cop Matt Sykes (James Caan) loses his partner in a convenience store shootout with a couple of Newcomer holdup men, which agitates Sykes' already-racist views of the aliens (he prefers to refer to them by the slur/slang term slags). When the police department promotes a Newcomer patrolman to detective (more as a public relations move than anything else), Sykes volunteers to partner up with him, not out of any interest in human/Newcomer relations, but as a way to use the new guy to help him get revenge against the guys who killed his friend.From there things pretty much settle into the standard buddy-cop formula, as Sykes and the terminally polite, by the book Detective Francisco (played by Broadway veteran Mandy Patinkin of all creatures!) scour L.A.'s underbelly for clues, shake down various human and Newcomer suspects, get beat up a few times, and eventually uncover a huge plot involving a rich, powerful Newcomer (Terence Stamp) and his plans to manufacture an addictive substance from the aliens' past on a wide scale.Special effects (other than the multitudes of newcomer characters and their distinctive spotted-head makeup) are kept to a minimum in Alien Nation, which is actually a strength rather than a detriment to the story. It keeps the film gritty and realistic looking (as realistic as a movie of this type could be, anyway). There are no laser guns, flying machines or other whiz-bang, science fiction gadgetry. If this film were made today, Terence Stamp's metamorphosis scene at the end of the movie (when he overdoses on a Newcomer drug and changes into some sort of particularly nasty mutation) would probably be CGI'd all to hell and he'd look like a hulking green monster with tons of teeth and tentacles. Instead, he just looks like an angrier, lumpier version of himself. James Caan is great as the bigoted Sykes, making tons of one liners at his new partner's expense, but of course by the end of the film, after having fought alongside Francisco for the bulk of the movie his attitude softens towards him and Newcomers in general, to the point where the Newcomer and his family are guests at Sykes' daughter's wedding, and as the credits roll we realize that shucks, these two guys aren't really all that different after all...which is a pretty rare message in an action film when you think about it.Worth a look overall but as I said, the TV series was even better.

We can adventure through space in the distant future, or imagine alternative views of our own world. One is free to dwell in a universe free from time or place; to escape the modern world or discover a deeper meaning to that very same world. Review the literary works of Huxley, Orwell, Heinlein, Dick, Herbert, Sturgeon, Ellison, Bradbury, Vonnegut, Le Guin, and others, each adept at propelling the reader into strange, parallel, or wildly disparate realities. Keeping in the spirit of this topic, let us picture the arrival of an alien race to earth. After a lengthy quarantine, they are released to dwell amongst the inhabitants of America. There is, of course, an inherent level of racism that develops against these new members of society. The narrative ideas are vast this ancient race struggling against a government where they are not represented; pointed social commentary on the civil rights struggle and of race relations since; these foreign beings coping with the garish culture of the United States; examining the class structures of immigrant populations; something, anything..........What we end up with, however, is ALIEN NATION, a film that is essentially a cop/buddy flick starring James Caan and Mandy Patinkin. They are out to stop a drug lord and avenge the death of Caan's partner before they retire (or something to that effect). The point is is that ALIEN NATION, other than having Patinkin in outlandish makeup, offers nothing new to the tired clich√©s of this genre. Caan plays a veteran detective named Matthew Sykes, who after the death of his best friend/partner sets out to solve the crime himself. He is teamed with Sam Francisco played by Patinkin. Now Francisco is a newcomer, a member of an alien race, bred for slavery, and whose native language closely resembles the peaks and valleys of a heart monitor. They learn at an incredible rate (hence they speak English) and get silly on sour milk. Salt water can disintegrate their flesh (a popular contrivance in late 80's cinema, WARLOCK being another example) and have bald spotted heads. At first Sykes is harsh and unwelcoming, but after a night of booze and rancid dairy products, he warms to the good natured Francisco. It would seem that the slag that killed Sykes' partner is involved with a scheme to distribute a drug that was rationed as a reward for hard labor on the slave ship. They begin to suspect the involvement of a wealthy newcomer, William Harcourt, played by Terence Stamp (who, alas, had several more years of films like this before he made a comeback with THE LIMEY). This drug, in normal doses, produces enhanced strength, and in larger quantities causes a kind of gigantism. I'll stop there, but you can see where this is going.........The frustrating thing about ALIEN NATION is that so very little of the newcomer culture is explored by the writers. We get bits here and there, but they are mainly used for comic effect or as plot devices. They have two hearts, but why? In the obligatory morgue sequence (replete with a coroner eating a sandwich), the aliens are shown to have no genitals, but a stripper in a later scene is shown to have breasts. Do they nurse their young? Are they warm blooded? I may be over analyzing these points, but they are valid in creating a plausible alternate race. The actors do what they can Patinkin, an odd choice for a role such as this, is pretty good at bringing a sort of wide eyed innocence to the character of Francisco. On the other hand, James Caan seems to have a hard time taking this material seriously; his performance is functional, but he seems on the verge of breaking out into laughter during certain scenes. The direction, by Graham Baker (THE FINAL CONFLICT), is somewhat uninspired and there are few memorable sequences to speak of. The musical score by Curt Sobel (who replaced Jerry Goldsmith, after his lively, though weird, music was rejected) adds very little to creating an aural signature for the newcomers. Stan Winston contributes fine creature makeup, although the incarnation towards the end appears almost identical to the monster from PUMPKINHEAD which Winston directed the same year ALIEN NATION was released. The film is, admittedly, mildly entertaining, in a goofy sort of way, but I couldn't help wanting more development from the narrative. There were several made for television movies and a series spawned by the film, but from what I understand these continuations offer little in the way of expanding the scope of the original concepts. To make a long story short, ALIEN NATION generates many interesting questions, but instead of answers, there are car chases. Oh well.......4/10 "},{"Title":"Don't take it personally.

It's what gives focus to the relationship between detective Matt Sykes (James Caan) and his 'Newcomer' partner Sam Francisco (Mandy Patinkin). That's a great speech by Sam/George where he laments how humans have failed to live up to the same potential they have offered the aliens. Makes you think about how we really haven't improved all that much as a society over the past twenty years.Watching the film the other night, I was struck by how much blatant product placement went on in the picture - subtle ads for stuff like Tasters Choice Coffee, Smirnoff Vodka, and repeated images of those Bartles and James guys before they went down in a hail of gunfire during the convenience store robbery. There was even a marquee for Rambo III playing in theaters at the time; I wonder why they offered free time to a competitor.I was probably more intrigued by the memory of this picture than the film itself; as I watched it the other night I thought that the second half moved rather slowly. I'm having a hard time understanding why the villain Harcourt (Terence Stamp) went to such great lengths to protect his investment in Jabluka, when for all intents and purposes, the aliens could get it anywhere. I mean really, today you can buy Tide in a dozen assorted flavors.And speaking of tides, it was rather noble to see George risk his life to save a buddy by hanging out over an ocean full of battery acid. You don't have to be an alien to know that that was a wild and crazy thing to do. I thought about how all that salt spray should have been hitting George in the face, but then you wouldn't have had the dramatic save for this buddy movie to end on a high note.

These beings were originally bred as slave labor. Once on Earth, the find new worlds opened to them they never imagined, and they also find the ugly side of bigotry from the humans.So they begin to adapt to everything in the new world. From displaying intellectual strength, to falling victim to some of mankind's worse vices. And that is where this story comes into play.Matt Sykes is a grizzled, jaded police Sargent played to perfection by James Caan. He's estranged from his daughter, despite her efforts to mend their relationship. He's also not a fan of the newcomers, often referring to them as slags. One night, he long time partner on the force is killed in a shoot out by one of the new comers. Ordered not to investigate the crime, but looking for justice, Sykes plots away.He agrees to team with Sam George Francsico (Mandy Patinkin), a police officer promoted to Sargent as part of a new policy implemented by the mayor. Sykes uses a partnership with George to investigate the death of his long time friend and partner.Soon, he realizes he in for more than he bargained for as a seeking of revenge as turned into a fight against an illicit drug that if put on the streets, could make the newcomers slaves all over again. The man at the head of this crime wave, the same one that played a role in the death of Sykes partner, is newcomer William Harcourt, played by Terrence Stamp. Stamp plays a role just as evil as his classic General Zod from Superman II.The issue is that Harcourt is a man held in high regard by Los Angeles society and powerful. He's won several awards for his charitable work. Now it's up to Sykes and Francsico to expose Harcourt for what he really is.The climax of the film is a well staged and intense fight that takes place on a boat. Sykes dispatches Harcourt by shoving him into the water, seeing how the newcomers' bodies react fatally to salt water.This was clearly one of the best sci-fi movies of the 80's and perhaps, one of the best all-time. It gives a flawed hero in Sykes who manages to overcome his own bigotry and forges a new friendship with his new partner, and friend, Francisco. The movie spawned a short lived TV series that become a cult classic.I highly recommend this movie to any serious movie fan, because this film is so well crafted, it has appeal that reaches beyond any specified genre.

James Belushi has also featured with a canine partner, as indeed has Tom Hanks. There was American/Japanese 'Black Rain' with Micheal Douglas, and even an item called 'Haven' in which one of the cops was an android. I cannot find that movie referenced on the IMDb, though it was quite fun. 'Robocop' pursued the theme with a human, female partner. There has also been '48 Hours' whereby a white cop teemed with a black crook, slob versus slick. This time the aliens really are alien, though sufficiently humanoid to be un-challenging. Apart from a lack of ear-lobes and a tendency to liver-spots on the scalp, they might pass for human beings. And, of course, white ones. Their appearance certainly didn't tax the special-effects department. If one were to cast about, stranger-looking humans could be found. It's a pretty lacklustre effort crammed with clich√©s, but is lifted out of the ordinary and given serious intent by the choice of James Caan in the starring role. Caan is a man who knows how to act, and he can be very expressive in an oddly undemonstrative way. It's all done with facial expression and body language. His scarcely concealed racism and contempt for cultural nicety is executed with aplomb, and as the aliens are not even humans, the subject is a ripe field for harvest. The chemistry between himself and his alien partner develops well. Both actors deserve good marks. It could hardly have been easy working with that sweaty cranial prosthetic. The other actors play their parts without express merit or criticism. A barely-recognisable Terrence Stamp has a lot more to offer than he was required to give here, and I wonder at his inclusion in such a limited role. I thought he was wasted. But his gravitas and slightly unplaceable English accent helped highlight his alien persona in such a manifestly American movie.Otherwise, you've seen it all a dozen times before. I was disappointed that the aliens brought no new technology. And nothing of any original value appeared to have been scavenged by either them or us, from their downed spaceship. That seemed highly unlikely. Even damaged technology can be understood and replicated. And if they survived, the ship must have been more-or-less intact. The species vive-la-difference routine was - well, routine, and unsurprising in its surprises. The aliens' favourite foods prove disgusting to human sensibilities. Gosh; that's clever. They drink sour milk rather than fresh. But apparently not cheese. They eat raw meat rather than cooked, and so on. They are soluble in sea-water, but not drinking water. Presumably, they themselves do not contain salt then. In a world so dangerously briney as ours (2 thirds of its surface are ocean) perhaps they would be happier and safer on the moon. There's a humdrum joke about the purpose and size of condoms - oh-dear. And - surprise, surprise - their females are vain and bitchy, and play the same 'seductress' card that human females have played since time immemorial, even having jobs as pole-dancers etc. I mean, come on! It's not exactly imaginative, is it? The plot is about the control of dangerous drugs. This time they're dangerous to aliens. And in an inevitably predictable turnaround of learning-curves, the hide-bound, by-the-book, alien side-kick starts to break the rules; the laissez-faire human cop learns to kerb his chauvinism; and in due course there is reconciliation and mutual respect all round. To describe this movie as science fiction is just a pose. There is no scientific/cultural prognosis whatsoever. Any study of our conflicting and contrasting aspirations is barely touched upon, never mind explored. The idea that these people would be allowed to wander freely amongst humans and develop their lives without the most careful scrutiny is quite absurd. Such liberal thinking certainly wouldn't have outlived 9/11. It is irrational socialist twaddle to suppose that two species of intelligent organisms could thrive side by side on the same planet in some sort of harmonious ideal. Just look how often things break down with our own species. Consider how the indigenous American Indian is still treated today. There is no reason to suppose that we would regard them any differently from a mutated chimpanzee, and exploit them for medical and pharmaceutical advantage. After all; even a normal chimp is intelligent, communicative, self-aware and has theory of mind. It is certainly more cognitive than a human with advanced Altzheimer's disease, and yet still no-one would ever dream of elevating its simian status above that of the vegetative human being. And this despite the fact that we have a common ancestral thread. We are, in effect, their animal cousins. Are we going to usurp them then, and confer equality to beings with which we share no heredity whatsoever, whilst still treating our nearest evolutionary relatives as 'animals'? That is neither rational nor just. Besides; Darwinian logic suggests that one species must otherwise out-compete the other, sooner or later. This happened on Earth many times before. Why should things be any different because one species has spotty heads and drinks putrid food? These 'newcomers' were just a ticking time-bomb.As an intelligent evaluation of inter-species relationships, this item was just vacuous and juvenile. Check-out 'The Day Of The Dolphin'; that was streets ahead. On the other hand; taken for what it actually is - a cross-cultural cop movie - it's an entertaining though predictable romp. James Caan alone redeems it from the ordinary. A TV series followed without him, and cemented its formulaic mediocrity for ever.

When the first Newcomer police officer, Det. Samuel Francisco (The Princess Bride's Mandy Patinkin) is assigned his new partner, he gets Det. Sgt. Matthew Sykes (James Caan), who still has issues about Newcomers. They are searching for the people who killed Sykes' partner, and investigating the Newcomer underworld, and especially Newcomer leader William Harcourt (Terence Stamp). It is both a friendship growing partnership between Sykes and 'George', oh, and I should mention Newcomers can be killed by water, which causes an acidic reaction to their skin. Also starring Kevyn Major Howard as Rudyard Kipling, Leslie Bevis as Cassandra, Peter Jason as Fedorchuk, Conrad Dunn/George Jenesky as Quint, Jeff Kober as Joshua Strader, Roger Aaron Brown as Det. Bill Tuggle, Tony Simotes as Wiltey and The Terminator's Earl Boen as Duncan Crais. With some good action sequences, a good buddy-buddy films, a good sci-fi thriller. Very good!

It was obvious why it was so short lived because it followed a standard formula of a hard bitten veteran cop getting teamed up with an innocent or unlikely partner . Veteran doesn't like innocent partner but they bond and innocent partner wins veteran's respect as they crack the case together ALIEN NATION brings a gimmick to this formula and that is one of them is an alien ! You see an alien race have come to Earth and Ronald Reagen allows them to stay and a few years later the aliens try to assimilate to Earth ways . James Cann plays tough cop Matthew Sykes whose partner is killed in a shoot out and gets partnered by alien newcomer Sam Francisco One can't help noticing the potential to ALIEN NATION . We don't learn much about the aliens and perhaps mindful of this the producers thought there'd be a lot of mileage in bringing out more sequels expanding upon the aliens culture . As it stood the film didn't do very well but a television series was quickly commissioned and just as quickly cancelled but did lead to a continuation via a series of made for television films It's easy to understand why ALIEN NATION wasn't a big box office success . Film makers like Paul Verhoeven were really pushing the boat out with violence round about this time and even when it was released ALIEN NATION seemed slightly tame . It's also a film that tries to bring a bit of satirical humour such as a scene where RAMBO 6 is advertised at the cinema and the humorous names of the visitors  Rudyard Kipling no sh*t !  but there isn't enough of this in the film "},{"Title":"Aliens in America,  cheesy but quite fun","Date":"4 August 2010","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" In the not too distant future, Aliens have landed in America. The nation has been forced to accept them; giving them citizenship, jobs, and English names. There are now just as many Aliens in the country as there are humans. Detective Sykes has just lost his partner is a shootout with some Alien streets thieves. The next day he agrees to be partners with the newly appointed detective Samuel Franscisco (an Alien) The further they proceed in their investigation for the partner's killer, the bigger the game becomes, and Sykes may have to put revenge issues aside in order to prevent something more potentially dangerous to the planet.Alien Nation feels pretty much like a throwback to the days of Earth vs. the Flying Sausers or Plan 9 from Outer Space. Such cheesy material is impossible to take seriously, but luckily the makers of this picture are aware of that. They add a subtle but useful dose comedy to the film. While it is easy to look at the movie allegorically, Alien Nation is best approached as a strait forward buddy movie. It is still fairly cheesy, but enjoyable nonetheless.The movie is driven mostly by the interplay of James Caan and Mandy Patinkin. Their screen presence is delightful, as they bounce one liners off each other until the movie decides that it is time to go into action mode. The climax is a bit loony, but not terribly harmful. I think I can give Alien Nation a pass. It's low brow-material, but it makes some good decisions, the most important of which is acknowledging its silliness. (Battlefield Earth could've leaned a lesson or two from Alien Nation) "}{"Title":"Copy buddy movie with a twist","Date":"13 March 2000","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":"  It's ok.Not exactly a ringing endorsement, but there are much worse films around.

Or even semi-average.   What's wrong with Alien Nation, you might ask?  Well, first of, this IS NOT a sci-fi movie.  I know - it's set in the future, aliens come from another planet and co-habitate amongst the humans, there's alien prejudice, alien blue collar workers, alien cops, alien hookers and the whole nine yards.  But with all this promise, what do the film-makers do?  What, I ask you?  They turn it into a COP/BUDDY MOVIE!  The guys who wrote this should be forced to take remedial writing lessons from Joe Eszterhaus.And everyone involved must have been caught at a bad time in their lives.  Caan has been much better than here (though not much worse) as a cop who doesn't like aliens and is, naturally, stuck with one as a partner.  His partner (Patinkin) gets a cute name at Ellis Island (Sam Francisco...  yuk-yuk-yuk.), gets drunk on curdled milk and makes Star Trek's Spock look like a party animal.  Then there's Stamp as yet ANOTHER alien baddie (remember him in Superman II?).  Not much stretch work here.Not much to the plot, either, as Stamp plans to enslave the aliens with a newfound version of a drug from the old home planet (and when you find out what the drug is, think would this mean that all the sober aliens walk around in dirty clothes?).In fact, the best thing about this movie, aside from the alien make-up job, is the song Invincible from the Temptations, a golden oldie, according to the movie, from 1988.  Ah, the ironies of a movie set in the future.Tell you what - remember movies like Freebie and the Bean and Lethal Weapon?  Pretend one of the guys is a bald-headed alien with large liver spots on his head and no nose.  There, you've seen Alien Nation.Two stars.   And if you make it through Alien Nation, may the (police) force be with you.

However, Coneheads is actually a little better than this sometimes painful to watch sci-fi drama about a group of aliens who land on Earth and ever so slowly learn to be accepted among the Earthlings even going so far as to help a group of cops solve a murder. This film is not for all tastes and I reluctantly sat through it before judging that it's certainly not for my taste.

Action, comic, whatever the kind I follow them diligently. Some snatch your admiration, and some cause the excruciation. We all are in search for the perfect buddy. However, there is no wholly perfect anything or anyone ! Movies understood that early. So they put many deficient heroes who could approach completeness, the ever lost completeness, if they passed most of their differences, and put their imperfections together. But, some movies' buddies were too imperfect to stand ! So let's review the top of their most unbearable ones in the past 30 years 10_Roger Rabbit in (Who Framed Roger Rabbit &#x96; 1988)  too noisy, not droll, and unhelpful. He was the worst of this excellent movie for sure. And something just eats you about him being married to the Foxy Jessica Rabbit, does it ?!09_Chris Rock in (Rush Hour &#x96; 1999)  The fastest mouth in the west !!? well, I can tell you one thing  he's the fastest turn-off ever! How come that his name comes first above Jackie ? How come that he was paid more than Jackie ?! How come that he appears as Jackie's sidekick or beside him in the first place ?!! 08_Dana Carvey in (Wayne's World &#x96; 1992)  Yes, Myers is nice. But Carvey isn't. His persona, his way of talking, his look, his EVERYHING seemed ultra-silly. 07_John Adames in (Gloria &#x96; 1980)  for sometimes you might think that they came up with the Razzie award's idea, in the same year, only because of him. Few times in American movies where the performance was as bad as this (it's bad to a classic extent !). So in the catalogue of the bad acting you'd find Adames's picture ! If you didn't watch the movie, just do it for one scene  the I'm the MAN scene ! 06_Stephen Bladwin in (Fled &#x96; 1996)  I think that they originally picked him for nothing but being so white in front of Laurence Fishburne ! Now this is the way how Not to deliver comedy ! It comes with another feel this time  silliness ! He's one of the worst partners anyone might have, or WE can watch ! 05_Josh Hartnett in (Hollywood Homicide &#x96; 2003)  when one of the 2 leads is the tragedy of their movie ! The movie wasn't that good, but sure Hartnett is that bad ! I'll save myself the trouble; just look at his eyes and judge by yourself !04_Dennis Rodman in (Double Team &#x96; 1997)  when I first watched the movie I said what's THAT ?! Are you beeb kidding me ?! I had a problem seeing him among all the earrings, the colored hair and the outfits ! This movie is a complete confirmation of something has been said in (Men in Black)  that Rodman is an Alien ! Actually he makes that monster in Alien's movies as America's sweetheart !03_Hooch in (Turner & Hooch &#x96; 1989)  the ugliest dog a cop could ever have ! True that he hasn't Chris Rock's gibberish, Dana Carvey's hair, or Stephen Bladwin's hilarity, BUT he has a white sticky long droll.. Which beats all of that already !02_Norman D. Golden II in (Cop and ¬Ω &#x96; 1993)  Burt Reynolds got an awful kid as an accomplice, sorry I mean adjutant, and we had a perfect crime ! Yes, dance happily John Adames, because there is someone who's worse than you anyway ! Though, it's not Norman D. Golden' fault only, it's the fault of anyone didn't notice how un-charismatic, unfunny, untalented, un-anything watchable this kid was. Suffice it to say that his smile looks frighteningly evil !01_Mandy Patinkin in (Alien Nation &#x96; 1988)  defines nightmare of a partner and movie ! OK, so at least James Caan got money for being in this garbage, but the poor us got Patinkin' look, this garbage as well, and nothing more than a taste of deep disgust. I can't forget, after years and years of watching, the moment in which Terence Stamp's character got killed (or dissolved !) it forced me to ask  how low Hollywood can go ?! And undoubtedly Patinkin IS the worst of the worst partners I have ever experienced in a movie. I can't believe his appearance. I mean nobody ever laughed, or stopped to object  what the hell we're doing ?! He was more hideous than Whoopi Goldberg's dinosaur partner in Theodore Rex (This dinosaur is too cute in comparison!). Anyway when after finishing a movie I wish from god that I need not to glance a bit of it again or a shot of its lead once more, then it must be a horrible movie, and he must occupy the top of this list. (And they made sequels to it ???! OH GOD. Have mercy on yourselves before us !). Finally, if you already have a dear friend as anyone in this list, then it can be your best buddies list ! I know, everything is varying for everyone. Otherwise how the makers of these movies didn't see How Silly this group (of gents, kids, rabbit, dog and alien) was !
