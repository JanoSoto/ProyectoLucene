I read the other accounts of the movie and I couldn't help by get very emotional reading the words of praise for Geraldine Page's memorable performance.The night she won the Oscar was big news in New York, where she lived and taught.  One news program's crew visited a cafe where Miss Page's students were watching the ceremonies on tv.  When F. Murray Abraham opened the envelope and said, ...and the winner is the greatest actress.. her students began to scream and cry BEFORE her name was called.  They KNEW who had won, and so did I.  I wept right along with them, just as I had done when I, a former actor, realized that very few actors would ever reach her level of artistry.I watched Bountiful over and over in disbelief.  Her scenes on the bus with Rebecca de Mornay were wonderful and very touching.  I kept wondering HOW did she prepared herself for this?!!!  When she rode, with the Sheriff through what was left of Bountiful and uttered, My God, will you look at Bountiful...  Her walk through the old house and her gaze as she looked at the land, the trees and the birds reminded me of a visit to the old country town of my childhood, reminding me that everywhere I've ever been is still there, perhaps in a different form, but it's still there.The reason that she got that standing ovation from the Academy Awards audience, is that it was appropriate to honor greatness and that the Oscar was going to an actor that TRULY deserved to win.In an age that Oscars are won for okay performances, when, in other years, Oscars were truly given to deserving achievements, AND, the competition was much, much stronger.I cannot recommend this picture more.  For any aspiring actor that wants to set a goal standard for greatest, he or she must see this performance.

Though trying admirably to do the right thing by the two women in his life, the situation is tense.Carrie yearns to return to the family farm where she grew up, hoping to recapture some of the happiness of her youth.  She has even tried to run away a few times, only to be stopped by her son and daughter-in-law who, in spite of their differences are only trying to spare her the disappointment of what she may find.Her hometown, Bountiful, now basicly no longer exists.  The people just used up the land and moved on.  All that remains are a few abandoned and deteriorating buildings, including her childhood home.  Nevertheless, Carrie finally succeeds in slipping away.On the way, she meets a young wife, Thelma (Rebecca DeMornay), whose husband is overseas in the military behind enemy lines.  As they converse, it is obvious they are both on a quest, Carrie to recapture her youth and Thelma to hold on to hers, not knowing if she will ever see her husband again.  Until he returns, she is going back to stay with her parents.  The two women form a bond and find each other a source of strength on the long bus ride.  Though we hope for Thelma's eventual happiness, somehow we know that only disillusionment awaits Carrie in Bountiful.Filmed as a play with the advantages of outdoor scenery, the entire cast and crew did a splendid job, presenting a difficult subject in a tasteful manner.  Page won an Oscar in what was to be her last role shortly before her death.  Besides the other supporting players, Richard Bradford was also outstanding as the compassionate Sheriff who helped Carrie obtain her goal.  The period pieces, all of those old 40's automobiles and the architecture and scenery, the general feel of small-town Texas during that era, helped add to the realism of the film.  THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL should be recognized as a national treasure.

And it's no wonder why. The movie almost unfolds as a Broadway play. It may seem depressing at first, but that's the gift that Geraldine has in portraying the emotions of an aging Southern mother who yearns to return to the small town she left in Texas many many years before. For whatever reason, this film hits an emotional chord with me because Geraldine Page reminds me so much of my maternal grandmother. If you're into fast paced, action flicks - or comic farces, you won't like this film. But, if you really appreciate character development that slowly unfolds and develops in a film, you should not pass up this one!

Getting on in her years, and equipped with a bad heart, her only wish is to see her home on the southern coast of Texas (Bountiful) before she dies. She has often attempted to go there, but always seems to get caught before she can even get on the bus. But one glorious day, she does manage to escape the confines of the apartment and her critical daughter-in-law, and thus, her adventure does begin. Mrs. Watts encounters a delightful young lady (Rebecca de Mornay)and relates her life story, sings hymns to her heart's content, and finally, through sheer will and perseverance, does make it to Bountiful, where she discovers that her one time home is now a timeworn shell. Here, she rediscovers her past, and all of the emotions she experiences and shares with us are to be treasured for generations to come. Geraldine Page is so masterful and in every frame of this monumental film, that we tend to forget that she is even acting. Her character could be our grandmother, our mother, and we come to love this eccentric character as though she were family. One of the most charming movies ever made!

Charles Bronson once said that what big movie stars have is presence, not acting ability. Page has both of these attributes here in spades, acting and presence.This great film could be my grandmother's story but in reverse, as my grandma had a very caring daughter, my mother, but a resentful son-in-law in my father so I saw a very similar story first hand, which made me appreciate this film all the more.Page did a marvelous job of showing the immense disconnect between two diverse generations, one raised early in the 20th century in an era of intense religious devotion and the other raised 40 years later in a WWII era of emerging personal independence. The resulting conflicts between the loving son's selfish and demanding wife and his self-sacrificing mother was the entire story until her eventful trip back home to Bountiful, Texas. Wanting and praying so hard to be able to take her last trip home consumed her entire life as she gracefully but tearfully faced her hateful daughter-in-law's cruel harshness each and every day, with her unfortunate son forced to try to act as mediator. John Heard was effective as her concerned son caught in the middle.Page was marvelous in the special way she showed her character's intense religious devotion and principles in how she always treated all people with decency even when they were not that way to her, and in how she tried her best to get along and be friendly in the face of intense dislike and resentment. Understandably, her all-day hymn singing got on her son's wife's nerves, just as my Grandma's incessant hymn singing got on my dad's nerves and forced the same conclusion....both old ladies were practically forced to leave.Page's son loved both women dearly but he was forced to be in the difficult middle ground, wanting to please his jerk wife and his nice mom but was increasingly unable to do so, thus the long bus trip back home for mom was an inevitable run-away trip that left the son in an even greater mess....now what to do?On her bus trip home, Page's character's live and let live understanding of humanity, and her awareness that we are all in the same boat here on earth(even though it was God's glorious boat to her)led her to reach out to a fellow bus traveler with immense friendliness and compassion in the best manner of her religion's teachings. Rebecca DeMornay was perfect as that fellow bus traveler, a prim young military wife on her way to her husband. And, even though Thomas Wolfe was right when he wrote that you can never go home again, Page showed the perfect combination of wonder and sad acceptance upon seeing her old, run down, country home place again after so many years away in the big city.Though her caring son finally came to retrieve her back home to whatever improvements he had worked out with his wife, at least she got to see the old home place one last time. She could now rest in peace no matter what. See this great story just to fill your heart, and to see that people in this country once were just like Page's character, and it was a better place for it. Movies don't get any better than this one. If you loved this film you will also love Places in The Heart.

It is the story of an old woman's return to her pre-Depression home, and the memories and regrets that the journey invokes.Mother Watts lives with her son Ludie and his wife Jessie Mae in a two-room apartment.  Life is cramped.  Mother has to sleep on the couch, everybody in the apartment is constantly getting in everybody else's way, physically and emotionally, and the neighbours can hear every word. Mother Watts is a country girl in spirit, having been raised on the land, and her yearning to get away from the rootless, joyless suburbs eventually overwhelms her ...The film is set in the nascent middle-class suburban environment of Houston, Texas in the 1940's.  Ludie and Jessie Mae are a typical couple in their early middle years he is hoping for a salary raise, so that he can afford a house and a car, she inhabits a narrow psychological world of nice clothes, coffee shops and picture shows.  Ludie's mother lives with them, and this irritates Jessie Mae intensely.  The two women clash repeatedly as Jessie Mae constantly seeks to assert her ascendancy within the household.Mother Watts is a simple soul.  She sings the hymns she learnt as a child as she goes about her dreary chores (Jessie Mae does no housework). Mother receives a monthly pension cheque from the government, and this seems to be the only reason that Jessie Mae tolerates her presence.  The daughter-in-law clearly regards the cheque as her own property.The old lady inhabits a world of reverie, an intuitive, emotional world of memories.  The full moon keeps her awake all night, as it did when she lived in the rural community of Bountiful, some 20 years previously.  In the glow of the moonlight, she hankers for that idealised country life.  When Jessie Mae switches on the electric light, its harsh glare ends the dream-time abruptly, stark modernism cutting Mother Watts' links with her own personal history.Mother Watts resolves to make one last trip to Bountiful.  On her way she encounters obstacles (she has enormous difficulty cashing her cheque) and disappointments (death and progress have transformed the Bountiful of her memories).  However, she also meets with the kindness of strangers. Thelma, the young woman who is travelling her way, befriends her and shares confidences with her.  Mother Watts reveals that two of her children died in Bountiful - one of diphtheria, one of sheer poverty.  The local sheriff (Richard Bradford) undergoes a change of heart and helps the old woman to revisit the place of her dreams.When Ludie and Jessie Mae finally catch up with the wandering old lady, Ludie momentarily glimpses that other world, the world of soil, simplicity and communal spirit.  Jessie Mae is of course impervious to Bountiful's charms, and she seems utterly out of place in her white high-heels.The 'message' of this nostalgic little film is that people who live on the land put down roots which sustain them them through hardship and sadness, whereas the shallow urbanites have nothing to bolster their bland existence.  Mother Watts may have lost two babies, but she is infinitely more fulfilled than Jessie Mae, who has never had any children.An excellent period feel suffuses the film.  The early scenes in the apartment are suitable claustrophobic, helping to develop the theme of 'hemming-in'.  By contrast, when Mother Watts begins her bus ride, the screen opens out into an impressive panorama of land and sky.  We feel that this will be Mother Watts' final adventure in life, and this elegiac quality is subtly underscored by clever touches we see her behind a glass panel at the bus station, with the lettering Houston Terminal Cafe obliterating her face.Geraldine Page is great as Mother Watts, keeping her character simple and humble, and resisting the temptation to 'grandstand'.  John Heard impresses in the role of Ludie, the slightly downtrodden son who strives to do the right thing.  Again, the characterisation is spot-on ... Ludie is dull and inarticulate, and Heard grounds him in bathos.  Carlin Glynn has fun playing the awful Jessie Mae, and Rebecca de Mornay is first-class as the sweet-natured Thelma.A restricted palate can sometimes produce the most powerful effects. The final scene, where Mother Watts gets her fingers in the dirt one last time, is a terrific climax, built up slowly and patiently, and relying purely on the interplay of characters.

Fond & painful memories of family, friends, & farming are all there & she'll get there again if it's the last thing she does, because the desire is so intense. Her life (in a cramped apartment in Houston with her dullard son & his shallow Coca-Cola drinking wife)after she sees Bountiful once more can actually be bearable because she'll be at peace with herself & her roots. The scene where Mother Watts opens up to a kind stranger on a bus speaks volumes about how you can live with someone & not even know them. She opens her heart to this woman, but her own family were oblivious to her pain, yearning, & heartbreak. Had her son truly known his mom's feelings, he might've just taken her there. A truly touching scene is when she finally gets there & sits on the porch of her deserted former home. She feels as though her mother & father will walk out of the house & greet her.

Geraldine Page has got to be the best actress of all time.  The only one I can think of who comes close is(was) Jessica Tandy.  In Ms. Page's role for this film, she brings to life and light the plight that so many older, widowed people are facing daily.  In the place where I work, many of our clients could easily be Ms. Carrie Watts. (I work at a Legal Aid Society).  The empathy she creates  as she brings Ms. Watts to life is astounding to me.  She really, really gets it.  To be sure, John Heard's portrayal of Ms. Watt's son Lutie was flawless as well - the strain he feels trying to please both of the most important women in his life is almost palpable.  Again, this is so close to real life that it breaks your heart to watch it.   Carlin Glynn's portrayal of Lutie's hard-headed wife Jessie Mae brings me to tears at several points in this film, no matter how many times I watch it.  You can't help but feel aggravated with her but also angry at her for her treatment of her mother-in-law.

Other commenters have quite rightly lauded the brilliant performance of the late Geraldine Page, but lost in the shuffle is just how damn good John Heard also is in this movie. His character is all about failure and disappointment and trying not to have to face your past. (You get some of the same feel from the corrupt cop he played in the Sopranos.) The first time I watched this movie, I was awestruck by Page, but the second time I saw it, I realized the movie is really more about Heard's character, and why he is so intent on keeping his poor old mother from seeing her home town, a request that on its face seems fairly reasonable.Carlin Glynn is also superb. Her character is actually a lot more complicated than one might think from reading the comments. To cite just one example There is a scene near the start of the movie where the childless couple is retiring to their separated double beds for the night, and she looks over and sees him reading a book called something like How To Succeed In Business. From earlier scenes, we know that Heard's character is going nowhere. Carlin Glynn's character, although a social striver, still loves her husband, and seems not at all resentful about his obvious shortcomings (in the way she is about her mother-in-law's presence). When he tells her the title of the book, she just gives him a kind smile. Does Hollywood even know how to tell a story anymore about someone who is both likable and unlikable? In the real world, aren't there a whole lot more people like that than like any of the characters you see in the movies? This movie is filled with understated scenes like this one.

But 1962 was ripe with excellent female nominees including Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn and the winner that year, Anne Bancroft.The Trip to Bountiful was a small, intimate film about an unhappy, elderly woman who yearns to visit her girlhood home before she dies.  She has tried, unsuccessfully several times before, but was stopped by her loving son and disapproving daughter-in-law, skilfully played by Carlin Glynn as Jessie Mae.Once on the bus to Bountiful, Mrs. Watts meets a lovely young girl played by Rebecca De Mornay in whom she confides.  Miss Page was wonderful here with every nuance, side glance and gesture.  Her years of experience as a stage and film actress showed loud and clear.  She was brilliant.  This prompted actress, Shelley Winters to comment, this is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.Scene after scene, Geraldine Page, does what few actresses can do, breathe REAL LIFE into a character. Her physical aliments and limitations are not exagerrated, but felt. Her emotional highs and lows speak volumes and you find yourself sharing her inner feelings.Carlin Glynn deserved a nomination as Best Supporting Actress.  But, I suppose the Academy members were so enthralled with Miss Page, they couldn't SEE anyone else on the screen!The supporting cast was strong. I especially liked Richard Bradford as the Sheriff who personally takes Mrs. Watts on her trip to Bountiful.  The scene where Page peers at her old home and says I can almost see my father walk out of this house... was heartbreaking.

It scares me that older people can be so extremely dominated by their relatives as Mrs. Waits was. Her Social Security check was nabbed by the daughter-in-law before she ever touched it. And the daughter in law also kept saying No More Singing! to her.I'm 65, and a musician/singer. My late husband was controlled in his last days by people who had hidden agendas. I certainly did not know what all of these agendas were! There were philosophical and medical battles going on over his care, between various HMO departments, and battles among family members about who got what after his death. Items he treasured disappeared from his apartment while he was still living.My mother is 90, and we make sure that she makes as many of her own decisions as she is able to do. My sister has not claimed her legally allowable status as power of attorney, thus taking control of Mother's finances and her every decision, the way my late husband's son did against his father! The very fact that Mrs. Waits had to sneak and excape from her own home was sad indeed -- particularly since she had to sneak in getting her own Social Security check from the mail carrier.Even though this is a very beautiful and touching film, The Trip to Bountiful has more to it than at first meets the eye the rights of the elderly are staring us right in the face!

The gentle tale of the woman's wily escape from her family is told in a simple straightforward style that does nothing to detract from the glory of Geraldine Page's career-topping performance as Carrie Watts.There are no histrionic scenes in the film of the type that generally capture Oscar attention. Page's performance, however, has such depth and heartfelt, yet subtle, emotion, that the viewer is immersed in her quest to return home, and only the hardest stoic will be dry eyed when she sits on the porch of her parents' derelict house and says that she almost expected her father and mother to greet her at the door. Obviously Oscar voters in 1985 left tear stains on their ballots.Carrie's journey from Houston to Bountiful is filled with memories as she relates pieces of her past to a young woman en route, to the night clerk at a bus station, and to a local sheriff. The people she meets share more of her past than her dull son or shrewish daughter in law. Although the supporting cast, which includes John Heard, Rebecca De Mornay, and Richard Bradford, is fine, each member underplays his or her part in such a way that they enhance and do not detract from Geraldine Page's work. Carlin Glynn's selfish daughter in law is the only character that tries to compete with Page.When Carrie hears that the last friend she had in Bountiful has died, one can feel the empty hollowness and loneliness that such loss brings through Page's eyes and body language. Hers is a performance that commands attention from the first scene without flamboyance or mannerisms. She captures and holds the viewer with her soul and her deep understanding of the character and the character's need and yearning to return to the last place where she was loved. The Trip to Bountiful is haunting, heartbreaking, and yet ultimately uplifting.

Being a native Houstonian and the fact that I love nostalgic trips back in time. This film reminds me so much of my own mom because she was from a small town in Texas just like Bountiful and moved to the big city of Houston in the 1940's. From time to time we take her there and she points to where the school used to be and where they used to hang out as kids and so on. Many of her friends and family are now gone and only exist in memory for her. Sometimes we have to imagine what it might be like for us when we are that age. She always said when your young you really don't think much about life 40 to 50 years from now. She even has a daughter in law devil just like the one in the movie. Thank God she doesn't have to live with her. Geraldine Page was another rare talent we will always miss. I recall seeing her in Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice and I knew she was a great actress. This movie inspired me because one day when I am ready to go, I want to go to my childhood home and see it for the last time too.

Geraldine Page masterfully plays an old woman who is determined to outwit her bossy daughter-in-law so that she can visit her childhood home. Her portrait of this elder is a fusion of desperation, wisdom, and all but emotion being diluted by time. There is a lot of shrewd spontaneity in her performance that challenges her co-stars. Carlin Glynn provokingly takes the part of the imposition of the succeeding generation, an interfering, self-consumed woman Page puts up with only for the sake of her son, Glynn's broodingly compliant husband, played by a very likable young John Heard.The script is exceptional in its unfussiness, as all the narrative obstructions to Page's fraught yearning to replenish herself with a nostalgic visit to her old home of Bountiful don't seem to phase her. This is a touching recognition of the seasoned nature of many elderly people, as Page, despite how miserable it must be to be intimidated by someone thirty years younger than you into remaining in their apartment passing away the time in a chair and a window, for the most part alone, as we first see her in the film, and to reminisce about the bygone times and lost relatives, is beyond the sort of anger and frustration that would set a younger person in a rut. This, however, is merely my twenty-year-old male opinion, though I would say that is a testament to the effect of the movie.Beautiful Rebecca DeMornay creates a wonderful character, a sensitive young woman who meets Page by happenstance and projects a wonderfully virginal, serene presence. She opens Page up, just as Richard Bradford's humble, taurine middle-aged sheriff does. The Trip To Bountiful is not a brilliant film. It's simply an enjoyable and engrossing piece of work.

The mother catches her son and lifts him to her chest and hugs him deeply and there is a warm start to what will be a great story on the human condition through the aging of time.From the Golden Field serenaded by a hymn the future is laid upon us and we see the Mother, 40 years later rocking in a chair staring out a window in a city apartment humming a hymn. Meet Geraldine Page the Oscar winner who portrays Carrie Watts, A Woman determined to go back to her rural country hometown Bountiful and relive the moment. Carrie lives with her son Ludie portrayed by John Heard in his city apartment along with his wife Fannie Mae who dislikes the humming of hymns. Fannie Mae is a pain in the ass caught up in new post war II bourgeois Caucasian existence.The film follows Carrie on her adventure to get to Bountiful and the petty events that try to stop her. Rebecca Demorney fills the screen for a brief moment and reminds us how beautiful youth and innocence is and how kind we all can be as strangers.A lyrical and teary eyed experience.

It's colorful, well-paced, gorgeously costumed and designed, and (assuming that you're not too cynical to enjoy a sentimental story for what it is) it's a totally absorbing and compelling two hours.Most of the characters of the drama are complicated enough to keep the film from getting too predictable, and certainly, in the hands of the great Geraldine Page, it would be hard for character NOT to be deeply interesting. Mrs. Watts is somewhat similar to Cousin Sook in the beautiful Truman Capote memoirs Miss Page performed in the late 1960's, but she has far richer monologues throughout the film that could not better underline her extraordinary skills.However, in spite of all this, I think the film is rather lacking in substance. It's QUITE sentimental, and while it never degenerates into a lament for the snows of yesteryear, it comes pretty close to it. Although there is some resolution of family tensions toward the end of the story, we never really get a terribly convincing demonstration of HOW the title's trip to Bountiful managed to bring this resolution about.For that, I tend to fault the screenplay--and perhaps I'll feel differently about it after another viewing.But that alone is characteristic my wish to see it again at some point is PURELY because I want to admire Geraldine Page--and NOT because I found the story and film so moving. It's HER that I wish to watch, not the film.And so, I guess, as a compromise, I'll give it 8 stars...but everybody should understand I have two extra stars in parentheses for the star of the movie who could not have been a more deserving recipient of an Oscar that year.

So many users have already given it accolades; what else is there to write ? Once again, I stumbled on it on TCM in the middle of this film. I'd always wanted to see it. People who have not experienced the closeted atmosphere this plot depicts (several people living in a small apartment) are truly lucky - I have and am, although I'm not directly involved.Peter Masterson has directed a masterpiece from Horton Foote's script, although I doubt seriously if he had much to do with Geraldine Page's (Carrie Watts) performance. She WAS Carrie; she portrayed this eccentric lady with a revelation seldom achieved by anyone. Although I missed the first half of the movie, I didn't need it - I could understand each character's personality clearly, although there were some whom I really didn't want to understand. But, isn't that life ? I did not recognize John Heard (Ludie Watts). He was perfect for that character, as was Carlin Glynn (Jessie Mae). Didn't you want to choke her? A fabulous performance. In the confines of their apartment, Ludie knew he was a failure in his life, because he had neither the courage to reprimand his wife nor gently accompany his mother to her dearest place on earth. He left that up to the Sheriff (Richard Branford)....another stellar performance.Every scene in this movie, I'm sure, was a gem, carried by Ms. Page. I was certain it was going to be Thelma (Rebecca de Mornay) to take Carrie to Bountiful.....she was so kindly aware of Carrie's predicament. Yet, that would have prevented the redemption of the other characters. Ludie's confession and demonstration of his love for Carrie; Jessie Mae's shock to receive the sweet kiss on her cheek by Carrie, who accepted all of the demands of the list. A touching shocker when Carrie let the magic of her life sift through her fingers as she scooped-up a handful of earth.....you know she saw her mom and dad on the porch.We all will make a Bountiful trip, either actual or imaginary. I'd jump into my auto right now, if I thought it would make it to Mississippi. Flying would be too abrupt - it's the build-up to the ultimate desire to re-connect with the past.

So this character-driven movie was one that had crossed my radar but it wasn't something I felt compelled to see. At least not until last night.I found it on Hulu about a week ago.

Well, it didn't rain last night...and there it was on the queue in front of me. I paused, then finally clicked 'play' and voila. I will be completely honest here. I loved the opening credit sequence, but as soon as the music stopped and the first scene began, I didn't like it at all. It was very stage-bound, at least in the beginning. After three minutes, I almost turned it off. The remote was in my hand, and my fingers were itchy. Change it. Turn it off. Find something else, the remote seemed to be saying. My remote control speaks to me sometimes.I almost did not have patience for this film. But maybe I got lazy or my itchy trigger finger on the remote calmed down, I do not know for sure. But a few minutes later, the lead actress had captured me. It was the way she sat in that chair. I can't explain it. It was a moment when the performer just totally gave herself over to the role. And the character came to life and I was drawn in...I had to see how this was going to continue playing out for the next 100 minutes. And so it went, and I remained glued to the screen. And this wound up being the best film (certainly the best performance by an actress) I had seen in a long time. And thirty years is too long a time to have deprived myself of it. It didn't matter if parts were stage-bound-- we were on a journey, this character and me. This actress and me. And we took a trip together.To Bountiful.

So Ms. Close, don't give up your hope yet, please live long and prosper.THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL is an adaptation of Horton Foote's eponymous play, sets in Houston in 1940s, Mrs. Watts (Page) lives with her son Ludie (Heard) and his wife Jessie Mae (Glynn) in a two-room apartment, for almost two decades, Mrs. Matts tries to visit her hometown, Bountiful, an obsolete town being forgotten by any train or bus schedule, for the last time, however, Ludie and Jessie Mae can always pre-empt her plan in the past years, this time, after a sleepless night and the quotidian spat with Jessie Mae, plus a sinking spell may indicate that she has some heart problem, Ms. Watts ramps up all the courage and she must go back to Bountiful on her own, with the pension check she smartly concealed from Jessie Mae.Luck is also on her side, finally, she dodges Ludie and Jessie Mae's search in the bus station and befriends with her fellow passenger Thelma (De Mornay), a young married girl whose husband is dispatched to the war zone, on the bus to the nearest town from Bountiful. A quasi mother-daughter bond builds tenderly while they confide their stories en route. When Thelma leaves for her destination, Mrs. Watts stays over in the local station until the Sheriff (Bradford) arrives to inform her that Ludie will fetch her up at the morning. Out of despair, Ms. Watts plead the Sheriff to drive her to Bountiful, allow her to see her old house for the last time before Ludie arrives.This is a featherweight indie picture, with a handful of actors, spanning merely two nights and two days, Page's Mrs. Watts is always in the centre of the story, she is a country girl in spirit, crammed in a small apartment and crashes with an ultra-selfish Jessie Mae in every possible way (the hymn, the pout and the gait), as she pointedly confesses to Thelma - when you have a son, when he marries, you lose a son, but if you have a daughter, when she marries, you get a son! She is too benign to defy Jessie Mae since Ludie is a weak- minded man, a mother's self-sacrifice is inbuilt, her longing for the land where raises her is the only getaway from a grating reality. Ms. Page pitches at every note of emotions precisely in her warm and endearing performance, looks rather older than her real age, she doesn't possess any idiosyncrasy or appeal to be a figure under the spotlight, Mrs. Watts is such an ordinary old woman one can meet everyday and pay no attention of, but thanks to Foote's very personal and unostentatious script, her mere dream is amplified into a universally affecting pursuit of fulfilment, particularly edifying for us, as our parents are in the same range of Mrs. Watts, homesick, nostalgia and past memories become all they have in the world. In retrospect, it is rather astonishing to realise from Houston to Bountiful it only takes more or less 10-12 hours by driving, how come Ludie never brings his mother to visit for once is quite baffling, he is not that callous kind. John Heard's acting is not at the same clique as Page's not only because Ludie is a pretty dislikable character in default, his only great moment is his big confession scene, otherwise, he is a bland actor. Carlin Glynn's Jessie Mae, on the other hand, excruciatingly hammy, but frankly speaking, Glynn saves the day by injecting a patina of self-awareness which underlines maybe Jessie Mae is not a complete damaged good, she is an egocentric virago for sure, but she is not the evil kind, she is not entirely hostile towards Mrs. Watts, her life is also stuck in a stifled status quo, sometimes we stupidly and unintentionally discharge our dissatisfaction towards those who are near us, it's just human nature, no misogynous overtone is agitated. In a word, THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL is Ms. Page's showpiece to the hilt, a star-making device aiming for that golden statue and it succeeds, but you could say it is a fair play, and in 2014 a TV remake with a core black cast with Cicely Tyson, Vanessa Williams and Blair Underwood, verifies that this old yarn is still relevant nowadays.

Back in 1953 aspiring playwright Horton Foote did this as a play on Broadway. It had a very limited run even with the presence of Lillian Gish in the starring role. 32 years later now a successful screenwriter Horton Foote adapted his flop play to the screen and it brought home an Oscar nomination for best screenplay adapted from another medium.More important this work brought home an Oscar for Geraldine Page after seven nominations without the big prize. Geraldine will keep you glued to your seat watching this film, her performance runs quite the gamut of emotions. Page plays a widow living with her milquetoast son John Heard and his domineering wife Carlin Glynn. For Glynn the only value Page has is the Social Security check she brings in every month to keep the family going. In fact Glynn grabs it every month to make sure the bills are paid. Truth be told we learn that Heard was laid up with some undisclosed malady for a couple of years and now is starting with a new company and a new job in Houston. Still that money is something Glynn has gotten used to controlling.I can identify with Page in her longing to return to familiar places and surroundings and get away from her daughter-in-law. For her what she wants most to see is Bountiful, Texas where she grew up.My guess is that Horton Foote growing up in Texas himself saw a lot of towns like Bountiful go belly up, probably because there was oil there at one time and now the fields are played out. That's what's happened to Bountiful, the bounty ran out. But that does not deter Page one single bit.As good as Page is in her role I think some recognition should be given to John Heard and Carlin Glynn in the Supporting categories. I can't believe neither was nominated, especially Glynn. Also Rebecca DeMornay has a fine part as a young wife journeying to join her in-laws while her husband is overseas.No doubt that Horton Foote wanted to keep the setting in the Fifties when the play was written and the film was successful in doing that. But the story is a timeless one and could easily have been done in the year of 1985 when it came out.Geraldine Page is wonderful in the part that finally brought her the Oscar. But the whole film is a well done piece of ensemble casting and the best in direction. Most of all it's for fans of Geraldine Page.

Horton Foote has the ability to take a simple situation and make it a marvel of writing and style with a gentle touch, but considering that gentle touch and style so much as conveyed that a person comes away wondering how it was accomplished. You are given not only a feel for the people, but the wonder of the place where it takes place. Bountiful may or may not have been real, but in this story it is and to Carrie it's more real than anything else in her life and more important then anything that she get to see it one last time before her life is over. To reach this end she defies her irritating daughter-in-law who not only bow beat her, but her son; husband to the daughter-in-law.

Geraldine Page pours her heart and soul into the role of Carrie Watts, an elderly widow who lives with her son and daughter-in-law in a cramped urban apartment, and who wants more than anything to make one last trip back to her rural roots.Homely in appearance, Carrie is quite a character. She's feisty and spunky, insistent, slightly forgetful but not senile, yet charming and likable. And she likes to hum gospel hymns. Her son is something of a sop married to a talky, overbearing worldly woman annoyed at having to share their small flat with his mother. Verbal conflict abounds.Yet the story centers on Carrie's desire to return to her old homestead before she dies. The script neatly conforms to a standard three-Act structure, with the final Act being the most sentimental. Page's performance is so riveting and multifaceted that we forget how much dialogue there is and, as a result, the film never seems talky. But the script does play with the viewers' emotions and, as such, is quite manipulative.Production design and costumes wonderfully capture the 1940s setting, especially in the nighttime scenes at the rural bus stop and in the small town, where naturalistic lighting and ambient background sounds render scenes highly realistic.Carrie's story is the story of many older people. It's what happens naturally when someone has lived a long and full life, to reminisce about the past, to yearn for its return, to grasp the reality of change, and to come to terms with the inevitability of one's own mortality.Despite a manipulative script, the film's underlying concept conveys genuine heart and soul.

The supporting cast offers able support to what really should be regarded as a one-woman show, for which the actress won a well-deserved Oscar.

The real stars here are Glynn and Heard, and it's a tossup as to which actor is better, for neither is as accessible as the Page role. Glynn's role is as a seeming bitch, but we never really believe that, as in several moments throughout the film we see she really does care for her mother. Heard's character never has problems showing he cares, but he is a classic hen-pecked type. Since abrasiveness and seeming cowardice are not valued traits, it's no wonder both Foote and the audience sympathize more with Mother Watts, and this is why she is the de facto lead, even if her tale is the least interesting, and most predictable, of the three- especially when we learn that two of Ludie's siblings died in that town, in childhood. The character played by DeMornay is, by contrast, merely a plot device to get inside Mother Watts. With that done, her exit from the film is anticlimactic.The film got mixed reviews on its release, but even those who praised it did so for the wrong reasons, lumping it in with lesser nostalgic schlock like The Color Purple and the later Driving Miss Daisy. There was also the critical cribbing regarding Mother Watts' first name, as well as some claims that the film has flashbacks, due to the opening credits scene where we see a young Mother Watts and child Ludie running through a field of flowers. But, since this is the opening shot, and is never repeated, it cannot be a flashback. The film could be considered a flashforward, but given the bulk of time spent in the film's present, this is ludicrous. It does, however, amply show the problems many critics have in dealing with art that does not conform to their preconceptions, nor the promotional material they are given. The film's main themes song, Softly And Tenderly, sung by Cynthia Clawson, is memorable, but scoring is not a strength of this film.The Trip To Bountiful has many great points and moments, but it is not a great film, for the translation between media is a difficult thing to pull off. But, the film shows the failure of much contemporary writing, with an over-reliance on diurnal description and rote explanation, whereas true characterization comes from observation- the viewer being to observe what and what not the character does, and how that has an effect on the character, even if the whole observational process is discreetly exhibited. This film is a great example of characterization at its finest, and even though it does not achieve overall greatness in this medium, it small failures point out the way that the truly great works of the filmic medium do achieve it. Thus, it recapitulates much of the learning process that the tercet of main characters undergoes. Not bad for a failure, eh?

What she's doing in this movie is stupendous, one of the few performances ever by an American actor which stacks up against the best that the Brits can do. For me the movie then progressed on two levels one carrying a mundane, sentimental story which barely engages; the second a mesmerizing and utterly believable journey in the company of a dauntless old woman traveling to bring her life to a satisfactory completion (all things considered). Toward the end, one expects death but gets life, carried on the wings of perhaps the best acting performance ever delivered in an American movie.

Besides the performances...Geraldine Page gives her best, Carlin Glynn plays the neurotic; self absorbed, daughter-in-law to perfection. John Heard as the son is amazing....and he saves his best for the last 15 minutes of the film.  Even Rebecca DeMornay underpays her character and is the perfect choice for a role I would have never cast her in.  EVERYTHING, from the opening, title sequence with singer Charlotte Church's haunting voice, to the cinematogrophy, is absolute PERFECTION !  Geraldine Page desreved 3 Oscars for her performance.  RENT IT, BUY THE VIDEO...(is it out on DVD yet ?) WATCH IT !!!! And get out your box of tissues !!!!!

She fits the bill perfectly here in her crusty portrayal of an elderly woman, with a heart condition,who wants to return to her home for one last visit.She currently lives with her son and daughter-in-law, the latter doesn't exactly want her around either.After a bus trip, where she encounters a kindly young Rebecca De Mornay, in a good performance, Page reaches her destination and pulls out all the emotional stops when she comes to her former home.Page was never better in this remake of an original TV movie of the early 1950s which starred Lillian Gish.

Geraldine Page is the consummate artist as Mother Watts. Mother Watts is a true commentary of the tragic displacement of some of the elderly, living with her self-absorbed daughter in-law while fending her off from snagging her monthly pension.

Their relationship forms much of the core of the film's character-driven tale, although the story itself is slowly paced and riveting only because Miss Page is such a consummate actress.Based on Horton Foote's 1953 TV play, it provides a meaty role for Miss Page as a woman tired of living with her son and daughter-in-law in a cramped household and longing to return to Bountiful, Texas to recapture old times. Once you settle into the story, it provides a warm, nostalgic feeling and is impressively acted by the entire cast.Well worth viewing, if only for Page's heartbreaking performance.

Sometimes it's an example of sheer brilliance, Citizen Kane, for example, but often it's something deceptively simple like Cinema Paradiso, Il Postino, Le Grand Chemin. Significantly those last three titles are European (for that matter Orson Welles was a 'European' filmmaker in all but country of origin) but very occasionally an American filmmaker will produce the goods. The Trip To Bountiful is the goods. Led by a truly luminous performance that inspired the entire supporting players to raise their game. A total delight. "},{"Title":"Too quiet, too slow","Date":"9 December 2008","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This takes place in the 1940s. Carrie Watts (Geraldine Page), an elderly woman, is living with her son Ludie (John Heard) and his wife Jessie Mae (Carlin Glynn). Ludie is henpecked by Jessie Mae and Jessie treats Carrie like dirt. All Carrie wants is to visit her home town before she dies. Ludie and Jessie won't help her so she decides to go on her own.This is one of those quiet movies that people (mostly critics) fall all over themselves praising. Page won a well deserved Oscar for this but, aside from her acting, this is a slow-moving and frankly dull tale. Perhaps it worked well on stage but it certainly doesn't transfer to film. I have no problem with quiet slow-moving movies at all as long as they're interesting or innovative. This is neither. I knew exactly where this was going and exactly how it would end up. There were no surprises at all. Page's excellent performance doesn't disguise the fact that this is a totally predictable and boring movie. Just because a movie is quiet and slow doesn't automatically make it some work of art. Worth catching for Page and Rebecca De Mornay (a passenger Page meets on the bus) but little else. To make things worse the character of Jessie Mae is so unpleasant and cruel that she becomes a caricature. I don't blame the actress Glynn for it--I blame the writing. A slow, dull, wildly overpraised movie. I can only give it a 5.

I won't waste a foot writing some long review that no one wants to read anyway. I read such good reviews for this movie, and the plot sounded nice. I tried, but I couldn't enjoy it. I felt the story, about Mrs. Watts wanting to see the place she grew up in before she died, but it was all like a long, drawn out sentence. I felt sad for her because of the way she lived.. and all.. I mean, I understand that it was trying to be a sad movie. I HATED the character of Jessie Mae. I mean I HATED HER. And when I hate a character as much as I HATE Jessie Mae, then it does something to the movie. I was waiting for Heard to slap her, or something!! Geraldine Page annoyed me at times. Like a little kid. On the other hand, John Heard looked mighty good in it.   Not for me though. "}]
