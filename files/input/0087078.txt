The original, classic Conan the Barbarian was a hit, but the Hollywood bigwigs decided they could get x-amount more money if they made a more family-friendly sequel, thereby opening the franchise to the lucrative kid's market (never mind that, for as long as there have been restrictive movie ratings, kids have known how to get to see the movies they want).  Take out the sex, tone down the violence, crank up the humor, and... out comes this movie.It's like Destroyer is stuck in a state of half-development.  The basic storyline would be okay, but the script gives Conan a coterie of unneccessary sidekicks (as if Conan were not a strong enough character to carry a movie by himself).  Grace Jones is interesting to look at but gets tiresome VERY fast; the cowardly sidekick gets more irritating by the second; Mako wears this expression like he's only in this one for the money. Olivia d'Abo is just plain miscast it's like she's a marker that should read Insert More Interesting Character in Second Draft.  Arnold Schwarzenegger does a competent job as Conan, but we don't see the raw power and brute force of the first movie.  There is a thin line between competence and complacency, between an actor and a star; it took Roger Moore six years to get to that point in the James Bond series, while Schwarzenegger reaches the same point with Conan in two.I think part of the problem is whether or not the Conan concept is flexible enough to become family fare, and my answer is no.  Fans of Robert E. Howard's Conan work know his Cimmerian is a very rough-edged hero, a cunning, hard-drinking, hard-fighting man, and the first Conan movie captured that essence.  To change him into the simple-minded do-gooder of Conan the Destroyer is to destroy what Conan is all about, and the movie suffers for it.Is Conan the Destroyer worth watching?  Yes.  For someone who knows absolutely nothing about Conan, I suppose it can be a harmless sword-and-sorcery popcorn flick.  For Conan fans, it's kind of like Legend of the Lone Ranger for Lone Ranger fans an irresistible example of just how badly Hollywood can treat your favorite character.I just hope that if there is ever another Conan movie (not likely, thanks to Destroyer), the producers will concentrate on following the style of Conan the Barbarian and just ignore this one.

But Universal, seeing star Arnold Schwarzenegger as appealing more to younger audiences, did not like the R-rated combination of gore, sex, and machismo philosophy of the first film, so Milius was unceremoniously dumped, and more family-friendly action director Richard Fleischer was brought in to helm CONAN THE DESTROYER. Working with a script by comic book scribes Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, much of what made the first film so unique was tossed aside. While Milius had Arnold lose weight and study Oriental swordsmanship, in an effort to tone down the bodybuilder look, and make him more flexible and believable as an arena-trained warrior, Fleischer ordered the actor to bulk up as much as possible, hoping to recreate the impossibly-muscled giant painted by Frank Frazetta on the covers of the paperback CONAN novels. Instead of being a taciturn loner, Conan would joke and 'care' about people, with an idiot sidekick (Tracey Walter) to provide comic relief. Bloodletting would be mainly off-camera, sex would consist solely of flashes of cleavage, and any monsters faced would be toned-down so children wouldn't be traumatized. While all this succeeded in garnering a PG rating, the end result was less Robert Howard's barbarian, more the generic B-movie hero seen in the dozens of imitations CONAN THE BARBARIAN had inspired.The plot is simple; Cruel but beautiful Queen Taramis (SUPERMAN I and II villainess Sarah Douglas) promises to revive Conan's dead love, Valeria, if he'll lead virgin Princess Jehnna (Olivia d'Abo) and her bodyguard (basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain), on a quest to steal a giant diamond, and use it to recover a horn that will bring god Dagoth to life. Joined by his sidekick, Malak, a wizard (Mako), and a female warrior (Grace Jones), the group faces the usual array of monsters, wizards, and enemy soldiers, and defeats them all, succeeding in the quest...but Conan discovers, nearly too late, that the bodyguard has been ordered to murder him, after the horn is retrieved, and that Jehnna is to be sacrificed as part of the process of reviving Dagoth...While the fight between Conan and Toth-Amon (Pat Roach), in a hall of mirrors, is well-staged and exciting, much of the rest of the film seems flat, with one scene, of Conan blind drunk at a campfire, ridiculously out of character and silly. CONAN THE DESTROYER didn't achieve anywhere near the success of the original, but Schwarzenegger had no reason to worry; his next film would be a low-budget SF thriller called THE TERMINATOR, and he was about to become a superstar!A footnote to CONAN...in early 2003, Schwarzenegger and John Milius tentatively agreed to bring CONAN THE KING, the final chapter of the saga, to the screen...With the original director's vision, and the improvements in FX that CGI has provided, we may yet see the ULTIMATE Conan film reach the screen, if Arnold's political career doesn't take precedence!

Conan the Destroyer is pure Hollywood cheese, made because the Conan the Barbarian was such a hit. The studio execs made the story more light-hearted, with sidekicks and magic and the kind of story a thirteen-year-old could watch without getting in trouble.Oddly enough, it works. While it's light years away from Robert E Howard's original Conan stories, Conan the Destroyer is still great fun, even twenty years after it was made. Arnold Schwarzenegger makes the most of the very silly lines he's given, Tracey Walter proves a capable if somewhat pointless comic foil, and the irony of casting Wilt Chamberlain as a protector of a young princess' virginity is hilarious.Mako hams it up, Grace Jones takes it all too seriously and Olivia D'Abo makes for a good childlike princess because she was 16 when the film got made. The music's over-dramatic, the lines are laughable (Some wizard you are! Go back to juggling apples!) and the story's clich√©, but for Saturday night viewing, nothing beats Conan the Destroyer.Possibly Interesting Trivia This movie was produced by Raffaela De Laurentis, daughter of the famous Dino De Laurentis. She also produced the confusing big-budget epic Dune. Both Dune and this movie flopped at the box office, and both were filmed in Mexico.

For this reason alone I am rating this film as 6/10. Do not expect a continuation of the first Conan film. 'Conan The Destroyer' is too light in its scope and Conan is not the same man anymore. The villains are also not as menacing.Having said that it was good to see Grace Jones and Sarah Douglas and also Conan's companions had good lines and were very funny at times.As a side note I found the adjective 'Destroyer' in the title quite misleading and unfortunate. For those of us that read the Conan novels we see Conan driven by his own motivations, and fighting his battles only if he had to and not for the sake of destroying. The film distributors could have picked something else to promote the movie.

In fact, I would say that this is excellent bubblegum sword and sorcery fodder except for a few minor, but annoying quirks. For one thing the comedy sidekick Malak is phenomenally irritating, badly acted, and takes any tension, interest etc out of any scene. Clearly they were going for a wider 'family' appeal with this film, but this was also clearly a decision made some time down the filming process. Most obviously this hits home during the fight scenes with some very choppy cutting as some of the more gruesome bits have been removed. And Conan's second encounter with the camel suffers from this too! That aside the cast carry off their roles with aplomb, Grace Jones in particular really getting across her character's zest for and love of combat. One of the better hack and slash films out there.

Along this journey, accompanied by the princess of whose kingdom worships Dagoth and her giant guardian, Conan will find others to assist him along the way as they come across heavy resistance and danger to their mission to retrieve the horn.I've read many considering this a homage of sorts to Seven Samurai, and while it does contain a group joining forces to defeat a powerful enemy, this is more of an adventure tale with sword and sorcery(..absent the nudity and gore from Conan the Barbarian which actually appeals to those yearning for the more gratuitous elements sacrificed to obtain a larger audience). Quite an eclectic group we follow, too. Grace Jones as a tribal warrior. Wilt Chamberlain as the princess' guard who we all know could turn on Conan any moment. Mako as a powerful magician whose saved from nearly being a feast for a cannibal tribe. Jeff Corey as a thief who swallows gems he steals. Olivia d'Abo, the virginal princess who secretly desires Conan. The most unfortunate decision was a limited Sarah Douglas who is perfect as the sinister Queen Taramis who wants to sacrifice d'Abo so that she can command Dagoth to do her will, with designs on ruling the world..she gets little screen time which is a shame, because she's so wonderfully evil Instead the film spends a lot of time on the journey with Conan, Bombaata(Chamberlain), and princess Jehnna(d'Abo)gathering up allies, encountering opposition, providing fans with plenty of swordplay. A little bloodier than I had remembered, but nowhere near as ultra-violent as Conan the Barbarian. Arnold Schwarzenegger was in fine form during this period, but the movie doesn't demand him to flex in acting muscle, just his pecks when he wields his sword at his adversaries. Most often chuckle at Chamberlain's performance, but, let's be honest, we all know he was hired for his towering presence not his acting chops. Grace Jones goes all out as she normally does, with a giant stick, battling men with swords, eyes bulging, hyena screeching, the works. The Mexico locations provide this film with the proper setting needed for warriors battling in caves, deserts, and under the hot sun. Far less serious approach is applied here compared to Conan the Barbarian which might be why it received less critical reception. Most of the graphic violence is shot away from the viewers' eyes, certain to earn a PG rating, but what did the filmmakers sacrifice in return? Contains another masterful Basil Poledouris score, adding a riveting thrill to the battles not to mention providing Conan with a majestic aura.

But I haven't watched this movie for a very long time, so the other night, I was in a weird mood, I decided to watch the Conan movies. So The Destroyer was more familiar to me. But the thing is, this movie is a sort of break through for Arnold, since this movie was a flop at the box office, he doesn't like sequels, The Terminator being his only exception. So I was curious as an adult if this movie really was as bad as it's made out to be, I liked it a little bit when I was a kid, but when you're a kid, you're fascinated by anything. So watching this movie, as cheesy as it was, I still had a good time watching it. I understand why a lot of people have a distaste for it, it's definitely not up to par with the first Conan, it's more of a comedy vs. adventure. But I still enjoyed this movie, it's a good bad film that entertained me.Conan and his partner, Malek, are brought before Queen Taramis, who asks that Conan perform two tasks for her obtain a special gem and retrieve the magic horn that can awaken the god, Dagoth. In exchange, she offers to resurrect Conan's dead lover, Valeria. Conan agrees. Conan, Malak, Jehnna, the queen's niece, and Bombaata set off on their journey. Along the way, Conan enlists the aid of his old comrade Akiro and the group later encounters Zula, who joins the party. They then set off after the magical horn, which is kept inside of a mysterious fortress. Jehnna retrieves the horn. After some difficulty from the cult residing in the fortress, they try to make their way back to Queen Taramis however, Bombaata betrays Conan and takes Jehnna, leaving the others to fight for their lives.The story is a bit much and it's not the same as the original, but if you give it a fair enough chance, I think you'll enjoy it too. It is a bit more comedic and steers away from the original story, but I think the comedy still made it fun. I loved the addition of Grace Jones, she was one tough chick and could stand proudly next to Conan; even if she did have a silly Japanese anime type of look to her hair in the end. I loved the costumes and the special effects and of course, Arnold. Conan is the part that he was meant to play and he carries the movie well with the other cast. Granted I know the direction isn't really good, it does have a more cheesy vibe as this was the same director for our favorite barbarian box office flop that was Red Sonja. There are a lot of plot holes and a script that could us a more than a few touch up's, but give the movie a fair enough chance, don't compare it to the original, on it's own, I'm sure you'll have a good time watching it.7/10 "},{"Title":"All good fun!","Date":"28 November 2008","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" Sequels are rarely as good as the original, and with a film like Conan The Barbarian to live up to this one had a hard time from the start.And yes, it's not as sophisticated a film as the original, but no it is not a bad film.Running along like a more typical S&S film, the emphasis is more on a runaway action film rather than the screen opera of the original. There's plenty of swordplay, wizards, magic etc. It does feel like it could have had a bit more to it though, maybe another place to visit or another enemy to slay and maybe a bit more depth to the supporting characters but it's not a serious drama and it's a cut above other films of this genre. Also remember, this is the film that most people remember when they think of Arnie as Conan. Sword, loincloth and not much else so it must have struck a visual chord at least.I'm glad they made this film, it's a fun romp and a great way to spend an evening. People will judge it as the weaker film, which it is, but it's also the most fun out of the two.If only King Conan Crown Of Iron was made with Arnie as the old bearded king today it would make a nice little trilogy (Or box set of you throw in Red Sonja which is basically a Conan film!)

Arnold never looked more mightier than here, looking like the true Marvel Comics equivelent of the hero, rather than Milius' or Robert Howards version.

However, the critics were somewhat unkind to John Milius's fantasy epic, stating that it was far too long, far too serious and far too humourless. On that occasion, the critics were wrong - I, and many others, like Conan The Barbarian BECAUSE of its length and its seriousness. The story feels thorough and atmospheric, and the pace is controlled, not dull. It is very sad that this sequel addresses the very things that were falsely alleged to be wrong or flawed about the original. It's as if the makers of Conan The Destroyer sat down and listed all the criticisms ever levelled at Conan The Barbarian, then tried to do something to rectify them. So, this sequel is shorter, more lightweight and more humorous than its predecessor. Does it work? Have these changes resulted in a massive improvement? No. In fact, Conan The Destroyer is actually vastly inferior to the original, and is little more than a juvenile romp aimed at bloodthirsty kids and slightly nerdy adults.Fearsome Cimmerian warrior Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his travelling companion Malak (Tracey Walter, in a bad comic characterisation) are summoned to carry out a dangerous quest on behalf of the treacherous Queen Taramis (Sarah Douglas). She promises that if the quest is a success she will reincarnate Conan's long-dead lover so that he may be reunited with her. The mission requires Conan to take a beautiful, virginal princess named Jehnna (Olivia D'Abo) on a journey to recover a magical crystal. The princess is the only person who can handle the crystal which, when used correctly, will unlock the gateway to an all-powerful horn. With this horn, Taramis plans to awaken a deity and share God-like power with it by sacrificing Jehnna. Along the way, Conan picks up other travelling companions to aid him in his quest, such as the female barbarian Zula (Grace Jones) and inexperienced magician Akiro (Mako). However, Taramis has lied to Conan in order to secure his services; she not only has no intention of bringing his lover back to life, but also plans to kill him once his usefulness is over.Conan The Destroyer is not a total loss - in fact, in some departments it is actually quite good. Basil Poledouris again provides pulsating music (not quite as good as his scoring of the earlier film, but good enough all the same); Jack Cardiff's photography brings the vast sets and varied locations colourfully to life; there are even infrequent bursts of real excitement. But Conan The Destroyer is repeatedly dragged down by its numerous flaws - ill-suited comedy, listless performances, obvious special effects, and an episodic narrative. In particular this last criticism is a major disappointment. The story is episodic to the point of tedium. The characters ride around, chat about love and magic, then arrive at some kind of temple or castle where a little action ensues. Again and again, with irritating repetition and boring monotony, this same sequence recurs - ride, chat, action.... ride, chat, action.... ride, chat, action.... ride, chat, action.... Conan IS a destroyer - but, unfortunately, what he's destroying is his own genre!! "},{"Title":"A cheap, but funny and light-hearted sequel.

Howard's short stories I must say that funny and light-hearted are definitely NOT the words I would use to describe Conan. Destroyer loses the poetic melancholy of Barbarian, but is more accessible (it was the first of the Conan movies that I saw as a kid). The PG rating doesn't harm the tone of the film much, it's still relatively bloody, but apparently Richard Fleischer shot it as a hard R before the producers cut it down.The story this time has Conan go on a mission for the seductive Queen Taramis (she can be my queen ANY day, and look for a quick glimpse of her bush in the first Shadizar Castle scene). He must retrieve a gemstone which unlocks another treasure called the Horn of Dagoth. A treasure that will bring to life an Evil God. Conan doesn't care as Taramis (who was NOT a villain in Howard's short stories, her twin sister Salome however, definitely was) has promised to bring back his dead girlfriend from the first film. And so with his ragtag group of companions Malak (a comedy sidekick, but what happened to Subotai from the original?), Zula (Grace Jones, wearing no more than a couple of inches of leather floss), Akiro (Mako, the only returning cast member from the original), Bombaata (on a secret mission to kill Conan) and the virgin Princess Jehnna, Conan takes off on his mission.The first film was serious but this one plays more like Labyrinth than Barbarian. The effects and sets are very typical of early '80s fantasy movies. Conan talks a lot more too, and has fun in a drunk scene. I don't have a problem with this as he is quite cunning and intelligent in Robert E. Howard's stories, and they kinda sold him short in the first film by limiting his dialogue.Some scenes reek of cheapness. The Toth-Amon/Man-Ape scene is so ridiculously fake it makes you wonder how the filmmakers took it seriously. And the ending, featuring the resurrected Dagoth reduced to a sub-Godzilla demon is just plain stupid. Not silly. Even a few more minutes of thought put into this would have made it much better. But it is all very entertaining it really does is add to the kitschy hokum of it all. And hokum and weirdness is what Howard's stories were all about.Basil Poledouris' music is the one part of the film that is totally up to scratch. It's not as heavy as his score to the first film but he does introduce new, stronger themes and lighter takes on cues from the first. Brilliant stuff.It's a lot more formulaic and 'Hollywood' than the first. No new ground is broken and it's obviously a film made quickly to cash in on the success of Barbarian. Another way in which Conan has been sold short. You can tell with some gimmicks present in both films that they were trying to turn this into a long-running series. A shame that never happened. It really should have been like Bond, with a film coming out every 2 years.Conan the Destroyer is guiltless fun with goofier characters, sillier dialogue, clumsier action, and loinier cloths.

Sarah Douglas as the obligatory evil queen...the only thing she seems to be queen of is sequels (Superman 2, Puppetmaster 3, Beastmaster 2 etc.) and Olivia D'Abo, who is just irritatingly helpless and annoying here.The plot is trivial and the dialogue poor and some of the effects are lamentably bad (look for the island in the lake and the man-ape). Also, did I mention that Grace Jones is just horrible and hisses a lot? I did? Oh well, it bears repeating..All in all, this is a cash-in movie, designed to rake in some easy money on the back of the original and not really caring much about a plot or good actors. Even Arnie, the world's best actor at not saying many lines, is hampered by having too much dialogue.Avoid it unless you want a laugh.

It's all bull though, as the Queen intends to kill Conan and friends once their task is through and sacrifice virgin Jehnna to the god Dagoth.This sequel is OK but nowhere near as good as the first film. More comedy and watered-down violence don't do much to help it. Arnold seems to play this a little tongue-in-cheek at times, unlike the first one where he played it straight. I had a huge childhood crush on Olivia d'Abo from this movie. She's actually one of the better parts, cast-wise. Basketball player Wilt Chamberlain plays her bodyguard Bombaata. As an actor, he's a great basketball player. Mako returns from the first film and is fine. He should have been the only comic relief but alas, we have the terrible Tracey Walter as Malak, Arnold's moronic thief sidekick. Sarah Douglas always makes for a good villain. Lastly, we have androgynous '80s curiosity Grace Jones as the animalistic Zula. She's amusing to watch, though usually for the wrong reasons. Still, entertaining is entertaining.

The basic problem is a common one for many viewers this is a somewhat watered-down, PG rated Conan that just doesn't have a lot of intensity. Ultimately it gets too fantastically silly for its own good, in an obvious attempt to bring in the younger audience. It's not the same seeing Conan in this kind of juvenile adventure. The quest that Conan and comrades embark on is also lacking in any truly perilous episodes. It certainly was typical of the kind of low grade stuff that veteran director Richard Fleischer (20000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Narrow Margin) was churning out at this stage in his career. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the muscle bound Cimmerian warrior who is approached by an icy Queen (Sarah Douglas) with an offer accompany a princess named Jehnna (Olivia d'Abo) on a journey she must take according to prophecy. In return, she will restore his great love Valeria to life. Of course, this Queen is played by Douglas, otherwise known as Ursa in two of the Superman movies, so we KNOW that she's going to have a nefarious agenda going on. Conan is accompanied by characters such as Bombaata (basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain, in his only film role), a feisty fighter named Zula (the always striking Grace Jones), a goof ball thief, Malak (Tracey Walter), and the wizard Akiro (Mako, also returning from the first film). On location filming in Mexico helps a great deal, as well as solid work from talents such as production designer Pier Luigi Basile and the legendary Jack Cardiff. The music by Basil Poledouris is also a very worthy component. Carlo Rambaldi created the amusingly designed monster-god Dagoth, and it's highly amusing to note that this creation was played by none other than wrestling star Andre Roussimoff, a.k.a. Andre the Giant. Unfortunately there's no real sense of an epic to this sequel, and while there is violence, it doesn't have a lot of punch to it. The finale when Dagoth comes to life at least isn't a bad one. The acting is either hammy (Mako), adequate, or hilariously stiff (Chamberlain and Jones). Walter, while ordinarily a fine character actor, acts too contemporary and is simply out of place here. All things considered, this viewer can see why some fantasy fans would be less than satisfied with Conan the Destroyer. It's actually not that bad as entertainment, but it's better to take it on its own rather than compare it to Barbarian, as it would always come up short. Five out of 10.

In a way it was a lot more enjoyable with fewer pretensions. I guess it was more so the fantasy angle of its story (magic & sorcery), amusing side-characters (which I can see why some find these ragtag characters led by Tracy Walter irritating) and it seemed to flow much better. However while I found the pacing not to be as stodgy&#x85; it just lacked the episodic adventures with its straight-forward story-telling and obvious plotting. Therefore it felt rushed and in the end doesn't really build up to much. Save from a couple of set-pieces of Conan taking on a wizard or two and then finally a mythical beast. Although gotta love the use of the practical special effects and make-up FX. You know rubber monster designs, smoke effects and blatant, if colourful set-designs. No illusions here. Then there's the carnage, and just like Barbarian, Destroyer doesn't skip out on the blood and gore that Conan's sword unleashes. Arnold Schwarzenegger in his signature role plays Conan like his on cruise control. Mixing combat and humour with very little effort. He was born for the part. The support cast had some names with Mako the other only cast member to return. Wilt Chamberlain, Sarah Douglas, Olivia d'Abo and a very animalistic Grace Jones make up a strong line-up. Clunky, but fun 80s sword and sorcery pulp.Thief's should be hanged.

The cinematography, costumes and settings are a high-point, remaining loyal to Frazetta's incredible illustrations.Gone, unfortunately, is the first film's solid, adult screenplay. Howard's original, Nietzschean Conan is watered-down here, the director deciding to play for laughs (but Conan and his world just is'nt comedic).Like the dialogue, the casting is sometimes hit and miss. Although Grace Jones (as the wild warrioress Zula) has been criticized as over the top, she puts in a solid, believable performance. Sarah Douglas also shines as Queen Taramis, although we don't see enough of her! Arnie is adequate, as is Mako (who reprises his role here as a helpful wizard).The film suffers most from poor special effects (an unforgivable crime for fantasy lovers)! It looks like they spent most of the budget on actors and settings, but even by 1980s standards, the monsters Conan faces were absurd.Lessons were not learned, ending with the debacle of Red Sonja a year later. Arnie admitted that film to be the worst he ever made. Destroyer amounts to harmless entertainment, lacking conviction, but watchable all the same.

The cast isn't perfect, but they all seem to fit the part well. Sarah Douglas, Wilt Chamberlain and Grace Jones all have a good presence. Oh, and of course Arnold. The only one I object to is the sidekick thief Malak, and maybe the wizard. Malak was put in the film to add comic relief, and he's not even funny. He should have met his demise early in the film, like in the opening scene maybe. Akiro shouldn't be there because he was in the first Conan movie, and Destroyer is so different than the first that I don't see why they didn't just use someone else for the wizard.Conan The Destroyer is a good action movie with some humor thrown in. It could have done without the cheesy one liner jokes, which seem to take away when the movie gets serious. The only real humor is when Conan gets drunk, I thought that was hilarious.

But of course, nothing is as it seems.One thing I gotta hand to this sequel; it doesn't take itself as seriously as its predecessor.  In fact, this could be seen as a precedent for the umpteen sword-and-sorcery epics that can be had for peanuts on TV and in the movies nowadays.  With every swing of the sword and clash of a titan, there is a one-liner, sight gag or humorous outcome.  What more could you want out of a Conan movie than that?Schwarzenegger is the center of the action, and a solid center he is.  He's always been kind of self-deprecating and he still is here. And being surrounded by a fine ensemble like this doesn't hurt, either.Mako returns as a wizard who can either light a torch or throw a mean spell when he has to, Chamberlain and Jones both flex muscle fiercely and get down and dirty with the fight scenes, Walter adds to his oddball roles as the jewel-swallowing pickpocket Malak, D'abo is slight but well-used as the princess in question and Douglas plays her role as queen much like she did Ursa in Superman II.And for as many fight scenes as there are (and there's a lot), there are also a plethora of humorous scenes - enough to make this one a solid rent alongside the original Conan (or even The Sword and the Sorcerer, another pretender to the throne of Conan, with a few laughs all its own).Eight stars and two swords up for this Destroyer of the competition.

The actions scenes are hilarious and you know it's a problem when someone getting decapitated provokes laughter. Each head that gets lopped off and each sword in the gut seem so cartoonish plus you have to deal with the third rate acting. Sarah Douglas and Olivia D'Aba are both wooden and Wilt Chamberlain(RIP) and Grace Jones both seem out of place in this picture. Arnold is his usual self so don't expect much.

Also, Tracey Walter wipes out the movie as the worst side kick in the history of movies. When I saw this in the theater, people were making loud obscene remarks to the screen whenever he was talking. Yes, as an Arnie fan, I own the movie but, as a movie reviewer, it is my duty to warn you what you are in for if you choose to watch this. It actually has a WWE moment where the wizard body slams Conan and uses the most hilarious move in wrestling, the airplane spin, I S#@$ you not. People were laughing loudly and some got up and left all through the movie. It killed the series because it tried to make a family film out of a very gory but good original movie. Milius' original featured some of the most graphic violence ever seen up to that time with cannibalism and half nude hot babe sacrifices. Here, the tone is much more of a send up of the series. Walters is making very unfunny quips all through the action; yes, Chamberlain was physically awesome to behold but he was a dreadful actor. Don't believe me? Find me another movie he starred in besides this one? Grace Jones is always a treat, here she has some great one liners like her dating technique,Grab him and take him. The battles feature just dreadful facial expressions by Arnie and Grace, bugging their eyes out and making what Fleischer thought were 'war faces.' No, Richard, they are dumb ass dorky looking faces that triggered non-stop giggling in the audience I saw this with. There even is a purely parody scene with the wizards dueling it out with door open / door closed complete with elevator noises. If you enjoyed Flash Gordon and Buckaroo Banzai, you may actually enjoy this movie. I own it but it took me decades to get used to it. When it was released, it closed within two weeks. Everyone expected the original and did not like either the comedy or the campiness. Arnie does a good job, except for the facial expressions, I enjoyed Grace but Walter / D' Abo and Chamberlain are awful. Sarah Douglas, while quite stunning, was always a shaky actress. She has but a few scenes at the beginning and the ending but she is like a redwood wooden. The other point of attack is the finale with Dagoth which has not aged well. Again, Dagoth grabs Conan's arms in the old make a wish hold that provoked more giggling in the cinema. Yes, the movie is bad but imagine how much better it would have been without Walter who prattles on interminably? He faced universal critical attack for his non-stop unfunny humor and stupid acts like stabbing Dagoth after it was already dead. The best way to review this for you is to warn that it is entirely alien to the original. Those who hate parodies or campy movies will loathe this sequel. The humor is throughout the entire movie even during the climactic battle. There are a few funny lines that work but most fall flat. The sword fights tend to be over the top with constant bug eyed facial expressions or people flying through the air thrown by Conan or Chamberlain. I learned to tune Walter out, enjoy the campiness and appreciate it for what it is. I am in the minority believe me; the majority of the fans of Barbarian or the books just detested this movie. If you are as big an Arnie fan, as I am, all of this won't matter a bit to you. He has some good lines with that deadpan delivery that was his trademark. I love,Enough talk, yes, he really wasn't much of a conversationalist. Summary As a pure dramatic sequel to Barbarian, one of the worst sequels only surpassed by Jewel Of The Nile. As campy, light distraction laughing at itself often, it will grow on you. Be warned, I am one of a handful that liked this movie. The theater started emptying almost immediately, by the end, four other people out of a hundred were left. Take It For What It Is. Q.E.D.

This is actually the third Arnold Schwarzenegger film I watched as a child. After seeing this film on VHS in the 90's I wished to see Conan the Barbarian so badly with Arnold in it. Finally it was on TV and I have enjoyed the first film the same as I did the sequel. This film is very underrated but it is still good. Million ways better than the remake Conan the Barbarian (2011) and Red Sonja (1985) they ruined the original film with that remake. Sorry I never liked Red Sonja or the remake to the original and a sequel film. Why hate this film, when it's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Why remaking the film if we already had the original film?! Pointless! The film is also pretty brutal in places, it is violent, and somewhat bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters,so don't be too mislead by the PG rating. The PG rating doesn't harm the tone of the film much, it's still relatively bloody, but apparently Richard Fleischer shot it as a hard R before the producers cut it down. Conan (beautiful and charismatic Arnold Schwarzenegger) going on a mission for evil Queen Taramis (Sarah Douglas). He must retrieve a gemstone which unlocks another treasure called the Horn of Dagoth. A treasure that will bring to life an Evil God.

That's your basic plot. It does involve sword fights and sorcery including mythology, like the evil god that they put the horn on him and try to kill Jenna. Conan chopping the heads off, they didn't show everything but we see flying heads when Conan chops them off. Conan fighting with Wizard Thoth-Amon/Monster in the chamber of mirrors was epic, the battle was awesome. I Love that Conan kills Bombaata on the end of the film for betraying him, saves Jenna and battle Dagoth creature played by WCW wrestler (Andr√© the Giant). Conan fighting off Queen Taramis's guards in the opening scene was just spectacular, bloody and very violent. That's what I just love in this film. After watching it this Saturday I have enjoyed every moment and had fun with it. This film has a cracking soundtrack score to it. And an awesome score soundtrack, the ambush scene by the horse soldiers and the fight underground after stealing the horn. Basil Poledouris' music is the one part of the film that is totally up to scratch. It's not as heavy as his score to the first film but he does introduce new, stronger themes and lighter takes on cues from the first. Brilliant stuff. Conan the Destroyer is a 1984 American sword and sorcery/adventure film directed by Richard Fleischer, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mako Iwamatsu reprising their roles as Conan and Akiro the wizard, respectively.

Another reviewer called it total crap. Maybe, but it's fun crap. Personally. I liked this movie more than the original Conan The Barbarian, which took itself more seriously. Aside from Arnold Schwarzenegger playing our hero Conan, it is full of fascinating characters. Sarah Douglas as the evil Queen Taramis is an absolute hoot & so too is Grace Jones playing Zula a gritty female warrior. Far less interesting is Olivia D'Abo as Princess Jehnna who seems miscast &, quite frankly, a poor actress. The gruff-voiced actor Mako, a Japanese who emigrated to the USA, plays one of Conan's friends a powerful wizard named Akiro. He also gets irritating after a while. The film's story, to try & pare it down, is that Queen Taramis enlists the help of Conan to find the horn of an evil god Dagoth. The horn will enable Queen Taramis to rule the world, she believes. The virginal Princess Jehnna has to be sacrificed as a part of the deal & the evil queen's agent Bombaata (Wilt Chamberlain) accompanies them in their quest. He has been sent as guardian to the princess, to ensure that the princess remains a virgin & to spy for his queen. At any moment Bombaata could turn against Conan & try to kill him. Along the way they encounter Zula who joins the team after Conan saves her from being executed. Some of the sets made for this movie are both imaginative & very creative. It is campy, certainly, but it also generally a lot of fun. The IMDb user-rating of 5.8 is, in my opinion, far too low. I would score it a minimum of 8.

The film aims for more comedy, slapstick and visual buffoonery over blood n violence, nothing wrong with this I guess but for me its a thumbs down. The first film was more adult and gave the film a grittier nastier feel, this just feels like a kids adventure at times. Even with Basil Poledouris booming musical score (first films sounded like 'Total Recall', this sounds like its been extracted from 'Robocop') it doesn't make much difference.I must admit to enjoying these films much more when I was but a mere sprogling. The fact its Arnie in the main role as Conan saves the film from doom in my opinion as there isn't too much more on offer. There isn't much action of note, not much blood, set pieces are drab and the adventure a bit dull, the only thing to lift you is the nice monster sequence at the end (head looks a bit like the Brundlefly creature from the Cronenberg film). That and Sarah Douglas being all sexy n evil (oh my Queen!), for me these films haven't aged so well and I still prefer 'The Beastmaster'.4/10 "},{"Title":"I prefer a Barbarian over a Destroyer","Date":"23 September 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" Mildly entertaining but ultimately underwhelming successor to the superior Conan the Barbarian (1982). The strong but silent warrior returns to the big screen as he is tasked by a ruthless queen to escort her young and beautiful niece to a faraway magic castle to find a jewel that can awaken the sleeping god, Dagoth, she worships. Together with a ragtag band of fellow warriors, Conan fights marauders, sorcery and demons along the way, while the princess falls in love with him. Little do both know she is destined to be a human sacrifice to the monstrous god, and there are those in the warriors' ranks who must ensure the girl will fulfill that destiny, even if it means killing Conan in the process. Though there's more intrigue in the story compared to its predecessor, it often gets in the way of the plan simple action people will expect from this film, while a PG rating, ill suited to the material (Barbarian was rated R after all), further restricts the fighting to such an extent it never gets beyond childish and mediocre. The effects are also not on par with the first film, though they still make for a decent dreamy level of quality that contributes to the overall sense of fantasy. Noted science fiction and fantasy director Richard Fleischer (20000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), Fantastic Voyage (1966), Soylent Green (1973)) has been known to produce better fare than this, though it remains an interesting entry in his oeuvre. A third movie, which could have undone the flaws of this film, unfortunately never got beyond the planning stages of production. In order to still get his dose of fantasy acting, Schwarzenegger opted for a supporting role in the suspiciously similar Red Sonja the following year, ironically enough also directed by Fleischer.

What I considered a shame though was that the filmmakers never actually went on to make a third movie where Conan becomes king. I am not familiar with the original Conan stories, having never read one, but I suspect that the filmmakers did refer to the books when making these films, and I suspect that the books also chronicle on Conan becoming a king, though as I said, I have not read any of the books so I cannot comment.While not having the same epic quality that the original film has, I still enjoy this film. Rather than having the scope of the first film, where much of the film is narrated as we follow Conan in his desire to revenge the murder of his village, this film really only deals with a single adventure that Conan has after defeating the snake cult (though the only reference to the previous film is to Conan's beloved, and this is played out by the antagonist who promises to bring Conan's beloved back to life in return for his services).The interesting thing is that the more recent Conan movie seems to have elements of both of these films in it, namely with regards to the woman that Conan protects. In this film the woman is a young noble who will be sacrificed to allow a god to return to Hyboria. In the later movie she was to be a conduit through which the antagonist could resurrect his dead wife. However, as mentioned a few times, the newer movie pales in comparison to the original ones. In this one they must go on a quest to retrieve some objects, however the girl is meant to remain a virgin (something that is excluded from the later movie). This would have been a problem, except that Conan's heart belongs to somebody else, and this somebody else is dead, so we notice that Conan is constantly rebuffing the girl's advances.I do enjoy this film, and would watch it again, particularly since I like the wizard. In the first movie he only carries the name wizard, but here we learn that he does have a name, Akiro. I would have preferred it if he had simply retained the title 'the Wizard' since it would have added a lot more mystery to the character, but this film, as mentioned a few times, is not the original film, and simply seems to be an excuse to cash in on the limited success of the original.

I guess I've seen so many better films by now that it just doesn't cut the mustard like it did back then. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please wait outside the fortress and guard the horses).Conan is grieving for his lost Valeria (from the first movie) and, when he's offered a chance to bring her back from the dead, he jumps at it. Queen Taramis needs him, by now a skilled warrior, to take Princess Jehnna, who has been gifted with special sight and her bodyguard, Bombaata, on a mission to retrieve a magic crystal from an enchanted fortress. He also takes Zula (a skilled fighter), Akiro (The Wizard) and Malak (a thief). This mission proves very perilous and Conan has enemies all around him. I don't want to say any more, just on the off chance I might give too much away.Although this film had a bigger budget than the first one, I think it fails to hit the mark by quite a long way. The script is terrible and some of the effects look very dated by today's standards. Although nobody stood out, performance-wise, I will give honourable mentions to; Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, Grace Jones as Zula, Wilt Chamberlain as Bombaata, Mako as Akiro, Tracey Walter as Malak, Sarah Douglas as Queen Taramis and Olivia d'Abo as Princess Jehnna.I guess all fantasy adventure films will be weighed against the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy and older films, like this, are never going to come out well. It's clear that the filmmakers put most of the money into the effects and forgot about the script, unfortunately. It's a shame because the first Conan film, Conan the Barbarian (1982), and the subsequent one, Red Sonja (1985), were so much better. I just hope the new Conan film, out later this year, doesn't fall into the same trap.

After this disappointment, it's not a surprise that Arnold didn't do many sequels to his films. The awe and wonder are nowhere to be found in this film. It feels very manufactured and contrived. The storyline is very uninteresting and there isn't much violence. They re-cut it to have a P.G rating, but that backfired. I missed the emotion and the spectacle that made the original so good. The acting isn't very impressive. Arnold tries, but he can't overcome the crappy material. He'll always be Conan to me and I hope the new one he's making will make up for this movie. Grace Jones had a moment in the sun during the 80's for some odd reason. She's just weird and not in a good way. Wilt Chamberlain should have stuck to his day job. Mako reprises his role from the original, not much more to it. Olivia d'Abo is cute, but doesn't offer much of anything else. Sarah Douglas makes a bland villain.

Tamer sequels do not necessarily have to be bad films, but they usually seem incredibly dull compared to their predecessors. This was the case when the Australian cult-classic Mad Max (1979) and its even superior sequel Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior (1981) were followed by the tame and vastly inferior third part Beyond Thunderdome (1985), and it is also the case with Conan. While Conan The Barbarian of 1982 is an absolute classic of the early 80s which stands out as THE all-time highlight in the Sword & Sorcery genre, this Conan The Destroyer of 1984 was obviously intended to cash in on a wider audience - which makes it a lot less interesting. The film cuts back on violence and nudity, as well as the generally archaic and menacing mood of the predecessor, and introduces annoying and unnecessarily 'funny' characters. As in Conan The Barbarian, the films starts with Mako voice speaking a little prologue (Between the Time When The Oceans Drank Atlantis,...), but it also sounds a lot less imposing this time. What really lowers the quality of the 'Conan' franchise in this sequel, however, is the lack of a charismatic villain. The mysterious and diabolical Thulsa Doom, the cult that followed him and the mythology behind it all, as well as James Earl Jones' brilliant performance in the role were arguably the most memorable aspects about the original. The sequel lacks a villain that could even nearly compare to the greatness of Thulsa Doom. While no comparable villain could be expected, the lack of a true menace still reduces the film's entertainment value immensely. Assigned by a Queen with magic powers, Conan and his companions have to escort an arrogant teenage princess (Olicia d'Abo) this time, which is, of course, a lot less promising a premise than that of the first film. Nonetheless, it would be wrong to state that Conan The Destroyer has no qualities whatsoever. The settings are still very cool (even if not AS cool). Arnold Schwarzenegger still fits in his role, even though Conan has become a little 'nicer', which I find quite annoying. Also, Grace Jones is not exactly my dream woman, but she fits in her role extremely well, and is probably the best reason to watch this flick. The late Mako also comes back in his role of the Wizard and Narrator. Unlike its predecessor, which was filmed in the Spanish Alm√©ria (the splendid location where many brilliant Italian Westerns were filmed during the 60s and 70s), Conan The Destroyer was filmed in Juarez, Mexico. The locations are still very nice (even though not as great as in the first), and the camera work is very well done. The musical score is also quite the same as in the first one, even though it seems as if composer Basil Poledouris put a little less effort in this time. The film has its qualities, but the main thought one will have while watching it is still that it is just so vastly inferior compared to the original. This is especially disappointing, regarding that director Richard Fleischer is also responsible for several very good films, such as 10 Rillington Place, Mr. Majestyk or Mandingo. Overall Conan The Destroyer is acceptably entertaining, but compared to its great predecessor, it is just cheesy and solely commercial nonsense. Stick with the original instead!

In return for the girl's safety and the horn, Queen Taramis claims that she will be able to bring Conan's lost love Valeria back to life. Conan accepts, not knowing that the queen has no intention of keeping her part of the bargain, and that she really plans to sacrifice the princess and harness the magic of the horn for her own destructive purposes. Conan sets out with Bombatta, her bodyguard and his Malak, a thief. They meet old friend Akiro and a warrior woman Zula, and together take on the quest. It will not be easy as Bombatta is a traitor, and there are many enemies in their way.An inferior script and direction lets this film down in the shadow of its predecessor. There is too much comedy here, and Conan becomes more sociable rather than the tortured Barbarian he really is. He was meant to rule forever with Valeria, but she was taken he should have become more of a recluse rather than making unlikely friends- he spent the majority of his life imprisoned or as a slave. However, this is the way the story goes, and while Grace Jones, Olivia D'Abo, Chamberlain and Mako are good, the rest of the cast is annoying. Everything looks cheap, without the style of the first film helped by James Earl Jones, Max Von Sydow and Gerry Lopez. There is little emotional content compared to the first film which decreases the quality. Some of the effects are awful even for the time, and much of the dialogue is cheesy. However, there are a few funny moments, the famous, repeatedly cut 'camel punch', and the music is very good. Arnie gets lots more to say but the impact is not as great as in COB. The action is pretty good though, and that is where Arnie is the King. It could have been a very good sequel, but suffers as a cheap cash-in with no real thought or emotion put in, perhaps due to the rushed schedule.6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"A not so serious sequel...","Date":"22 February 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" This is a not so serious sequel to Conan the Barbarian. It definitely is a different type of film, which seems to be not as well liked as the ...Barbarian.I saw this movie first in the theaters, in the 80s. As a child, I liked it and many years later I still watch it occasionally enjoying it thoroughly.Conan is charged with guiding a small band to retrieve special jewels to bring back to life a god. In doing so, he is to be rewarded his ultimate desire, to have his Valeria brought back from the dead (watch ....Barbarian for that story).Things happen along the way, and we get to be part of the journey but spared the most boring parts. Mako makes a return in the sequel, playing the wizard role again. The quest involves a lot of action along the way, fighting, killing, betrayal. We're treated with an array of good special effects, that aren't totally realistic but can definitely be appreciated.The young (I think she was 15) Olivia D'abo is just so beautiful in this film, she holds the attention of the film on several occasions. She really does a nice job in what I think is her debut big screen role, playing the princess to perfection.This film like Barbarian, featured a great cast of interesting figures. While not necessarily movie stars, Wilt the Stilt Chamberlin and Grace Jones co-star and more contribute to this fun movie.One of the things I enjoy is the apparently way over acting of Chamberlin, requiring his lines to be dubbed after shooting. You'll also notice most of his lines are off camera. But that's OK, the massive Bombaata can do his lines however he wants! The ending is OK, featuring Andre the Giant in the Dagoth costume. The real final battle is that between Bombaata and Conan. Still the Dagoth scenes are done OK, and I've got to admit after Dagoth is slain I still find the oozing scene a bit disturbing! While this movies story is a bit lighter than Barbarian, the film is still well done and has a lot of attention to detail.I'm happy with the results, I'm just a little disappointed that a 3rd movie never came to be.6/10 "},{"Title":"Not too bad, judge it for what it is.","Date":"24 January 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" I had not seen Conan the Destroyer since I was a teen and looking back now having just watched both films, this one is not that bad if you look at it for what it is.Conan the Barbarian really is a classic. It is unpretentious, raw, and mythic. I didn't enjoy it when I saw it as a child. It is an adult's film. Conan the Destroyer was made for a younger crowd - children to college age. Despite the PG rating, it does have plenty of rolling heads and blood, though to satisfy the adult audience. The difference in this film is that there is an emphasis on humor and the characters are not as interesting. It IS a weaker film, but it still is a good film.Uncompared, as every film should be viewed, this is a nice little fantasy. The scenes with the evil wizard in the ice palace are wonderfully mythical and the sword-fighting is just barbaric and true to the Conan character. The musical score by the returning Basil Poledouris is excellent too. It really adds to the credibility of the film. Schwarzenegger is good here too. He seems to be having fun and he definitely is a perfect Conan. Just as good is the return of Mako as Akiro the Wizard. He is definitely Conan's best ally and he turns in a much better performance than the rest of his team. Chamberlain is good enough and it was smart that he doesn't have too much dialogue. He gets to look imposing. Sarah Douglas is terrific as the sexy evil queen and the only shame in her character is that we do not see more of her. She has a certain dignity and mystical quality that a beautiful evil villainess should have.What doesn't work as well in the film is the acting of the supporting cast, less the people just mentioned. Most of all, it is weakly directed, though. There just doesn't seem to be a driving force in this film. It feels as if wanders along. It would be more interesting to see what makes the princess choose the course that they take. The film lacks purpose.Overall, though, this film entertains and is still a worthy sequel to Barbarian. It rates about 3 points less though, almost solely based on the directing strength that John Milius gave the first film. He is what is sorely missed in this one.

Fairly true to author and Conan creater Robert E. Howard's vision, the first Conan was entertaining and successful. Schwarzenegger was perfectly cast as the protagonist. Born and raised in the barbarian northern land of Cimmeria, Conan of the novels (originally published in serial form during the thirties) spoke the various languages of his world with, as Howard described, a 'gutteral accent', and Arnie's Austrian articulations fit the bill to a tee. In the first film a sort of plausible reason for his huge muscles is offered (fifteen years give or take as the last survivor of his people, every day pushing a huge wheel that runs a mill of some sort), and he goes forth as a formidable adult, on his quest to avenge the slaughter of his people, with some carousing thrown in along the way. The first flick entertains and has a satisfying conclusion. I was looking forward to perhaps seeing the continuing story of Conan's life chronicalled on film as this beginning promised in its final storyboard, even perhaps to Arnold portraying Conan as a 60+ year old still-strong warrior king the way the books tell of, in Arnold's own advancing age. (well, I can dream..)Then this thing came along. 'Conan the Destroyer'. What in high heaven was the studio thinking? This production is garbage. The story? A remarkably motley group of misfits heads across the land on some lame quest, looking like one of those Disney Incredible Journey movies where an odd assortment of pets crosses the country looking for their owners. Other than Schwarzenegger the casting stank. Wilt Chamberlain just looks weird and gangly beside the much shorter and more heavily muscled Arnold (actually 6'2 himself!) and succeeds in making the Oak look like a strange lumpy dwarf in most scenes where they are seen together. Olivia D'abo as the princess seems to have few things to say except for screeching Bombaataa! every few minutes. The cowardly thief is a dislikeable gimmick and Grace Jones is such a bug eyed screaming train wreck you just want her character to be killed as soon as possible. Regrettably that doesn't happen.

It also seems like Schwarzenegger has learned some skill with the sword, which he most unmotivated shows off in the middle of a fight or two. But even if these small improvements is there, I did like the first one better, because this just feels like the same thing all over again.

It's not that it's bad or such a pale kid-friendly followup to its CLASSIC original, but CtD is just clunky and boring.The biggest problem is that Conan is given way too many sidekicks. It seems every significant scene in the first half of the movie only exists to either set up the plot (which is rather thin and lacking), introduce another sidekick to add to the party, or provide for weak comedy relief! There is absolutely no character building, precious little intrigue, no suspense, and even less excitement. Once the second half comes and we near act 3, the film feels so on autopilot that it's impossible to pay attention to.Richard Fleischer was one of the top action directors from the 50's-70's, but by the mid-80's he had unfortunately been reduced to hired hand status and often given family-friendly dreck he seemed to have precious little investment in. This film is pedestrian and uninventive in every way, especially disappointing considering the crew involved. Jack Cardiff's photography is workmanlike, Giannetto De Rossi's makeup rubs off in a few scenes, and Basil Poledouris's score is just a weaker version of his career highpoint score for CtB. Even Carlo Rambaldi's malevolent demigod creature creation is lacking and not very scary at all thanks to poor movement control and the fact that you never see the entire monster in any one shot. It suffers an acute case of Krakenitis (in reference to CLASH OF THE TITANS) in that it's the climactic cataclysmic monster but upon introduction it just stands around and doesn't do anything! About the only saving grace is the completely wacky cast - with Arnold teamed up with Wilt Chamberlain (in a completely forgettable and pointless role), Grace Jones (as an angry Zulu warrior), Mako (looking half-asleep), Jeff Corey, Sarah Douglas (attractive as usual), Pat Roach (in a rare speaking role), and Sven-Ole Thorson. Thorson's character is given a curiously detailed and important-feeling fight scene with Arnold even though he is just a random low-level nameless villain whose face is never clearly shown. Arnold doesn't seem to care at all that he looks just like one of the villains he killed in the last movie. Perhaps he's meant to be his twin brother? This could have been interesting if the film had done anything with it.That unfortunately applies to everything else in this film - a lot of missed potential in favor of a cynical attempt to make as much cash as possible with as little style or originality as possible.

Howard‚Äôs source material than the more realistic first film (which perhaps drew more on the famously stark illustrations of Frank Frazetta for its look).Anyway, while this emerged a somewhat more engaging adventure than RED SONJA (1985), the plot of both films is strikingly similar ‚Äì in that the mission in each involves a girl in peril (here, however, she‚Äôs an innocent rather than a warrior) helped by he-man Arnold Schwarzenegger to fight an evil queen/sorceress and her legions ‚Äì even if the obligatory comic relief is perhaps even less welcome this time around (via Conan‚Äôs diminutive and cowardly sidekick Tracey Walter)! The action highlights are also more elaborate (though they‚Äôre far from the stylized ones featured in the 1982 CONAN THE BARBARIAN ‚Äì and, consequently, less impressive) these include the oft-seen trick involving a wizard defeated by shattering his multiple reflection in a hall of mirrors, and the climax where Conan (with the dubious help of Walter) battle a Toho-style monster(!) called Dagoth.Despite employing director Fleischer and legendary cinematographer Jack Cardiff (both of whom had worked on THE VIKINGS 1958, one of the most impressive ‚Äì and evocative ‚Äì epics from the genre‚Äôs heyday), the film can hardly be compared to that magnificent achievement. For starters, Schwarzenegger‚Äôs Conan comes off rather buffoonish at times, especially during a drunken reverie in which he stumbles clumsily into rockfaces and in an unintentionally hilarious shot when villainess Sarah Douglas asks Conan to think and we cut to a close-up of wide-eyed Arnie! The cast is made up of veteran character actors (Mako, Jeff Corey and Ferdy Mayne) and supporting newcomers (Grace Jones, Olivia D‚ÄôAbo, Wilt Chamberlain) and Basil Poledouris once again provides stirring musical accompaniment. Although I revisited the film via the UK R2 DVD, unfortunately it was the original, bare-bones and slightly censored disc rather than any of the two subsequent SE DVDs which include Audio Commentaries with Fleischer, Douglas, D‚ÄôAbo and Walter!

Schwarzenegger's Conan is here wasted on a trivial adventure which resembles the Conan comics more than Robert E. Howard's original stories, with none of the latter's imaginative pulp poetry. The Sword and the Sorcerer, a prominent low-grade Conan cash-in, is a more satisfying Saturday Matin√©e than this. There is more so-called magic in this fantasy than in the first Conan film, but the rubber monsters make it play like a charmless remake of Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger without the wonderful effects artistry. The script, an appalling come-down for writer Stanley Mann, is cursed with unfunny comedy and relentlessly dumb dialogue which make the dubbed Italian Maciste pepla epics of yore seem bright by comparison.Big Arnold, then just cutting his teeth as a professional actor, is given no opportunity to develop his one-dimensional character, yet commands attention whenever he is front-and-center. The film only comes to life during the fight sequences, which really deliver the goods. A thrilling sword-fight between Conan and one of the Queen's guards is a major highlight.Otherwise the production's most interesting aspect is the colorful supporting cast, notably scene-stealer Grace Jones, as a ferocious, butt-kicking warrior, and ultra-cool Sarah Douglas (Superman II), in outrageous leather-bondage garb as an Evil Queen. Mako returns as the Dune Wizard, but sports giant Wilt Chamberlain is not allowed to make much of an impression, apart from a display of grunting machismo. Ferdy Mayne (Count Von Krolock of Roman Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers) makes an appearance as a wicked sorcerer. There is also the novelty of two future Bond women (D'Abo of The Living Daylights and Jones of A View to a Kill) in leading roles. The movie's nadir is the foolish inclusion of a pipsqueak comic sidekick (Tracey Walter), so annoying that the real Conan would have eaten him for breakfast -- raw.Instead of making improvements for a third entry in the initially promising Conan series, De Laurentiis squandered Schwarzenegger in an unwanted travesty of Howard's Red Sonja (1985), killing off hopes for further adaptations of the author's work. Recent plans by Schwarzenegger to atone by reviving the character seem to have been ... Terminated.

Instead of Conan being a king, we find him being a scavenging thief, with an annoying wise-cracking side-kick Malak. They both get involved with some plot with an evil queen who sends them on a quest, with a young virgin no less, to retrieve a special key, which in turn unlocks a horn (or something).As previously stated - this movie seems to completely ignore what made the first movie soooo great. Conan in the original film was a complete thud with no brains - and no dialect either. However - fast forward to Destroyer and his vocabulary seems to have increased at an exponential rate - so instead of being a complete brut - he know sounds like a semi-educated security guard.The first movie was a serious one - full of glorious music, emotion and blood and guts. However - it feels like they have tried to completely tone down all the violence and adult themes in order to achieve a lower PG rating to get the kiddies in to watch the film. Also - half of Arnies punches and sword swipes don't seem to connect (take the first battle - whereby a punch thrown by Arnie into thin air knocks down a horse and solider!).I'm a big fan of Grace Jones - but she doesn't seem to do her acting career any favours by having an acting range of angry to angrier. Her role in this (despite being second billed) is very minor and completely incidental to the plot line.I think they had some serious casting problems with this movie - they seem to have casted a poor-man's version of Debbie Gibson who can't seem to act. Also - they make her out to be sexy - but she doesn't even look legal! I'm glad she picked up a couple of Razzies for worst supporting actor that year! And that sidekick - he is just soooo overacted (but then again - the script doesn't really do anything for him in his favour - with dialogue like A fine magician you are! Go back to juggling apples.).The special effects are cheesy and rather embarrassing. Conan fights with two creatures, both of which look like a David Cronenburg rejects. The whole wizard power thing was totally lame. Mako basically waves his hands around, sounds constipated and can determine where missing virgins are or raise locked doors.Overall - I like cheesy movies, but this just doesn't even cut it on a cheesy movie factor. Probably adding to my hatred of this movie - is the fact that this sequel cheapens the first! This is D Grade the whole way.

Along for the ride is Mako's wizard, the late Wilt Chamberlain's bodyguard Bombatta, evil eye Grace Jones as killer Amazon Zula, and Tracy Walter as bumbling sidekick Malak.More of a comedy or spoof of the genre, lacking much of the drama that elevated the first film above being just another costume epic. Arnold is fun to watch - though he should have kept his shirt and pants on -as you can see him developing his Arnold persona with more of the charm and humor that characterized his outings in films like Commando, Predator and The Running Man; he even shows more knack for drama as he delivers lines such as What I want, you cannot give me. and Life for Valeria. Wilt Chamberlain plays his part well enough, Jones is fierce looking, Mako is dignified, Oliva D'Abo is cute and Walter has his moments though he really doesn't belong in this movie (Robert E. Howard's Conan would never have taken such a cowardly fool under his wing, and you can see Conan himself shake his head at Malak). Action pieces are executed competently, but there's something sad about watching Arnold get his ass handed to him by the gator ape (the late Pat Roach, may he rest in peace).

Second mistake was, that the writers and producers abandoned the original style of the creator of Conan, Robert E. Howard, and went towards more childish, yet some times entertaining, Marvel comic Conan. Third mistake was the almost complete removal of familiar characters of CTB, only Conan and The Wizard were spared, and replacing them with annoying and non personal paper cuts. The plot goes, that Arnold and his idiot peon, along Zula (Grace Jones) Bombaata (Wilt Chamberlain) and The Wizard (Mako), must rescue a princess Jehhna (Olivia d'Abo) for eeveel queen Aramis, oh sorry Taramis (Sarah Douglas), and bring the Queenie a crystal horn, so she could revive a Horned God. This would have been perfectly fine for a 10 page long Marvel comic. For this movie it's just pain.Also the acting deepens the unbearably of the flick, everyone just over acts poorly or seem totally uninterested in a way or another.This is probably the worst, there's huge battle between this and Red Sonja, movie by Arnold, with very little redeeming aspects. There is however, in the uncut version, couple of close up shot from heads chopped off, so if thats your thing, you might find this some what entertaining.I personally found it to be a appalling experience, tough a honest word here, I liked this when I was 12-years old.

The fact that Arnold could neither act or speak for the first movie made no difference; it was unimportant.  For the sequel, Conan the Destroyer, Richard Fleischer, the director, threw away all the points that made the first good; the minimalist dialogue and any vestige of an intelligent plot.But Arnold movies don't need plot.  They have muscles.Arnold delivers spectacularly in the muscle department.  The violence in this movie, the selling point in every action movie, is unrelenting and vicious.  As Arnold spins into action, limbs fly.  Literally.  The sword fights contain none of the martial arts finesse Hollywood insists on putting into newer action films; rather, they are explosively violent and vicious in an untamed, unfinessed battle of strength against strength.  It's no wonder that when the credits start rolling, the first name to come up is the stunt coordinator; he had the most important job.Other than that, the movie is lackluster.  The effects are impressive, for 1984; the monsters are more believable than most.  The characters are throwaway caricatures, with no life in any of them.  The sets are flat and cartoony, resembling something out of a movie twice this one's age.  Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlin are wasted in empty roles, roles that any stuntman could have filled.The movie tries to move in a lighter direction, but the jokes fall flat. The running joke about the thief of the group being a coward, greedy, and whiny simply makes him unlikable.One highlight that makes the movie almost worth watching is the scene where a drunk Arnold tries to teach Olivia d'Abo (Princess Jehnna) to use a sword. He shows some of the comic flair that came to life later in such movies as Twins and True Lies.  `I suppose nothing hurts you;' she notes.  `Only pain,' he agrees.Conan provides a brief adrenaline rush, and an occasional laugh, but if your choice for a weekends entertainment lies between seeing Conan the Destroyer and beating yourself on the head with a hammer.pick the hammer.

The completed first installment was about strength, the projected second and third installments would be about honor and responsibility in turn.  Well, something must have gone wrong between Milius and producers De Laurentis and Pressman because Conan the Destroyer bears about as much similarity to the first film as a Big Mac does to a fine medium rare steak. Milius' measured and stately direction, minimalist dialogue and Nietzschean philosophizing are gone to be replaced with a hackneyed script bursting with cliches, and silly characters. Conan himself is reworked as a bumbling drunken oaf as opposed to the Aryan ubermensch of the first movie. Conan the Destroyer is less interesting than a comic strip, what on earth possessed the makers of the series to perform such an about-face? Who knows, but it was a massive mistake.

Still, this is one of Arnold's lesser endeavors, when he was still finding his feet as a star & hoped for no more than laughs & loot. Brawny barbarian thief & hackmeister Conan is recruited by sinister, leggy witch-queen Taramis (Douglas) to help her leggier, good-witch niece Jehna (D'Abo, in her first film) steal a distant, well-guarded bauble necessary for their thaumaturgical ambitions. Jehna brings her bodyguard Bombaata (Chamberlain, in his only film) and Conan his sidekick Malak (Walter) and wizard-buddy Akiro (Mako), the only other character returning from Conan the Barbarian. On their travels they rescue punk-Rasta Amazon Zula (Jones, leggiest & toughest of anyone) from an interactive lynch mob. You'll be stunned to learn that there's more to this adventure than Conan was told (if you can't trust a sexy witch-queen, what's this fantasy world coming to?). Conan 2 makes several valiant attempts at humor & campiness. The actors are game but with varying results. Walter steals every scene as the dagger-wielding thief who's utterly selfish except for his loyalty to his big buddy & even that has limits. Fine character actors Corey (Butch Cassidy), Mayne (Where Eagles Dare)& Mako don't have enough to work with here, although Mayne gets to say, as few actors can, that he actually blew smoke out of his ears. The lissome D'Abo in costumes made with a threshing machine is very watchable until the last big action hoopla, where she cowers and screams annoyingly for several minutes. Let's be fair, though could Julia Roberts have done any better with that material? Chamberlain, fresh from hucking the VW Rabbit to a credulous America (it had more headroom than his Rolls-Royce, remember?) makes a finely taciturn lunkhead. Wilt illustrates why Schwarzenegger succeeded where Dick Butkus before & Shaquille O'Neal afterward failed. Arnold's lively, artless and infectious joy at getting paid for Let's Pretend really has no equal in the entertainment industry. Not for several more years did he start taking himself as seriously as his rival Stallone, at which point the fun ended. The worst part about this film is that it has a story worthy of much better treatment, a classic fantasy adventure rather than the gloomy, introspective revenge tale that Oliver Stone & John Milius put on in the first film. Robert Howard, one of the best short-story writers ever, might have made much of Taramis's attempts to seduce Conan & the hero's struggle to resist her enough to remain true to Howard's Barbarian Code of Honor--and done it in a few pages. Of course, all that would have taken a lot of, you know, like, acting & stuff. The film's effects are a cut above average until the last scene, where they become as ludicrous as any ever filmed. Basil Poledouris's magnificent music, the best feature of Conan 1 & among the best ever written for the screen, is wisely recycled into Conan 2. This film isn't romantic enough for a date movie except with the least discerning (that is, the most hammered) of girlfriends, and is too '80s androgynous to watch with the guys (Oh, no! What if Boy George had been offered a part?!). Conan the Destroyer is a guilty pleasure best watched alone.

Not here--in fact the makers dispensed with everything that was good about the first Conan movie (when he was still just a Barbarian), and made some disastrous decisions to boot. The major mistake was dropping the rating from R to PG. Another huge mistake was failing to get John Milius to direct the project. Then there were the decisions about virtually everything else--the writing was abysmal, the villains were silly, and the humor was entirely out of place and unfunny. I needed some relief from the comic relief. Wilt Chamberlain was a bad idea, it's not that the guy can't act, which of course he can't, it's just that he's not all that menacing and seems uncomfortable in all the scenes he's in. Grace Jones is more than irritating, she's unwatchable. Robert Howard purists had some problems with the first one, since it didn't closely follow the books, but this is more like the comic books rather than the actual books, a comic book set on film--and not a very good one at that. This was extremely disappointing in that it was such a missed opportunity. Some sequels are serious mistakes since they detract from the original, but Conan is one character that can handle a series of movies--but who'd want to see another if it is as silly and stupid as Destroyer?

Part of this is because it was really very hard to take the film seriously due to the ultra-bizarre casting.

But even more bizarre was the appearance of Grace Jones as,....Grace Jones. I guess it was just an 80s thing--but WHAT WAS THE APPEAL OF MS. JONES?! Her music, to put it mildly, was crappy and mind-numbing but her acting was far worse! She made up for her limited acting range by mostly shrieking and killing things!

The first Conan, while somewhat rough and incoherent in spots, managed to incorporate much of what Robert E. Howard's best known creation so interesting and appealing. The director, John Milius, seems to have a special affinity for tales like this, and his crew definitely captured the raw-edged, primal feel of a wilder, mythic time. And then this thing came along. The first sign of trouble, to me, was having the credits include Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway as the writers. Now Thomas and Conway were/are both fine comics writers. In fact, Thomas' adaptations of Howard's works into comics form (along with artist Barry Windsor Smith) were classics and high points of the genre. But the emphasis here is that they wrote COMICS, not movies, and I was afraid they might be conditioned and limited by the conventions of a medium typically followed by male adolescents. I don't know how much of the mediocre mess that followed the movie credits was actually Thomas and Conway's fault, but my fears proved to be justified. The plot, which might have made for a mildly diverting 48 page issue of Savage Sword Of Conan, was far too thin and clich√©d to sustain a feature length movie. The dialog, which might have 'read' well in a word balloon on a comics page, was flat and badly delivered. The acting barely existed. Chamberlain and Jones were barely able to play themselves on camera, let alone act. Walters and D'Abo were completely out of place in this setting. In fact, almost every comic relief line out of Walter's mouth made me want to plug my ears and sing loudly to drown him out. The sets and costumes all looked like something John Buscema (the legendary comic artist who took over 'Conan' when Smith left') might have done if he had burned out and was drawn the whole thing in one morning without a single correction or revision.As for Arnold, he seemed to have both bulked up and polished his physique, so he looked much more like a comic book superhero than in the first film, but it wasn't really an improvement. Instead of looking like a wild-maned barbarian, he came off as something like a viziers' pampered bodyguard/strongman. And while he still could swing and handle a sword convincingly, his acting hadn't improved in the least. But mostly, the story just didn't have any 'heft' to it. Conan and his motley crew ran around, got into scrapes with soldiers, guards, wizards, and monsters, and eventually Conan ended up skewering another beastie in a climactic scene that had all the dramatic impact of a Power Rangers' movie. I have to admit that I saw this on cable again a few months ago, and enjoyed it a lot more the second time around. Maybe it was my diminished expectations, or the fact that I was seeing it for free on the confines of the small screen, but I was able to find a lot more to like about it. That adds a couple more stars to the rating. So IMO, that's the way to see Conan The Destroyer. Don't think of it as a Conan movie. Think of it as Conan Lite, and you'll be okay with it.

While this is the only Fleischer film I've seen, clearly he could direct before, what happened? Was he just *that* unfamiliar with this kind of flick? Arnie returns for more sword and sorcery, and even the most desperate D&D fans probably reject it. Say what you will about the original; I realize that not everyone loves it, and it's neither a masterpiece nor a movie for all audiences. Still, it stays with you, it's entertaining, it's epic and visually, it's *fantastic*. None of that is true for this. Oh, the FX has moments; among the poor instances of them are 2D animation(come on, what's wrong with clay, or stop-motion, it's not a cartoon) and obvious green-screen shots(guys, you might wanna consider getting some footage to inter-cut those with, they help make it convincing). Well, the sets are nice; they came with the bigger budget. However, the editing and cinematography are extremely unimpressive. This features a basketball(I think) player, and he's quite tall; so why does this barely take advantage of that at all? I didn't know until about halfway through it! At the end, I could barely make out what was going on at points. This has many silly designs, especially helmets; for crying out loud, the *horses* aren't spared! The acting is average. This has utterly intolerable comic relief(in general, the humor is bad). There's a thong-wearing black chick(I'm gonna ruin countless of sexual fantasies with this, but... at times, she really does look like Wesley Snipes) who's usually wearing as little in the way of clothes as she can get away with by the censors. The princess can't conceal her British accent for a fraction of a line. There are hawt chicks in this, to be sure. The score tries, ah, it really does... and someone *needs* to give the composer a strong sedative, because he's amping up dully shot sequences of *riding*. No, really. The action isn't that exciting or adventurous, and there's not that much fencing. There are holes in the run-of-the-mill plot. Exposition is forced. There is a bit of bloody, brutal violence in this.
