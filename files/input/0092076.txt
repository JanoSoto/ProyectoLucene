[{"Title":"Amazing Grand Guignol Horror Film!","Date":"5 January 2003","Score":"78 out of 115 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is one of the most misunderstood movies of all time. I saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 when it was released in theaters back in 1986. I loved this horror flick then. But everyone else hated it. Critics trashed it. Even many horror fans, of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre or slashers in general, hated it and dismissed it. Now after a decade or so after its release, TCM 2 is now a bona fide cult movie.There are so many things to point out why TCM 2 is a stand-out. The first and most important thing to point out is that back in the 1980s, horror films were reduced to simple slashers. TCM 2 is totally different than the plethora of slashers that many horror fans expected to see, which is one reason why many horror fans didn't get it. The body count is extremely low in TCM 2 compared to the Friday the 13th or Elm Street flicks. But that doesn't mean it's not violent. No, it's VERY violent. But the violence in TCM 2 is more engrossing, shocking and even at times funny, and in turn less acceptable than the unreal violence found in many slasher films. Because of the amount of violence and violent imagery, films critics trashed TCM 2, pointing out how the first film didn't rely on gore and violence to scare the audience.I love Texas Chainsaw Massacre as much as I love TCM 2. I understand what the critics were saying. Unfortunately, they didn't get the point of the violence in TCM 2. While TCM is a sweat inducing TERRIFYING horror film in the first order, TCM 2 is a GRAND GUIGNOL HORROR horror film in the first order. In TCM 2, Hooper creates a vast canvas of baroque imagery, where we watch the insane and gory story unfold before our incredulous eyes. I'm amazed that critics missed the whole difference between TCM and TCM 2. It's odd that critics will rave about Peter Greenaway's THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER which is a twisted drama in the the Grand Guignol style, but didn't see TCM 2 in the same way. It's probably due to the fact that TCM 2 is a sequel to a quasi-legendary horror film and everyone expected the sequel to be the same as the first movie.I give credit to everyone involved with TCM 2. They actually TRIED to do something different different from the equally great TCM, different from the increasingly boring horror films of the 80s. And in my eye, they've succeeded. There are so many memorable scenes in TCM 2, some of which are the most amazing horror moments ever put on screen (when Leatherface tries to put the scalped face on Stretch, the scene when Stretch finds her friend sans face, etc). And there are so many quotable lines too. TCM 2 is also a very funny film (Rain, rain, rain, rain... Choptop says as he checks out records at the radio station).TCM 2 is not perfect. The ending is abrupt. And the chainsaw fight at the end is too short. Dennis Hopper is a bit hard to take as a hero. But he does play the twisted hero right. It's just difficult to see him fighting big and burly Leatherface. BTW, the very last image of TCM 2 is Strecth dancing with a chainsaw in her hands at the top of that amusement park structure. In the original film (and the original video release), we can see cars and trucks driving by on a highway in the distance. On the DVD, they cropped this shot and we don't see the traffic anymore. Personally, I thought it added a LOT to the whole surreal aspect of the film. Like the world was continuing on with its relentless pace, no matter what had just happened that night. I wished they didn't crop this shot on the DVD. Oh well...It's a shame few people got TCM 2 back then. After reading the reviews at IMDb and at Amazon, it's great to see that some are finally getting it. For anyone who's game, watch TCM 2. You'll be squealing in horror and laughing at the insanity of it all in equal amounts.

I knew going in it would be nothing like the original and was completely fine with that, but this movie goes out of its way to be as ridiculous as possible. The genuine scares from the original have been replaced by awkward comedic bits, from the cannibal family's bickering to Leatherface making silly faces (yeah, they had the audacity to turn Leatherface into a punchline). It's just embarrassing, and this is largely due to an inconsistent script. The first act sets an ominous tone from its premise of hearing a murder live on the radio and the radio host being terrorized by the same murderers. Then the second act is silly, borderline cartoonish with Leatherface acting like a hormonal teenager; and the third act tries to pay homage to the original by recreating the dinner scene almost exactly as it was in the first (but not nearly as effective) combined with an admittedly cool chainsaw duel between Lefty (Dennis Hopper) and Leatherface, then closing with a somewhat thrilling final struggle for the heroine to make her escape. Then it closes with another homage to the original and then credits roll and a cheesy '80s pop song ensues. If not for the second act, it had potential to be an engrossing story and potentially disturbing (the gore is still top-notch) but the drastic shifts in tone make it virtually impossible to become immersed into this overtly fake, cartoonish world.Thankfully, Tobe Hooper's directing makes even the dullest moments of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 aesthetically pleasing. The location and set design is perfect - the underground lair with brightly colored lights juxtaposed with rotting corpses and leftover entrails is oddly unsettling, and the scenery during the final moments of the movie is hauntingly beautiful. Hooper knows how to make these scenes look as gritty and urgent as possible. Dennis Hopper's Texas ranger was also a welcome addition. He was related to Franklin of the first movie and is out for revenge on these hillbillies so he buys the biggest chainsaw he can, then storms their lair screaming his lungs out like a lunatic.What ultimately killed this movie for me (aside from the script) is the lead actress. She is just awful. You can't take anything she says seriously because of how poorly she delivers her lines, and her screams are so forced and annoying I was practically rooting for Leatherface to chop her head off. Her relationship with Leatherface is also forced and awkward, but maybe that was the screenwriters' attempt at comedy. There are a couple laughs in this movie, and by that I mean two; three max. Something about the bombastic chainsaw duel is undeniably exhilarating, despite it not being fleshed out to its full potential.There is some fun to be had in this movie, but you have to suffer through a lot of stupidity to get there. I have no idea how sequels continued coming out after this, and I can even empathize why they would want to make a sequel reboot with Texas Chainsaw 3D, but that was even more abominable than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's true sequel - this - and this is pretty darn bad. This movie is for Leatherface completists only. "},{"Title":"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has not stopped.  It haunts Texas.","Date":"3 February 2002","Score":"45 out of 70 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is criminally underrated. I've noticed a lot of comments trashing this movie. It's a HORROR movie! It's also a SEQUEL to a horror movie! Where were your expectations people? What did you think you were going to be watching? I remember watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 as a kid, and it scared the s**t out of me. That opening bridge scene is incredible. It's one of the scariest sequences I've ever seen. Tom Savini's effects are top notch, the humor is well placed, and the acting is perfect for the genre. Bill Moseley (Chop Top) is something else. He's the reason I love this movie so much. He portrays one of the most memorable characters in recent horror history and I can't get enough of him. I do agree that Bill Johnson is not nearly as menacing as Gunnar Hansen in the role of Leatherface. But what's wrong with Tobe Hooper's direction? It's his story, let him tell it the way he wants to. I think Tobe Hooper succeeds in continuing the tale of one of the great horror icons. TCM 2 has loads of gore, campy acting, and instills a healthy dose of fear into it's viewer. What more could you ask of a sequel? And remember, the saw is family.

It will NOT save you a trip to the hospital.(spoilers) OK, let me tell you why the Texas Chainsaw sequels don't work. The original film is slightly exempt from this, but when you have someone who is screaming and wiggling so much that you wish she would just get killed so she'll shut the hell up, you have lost your ability to scare. Doesn't matter how good the sets or costumes or actors are, if the audience is holding their ears, you have a problem.The first sequel in the Texas Chainsaw series is meant to be nothing other than a bigger version of the original, this time fictionalized, and beefed up with the star power of Dennis Hopper. Not that the original was non-fiction. As you know, it was really based, very loosely, as it were, on the inhuman antics of Ed Gein in the 1950s, the same demented nutcase that inspired Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs. Sounds like a fun guy.Unfortunately, as is all too often the case with horror movies, this one comes off more as a sick comedy than a scary movie. Granted, there are horror movies that purposely come out like that, such as most of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, but the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a movie that caught people off guard because of its simplicity, its unknown cast, and its rough, documentary feel. In Texas Chainsaw 2, every single little bit of that is lost.The set, once we eventually get underground, looks like they rented the Indiana Jones set, festooned it with randomly placed naked light bulbs, furniture made out of human bones, and meat hooks, and had Leatherface run around swinging a chainsaw. The atmosphere of the movie has completely lost the claustrophobic feel of the original by vastly expanding the size of the set, much of which looks like a Christmas tree crossed with an esophagus, and there is just too much hooting and hollering for it to be scary. The only thing more irritating than the killers is their victim, 'Stretch.'The movie starts off with a couple of high school caricatures zooming down a desert highway, screaming at each other at the tops of their lungs about the sheer magnitude of the party that they are on their way to. They decide to swing into oncoming traffic to play chicken with someone driving a pickup truck, instantly making me eager to see them get killed. Doesn't matter that Leatherface is in that truck, anyone who plays chicken with a random driver because they're driving around drunk deserves to get killed. And if it takes place in a movie, they deserve to get killed with a chainsaw.So not only do we have to endure the hooting and hollering of these two jerks, but they call a radio station and we are asked to believe that this station's phones get completely tied up if someone calling in refuses to hang up. Sure, this is rural Texas and 1986, but are we to believe that even out there and back then, there were radio stations with a single phone line and without the ability to cut off the callers? At one point the clueless tech guy is frantically pushing buttons and pulling levers, trying to figure out how to clear the line. Given something so stupid, however, you know it was there for a reason, so that they could record the phone call as the kids get chainsawed on the other end. Speaking of which, the same kid that swerved into oncoming traffic at full speed finds himself stopped on a bridge as that same pickup truck sits blocking both lanes, and he frantically screams 'Are you crazy?!?' out the windshield while his idiot friend in the passenger seat offers such heroic tips as 'Just keep driving!' and 'Get outta here!' Good thinking'! Speaking of driving, not only can they not outrun a pickup truck traveling in reverse while supposedly holding the pedal to the floor in their Mercedes, but in the shots that show Leatherface standing and swinging his chainsaw, they are literally traveling all of 5mph.Dennis Hopper plays the uncle of the kids who were killed in the original movie, sort of a rogue detective out of his jurisdiction and showing up at the scene of the two kids' murder. The police refuse to jump to conclusions, but Lefty (Hopper) is sure that it's the same people who killed his nieces and nephews. Hopper makes a GREAT redneck. I generally am truly disappointed when actors take on fake accents, but Hopper does this one so well that you would swear he's lived in the south his entire life, it's just too bad that he's saddled with this idiot character.At one point, Stretch, the radio station DJ, shows up at his apartment, which, needless to say, is flooded with drunken rednecks wandering the halls with their arms around each other, and tells him that she has an audiotape of the murder because the kids called in just before they were attacked, and he sends her away! What the hell is that? Later he has a change of heart, but only wants to hear it if she'll play it on the air. The logic of the characters' actions in this movie is not starting off on the right foot. Then later, as Stretch hangs in a pit about to fall into the demons' lair, you might say, he tries to save her with a brittle, dried out arm bone. Clever.There is a lengthy horror scene inside the radio station, which looks like it doesn't know if it's supposed to be a radio station or a horror movie set, so better just be a little bit of both. It's got its vast storage of records stored safely behind an open door, with a heavy steel door guarding the cleaning supplies. A burglar's dream, you might say. We get a scene where Leatherface is assigned to kill Stretch, but when he finally gets through that steel door, he starts chainsawing a tub of soda cans sitting in ice, which have no reason for being there or for being chainsawed, until finally Stretch screams, 'Are you mad at me??' and my eyes glaze over for the remainder of the film.There's an effective scene where Leatherface puts Stretch's friend's freshly removed face over hers, supposedly to help her escape, but for the most part the underground portion of the film is a tired rehash of the original. Sure, it's bigger, there are more Christmas lights and more chainsaws, but essentially it's exactly the same thing, just without the surprise. They even replay exactly the same dinner scene from the end of the last movie, the most unpleasant scene in the entire movie. Lefty decides that he is so intent on delivering swift poetic justice that, rather than stock up on as many guns as he can carry, he buys three huge chainsaws and straps them to his body, and then runs screaming into the house, yelling and cutting down wooden supports as the family tortures Stretch. In Commando Arnold bulldozes into a weapons store and loads up on boatloads of guns and knives and explosives. In The Terminator he does the same thing, with the added bonus of killing off the proprietor before leaving. Lefty could have paid homage to both of those films, establishing Lefty as a good guy since he actually paid for his. But why saws and not guns? The grandparents, as is to be expected, are a hideous, hideous spectacle. Grandpa's 137 years old and still likes to hammer young girls on the head, and grandma spends her time in a wheelchair upstairs with a chainsaw on her lap. We are treated to a finale atop a huge rock outcropping that is so fake that it almost turns the movie into a comedy all by itself. There is at least one or two shots where the underlying chicken wire is nakedly visible.We get some sort of variation on the ending of the original, since the conclusion is almost a mirror image, in that the girl becomes the chainsaw wielding maniac rather than looking at him out the back window of a passing motorist, but I'm not sure what line of discussion led to the conclusion that this would be a cool way to end the film. Is this supposed to be the setup for a sequel? The family's dead, but now there's this girl who has caught chainsaw fever and will now carry on the legacy?

This second is a strange (even stranger than the original) very sick ( a man forces a woman to wear her friends face??) and very budget blown (the appearance of Dennis Hopper).We have Leather Face, Drayton (from the original we new him as old man) and Chop Top who is a new addition to the family who is (although probably the most deranged) a kind of funny and lovable character, he is very similar to the hitchhiker from the original except a Vietnam steel plated and (oddly) pale white skin colour.A radio DJ (Stretch) gets prank called by two irritating gun ho kids in a car speeding down the motorway, but one of these prank calls just happen to be made at a wrong time as the two are chased by Leather Face in a opposite car and funnily enough kills them by chainsaw and its all been recorded on a live radio station. This makes Stretch closer to Lefty (dennis hopper) who is a family member of Franklyn (weelchair victim) in the original massacre wanting to hunt down the maniacs for revenge. The appearance of this recorded footage brings Lefty closer to catching the maniacs who is now out for Stretch for making the recording. The plot proceeds on to Stretch being held captive in the theme park style underground layer of the maniacs and Lefty roaring through chopping the place down with his chainsaw.This is higher budget, meaning its got loads more action and the set pieces are even creepier and outstandingly made. The acting is pretty good as this time they had the money to buy proper actors. Although its unrealistic (living in an underground theme park layer filled with over 100 bodies used as props, people being chased in their car by a guy standing on top of his truck with a chainsaw on a bridge, the final battle between Dennis Hopper and Leather Face using chainsaws)its still a cult classic and very well directed. The original is superior but the second instalment is by far not a disappointment, more of a higher budget fun thrill ride with jumps, scares and even some funny parts which are hard not to laugh. The bad parts are the rushed beginning which we don't really know a thing about Lefty or why he's so mad and the fact that Leather Face now has feelings and becomes a little bit puffy at times. Apart from that all this this is one of the stupidest films ever nonsense is, quite plainly nonsense.Better than the other instalments and the remake, not better than the original.

So it always had a place in my mind as a movie to avoid. However, when I finally did catch it, I have to say I disagree.This movie was incredibly stupid. Every scare is telegraphed, nothing is a surprise. Leatherface dances around more with the chainsaw then cutting anyone. It's really idiotic. The performances aren't much better than your local churches haunted house on Halloween.First, we're supposed to believe a radio station can't hang up on a caller unless the caller does first? I think the FCC would have something to say about that. It'd be impossible to censor any obscene calls that way. Also, what exactly does the tape reveal that Chop Top and Leatherface need to show up and silence the girl about? Some screams and a chainsaw noise. Yeah, that really points out their identities and existence. A damn autopsy would reveal the cause of death was power tool. Beyond that there's NOTHING linking them. Texas is a damn big state. And as the prologue indicates, after the first girl was found alive, the authorities found NOTHING to prove the events had happened. Plus, they could have just torched the place when they left the girl if they really wanted to be sure.I watched it a second time last night, and I have to say it's gotten dumber.

This nice little sequel (thats right! a GOOD sequel), the attention could easily be said to circle around Williamss' Stretch, but Dennis Hopper gets the only billing. One normal day in Texas, two naughty little highschool brats decide to have fun, by calling in a radio station(hosted by an enthusiastic Williams) and play chicken with other texans, they think. Later, these angered Texans turn out to be, uh huh! Ya, we all know who, as they attack the little brats one dark night following the earlier prank. Williams Stretch catches all of this gore galore on tape, and exposes it on her show as a favor for Hopper. Hopper has underacted character who's revenge for the massacre and torture of his nephew and niece (Sally and Franklin from the first) is somewhat unconvincible to an extent, but he has better moments. Williams, on the other hand, is very into her character and obviously takes it to the next level, with some hammy moments resaulting. Still, after she exposes the missing Saw-yer family-she is next! Pretty scary stuff. Nice little set-up puts her in an awfully creepy confrontation with Moseleys' Chop-Top. Then the real terror begins. This one could easily be said to have been just a little more expanded than the first, and I certainly say so. I do, however, put the first one on a higher stand, nothing will ever beat the original nightmare, which still scares to this day. Though Massacre 2 has its real moments of both horror and comedy, it drags in the last real, and won't give up! Tobe Hooper must have worked em all with this one, but its all the same a great fun movie. To say it is bad, would be too harsh, I definitely give this one a thumbs up, and ya know what? I'm not the only one!

Despite being made on such a low-budget, Tobe Hooper managed to make what was arguably one of the most influential Horror films of all time. It's gritty, eerie atmosphere has never been matched. Thirteen years after that, Hooper returned with the much anticipated sequel, starring Dennis Hopper. With a bigger budget, an audience behind it and a big studio, this was set to be a superb, nasty and even gorier film than the first one. But it was a complete disaster, and is possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen.OK, so it's first mistake was it stylistically trying to turn away from the original and be it's own film. The second mistake, and the BIGGEST, was trying to add humour and some light-heartiness into the blood and guts mix. This is labelled as a comedy, why didn't I notice this before? I wouldn't have wasted my time if I had known what this was going to be. It's a complete two finger salute at the original, and ironically, Tobe Hooper directed this. What the hell was the man doing? He almost ruined everything he had achieved. Granted, the film is somewhat more violent and nastier than the original, one scene that stuck with me was when a man gets his head and face smashed in with a hammer while his assailant yells MAIL CALL! each time the hammer hits him. The plot is extremely thin and simple Dennis Hopper plays Lefty, an obsessed sheriff whose niece was the surviving girl from the first film. We are told at the beginning that no trace of Leatherface or the farmhouse was ever found, but the legend still remained in Texas. The film begins with two of the most detestable people I've ever come across in a film speeding down a road shooting signs. One of them, the one shooting and screaming, would have received a fine ass-kicking from me if I'd been given the chance. They call a radio DJ named 'Stretch' (Caroline Williams) and start harassing her. For reasons unexplained, she won't cut them off, so when the two boys mess with the wrong pick-up truck (You guessed it... it's the Sawyer family, with Leatherface riding shotgun!), they are murdered and the whole thing is caught on tape by 'Stretch'. When she plays it on air, Leatherface and his brother Top-Chop come after her, and it's up to Lefty to help her and confront Leatherface and his posse with his own chainsaw... the buzz is back indeed. God help us.What started off promising enough quickly went down hill afterwards. Straight away you know that this film lacks the dread and gritty cacophonous atmosphere that made the first film the masterpiece that it is. Dennis Hopper was rarely seen in the early eighties before this, not after his small role in Apocalypse Now, but his career seemed to kick off again after this film, with performances in River's Edge, Hoosiers, Chattahoochee and Blue Velvet to see out the decade for him. He is as good as he possibly could be given the dry-as-wood character he had to play, who only really came to life once he got down into Leatherface's subterranean home and started giving the family a taste of their own chainsaw medicine. Caroline Williams does a lot of screaming... so I reckon that's a good performance considering the type of movie this is which rarely ever expects it's female leads to do anything more than scream and look towards the hero of the hour. Thankfully that has changed nowadays to a certain degree. Something good about the modern horror genre.This is a great deal nastier than the first movie at times. The aforementioned 'hammer' scene was pretty brutal and hard to watch, and there's also a well done scene at the beginning when one of the moronic dweebs gets half his head severed off with a chainsaw. The special effects that were non-existent in the first film were shown off here with a scene where Leatherface cuts off one of his victims faces and proceeds to try it on. Leatherface is terrible in this. Bill Johnson portrays him and he is certainly no Gunnar Hansen! He's not as menacing or mysterious as he was in the first movie, but is actually extremely laughable and sleazy. His brother Chop-Top, who is the twin brother of the 'hitch hiker' from the first film and wasn't present in it because he was away fighting in Vietnam, was extremely annoying. He's got a steel plate in his head from an injury he sustained in the war, and he frequently claws at it with a clothes hanger that he carries around. Grandpa also returns in this one, and is now 137 years-old (You all remember the half-dead guy the boys dragged down from the attic in the first film to torture the girl?), well he does his grandson Leatherface no favours during his final duel with Lefty, when he attempts to throw a hammer at Lefty but ends up striking his grandson instead. Nice one, gramps! The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 had the potential to be a brilliant, worthy sequel. And it may have achieved this had it never even considered it's comedy approach. I wonder why Tobe Hooper did this? I reckon the studio forced him into it in order for the film to get an R-rating and find a bigger audience. A truly awful film. Please, if you have any respect for the first film, avoid this total disgrace.

They are a permanent part of our culture, which is both a positive and a negative thing when you look at it. By definition a sequel is a continuation of a story, but often times the magic just isn't there the second time around. You have to find a way to keep things fresh, while keeping fans happy by not straying too far from what came before. The original 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is one of the most frightening and powerful horror films of all time and would be a tough act to follow. Tobe Hooper, director and co-writer, of said film would take a stab at following it up with the first of a few sequels 12 years later. What he came up with is one of the most bizarre horror films ever and one that thankfully is not a xerox copy of it's predecessor.Pros Great cast and everyone seems to be having the time of their lives. Tongue is planted firmly in cheek. Tom Savini's effects are top-notch. Plenty of blood and gore. Moves at a decent pace. Fabulous design on the families hideout. Good score. You'll love to hate the Sawyer family again, which includes a truly twisted new addition.Cons The change in tone is fine, but this sequel is really lacking in the scare and suspense department. Plot wears thin. Some scenes drag on a bit too long. Ends rather abruptly.Final thoughts Can't compare with the original, but this belated sequel is still a joy to watch for fans. It's not one of those sequels that seems to have been made solely for the money.

It kind of makes you realise that the whole film came about in the same way. The ideas were put to paper a little too fast, there wasn't enough time just having it sit in the writers head growing, and becoming refined.The nest part of the intro, the ten minutes with the frat boys shooting signs and then playing chicken with the wrong hill billies, was awful, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth that pretty much sticks around for the rest of the movie. The tone and pace of the whole sequence is so different to the rest of the film, it just doesn't even fit in right, and a much better re-introduction of the maniacal family was really in order.The comical bits were pretty stupid, as if that was the direction they wanted to go in, it should've been very dark humour...It could've been very disturbingly funny. The end scene in the original with the grandpa trying to bludgeon the girl with the hammer is pretty powerful, one of the few scenes in any movie that scares me a little, it feels like your in the same messed up situation. The end scene in this is just....meh.If the film was more dark, the final shot in this, mirroring the final shot of leather face in the first. Again would've been powerful and really effective.Bill Moseley asking if the tape was from the Rambo 3 soundtrack was retarded, not just because the movie only came out two years after this (I just looked that up, didn't know it off the top of my head), which could've still made sense and is not necessarily a goof. But it doesn't make sense that the family would know what Rambo was, as they are segregated from society and only the dad interacts with other people.I liked the chilli cook off idea. That worked well with the black humour theme, it's just too bad everything else they tried didn't.Once again Tobe Hooper shows of his ability to shot the exterior's of buildings really well.

If it wasn't for the star-power of Dennis Hopper and the desirableness of Caroline Williams, this sequel would have totally stunk in my opinion. The writing was really awful, especially hack in the beginning car chase and cook-off. Usually, a horror film is either great in the beginning and fades off or starts slow with a great ending. With TCM II, it's a first for me to say that a few scenes in the middle of the film were the most entertaining.The film lost a lot of grittiness and distinguishing characteristics that the predecessor possessed. It didn't tie itself well to its roots and I felt this was a really rushed attempt that could have been a lot better. Part 2 did enough though to hold my interest and I found myself not being too critical of the ending scenes even though it's pretty bad. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, or the franchise itself, is perhaps not really my cup of tea but as a horror fan I understand it's importance and still think it's a must watch.

They tend to be nothing but an endless repetition of the original, as if they are fearful of trying something new and not only not reaching a new audience but also losing the original's fans. So, I was suspicious of this; more so because of how great the original was.Maybe it's the fact Tobe Hooper returns and is in control of the film (something that obviously wasn't the case in Spielberg's 'Poltergeist'). Hooper is good enough a filmmaker to know that he couldn't top/repeat the sense of realism that made the first 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' so powerful, so he instead dared to take a different approach he takes it easy and satirizes itself. Whereas the first TCM was extremely real, suspenseful, and surprisingly not very bloody/gory, 'Part 2' is high on blood, gore and an horror atmosphere that, while far from realistic, is still very effective. Yet, the film never takes itself too seriously; it is full of a dark, macabre and self-satirizing sense of humor, with very twisted and even depraved gags and an omnipresent black humor even in the more 'serious' parts.Of course, it sometimes exaggerates (Dennis Hopper often overdoes on the insane acting, and I found Chop-Top rarely funny), or even become severely inappropriate/deranged (Leatherface's confrontation with the DJ, for example). However, it is nonetheless fun most of the time (the chainsaw fight must be seen to be believed).All in all, it is a very good horror film that has been far too (and unjustly) vilified. It is well directed and thought-out, never taking itself too serious but never fully falling into the absurd/laughable category of horror; while far from the original's level, it is a very worthy sequel.

While on the phone with the guys, Leatherface murders both of them Stretch manages to hear the chainsaw in the background. The police try to make their deaths seem like a simple auto accident, but when a former Texas Ranger Lefty (Dennis Hopper) sees the accident scene, he knows it was more than an accident. And when Stretch gives him the audio tape of the murder, he realizes that Leatherface has struck again. Once the infamous Sawyer family catches on that people know of their crimes, they trap Stretch in their sick twisted maze of dead corpses and rotting flesh.Chainsaw 2 was made at a time when it was competing with the Krueger/Myers/Vorhees sequels. So it had to live up to the modern day slasher film, that means more blood. It's a lot more gory than the controversial first TCM. In this one, you literally see a guy get skinned alive, his face is almost peeled off for Leatherface to use as a mask. Oh and the family is explored more in this sequel. Jim Siedow reprises the role of The Cook Drayton Sawyer. He now sells chili to the fine people of Texas. He proclaims at a local cook off that it's his special secret recipe. Take a guess what he uses to make the chili....Yeah so as you can see, TCM 2 is a little more morbid and comical in a black comedy sort of way. The maze that Stretch gets trapped in near the end is an old amusement park that the Sawyers are living in. Very creepy set they built for it as well. The acting is pretty good for this one as well. We also discover Dennis Hopper's character is related to Franklin, the man in the wheelchair from the first TCM. Nice little connection. All in all, a decent sequel to a 70's classic.

It is my third favorite horror film and I treasure it for it's memories of disgust but intelligent scares. That was Tobe Hooper's good and only really scary film.Now the his sequel The Buzz is Back! isn't a bad sequel at all though it really falls on the lines of the original as Tobe decided to go to a more comedic root instead of sticking to the horror ones. The horror roots were put back into the third and fourth though they are way beyond crappy.Moving on I'll point out the good and bad plotters for TCM 2.The good The acting is still good especially Bill Moselsy who played the insane, cannibalistic f***ed up Chop Top who loves his dead corpses. The only returning character (s) is Dawerer (I think that's his name) and he still did a good job. Dennis Hopper also did really well and the back up actors were average.The kills aren't great though there bloody enough. 1 point there.The music also had a weird feel to it and the humor was contained well and there were enough scenes to make me enjoy this film a lot.The bad The only problem I had with this film was that even if the humor was average and contained well, it sucked that Tobe Hooper took it to a different level and the scares are no where to be found. That's the only major problem other wise.....6.5/10 (It's another good slasher film if your bored and it has the right amount of enjoyment leaking out of it) I would watch this awesome sequel than wasting my time on TCM 3, TCM Next Gen and TCm the Beginning.

On the back is a strange looking character. He whips out his chain saw and saws off the top of the boy driving which results in a terrible car crash. The killer was, of course, Leatherface.         Stretch had got the whole thing on tape. The screaming and the saw buzzing. This whole thing seemed to interest Texas Marshall, Lt. 'Lefty' Enright. Lefty was the father of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, from the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Stretch tried showing the tape to Lefty, even play it on the air. Lefty didn't seem at all interested, but he secretly knew all about these sick people and wanted very much to get revenge on them for killing his son. He goes to a hardware store, buys three chain saws, two little ones and one big one. He tries them out aggressively on a log. That night, Stretch found a weird character in the studio. His name was Chop Top. He was also the hitchhiker from the first movie. He had heard Stretch's tape over the air and seemed very interested in it. Suddenly, out of the record room came Leatherface, or Bubba, with his chain saw roaring. He chased Stretch into a storeroom where she was somehow able to talk him down, so Leatherface and Chop Top left, taking L.G. McPeters, Stretch's partner with them. She followed them to their secluded spot.          Lefty also arrived; in their secluded spot, skeletons and human bones were everywhere. Also down there was Dreyton Sawyer and Grandpa! Stretch witnessed the gruesome skinning of L.G., then Lefty burst in with his chain saws for a showdown! Sawyer had a grenade and it went off, but it is unclear whether he, Lefty and Leatherface were blown sky high. Stretch takes a chain saw from Grandma's skeleton, starts it up and screams like a maniac.        My opinion somewhat of a downer. This one is much more violent than the first. Dennis Hopper is here. Caroline Williams, who plays Stretch, also appeared in Leprechaun 3. Also, in the opening narration, the narrator says the van that belonged to Sally Hardesty and her friends was a Volkswagen. It wasn't. It was a GMC, I think, or maybe a Chevy. And this is also the only one where Sally was referred to as Sally Hardesty-Enright. She wasn't called that in the first one.

Nothing here except a lot of gore, noise and bombast, all amounting to nothing.To be fair, we're not in HOBGOBLINS territory here. But the final shot, with our short-shorts babe doing a chainsaw jiggle dance - makes me wonder what the heck they were smoking.George Romero (with a lot of help from Dario Argento) made a grand leap from the bleak horror of NOTLD to DAWN, with sharp social commentary, and the humor, such as it is in DAWN, is well placed it's NOT a comedy.All of TCM_2 should have been left on the cutting room floor, so to speak.

Now, while they did create a brilliant film which most now see as a classic, in their intentions, they did fail. Twelve years later, Hooper enlisted L.M. Kit Larson (Wim Wender's great Paris, Texas) to write him a sequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre appropriately titled The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. Larson's screenplay was witty, satirical, and much, much more violent than the original film, which contained much less violence than it is known for. To bring the gore Larson wrote in his screenplay to celluloid, Hooper teamed up with the wizard of gore himself, Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead, Maniac). Savini's gore looks great and at some points is truly gruesome, thanks to the great cinematography by Richard Kooris. Kooris' cinematography a bizarre yet beautiful feel the original did not have. The age make-up on the grandfather character is also considerably better than in the first film. The music as well, which in the first one was much more avant garde and ultimately bland, here is exciting and really fun.While Bill Johnson is certainly no Gunnar Hansen at playing Leatherface, this is made up for in the supporting roles, especially those by Bill Moseley (The Devil's Rejects) and Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Land of the Dead). Hopper's character of an insane sheriff hunting down the Leatherface clan is great, but appears to have a much more complex layer to him than the other characters.

The atmosphere was great--a family of murderous cannibals, who even make furniture out of the limbs and skeletons, and Leatherface wears masks made out of skin.  The hitchhiker gave a truly great performance with one of the snidest smiles I ever saw, and Marilyn Burns has the best scream I've ever heard.

Gunnar Hansen is out as Leatherface and his replacement looks like he's trying to do the Funky Chicken while he plays with his chainsaw, and he seriously looks like Quasimodo.  Two kids making harassing phone calls to a radio station get sliced to pieces (or at least rubber cutouts of them do) while making the call, and the radio DJ Stretch plays it on the air, prompting a visit from Leathermodo and Chop Top.  Leatherface spares her, instead attempting to get her off with his turned-off chainsaw (I am not making this up, I swear). They kill her partner, who they later skin, and leave, and she follows them, where she lands in a body pit.The remainder of the film is lots of screaming, hollering, and yelling, and Dennis Hopper does his best Barney Phife impersonation, while Drayton Sawyer (the cook) seems to do a complete 180 from his character the previous movie (wasn't he the squeamish one when it came to killings?)I can't believe what a huge dropoff this is from the first movie.  some bits are so bad they're hilarious, but if I want to watch a 'so bad it's good' comedic horror film, I'll watch Evil Dead 2.

It's rare when you see a film so elaborate, constructed so rich with visual detail that you get a great sense of atmosphere (the underground setting), but also so terrible in ever other way to cause one to stop and ponder the extent to which films could be made bad all the while cognizant of the fact that it takes many professional individuals collectively to take on a project such as this. Basically I ask why? How?OK. Maybe it isn't THAT bad.  I remember renting this with 2 of my friends a couple of years ago.  Disbelief abounded.  That is the best way I can express laconically the reaction to the sequel to the cult classic TCM. Disbelief as to how the characters could be so corny, the dialogue so bad, the plot so incredibly paper thin.  In all honesty, it was so bad it was hilarious, and we have since, on many occasions, recalled some of the films's more memorable scenes such as the one in the beginning when a poor young college boy gets a generous portion of his head sliced off by ole Leatherface himself, despite the fact that he's behind the wheel of a speedy 4x4 and you would think that he would do whatever it took to prevent his brain from being hacked open like a ripe apple (like maybe ducking).  Also, the acting by the lead actress was decent.It was nice I guess to see Dennis Hopper in this film, but I would seriously question his sincerity if he told me personally that the TCM2 was just the dignity injection that his career needed.1 out of 10.

I was a 12 year old full of acne when I first rented it at the nearest videostore and completely ignorant at the time of the first one because French cultural institutions were still very reticent towards shocking works-of-art. I recently re watched TCM 2 on DVD and, in possession of many elements of comparison between the 2 films, I am not afraid to put it on an equal level of quality next to its predecessor for the followings 1) It is a motivated and consistent sequel  the murderous and cannibalistic family is still on the loose. An atrocious series of crimes remained unpunished, which justifies the part of Dennis Hopper, uncle of the Hardestys. 2) The way he accomplishes his vengeance brings laugh, the lone and mystic ranger way, like an angel of retribution with God and saws on his side. The change of tonality was severely criticized but let's face it, had Tobe Hooper filmed the same first-degree tale of horror, fans would have been much harsher. This mixture of western and horror makes it an original and entertaining sequel. So please don't crucify the creator too much ! 3) As in the first one, analysis can be added to pleasure. No matter what savagery the Sawyers commit, they are still victims of recession, unemployment and automation, not just plain psycho-killers. The introduction of Chop Top, Viet Nam veteran brother to Leatherface, constitutes a real point of interest  the superimposition of one tale of historic horror to another one in film. This, in my opinion, refutes any accusation of trivialized violence. Last but not least, the impossible romance of Leatherface simulating a penetration with his saw rather turns him more into a pathetic than crude individual. We would almost sympathize. 4) Some touches of macabre and amoral humor are really enjoyable  the chili contest won by a certain Sawyer. Would we realize it if we were fed human flesh ? Would we savor it if we were told it was a secret of longevity (cf 137 years old Granpa Sawyer) ? This disturbs and amuses at the same time the horror fan that I am. As a conclusion, in spite of its commercial failure of the time, this film deserves reconsideration in memory of an age long forgotten, when horror films were not all merely franchises targeted to sex freak teenagers. Ever since what has followed TCM 2, there has not been a single ounce of creativity or interest, apart from a few gore novelties and demonstrations of free sadism  TCM 3 is not about the same family, TCM 4 is just terrible, the 2003 remake and its prequel do not mention cannibalism and clumsily try to tell the youth of Leatherface without any explanation about how he came to be what he is, pointless. TCM and TCM 2 form an efficient diptych to spike a night of boredom or weary tranquility. If you have not seen the others yet, don't waste your time trying !

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a cult classic, and since Tobe Hooper returns to the director's chair, you might think this would be a decent sequel. You'd be dead wrong.When Tobe Hooper directed the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre, he did it on a shoestring budget. It ended up being a cult classic, and the low budget gave it a style all its own. He was given a much bigger budget for this sequel. What he does wrong is take his big budget and try to make it look as low budget as the first film. This doesn't give it style, it makes it look ridiculous. The other big problem is that this movie was turned into a comedy when it should have been horror. The family is now a bunch of bumbling fools, including Leatherface. Leatherface was originally an inhuman killing machine, but now he has mercy toward a woman he's supposed to kill because he's horny. The plot and dialogue are absolutely ridiculous.The acting is atrocious. Dennis Hopper is usually okay for a b-movie actor, but he is especially bad in this movie.

The cannibalistic family are still up to their usual hijinks, and Dennis Hopper stars as an ex-Federal Marshal who has sworn revenge for the deaths of his brother's kids in the first film. There's a bigger movie budget this time, allowing for the family to relocate from their farmhouse to an labyrinthine underground lair beneath a cheesy tourist attraction which looks like something out of a Mario Bava film. A screenplay by L.M. Kit Carson (Paris, Texas) and makeup effects by Tom Savini. The first death in the film is a 90-mile-an-hour car chase/chainsaw-induced head wound set to Oingo Boingo's song No One Lives Forever... now look me in the eye, and tell me that that doesn't sound better than Citizen Kane? As fate would have it, though, this film is actually completely terrible. It's about as far removed from its predecessor as Killer Klowns from Outer Space is from Psycho. I don't know how, or why, but some idiot somewhere decided to play this film for yucks. Presumably, their reasoning was that it would be too hard to try and outdo the original in terms of grueling ferocity, so they opted instead to mix the gore with slapstick. It might have looked good on paper, but the filmmakers amped the goofiness up to eleven and it really all falls to pieces.Replacing Edwin Neal in the role of The Hitchhiker is Bill Moseley, who is 1,000,000 times more irritating here than he is in the overrated The Devil's Rejects. Prancing about, picking his metal-domed head with a rusty coathanger (don't ask) and giggling manically like an evil Jimmy Fallon, he embodies about everything that is wrong with this movie. Well, just about everything, because then there's also Leatherface. Gone is the unstoppable, ruthless killing machine we all know and love, and in his place, we have a puppy-eyed, Quasimodoesque lunkhead with a strange preference towards dry-humping young women with the aid of his chainsaw instead of chopping them to bits without hesitation. I can only assume Hooper was going for some kind of Blue Velvet parody here... which brings us to Mr. Hopper. Even when he's tearing around the family's lair, slicing everyone and everything up with his chainsaw and shouting I am the Lord of the Harvest!!! at the top of his lungs, he still looks bored and confused. One for them indeed.Amazingly, this film actually does have a substantial fanbase. Many of them insist that anyone who doesn't like this film could only be an unpleasable complaint-artist who wouldn't be satisfied with anything that wasn't exactly like the original.

I only had some interest in it after reading some reviews here that claimed the movie wasn't as bad as some made it out to be, or that it didn't live up to the original, but held up on its own as a different take on the story.  Well, rather than flesh out the strange details of the first movie, TTCM2 rewrites nearly everything, and the details that are brought back are simply repeated ad-nauseum.  Rather than an interesting, more detailed view of Leatherface's family, I found characters who were repetetive, annoying, and even boring at times.  The best part of this movie is the opening text, which treats itself seriously.  Then, immediately, we're warped into 1986, complete with goofy acting and ridiculous clothes.  The characters don't act, they just yell their lines at the top of their lungs.  And the incoherent Leatherface appearance at the beginning should have been enough warning that the entire movie would be this unwatchable.The movie isn't scary, but it does go out of its way to make you feel uncomfortable.  House of 1000 corpses is a far, far tamer movie, and is actually an enjoyable camp-fest compared to this drivel.  I thought the character chop-top would have some redeeming value, as one of his lines is sampled in a Primus song, and the actor that plays him seemed fairly proud of himself for playing the character in the House of 1000 corpses DVD interviews.  Instead, I find a character trying desperately to be funny and psychotic, and coming across as nothing more than stupid acting.  If you've seen Dumb and Dumberer or other comedies that try too damn hard to be funny, so hard that no sublety or believability is left, then you have every last character in this movie.The acting is intolerably dumb.  Every last scene is a gruelling test of endurance.  I don't care what drugs you're using, they won't get you through this film.  Your ears will bleed from hearing everyone shout their lines badly into the camera.  I can understand sub-par sequels.  i can tolerate bad movies.  But this is far worse than bad.  This is god awful.  It looks like it was directed by retarded sixth graders.  This does no justice to either the classic movie or the remake.

Not only is the acting bad, it's tainted with 80's style.  It does not age well.

Simultaneously using Stretch as bait and protecting her from the Sawyers is bug-eyed weirdo Dennis Hopper, playing the demented, chainsaw packing sheriff and uncle to one of the previous films unfortunate victims.This movie is definitely played for comedy, black as it may be. It's almost a retelling of the first tale, as Stretch runs screaming through the Sawyers underground abode, only to end up bent over a washtub while Grandpa feebly whacks away at her head with a hammer. There's a great chainsaw-as-penis scene, where Leatherface suddenly discovers sex and orgasms and promptly loses interest in chainsawing Stretch to death. There's also a hideous hammer murder and a gruesome defacing scene, just so you don't forget that, no matter how hilarious, this movie is still about over-the-top gore, mutilations, cannibalism and fates worse than death. Just when your stomach starts lurching, along comes another sickening joke to relieve the tension.This is a brilliantly done film, made even better by its offbeat humor and oddly likable characters.

Nah, it's not something I rate highly.This bizarre sequel only crossed my radar when I saw it on sale rather cheap and I was surprised by how much I liked it. Taking place 13 years after the first movie it opens with a couple of Yuppies being massacred with a chainsaw (sadly, the only chainsaw massacres in the whole movie) and the case promptly investigated by renegade Texas Ranger 'Lefty' Enright (the brilliant Dennis Hopper). The sound of the killing is caught on tape by radio DJ-type lady 'Stretch', who Lefty uses as bait to lure Leatherface out of the shadows. The trail leads to the labyrinthine catacombs beneath an abandoned amusement park for an epic showdown that doesn't really happen.The problem begins with the second half in which Dennis Hopper seems to wander off into a different movie and nothing really becomes of his character while Stretch runs screaming from a horny Leatherface. It's a bit disappointing in this regard, but the wonderful set-design and gore effects keep it interesting. I just wish that there was more fodder for the titular chainsaw.A lot of people consider this to be a spoof, but I don't think so myself. Horror movie-making had changed a lot by this point in the 80s. With slashers and the tools of their trade gaining popularity the genre moved away from gritty, grindhouse darkness and into something more colorful and mainstream (for better or worse).

Lefty, played by the always excellent Dennis Hopper, is one of the coolest horror film protagonists ever and his determination to bring the demented Sawyer family down is what kept me so entertained while watching this awesome flick. He and Caroline Williams have great chemistry.

Things still get pretty intense, but there is a more blatantly humorous approach (albeit in a dark way) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is very campy stuff. Therefore, it may take more than one viewing to be able to appreciate it, as was the case for this viewer. Gone, also, is the suggestion of horrible violence, to be replaced by much more obvious, in-your-face gore supervised by makeup effects master Tom Savini. And he does some extremely impressive work here. The story has a nutty former Texas Ranger, Lefty Enright (Dennis Hopper) obsessed with revenge against the cannibalistic Sawyer clan, as he turns out to be the uncle of the Sally and Franklin characters from the first film. Lefty leans upon radio DJ Stretch Brock (sexy, husky voiced Caroline Williams) to air a tape she'd made of two dim bulb kids being slaughtered by Leatherface while tooling down the highway. This only angers the Sawyer family, who proceed to terrorize Stretch over and over again. One very effective element to this sequel is its visual design; things are taken to another level in terms of the production design, lighting, and set decoration, as the Sawyers have headquartered in an old run down theme park. The music score, credited to Hooper and Jerry Lambert, is decidedly more conventional than that of the first film, and the eclectic soundtrack includes tunes by the likes of Timbuk 3, Concrete Blonde, The Cramps, and Stewart Copeland. The early set piece on the highway is a great one, and the action in the old park takes on an unrelenting, nightmarish tone, although ultimately it's not quite as effective as the simplicity of the first TCSM. The acting is over the top from most everybody concerned; Hopper is a hoot in his unhinged performance, Williams does a lot of screaming (so much of it that it may annoy some viewers), Jim Siedow is delightful as the put upon Drayton Cook Sawyer, Bill Johnson (replacing Gunnar Hansen) gets to show us a different side of Leatherface, and Bill Moseley, in a hell of a breakthrough performance, is memorable as live wire Chop Top. Ken Evert takes over the role of Grandpa from John Dugan, and Lou Perryman is endearing as good ol' boy L.G.; his final scene with Williams is really fairly poignant. The screenplay, by L.M. Kit Carson, contains some gems of dialogue, and there's one very enjoyable jump scare during the confrontation sequence at the radio station. While the excesses of this sequel may not appeal to some tastes, they're bound to delight others.

There's no question that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the most truly scary and horrifying films the genre has ever been graced with, so any sequel is pretty much pre-destined to be a lesser experience. However, if you can manage the seemingly impossible task of forgetting all about TCM and focusing solely on what this film brings to the table, you will be forced to grudgingly conclude that while Masscare 2 doesn't venture anywhere near the heights of Tobe Hooper's original macabre masterpiece, this unnecessary sequel is still a fun romp in its own right.The tone here is so far removed from the movie it reprises that it's hard to believe that Hooper was once again sitting in the director's chair. While Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a relentless and brutal tour de force of terror, Part 2 inserts a black humor sensibility that discards any pretensions of this being a strictly horror-based vehicle, and shifts our entire view of the cannibalistic Sawyer clan. This time out, the family doesn't come across as a hideously deranged group of killers, but rather as somewhat goofy collective of sadists whose tastes for violence veer closer to the physical comedy of The Three Stooges than to anything in the fright flick canon. Admittedly, this shouldn't work as well as it does, but a brilliant performance from Bill Mosely, who handily steals the show, straddles the fine line between gruesome and giggling and keeps the film from sinking beneath its playful facade.The plot is fairly ridiculous by any standards, and when the impetus for lead heroine Caroline Williams to be stalked by the saw-happy band of lunatics is her repeatedly playing an audio recording of a brutal murder on her radio show, we know right away that we're going to have to suspend our disbelief to swallow this one.Hooper's direction is surprisingly keen considering the radical departure he's overseeing, and he keeps us wondering exactly how far into the realm of absurdist comedy the film is going to reach until about the midway point. When an amusingly manic Dennis Hopper straps a pair of chainsaws to his hips like six-shooters and charges into the meat-loving family's lair screaming like Rambo, it should be abundantly clear to even the most jaded viewer that the film isn't going to bother to take itself seriously, and we shouldn't either.Despite the heavy emphasis on morbid funnies, the film does throw a few solid scares into the mix, and these jump-inducing moments arrive precisely when we've let our guard down, giving them unexpected and jolting impact. There's also a fairly generous amount of gore, and the effects work of Tom Savini adds immeasurably to the horror quotient.Unfortunately, Savini's skills aren't called upon very often here, and even when they are, the MPAA did a particularly thorough job of forcing much of Tom's artistry to linger on the cutting room floor. Only a couple of scenes recall the gravitas of Savini's most infamous work, and while it's certainly not his fault that his creations were so severely neutered, his name in the credits writes a check that the heavily-trimmed final product can't cash.Still, the film does deliver some grotesque elements, and it's far bloodier than its predecessor. It's also a bit more twisted in its own quirky way, and Leatherface's amorous attachment to Caroline Williams provides some demented moments that are almost uncomfortable to laugh at. The sequence where our hero presses his decidedly phallic chainsaw against Williams's crotch assuredly skirts the bounds of bad taste, but the scene that sticks out most in my mind is one in which he covers her face with the flayed skin of her friend and playfully dances with her in a room cluttered with severed body parts.Williams is excellent here, as is Hopper, who seems to be having a ball hamming it up and wringing every bit of mirth possible out of his one-dimensional archetype. Bill Johnson is equally fantastic as Leatherface, and he manages to convey a multi-faceted character through his nuanced grunts and facial expressions, no easy feat when all we see of him are his eyes and mouth.The sprawling subterranean set where the final action unfolds is an impressive and well-realized creation that provides an audaciously epic upgrade from the humble farmhouse in the first film. Dicey loopholes inevitably arise (if the family travels from place to place to keep their crimes undiscovered, would they really have hauled the body of Franklin, who they killed over a decade before, to their current location, where Hopper finds it?), but those who admire set decoration will have a lot of fun pausing the frames and taking in the vast minutiae on display in the background.The climax, where Hopper and Leatherface duke it out with dueling chainsaws like a pair of swashbucklers, is by far the most widely referenced aspect of the film. Most detractors point to this scene as the stupidest part of the movie, and they're clearly right. However, considering that the bulk of the film revels in a parody mindset, I actually can't think of a more fitting way for it to conclude.Yes, there clearly shouldn't have been a sequel to such a perfectly essayed snapshot of horror. But Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is an inherently enjoyable offering if you accept it on its own terms. There's no denying that it's an entertaining film, and since it practically announces its separation from the original from the opening frames, we can't accuse Tobe Hooper of failing to realize his vision, however skewed that vision might be.Give this troubled production another look, and, more importantly, give it a chance.

After the intensity of the original, that was probably impossible to top, Hooper decided to go with a comic leaning this time, some of it works some of it doesn't, but by the end i was just about persuaded it was fun. Hopper is naturally OTT, he doesn't quite sleepwalk through the film like others have stated, but he also doesn't really excel either. Caroline Williams constant screaming is more than slightly irksome and her playful musings with an impotent Leatherface are just silly, but its Bill Moseley you'll remember most from this film, he's a hoot.

After fourteen years, the chainsaw killers have relocated from south Texas to Dallas area, and are now ... wait for it, wait for it ... the most popular caterers in town, having even won an annual chili cook-off two years running, with their unique recipes of meat. When a couple of drunken, idiot college students crank call a late night disc jockey on a local radio station immediately before being sliced and diced by the chainsaw killers, and the DJ records audio of the killing (shades of Blow Out?) Enter Dennis Hopper who, while overacting outrageously, convinces her to play the tape of the killing on-air to draw the killers out into the open, against the advice of the station manager with the phlegm problem. Unfortunately, that's where the plot runs out, and, after a good first half, the pacing slows to a crawl in the second half, and it was also undermined by a rushed post-production schedule, which allegedly prevented further editing and effects-work. This was intended to be a satire of Motel Hell (which was a satire of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) complete with climactic dueling chainsaws, and the over-the-top slasher movies so popular in the 1980s, which is not entirely successful, but holds up better than a lot of the films from that time, and really captures the late night radio/ cable television feeling of the mid/ late 1980s. Our introduction to Chop-Top, both genuinely creepy and intentionally funny, was probably the best scene in the movie, very well done. It seems almost like something out of a David Lynch movie. The final scene has the heroine yelling and waving a chainsaw, after having dispatched the last(?) of the chainsaw family, just as Leatherface did at the end of the first movie. She had become exactly what she was fighting, and then, oddly, the movie ends with a bubbly little pop tune played over the closing credits, which should have been a sign to people that this was not intended to be taken seriously, as a straight sequel to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but basically a satire based on itself.

And you would have thought that Tobe and company would have had time to conjure up a worthy sequel. This time they'd have the money that would allow them just about anything they wanted to create on screen. But after watching this disaster, one cannot help but be reminded of the old adage that sometimes less is more.The original film was shot in four weeks under brutal conditions and with a budget that must have run in the tens of thousands of dollars. This time the scale is larger, and most of it obviously shot on actual sets. Tom Savini was on board to provide some disgusting gore that the original lacked. They even had an experienced star like Dennis Hopper to give top billing to. How could this film have missed? Well first of all, the tone is more comedic than frightening. This film is not at all frightening, nor does it seem to be trying to be. The original had a few moments that may have provided a chuckle or two, even if by accident. But it is painfully obvious that nobody is really that concerned with scaring the audience here. Even back then, they had to have known that gore alone is not scary. At the most it only provides the audience with discomfort. So this sequel lacks the suspense, the claustrophobic atmosphere, and basically all of the tension packed into the original. Not a good way to go, Mr. Hooper.The cast is not bad. You wish Hopper would have a more carefully defined role than that of just an ex(?)-lawman trying to avenge the death of the wheelchair-bound Franklin from part one. Hopper was seeing a career resurgence at this time, and maybe they just figured he'd provide even more zaniness as he battles Leatherface chain saw to chain saw. Hopper would go on to state that this was the worst film he ever made. Jim Siedow is the only returning cast member from part one, and gone is the edginess from his earlier performance. He and Bill Moseley are only going for laughs. Bill Johnson is an active and menacing Leatherface, but here he's made into too much of a sympathetic character by the third act. Caroline Williams is decent enough. She appears to have had a physically demanding role, and she sure knows how to scream.Go ahead and watch this film if you must. Especially since the Red River football weekend is coming up very soon! But by the time these creeps are chasing Ms. Williams around the bowels of a deserted amusement park, you will be disappointed. You will miss the tension, the atmosphere, and most importantly the scares from part one. Tobe Hooper's career had begun to slip by this point, and this film did him no favors. In fact the films of this series only seemed to get geometrically worse with each additional sequel or new meditation on the original idea. 4 of 10 stars.The Hound.

For a decade, Taxes Ranger Lefty Enright (Dennis Hopper) has been trying to chase down the cannibalistic Sawyer family that killed his brother Franklin 12 years ago. With no help from the local police. Lefty with the help of a local disk jockey, find the Sawyer's underground butcher shop and take matters into there own hands.Tope Hooper returns to the helm to tell another chilling story and the evil Leatherface and his overpowering chainsaw. The main story was written by L.M. Kit Carson and it was released by the now bankrupted company Cannon films. This film was banned in some country's for 20 years for it's gore and graphic violence, but only two people get killed by the chainsaw in this movie and it's gore isn't as bad as some of the other movies I've seen. The recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre made in 2006 was a lot worst then this, the gore which was shown in that film made this one look like it was G rated. But I guess they had different rules back in 1986 when this film was released to the public.The Taxes Chainsaw Massacre 2 isn't as good as the original. The bigger budget, cheap scares, length and it's comedy was the major flaws in this movie which could had been a lot better. The film does lag half way through once they enter the underground butcher shop. The ending which was also disappointing shows Leatherface having a chainsaw duel with Lefty which ends up with Leatherface coming out second best and the disk jockey doing Leatherface's famous chainsaw dance after she kills Chop Top.

Kit Carson's) sequel to the original horror classic, and is the cinematic equivalent of not sleeping for three days straight and then watching your favorite horror movie with a group of friends. You are not totally aware mentally, and everything washes over you in a new light, oftentimes with hilarious results.Yes, this time it is more comedy than horror, which I personally loved. While I hadn't seen the original at the time of seeing this entry, I was able to get right into the story.Basically, a radio host (the sexy Caroline Williams) and a Texas Ranger (Dennis Hopper... yes I said Dennis Hopper) who happens to be related to a couple of the victims from the original film try to contend with Leatherface and his cannibalistic (and dementedly hilarious) clan. Well, I mean, there is more to the plot than THAT, but overall, that is what's most important in this film.The film is a slow-build, and it really isn't until the halfway point that it picks up and maintains a steady spiral into oblivion. But don't think the movie boring- writer Carson injects quite a bit of life into the story, and makes the characters fun and very interesting to watch. He also has an ear for dialogue and knows how to make even the most minor of moments shine. Never before would I think a line of dialogue such as Hey, I built you a french-fry house! actually make me like a character and root for him, but Carson's quirky character and Hooper's fun direction make it happen.But no review of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is complete without a mention of the one character that everybody loves- Bill Moseley as Chop-Top, a supposed Vietnam Vet and brother of Leatherface (or, as we learn his real name, Bubba) with an exposed metal plate sticking out of his head (supposedly from a war-wound) and sickly pale skin. Yes, Chop-Top has some of the most amazing and gut-busting lines of dialogue I have ever heard, and Moseley shows his talent for acting, making him horrifying and hilarious at the same time. One of the best things to happen to Horror-Comedies ever.There are plenty of surprises in the story to keep you reeling, and great silly performances by talents like Hopper. Basically, once this movie gets going, it sucks you right in and won't let go.Oh, and it also has some great gore, and superb performances by the likes of Bill Johnson as Leatherface and Jim Siedow as the Cook Drayton Sawyer, among others.I can't help myself with this one- an 8 out of 10!

At first I couldn't see where Tobe Hooper was coming from. It took him 11 years to come up with a sequel and what he has made does not compare to the original, in the way of FEAR! No, he definitely played this for laughs and it shows, but tried to make up for it by employing Tom Savini to pile on the gore and Dennis Hopper for comedy value. Having said this I did enjoy it. The little nutcase with the coat hanger was suitably f**ked up (quite a good scene with him and the DJ when they first meet). Leatherface this time round was by no means scary! What really bugged me was his impression of a limbo dancer every time he'd smash through a wall or a door, close to his victim. This is a silly little sequel, but well worth watching. I read the review of this from the Radio Times which I usually find pretty good value. They view this film with very high regard &#150; very odd. When you first start reading it it's as if your reading a review of Apocalypse Now or something.

"},{"Title":"Sawing into Stardom","Date":"7 December 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" This sequel, unlike the original classic, was like an acid trip with extra acid. Not that I'm saying it was horrible or that it was the best thing to hit horror cinema, what I am saying is that it seemed a bit too cheesy and b-movie-ish. It wasn't scary as much as it was disturbing, but at the same time it seemed like a comedy and there were many points where it was a bit too over the top. The acting was descent, the cinematography (special effects and lighting) where way over the top, the plot was worn out and the scares were replaced by some good laughs. It was not the original and it had far more impossibilities than any other Tobe Hooper film I have seen. In this case, Texas Chainsaw 2 was okay and worth watching.First off, the acting was okay, it wasn't Oscar worthy but it certainly wasn't the worst acting I have seen. Bill Moseley, who plays Chop Top, does a real good performance capturing the demented and mentally damaged war veteran who has an obsession of transforming the theme park into NamLand. Ken Evert, was okay and did a somewhat good job recapturing the personality of the grandpa from the original, but in this movie he ads a bit more comic relief (i.e. the people he cuts up is used for award winning Chile). Dennis Hooper, whom I'm surprised to see, did a fairly silent and random character that is out for revenge. Now, giving the fact he was brilliant in Easy Rider, this film was a step below his acting career. In the movie he seems a bit over the top (when he goes nuts with the chainsaws), and at points seemed as if he did this for fun. In this film, Leatherface was not a maniac that had faces resemble his personality, but seemed more like a young boy who has fallen in love and throws temper tantrums. This reworking of Leatherface, to me, proved to be a disaster and a step below the personality of the original killer.The plot is vastly different from the original; basically a radio hostess hears a brutal murder over the phone and is later kidnapped by the very same cannibalistic family. A renegade cop searching for redemption is proved to find the culprits even if it means destroying the entire place with duel chainsaws in a spaghetti western style showdown. However, some of the stuff that could have been vastly scary or disturbing turned out to be a bit funny and gross. They try to bring back that iconic scene from the original with the old man and the hammer, but this one backfired and proved to be comic rather than horrific. Some things that made this plot line seem a bit too unnatural was the use of some extreme impossibilities that was used in this film. Examples like standing up on a car and killing people in the other vehicle with chainsaw, a skinless man walking and talking and having two huge chainsaws hanging from a belt. They seemed so cheesy and out of the blue that it was enjoyable. It was just way different from the original and I guess that is okay.The one thing that I really like that the other one did not have was the extreme use of camera angles, lighting and tone of the film. These aspects were so over the top that it made up for some of the poor audio and music. The lighting, especially at night, were very colorful and high contrast and seemed to have come straight out of a comic book. In the radio building there was a high contrast of shadowy reds when Moseley's character appears, even higher tones of red and splashes of green when Leatherface appears. In numerous hallways there was dim lighting with obtuse red, green, yellow and blue shapes and oranges in the main dining hall. I think that by utilizing the lights, it really made this movie atmospheric and haunting. The camera angels (mostly seen in the radio station) where amazing and uses a wide variety of zooms and pans. Some of the best pans and trucks were seen in the cave where this family lives and one the best zooms is when it zooms out of the dinner table and the girls is crying. With the camera angles, this movie had a bit of a zest to it that I don't see that often in movies of this magnitude.Overall, this movie was not the worst thing I have ever seen, nor was it the best thing I have ever seen. There was an equal balance of good and bad aspects of this film ranging from bad acting to excellent cinematography and it had a vastly different plot, but was executed wrongly. I enjoyed this film mainly because it was different that your average cannibalistic family tale, this one seemed a bit more on edge and acid driven. Of coarse, it did not frightened me the way I initially hoped, but it did strike me as being very theatrically disturbing and seemed as if it came from the mind of a drugged out hippie. I would recommend this film to any horror fan, partly because its trip and an experience that I think al horror fanatics should be aware of. It's one of those movies it's famous for being famous, and the first of its kind in along sad history of Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequels. (I hated Texas Chainsaw Next Generation). It's just a fun and wacky film that nobody should miss. "},{"Title":"Crazy, gross, funny - Tobe Hooper all the way","Date":"8 August 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":"  OK, so it's not the first one. But how could it be? Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is the CITIZEN KANE of horror movies; you don't top that. What this movie does, though, is it takes its crazy ideas and wacks you over the head with them; it goes all the way, and then some. That's the Hooper hallmark. Playing the movie for obvious laughs works to make it even more disturbing. The jokes play against the gruesome carrying on; this is a world gone mad because nothing, and I mean nothing makes sense. We're beyond surreal; we're through the looking glass; which, I think, is Hooper's intention. Stretch falls down the hole - it's not a rabbit hole, and she doesn't meet the mad hatter. But what she does experience is a world that questions sense and sanity. The reason most find this one less satisfying then the first is because it's not seamless; we can see Hooper's gears turning and, unlike the first time, we're actually in on the joke. That aside, Hooper's directorial vision remains consistent. It's not a story, per se, we are following, it's a chase, and we're running, running, running like mad. Hooper seems to have an unerring ability to get inside the crazies that populate his movies. These weird, disastrous, antisocials he creates have dimensional life; and it's all their own. We follow their thinking, their thought process, and in doing so, the irrational in his movies becomes logical. This is his gift. When he works on material like CROCODILE, where the monster is not in some way human, the work stutters and spits. Hooper's mad men are scary because they are human, and their humanity is cleverly displayed. Remember Neville Brand's nutty soliloquies in EATEN ALIVE? Brilliant, I thought. Massacre 2 knows it's being funny, and the surprise we felt in the first one is all but lost. This time, though, instead of surprise, we find ourselves tumbling down the rabbit's hole and we end up with more than we bargained for. Chop Top is one of the weirdest, wildest, funniest, monsters ever put on the screen. Bill Mosley's performance shoots off into areas few actors even know about, much less enter. He is gross, funny, and frightening all at the same time. The crazy things he says are like DaDa ravings; he's the irrational made flesh. Jim Siedow weaves back and forth between rationality and the exact opposite with little or no warning. In truth, he looks like he's on the verge of breaking up throughout the entire movie. The scene where Stretch finds herself tied to a chair at the head of this wildly long table is one of Hooper's finest moments. The entire scene is one long take with the camera tracking into Stretch and then back out over the table, then back in to her, then, yet again, we track back out beyond the table, with Siedow raving on like a mad Baptist minister. The tracking, swooping camera, constantly changing our perspective, creates an almost lyrical sense of grandeur in this mad, mad world; Hooper has let us in on the joke, but he surprises us with such effects because we feel, with the Sawyer clan, the power and drive of their subterranean mania.Hooper is an extraordinary director. Even when his work misses, there's a power to it. In some way or other he understands what it is to be a lunatic, and his major movies, this one included, celebrates the hysteria while putting us non-lunatics through the ringer.

So you know where I stand, I enjoyed TCM 74, give it a 7/10. It has its ups and downs. I haven't seen TCM3 or 4, but I think the 'remake', if you want to call it that, is one of the greatest horror films of all time.Basically, this film is the crackhead version of the original. I'll use and analogy I thought up while watching TCM2 to help you better understand it.Imagine two brothers, of about college age in the 70's, one somewhat intelligent, the other I see in my head as being like Brian from 'Half Baked.' Anyways, the intelligent brother writes 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and knows it has flaws, but still is a good amateur work. So he decides he will read the script to his brother one night, and see what he thinks. However, his brother is heavily intoxicated, and as the script is read to him, he's not absorbing very much of it. When brother 1 done reading, he asks his brother 2's opinion. Not remembering much, and being to embarrassed to say 'read it again', he just says 'that was good' and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is born. Assuming brother #2 still hasn't seen the movie, we'll jump 1986. Bored one night, while trippin' on acid, brother #2 decides he'll re-write what he remembers of his brother's story. He spends all night writing, and comes up with 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2'.Now that you have the general idea, I'll break it down piece by piece. Tobe Hooper wrote and directed both films. He made TCM2 because he felt no one saw TCM for what he wanted it to be. It was supposed to be a comedy, but people found it scary rather than funny. So Hooper figured he'd show everyone what he was trying just so everything is properly expressed. Many of the scenes are reminiscent of the original, and the dinner scene is all but completely replicated. The characters have changed for the weirder. Chop Top is a crazier more perverted version of the hitchhiker. He's just the tag along, but still is interested by everything his two brothers do. Drayton is about the same, maybe a little more adventurous. Leatherface is however, very emotional, gets confused easier, is much more childish, and is surprisingly portrayed as the 'nice guy' out of the group. He actually helps the heroin escape.One thing that really stuck out is how this film is much more graphic than the original. It makes you realize how clean the original really is. Anybody who ever found it shocking, this film exploits how it was all in you head. You get out of the original what you put in, and that's probably why most people find the original boring. I was just surprised to hear the characters using profanity, seeing gore, hearing sexual innuendos, it didn't seem to fit the TCM atmosphere. The gore wasn't graphic, the language wasn't strong, and the sexuality wasn't to perverted, but it all stands out.In conclusion, I'd say I enjoyed the film, but most people wouldn't because it's the 'so stupid its cool' thing. I can compare it to Jack Frost, although I hated Jack Frost. The humor isn't that dull though, there's a little more substance to it. Some aspects don't line up with the original's story, as the hitchhiker is still alive, the home has been relocated, the MO's are different, etc, but if you can just chuckle and say 'whatever' you'll enjoy checking out this flick. Nothing special, but interesting.

He made me laugh out loud when Leatherface hits his plate and Mosely croaches on the floor screaming, VIET NAM FLASH BACK! VIET NAM FLASH BACK!  That was SUPER funny!

This is the classic Prometheus versus the Minotaur in the Labrynth scenario.  You will find that many horror movies use this premise.  The best adaption of this premise in a horror movie is the original ALIEN.  In this movie, Stretch (who is hot) is lost in this abysmal labrynth, a long intertwined maze of tunnels full of horrors and inhabited by The Family. Leatherface, Choptop, Chilly dad, and Grandpa are in there and they have the distinct advantage of knowing the ins and outs of that place.  Through this maze Stretch is hunted down and exposed to various trials and horrors. The psychologist Sigmund Freud was particularly fascinated by this mythic scenario and stated that the Minotaur Maze comes from deep within the human psyche.  It is a way our subconscious deals with the trials of daily survival and lifetime adaptation as we mature.At the end of the movie, we are treated to a display of complete disregard for proper operating instructions concerning the chainsaw.  Dennis Hopper does battle with Leatherface, chainsaw versus chainsaw, and they hack away at eachother as if they had swords.  I think the chain would probably break! I thought of the old swashbuckling movies as the two of them did battle on top of the dinner table.  Leatherface again does his pattented chainsaw side-to-side dance and it proves to be the death of him.  Because Dennis Hopper, instead of dancing, siezes the moment to stab the chainsaw ALL THE WAY THROUGH Leatherface.  However, Leatherface continues to fight!  He is hard core!And, of course, to round out the pyschological terror and make some sort of character arc, at the end, Stretch masters the chainsaw and uses it to kill Choptop.  In fact, after killing Choptop, she does a little chainsaw dance of her own!Now, I will comment on part of the movie that really impressed me! Choptop's death scene.  I am refering to what appears to be one heck of a great STUNT!  Choptop falls off the top of a tower and ROLLS down a SUPER STEEP ROCK FACE and directly in to a METAL TUBE.  This fall appears to be about 20 or 25 feet.  I was IMPRESSED!  This did not look like a dummy! That looked like a STUNT GUY did that STUNT!  Anybody ever try to do their own stunts?  Let me tell you, that looked SCARY!  If you don't SMASH YOUR BRAINS ON THE ROCK, then you will most likely SLAM in to the corner of that tube!  You have to hit it just right, and that stunt guy rolled over BACKWARDS on his way DOWN!  That is amazing!  If that was indeed a stunt, and not a dummy, I am super impressed.  It looked like a real stunt guy, so I am going with that.  But it appears to be such a scary stunt, I don't know where they found a stunt guy to do it!  It seems like kind of a shame, because that scene is over so quick and no one seems to care about that stunt.  That was a good stunt!Overall, this is a fun horror movie.  I laughed a lot, but it has some really disturbing parts too!  Such as the part with Grandpa trying to brain poor Stretch.  That was disturbing.  Not exactly a date movie.  Also the weird part where Leatherface chainsaws beer cans and sprays Stretch with chainsawed beer.  That was just strange.  If you have a sense of humor, you will probably be entertained by this movie.

It worked well as a sequel and was worthy of the TCM name.  They should have left the franchise alone after that and never produced the train wreck that was TCM 3.  I haven't even seen part 4 yet.  I understand it is pretty horrible.  I will probably buy it anyway just to complete the set.  But I digress.  This thread is about TCM 2.  Great horror movie with a healthy splash of comedy.  Very worthy to follow up TCM and carry its name. Dennis Hopper was cheesey as hell but absolutely perfect.  Caroline Williams was the perfect horror movie hotty, although she screamed too much.  Even Leatherface was pretty good.  Bill Johnson managed to carry himself in much the same way as Gunnar Hanson.  Jim Siedow was absolutely great reprising his role as Drayton Sawyer.  The movie probably would not have worked without him.  My only gripes are as follows.  How the hell did the hitch hiker survive getting run over?  I thought it was pretty clear that he was dead at the end of the first one.  Although I did like the character in this one.  And how did Grandpa get so much more energy in this one?

Down here in Australia it is actually banned (which is ludicrous) and the majority of horror buffs haven't been able to see it (not everyone imports).What bothers me is that the rest of the world spits and curses all over this film. Why? They say it shows us what the original only lets us imagine..... so what? Didnt most of you see the original for the first time expecting to see the violence?Yes, yes, I agree that the absense of blood and gore in the original was it's main strengh. However, the formula was exorcised and executed... time to move on to the next chapter.... which is probably more disturbing when you watch it properly. I mean, the blatent use of gore and the insane humour which it's delivered with is very disturbing.The character of the 'father' is probably closer related to Ed Gein than what he was in the original... and seeing as they attribute the inspiration for TCM from Ed Gein, It would suggest to me that this second film is a success! The character of 'Chop-Top' adds to the disturbance of the film even more. His over the top sense of humour is greatly misjudged. As a viewer, his irritating and immature ranting and raving makes me feel very uneasy. While we have one character feeling violated and blood-caked on the ground, we have Chop-Top standing over them prancing around like a child, relishing every suffering moment.This is a highly original film (for it's time) and a very worthy follow up. Do not rate this movie in comparison with the original film.... both aim to shock the audience from different angles... and if viewed correctly, this one should hit you right in the jugular.I rate this film 7 corpses out of 10.

An opinion is one thing, I have one, you have one - we all do... but what about the people who seem to take it too far, too serious. That was the case with this movie I do believe. People dogged it and killed it in reviews, it was a great horror movie, what were you expecting GONE WITH THE WIND?The first movie came out in 1974 introducing the world to Leatherface, chainsaw slaughter, hillbilly hobbies and the vision of Tobe hooper. None of which impressed me much, I did have a bit of a place in my heart for Bubba Leatherface Sawyer - still think he is one of the best things to happen to horror films. Tobe Hooper, however is not something I feel that's added much to horror, in fact Texas chainsaw and its impact WERE all that anyone felt from him. FUNHOUSE, INVADERS FROM MARS, LIFEFORCE were all dull and forgettable and POLTERGEIST was a perfect film, but it's so obvious that Spielburg directed that film just let Tobe hold the camera. I have watched almost every film of Tobe's in the last couple days with the exception of the 3 I don't have. I decided that I wanted to watch different directors; Raimi, Carpenter, Craven, P. Jackson, Romero, etc. and try to feel which one really spoke to me most - just as far as direction goes, not story or anything else, but enjoying everything about it as I watch.TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 was one of the first movies I ever bought back in the very late eighties or early 90's. One of the first 10 movies I bought and now I have thousands - so maybe it holds a place in my heart for that fact, all I know is I like it alot.Tobe's direction is nothing amazing as I expected, but don't get me wrong he's not bad, just simply not unique. The story was not scary but not many films are. Gunnar admitted that when he played Leatherface in the first film that he based him on a mentally retarded person. Given a fact like that and seeing how his family were hillbilly lunatics it was hard to take it very seriously, so when I hear people complain about part two being more funny I have to argue that that was the only way to make it. If they had tried to make Leatherface really mean it would've been totally unbelieveable. His murder skills and madness were taught to him, he simply didn't know any better, so making him a killjoy slasher would've been wrong.The cast of this movie was great. The guy with the metal plate in his head was wonderful - All you Primus fans out there might remember the song Jerry was a Race Car Driver from the SAILING THE SEAS OF CHEESE album in 1991 where a sample of Chop Top saying Dog will hunt can be heard. I am sad Gunnar Hansen didnt play Leatherface in it, but the guy who did wasn't so bad. Dennis Hopper in this movie is still somewhat of a shock to me, but he was great in it. The female dj Stretch is not a very familiar face, even though I have seen her in a few other horrors - is it just me or does she remind you of Laurie Metcalf (Jackie from ROSEANNE).Last but definatley not least the wonderful Jim Siedow (Drayton Sawyers), he was in the first Texas massacre also and just really has more depth than any one person from these movies. I can say I don't wan't to taste his chili though, made of only the finest human meat. Draytons encounter with Lefty (Hopper) will be one he, nor his ass will ever forget.The battlefields and radio station and even the bridge made for great settings. Fun to watch all the murder and chases and such go on there and if nothing else watch this movie to see people sword-like fighting with huge chainsaws - Thats Entertainment!With all that said and out of the way I will get back to my original point about this being a horror movie, a sequel at that, given an X rating for violence and it's a slasher movie - some of us like it, some like me, love them. When I go to buy a horror and it shows a guy holding a chainsaw on the box, I know what Im getting, I go home and I enjoy it - some are better than others, some downright SUCK! but I knew what I was getting and didnt expect it to be a life changing film.I am sick and tired of people dogging horror movies. It never stops....You know if it cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make and is directed by James Cameron that it's gonna be massive, you know if Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks is in it that it's gonna be massive, and you also know that when you get a movie like this what you are about to watch, so if you know you're going to hate it, then don't watch it and come here and put it down, unless youre a horror movie fan and have earned the right.FREDDY V/S JASON, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 and movies like that have lead the box office this year - so maybe critics, movie companies and everyone will see that horror is what the fans want and have always wanted.

You know the type bad skin, bad teeth and that look about them that makes Darwin's entire theory flash by in a nanosecond.But as gross, disturbing and slightly shocking as TCM2 can be, there is one point I can't get past. Bubba and family aren't anything beyond creepy, de-evolved cannibals. They don't have powers, they aren't killing via dreams; they aren't able to absorb bullets and come back to life. This isn't like the first movie where it is teens or whatever that are in the middle of nowhere and are stuck at their little fortress of human nutrition; rather there are 2 people who both end up in the Leatherface stronghold by seeking it out. Unarmed. No police. Well, Dennis Hopper ends up bringing a weapon a chainsaw. 3 of them. Disturbing he may be, but if you think about it a well thrown rock would be enough to disable Mr. Leatherface and his 65 year old father. A 12 year old with a modicum of common sense, a .38 snub nose and 6 bullets could have sunk 2 in each of the bad guys in this movie, and there wouldn't have been any coming back to life or whatever other supernatural power you can muster. I can't help but think of this as I watch it, and therefor I have no sympathy for the broad that ends up terrorized, nor am I impressed by Mr. Hopper's Ramboesque infiltration and destruction of the underground lair etc. etc. That alone makes this a very dumb, dumb movie, but hey maybe I was in a particularly bad mood as I watched it.

Taking the cast of killers from TCM and supplanting them in the hypocritical, amoral, success-crazed America of the 1980's, Tobe Hooper uses cannibalism as a metaphor for capitalism (a feat accomplished just as successfully several years later by Wes Craven's superb satire The People Under the Stairs) and takes the guns out of the hands of the vengeful (if not thoughtful) cowboys of the USA and replaces them with chainsaws. This is a larger than life world where ambition takes the place of reason, pop-culture replaces the idea and the moral are more destructive than their flesh-eating, chilli-cooking, radio-blasting quarry. The film is the great landscape on which the battle between good and evil takes place, though neither role is so simply defined. The good Texas Ranger seeking justice proves to be completely ineffectual or inadvertantly malignant, while his opponents (which include the moneyhungry cook from TCM, an insane former-hippy-cum-war-veteran music lover, the love-crazed manchild Leatherface and, finally, Grandpa and the Hitchhiker from TCM named Nubbins, both of which are of dubious vitality) are so steeped in madness that their (often unsuccessful) acts of malice take on a playful, insanely logical quality that can hardly be deemed evil. Amidst this sea of chaos are a small town Radio DJ looking to make it big and her smitten, ill-fated cohort, destined for slaughter or stardom. The great battle takes place at an abandoned amusement park where brutal battles were once re-enacted and celebrated.

Fair enough, sequels can bring some addition to a movie experience, even though most sequels (at least in my view) fail to live up to their originals. This is not one of the good sequels.In The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, we meet Dennis Hopper as the near-deranged and vengeful Texas Marshall, who uses a local radio DJ (Caroline Williams) to find the murderous family from the original film. If you call that a storyline, then sure. I call it nonsense.After watching this hack-and-slash-blood-spurting-everywhere feast, I felt quite sick to my stomach. I was however never the least bit scared. The movie is littered with gorey details I hesitate even to write about, and this initially has some shock effect. But after a while even that disappears. You -however horrible this may sound- become used to seeing people mutilated, covered in blood or eaten as supper every two seconds for the films duration to the point that it becomes boring. All that is left is a feeling of nausea, paired with the depressing thought that people actually spent time and effort making this movie.Qualities? Well... Dennis Hopper is in it. I guess that is about the only good thing I can think of, although you should NOT watch this movie hoping for a normal Hopper performance. He, like everything else in this film, is just pale and insignificant compared to the generous serving of blood and violence.As I recall, my first thought after having seen this movie was This is the sickest thing I have ever seen. I suppose that warrants some sort of recognition. I do not disapprove of movie violence, nor am I a stranger to watching horror films. I feel that violence and shock effects can be quite effective- after all, its better just to see it on screen rather than people experiencing it in real life. I have seen plenty of violent and brutal movies as well as more subtle horror in my day. But this movie has no justifications for its violence, other than that it somewhat takes your concentration off the bad acting and lack of story. To sum it up- you are better off not having seen this movie, and the only reason to see it is so that you can tell your fourteen-year-old friends that you have seen it. No-one else will be impressed- more likely depressed on your behalf.I will however make a recommendation if you are looking for something violent with a humorous twist paired with a healthy dose of self-distance, I heartily recommend Lord of the Rings-director Peter Jackson's Braindead (1992).

The Sawyer family from the original slasher/horror classic are back, and they've moved out of the old house and tackled the food industry as entrepreneurs of their own brand of `special' meat.  Caroline Williams plays `Stretch,' a tough-chic disc jockey who becomes involuntarily involved with the deranged Sawyer's activities when an almost-equally-deranged ex-Texas Ranger named `Lefty' (the vengeful uncle of Sally and Franklin from the first film) uses her as bait to lead him to the cannibal family's secret, underground lair. Once the bloody mayhem starts, it does not let up until the final credits. It's as if Hooper wanted to make up for the lack of blood and guts in the original TCM by absolutely saturating this one with it.  You get chainsaw duels (as in Motel Hell), chainsaws searing heads in half, chainsaws used as phallic symbols, heads battered repeatedly with hammers, people skinned alive, and more.  Dennis Hopper, as `Lefty,' delivers one of B-movie cinema's all-time hammiest, all-stops-out performances, worthy of Vincent Price or Oliver Reed in one of his more outlandish roles.  Scenes of Hopper charging down tunnels and cutting through support beams with a giant chainsaw while madly yelling, `I am the reaper of the harvest!' are priceless.  Jim Siedow (the only returning cast member from the original) is also hilarious and gets most of the movie's best lines as Drayton Sawyer, or `Pa' to his rambunctious boys, the family cook and unsuccessful damage controller.  While the original TCM is one of the best modern horror movies of our time, this rambunctious sequel is notable on an entirely different level.  My only big criticism is that Hooper repeats a scene or two from the original too closely (particularly the scene with Grandpa trying to hang onto the mallot long enough to give poor `Stretch' a good whack on the noggin).  Otherwise, this is good, gruesome fun as long as you don't take any of it too seriously.  Hooper's horror movies have seriously declined since this one.HIGHLIGHT  Leatherface (Bill Johnson) falls in love (you heard me) with `Stretch,' and as a token of his feelings, he strips the face off of her still-breathing co-worker L.G. (Lou Perry) and forces his new girlfriend to wear it over her own face.  The scene of L.G. staring in misery and confusion at his own face on another person is pretty disturbing, and it paved the way for a similar face-skinning-and-wearing scene in The Silence of the Lambs.

Their newfound success may be cut short, however, by crazed Texas lawman Dennis Hopper, out to avenge his niece and nephew who were tortured and/or murdered 12 years earlier. Pretty much dismissed by critics and audiences alike upon its initial release, this bizarre, offbeat horror-comedy has developed a rigorous cult following over the years, and has slowly been rediscovered by many who ignored it earlier. Filled with sarcastic jokes lampooning America's obsession with pop culture, social status, war and violence, the movie is a far cry from the terrifying (and only subtly satiric) original. While it's uneven and doesn't always work, it's still a unique horror movie and well worth reconsideration.

While the original TCM had very little blood, TCM2 carries it in abundance.  There's plenty to go around.  While hated by many, this film manages to be very entertaining and somehow, easier to sit through than its predecessor.  Tobe Hooper took a very tongue-in-cheek approach to this sequel, and while it may have been a strange decision, it does manage to work.... most of the time. While I laughe often, I think what really made the movie work was Dennis Hopper's out-there portrayel of a lawman who no longer has anything left to lose and is hell-bent on getting revenge on the cannibalistic clan who murdered his invalid nephew (Franklin) and drove his niece to the nuthouse, then to suicide.  His whacked-out, sometimes over-the-top performance won me over big time and I was cheering him on all the way through.Last but not least, Bill Moseley as Chop-top was very amusing.

Given the generally low quality of genre films from the period, especially sequels, that's not usually saying a whole lot. Nonetheless, despite its flaws, it's certainly worth the effort for horror fans. It's not as good as the original that is asking too much; it was an unique, one-of-a-kind film, one that is perhaps best left alone. Still, the sequel does not tarnish its memory. On the contrary, it revitalizes the concept with a fresh approach. Director Tobe Hooper realized that even he would be hard-pressed to outdo his own groundbreaking film, so he wisely takes the material in a whole new direction altogether. The first Massacre was a grim, bleak horror film; the second is an over-the-top dark comedy. There's much more gore than the original, but it's so bizarre and frenetic that it's impossible to take seriously. It's done with so much panache that we can't help but hop on and go along for the ride. The funny thing about it is that it actually does a decent job of making Leatherface sympathetic. This odd plot thread starts with a symbolic chainsaw/phallic symbol sequence that is absolutely priceless; it's intense and bizarre, the way a TCM film should be. So the guy's not evil, just misunderstood? That's right, and it works. He is actually capable of thinking of another human being as more than just fodder for the meat-grinder. No wonder this guy is killing people; it's his only outlet for sexual frustration. Makes sense, in light of some of his father's comments.What can I say about the acting? It's all over-the-top, like the movie itself. You get to see an insane Dennis Hopper in a chainsaw duel with Leatherface; how can you go wrong with that? Absurd, but compelling in a bizarre way. Hopper can always be counted on to spice up a movie, and he certainly doesn't let us down, although he's equally effective in his quieter moments. Likewise, Jim Siedow and Bill Johnson are clearly enjoying themselves as members of the nuttiest family on the planet, and Bill Moseley is so uninhibited it's surreal. In contrast, Caroline Williams provides a center of normalcy as the heroine--until she also loses it all in the end.This is not an unqualified recommendation, though. the first half-hour is fairly tedious, with little action to break the monotony. I know that some scenes were removed for time and content reasons, but the film does suffer for that. From what I hear, they originally depicted some more Leatherface action, which will hopefully find its way into a future special edition. As it is, the film is rough going at first, then it thankfully picks up with a terrifying sequence. From that point on, the pace rarely flags, although it gets a bit exhausting after a while.

The film appears far too 'polished' compared to its predecessor, which was renowned for its grainy and dark visuals.Many people actually perceived the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' as a kind of macabre sort-of-comedy. In fact, I remember when it was finally released in the UK a few years ago; I was one of the only people squeezed into a small local cinema who wasn't laughing at it. To be honest I found the killings in 'TCSM' rather harrowing. Perhaps many thought it was funny to see 'Leatherface' blunder about the place making a bizarre series of (what can best be described as) 'squeals'!Tobe Hooper appears to have picked up on that particular trend and 'TCSM 2' is a decidedly postmodern film; comprising of many elements from the original and several other horror films. It is indeed a type of pastiche yet it contains too much comedy to be labelled so. The fact that it seems to be mocking itself and its predecessor means that it is parodic.Also, unlike the original, the killings in 'TCSM 2' are shown in their full splendour. While Hooper opted to use a series of close-up shots of people being killed in 'TCSM', here, we are not denied that privilege. The opening killing where a man has the top of his head sliced off with a chainsaw just goes to prove this and the fact that this wound results in blood spraying almost relentlessly is quite disturbing, if not somewhat hilarious.    I didn't give this film a particularly high grade ('5') but it isn't as bad as some people have made out; at the same time though, it isn't a patch on the original. The film is alive with cheesy one-liners and harsh language. Jim Siedow's performance as 'Cook' is goofily amusing. I agree with some other people who have commented on this film; Dennis Hopper is adequate enough but he appears to be out-of-place. It's a real shame that Gunnar Hansen (who I had the pleasure of meeting 2 years ago) wasn't playing 'Leatherface'.

Both films were inspired by/loosely based on the murderer Ed Gein and both hold up a dark mirror to the conventional all-American family.  The second murder in Psycho, which is more startling and horrific than the infamous initial murder, was stylistically the template for the initial batch of killings in Texas..  About a dozen years after Texas. director Tobe Hooper returned to make it's first sequel that, alas, has more in common with the typical horror franchise sequel than its two previously mentioned forebears.The film opens with two idiotic young men travelling by car to a party in Dallas.  A number of makeshift roadsigns they pass and shoot, advertise 'museums/theme parks' based on savage military battles fought in the titular state e.g. the Alamo.  This is a nice touch, depicting slaughter as cultural entertainment and hinting that the states history (all history in fact) is based on killing.  OK back to the film's premise, the two goons fail to reach their destination but their fate is overheard and recorded by a local radio DJ whom they were pestering via a phone-in.  The next day at the 'accident' site, Dennis Hopper (of all people) turns up as a vigilante policeman out to avenge his siblings who died in the first film.  He teams up with the DJ to locate the killers.  Guess who does the searching?The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part II is a mixture of the good and the bad. Only Hooper himself could have got away with ripping off his classic to such a degree.  Some of the scenes and dialogue are lifted almost unchanged from the original.  The film ups the gore quotient considerably (good) and the number of chainsaws, to the point of fetishism, compared to the original. But to the films detriment the atmosphere, menace and violence of the first are much diminished.  Most of the film occurs in one of the aforementioned theme parks, a setting too fantastic and unreal compared to the original's run-down farmhouse (everyone knows some local desolate, run-down building). The 'cannibals' are portrayed in a comedic light, which dispels the sense of their perversion and evil so evident formerly.  The `Cook' (note all the characters have nicknames) and `Chop-Top' (who I 'assume' was in Vietnam when the first film occurred) babble on endlessly - at times amusing, but mostly annoying or incoherently.*spoilers to end*The worst victim of this volte-face is `Leatherface'.  Formerly he was a grunting vortex of destruction savagely wielding his saw with impunity and no concern for personal safety  (OK he still wields it well but spends too much time harmlessly sawing up furniture.  On a similar note, Lefty's chainsaw shenanigans were pitiable.  How many scenes were there of him sawing through wooden supports with no resulting damage to the 'caverns' infrastructure?).  This time round `Leatherface' is more like a lovesick bear, what with his forlorn eyes rolling about.  The 'Beauty and the Beast' aspect is quite appalling.  At what point did he fall for the girl exactly? Was it when he came smashing out of the record vault (love at first sight) or (my hunch) when she fired CO2 into his maw?Now for some good points.  There are some memorable setpieces especially the initial chainsaw attack.  The puppet-like corpse wielding the saw on the top of the pick-up is both surreal and eerie.  Whose corpse was it exactly, I thought `Hitch's' cadaver might make an appearance as a few bodies from the original have cameo appearances.  The DJ's initial confrontation with `Chop-Top' was also memorable.  He turns up like a loopy fan or stalker at the radio station - any public figure's worst nightmare.  His dialogue here is his best in the film, both amusing and filled with menace.  His request for Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida is suitably off-kilter.  All eighteen minutes of it, no hope on a commercial radio station, but she did play `Lefty's' 'request' so perhaps he thought he might be in with a chance.*big spoilers*Finally having an explosion to wipe out most of the film's players is just lazy storytelling and filmmaking.  Anyone could have come up with something better.  Thankfully, the closing image of the 'victor' triumphant on the 'fake mountain' whirling the chainsaw in madness is effective.  This hints at a potential starting point for Part III, which I have not seen but I don't think was advanced upon.  `Dog eat dog'.

While part 1 was trying to give you a raw terror inducing feel, director Tobe Hooper decided to go for a more tightly paced, blackly humorous, gore extravaganza this time around.  Which I must say, IMO, was a good decision by Mr. Hooper.I just cannot see why anyone would pick the original over this classic 80's horror/comedy.  Dennis Hopper does an excellent job as Lt.

Worst ending ever.","Date":"16 October 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":"  I will admit, right now, that I'm not the biggest fan of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I've always been more of an Evil Dead/Romero's Dead series kind of guy. To me, it was one of those movies with lots of hype, and lots of fans. The movie I had constructed in my mind was far more gory, violent, and detailed in terms of both character and plot. The actual movie was shallow, if interesting, with not a whole lot more than some talented direction holding it together. Then there was the second. With a chainsaw-wielding Dennis Hopper on the back of the box, I decided to give it a chance. Based on what I had heard, I thought perhaps it was more of what I had wanted from the first. I was almost right. First off, I'll give credit to Hooper for two things. One is the direction. He knows how to effectively and stylishly handle a movie. There's a reason Speilberg brought him on for Poltergiest. With some incredible set design, it's an amazing movie to look at.    The second thing Hooper did right was hire Tom Savini, horror make-up genius. The work he does, while limited, is wonderful. Sure, his talents are on better display in Day of the Dead, from the year before, but this is quite a work-out. The scene with the...mask...is disturbing, ugly, and beautifully executed. Even if you hate the scene, the effects work is top-quality. Then there are the problems. The story is thin. It was thin in the first, but this one tries to make you care. It tries to create a few characters. That was something the first didn't come close to doing. Unfortunately, they aren't anything special. Hopper is fun, but he obviously wasn't willing to work more than a few days. I assume he did it for it's potential as a cult-classic. The villains are goofy, but not too scary. Still, they add to the cartoonish feeling. And then there's the end. What happened? Were left with a rushed, confused, partial end. I won't spoil it for anyone, but it doesn't cover the bases it needs to. It negates most of the fun I had with the rest of the movie. And there was some fun to be had. After all, any movie that has Chainsaw dueling between Dennis Hopper and Leatherface has to be worth at least one viewing.

Soon the host finds herself being held by the cannibal family and gaining the affections of Leatherface.THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 is probably one of the most hated sequels in the history of cinema. It was released with a lot of hype but pretty much died at the box office and it got a beating from fans and critics. Those expecting anything like the original are bound to be disappointed but once you accept that this is more of a comedy than a horror film and you view it on its own merits, the film really isn't all that bad. It's certainly an incredibly flawed film but at the same time I respect director Tobe Hooper for trying something different.When you get down to it, this here is basically just a remake of the first film but done in a tongue-in-cheek way. The film's incredibly troubled production has been discussed to death but the budget was cut and apparently Hooper's vision was for something much bigger but we can only judge what's here. I think the biggest problem with the movie is the fact that it runs way too long with the climax of the picture clocking in at over a hour. I'm going to guess that there was a lot more character build up planned for the Hopper character. Speaking of Hopper, the film does benefit from a colorful cast and some interesting characters. Hopper manages to turn in a good performance, although he doesn't seem too thrilled to be appearing in a movie like this. Williams is certainly delightful as the radio host and there's no question that her personality is one of a kind. Lou Perry is exceptionally funny and memorable in his role. Jim Siedow is fun in his return and Bill Moseley is memorable as well. Bill Johnson can't match the original Leatherface but then again he really wasn't asked to. He's good in the part when you consider what Hooper was going for.The film also benefits from some great special effects from Tom Savini and there's no question that Hooper builds up a rather interesting atmosphere. Again, this film tried for something big and original and while, in the end, it failed, there's still no question that you've got to respect Hooper for trying something different instead of just delivering the same type of film as the first.

But I'll stick to this one here, while I might add some to my review of 'Psycho II'.First off, this isn't a slasher, just a straight forward splatter movie - Tom Savini's work is thoroughly enjoyable once again. It's sort of a do-over of the original, with an added love interest for Leatherface and a somewhat religious Rambo cowboy seeking revenge for Franklin (remember?). The new 'farm' is a dilapidated amusement park, partly subterranean. And, yes, grandpa shows up, too, alive and 'well' and even big grandma is there. Hooper went all out to make it work, and it almost did... except for that 'damned' original - it's sacrilege, I tells ya! Still, there's fun to be had with the family's struggles and 'Stretch' stretching and screaming beyond limits (her final shot is a clever combination of Leatherhead's and Sally's finale in the original).

This was actually first Chainsaw Massacre movie i saw. It was rented from videostore from other town. I still remember old VHS box with pic of Letherface on front sawing through some doors, and pic of Grandma in Chainsaw Heaven on the back. Once i first started to watch it, that opening narration and red letters from credits already freaked me out. Then, real terror started. For the next hour and a half i had great time watching this movie without pause and by the end of it i thought that it was best horror movie i saw at that time. One thing that i didn't know is that i watched cut version. One scene that i remember was heavily cut was opening murder of two yuppies. After Rick the Prick says Missed us... and looks at his buddy and screams, scene was cut and i didn't saw that great top-of-the-head-falling-off effect by Tom Savini. Still i absolutely loved the movie and that was years and YEARS ago. Although i discovered many other horror movies over the years, Chainsaw 2 was one of those that i always remembered. It has great characters, funny dialogue, AWESOME gore, scary moments that work, effective score combined with good soundtrack,and one thing that i specially like is the sets where most of the action is going on, plus if you just look at design of radio station and underground hideout, they are really good sets for low budget horror movie. Soundtrack - Since i have original soundtrack, might as well list songs that i like the most; White Night from Torch Song,Mind Warp from Lords Of The New Church and No One Lives Forever from Oingo Boingo. Another two songs that i want to mention are Over Your Shoulder and Haunted Head from Concrete Blonde. These two songs are also in another movie that i like, The Hidden from 1987. Another fun but unfortunately very underrated sci-fi action movie which also has cool soundtrack. One thing that i liked about this movie, other then its crazy plot, is Chop Top. I love that guy. He is horror movie legend and one of my fave horror movie characters whose one liners i kept repeating in normal life. Specially lines like LICK MY PLATE YOU DOG DK!, or DOG WILL HUNT! Even my younger cousins and friends loved that character. Other characters are, like i said, real fun and really add to the movie. Stretch is kind of heroine that i think is perfect example about how horror actress in similar roles should be like in movies. Lefty Enright is something of a hard-to-understand character that Dennis Hoper (RI.P,we miss you Dennis) plays in his usual great way, plus there isn't any other character in these movies that had chainsaw fight with Letherface and won. L.G is real sweetheart of a character and one thing that i thought was too much in the movie is the way that he dies, it's kinda too graphic death scene for such likable guy. It's really sad that actor that plays him, Lou Perryman,was killed in real life. Chainsaw family is once again played well by actors. I already mentioned my favorite member Chop Top, but Letherface is just as good and this time has more character development that's actually interesting when you think about it. If we put aside his sexual habits, of course. Cook with his ranting and constantly changing behavior is still present, Grandpa has small screen time but also has probably the best special effect makeup in the movie, Hitchhiker and Grandma characters are somewhat underdeveloped and silent throughout the movie, but their presence is still nice to have ;) This movie really deserved the kind of special edition that it get. I really enjoyed all the interviews, deleted scenes and specially funny commentary from cast that sometimes i like to turn on and listen while watching the movie. Well, on the other hand, that's kinda the purpose of commentary tracks, isn't it? I don't have any problem with this movie, cause it's great movie that is in my opinion, just as good and just as great cult classic as first movie.

Perhaps it was the thrill of simply viewing this film on nth generation video (it was banned in the UK back then) or the combination of comedic thrills and gory horror, not forgetting the inclusion of the excellent Dennis Hopper in the cast. I watched the movie again in the early '90s on the big screen (it was showing at one of the UK's Black Sunday festivals) and still felt it was an impressive production from Tobe Hooper.However, the passing of time has not been kind to this film. Comparing it with the original, TCM 2 is a poor imitation. I'm now thinking that my perception of the sequel was blurred by the sight of the delectable Caroline Williams running about in her Daisy Duke shorts. There's no doubt that Williams has legs-to-die-for and Hooper makes use of her impressive pins in most scenes.The film is quite bizarre - elements of comedy are shoe-horned into the proceedings at every opportunity, spoiling any potential of a return to the tension of its predecessor. Bill Johnson's Leatherface is soon reduced to the role of comedic stooge, all rolling eyes and sticking-out tongue. How the mighty have fallen! The film does have some strengths. It looks impressive, with moody lighting and some truly incredible sets. The makeup effects are well handled by Tom Savini and there are some impressive scenes. The entrance of Leatherface is unexpected and caused me to leap from my seat, nearly burrowing my head into the ceiling above.Not a disaster, Texas Chainsaw 2 just pales into comparison with the original. To his credit, Hooper didn't try to re-make the first film, he decided to take his creations in a new direction.7 out of 10. This movie remains a guilty pleasure and one I will return to.

This film's budget was apparently spent on the gory special effects and a few decent actors because those are the two best things about this movie, although the film does have a grotesque sense of humor and some appropriately weird characters. I admit that I did laugh at a few parts, such as the scene where Leatherface puts human skin on a woman and dances with her. And the new character of Chop Top(played by Bill Moseley in a very campy role) adds a strange sense of intensity to the film, but otherwise the film is overdone in the maniacal sense. However, the film definitely has great cult potential, and if you view it as a film that tries to be trashy and stupid, its not half bad. Above i said that the gory special effects are one of the two best things about this film, but thats because the murder scenes in this film are so poorly done that you can't help but laugh. This is a film that feels like it was made by an alien, because everything about this film is so otherworldly and inhuman. If you view it as a comedy, then prepare yourself for a very funny film.not rated. contains strong, gory violence and images, and language.

First of all, the plot is pathetic and ridiculous. Hero Lefty asks for the help of a radio DJ Stretch (what's that about?) to help him put an end to the murderous family's rampage. Dennis Hopper is just embarrassing as Lefty and is completely miscast in the role, he is just not believable for one second, and the feeling that he doesn't really care is very clear. My main problem is with Leatherface, he is a completely different character and seems wimpy and pathetic. He is not scary in the slightest and spends too much of his time whimpering. The scene where he is getting aroused by Stretch and puts the chainsaw between her legs is one of the most cringe-worthy scenes I've ever seen. Everything that made the original TCM terrifying and disturbing is gone in this shabby sequel and the acting is awful. It's gory yes, very very gory, but that doesn't make it good. The only decent thing about this film is the opening scenes with the two guys in the car, which made me think it might actually be half good, but sadly I was very wrong indeed.

Godfather 2 and T2 are examples of movies arguably superior to their older brothers (In the case of Godfather 2 I dispute this, but will play devil's advocate in the name of argument) and cases in point that sequels can build on the first movies in positive ways. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is not an example of this in action. Everything about this movie is significantly inferior to TCM which truly makes you ponder why a genuinely huge star like Dennis Hopper would have got caught up in such vacuous trash.TCM2 is set 14 years after the events of the previous massacre, with the brother of one of the victims now posted as a small-time cop who gets involved with a new case which seems to be a re-emergence of the old killings.He enlists the help of a radio DJ (Yes, really) to take on the family of cannibals, and in going to their lair acquires 3 chainsaws of his own (I'm not making this up) to fight them and gain revenge.Put plainly, the movie is pretty ridiculous.It tries everything and ends up succeeding at very little. The first sign of just how bad it is going to be is actually during the opening credits - the 'horror' music which accompanies the titles is unintentionally amusing. You can almost picture the musician's exaggerated gesturing as they emphasise key notes...Once into the movie it's an episode right out of The Munsters (Gory Edition). Stupidly OTT characters hammily forced by b-movie acting which is quite insufferable for the duration. Comedy is tried here and it's quite embarrassing to witness. Seeing LeatherFace's bizarre 'mating dance'-esque routine is laughable. Is that supposed to add anything to this story?Then add a general lack of gore and you have a pseudo-lighthearted failure at a splatter flick. There's no real suspense here, there's no twisted disturbing content, there's no real sense of foreboding. It's like this movie is a parody of TCM1 and not a funny or good one.It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but any picture which makes Dennis Hopper look both ridiculous and a bad actor is clearly not going to contend for Oscars.

After an opening murder scene involving two college yuppies, Lefty has his chainsaw-hunting tale published in the local newspaper. In comes Stretch, played by Caroline Williams, a local disc-jockey who just happened to record the whole murder during her request skit. Lefty convinces Stretch to play the tape again, on live radio, in hopes of drawing out the psychos that are responsible. Of course, Leatherface shows up late in the night, and Lefty doesn't. The usual madness ensues, including a pretty rough scene in which a man gets hammered to death. Not much else worth mentioning. Well, actually, the scene where Leatherface puts L.G.'s severed face onto Stretch's face was really funny, for some odd reason. Maybe it was because Stretch looked so hilarious, and that she said, No, it's wet! But, come on!! Tobe obviously tried to make this movie soooo different from the first film, and that's more than okay, usually, but it just didn't work for me, and everyone else that I know finds this title to be one of the worst movies...ever. And it is, in my opinion, one of the worst. The set was nice, though. Lots of caves, tunnels, and Christmas lights, and Caroline Williams definitely turned in a good performance. But it's ultimately not worth your time. I'm sorry. I guarantee that the majority of general viewers will not be able to finish it. It's not that I don't support originality, I just think that this one tried to be so different, and it ultimately ended up just making fun of itself.

Let me set the record straight TCM2 is a BAD movie, period. But Why? Why is it such a bad movie if its original creator, Tobe Hooper, was behind the cameras again??? It's hard for me to say how bad this movie is, since I like Tobe Hooper, LOVE the original TCM and am a gore hound, fangoria-reading freak myself. But the facts are there and they can't be denied. It's tough to beat the visceral aggression of the original; when I was young and saw TCM, I almost thought that it was really a picture based on a true account (now I know it was loosely based on the Ed Gein case). There is very little actual gore per sé on the original, but the visuals, sounds and convincing acting made it the classic it is...in other words, I actually believed what was going on. In TCM2, Mr.Hooper tried to make a horror comedy, but failed miserably. The dark and deviant humor of the original is NOWHERE to be found this time around. Now it's just dumb humor. Not even make up guru Tom Savini, with his extreme make up fx tricks could save this turkey. The acting is beyond redemption. Even Dennis Hopper looks silly as the hero, looking to avenge some of the first TCM characters. And the stretch character (this sequel's equivalent of Marylin Burns) is just plain unbelievable (it's NOT a compliment). Her acting is not that bad when she is not being chased by leather face, but once she is on the run, her screams and her gestures look totally fake, as if she were in some SCARY MOVIE episode. What's more sad is that, TCM2 actually starts out good; the outlook of the movie was interesting for the 1st 40 minutes. Unfortunately, after those 40 minutes, it all goes downhill with stupid situations and not believable acting. Granted, there's more gore on this one than on the 1st one; Leatherface's first victim gets his head sawed off in half in a very gruesome Savini effect. But even with this, the movie doesn't work. What worked on the 1st one is that you BELIEVED tha characters and the situations were, in some way, believable. Remember the psycho guy in the first one? The one that gets run over by a truck at the end? Well, the guy's ALIVE in TCM2!!!Albeit, with a metal plate as part of his skull. How come he SURVIVED getting run over by a Mack Truck?!?!? The Grandpa guy looks better 13 years later! He must've taken some sort of rejuvenating potion or something! And the ending is just plain atrocious. Get this down TCM2 does not scare, does not make you sick and does not make you laugh. It's a movie that could have been developed into something really sick and frightening, but it didn't. It seems the big budget of this sequel was completely worthless. It seems Tobe Hooper tried to make a black Horror Comedy, in the vein of EVIL DEAD or even RE-ANIMATOR, but failed miserably. Watch this turkey ONLY if you're a Tom Savini fan or want to know how bad a sequel can be. 3* out of 10*.

You really feel for her in this film as she is taken hostage by that demented family.Jim Siedow is back as the cook and in my opinion he is the scariest character because one minute he seems relatively sane and the next minute he's demented.Grandpa is also back looking older than ever (if that's possible). Bill Johnson plays Leatherface. He doesn't do too badly but he makes Leatherface a little bit too human.We're introduced to Bill Moseley who plays the demented Chop Top.

But jokes that need to be explained are not particularly funny jokes, and while yes, this movie is bizarre and contains some flashes of the first film's genius, it's an overall tedious and poorly conceived project. Even a bad movie taken as satire should be entertaining, and TCM2 is only marginally enjoyable.The first big problem is a nonsense opening sequence where a pair of moronic kids are sawed up by Leatherface in one of the most improbable death scenes in movie history. Due to the fact that the kids were on their car phone at the time with a local radio DJ, the DJ records the murder, which is really nothing more than some chainsaw sound effects and screaming followed by a car crash. Dennis Hopper arrives with a personal vendetta against the chainsaw family, and he lures the pretty female DJ, nicknamed Stretch, into playing the audio over the air constantly until the chainsaw family hears it. Leatherface and his other brother, a freak known as Chop Top, arrive at the station to terrorize the DJ. Leatherface takes a liking to her, though, perhaps due to her short-shorts, and he lets her live. She can't leave well enough alone, and she follows them home to their secret hideout an abandoned amusement park. Seriously! They live in a series of underground tunnels below the park, which is absolutely littered with skeletons and rotting corpses. Surely the family's cannibalistic shenanigans would demand a less conspicuous home base? Another memorable aspect of this movie is Dennis Hopper's kooky performance as a revenge-obsessed nutso who decides to fight fire with fire and brings along a chainsaw of his own while chasing after the clan. The film goes horribly wrong, though, by being utterly contrived and silly. Even if it was supposed to be a satire, it could have at least been funny. It's more shrill than anything else, with meandering dialogue and scenes that go nowhere. The old man character especially gets stuck with a lot of drivel that just goes on and on, whereas in the first film he was used sparingly.

Nonetheless, it delivers genuine creepiness, delightful gore, and many other great qualities. Number one Dennis Hopper. Who else could fit in the role of a hard-boiled cynical Texas Ranger as Hopper does. One must give it to this sequel that some scenes are really as morbid as one should hope, and some sequences really are hilarious.WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!Vantia 'Stretch' Block (Caroline Williams), who hosts a Rock'n'Roll program on a Texas radio station, is annoyed when two drunk idiots call her show and refuse to hang up the phone. Things quickly get interesting, when the two callers are sawed apart by our friend Leatherface and his freak brother on a freeway while live on air. Hoping for a jump in her career, Stetch decides to show the macabre tape to Lieutennant 'Lefty' Enright (Dennis Hopper), A Texas Marshall and uncle of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, who had been victimized by Leatherface and his demented cannibal family in the 1974 film. Lefty has been hunting the cannibal maniacs ever since, desperately following any clue...As mentioned above, the casting of Dennis Hopper is one of this movie's best qualities and his character Lefty is responsible for most of the film's strongest and most hilarious scenes. I also liked Caroline Williams as southern beauty Stretch, she may not be the best actress ever, but she was the perfect scream-queen for this movie, as far as I am considered. Lou Perryman plays the redneck radio station assistant LG way over the top, but this is exactly what fits in here.Both Leatherface and his equally crazy brother are played by different actors than in the first movie, the only cannibal family member played by the actor from the original, is the family's sleazy and disgusting father who has in the meanwhile become an award-winning cook (due to 'quality meat'), played by Jim Siedow again. The fact that Leatherface is played by Bill Johnson instead of Gunnar Hanson doesn't make much of a difference, since he's wearing his lovely face mask all the time anyway. Ken Everett, who plays Leatherface's brother Chop Top does quite a good job being an extremely creepy and disgusting freak. Chop Top, who is obviously what the equally disgusting hitchhiker from part one (then played by Edwin Neal) has become, is great fun to watch, especially for his morbid and disgusting habits. Many things have changed since 1974, the cannibal family's morbid little house has somehow turned into a huge cave palace of necrophilia, for example.The great gore effects are another quality, which doesn't surprise since Gore-icon Tom Savini was responsible for make up and effects.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 doesn't equal the innovative brilliance of the 1974 Classic, which was, without doubt, a milestone in Horror movie history, but it is a highly entertaining mix of nasty Horror and black comedy. People should definitely see the original before seeing Part 2. As far as I am concerned, the sequel is a must-see for Horror fans.

His vengeance attitude is the laughing stock of this film. I can hardly believe or be pushed to accept that he is a man of revenge. To me he is nothing more than some jackass running around with a chainsaw. Nothing he does compels you to believe or feel pity for his character. The rest of the cast performance is on the level of cheese or way below it. Leather face, while being an eerie force in the first film with no remorse has been turned into a weak sissy. On top of that he makes absurd gestures with his chainsaw that will make you laugh and leave nothing to the imagination. The father character has gone from a controlling figure in the first film to downright foul mouthed. The corny acting tarnishes this movie so much, that you can barely hold yourself from laughing. The plot is none existence, the buildup is long and tedious, and the movie goes on such weird directions its hard to believe that this movie is a sequel to the first. Gone is the mystery and suspense, and raw tone. Instead we get nothing but almost two hours of why and how come.What a shame, I really thought that this movie was going to be good. I had such high hopes. The colorful and cheesy direction, bad characters, and a bastardization of a franchise to the a level unlike any truly make The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 one of the worst films ever. This movie is nothing like the first, and I warn you, buy it at your own risk.

When if was first released it wasn't very well received for being released over a decade after the original not many people cared about seeing a sequel to it anymore and for those die hard fans who did felt put off because of how it took a very different approach then that the original did. The first was handled in a realistic and gritty manor, where as TCM 2 went for a very bizarre and surreal setting with a strong theme of dark comedy behind it like many other horror films of the mid 80's. However some regarded this as what killed the movies where as others feel it what made it great.I personally the that as one of the films strongest attributes. Despite having some similar scenes to the original the film had a completely different feel to it. This was good because it didn't feel like it was made just to live of the original like the Friday the 13th sequels, it was good entirely on it's own merits.While much of this film was based around dark humor it still managed to have moments that was actually scary. In this film they go into more depth into Leatherface's personality. It showed that he was capable of sympathy and other emotions and showed him as more human then what we got to see in the original and frankly made him a scarier character then what he was in the first and the film in general (particularly in the second half) had a very eerie atmoshere which even managed to last through the humorous scenes which make this the only film that managed to be scary and funny at the same time. However it was not as scary as the first.The other strenghts were that it was very quickly paced.....in the original the lead up scenes were boring...there is on question about that but even the lead up scenes often have some entertainment value and the second half of the film was literally non-stop. The other thing is that for an 80's horror sequel the acting was good and to top it off the special effects where done by king of splatter 'Tom Savini'. So there is a lot to like.If I liked this film more then the original is hard to say but he two films both the strengths in different ways and were both classics in my eyes. The first for being raw and powerful and this one for having a stronger story and faster pace. This is why Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a misunderstood horror classic that deserved better treatment then it received.

This films my not have quite have the intense atmosphere of the original but it as so many better qualities.1. The characters stood out from one another, unlike in the first where you only found out that Sally was the main character because she was the one who didn't die.2. The special effects in this film was amazing.....well it previous didn't really have many.3. The story comes together very neatly and one thing leads to another, in the first they only start getting kill because the stupidly walk into Leatherface's house.4. There actually is a plot this time.5. Leatherface was a better character in this one because it expresses how he is messed up, not in words but in Leatherface's actions, However in the first he is just a guy who wares the skinned fleah of others as a mask and chases people with a chainsaw.In many ways the 2 films shouldn't be to the first compared because the first is based on gritty realism when the second is a surreal tale that far stretches the realm of possibility and I find very bordering on being a fantasy tale rather then a slasher film. Due to that fact this film will make people either love it or hate it....I personally love it as you may have guessed and this happens to be my all time second favourite film (after Braindead aka Dead Alive). I recommend this filmhighly but take into account when you see it that there is a good chance it may not work for you.If you like this film I also recommend nothing but Trouble or House of 1000 Corpses however neither are as good.All in all I give this film 10/10!

Here, Leatherface wields his chainsaw at a 'pretty' (?) girl, falls in love with her, and becomes a BIG OLD SOFTY. He turns into Ludo the Lovable Oaf from Labyrinth (or, for Harry Potter fans, Grawp). I'm sorry but WHAT THE ****? Is this a horror movie or a children's film??? THE HEROINE Stretch is a radio DJ who wears little denim shorts but as the face of a goat. She is also the stupidest heroine I've ever met in a horror film. She actively pursues the villains to their base, with no plan and without contacting the police, and falls right into their hands. It's hard to care about her suffering when she so clearly deserves it for being such a fool.THE HERO Dennis Hopper, like his female counterpart, also decides to take on the villains single-handedly. He buys a bunch of chainsaws and goes after them on his own.

Boy was I wrong. This movie didn't seem like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film at all, it was just some plain, corny, gory flick. One reason is because a lot of it was taken place in a radio station, so the isolation and helplessness that all the other films contain is gone. It seemed like half the movie is Leatherface and ChopTop chasing this radio host around the radio station, which got old really quick. Then it turns out the family's home is a maze of caverns that was formerly a Texas state national park, each tunnel being decorated with lights, furniture, and corpses. The biggest problem that I have with the film though, is that it lost all similarities with the original film, which I consider to be the best horror film of all time. It's much more comical, and much less serious. The powerful, grainy, realistic aura of the original film is completely lost, this film is more of a quirky freak show of the Sawyer family. It doesn't match up with the terrifying original.Bottom line is, Mr. Hooper lost what the rest of these films had - the sense of isolation in the Texas country, and the serious, realistic attitude that made the original movie so scary. This film is in my opinion the worst sequel of the series. If you're going to see this, just don't expect anything close to the original.

It's badly written, with dumb, annoying, one-dimensional characters and the movie itself doesn't try to scare us, but rather to make us all go nuts from the sheer annoyance. And the thing that it hurts the most is the fact that it was directed by Tobe Hopper, the director of the original. Really? What happened? Tobe, alongside the writer L.M. Kit Carson ruined the original&#x85; just like that.Take a lot at the plot, a radio DJ Vanita aka 'Stretch' (played by Caroline Williams. Caroline was pretty good at her screamy, scared girl element, though I think she was also pretty hot there), accidentally record the murder of two hoodlums, by Leatherface. And then, there's a former sheriff played by Denis Hopper (OK, Hopper is a great actor, but I don't understand how the hell he ended up here. He was good, no argue there, but I think that this film was a waste of his talents), who is interested for Vanita's audio murder tape. Also, he is uncle of Sally Hardesty and Franklin Hardesty (the original film characters) and he demands a revenge. And from the moment when the murderous family finds Vanita, therefore begins a dumb, annoying madness, that simply makes you wanna tear your TV apart, asking yourself what a hell is going on with this film? It's loud, it's over the top, while in the original, we have the same thing happening, but the amount and style of madness in the original was good, it was scary and insane, makes you want to be scare some more&#x85; but here&#x85; it just repels you.

Other actors as Jim Siedow (another actor from the original film, the older brother of the family, who now runs a successful business with the hamburgers, made from human flesh&#x85; bad idea, if you ask me). Siedow's performance was annoying and cartoonish here. I expected, when I first saw him, to be more darker, more developed. But no, this guy was straight from the cartoon. And as I recall, he was far more convincing in the first film, here he decided not to give a damn, although he gave us an solid amount of insanity performance. Bill Moseley plays Chop-Top Sawyer, an extremely insane and annoying character. No development, nothing scary about him, he is Joker wanna-be. Bill is a good actor, but damn&#x85; here he was just badly written. I have this little theory. I think that the character of Chop-Top is actually the hitchhiker from the original film, because there was no mention of him before. Or, he just jumped as the new Sawyer family character out of nowhere&#x85; This is what I don't understand, who the hell is he? Where did he come from? Nothing is explained. And we have Leatherface (played by Bill Johnson). The only developed character in the film. The actor Bill Johnson fitted pretty well in the costume and in the trademark mask, giving his imposing height and mass, although constant mumbled yelling irritated me pretty much. Here we see Leatherface has developed an emotional love response to our leading lady. Well, that is interesting difference.HERE COMES SPOILERS I think that there are some dumb stuff that I just can't&#x85; I just can't resist not to tell you about it.

I love the character Leatherface but in this version he was very badly portrayed, would say the acting and directing are responsible. He just seemed like a caricature, almost like they was trying to hard to show you his slow mentality, too much lip licking and that stupid little chainsaw dance he done every time he was chasing someone. They should have tried a more subtle approach, rather than he keep doing the same thing throughout the film, yes we get the point he's retarded, we are not. Choptop was a horrible addition as well, he was annoying always repeating himself, chanting and again he seemed like a caricature, this time a badly done clone of the Hitchhiker from the original, I think they are suppose to be brothers but still does not make it acceptable to have a badly done version of the Hitch hiker repeating things that neither were funny or creepy, he was bugging the hell out of me. Even Drayton and Grandpa did not come off as creepy and well.Dennis Hopper was believable and not bad and so was the leading female. For a 80s slasher it's not bad, some good gore scenes, acting overall not too bad, except I was really disappointed by the villains portrayal in this movie, really spoilt it for me.The ending was pretty abrupt and seemed a bit unfinished.Not the worst but not the best either. If you are looking for a simple 80s slasher to give a watch this will do the job but if you are looking for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre experience you will more than likely be disappointed. Watching this film felt like Tobe Hooper put some poo in a brown paper bag, set it on fire and ran off and left me to clean it off my shoes.

Probably thought it was better at that time because it was exciting to revisit the great TCM story with the original director. But recently saw the laserdisc transfer (a great transfer I may add) and, 20 years later, see all the flaws. That bridge scene is still very good, but the one where Hopper comes across the remains of his poor nephew Franklin is exceptional. It puts his whole character into perspective and tells us why this miserable family of creeps must be destroyed. If not for that scene, I'd be hard pressed to even give this a two. It is obvious that Tobe Hooper didn't want to direct this himself, he's even said that many times. So it got a half-hearted and half-baked attempt, vascillating between horror and lame humor. The pluses are a good job by Dennis Hopper overall, Jim Seidow as the older brother is still in top crazy form, and two genuinely great scares (can you guess them?) The bad It's a Golan-Globus production, Leatherface has only one lousy unique overused move (because the idiots didn't want to pay Gunnar Hansen what he was worth), a really rotten 1980s organ music score - they should have just re-used the original, Mosely is a big ham here - he's better in the Rob Zombie films, much of the comedy is just dumb and out-of-kilter, the killing of the radio engineer drags on way too long and is not funny, just sick, Caroline Williams is mediocre, Savini's effects are mediocre, he has done better before this, Tobe Hooper's cameo is really ludicrous but in a way foretells what's to come. Well, he made the smart move on the TCM remake and let somebody else direct it, all while doing the outstanding Toolbox Murders remake himself.

There was humour in the original, but it was way subtler compared to the sequel. Dennis Hopper just looked pretty bemused in his role (probably wondering oh WHY?), taking it way too seriously and because of that I found him incredibly comical. Caroline Williams wasn't too bad as DJ Stretch, Jim Siedow returns from the original to play Drayton Sawyer the cook and Grandpa is back and much more livelier in this film, which kinda baffled me.

CHAINSAW 2 is a perfect example of this, a sequel which fans of the series has been split on over the years.CHAINSAW 2 takes a much different far more radical approach from the original & is very over the top in it's plot & character execution & loaded to the eyeballs with some pretty wacky & sick off the wall, pitch black humour. It's also got studio backing & a name actor. Unlike the original film, CHAINSAW 2 is packed with blood & guts.The script by L.M. KIT Carson (who also serves as an associate producer) is completely tongue in cheek, poking it's salty finger into the eye of the Regan era. With the family now being displayed as having fallen on hard times. This time the family is in the chili making business & the secret ingredient to it's success, should surprise no one who seen the first. Dreighton (called Oldman in the first film) at one point even rants on how difficult it is to make a buck with taxes getting out of control.The acting works, BILL JOHNSON stars as the hideous Leatherface & does a fairly good job, but its no secret that this Leatherface is radically different than what we seen in the first, he tends to be stupid, goofy. BILL MOSELEY is devilish perfection as CHOP-TOP, with a metal plate cover lodged in his head, a crazed whacked out former Vietnam vet & twin brother to Nubbins (The Hitchhiker in the original). He even eats himself! all the while trying to pursue Dreighton to invest in a Vietnam themed theme park called Nam Land he also has a large stain on the left side of his face (The Hitcher in the original had his on the right side) & was in Vietnam during the first Chainsaw film (which explains away his absence in the first). Speaking of The Hitcher, the family still carries his rotting corpse around! With Chop-Top milling about holding it & talking for it, heck even the rotting remains of the grandmother is still around! JIM SIEDOW reprises his role as Dreighton Sawyer from the original, while DENNIS HOPPER gives one of the most over the top crazed (& my personal favourite) performances of his career, as Lt. Lefty Enright, a crazed Texas ranger out to seek revenge on the cannibals. CAROLINE WILLIAMS is awesome as Stretch. The make-up effects are top notch & the set design is really good here, especially the underground Labyrinth Stretch is chased through, which is adorned with skeletal corpses. The score is really good here by JERRY LAMBERT (With the collaboration of Hooper) is scary. The direction by TOBE HOOPER (who also serves as Co-producer here) is well done.On the other hand CHAINSAW 2 does suffer from problems, for me the main one & the part that kills the entire film for me, was when Leatherface falls in love with Stretch, this provides a really awkward moment about midway when he takes his chainsaw & runs it up her legs & places it between her legs. It's here that the film falters. The problem I had with this plot device is simply the fact that it kills off any kind of suspense or tension to be had later on in the film. More particularly when Leatherface is chasing Stretch through the labyrinthine tunnels, you knows he's not going to kill her, because he likes her, robbing the film of any kind of impact, suspense or tension, certain scenes might have & many of CHAINSAW 2's best sequences wound up on the cutting room floor due to pacing (the film clocks in at 101 minutes). The trio of killers are also presented here as being nothing more than a horror movie variant of THE THREE STOOGES, with Dreighton as Moe, Chop-Top as Larry & Leatherface as Curly. In fact I think it's pretty fair to say that had the Stooges lived well into the eighties & were told to make a horror film, along with EVIL DEAD 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 would defiantly be it! I also had trouble with the explanation that the house Sally escaped from couldn't be found, nor any victims, facts or killers (which contradicts the opening narration of the original) since both a transport driver & a pick up truck driver, saw Leatherface & were near the infamous house of horrors at the climax of the original. Even more so, how unearth would the family back up everything, belongings, corpses & other material & clear out in a matter of a few short hours? All in all, Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 is a wildly entertaining sequel. In fact there are some fans out there who even prefer it over the original, I myself don't know if I would go so far as to say that, since I much prefer the far superior original. But regardless of that Chainsaw 2 is a heck of a lot of fun, despite the fact it is followed by a sequel, Part III is a direct sequel to the first film only & ignores this one altogether. TOBE HOOPER has a cameo at a party. The original box art also spoofs the BREAKFAST CLUB box art. Look for the DR. STRANGELOVE reference with a skeleton riding a torpedo.

After some thought, I figured I might as well give the movies a chance since I could not possibly see how they could get any worse.Besides, I think it'd be funny if I liked the sequels/remake more when most horror buffs worship the first film. With that said, I really wanted to like this film. I figured with as much as I hated the first film, it wouldn't take much to get a better reaction out of me. Well, the sequel did get a better reaction out of me, but I wouldn't call it a better film.The opening scene of obnoxious soon-to-be roadkill clearly shows that the film is going to take a more comedic route. An Oingo-Boingo song over the first murder pretty much sets the tone for the whole film. Ordinarily, I'd be appalled by the sudden genre jump; however, not caring at all for the original it didn't affect me at all. Couldn't be worse, right? This film is a sitcom with the Leatherface family . . . except it's not funny. It's relentless in mocking Texans stereotypes, but all the jokes have been written down in the large book of cliché rejects and it's not funny. I don't have a problem mocking people, but do it in a way that's witty and clever for God's sake. I saw half the jokes coming just by knowing the title of the movie, and the other half by looking at the cover of the film. I'd compare it to reading a lame net critic who think exaggerated badly-formulated jokes at the expense of a film makes him a legit critic. On that note, ahem, to say TCM2's material is stale and insultingly unintelligent would be a compliment. - and the crowd groans. Why do characters have to be complete morons to be funny? Why is every actor in this film hamming their performances to the extreme? Why is there no grounded characters in this film? Can I get a scene of someone killing Tobe Hooper for putting this many annoying characters on the screen in the same film? Please?To Hooper's credit, he did manage to make me jump; however, I still can't forgive him for the seemingly never ending simpleton dialogue between annoying (ungodly annoying) characters that set the whole thing up. Congrats Tobe. Can you get me to jump without irritating me now? And lastly, the film's main killer has evolved from an unintimidating freak in an apron (with makeup) to an even more pathetic little pansy with the mindset of a 12 year old who can wave the saw over his head (whee) and that is funny in a very sad sad sort of way. Why would Scary Movie 3 want to parody this? This film is a (bad) parody of its predecessor. But STILL, it can't be worse the original . . . right? Right? Aw, damn it is!Film contains a few chuckles, a fair amount of blood, one scare, at least half a dozen over-the-top annoying characters, and a set of chainsaws whose chains amazingly never break.

They both shocked the film world with one of their dark, and eerie takes on monsters and death and they have since struggled to live up to that sententious billing bequeathed upon them after their early success.  Carpenter has never quite managed to duplicate his stylized efforts of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, nor has Hopper managed to emulate anything near the panic and paranoia he introduced us to with Leatherface and his notorious saw in 1974.  Hooper's had valiant yet failed efforts with flicks like Poltergeist, Funhouse and Lifeforce, but his attempt to re-capture the fans predilection of the first Chainsaw Massacre with this vapid attempt is nothing short of a pure disappointment.Texas Chainsaw Massacre did something that very few films have been able to do.  It took you inside a killer's mind and a killer's dwelling and showed you the sheer audacity of their life and style.  No other villain, including Jason, Michael and Freddy can lay claim to this.  What Hooper has tried to do is further the story by taking you deeper into the family of these crazed people.  I think that on paper this must have looked like a good idea but when executed it comes off as insipid and dull.  We have probably all seen the first one, I can't imagine anyone seeing this film without having experienced the first, so what we see here is Hooper trying to give the audience some feel of the first.  There were many disturbing scenes in the first film and in this second one we revisit some of those scenes and in some cases those scenes are basically reinacted but with a different actress.  I can only assume Hooper was trying to propitiate his loyal fans but in the process he may just have alienated us.  Let's face it, Marilyn Burns will never be forgotten as Sally and long before Jamie Lee Curtis came around, Marilyn may have been considered the scream queen.  Here, Caroline Williams does her best Marilyn Burns impression and Hooper tries to recapture the horror of the dinner table scene but it just doesn't work. Many of the elements of the film don't work this time around and I think that is because for some reason you just know that there is help on the way. Somewhere, Dennis Hopper is lurking with his chainsaw and he is going to come to the rescue.  You know that grandpa is 137 years old and he is not going to have enough strength to whack the heroine over the head with the hammer.  Somehow you just know.  In the original, you didn't know.In the original, Sally was all alone.  She was her only salvation.  If she wasn't going to come to her own rescue then no one was.  You were scared f or her, you were terrified for her and you felt sympathy for her.  I really didn't feel anything for Stretch in this film.  I somehow just knew that she was going to get away.Comedy also makes this film a downer.  There are too many one liners in here and it looks as though Fred Krueger and The Sawyer family may have traded scripts after a while because what was nothing but frightening shots of sadistic people doing sadistic things is now more like a stand-up comedy than it is a horror film.Another problem is that Bill Johnson plays Leatherface and he is not nearly as intimidating nor is he as physical a presence as Gunnar was in the original.  Gunnar Hansen was a massive, mean looking guy and he frigthened me.  But here, he is more like a pussycat.  Not good for a film that was lionized in people's minds and opinion, due largely to Gunnar's portrayal of Leatherface.TCM2 is not all bad, there are some twisted scenes involving Caroline Williams and Bill Mosely, who plays Chop Top.  They share a chase scene that was trying to emulate the chase scene with Marilyn Burns and Edwin Neal from the original.  And while it was decent, again, it just falls short of it's target because we have seen it all before.All in all, this is a failing effort but it is worth seeing if you are a fan of the series.  The original is head and shoulders above this one and the third is quite a nice improvement, but just try to sit through this one and see what you think.  There are some nice homages to the first and you have to give Hooper credit for that....just not too much credit.5 out of 10 "},{"Title":"I'm bringing it down!","Date":"16 December 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":"  WARNING REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSEighteen months ago I posted a review on the IMDb raving about how great the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (8) was. Since then I've seen it again and realised my initial opinion was wrong - it's even better. Most genre sequels are trash, but, with Part 2, it's rare to find one helmed by the same guy. Director Tobe Hooper was behind a classic in 1974, he's behind garbage here.The original had artistic subtlety - this has a man driving a car at 90mph with a semi-severed head squirting blood in the air. 1974's underlying sense of devilish black humour is here promoted into incongruous, dumb-ass comic relief. The cannibals' home this time around is a vast underground cavern, adding a sense of the operatic grotesque. This sounds far better than it actually is, however, and it's quite rubbish on screen.What's someone of Dennis Hopper's calibre doing in bilge like this, uttering lines like Hell. Hell's exactly what they raised? When a film's classiest dialogue is lick my plate, you dog dick you know this isn't exactly a Shakespearean tragedy. Into this Hopper's character is projected as a detective figure, thrust into a world of hillbilly radio stations and 80s pop music. (The credits list a ten-song soundtrack). Helping Hopper is Caroline Williams as stretch, who escapes harm time and again to be the heroine. As it's obvious from the start that neither she or Hopper will come to harm; every peripheral character merely potential victim, then there's no tension whatsoever. Sole interesting bit is when Williams falls down a hole, which reminded me of Alice, but was doubtlessly unintentional. Williams does do better than most in a film where all are encouraged to overplay, and not in a good way. Nice legs, too. It's still a pretty thankless role, though, and she never gets the chance to really lose herself in it like Marilyn Burns did.It's not scary; it doesn't even try to be. There's no atmosphere, no attempt at coherent storytelling. There's no isolation this time either, the cannibal family have taken to travelling to the bright, heavily populated city for their victims, which is nowhere near as dramatically compelling. And as the heroes don't function as victims, then the cannibals have no narrative function as villains. This time they're cast as loveable anti-heroes, with Leatherface given a minor part given that he doesn't speak. He's now played by Bill Johnson, who looks stupid in the role, and uses his titular saw as sexual suggestion. Freud need not be troubled.Production values are actually fairly decent, which is, oddly, a negative point. The low-key griminess of the first is what really made the movie. This is just a (relatively) glossy piece of insignificant tat. Tom Savini's make-up is too comic book like for this kind of material, and the excessive gore is completely inappropriate. Fortunately, Chainsaw isn't a film that's known for its sequels, making this virtually forgotten. When the story was taken up four years later for Leatherface (6) it notably ignored the events of this one altogether and acted as a direct sequel to the first. Texas Chainsaw Massacre III was an okay if not great movie, and it's always nice to see Ken Foree. Following suit in 1994 was Return (3, repackaged under the classy title Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation) which is arguably the worst of the entire series. A moronic, twenty-song youthfest, it too ignored all prior sequels and had Leatherface recast as a crossdresser. As the family were no longer cannibals and were the most conventionally normal interpretation, then it also allowed for quite sadistic violence against women. Far from pleasant.However, Part 2 still remains fundamentally, if not artistically, the worst of the sequels. It's difficult to describe just how bad the experience of this film is unless you see it for yourself. It ultimately serves no purpose whatsoever - it's not interesting, it's not funny, It's certainly not scary and it has nothing to say. Being the sequel to a horror classic only makes it worse - absolute, interminable tripe and a complete waste of celluloid. 3/10.

He has personal stakes in the investigation because his relatives were killed in the first part by the cannibals. The killers attack the RJ at her radio station and then all hell breaks loose. I had high respect for Tobe Hooper. The first part of TCM is for me an iconic movie. It was ages ahead of its time and totally blew me away. He also directed the very disturbing Poltergeist. However, after 1981, his career was in decline and this must be the very nadir. The expectations from a movie which is sequel to such a landmark are bound to be high. However, this is not a victim of high expectations. The production values are nearly zero. The acting is laughable. The script can be written on the back of your pinky finger. The thrills are absent. Leatherface, the terrifying chainsaw carrying assassin has been reduced to a sappy lover over here which is frankly unbelievable. Dennis Hopper, as the sheriff, is in the worst role of his life. The cannibal family is more irritating than terrifying. When the franchise was rebooted in 2003, it was great that this catastrophe was not referred to. I cannot give negative marks on IMDb. Hence I go with ½ out of 5 for this. Second sequel I saw in a day(the other being Ong Bak 2) which really f*cked me up.

This is what the back cover wants you to think this movie is about, and though it's technically true, it's stretching also stretching the truth a bit. Dennis Hopper is first credited, and is in the movie, though his screen time probably amounts to 15 minutes or less in total, with a character introduced to be the protagonist, but ending up just being a supporting actor. This has no affect on the quality of the movie, but a little more Dennis Hopper would have been appreciated.It's been 14 years since the first murderous mayhem of the first film, and now after an unexplained decade plus of no killings, Leatherface and his wacky family are back. Two kids are killed while calling in to a radio show, and the host, Stretch (Caroline Williams), has it on tape. She wants the police Lieutenant Lefty (Dennis Hopper) to listen to the tape, so he suggests she plays it. This attracts Bubba Leatherface Sawyer (Bill Johnson) and his crazy brother Bo Chop Top Sawyer (Bill Moseley) and they come to the radio station to pay Stretch a visit. Chaos ensues and it's up to Stretch and Lefty to save the day, and themselves.The acting is pretty good for what it is. Caroline Williams is fine at acting scared and Dennis Hopper is good at acting like he knows what he's doing. Everyone else is over the top crazy, which is stupid, but produces many laughs. The direction is quite good and clear, with well done action scenes. It's the writing that fails. The script gets stupider and stupider as it goes along and by the end the intelligence of this already mentally deficient is completely gone.This was very unique for a slasher film, in that it wasn't even a slasher. There was some violence, but there are really only two characters, so thank goodness it wasn't a slasher, because it would have been the shortest one of all time.Why does everyone have a nickname? Lefty, Stretch, Chop Top, Leatherface, Grandpa...why must every character be called by a nickname? Talk about repetitive writing.Overall, this isn't very good, but it's also not too bad. It's your average horror film, and a worthy follow up to the first film.My rating ** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. R for violence and language.

This was the first of the series of Chainsaw films that would follow with part 3 (Leatherface), and the first quasi-remake years later. And, perhaps my default, I found this to be the best out of all of them. Maybe that isn't saying much though- this is a trashy, wretched, violent mash of a horror film that injects in dark comedy that borders on being too-much of a crazy thing, while still keeping true to the delirious, paranoid nature of the first film. This time, as well, in one of Dennis Hopper's three films of 1986, there's a star anchor that is almost not even really there to give the film any more prestige than it could have. The film's real stars are the guys who have come back to play the family again- the father, the brother, and ol' Leatherface himself (this time Bill Johnson not Gunnar Hanson). And, of course, Grandpa is there too.Now, to be sure, the film's real enjoyments are those of it being so over-the-top and outrageous horror- one gets the sense already of what the tone will be from the opening when Leatherface uses his skills on a freaked out car driving alongside. The music in this scene is harsh and strange, and sometimes even the funniest moments there on in have a dangerous quality to them. The performance of the brother, too, with his wire-hanger obsession, adds some weird interest. Invariably, to say that the story itself is as good and tense as the first one is probably not true at all. This time it's got to do with Hopper's character, out for revenge for the deaths in the first film, and a female disc-jockey caught up in the delirium of cannibals and the insane production design. So, as a film really as 'guilty pleasure', I'd say it was good enough for what it was meant for- lots of still crude (even with a bigger budget) scenes of action and attack, and an un-hinged quality that makes most of the performances work well enough. But it's also lacking that gritty, immediate post-Vietnam war feeling of ultimate dread that made the original a classic of its kind.

Was it a new film? A tribute perhaps? Could it ever live up the cult following the original had garnered? Well, it not only lives up to it but also etched its own special place in horror history. With Tom Savini's incredible effects and Hoopers masterful and creepy scene progression this film showed why the 80's were such a fun time to be a horror fan. Let me be straight about this It IS NOT PART 1! It could never be that film, and quite frankly why would they revisit it? You can never re-capture that kind of raw ferocity unless you totally re-made the film, and what fun would that be? Instead Hooper took a low monotone and brooding soundtrack, coupled with a heaping helping of psycho sexual tension, some very dark comic moments and made one hell of a sequel. Dennis Hopper is good here, but Jim Siedow and Bill Moseley really steal the show giving a Psychotic and hilarious tone to several crazy scenes. Not to be outdone, Caroline Williams shows why today's horror films are so lame... they don't have a real scream queen! She really puts in a great performance. Bill Johnson is great as Leatherface too, he may not be Gunnar Hansen but at the same time he's his own Leatherface, and a damn good one at that. Lastly Savini's FX is top Notch, and really sets the tone with its quality workmanship. All in all its not for everyone, but for those horror fans who do get it its a special treat not to be missed.

I'm by no means a prude when it comes to cinema, I have see countless B-movies and schlock films but this, well, I just couldn't enjoy it at all. What is it that is so bad about it? Well, to put it quite simply, this is actually in the horror/comedy genre and not in the 'its so bad its good' way. Why on earth they would possibly want to make the sequel to what was such a gory, dark and disturbing film a comedy is beyond me. All I know is that it doesn't work at all.Basically two drunken losers, who are driving to a party, call into a radio show and won't get off the line. The presenter ends up hearing them die at the hands of the Texas Chainsaw family and for some reason she thinks this tape of random sound effects will help the police. She meets Hopper's character - a Texas Ranger who is hot on the trail of the family due to some family member's murder. The two have very little screen time together but still try and work together to sort things out.Having said that there are two scenes that are actually disturbing - one of them is when Grandpa is trying to hit the Radio Presenter with a hammer and the other is when she finds her friend LG towards the end. But you'll see what I mean if you are unfortunate enough to watch this.So yeah, there we go a horror comedy that isn't funny and might have worked with a better script and the realisation that it would be better suited as a straight out horror piece.

He's out for revenge against the cannibal clan for what they did to his family, while radio DJ Stretch (Caroline Williams, who is a lot of fun) simply tries to survive after she airs a radio broadcast that p1sses them off. The psychotic father (who makes award winning chili out of human flesh), Leatherface and the 100-and-something-year-old grandpa are still around, plus new member Chop Top (Bill Moseley), who has a metal plate in his head, suffers from 'Nam flashbacks and does some disgusting things with a clothes hanger and a lighter. The cannibal clan hideout, which is hidden underground beneath an amusement park this time, is a marvel of skeletal decor, hooks, cobwebs, tunnels and blood oozing walls. In fact, everything about this movie is taken to insanely outrageous proportions, and it drops the straight horror and sly black humor of the original for more blatant shocks and in-your-face comedy, which explains the critical hatred.

"},{"Title":"The first of many incompetent remakes...","Date":"13 April 2007","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" In 1974, Kim Henkel and Tobe Hoober scraped together a bare amount of cash in order to film what would eventually be released as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. An odd title, to be sure, since only one of its characters was killed using a chainsaw, and four victims hardly constitutes a massacre. Still, in spite of being distributed to theatres on prints that barely looked better than the home videos that would appear later in the decade, Chainsaw became an almost instant cult classic, with viewers expressing amazement at how restrained the film seemed to be. Indeed, the original Chainsaw shows that in a clash between the power of suggestion and the power of gore, the former will always create a more horrifying film. Assuming one knows how to execute it properly, that is. Unfortunately, Chainsaw 2 is little more than an attempt to recreate a past glory with little regard to the circumstances of that success, or the changing circumstances that the mid-1980s had brought. One almost pictures a writer trying to tell Hooper and Carson that the days of the drive-in are over.It would be all too easy to blame director Tobe Hooper for the non-event that follows, but that would be taking the easy way out. Hooper had previously gone to glory with such works as Salem's Lot and Poltergeist, so one must wonder if the screenwriter is not to blame. In contrast to all the sequels and remakes that would follow, Chainsaw 2 attempts to vary the flow of the film a little by introducing a few unique locations and subplots. In so doing, however, it also creates a few questions that remain difficult to answer, even when one remembers the film was set in 1986. The ability of two men to storm a radio station and attack a DJ raises the question common to many a B-grade horror film, namely where the police presence is. To its credit, Chainsaw 2 more or less fails to follow the tired old cliché of lining up a group of interchangeable teens for the villain to chop to pieces. Instead, it follows a completely unhinged Dennis Hopper on a quest for revenge, and Caroline Williams on a senseless ride around various locations.One vital component of the original that none of the sequels or remakes have ever got right is Leatherface. In 1974, Gunnar Hansen created a character with a myriad of subtle micro-movements that terrified audiences as much with his bizarreness as his chainsaw. He was frightening because one could look at him and see that there once was a human being inside. By comparison, Bill Johnson, and every Leatherface that has followed since, was a robot. The repertoire consists of Walk To Point A, Chop Victim A, Walk To Point B, repeat. Whereas Hansen quite obviously delved into the mind of his character in order to create something three-dimensional, Johnson is just there. And this only serves to highlight how ineffective Jim Siedow, Bill Moseley, and Ken Evert are without a strong Leatherface. In the original, the men playing the family were incredibly creepy, and their dinner-table scene terrifying due to the dynamic they had with Leatherface. In Chainsaw 2's copycat dinner-table sequence, they are merely annoying.In another example of how the clash of cultures results in a weaker film, the helpless damsel portrayed by Marilyn Burns in the original is replaced in this sequel by a proto-feminist everyone keeps calling Stretch, portrayed here by Caroline Williams. Much like Marilyn, Caroline looks as if she would weigh a hundred pounds with sand filling all of her pockets. This is not a problem if one knows how to structure a story around the character, but Chainsaw 2 even proves a letdown in this regard. The most ridiculous scene in horror film history comes toward the end, when it becomes clear that writer L.M. Kit Carson is still asking how he can ape the glory of the original Chainsaw. After watching Gunnar Hasen's iconic chainsaw dance in the original, Carson apparently thought this would be a good scene to recreate with the heroine. Never mind that the original dance was done by a man who stands close to two metres tall and looks like he weighed about two hundred and fifty pounds naked. The result is a ridiculous shot in which the question on everyone's mind is whether Caroline is swinging that chainsaw, or whether the chainsaw is swinging her.And that is pretty much the problem that every sequel and remake to Chainsaw has suffered from. It does not help matters that in the same year, a sequel to a much higher-budget horror film took the story not only in a whole new direction, but into a whole different genre. Throughout the running time of Chainsaw 2, an amazing temptation to ask where we have seen all of this before keeps mounting. This must have proved incredibly frustrating to Tobe Hooper, who at this point was starting to fill his resume with a long list of trash. Nobody else here even proves remotely worth remembering, with even Dennis Hopper's performance coming off as recycled from somewhere else. When I read about the original idea Hooper and Henkel had for a sequel to Chainsaw, I honestly wish that I could have seen that particular project realised. Unfortunately, the 1980s soon gave way to a culture in which everything had to be played safe, and this meant the demise of innovation in all horror franchises. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is just an early example.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a one out of ten film. It gets four bonus points for the ridiculous attempt at a chainsaw dance, but loses three for all of the annoying or phoned-in performances that precede it. Definitely not a keeper.

So far though, horror film franchises are the most prone to failing at being better than their initial entry in cinema. For one reason, it's understandable if the founder left the project entirely because then the sequel may not be in the best hands to carry the story. That's not the case here. Director Tobe Hooper, the man behind the first movie comes back to direct his long awaited sequel that almost seems like he forgot what made his original so horrifyingly stimulating. But he didn't forget, Hooper admitted that he wanted this entry to be less serious. And for what it shows, in some ways it is goofy but its dark humor doesn't always save it.Taking place 14 years later, audiences are introduced to Lefty Enright (Dennis Hopper), a man looking to find the cannibalistic Sawyer family who killed his brother's kids and friends from the first movie. To Lefty's dismay, trying to convince the police that the killers exist hasn't been going well. Fortunately for him, he meets a radio host named Stretch (Caroline Williams) who happened to record one of their killings over a live broadcast. With that, Lefty asks Stretch to help him make the public aware of the current threat. As an entry continuing the story, it does have some key moments that show thought did go into it, but overall there's less plot than before. Of what seems to be a subplot to expose the Sawyer family is then abruptly dropped for Dennis Hopper going on the hunt himself. What was even the point of making him apart of the police department if he decided he was going take matters into his own hands?There are some intriguing moments that screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson does include in this entry but not much of it feels completed. For continuity sake, Carson accomplished that. He not only makes reference to the original verbally but physically as well so that shows he had the right idea. As an interesting token, Carson also sheds some light on the Sawyer family. Specifically, that Drayton Sawyer (Jim Siedow, the 'ol pop) is a renowned chili cook. This is some of the dark humor because the audience realizes what Drayton belongs to but the characters don't. Another weird side note is that audiences get to see Leatherface actually display what almost seems like a little more humanity than before (almost). This key moment occurs whenever Leatherface is around Stretch. It's these elements that show Carson had some appealing ideas but only some of these character threads are fully realized. There are still some things that don't make sense though. An example of this is Bill Moseley, who successfully replaces Edwin Neal's role as the hitchhiker. How'd he get so horrid looking? No explanation for that. Dennis Hopper as Lefty isn't all the most believable because of his straight face performance. However, there are times where he blows a gasket and it's entertaining to see. Caroline Williams as Stretch doesn't play much of a memorable character. She does show some courage at times, but mostly she's screaming widely to the point of ridiculousness. Although Jim Siedow was the only original actor to return for the Sawyer family, the entire group still acts as if they were apart of the first movie. Bill Moseley copies Edwin Neal's performance nicely, Siedow had no trouble reconnecting with his original character and Bill Johnson who replaces Gunnar Hansen as Leatherface still looks terrifying. The camera-work was largely forgettable throughout. With an extended running time by 17 minutes from the original, there were only a couple shots that look good with the lighting. Everything else was a rather mishmash of ideas. It's as if Tobe Hooper didn't have much of a direction on how he wanted anything to look this time.The only other good aspect to this horror film is the violence. With practical effects master Tom Savini helping, the kills are bloodier and the props are much grosser. Gorehounds should enjoy the grossness. As for scariness, it's not much of scarefest because audiences have a clear idea of what the Sawyer family is all about. The music provided again by Tobe Hooper and additional composer Jerry Lambert doesn't waste time in ditching the atmosphere so cleverly crafted from the original. Instead of incorporating bonesaw noises, chicken squawks and what sounds like clanging kitchen tools, has been replaced with the all around generic synth piano. The notes are frantic to induce panic and scares but because there's no atmosphere to the tune, it sounds largely uninspired and bland. Even for its conclusion, which felt rushed to begin with, feels almost nonexistent or effective in its delivery. Like other average horror sequels, it has a number of scenes that proved its writer had the ideas but could not completely stitch them together properly. The lead actors are middling in their performances, the music has no atmosphere and the story has a thinner plot than the last. The only things worth mentioning are its ability to still be gross in its visuals and the minor unfinished character threads.

I'm just gonna say this right from the outset. I detest this sequel. I wouldn't call the original a favorite of mine, but it definitely deserves it's reputation as a bona-fide horror classic. I'm really beginning to believe Tobe Hooper was a fluke (No. Poltergeist doesn't count) He hasn't made a decent movie since that one. This one is a cannon production, dooming it before it even began. Cannon has made some entertainingly cheesy pictures (Including one of my favorite movies Bloodsport) but to try to replicate the success of the original was a ludicrous idea. This is full off loud black comedy that gave me a headache. Too many things are for comedic effect in lieu of the terror we received in the original. A lot of people seem to like the opening to this movie, but I found it to be stupid. The first time I watched this movie, I knew I was in for a long 100 minutes or so after that opening. One thing I don't get, is why they didn't do a followup from Marilyn Burns character from the original. I would have love to see if she was over the ordeal or if she had become as nutty as a fruitcake from the incident. Instead of that, we get a half-cooked sequel that feels all jumbled. There is some gore. We get a head sawed in half, somebody is beaten viciously with a hammer, nasty human faces, self-inflicted lacerations and more. Dennis Hopper is by far the best thing about this movie. Purportedly, he hated this movie. This is probably why he hammed it up like no tomorrow and decided to have some fun with it. As a result, I had fun watching him as a chainsaw welding maniac. Wait until you see the scene where he buys a few chain saws. Caroline Williams has great lungs and can scream with the best of them.

It must be. As a horror film, it's totally inept. The characters are either annoying, stupid or ridiculous. The opening scene shows two total geeks in a car as they cruise along the highway drinking and shooting road signs. One of them laughs constantly like some stoned idiot from the movie Reefer Madness. They make the mistake of playing chicken with a pickup which turns out to have Leatherface, the chain saw crazy villain, as the driver. They meet the pickup on a bridge and somehow it manages to drive itself, apparently, as Leatherface with his chainsaw stands on the roof and chops up their car. The trouble is, the gore makeup effects in the scene looks so fake it's downright inept.Dennis Hopper looks totally out of place in this film and the female lead played by Caroline Williams is a rip-off of the Adrienne Barbeau late night disc jockey in John Carpenter's vastly superior 1980 The Fog.

TCM2 does exactly that.I'm quite amazed at the poor rating of this highly entertaining dark comedy here on the IMDb. I can only imagine that TCM purists are offended by Tobe Hooper's refusal to duplicate the grimness of his original classic, thus the inordinately high percentage of 1 votes, but who can say? I note with interest the small cohort of females 45+yo who must all be friends of Scream Queen Caroline Williams, as well as the relative dearth of votes for this second entry in one of the most enduring franchises in the horror genre. Perhaps last year's DVD release will eventually help this title gain a few points as more people are exposed to this currently maligned piece of Grand Guignol.No matter. TCM2 stands up quite nicely as a representative of the 80s zeitgeist, particularly in the form of Bill The Devil's Rejects Moseley's Chop Top, the whacked-out vet of the Sawyer family. Reams could be written regarding how his character reflects on the situation of Vietnam veterans a decade after the end of that benighted war, but this isn't the place. Suffice to say, Moseley blesses us with a memorable performance that outdoes Ed Neil's Hitchhiker in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. TCM2 is loaded with some classic imagery and setpieces that stick in the brain long after the film is over Leatherface's probing of Stretch's superb legs and cutoffs-clad pudendum with his overtly phallic chainsaw; Chop Top's incessant and disgusting self-grooming; the patchwork skinning of L.G. McPeters (played by TCM assistant cameraman Lou Perryman with great likability) in all its gory glory; the subsequent mise-en-scéne with Stretch wearing L.G.'s face like a Halloween mask; Leatherface with a chainsaw through his gut, still mobile and dangerous; a maddened, triumphant Stretch doing the chainsaw boogie; and, just to top things off, one of the weirdest sets ever seen in a slasher film, comedy or no. Production values are remarkably high, centering on the awesome makeup fx work of splatterking Tom Savini, who was fresh off some amazing work on George A. Romero's Day of the Dead. In addition to the above-mentioned actors, TCM2 sports a somewhat restrained but still scene-chewing Dennis I am ubiquitous! Hopper as the vengeance-seeking, twin chainsaw-wielding Lefty Enright (get it?), who would soon be reveling in the notoriety of a trifecta of memorable performances (Blue Velvet, River's Edge, and Hoosiers) that would forever cement his reputation as one of the edgiest (and best) character actors in the business. Also of note is the return of Jim Siedow, the only carryover actor from the original TCM. His portrayal of Drayton Cook Sawyer is a twitchy, cantankerous, picaresque marvel, and it's a shame he was never able to parlay it into a decent film career, although I'm sure the Houston theater scene is glad he didn't.Bottom line if you're looking for a repeat of the original classic's nerve-wracking tension and horror, you'll be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you're willing to let auteur Tobe Hooper and his screenwriter, L. M. Kit Breathless Carson, have their way with taking Hooper's creation in a totally different but still demented direction, you will be amply rewarded. TCM2, unlike last year's dreadful prequel, should be a part of every gorehound's DVD collection.

A really nice looking DJ with great legs happens to record a couple of dummies being killed by the chainsaw clan and tries to help Hopper find them, he ends up using her to find them. I found this movie okay, but to many underground scenes and another dinner scene kind of drag the movie down a bit. I would have liked to see them out and about more like in the first gruesome kill. There is a cool chainsaw fight at the end in which I have read where people have complained it was to short, but I thought it lived up to expectations.

There's never really a moment where you experience true horror. This film, thanks to a much larger budget, is too polished to get under the skin(..unless you are easily offended by cannibal jokes). I don't recall one genuine moment that haunts you or even scare you. Despite what happens to heroine Williams, you never feel like she'll not survive. Several of those key ingredients this film lacks is what gave the original it's punch and long-lasting status as a film that must be experienced by every horror fan. The film really boasts having Hopper in it..though, to be honest, he's coasting here. It's Williams who gets the camera time..well, her and Leatherface(..which can be a good and bad thing). Leatherface has all the aura of terror stripped from him here and he's more of a laughing-stock. His brothers torment him and we get an understanding of why he's so strange. The film has a tour-de-nuts performance from Moseley as the brother with a silver plate on his skull(..to add dimension, he often takes a hanger and peels off dead skin from his head, around the silver dome, to munch on)and tendency to use a dead corpse as a puppet to speak through. Poor Williams just gets a raw deal as she tries being heroic, going to ex-Texas ranger Hopper with a recorded taping of a murder by Leatherface and Moseley of two college partiers. Hopper seeks vengeance for the murder of a relative at the hands of the Sawyer family. Using poor Williams, he finds their creepy lair..an abandoned amusement park. Williams goes through pretty much the same as the original version's heroine. Her head is stuck over a bucket for great grandpa to beat over with a hammer. She gets her own friend's skinned face placed on there by Leatherface..and is made to dance with him! She has to fight through all kinds of hell to escape their lair after falling through a hole in the ground. This film is loaded with gore, lots of chainsaw stabbings(..we see Leatherface's guts hanging out as Hopper hacks away with his own chainsaw), and demented humor. It's overkill, but the blasted movie is so enthusiastic and over-the-top, the sequel becomes entertaining within all the madness.

This sequel shares the most important situations with the original, like the torture dinner scene, and Leatherface's attacks.This time our favorite cannibal family escaped from their secret location to hide once again but this time in an abandoned Texas amusement park in order to continue their murder spree. But this time someone is hunting them down for various reasons. Lt. Lefty Enright, uncle of Sally and Franklin from part 1 wants to take revenge against the murderers of his relatives (techically Sally didn't die but it's never explained what happened to her until part 3). Lt. Enright is not alone because he has the Lord by his side, situation that offers many hilarious non-sense Christian/Catholic references when he's about to face evil. Lefty tracks down the Sawyers (yes, that's their last name, pretty clever! Sawyers = Saw) after Leatherface and Chop-Top provoked the accident and death of two drunken snobs. Unfortunately for the Sawyers, the murder they committed was broadcasted live on local radio. Thanks to the hot DJ Stretch and her ambition to get on prime time radio, Lefty manages to find the hidden location of our beloved cannibal family. After a series of unfortunate events for Stretch and L.G., Lefty faces the clan and takes his revenge in the name of God.As you can notice, if you haven't seen the movie, the plot surrounds Lefty's revenge and the new torture mechanics of the Saywers. But TCM 2 is more than that. This movie is filled with unique black humor and great gore. The scene where Chop Top smashes L.G.'s head with a hammer is a classical moment in 80's splatter manners. First, Chop Top hits him repeatedly with the hammer and yells Nam flashback!, or incoming mail!, then he takes the -presumably- dead body and escapes with Leatherface who minutes before sexually attacked (in a bizarre way) Stretch. The second scene of L.G.'s death is better. It's a confusing black humor moment with many blood! We see Leatherface ripping L.G.'s face with a knife and then puts in over Stretch's face, while they dance around. After that, L.G. still alive tries to help her to escape, and in a very weird scene it's implied that he wants to stab her with a knife.. it doesn't happens. That scene explains the whole TCM 2 concept  a bizarre Horror movie that mixes black humor.The whole Lefty dialogs are hilarious and cool at the same time. Lines like Lord, you show me the way, help me beat this stranger that was beside me , as he watches a creepy sculpture, is a weird moment in the series. Lefty displays these kind of lines through all the movie. The Christian-Catholic lunatic who takes revenge in the name of the Lord is truly a bad-ass. He manages to take down the whole Sawyer family except for Chop Top, who later finds his demise after a struggle with Stretch.Tobe Hooper apparently lost his mind or smoked something while making this movie but I really thank him for coming up with a version of TCM that has NOTHING to do with the original TCM that we love. Hooper mixed gore with humor and excellent performances. Bill Moseley delivers a memorable performance that has paved the road for actors who mix Horror with black humor. The man steals the show. He's violent, hilarious, aggressive, lunatic.. the man is a true talent. Dennis Hopper delivers also a weird but brilliant performance as the bad ass Texas ranger who keeps singing born in the noontime growing seeds of kindness , brining in the sheaves... He's the best character to face the Sawyers in the whole series. Jim Siedow also delivers a fine, hysterical performance. Die hard fans love the man. He's excellent in both TCM movies. Bill Johnson delivers a new performance for Leatherface with goes with the tone of the movie. An okay performance. Caroline Williams also gives a perfect performance and the fact that she's hot doesn't hurt! Watch TCM 2 to witness one of the best Horror comedies of the past 20 years. This movie won't let you down in the gore or entertaining factor. Some fans of the original seem to have this sequel but I think that it deserves a chance as a stand alone version of the 1974. I'm a huge fan of both and I watch them as two different movies even that they share the same characters and almost same situations.TCM 2 is a clear example of the greatness of 80's Horror.

Dennis Hopper is great as usual as Lefty Enright, uncle of Sally and Franklin from the first film. He's completely obsessed with finding the killers responsible for their deaths. He gives a great performance, going from 100% badass near to first of the film to certified lunatic as it near the end. The Sawyer family is even more over-the-top. Leatherface and Drayton (AKA The Cook) return from the first film, crazier than ever, and are joined by brother Choptop, who puts the rest of them to shame in terms of craziness. Bill Moseley plays him superbly, in what is easily one of best and most over-the-top roles. I didn't particularly care for Strech, the heroic late-night radio DJ, but she was well acted and served her purpose.The plot was much better than the majority of slasher movies, but I think it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible. I didn't even read the back of the DVD before I watched it, and I really think that helped my experience.Last but not least, the gore! The first film had almost no on screen gore; it left it up to the viewer's imaginations. This is the polar opposite, throwing buckets of blood and body parts at the audience as often as possible. One of the greatest horror effects gurus, Tom Savini, was behind them, so you know they had to look awesome.All in all, I really enjoyed this film.

It is really impossible to top such a significant thing, and director Tobe Hooper knew that when he decided to go back to Texas for another adventure of the cannibal family.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 follows Stretch (Caroline Williams), a radio host in the limits between Texas and Oklahoma who one night tapes a phone call that is the first proof of the existence of the legendary maniacs of the infamous Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Without knowing what to do, she goes with Lieutenant Lefty Enright (Dennis Hopper), a retired cop who is on a personal hunt for the psychos as his nephews were killed by the cannibal clan 14 years ago. Lefty is decided to finish the Texas Chainsaw Massacre once and for all.Instead of attempting to repeat the magnitude of his masterpiece, Hooper decided to use a different approach to the movie turning it into a violent and unmerciful parody of the horror films of the 80s, complete with powerful gory violence and over-the-top set-pieces. Sadly, apparently nobody understood the joke and the film was bashed and unfairly ripped apart as many were expecting a movie on the vein of its predecessor. Still, the sequel works very well on its own terms and it is as entertaining as the first one is scary.With a superior budget and the aid of visual effects genius Tom Savini, Tobe Hooper is able to create powerful scenes of violence that pushes the boundaries of what was allowed on a mainstream feature of its time. Adding more black humor to the movie this Chainsaw is definitely a product of its time and while nowhere near to the scares of the haunting first movie, it makes up for that with pure sheer entertainment courtesy of Jim Siedow (returning as the Cook) and Bill Moseley as Chop Top. Leatherface (Bill Johnson) is back too and his role is extended showing Hooper's true intentions of having him as a somewhat innocent, but still dangerous and violent killer.It's obvious why the film may feel as a disappointment, as it relies more in comedy than in horror, but the story is cleverly devised and just as the first did, it makes an exaggerated and harsh critic to the dark aspects of American society. The over-the-top gratuitous violence contrasts with the subtler approach of the first one, but in the film's context is very appropriate. Savini makes a very good work and it is definitely one of his works of the 80s.Dennis Hopper and Caroline Williams are a bit average on the lead roles. Hopper makes a good interpretation but sometimes feels uninterested. Williams gets carried by the character and makes an exaggerated portrait of her role as scream queen in the movie. On the other hand, the cannibal family is at its best with Siedow completely owning the screen and Moseley in a very funny role that looks like the Hitchhiker of the first one completely on acid. Johnson as Leatherface is less menacing than Gunner Hansen, but actually that's what Hooper intended in this story, so it is safe to say that he did a good job for the most part.This sequel to the 70s masterpiece certainly will disappoint fans expecting a movie like the original, but those just waiting for a hour and a half of fun that doesn't take itself too seriously will find a terrific experience. Tobe Hooper may not be a great horror director, and he definitely won't be able to create another movie of the magnitude of his praised debut; but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a fun quality flick that horror fans should not miss. 7/10 "},{"Title":"This is one of the good ones","Date":"8 April 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" Of all the hundreds of horror films I've seen this is one that has always been among what I consider the best.Now it doesn't have the sheer impact of terror of Tobe Hooper's first one because we sort of know about the chainsaw ,of course,but Hooper still manages to freak you out, nonetheless.Part 2 isn't a rewarmed version of the first one.In this film the crazy killer cannibal family is running a catering business,and winning awards for it,no less.Let's just say their secret is the meat.Dennis Hopper plays a lawman on the trail of the insane family and his character is only a shade less crazy than they are.Hopper is absolutely great in this film and we are treated to some wickedly gory special effects by the great Tom Savini.The duel between Leatherface and Hopper is a legendary scene while the Old Man prattles on underneath the table on which they are dueling with chainsaws.This film is an original.No other film I know so well combines terror,horror,gore and craziness .It also has it's share of memorable lines.Tobe Hooper created a masterpiece with this film but sadly it seems to have been overlooked by many folks who may just consider it a crappy sequel without ever having watched it.Yes the horror genre does contain many crappy sequels,including parts 3 and 4 of this series, but this film isn't one of them.Tobe Hooper served up a delicious meaty meal with this film and true horror fiends lapped it up.Now it's your turn.

This was the first unrated film I ever saw in the theaters in 1986, and I have to admit seeing it because it was unrated. I was not disappointed, either, it is a very entertaining ride. Yes, the production was definitely rushed, and maybe even too-much time had elapsed since the original in 1974, but we'll call this one family--warts-and-all! First a lot of the plot is just stupid, especially the subplot with Dennis Hopper, the brother of the annoying-asshole in the wheelchair from the original. Frankly, the guy in the wheelchair was so annoying, it's hard to empathize with the Hopper character, since I'm glad his brother got-killed. 0) The chainsaw between the heroine's legs was pretty sexy, too. I did think the recording of the radio call-in was well-done, though, it was very disturbing. The film also boasts some excellent-gore by Tom Savini, including a scalping and a character losing his face to Leatherface.Again, the yuppie-prologue was great in 1986, but does look a little dated today, although there will always be assholes like that who die in the Tobe Hooper universe. That makes it OK. But like a number of good horror films, it somehow rises-above all the problems, and still works. It mixes humor and horror well, and there were a number of times it was hard to look at the screen. I also liked the chili-judging contest section, which was a real hoot, and more of Hooper's commentary on animal-cruelty (apparently, some vegetarians LOVE this aspect of both films). Like most Tobe Hooper films, it looks well-lensed and composed, especially the underground-den of the cannibal family, is damned creepy. The true standout is actor Bill Mosley's performance as plate-head, he's what makes some of the classic moments in the film. He's funny AND creepy-as-hell. If he reminds me of anyone, it would be Tex Watson of the Manson Family, and there are a few submerged-references to them in TCM2. His best-line Awwwwww, Leatherface, you done' ruined my Sonny Bono wig!! He's the best, and on-par with Jeffrey Combs as a horror character-actor, just sublime.It's good to see Tobe Hooper doing hardcore-horror again (I loved Toolbox Murders), and I hope to see his Mortuary soon, it sounds excellent and funny like this one. If there is one thing that distinguishes Tobe Hooper's films, it is his oddball sense-of-humor and physical humor in horror. It's almost like combining elements of Lon Chaney with Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. Some balk that you can watch the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a comedy, but it's true--it's pretty-funny, and relatively bloddless! This one will make you laugh, even as you cringe! Tobe Hooper makes films about what scares him, and he copes with it through humor. Besides, the audience has to have some kind of outlet for material this strong. This is where he is similar to Stuart Gordon, who also ultilizes comedy to give us all a break from the horror! I have heard rumors that the theatrical and video-cuts are incomplete, and that Hooper had a much wetter cut of the film, but that the producers and distributors balked. I'd sure like to see that! The MGM DVD is passable, and has a good transfer, but just offers the trailer, which is paltry. Still, they at least offered it widescreen, which is its best presentation.

With great over the top performances and more gore than the first film, and the only TCM movie to feature an actor from the first film, this should have been the last TCM movie made. I also thought that this film had that same feel as the original 1974 classic. I guess that a lot of people get lost in the humor of the film, but I also thought that it helped set the pace. The only thing that I find wrong with the film was the fact that one of the people had been hit with a hammer many times over, and after his face had been cut off, he still is alive.

That's the way the 74 Texas massacre's sequel should really be. it's very different from original, but Hooper did a nice job to make everything right. Dennis Hopper is playing former sheriff Lefty Einright. The maniac's killed his brother's children in 73. They were Sally and Frank Hardesty. Now he's to avenge. It'll be some special revenge. The movie begins with two criminal parodies are driving the Texas road, shooting the road signs and listening to DJ Stretch's(Caroline Williams) station. Then they give her a call and start making troubles... They even appear to be so stupid to trouble the respective Mr. Leatherface and his survived brother after falling under truck in first part. Very soon they get sewed and pretty Stretch's taping all that noise as the hoodlums don't hang the phone. The crime's investigated but Lefty wants to start his private one. He's not with cops. He wants to punish the maniac's his own way. Stretch is really eager to help. She finds Left and suggests to play the recorded tape on line. And Left hopes this will make the maniac's get out of their hiding-place. As all this is being prepared to start we get known to Drayton (Jim Siedow). He wins the cookie contest, but doesn't open the secret what meat really makes it so good. Left goes to get weapon, but not guns. He buys three chainsaws - a long one, and two compact. Stretch starts playing the tape. Soon the killers pay her a visit when she's alone in the studio. Then her life will be saved by Leatherface's suddenly occurred love to her. Later she'll appear in the underground purgatory where three sick bros and grandpa live. Lefty has already figured out the place and gets there. All you see after and saw before is really impressing... Now how all that looks. The acting is good and beautiful, nice photography, decoration and special make-up by Savinee. The score co-written by Hooper gives more good atmosphere. The script is very unordinary but shot believably to amazement if you're told the movie first and then just watch it. I loved this movie. Oh these seducing 80's! At least 12 years later maniac's live in a better house, look modern and have more to lay on table. Hard to believe this movie was considered bad in 86, and Hooper keeps amazing every time. Very interesting director! He rightly used all the sources. You'll even see him for not more than a second. Watch attentively and you want miss. Now, this part is really enjoyable, funny in some sense, colourful. All the three bad guys are good especially Chop Top and Leather face, and Drayton perhaps for his commercial success has become a really kind maniac. Bill Johnson (Bubba) really gives extra performance. In the end we won't know what really happened to the heroes for sure. Well, they could hardly survive. Wait, no. Chop Top survived in the first part and this slight falling is not much for him. He'll do good. As for me, I prefer to consider them alive but not to see in such a stupid project like LeatherfaceTexas massacre 3. The second was the last good leatherface effort. Leave the poor guy alone, he's done. 9 out of 10! Highly recommended! Impressing! Entertaining! Tobe, you're good.

There was no way in hell that this movie could compare to the original. But, Tobe Hooper did do a good job at making a sequel that was still a good horror flick. The film takes place over ten years after the original massacre. Throughout the years, people have been dying of grizzly Chainsaw deaths. We have a DJ, by the name of Stretch, who actually hears (yes, hears) one of the murders committed by the Cannibal Family. But, when Stretch tries to play detective, by playing the murder on the radio, the Cannibal Family decides that she needs to be shut up once and for all.The style of the first film, and the style of the second film, are TOTALLY different. In the first film, Hooper used psychological horror to scare us without a drop of gore. In this film, he uses extreme gore effects (Tom Savini gore f/x) to gross us out, and he added in the character ChopTop (Bill Moseley) to give us some good laughs.If you like gory, funny movies, then check out THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2.

I think it is every bit as good as the original. It is the best sequel because it was directed by the Master of Macabre and Mayhem Tobe Hooper, it also explainswhat happened to Sally Hardesty from the first after she escaped Leather-Face when that guy in the pickup truck helped her get away from Leather-Face andhis saw, she was sent to the hospital. There, she told the doctors that she broke out of a window in hell, She babbled the most bizzare story anyone has everheard A family of modern, cannibalistic hillbillies in an isolated farm house, chainsawed fingers and bones, chairs and funiture made out of humanskeletons, her brother and her friends captured and hacked for barbecue. After she told her terrifying tale, she sank into catatonia (she fainted from fear). So, the police launched a month-long man hunt. Despite a painstaking search, they could not locate the mad house. No crimes, no evidence, no bodies, no Leather- Face, no nothing.13 years later, a couple of fun-seeking teens are driving down Dallas, Texasand call a famed radio DJ so-named Stretch. They continue to harras her over the phone until they are attacked on the road by a certain masked killer with a chainsaw, Leather-Face, good to see you again! Stretch records the screaminga buzzing of the saw and takes it to Lt. Lefty Enright. Lefty is the half brother of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, and when he heard about Sally and hernightmarish story, he made it a life mission to track down Leather-Face andcompany and kill them to obtain revenge (how dramatic). So, Stretch and Lefty team up. Lefty asks Stretch to broadcast the tape with the massacre on it onpublic radio so that the public (and of course, the police, who don't believe Lefty about his sister's Chainsaw Massacre). Drayton Sawyer (the cook from theoriginal) hears this on his radio and sends his 2 cohorts, Leather-Face andChop Top (the hitchhiker's late brother) over to the radio station to kill Stretch. But when the killers get there, Leather-Face FALLS IN LOVE with Stretch anddecides NOT to slice her into pieces. I think this element is good, because it shows that Leather-Face has something that most other killers and slashers(like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers) do NOT have EMOTIONS. Leather- Face may be a murderous idiot, but at least he knows what love is. Hemolests her with his saw, try finding THAT in WEST SIDE STORY.When Leather-Face and Chop Top leave, Stretch follows them to their home.Which is an underground layer beneath an amusment park (that's why thepolice couldn't find them). She also meets Lefty there, too. When Stretch falls through a trap door into the Sawyer's layer, Lefty breakes out some chainsaws of his own, he bought two small ones and one really big one much like Leather- Face's. So, the vengeful lawman enters the Sawyer's layer to rescue Stretch and of course, punish the Sawyer family for what they did to her sister!Nice work, I love ya' Tobe Hooper!

McPeters, (Lou Perryman) come forward with evidence in the case. Trusting his instincts, he gets her to play a tape of one incident over the radio which attracts the attention of Chop-Top, (Bill Moseley) and Leatherface, (Bill Johnson) to the station. Stumbling upon their hiding place with leader Cook, (Jim Siedow) she is held captive in a massive underground lair until Lefty mounts a rescue effort to get her back. Deciding to also settle an old vengeance against the family, he fights to both set her free and settle his score.The Good News This really surprised me with how good it really was. One of the greatest things about it is that it has a fun atmosphere present. From the simple storyline to the amount of action to the sick displays around at the ending, this movie simply screams good time. Right from the opening chase scene, where the family chases and chainsaws a car and the passengers traveling along a highway bridge, it sets an incredibly ominous tone that is equally spread throughout the rest of the movie. The attack in the radio station is one of the highlights, due to the fact that practically everything happens in there that could possibly happen. There's a great chase through the library stacks, great gore with a kill involving a hammer to the head, one of the best jumps possible where Leatherface comes roaring out the darkness with chainsaw blaring and one of the greatest and most suspenseful scenes in the genre. Trapped in a room with a large ice-chest, the attacker stops when he realizes the victim is covered in ice water. What happens afterward is incredibly sexual and very tense, but the fact that a chainsaw is present there makes it all the better and all the more memorable. There is another fantastically sick scene later on, where Leatherface, using an electric knife, slices off the face of one of his victims, takes it still dripping wet with blood, and places it over a characters face and proceeds to dance with them. It's great in it's concept and comes across as really disturbing and quite memorable. The gore in here is quite over-the-top and comes from so many great deaths. There's a guy bashed repeatedly in the head with a hammer, a guy who is still able to walk even though the skin of his face and other parts of his body have been peeled off, a throat slashing with a straight razor, a head chopped in half, and a chainsaw wound through the gut and out the back. There's piles of skinned corpses and body parts laying around on the floor, and with intestines stored inside a giant barrel, there's so much additional blood and guts on display in here. There is also a really spectacular underground labyrinth, which looks like the ruins of a hotel turned into a slaughterhouse with bizarrely placed corpses sitting under sun-lamps, at dinner tables, suspended on wires, all amid a bewildering maze of chandeliers and Christmas lights. Whenever the film is set there, it's impossible not to like it, and becomes another great factor about the film. What needs to be said about the chainsaw sword-fight at the end, which is really spectacular and brings a special extra to this. All in all, there is a large amount to like about this one.The Bad News I really have a hard time finding stuff to dislike in here. This was a really enjoyable film that had tons going for it and really nothing I could find wrong. The one thing that even remotely bugged me was that the black comedy may not always be funny. It's such a change from the original that it's distracting to those expecting an all-out creep-fest. Other than this, there isn't anything in the film that's wrong.The Final Verdict It was surprising how good this one actually was, and with so little against that's also very easily overlooked, this is one of the very best entries in the series and one of the better sequels made.

Even more manic, with inclusion of occasional humour; as a result, the film appears less realistic than its predecessor, and a bit more fantasy-horror oriented. The macabre gags are tasteless and never funny - not to mention inappropriate (as they usually are in heavy-handed horror films). There is plenty of twisted and perverted stuff that goes on here, continuously. Nothing at all for the more squeamish horror fan who considers Halloween as the height of gore. Perhaps all the butchery goes too far, but TCM 2 is also a suspenseful, well-directed piece of insanity, with a realistic enough mood not to come off as laughable, ineffective crap.Certainly far better than Hooper's dull Poltergeist (which Spielberg, the producer, made sure would be more spielbergish than hooperish).I've read hundreds of absurd reviews from geeky film critic Leonard Maltin, but in his text about TCM 2 he managed to surpass all his previous nonsense by calling this movie pretentious. What drugs is this little man on? It would be like referring to Schindler's List as humorous, saying that a Bergman movie was exciting, or claiming that Disney's Bambi was obnoxious. Maybe Maltin doesn't even know what pretentious means. Or he let his 7 year-old watch the movie and review it, because Maltin was too busy having dinner with some Hollywood actor or producer who needs to kiss his behind.

Dennis Hopper knows better, and tries to track down the culprit. With the help of radio DJ Stretch (Caroline Williams) he may finally have figured out the mystery.Many fans will say they enjoyed this film more than the original. Heck, even Rue Morgue magazine (the Canadian equivalent of Fangoria) bluntly says this is the superior choice. And you know, they are probably right this film is more fun. And sometimes fun is the key to success.Tobe Hooper was originally just the producer, and only stepped up to be director after several career conscious young directors passed up on it. He worked on the script, though he says the script's humor comes from co-writer Kit Carson, who also incorporated some of the phrases like dog will hunt and music is my life. Hooper saw his input as making the film true to the Yuppie-ism of the 1980s and notes it is satirical even in its poster, which mimicked The Breakfast Club.Dennis Hopper in any movie is a good idea, but Hopper with chainsaws is really about as good as it gets. I will not lie to you the chainsaw fight in Motel Hell is better than the chainsaw fight in this movie, but either way you have dueling chainsaws and Dennis Hopper. I cannot stress enough how cool that is (and if you do not understand, you are watching the wrong genre, my friend).Leatherface was sort of goony in this movie, looking very non-frightening, and shaking his head and shoulders every time he lifted his chainsaw (for reasons I cannot even attempt to explain). But he was made up for by Bill Moseley (Chop Top) with his very odd character and immortalized line, Dog will hunt. Immortalized if you listen to the Primus song, Jerry Was a Racecar Driver, that is. Moseley is now a horror movie standard, but this is arguably his most notable appearance and what brought his specialty to the attention of horror fans.Bill Moseley got hired after sending Hooper a Betamax tape called Texas Chainsaw Manicure. Although already in his 30s, this was only his second film, previously appearing in the little-seen Endangered Species (1982). That film, incidentally, had JoBeth Williams just after she wrapped Poltergeist, which may have been what inspired Moseley to audition.The gore is surprisingly minimal. Few people die, and even though corpses get chopped up and faces removed, it is really not very creepy. Hooper says that special effects maestro Tom Savini was more than inventive in coming up with some bizarre and gory detail.While the film is more silly than scary in many ways and has a weak ending, it still has some sort of charm about it. Watch until the first death. If you like it, keep watching. If not, this film is not for you. Most likely, you will find this worth your time.The Fox-MGM Blu-ray has a handful of special features, including two commentaries. One with Tobe Hooper and another with the actors. Anything and everything you would want to know about the film is available on the disc (although Hooper is not quite as talkative as some directors).

I taped this movie a year ago, and since then, I must have seen it over 80 times! I only realised that when a year had passed, I had watched the film 9 times that day. Secondly, ALL of the actors in this movie did a BRILLIANT job. I think Dennis portraid a brilliant character, a little insane, but a great character, I won't go into too much info about how great his acting was, because he admitted he gets a bit spooked when people say he was great in his movies(also mentioning this movie). Caroline Williams; Wow! A brilliant actress that brought courage, sexiness and humour to the film, and that's just talking about the character she played! Bill Moseley; What a hoot! Great guy. I've talked to him a few times, and he is great. Great humour and...a weird prescence he delivers. Jim Siedow, I have to say I prefer him in this movie compared to the first. 1) He has more dialouge, 2) His character has a name, 3) His character has a lot more meaning. And Bill Johnson, he delivered a great threatning role as Leatherface. Great job done. When I taped this film, they cut out all of the good scenes, you could even see where there were cut scenes, it missed out when Stretch was cornered by Leatherface and he pressed his chainsaw against her thigh, it missed where ChopTop, Leatherface and Drayton slaughtered a gang of yuppies in a parking lot, and where Leatherface slaughters Joe Bob Briggs. I've bought the movie on video casette for Xmas, so hopefully those scenes will appear. Great film, and I can't wait to see the remake of the first.

Sassy Texan radio DJ, Stretch (Caroline Williams), who is talking to them on the phone when the attack occurs, records their death screams on the radio station's tapes. Extremely violent (one of the yuppies has the top of his head sliced clean off like a boiled egg!) and nightmarish in its execution, the beginning lets the audience know that they are in for an experience totally unlike the '74 classic.Stretch approaches Lieutenant 'Lefty' Enright (Dennis Hopper), a bible thumping lawman obsessed with finding the killers who slaughtered his brother's children, and offers him the tape as evidence that the chainsaw killers really exist. Lefty convinces Stretch to play the tape over the air which results in Leatherface and Vietnam-veteran Choptop (Bill Moseley) paying the DJ a visit.Stretch barely survives an attack at the radio station (by appealing to Leatherface's sexual desires) and, perhaps unwisely, she trails the maniacs back to their lair. Following close behind her is Lefty, kitted out with power tools and hell-bent on revenge and retribution...TCM2 combines the horrific premise of the original with the gaudy look of Hooper's Eaten Alive and the freakish fairground setting of his 1981 slasher The Funhouse. The result is a demented, dark, and delirious film that was totally misunderstood by critics on its 1986 release who, expecting a carbon copy of the '74 film, refused to accept Hooper's vivid OTT imagery or his twisted sense of humour.Unlike TCM, the killers (and some of the victims) in the sequel are grotesque caricatures, designed to repulse, yet also amuse Dennis Hopper's Lefty is almost as crazy as those he seeks (he thinks nothing of using Stretch as bait) and is clearly missing a few marbles; Bill Moseley is great as Choptop, a more than capable replacement for Edwin Neal's psycho hitchhiker; Jim Siedow returns as a kooky cannibal cook who keeps the clan in order; and even Grandpa makes an appearance&#151;now 137 years old and still a dab-hand with the lump hammer (not).Caroline Williams makes a great heroine looking absolutely yummy in her tiny tight shorts (what a pair of gams!), she combines sexiness with bravado, and still manages to give Marilyn Burns a run for her money in the screaming stakes.Tom Savini's gruesome make-up is as nauseatingly realistic as one might expect and certainly makes this a film for those who love the gore. The catalogue of messy effects on show include the aforementioned head-slice, a nasty hammer attack, a 'face removal', assorted severed body parts, and a whole heap of guts and internal bits 'n' bobs.The 'Gruesome Edition' DVD also includes a couple of notorious deleted scenes which will be of interest to TCM fanatics Leatherface and family attack some teenagers in an underground garage (this moment is saddled with some bloody but rather iffy effects and a dose of silly humour); and the family go to a cinema where they slice up a couple of women in front of movie critic Joe Bob Briggs (another bit of crap humour, wisely excised from the final film).If you are a fan of the original, please view this film with an open mind. Don't make the mistake of comparing it to TCM; judge it on its own merits and you will hopefully end up appreciating it for its many gory and excessive 'charms'. "},{"Title":"Easily one of the worst horror sequels ever made","Date":"17 April 2006","Score":"5 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" According to this movie the killers from the original Texas were never caught and are still roaming around. The uncle (Dennis Hopper!) of one of the victims is hunting for them. For some reason the family sets its sights on pretty DJ Stretch (Caroline Williams). Pretty soon she has Leatherface running after her with his chainsaw. She's captured and then the film REALLY gets sick.Just hopeless. What the hell was directer Tobe Hooper on when he did this? It seems like he's trying to do this as a black comedy. The problem with that is that it isn't funny--just pretty sick. The opening attack is gory, violent and lots of fun...then the film slowly falls apart. The story rambles all over the place--jumping from unfunny humor and truly sick violence never finding a consistent tone. Hopper chews the scenery every chance he gets (was he rehearsing for Blue Velvet?) . Williams is good but really...this film goes way too far in what's done to her. At one point Leatherface basically tries to use his (turned-off) chainsaw to have sex with her; at another point he takes the skin off of a victim and puts it on HER face! This isn't funny or scary--just sick. Hooper's direction is off too--no surprise there. His movies since Texas have been just horrible--Texas was a fluke. (Poltergeist doesn't count--Spielberg had that whole movie storyboarded before Hooper even got on the set!) I caught this at a theatre back in 1986. It was unrated (basically a self-imposed X) so (lucky me) I caught it in all its glory. (I heard the R rated one is edited). I was sickened, confused and (by the end) bored. The very end was just SO stupid I thought they were kidding. Just dreadful. Let me put it this way--I'm a HUGE horror movie fan but this was so terrible I refused to see the third one that came out a few years later. Skip this one.

It must be the reason why they tried something new and different for this movie but this however really didn't worked out too well.Biggest disappointment the fans of the first movie will have with this sequel is that it's totally lacking as an horror. The tension and the atmosphere of the first movie, which was its biggest strength, is pretty much gone in this one and even the Leatherface character in this movie isn't as threatening anymore. As a matter of fact, he isn't even the main villain of this movie.But there are plenty of more reasons why this movie falls flat as an horror/slasher. For one they even added lots of comedy this time, as if they really weren't taking themselves that serious, which really goes at the expense of the tension of the movie.I even think Tobe Hooper never really wanted to make this sequel but got somehow forced to after failing to get his career as an established director of big Hollywood movies off the ground. Making a sequel to his own horror classic, 12 years later, was the only way for him to keep working and keeping his name in the spotlight.What makes the movie in itself also pretty bad is the fact that it are basically two totally different movies combined into one. The first and second half of the movie are quite different in style and tone. The second half of the movie is definitely more in style with the 1974 classic but unfortunately it still isn't half as powerful or gruesome.The movie still has a couple of great gore moments in it though. Moments that are mostly made great by Tom Savini's expert make-up effects. But other than that, there really is nothing that makes this movie distinct itself from other average genre movies, except for the presence of Dennis Hopper in this perhaps.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Oh, please tell me they did not do this!","Date":"24 November 2003","Score":"3 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":"  I hated this movie!

And the original from 1974 WAS an absolute milestone in the genre. Its cruel and scary style changed the horror industry forever. So keeping that in mind, my expectations towards this sequel were very low. But I must admit there were several elements about this production that made me give it the benefit of doubt...First and foremost Tobe Hooper directed again. Most directors don't feel much for making a sequel to their own masterpieces so I thought it was rather positive that Hooper returned. After all, he has proved he's able to make a masterpiece. Then I read Tom Savini himself was responsible for the makeup in TCM 2. If you know your horror, I don't have to explain you this is a guarantee some for good old gory and bloody scenes. And, last but certainly not least, the castlist was filled up with the name of a star. Dennis Hopper would play Lefty...the uncle of some of the youngsters who got killed in the original TCM.WARNING === SPOILERS COMING UP !! Now, after viewing TCM 2 a couple of times, I still don't know whether I should like it hate it. I'm a huge fan of the original but this is something completely different. I've heard some people saying that this is how Hooper the original wanted to be ! Well, if that is true he made an unintentional masterpiece and he should be thankful for that. This sequel certainly isn't bad, but it's disappointing if you expect something similar to the first. It all starts well, with another introduction by a strong and severe voice over but pretty soon it turns into a gore comedy with loads of blood, guts and crazy one-liners. The whole tight and creey atmosphere (which made the original so great) has gone. So has the element of surprise ! There isn't much of a storyline present neither...Lefty, a former Texas Ranger hunts down the maniacs while the government tries to cover it up. The psycho Sawyer-family has gone through some changes, though. Dreyton is now a respected citizen and every year he wins a trophy for making the best chili in Texas ( the secret is in the MEAT, he says in his speech. lol ). Being helped by a radio-dj, Lefty finds their house and starts a little demolition... END SPOILERS !!!Bill Moseley as Chop Top is probably the most remarkable character in TCM 2. He's an hyperactive little maniac and some of his quotes ( Lick my plate) are very popular among horror fans. His background story interested me more and I recommend you to pay attention to that as well when watching it. I've always been a fan of Dennis Hopper, so I'm glad to see him star in a B-horror movie. The girl can't act very well, but she does leave a good scream-queen impression ! The way she yells would even make Jamie Lee Curtis jaleous... I have few complaints about the first half of TCM 2. It's creative and funny and a good change. The second half however is a failure, in my opinion. This half is boring and gore at the same time...believe me, that is not a good combination. You won't regret watching it, but if you're a fan of classic and scary horror, you should stick to the original. Everything that came after this sucks harder, though. We've got two more sequels ( among the worst movies ever made ) and right about now, we have an utterly pointless remake of the first...which I'll boycot -)Favorite rewind-moment...Dennis Hopper testing chainsaws in the story. He swings them around like they're umbrellas. The expression on the salesman's face is hilarious "},{"Title":"I actually rather liked this mixture of horror/black comedy.","Date":"24 September 2004","Score":"1 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" And for that I apologize to no one! Why do I like it, well firstly I should say a little bit about the films story. We open in Texas, with two idiotic yuppie annoying kids driving along in a flashy Mercedes named Buzz (Barry Kinyon) and Rick (Chris Douridas), they call a local radio station and wind the host Vanita Brock (Caroline Williams) up who goes by the nickname of 'Stretch', they also play chicken with a pick up truck forcing it off the road, which they find very funny. Later on that night they call Stretch again and start annoying her (and us, the viewer) again. Then they come across the pick up from earlier blocking the road, it backs up and lets them through but starts to chase them over a bridge, side by side. Leatherface (Bill Johnson) jumps up from the back of the pick up and kills them both with a chainsaw. All of this is captured on the radio and recorded. Lieutenant Enright (Dennis Hopper), know as Lefty to his friends has been trying to track the chainsaw killers down for years in revenge for his brother who was killed by them in part 1. He arranges an appeal for information in a local paper. Stretch see this and takes the tape to Lefty at his hotel, at first he seems disinterested, but manages to persuade Stretch to play the tape on air that evening so he can flush the killers out. It works and the chainsaw family of Leatherface, Chop Top (Bill Moseley) and their rambling and frankly plain annoying Father (Jim Siedow) hear the recording on the radio and go after Stretch, and in turn Lefty goes after them armed with a couple of chainsaws of his own. But will he be able to save Stretch and put an end to the chainsaw families murderous activities? You'll have to watch to find out!Directed by Tobe Hooper who directed the original, I thought Texas chainsaw 2 was a good film. Some of the black humour falls a little flat, especially Jim Siedow's head of the family character, he rabbits on about nothing in particular and is a little hard to understand, very annoying. The gore, by Tom Savini is good and there are one or two nasty sequences in there, someones head is cut in half with a chainsaw, someone is beaten to death with a hammer, there's a slit throat plus there's a pretty gross scene where Leatherface slices someones face off with an electric carving knife and you should see what he does with it afterwards. The script by L.M. Kit Carson keeps moving at a fair pace and kept me entertained, I liked it. Production values are solid enough and it has a certain Hollywood polish about it that was definitely lacking in the original, whether this is a good thing or not is up to you to decide. Apparently the film had a troubled production with infamous producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus supposedly messing around with it post production, there are some cut scenes floating around on a laser disc somewhere which I have seen and among other things include more killings and gore, would have been nice if they had left that stuff in there.
