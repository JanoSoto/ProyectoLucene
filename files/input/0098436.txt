[{"Title":"Ironically, its Rowan who plays the straight man in Richard Curtis' fictionalised version of his frustration playing straight man for Rowan.","Date":"27 June 2004","Score":"12 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Richard Curtis has written some impressive romantic comedies (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones, Love Actually) and had his hand in the writing of some of the top British TV comedy of our time (Mr Bean, Not the 9 O'Clock news, Blackadder). This was one of his first scripts to be turned into a feature film.He wrote this script about his own experience playing straight man to Rowan Atkinson on his early tours. Curtis was frustrated in real life with being under the shadow of Atkinson, but the script obviously makes a caricature out of this by turning Atkinson into a terrible, nasty villain. But, Rowan fans beware, this is not as fun as it sounds. The unkindest touch of all was added by Rowan himself. He makes himself appear completely unfunny. He plays his backstage self without a touch of humour or subversion - one would almost swear that Rowan just really was a nasty bast*rd.But anyone who's seen Rowan's stage shows, or Not the 9 O'Clock News, knows that Rowan can play a bastard with ironic humour, where we know he's only kidding - on stage, Rowan specialised in bastards like the vicars and schoolmasters he's played, and nobodies like Mr Bean. Here, Rowan knew it was important for the story for Rowan to not actually be funny, and the straight man to actually be funny. Plus, we need to root for the straight man (played by Jeff Golblum). Rowan's being a villain is the story's main source of conflict and dramatic tension. Without it, there isn't a story. So Rowan has, ironically, done a brave and humble thing by agreeing to play it completely straight, humourless and cold - and he shows himself a really good dramatic actor (though the experience may be disheartening for Rowan fans).So if you're a Rowan fan, this will not be for you. If you're a Richard Curtis fan, this is a fairly simple and conventional script, but its quite a fun romantic comedy nonetheless. Emma Thomson is suitably cold and severe, and Jeff Golblum makes a good everyman. 6/10.

Rowan Atkinson is the obnoxious, unpleasant comedian who torments Jeff. Emma Thompson is a pretty, deadpan nurse who gives Jeff's life hope and meaning when he falls in love with her and vice versa. After parting ways with Atkinson, Jeff lands the lead role in Elephant!, a musical version of The Elephant Man, in which he plays, of course, the Elephant Man. Jeff's eternal happiness is nearly thwarted by a cute co-star who threatens his romance with Emma Thompson. Will Jeff come out on top? Of course he does. This isn't The Fly after all. Too long but still very funny, with Jeff well cast as the title character. Atkinson is a great antagonist and Emma Thompson has her moments of inspired deadpan humor. And of course, the actual Elephant sequences are a riot.Vengeance shall BE MINE! Jeff as Dexter King, AKA The Tall Guy.

The result is The Tall Guy, probably the greatest comedy of 1989. I remember going to see it twice at the time and laughing all the way through it, amazed that British comedies could be this good.It has a huge amount going for it with intelligence, cracking lines and some highly stylised photography by Adrian Biddle.Curtis' semi-autobiographical script is based on his own days as a fall guy for Atkinson and the result is well worth a look.

One's taste in comedies is a highly personal thing, and not everyone will find this movie to their taste, but if you like the inimitable flavor of British humor (as I do) and enjoy Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson, you will probably find this movie to be extremely rewarding -- that is, hilarious and, perhaps, a bit touching.It's got its flaws, of course.  There are plenty of spots where nothing really happens, the music is pretty uneven, and a few gags fall flat.  There are one or two key plot points that are a little hard to follow (especially the scene with Emma Thompson on the television).  And surprisingly, the last quarter or so turns a bit grim, and comes a bit close to losing sight of the whimsicality which is so much of this movie's charm.But I'll gladly put up with all that for what this movie has to offer.  It's incredibly hard to make a good comedy, and all too many comedies nowadays are either too tame, or too scatological...too cruel, or too meek...too earnest, or too smug in their irony.  The Tall Guy proves that there is ground between these extremes, and what fertile ground it is!  I don't know if one could make this movie in America;  the entire film is permeated with a uniquely British sensibility that makes it irresistible.  And in the midst of all this, Jeff Goldblum is absolutely spot-on as the bemused American;  his facial expressions and reaction shots in this movie are priceless.  It's a pity that so many of his recent roles have been in action movies;  at his best, Goldblum is a fantastic comic actor, and this movie depends completely on his charm, wit, and expressiveness.One of the centerpieces of the movie, by the way, is a musical based on The Elephant Man.  It's a tour-de-force of parody, brilliantly satirizing the tastelessnesses and mediocrities of modern musicals;  indeed, I wish we could get to see even more of it.I recently revisited The Tall Guy for the third time, watching it side-by-side with There's Something About Mary, and I can't begin to tell you how much the latter movie suffered by comparison.  They have a few traits in common -- both movies revolve around the pursuit of a beautiful woman by a misanthropic-but-oddly-handsome male Jewish lead, both have a strong sexual element to their humor, and both feature a prominent handicapped character (a blind man in the Tall Guy, a man on crutches in Mary) whose misadventures are played for laughs.  But where There's Something About Mary is coarse, mean, and obvious, The Tall Guy is witty, absurd, and completely good-natured -- and in my opinion, far superior.I suspect there are a fair number of people who won't get The Tall Guy, and that's a shame.  But if it sounds like it's on your wavelength, rent it if you can find it.  It's an incredibly sweet and funny movie that is well worth the watching.

When Goldblum's Girlfriend and Landlady share a box to watch the first night of his starring role as the Elephant man their disparate reactions to the show echo the disparate reviews that appear here.As with most comedy, you have to be somewhat in the right frame of mind to enjoy it... and the sneering classes aren't ever going to be in the right frame of mind.British comedy has a tendency to be either gentle and thoughtful and unafraid to mix real drama and sadness in with the humour (As Time Goes By, Last of the Summer Wine, 4 Weddings and a Funeral) or traditional farce (Monty Python, keeping up Appearances, Fawlty Towers).Americans seem to get the latter more easily and this is one very much of the gentle, thoughtful ones. If your reaction to the death in 4 Weddings was why did they put that in there? It's not funny don't see this film. But if your reaction was discover that the sadness highlighted the joy of the remainder and brought it into focus then you'll get this film and enjoy it.Jeff Goldblum and Rowen Atkinson fans beware! Both are playing very much against type and in Atkinson's case that is a deliberate self parody and part of the joke. He is funny by being as unfunny as it's possible to be.So what about the film, specifically? The story is a fairly simple one except with some clever role reversals on sexual stereotypes. Shy boy, worldly wise girl, evil boss, hard times survived, good times lead to temptation and betrayal and, finally, a denouement which echoes back to the role reversed attitudes that cemented the relationship in the first place.The show is funny and well, though not perfectly, paced. The straight and personable acting enhances the comedy as do the moments of real drama. There are zingers throughout the show, not all of which are verbal.Everyone takes away a different perfect moment from the film and for me it was the exchange between Goldblum and the policewoman... I'm sorry, I know I was speeding but I have to get to the hospital right away, Oh yes, of course... You poor man.If you want to know WHY that's so funny you can probably work it out from all that's been said or you'll just have to see it to find out.

It isn't a masterpiece, but it isn't trying to be. This film revels in wackiness and silly sexuality, and never takes itself seriously. It's a humble love story that always leaves me smiling.Jeff Goldblum has just the right kind of weirdo edge for the part. I don't know many American actors who would take on a role requiring them to sneeze on a naked plumber or get shot in the arm by a barking doctor. Rowan Atkinson is deliciously acerbic as an evil version of himself.I recommend The Tall Guy if you enjoy any kind of off-the-wall British comedy, like The Young Ones (I'm sure that's where the singing Y-fronts originated!), Monty Python, or even Rowan Atkinson's own stand-up shows.See the British release if you can! The US release has been messed about by some editor who seemed to think many of the jokes would go over Americans' heads.

Though the love story seems not to be the major message, I was on the edge of the seat all the way through. There are so many clever jokes in this plot, at short intervals at that. Perhaps this makes the difference.Jeff Goldblum is doing well in this European style comedy (didn't expect him to). Emma is doing great too. The music is well chosen from the 80th Britpop charts...

I was idly flicking channels and came across a scene with Jeff Goldblum and Rowan Atkinson. Thinking to myself that this was an interesting-looking cast, I stayed with it, and was later also introduced to Emma Thompson, and much to my surprise, extremely small one-line roles for Angus Deayton, Robin Driscoll and Charles Augins.It was fun while it lasted. Rowan Atkinson has some more memorable scenes as a snide, unlikeable character, and Jeff Goldblum is actually quite fascinating in romantic, love-me mode. Considering it was very late at night, I hope I can be forgiven for not regurgitating the plot correctly here, but I seem to remember that Goldblum played a reluctant straight-man to Atkinson in his stage show and decided to step out on his own, which eventually led to him getting the lead role in a musical production of The Elephant Man. I'm not sure if it was all as corny as that sounds but it was roughly it. It was certainly enough fodder for a few laughs and a few smiles all around. I wouldn't mind viewing this film again while fully awake, but I'm sure it would be just as entertaining. I give this one three stars out of five.

Both were to move on to much better things! That said there are weak signals of Curtis's talent later to be fully realised in Four a Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually. But a few good lines does not a coherent movie make and the plot is shallow and the characterisation sketchy at best. Jeff Goldblum's Dexter seems bewildered by everything - not least his subservient position to comic superstar Ron Anderson played with believable malevolence by Rowan Atkinson. Emma Thompson, then just 30, looks lovely and shows her developing talent as a comic actress. The best thing in the film by some way.Mel Smith's direction drags a bit and it is only in the very funny mock musical Elephant - based improbably on the Elephant Man - that the film comes to life. The musical is a chance for Smith to satirise the musical genre of the time with references to Les Miserables and especially to the Lloyd-Webber songbook. A Sarah Brightman lookalike does a number straight out of Phantom and it's very funny.The film is quite daring with an explicit sex scene between Thompson and Goldblum that is so energetic that they destroy the former's bedroom, The relationship between the two is a forerunner of Curtis's boy/girl romances in later movies. Always a slip or three between cup and lip! This is not a great film nor even a very good one. It is worth study as an exercise in how Richard Curtis's talent was first applied in a movie rather than television for which he was previously known (especially for Blackadder).

There are the awkward sexual moments in the film which is outrageous and out of place at times. I enjoy Rowan Atkinson who plays a British comedian who does his show eight times a week with Goldblum as his second in command.

That may mean that it's not terribly appealing to either people who like the British form of comedic style or those that like the American type, but it works surprisingly well! It's an absurd tale of an American actor (Jeff Goldblum) relegated to perform as a second banana for a West End favorite (Rowan Atkinson) in a London theatrical production. His allergies force him to go to the infirmary, but his view of a nurse (Emma Thompson) gets him over his dislike of injections and begins getting weekly shots from her, just to spend a moment of pleasurable pain in her presence. After finally getting a date, and upstaging his fellow thespian, and after getting sacked for it, he then lands the lead role in a new musical, all about the life of John The Elephant Man Merrick! But, of course, complications arise.The plot is helped greatly by the performances of unbelievable moments from the musical, and by a very raucous love scene with Goldblum and Thompson, one of the most violently joyous ones I've ever seen in a film! The three leads are all brilliant in their performances, especially Atkinson, who is much more Blackadder here, and not at all Mr. Bean.OK. It might not become your favorite comedy ever, But it's very cute for what it is, and is definitely charming and wonderfully funny.

It also provides a backdrop for a rendition of 'It Must be Love' by Madness that you will never forget.The film revolves around hapless Dexter King (Goldblum) who is a tall, out of work American actor living in Camden. Having been sacked from Ron Anderson's one-man show (a great self-parody by Rowan Atkinson) he strikes up a romance with nurse Emma Thompson. His lucky break as the lead in a new West End musical - Elephant!

They still give me pleasure to think of even now, though it is many years since I last lay my hands on a copy of this film.The film left a big enough mark that when I married my wife she insisted on 'It Must Be Love' for the wedding!

True, the humour is not at everybody's grasp, the songs come up in the middle of nowhere and a few more flaws are patent; but at the same time the actors' performance are great (finally Emma Thompson is funny! And she's naked too! added my male friends; Wow, Rowan Atkinson can speak, as most Italians would say; and Goldblum's distinctive oddness for once doesn't look out of place). The story is a simple, funny one about love, the satire of the theatre world is brilliant and that of the Health Service is funny but could be much ruder (but that was 1989!).I know most of this movie by heart, and I can't stop watching it every single time it manages to move me!

I've always said the pie throwing scene in The Great Race was the best ever filmed. Well, the heavy breathing scene in this is the best ever filmed of that genre. It's funnnnnnneeeeee.... Hilarious. And very athletic. Jeff Goldbloom is the classic American loser set in an environment of British winners. Setting the story in London rather than the US gives it that extra little edge of wierdness.

I didn't know Jeff Goldblum was such a comedy genius! The film-makers wonderfully expressed their concepts through skillful film direction. Funny details have been put in the movie and you'll have to watch it closely a few more times to discover them, it's well worth it and you'll realize how playful, neat and smart this picture is.Goldblum played Dexter King, a tall American actor whose career is rather not successful. Dexter works for comedian Ron Anderson (Rowan Atkinson) at a theater, and is sort of being exploited by the latter. One day he goes to the hospital for his allergy he meets a nurse named Kate Lemmon (Emma Thompson) and falls in love with her at first sight. She's confident, sensible, intelligent and full of energy, just like her favorite color - orange (orange and green are her favorite colors, orange particularly). And Dexter is very, very attracted to her. Kate is like sunshine which lights up Dexter's life, they are happily in love and he later takes a part in a musical, everything is going well...There are smart satire and romantic elements and as well as surprises in this story. Brilliant direction, and the film is finely tuned in an amazing way. This movie doesn't just make me laugh out loud from the beginning to the end, it makes me feel so happy, happy, happy!!!

All are superb and have flashes of scene stealing brilliance.Add in a great musical piece from Suggs, and you have a greatly overlooked gem of a comedy. "},{"Title":"Five stars or one star.   Can I give this movie four stars?","Date":"17 March 2004","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Wow -- talk about polarization.   I watched this 15 year old movie for the first time this past weekend and I thought it was terrific, gentle fun. Then I looked at the comments and found that it was tied with Citizen Kane with some viewers, but with Plan 9 from Outer Space with the rest. What is there in this little film that should polarize everyone so?Rowan Atkinson behaving like a creep?   Emma Thompson's 15-years-ago tush? Jeff Goldblum doing a pretty nice job as a vague almost-actor?   I think I will join the polarization here and state that I choose not to go to a party with those one star people.   I'll bet they just discuss poetry and stuff.How did I like this movie?   Let me count the ways? 1.  Funniest damned sex scene I can recall. 2.  Landlady-Carmen and friends -- what do you people mean, unnecessary character? 3.  Elephant!   Is that show coming soon to a theatre near me? 4.  Weak ending -- who cares?

Unfortunately Rowan Atkinson deprives us of seeing his real comic genius in full flight.Smith's film is very ridiculous - but that was probably the idea - and the comedy rather patchy, and often fairly stupid. Hilarity eventuates though, in the form of an unusual sex scene and a riotous sequence involving a nutty psychiatrist and a series of four needles.Friday, July 3, 1992 - Video "},{"Title":"not that remarkable a comedy","Date":"10 March 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" 'The Tall Guy' teamed several big names from British comedy together - Richard Curtis was writing, Mel Smith directing, Rowan Atkinson and Emma Thompson appearing on the screen. The nominal lead role went to American actor Jeff Goldblum.The flimsy plot concerned a patsy (Goldblum) playing straight man to funny performer Atkinson. There's a musical version of 'The Elephant Man' (which is quite funny and has echoes of 'The Man in the Moon' segment from 'Mame'); and a hilarious sex scene between Goldblum and Thompson around an entire room and over as many props as they could cram together.Not much of a film otherwise though, and Richard Curtis in particular went on to hit to the big-time cinema wise with such undemanding fare as 'Four Weddings', 'Notting Hill', and 'Love Actually'.

Original, if not entirely successful or satisfying British-made comedy hurt mostly by an overabundance of eccentric supporting characters (the main character's tics are enough to take on). Goldblum tries too hard; he's over-committed about being amiable on the screen, and is finally off-putting. Emma Thompson, sweetly cast as Goldblum's love-interest, is surprisingly at home here and ends up stealing the picture. ** from **** "}{"Title":"The worst movie that I have ever had the misfortune to see.","Date":"18 September 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  My head still aches from watching this travesty.

Jeff Goldblum is the title character, a Yank who sticks out like a sore thumb among the Brits. He works as the straight man for a stage comedian (played by Rowan Atkinson, and his fans will be disappointed that he's not featured more) and he falls for a blunt, independent-minded nurse (Emma Thompson) with whom he has a rocky romance.It's not the stars' fault, but this alleged romantic comedy doesn't really deliver much romance or comedy. Fans of Emma Thompson will want to see it just for her, but even her extraordinary talent isn't going to make a silk purse out of this script. A sex scene, of sorts, does prove one thing that many of us Thompson fans have been saying all along--she IS sexy! But that's about the biggest thrill you will get from this film. It's good for a few chuckles, but no guffaws.

Same schlubby hero, same no-nonsense heroine who knows absolutely that This Is The One. Same hero angst messing up the relationship. Same backdrop of other stuff going on.This movie is obviously a rough cut. The interactions are unbelievable, the backdrop (London Stage shows) are stupid and boring, and the chemistry between stars is Totally Lacking...but it's kind of interesting to study this side by side with Four Weddings and see how the writer matured.

I managed to crack a few smiles. But for those of you who find modern musicals (that is, since about West Side Story) pretentious and self-important, this movie contains a brilliant extended sendup of the genre. We've been subjected to musical Peronism, heard the Hunchback break into song, seen the Savior Himself presented as a rock star, and put up with the ridiculous chronicle of a deaf, dumb and blind kid who sure plays a mean pinball. Well, it was only a matter of time before they got around to the Elephant Man, in a musical called Elephant!--with the obligatory exclamation point.I can't remember how any of the songs go, but then I can't remember how any of the songs go in A Chorus Line either. When this happens in a real musical, one wishes for the days of Rodgers and Hart or the Gershwins. When it's a satire, it's hysterical. If in the middle of a movie about something else, they can throw together ten minutes worth of song and dialog that mimic the style so flawlessly, the works of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Stephen Sondheim are knocked down at least one peg. Couldn't happen to a nicer couple of guys.

She did.  In fact, nobody could bear to sink to such awful lows of bad comic farce in the presence of such a great personage, and once Emma arrived on the screen, the film actually became mediocre.  Even a few things that were supposed to be funny actually were mildly amusing, like the lampoon of the musical production.
