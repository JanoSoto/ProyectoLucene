[{"Title":"Hell on the Border","Date":"12 March 2006","Score":"68 out of 81 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Western","Review":" Hang 'Em High is a fictionalized account of Hangin' Judge Parker's court at Fort Smith, Arkansas. Judge Parker had jurisdiction over a large chunk of Indian Territory (Oklahoma today). The house of ill repute in the film is a fictionalized version of Miss Laura's Social Club which still stands in Fort Smith and has the dubious distinction of being the only whore house on the National Register of Historic Places. In the movie, Fort Smith becomes Fort Grant but a few of the place names used are actual names of towns nearby, such as Alma, Arkansas, and Poteau, Oklahoma. The river in Hang 'Em High is too small (even before the locks and dams) to be the Arkansas River but could stand in for the Poteau River; the confluence of the two rivers occurs at Belle Point in Fort Smith. Most of the movie was shot in California and New Mexico (certainly not eastern Oklahoma) but the scenes of the gallows and the judge's court and office look very much like Judge Parker's Court in Fort Smith that is also on the National Register of Historic Places. If not actually filmed there, then the producer and director did an excellent job recreating it as a set. Even the dungeon jail is correct.This was Clint Eastwood's first American western following his triumph in Sergio Leone's spaghetti western trilogy. Eastwood wanted Leone to direct this one but he was already committed to another project. From what I read neither Eastwood nor director Ted Post worked well with the producer/writer Leonard Freeman.Hang 'Em High starts out with a bang, a lynching that backfires. To show the audience that Jed Cooper (Clint Eastwood) is a good guy, Cooper rescues a calf from drowning. This ploy was later used in Tombstone when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), on his first appearance on screen, aids a horse that is being mistreated. Wyatt gives the perpetrator a taste of his own medicine reprimanding him, Hurts, don't it? Veteran actor Ben Johnson, who was from Oklahoma, happens on the scene while Cooper is still dangling, cuts him free, then throws him into the tumbleweed wagon full of thieves and cut throats bound for Fort Grant and justice. After lingering in the dungeon jail awhile, the judge clears Cooper and makes him a federal Marshall, warning him to bring the nine men in who attempted to hang him, but bring them in alive. The rest of the film deals with Cooper rounding up the nine plus a few other killers along the way. There is also emphasis on the different interpretation of justice by Cooper, a former lawman, and the judge. This leads to several dramatic confrontations. There is a parallel story of a search for justice by Rachel Warren (Inger Stevens)who falls for Cooper and visa versa. They have a thirst for vengeance in common.Much of the movie is fiction, but parts are based on history. The circus atmosphere that accompanied the public hangings in Fort Smith during Judge Parker's rule is shown basically as it has been reported. There were vendors present, hawking all types of goods and goodies. Children wandered around with or without their parents. The fathers would sometimes place their children on their shoulders so the tads could get a better view of the executions. And there were multiple hangings recorded, similar to the one in the film. The viewer may enjoy seeing a lot of familiar faces in the cast. Veteran actor Bob Steele plays Old Man Jenkins, a member of the lynching party. Bruce Dern is as ornery as they come. He is not only a member of the lynching party but a cold-blooded killer as well. Alan Hale, Jr. (The Skipper to his Little Buddy), one of the lynching party, is a blacksmith who seems apathetic to the incident. Dennis Hopper has what could be labeled a billed cameo role. The viewer barely sees his face at all. L.Q. Jones is a member of the lynching party turning in his usual fine performance. Charles McGraw plays the sheriff of Red Creek (possibly Garrison Creek, which today is Roland, Oklahoma) who has a back problem--or is it a spine problem? James MacArthur makes a solemn preacher extracting final confessions from the condemned. Pat Hingle portrays the hanging judge in fairly realistic terms. The real hanging judge never watched the condemned swing. Judge Adam Fenton not only watches but nods to the hangmen when to pull the lever. The masterful Ed Begley is the vicious leader of the lynching party who is determined to make amends for his botched hanging of Cooper by hanging him even higher next time. The lovely and sexy Inger Stevens turns in a winning performance as a supplement to Cooper's vengeance. And Clint Eastwood, well, he's Clint Eastwood. Need I say more?

It has the feel of a John Wayne western, as opposed to the spaghetti western formula in which Eastwood with Sergio Leone combined so magnificently with each other in the Dollars trilogy.Eastwood gives a very worthy performance as Marshall Jed Cooper. The central dilemma of having to operate within the law in conflict with his own personal view of justice is executed very well by Eastwood. On the whole, Eastwood's performance is certainly a strong point of the film and a great performance in its own right.The storyline itself is relatively well structured with interesting elements relating to the law and the justice system. However, a rather pointless, rushed and half baked romantic subplot by Inger Stevens (who is sadly woefully out of her acting league alongside Eastwood) adds nothing to the story and becomes rather annoying on repeat viewings.However, special mention must go to both Pat Hingle and Ed Begley who both give some excellent performances, perhaps even superior to Eastwood himself.Hang 'Em High is a great Eastwood western, provided you don't expect something magical like The Good, The Bad And The Ugly or Unforgiven. Entertaining and more complex than you would expect but sadly, greatly underestimated. Every Eastwood fan should at least give it a chance.Overall I give it a solid and well deserved 8/10. Be sure to get a copy of this hidden gem.

The first scene is a classic and the hanging scene in the somewhat middle of the film is very powerful and memorable. Dialogue is splendid and the acting is truly excellent. No need to mention Pat Hingle shines as Judge Fenton.Almost all of Eastwood's other American-made westerns did have that certain spaghetti-oriented feeling in them. Hang 'em high is perhaps perhaps the one that looks most like so-called traditional American western. However the role of Jed Cooper is like a tailor made for good-old Clint, or in this case young Clint. He's tough, charming and downright marvellous and once again he shows why John Wayne can kiss his boots.Hang 'em high is an exquisite experience, clever, deep, impressive and entertaining. Actually this is even better than Don Siegel's Two mules for Sister Sara and I loved it too. This is a movie that gets better every time you see it. If you didn't fully appreciate or understand it the first time you should watch it again and again and again and notice that every single time it offers something new to you.

He is rescued, eventually cleared of suspicion, and appointed deputy with 'a license to hunt' by a famous hanging-Judge Parker (Pat Hingle) with a clear warning All the criminals are to be taken alive for trial...Eastwood proceeds to clean up the worst crimes in the state, but doubting his own motives, he always avoids capturing the gang of nine vigilantes who were responsible for his near-death...Inexorably, the confrontation comes nearer. The leader of the gang, Captain Wilson (played by Ed Begley), returns to town and wounds Eastwood. This provides an encounter with another victim of the vigilantes, Rachel (Inger Stevens) who nurses Eastwood and reveals that the same gang raped her after murdering her husband...Eastwood's character is unlike Gregory Peck's character as the blind seeker of justice in The Bravados (1958), and much different for the 'Stranger.' He has now more dialog, he has a romance of sorts, and although he is equally proficient with the gun he always waited for the court's justice rather than dispensing his own, as he readily did in the Italian Westerns. He also exhibits less of the dry humor that had characterized the Stranger, and most sacrilegious of all, he has a name, Jed Cooper. Hang 'em High remains a study of differences between public and private forms of justice, but the motivations behind both are left confused and unsatisfying... The gripping mass execution on a big platform, is brilliantly directed by Ted Post, but the film has neither the magic or the mystique of a Leone film...

At first I thought it would be another ride 'em high, cowboys n' indians flick that was popular in America those days... before Sergio Leone shook the genre down to its raw and merciless possibilities.The film was pretty good, and the moral undercurrent of justice by a dirty rope on the plain, or a judge in a robe standing before the American flag is rather striking. The Federal judge is by far one of the most interesting characters I have seen yet in a Western.Indeed, the grittiest and most barbaric scene is not the lynching of an innocent man, but the public hanging on the eve of statehood... to prove that Oklahoma Territory executed the sort of justice required of a civilized state of the Union.  It is made a public spectacle with beautiful hymns and cold beer.  And just the way each of the condemned faces his execution is tongue in cheek.Then there was the campfire scene where Captain Wilson confers with his employees regarding their options irony, fear and desperation. They put a human face on their culpability, similiarly echoed decades later by Little Bill's I don't deserve this, I was building house. And the few who chose not to run chose a desperate and violent option.A dillemic no one wins justice spiralling into graphic violence... and ultimately an undiginified and graceless death.  What was perfected into poignant brevity by Unforgiven was born in Hang Em High's exploration of two men's differing approaches to an unforgiving justice... a justice that led either to the end of a noose, or the end of a gun.Not bad at all...

Hang 'Em High is a rather overlooked entry in Clint's long and impressive film wagon, even though it is a serious, no-nonsense and modest look at crime and punishment and a subtle dig at the injustice system, which was somewhat forgotten by his critics who emphasized that he was a symbol of violence, especially in the Dollars trilogy and the Dirty Harry series.Clint plays an ex-lawman who picks up a new badge after he is almost killed by a group of men who hang him and leave him for dead. He then embarks on a mission to hunt them down one-by-one and hand them over to the law.Ted Post's watchable Western drama is definitely a refreshing break from most other 'revenge' movies. Instead of cold-blooded vengeance, the script decides to display Clint's character, though still as the cold, silent anti-hero, as a more peaceful person who would truly like to see men behind bars rather than shooting them down. The film also keeps it grip, rarely letting a boring moment crawl in even though this is more talk than action.Its not a perfect, polished or particularly great film - the characterization always stays pretty low and the romance between Clint and the charming Inger Stevens isn't fully developed, for instance. However, it has its highlights - a memorable opening sequence and an effective musical score - along with its notable touch for seeing justice rather than violence and killing. A good effort that's worth watching and not ignoring.

First, he is hung (although they didn't get the job done) in a deputized mob lynching.  After he recuperates (the first time), he returns to his career as lawman to help a hangin' judge grease the wheels of justice.  Of course all that Cooper really wants is to see justice done to the mob that lynched him.  He soon finds out that his transgressors were men of the community or leading town folk.The irony is plentiful in this film.  For example, the two young men who go peacefully in an impossible 3 day ride, submit completely to the new Marshall.  How are they rewarded?  Well, they are hung of course!  This really sets the tone of the film.  The audience quickly recognizes that the hangin' judge just might me a bit too effective in his role of statemaker.While the movie does get a bit tedious, the story is razor sharp, the soundtrack is good although a bit epic, and the acting is very well done.One is left with a sympathy for the men Cooper is hunting.  Of course, this is a deliberate result of the filmmakers who meant this to be a commentary on capital punishment.  Well, I enjoyed the film despite the deeply woven propaganda.

His acting is about the same, maybe a little better, but it's nice to see his supporting cast is much more competent than what we'd been used to seeing. Pat Hingle, Charles McGraw, Bruce Dern and Eg Begley, Sr. all provide able support, as do lesser-known characters such as the good man about to be executed or the two young boys who assisted Dern in his cattle rustling.So apart from an able cast, why did I like it? Well, the story was the key. Clint Eastwood was wrongfully hung by a lynch mob at the beginning of the movie. He miraculously survives and becomes a lawman bent on apprehending the men who almost killed him. Despite this, Eastwood's character has depth and the movie really has something to say about frontier justice. Unlike some westerns, the bad guys are not ALWAYS killed by the Marshall but are brought to justice--which almost always means a hanging. Over time, Eastwood's lust for vengeance diminishes, as it's tough and not always a fair way to exact justice. You see and ultimately believe Eastwood's internal struggle.

Having had his story cleared Cooper is offered a job as a marshal and agrees to do it.  However when his first task is to arrest the men who hung him can he take the stand away from revenge and on the side of the law.I watched this cause I do like a good western every now and again.  The actual plot is quite simple on the surface &#150; man out for revenge, but it uses it quite well.  It makes some interesting parallels between the hanging of men by the lynch parties and the hanging of men by a judge.  It doesn't fully make it's point but it is good to have something to think about in a western.  Outside of this the film has some good drama even if the end feels more like the conclusion of an episode in a TV series rather than the finale of a film.Of course the reason for this may be Post's involvement as director.  He used to direct Rawhide with Eastwood and was picked for this film to support Eastwood.  This was his first American film after doing all those spaghetti westerns and I assume he wanted a familiar hand on the tiller.  He does well here as he always did with his western characters, I read that he also directed some of it.  The rest of the cast are made up of a few famous names (Bruce Dern, LQ Jones for example) but regardless everyone does well in their roles.It's not a classic western but it rises above the average by having a good lead in the shape of Eastwood and some plot strands that go beyond the revenge storyline and encourage you to think of deeper issues.

I was new to Eastwood's westerns, having just seen the Leone films for the first time. All I knew of this one was a scene that I had seen in television commercials, where Clint says the movie's most famous line When you hang a man you better look at him. So needless to say I was excited. The movie starts off well enough as innocent Eastwood is lynched by a group of men for cattle rustling, only he survives. From here you have a plot that Anthony Mann or Sergio Leone would have made into a masterpiece.Instead, what you get is a slow meandering film that fixates on and preaches about law & order, the dangers of vigilantism, etc. These kinds of plots were commonplace in virtually every western TV show from the 1950s and 60s. Hang 'Em High offers nothing new to a discussion that was already old by the time the film came out. Although I came into the movie predisposed to root for Clint, after awhile his character's lack of motivation at wanting revenge made me wish the lynch mob had done a better job and spared us an unfulfilling two hours.Like I said I first saw it in the 90s and was disappointed. I just recently rewatched it for the first time since then, hoping to see it with fresh eyes and enjoy it more. But I found myself feeling the same sense of disappointment and boredom I did all those years ago. As a western drama it's watchable and competently put together. As a western action revenge movie it's weak and should be avoided.

Literal in its approach but rambling in structure, 'Hang 'Em High' begins with the premise that Clint Eastwood will go out and seek revenge on the men who nearly killed him. And, well, for the next hour and forty-five minutes or so, that's pretty exactly what you see him do. In between rounds of 'justice,' the film gets bogged down with preachy passages condemning the rigidity of capital punishment and a half-baked subplot/love interest that doesn't begin until the film is nearly over and then doesn't amount to much. It was cheaply made with obvious painted backdrops outside open doorways and noticeably redressed sets. Also, it was sloppily assembled &#150; look for the film equipment under the hangman's scaffold.To compound things, the men Eastwood is out to get really aren't that bad. By and large, the posse that strung him up at the beginning did so only because they believed he was the man responsible for the killing of a well-respected rancher and his wife and a personal friend to most of the posse's members. With a few exceptions, the men were guilty of little more than overreacting and punishing the wrong person but doing so with honorable intentions. They should have been paid for this, but, frankly, I just never felt they deserved what they got.

I don't remember much of it then, and after having just picked it up on DVD, I can see why it's so forgettable.Visually, it looks like a western, and the opening scenes showcase some attractive western panoramas. Clint Eastwood does a decent job squinting and staring, but his persona is somewhat ruined by having a weak character by the middle of the movie. His motivations become unclear as the movie progresses, as the film tries to make a statement, but it isn't even sure what that statement is. A lot of viewers take something from it that it's anti-death penalty, but it's too muddied to even make that point well.The film starts off good, with good pacing, and with actors who melt into their new roles well. Alan Hale is instantly recognizable, but he fits into his role well, and was cast quite well. Several of the opening scenes are quite good. Many of the other character actors we see towards the beginning are familiar, including Bruce Dern, who also plays his role well.Rather quickly the film shoehorns Eastwood's character into a role he doesn't seem to belong in, and by the time Hingle's character is introduced, the office scenes were reminding me a lot of Hedley Lamarr in Blazing Saddles. Some of that resemblance is due to the film having a standard western look, some of it was due to boredom.The romance in the film seems entirely forced, and there are scenes where you wonder if the movie has just wandered off and forgotten the audience is watching. Or maybe they expect the audience to wander off, too.Something that is quite noticeable is the lack of any quotable lines. Outlaw Josey Wales, Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad & The Ugly, High Plains Drifter, Unforgiven, etc., all have quotable lines, ones that stick with you. Hang 'Em High doesn't. The few really good scenes in Hang 'Em High are blurred by the rest of the film's blandness.The music is quite good, but the lack of motivation for the characters really undercuts what otherwise would be powerful music. The music should augment and pump up the emotion felt by the audience about a character's motivation, but since the characters are often so lacking, the music seems to be playing to a different film - one you wish you were watching.For a good western about the questions of frontier justice, go see the Ox-Bow Incident. For good Eastwood westerns, go back to the Sergio Leone films or any of the others listed above. If you need filler to make a 24-hour Eastwood western marathon, use this one for early morning hours when no one's really watching.

In the meantime he encounters a bloodthirsty judge who sees it as his duty to bring law and order to a lawless territory by way of the rope, and a beautiful, mysterious woman seeking vengeance of her own.Unfortunately, the film falls short. The pacing is tortuously slow in all the wrong places, none of the shootouts are impressive or exciting, and there's not a single character worth caring about. What should have been a legendary classic was instead a two-hour bore. Even the love story between Rachel and Cooper is tepid at best.It should go without saying that Cooper gets his revenge, but the final scenes are completely anticlimactic and unsatisfying. His confrontation with the three surviving men who tried unsuccessfully to kill him not once, but twice, is a cakewalk and very short. There is no suspense and no real drama aside from a baffling conversation with one of his foes, whom he saves from suicide and then forgives for reasons that are never made clear.Hang 'Em High should have been great. It's certainly better than a typical spaghetti Western, but overall this is a dully plodding film that never really pulls us in.

I'm a Western fan in general, and I usually prefer Spaghetti Westerns to the American ones. Quite a bunch the American Westerns of the late 60s and early 70s took their influence from the success of the Italian Western, and Hang 'Em High certainly has some Spaghetti Western elements too. It is still obvious, that this is an American Western, however, Clint Eastwood's character of Marshall Jed Cooper is not an antihero with a sense of black humor such as The Man With No Name from the Dollar-trilogy was, but a tough man driven by the desire for justice.Jed Cooper (Eastwood) is lynched by a group of nine men for a murder he did not commit. Left hanging on a tree for dead, he is discovered by a Marshall, who cuts the noose and saves his life. The Marshall brings him to the town of Fort Grant, where the strict but idealistic Judge Adam Fenton (Pat Hingle) is to dispense justice for a huge area. After his innocence is proved, the former lawman Cooper is employed as a Marshall by judge Fenton, and he is now out to bring his own lynchers to justice. Lynchers who (as the tagline says) made two mistakes They hung the wrong man and they didn't finish the job...Clint Eastwood is great as always and he fits perfectly into his role of Marshall Jed Cooper. Pat Hingle delivers a great performance as Judge Adam Fenton (a role that is based on real life 'hanging-judge' Isaac Parker, as anyone who has read a bit about the American Old West will soon realize). Beautiful Inger Stevens is also very good, and lovable in the female lead. Ed Begley is great as the head lyncher. The cast furthermore contains Bruce Dern, Alan Hale Jr., LQ Jones and Dennis Hopper in a tiny, but good role. I also thought that Bert Freed did a great job as the hangman. Hwe probably didn't say a lot, but the way he looked and moved was just what his role demanded.The movie's score is pretty good, and fits into the movie perfectly, although it is obvious from the beginning to the end that they just wanted it to resemble Ennio Moricone's ingenious Dollar-trilogy scores. One of the main themes was actually just taken out of For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, and modified a little bit. I guess it's okay to try and copy the best, however, and the score certainly compliments the movie. Hang 'Em High is also very well photographed and atmospheric from the beginning to the end. There was a big resemblance to Sergio Corbucci's Spaghetti Western Masterpiece Il Grande Silenzio aka. The Great Silence from the same year in one scene, which I won't give away, watch both movies and you'll know what I mean.All said, Hang 'Em High is a great Western, which Clint Eastwood fans can't afford to miss.

What I found rather fascinating was the subtext provided by Pat Hingle's character, territorial Federal Judge Fenton. Deputizing Cooper, we see a solid moral individual who fairly demands that Cooper bring back his attackers alive to face a judge and jury. But this hanging judge has his own agenda, and in his vision of statehood for the Oklahoma Territory, he's not above creating a bit of a spectacle in the name of civilized justice. When Cooper gets sidetracked from his original mission to bring in the killer of a cattle rancher, his path crosses with Dern's character Miller, along with two young boys along for the ride. Though admitting to rustling, Cooper knows the boys are innocent of murder, especially when they don't help Miller take down Cooper while being brought in to Fort Grant. On the witness stand, Cooper is continually shut down by the judge as he tries to defend the boys. Legally they're guilty of rustling, punishable by death and they'll hang.Credit writers Freeman and Goldberg for an unusual and surreal scene in which six condemned men are about to hang. The camera glances on shadows of dangling feet that portend the actual hanging, as a crowd forms on a bright Sunday morning to witness death. They wear their Sunday best, as a vendor hawks cold beer as if it were a sporting event. As the judge nods his assent and the gallows claim their toll, three members of the Cooper hanging party attempt to gun him down before they themselves fall victim to the hunt - incredible timing and imagery as Eastwood's character falls in a hail of bullets.Inger Stevens appears as a nominal love interest for Marshal Cooper, in a romance virtually doomed from the start, as each are battling their own personal demons. Though there's a hint of their settling down together near the end of the movie, it's pretty much left up to the imagination of the viewer if that would ever actually happen.The actual ending is also an innovative piece of work. When Cooper was strung up and left for dead at the beginning of the movie, there were nine members of the hanging party. By story's end, seven had been accounted for, with six of them dead. Two members of the group, by name of Maddow and Charlie Blackfoot, decided to head out of town to avoid capture and trial. With his mission incomplete, Cooper picks up the badge once more and heads out on the trail to bring them in. Odds are he'll get his men, but we don't get to see it.

Pat Hingle is even better and just about steals the movie.","Date":"26 February 2004","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Western","Review":"  'Hang 'Em High' was Clint Eastwood's first American Western after working on Sergio Leone's groundbreaking Dollars trilogy. Some people describe it as an American attempt at a spaghetti western, but I really don't see it. Yes, it features a revenge theme, common to many spaghetti westerns, and it has a few moments of brutality and moral ambiguity, but really it's firmly in the tradition of the Hollywood Western. Leone was supposedly asked to direct but chose to make his masterpiece 'Once Upon A Time In The West' instead. Ted Post who directed 'Rawhide', the TV series which made Eastwood a star of the small screen, directed instead (Post and Eastwood would later be reunited with 'Magnum Force'). 'Hang 'Em High' is nowhere near as good as Leone's movies but it's still better than many would lead you to believe. Eastwood gives a good performance and the movie is jam packed with character actors and familiar faces. It starts off brilliantly with Eastwood being accused of stealing cattle by a posse (led by veteran Ed Begley, and including Bruce Dern and Peckinpah regular L.Q. Jones), and then hanged! Luckily Eastwood is saved by a wandering Marshall (Ben Johnson) and taken to prison. The local judge (Pat Hingle) frees Eastwood and offers him a job as a lawman, which he takes, using it as an opportunity to track down the hanging party who nearly killed him. Eastwood is good, but Pat Hingle is even better, giving a terrific performance of quite a complex character. Dern plays one of his patented scumbag roles, and Inger Stevens plays a local woman with a past who becomes Eastwood's love interest. I already mentioned legendary Western actors L.Q. Jones and Ben Johnson. Unfortunately Johnson doesn't get much screen time, but he does have a memorable scene with Dennis Hopper, who play a crazed character known as The Prophet. If you'd like to see more of these two actors together check out the rarely seen counter-culture Western 'Kid Blue' made in the early 1970s. I could go on and on about the supporting cast but I won't. Suffice it to say that film buffs will get lots of kicks watching this movie. 'Hang 'Em High' may not be close to Eastwood's best work, but it's still worth watching, for Pat Hingle if nothing else.

Hang 'Em High is a rather overlooked entry in Clint's long and impressive film wagon, even though it is a serious, no-nonsense and modest look at crime and punishment and a subtle dig at the injustice system, which was somewhat forgotten by his critics who emphasised that he was a symbol of violence, especially in the Dollars trilogy and the Dirty Harry series.Clint plays an ex-lawman who picks up a new badge after he is almost killed by a group of men who hang him and leave him for dead.  He then embarks on a mission to hunt them down one-by-one and hand them over to the law.Ted Post's watchable Western drama is definetly a refreshing break from most other 'revenge' movies.  Instead of cold-blooded vengence, the script decides to display Clint's character, though still as the cold, silent anti-hero, as a more peaceful person who would truly like to see men behind bars rather than shooting them down.  The film also keeps it grip, rarely letting a boring moment crawl in even though this is more talk than action.Its not a perfect, polished or particularly great film - the characterisation always stays pretty low and the romance between Clint and the charming Inger Stevens isn't fully developed, for instance.  However, it has its highlights - a memorable opening sequence and an effective musical score - along with its notable touch for seeing justice rather than violence and killing.  A good effort that's worth watching and not ignoring.

However, the marshall objects to the judge's eagerness to seemingly hang as many men as possible.The marshall, of course, is played by Clint Eastwood, in about the same way we've seen Eastwood play a dozen other roles.But Hingle has the prize role in this movie as the judge who has to find a way to live with himself as he sentences so many men to hang.

Do we care how many angels stand on the head of a pin...?","Date":"16 November 2011","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Western","Review":" Let's make no mistake this is a mediocre Eastwood's flick, one that even at times straddles turkey territory. And I blame for that his stubbornness at staying with the old, the proved, but also the discarded. After all, it's part of movie History that by the early 1960s the traditional Western was as good as dead and that it was Leone who single handedly brought it back to life. So, it is a perplexing irony that the man charged of creating the most iconic character of the genre, the one who after him was crucial in creating a new Western, may have been also the only one not noticing the breathtaking change. After all, other U.S. filmmakers were at the time breaking new ground, experiencing with such daring movies as Butch Cassidy & Sundance Kid, Wild Bunch, etc. But I don't think that in Eastwood's case it was lack of awareness, but that he was simply trying to redeem himself in front of his conservative U.S. TV audience, after his Italian escapade--during which his Manco had broken every Hollywood convention; to show them that nothing had changed after all. But as Mrs. Sheen, Duvall, realized after their own AN escapade, doing movies for forgiveness doesn't really work, the resulting product being usually some contrived clunker. HTH follows the same protocol and it pays dearly for that, because it ends up being overdone, unoriginal, lame. Judging by what we see here, it would seem that by 1968 Eastwood wanted nothing to do with the film revolution he had been instrumental in unleashing and with the lasting icon he had created, El Manco.Basically HTH is just a throwback to older times when audiences were holding their breaths agonizing about the legality of what some generic sheriff was doing with his posse or about some cattle being properly branded; or wondering if the guys rotting in jail were really guilty...yawn. That's about this plot also. Cattle owner and former Marshall Cooper is mistakenly accused of murder & cattle rusting and hanged by a rogue posse. Miraculously, a traveling Marshall saves him. Then, as the truth comes out he's re--hired as a lawman and he'll spent the rest of the movie--when not chasing outlaws--arguing with people, from the judge above him to some other Marshall, to commoners, about the right way of enforcing the law. In that settings it's not surprising that, more than anything else, this movie feels like a pamphlet on good citizenry or at least as a simple remake of Ox Box Incident or some other classic--and not a very good one at that--rather than like an action & tension filled Western.But the worse thing about it is that it's preachy and manipulative, specially during that onion juice sprinkled picnic scene and during the collective hanging bit. Both episodes fail to convey any deep feeling, to communicate the desired emotions, because they feel to much the contrived--my Suspension of Disbelief Meter stayed stubbornly stuck at 0--so they both fall flat, as most of the flick. What makes things even worse is CE's clear intent of making us forget his Manco roles, which leads him to exaggerate the cleanliness and poise of his character. Always well dressed when about town, wearing just washed & ironed shirts, impeccable pants, immaculate hats...can you believe I spent more time watching in awe that wondrous hairdo than following the plot, the action, paying attention to the acting? That says more about this movie than anything else, I guess.Now, when a flick drags on the romance may come to save the day, but here even that doesn't work because that love story is simply BORING. I don't know about Stevens-maybe she was considered hot in the 60s--but here they both provide for what must be the lamest romantic couple in History, dethroning Cabaret's Minelli/York and Eternal Sunshine's Winslet/Carrey. And age got nothing to do with it in a similar role in Open Range, Annette Benning sets the screen on fire but here we see nothing of the kind. Her character is overloaded with pathos yet she plays it casually; nowhere her eyes, attitude, match what should be the cold resolve of her persevering endeavor which makes her look like just searching for some lost relative or like a preacher searching for lost souls--as Joan Collins in that Star Trek episode--which I thought is was the case! Furthermore her subplot gets no denouement, which makes it rather superfluous. The true mystery is why Eastwood's Cooper falls for her after all--maybe it's just that she brings out his inner lame-o. In any case, his final decision about keeping after the bad guys rather than staying with her, instead of looking and feeling as heartbreak, makes all the sense in the world.BTW, the only reason I saw and reviewed this one is because I found it in a 4-DVD set, with Leone's trilogy, under the description 4 Eastwood Classics. Uh, I don't think so. Just make that 3 Classics and a Lame-o. 5/10.

However, Cooper survives this hanging and once his innocence has been proved, Judge Fenton (Pat Hingle) makes Cooper a lawmen and tasks him with the job of bringing all the men back to him alive so that they can be brought to justice.Hang 'Em High is another in a long line of Eastwood westerns and to date this is probably the weakest offering that I've seen. The problem I found with this film is that is that the story just wasn't all that engaging. At close to 2 hours it's far too long and I just found that so many elements of the film seemed to be drawn out for no real reason (the scene involving a group of men being hung about halfway through the film is a case in point). It also wasn't particularly exciting or entertaining and Eastwood is saddled here with a character that has no real character - no one-liners or humorous moments. This all just made the film rather dull. Director Ted Post also showed a lot of close-ups of several cast members which may have been the 'in thing' and I suppose it was intended to create suspense and tension, but looking at it today it looks ridiculous and rather cheesy.Where this film does deserve some praise is in the way that the writers expose some of the flaws in the justice system. Cooper is also a man that finds that his heart is telling him to get revenge on the men that left him for dead, but finds his head and conscience is telling him that they should be brought to justice and let the justice system decide their fate. This is an interesting aspect to the story which sadly for me didn't quite get enough focus.What makes this film slightly more disappointing is the final showdown which lacked any sort of intensity and was very anti-climactic.Taking everything into account, Hang 'Em High is an underwhelming and slightly disappointing film that just isn't as compelling or entertaining as many of Eastwood's other westerns.

How would you feel? What would it do to your character? Would it scar you for life, or would you be able to move on?Those of us who've been through that scenario time and again know the answer. At times you can. At other times you want to chew nails and spit them out at the world for all the wrong doing you've suffered. But you endure. One scar may heal, another not as much. In the end they both fade, but just make sure you don't create new scars wen trying to heal the old. So it is that Eastwood's character gets caught up in a crime that he did not commit, and winds up vindicating himself by bringing others to book for it. We have a man on a mission with scars that will probably never heal. Scars that will, in an ironic sense, keep him going for the rest of his life. We witness a portion of that life as he engages in the healing process by taking up the tin star one more time and administering local town law on a Federal level.This is a comment on the human spirit, and also a comment on so called street justice, those who engage in street justice, and the ultimate outcome where the law is concerned.Those of us who in years past were fingered for wrong doing know the consequences of people jumping to conclusions. The cinematic mind conjures odd scenarios, and brings forth outcomes that seem likely, but are in truth fantasy. Yet the crowd is caught up in the trend. Others believe in their conviction that the focus of their attention is a wrong doer, or they don't want to stand out in the crowd for fear of being wrong. Those of us who've stood up to such persecution have weighed our options and suffered for it, but have thought of the more rational cause for the group psychological mayhem.But it doesn't do a man good when surrounded by a posse with the intent to be judge, jury and executioner. Fortunately it's Clint, and Clint will survive to see that justice is done (to borrow from the phrasing of the time). Well acted, well costumed, superb sets and locations, this film is a top notch western like most westerns of the time. I used to watch it regularly from Sacramento the Bay Area, along with a huge number of other westerns.On an odd and perhaps tangential note, and I'm sure some reviewer somewhere here on this website or elsewhere, has pointed out the similarities between this character and the infamous man with no name who rode into town in Pale Rider, as well as a couple of other westerns Clint has done. In my book this seals the deal of who that man is and was. Ergo, the mystery is solved in terms of Clint Eastwood's character lore.The film itself does get sidetracked for a bit with the woman who comes in to help him mend.

He is rescued, becomes a lawman and owes to hunt the members of the mob down. He is convinced by Judge Fenton (Pat Hingle) that the men should get a trial and it is for the law to punish them. After witnessing a few trials and public hangings, he realizes that the law is not all fair either.Judging by today's standards this justice system may look like a Kangaroo's court. But, is it really as barbaric as it seems to be. In the crime-riddled Old West, some tough decisions had to be made. These include making an example of crime-doers to deter others from repeating the same. Judge Fenton even explains to Cooper that he does not enjoy handing out harsh punishments but it is the only way for a better future. The greater good, you may call it. This is not a Spaghetti Western, as maybe expected since it stars Eastwood. It is a like the classic westerns in that it raises ethical questions. Eastwood does a great job as a man undergoing an internal conflict while maintaining a no-nonsense demeanor.

When is violence right or wrong? Should there be a point where violence has to be stopped? What are the consequences of violence? These ambiguous interpretations emphasised Hang 'Em High's harrowing and confrontational portrayal of a violent frontier.Mistaken for a wanted murderer Jed Cooper (Clint Eastwood) is left hanging from a tree by a posse bent on delivering 'justice'. Understandably affected by his near-death experience, Jed becomes Deputy Marshall at the behest of Judge Fenton (Pat Hingle) to make the posse accept their consequences even if it means death. However along the way Jed becomes at odds with Judge Fenton regarding violence's complex nature. A Western setting is appropriate to play out Hang 'Em High's themes of violence. A harsh terrain unforgiving of the devoid characters occupying its space which Jed was against perfectly back-dropped the violence. Undertaking three prisoners to face trial, Jed comes up against Miller (Bruce Dern) the most experienced of these prisoners. When Miller tries killing Jed it leads to a fantastic fight sequence, intensified by their opposing personalities. Once Miller realises he's lost the fight, he tells Jed to kill him. Instead Jed ties Miller on a horse intent on Miller facing the law. What makes this scene powerful is the variations of violence at play. Miller knows the consequences of his violence will lead to his execution whereas Jed will not commit violence upon Miller as an easy way out from execution. Hang 'Em High offers violence's portray to audiences with the same complexity as the characters dealing with it through Hang 'Em High's narrative. Whilst we can cheer Jed's revenge, we also have time to reflect upon other forms of violence in Hang 'Em High such as public executions. Clearly presented to be morally questionable with shots of children on a family outing to see condemned men being put to death, the bizarre fulfilment gained from witnessing their executions. Hang 'Em High has to be commended for offering this space of thought to audiences. On a side note a love interest develops between Jed and Rachel (Inger Stevens), a woman with her own checkered past. But this happens with little convincibility and takes place too late in the narrative to be heartfelt. Overall Hang 'Em High should be thought of as tackling variations of violence.

Luckily, there is some depth and interest under the surface; while some of it is pretty standard in terms of the romantic relationship that unfolds between Inger Stevens (a good, not great, counterpart for Eastwood), or her own back-story with one of the main villains of the piece played by Ed Begley, there is a sense of dread raised by what it means to be the law or have some righteous claim of justice in this unclaimed territory of Oklahoma.In fact, nearly every scene between Eastwood and Pat Hingle rests on a rift that grows more and more over who has more right to exact justice we side with Eastwood on one side, and on Hingle with another- that is until we see the enormity of the people who arrive to see six people being hanged after Eastwood brings in three of the perps (two of which, according to the conflicted Marshall, doesn't think deserve to be hanged). At heart Hang em High still endorses Clint going after the bad dudes with his squint and hardened face that says I mean business, but it also shows him playing a character who has principles, and some that conflict with what should be the just law of the land and instead (somewhat) secretly relishes hammering down perps to the ground with his gavel. This is the great moral strength of the picture.As for it being a Western?

Freeman was the screen writer for Hawaii Five O. Not surprisingly Dan-O (James MacArthur) played a preacher in this movie. I personally believe that this movie must have been filmed right before starting on Hawaii Five-O. Freeman probably brought MacArthur (adopted son of Helen Hayes)along to be the side kick to Jack Lord.In any case, this movie appears to be a right-wing, pro-hanging movie. I think this is mistaken. Freeman was a great moralist. He wasn't so much politically driven, as trying to get at the heart of human issues. This is very apparent in this film. At the beginning of the film, Eastwood's character is hung by a group of individuals for being a rustler. The mob is not completely off-base, because Eastwood's character did unknowingly buy cattle from someone who pretended to be someone whom he had just murdered (and stolen his cattle).Eastwood's character is named Cooper. He is a former lawman. While being slowly and agonizingly hung, a marshall (played by the late great Ben Johnson) comes to his rescue. Cooper vows revenge on the nine men who hung him. First however, Cooper is brought to trial. When entering the town, the marshall is told by the bully pulpit justice for the Oklahoma territory (Played by Pat Hingle) to go get a dangerous criminal out of the barn. The ruffian is played by Dennis Hopper. Hopper's character tries to run and is shot by the marshall. At first the prisoners are egging the marshall (Johnson) to shoot the prisoner (Hopper). When Johnson does, all the prisoners realize that the marshall was actually being a coward, and are shocked by the killing.The justice (Hingle) finally verifies that Cooper is innocent, and saves him from hanging. The justice hangs people for even minor crimes. He is the law of the territory, and the justice believes that this is the only way to rule the Oklahoma territory (a viper's nest of law and disorder). Eastwood is enlisted by the justice to become a marshall. However, the justice is shrewd enough to know why, and warns Eastwood to bring all nine of the men who tried to hang him unharmed.One of the nine guys is played by Bruce Dern. Dern plays an immoral, sneaky, devious man, who will kill a person if given even a second of freedom. Somehow, Cooper manages to capture him. However, two other men he captures aren't really men. They are teens. Cooper believes their story that they were tricked and lured into joining the gang of rustler.Near the end of the movie, Dern's character and the youths are hanged. It is a tense and contradictory moment, as religious hymns are song by the townspeople and the preacher (MacArthur) reads his sermons. Of course, in the end Cooper gets all nine of the culprits.However, the plot is not the real story. It is the moral complexity of the plot that is the real story. No event is as simple as it seems. The posse that attempts to hang Cooper is a complex lot. Some are good family men. They find themselves on the defensive just because Cooper is after them. It is not an absolute clear cut case of Cooper the good guy and they the bad guys. It is more grey than that.The question of justice is extremely complex. Cooper and the justice (Hingle) argue endlessly over the fate of the two teenagers. Cooper believes their lives should be spared. The justice thinks until Oklahoma becomes a state, punishment is the only way. So, in conclusion, rather than being a right wing law in order movie, this movie is more of a philosophical debate over law and order. "},{"Title":"You've come to kill the prophet!

And when it was released in the late summer of 1968, with not even a year yet past the release of the final film of the Leone period (THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY), more than one critic claimed that HANG 'EM HIGH was really nothing more than a cash-in on those spaghetti westerns. But anyone who really sees this movie all the way through will only notice peripheral references to Eastwood's past.Eastwood portrays an ex-lawman driving cattle across the Oklahoma territory who is set upon by a group of vicious rustlers (led by Ed Begley), who have pegged him as the murderer of the family from whom he got those cattle. This being a largely lawless territory, they decide to hang him. But they make two mistakes. One, they hang the wrong man; and two, they don't even bother to finish the job. A local marshal (the always-reliable Ben Johnson) cuts him loose from the noose, and takes him to Judge Fenton (Pat Hingle), who, after checking out his story and confirming its factuality, makes him a marshal and assigns him the task of bringing in the rustlers who tried to kill him, but bringing them in alive. This is so Hingle can try them, and then hang 'em--and hang 'em high!While this may seem like an Americanized version of a spaghetti western just because Eastwood is in it, HANG 'EM HIGH has a bit more in common with the 1948 film THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, and is nowhere near as violent as the Leone films were. There's no doubt that it's a revenge story, but Eastwood's thirst for vengeance is directed only specifically at Begley and his henchmen (including Alan Hale Jr., Bruce Dern, and L.Q. Jones, formidable opponents all); and he shows mercy to the old man (Bob Steele) of the lynching party because he warned Begley that they were hanging the wrong man. The real focus of HANG 'EM HIGH, made rather clear but not in an overtly explicit way, is how the line between good and evil, right and wrong, is a very fine line that often gets crossed for misguided reasons. Hingle's hanging judge seems to take pleasure out of seeing all lawbreakers hang in the Fort Grant town square; but as he sees it, until Oklahoma is made into a state and a court of appeals is put in place, he alone is the law. Eastwood, however, knows the limits of the law and justice.Ted Post, who had directed Eastwood in a couple of episodes of the actor's TV series Rawhide and who made his big-screen directing debut here, occasionally overuses the zoom lens and shock cuts during the hanging sequences, possibly in imitation of Leone. But this is a minor flaw, given the complex nature of the Mel Goldberg/Leonard Freeman screenplay, and Eastwood's solid characterization. Eastwood, so often pegged as being every bit the political right-winger that John Wayne was, was even then a much more complex figure than Wayne ever was on the Duke's best day. With a cast that includes Inger Stevens, Charles McGraw, Arlene Golonka, and Michael O'Sullivan, a fine score by Dominic Frontiere, and total on-location shooting in southern New Mexico, HANG 'EM HIGH shows itself to be much more than an American rehash of Leone. In its own underrated fashion, it points to the kind of actor AND director Eastwood would become in the decades that followed.

I've noticed in a few of Clint Eastwood's movies that inappropriate sex with Clint Eastwood seems to solve a lot of problems (see Blood Work...or rather, don't).

After the success of the Dollars trilogy he jumps back into the genre with a movie which thoroughly disappoints. This is a slow, dull, quite tedious film. Not much interesting happens. Honestly not much of anything happens. Drama and excitement are in desperately short supply. The big action sequences you expect from such a film never arrive. The characters are not compelling, the story is paper-thin and the supposed climax is totally anticlimactic. Very hard to find anything good to say about this one.In this film Eastwood's character actually has a name. He's Jed Cooper and soon after we meet him Jed finds himself swinging from a tree with a rope around his neck. A posse, thinking him to be a cattle rustler and a murderer, hangs him. They do a rather lousy job of it. A federal Marshal shows up, cuts down the still very much alive Cooper and brings him before a judge. This judge likes to hang pretty much anyone brought before him but he realizes Cooper's innocence and actually makes Cooper a Marshal. And from there things go about as you would expect, Cooper hunting down the men who lynched him, seeking vengeance. Sounds like it could be interesting but it doesn't turn out that way. The fact the bad guys are such bumbling, bungling idiots doesn't help. Given another chance to kill Cooper they fail even more miserably than the first time. They really are quite pathetic. If you can't take the bad guys seriously it's near impossible for this type of movie to succeed. And that's the case here. The film's central conflict is a letdown. And there's nothing else to prop the film up. A tepid love story falls completely flat. The hanging scenes (and with this judge in town there are plenty of opportunities for hanging scenes) are interminable. Eastwood is reasonably decent in his role but no other performer really makes a mark. Some, most notably Ed Begley as the lead bad guy, miss the mark entirely. Getting through this film is really a chore. There's no suspense, the drama drains away all too quickly. This is not a good film. In fact it's quite bad. You might even call it ugly.

While heading his herd out in the country he is challenged by 9 men who happen to come upon him. After disarming him they demand to see his bill-of-sale, which he produces. But the bill-of-sale is bogus and so they hang him not realizing that the man who gave it to him had just murdered the real owner of the cattle and was more than willing to get the cattle off of his hands for cash. The lynch mob rides off and immediately afterward Marshal Dave Bliss (Ben Johnson) sees Jed Cooper hanging from a tree and manages to resuscitate him. After hauling him into Fort Grant to determine his guilt or innocence for any crimes committed, Jed Cooper is set free. But more than that, because of his background as a lawman he becomes a marshal as well. And he is intent upon finding the 9 men who hung him. At any rate, rather than revealing any more of the plot and spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is the first non-Spaghetti western that Clint Eastwood starred in and it definitely has a more American flavor. Clint Eastwood puts on an excellent performance as a man determined to see justice served. Pat Hingle (as Judge Fenton) performs quite well too. Along with that both Inger Stevens (as Rachel Warren) and Arlene Golonka (as the prostitute named Jennifer) add some nice scenery as well.

It's as if MGM was trying to be cautious about the inevitable bloodletting, which doesn't hold a candle to the violence in Eastwood's spaghetti westerns. He also is clean shaven and neatly attired here, a marked departure from his rough and ready character in the Italian films. Last but not least, the film ends in midstride, with Eastwood still pursuing some of the baddies. It's as if a sequel were planned. At times, the movie feels like a TV job. Fortunately, Eastwood went on to star in some of the most memorable 20th and 21st century westerns, war, action, crime and comedy films -- and he hasn't stopped to this day.

It has a plot that almost writes itself Eastwood starts the film by being mistaken for a cattle rustler, at which point he's lynched without trial. He somehow survives, and ends up becoming a marshall, vowing to track down the gang responsible.That storyline is standard revenge fare for the genre, but two things lift this film above the norm the style and the musings on capital punishment. As well as the various lynchings, one of the main characters (the great Pat Hingle) is a hanging judge and a (legal) execution sequence is the film's most powerful and harrowing shot. As for the style, for much of the film the action carries along to a loud, crashing score which I loved and which suited the events perfectly.Eastwood plays one of his sternest characters yet, a man always cheating death and driven by vengeance; there's little of his laidback, laconic charm from the Leone trilogy. The supporting cast is excellent tragic actress Inger Stevens makes her mark as a woman whose life is driven by her own dreams of revenge, there are tons of western actors present (Ed Begley, Ben Johnson, Bruce Dern, L.

I'd much rather watch an actor like Clint, John Wayne, or Bruce Willis, who make me pay attention to such subtleties, than watch one who mugs for the camera, and exaggerates every expression.

It is not, however, a place whose reputation and immense grip of fear is put upon its inhabitants by gunslingers or bandits &#x96; rather, the actual state itself and the law enforcers whom sentence those to death not with a six-shooter but with a gavel; they do not thieve and pillage people's lives of earnings or possessions, rather their lives in a literal sense in that their gleeful carrying out of death sentences and public hangings linger over the people of this vast land as an ultimate form of threat for no good-doers. The film is an interesting mediation on absolute power seemingly corrupting a man, absolutely; somebody in ultimate control of a territory all too keen to reek havoc on an array of people whom live there in his charging them of crimes they may have, or may not have, committed. Post, working from a screenplay penned by Leonard Freeman and Mel Goldberg, paints an as disenchronian-a world of the Wild West as possible, but one that is such by way of the law and those that judge the people whom break it rather than those willing to go out of their way to make others' lives a misery.Where Hang 'em High has the bulk of its fun is in a central character whom opposes this status-quo, whom is wronged but sticks to a liberal mindset and thus challenges the state's own firm position. That lead is Clint Eastwood's Jed Cooper, the film beginning with the man erroneously stumbling across some trouble as he herds cattle; trouble that does not arrive in the form of thieves or bandits in the traditional sense but marshals whom accuse him of rustling, murder and consequently hang him there and then. Cooper's wading through the river he's crossing when we first observe him will come to resemble the long, slow trek through the misadventure born out of his ill-informed hanging; whereas on another early occasion we form opinions on him of being of a kind and perhaps well mannered sort when he watch him aid a young calf additionally having trouble crossing through the water. He helps young and defenceless animals in times of peril, how can this man possibly be a murderer and a thief? After being saved by another lawman prior to choking to death, a man whom gleefully arrives with a waggon full of law-breakers, the film takes us to the iron-fisted; authoritarian; no-nonsense headquarters of judge Adam Fenton (Hingle) operating out of a nearby fort a man that towers over all in his courtroom dishing out death sentences to all of those that stand before him. The place of law practise is a seedy, dystopian little locale posing as something far more righteous; the practising of the hanging of the prisoners played out just outside the holding cell as large sacks are used instead of human bodies those locked away able to hear the sickly noise of what their fate will sound like when the time comes. Within this world, and despite its strict law abiding characteristics, the interiors are lavish and relatively rich in appearance; the people living there eat well and the woman are fairly glamorous in their appearance suggesting a functioning world underneath this grip of terror and power.The mistake is acknowledged, Cooper is set free and there's an odd sense that degrees of either anger or frustration on Fenton's behalf in that one has slipped through the proverbial net is apparent; nicely put across via the acting of Pat Hingle. The warning of the pratfalls of vigilantism is verbally dished out to Cooper, the notion of Cooper being back in front of him in the courtroom to instead face certain death being the threat if he decides to get even with those whom wronged him; Cooper is instead made a marshal. The location of those Cooper is after, not to kill but to bring to some kind of justice; the antithesis to what they brought unto him in the form of what they thought was the justifiable thing, is highlighted on the huge map of the region which dominates Fenton's wall as much his figure does in the courtroom. The magnitude of the job in finding them in and around this area put across as rather immense and made to look thoroughly difficult.The film comes to resemble one man's quest for justice, the item of vigilantism or vigilantes themselves effectively rendered the enemy of the whole thing; the first meeting with one of the nine shamed lawmen ending in conflict and death, but only through self defence on Cooper's behalf further adding a sense of the man treading on a very fine line given what is at stake if found in the wrong in this teetering roost ruled in a totalitarian manner. It is a quest which sees the film drag Cooper off on a separate tangent in order to find the murderers of an individual's brother and father, given his role as a marshal, and allows the film to provide us with Cooper's own, more methodical, approach to bringing the perpetrators of crime to justice in a more measured and more liberal manner - something that clashes with the majority of the others Fenton employs. Whilst on the separate strand, Cooper comes to form a bond with a young woman named Rachel (Stevens) &#x96; the ease of their friendship enhanced by the fact both of them share a past of being wronged in different ways by a rather large group of people, whom then got away, before they themselves being left for dead. Hang 'em High is a taut piece of drama, nicely blending in an array of characters and their stories with an interesting mediation on power and control.

Massachusetts had to disgorge Maine in 1820 to balance the admission of Missouri into the Union that year. A western state called Franklin in the 1780s was replaced by Kentucky (1792) and Tennessee (1796). Virginia seceded from the Union in 1861 with most of the South. It's western counties seceding from it and rejoining the Union as West Virginia in 1863. And all these secessions were in the states east of the Mississippi!Texas entered in 1845 in a last battle of John Tyler's administration. California required the Compromise of 1850 to enter. Then pro-abolition states came in to the anger of the South (Oregon - 1858; Kansas in 1861, Nevada in 1864). Following the Civil War Nebraska (1867) and Colorado (1876), entered, but they had loyally supported the Union. Nebraska even named it's capital after Lincoln.The other territories languished. There were population problems, Indian problems (which were twisted to suit the settlers and Eastern interests), and law and order problems. Also one religious problem Utah had the population for decades but was suspect because of Mormonism (and had been tepid in supporting the North in the war). It would not be until 1889 - 1890 that the statehood issue finally got pushed by President Benjamin Harrison. He had served as Chairman of the Westen Territory Committee of the U.S. Senate. Harrison would steer the admission of six states (the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and Washington) through the Congress between 1889 and 1890. This was the biggest admission of any set of states in a Presidential term in our history. Only the still unloved Utah languished - and would do so until polygamy was formally abolished. In 1896 President Cleveland got the state in. Oklahoma was seen as an Indian enclave. The territory was actually called the Indian Territory. Because of that it was hard to get much going in the way of local government from non-Indian settlers. The territory was a good haven for criminals, the most notable being Butch and Sundance and their gang. But this was going to end with Harrison, who early in his Presidency organized the famous Oklahoma Land Rush (1889). This gave an acceptable settler basis for the territory, and in 1907 Theodore Roosevelt got Oklahoma into the Union. New Mexico and Arizona entered in 1912, under William Howard Taft.Due to the wild nature of the Oklahoma Territory Justice Parker was given the job of enforcing law and order. He was just the right man for it - he was known as Hanging Judge Parker. It wasn't that Isaac Parker liked to hang people, but he was sternly enforcing the law on many desperadoes. His headquarters, by the way, was in Arkansas - which should show how dangerous the territory was.The plot of HANG 'EM HIGH is as follows Clint Eastwood is Cooper, who is captured on the road by a lynch mob like in THE OX-BOW INCIDENT. This mob, led by Ed Begley Sr. (as Captain Wilson) has no Harry Davenport, Henry Fonda, or Harry Morgan to try to restrain it's bloodthirsty attitude. On weak circumstantial evidence they string up Eastwood but the rope breaks. Begley and his mob leave Eastwood to strangle to death. Instead he is rescued by a U.S. Marshall (Ben Johnson). Taken to see Hinkle, Eastwood is proved to be innocent. He takes a job as a deputy to go and bring in the lynch members as well as others. He does so, but while he is efficient in capturing these men he slowly gets to hate the job. He is also softened by meeting another criminal violence victim, Inger Stevens (whose husband was murdered), whom he falls in love with. Eastwood slowly questions the good of the executions, and Hinkle keeps defending them. I am amazed this western is not grabbed by the anti-capital punishment people as good propaganda about the value of executions. It is harder and harder to watch the film progress while we get to know the various members of the lynch mob (most of whom are not bad people), as well as other desperadoes who get executed. Probably the reason is Hinkle's really good performance (probably his best - his one in THE STRANGE ONE is almost as good) as Judge Fenton. Fenton knows that there are bad elements that have to be put down if this territory is ever to be admitted into the U.S., and it can't be allowed perpetual independence because it would be a magnet for all foes of organized government. I do agree, but even so the sight of the legally doomed is upsetting. One realizes lesser penalties were called for in many cases. Also, Begley is unrepentant to nearly the end - he won't admit he went too far in stringing up Eastwood (basically his view is the same as Hinkle's, except his posse wasn't a legal one). The ten minute segment that ends with Begley's end is stark and ironic.By the way, in this film one of the doomed defendants is played (with gallows humor) by James Westerfield, whose face and features popped up in many a western (or movie for that matter) until his death in 1972. In 1969 he appeared in TRUE GRIT - as Judge Parker!

The dozen in the posse hang him.Up to now this sounds like The Oxbow Incident. But unlike what happened to Dana Andrews, Anthony Quinn, and Francis Ford a very old and fraying rope was used. Eastwood's neck doesn't snap and the group don't wait until he chokes to death. He survives and becomes a man with a mission.The nicest part for Eastwood is he gets to do his mission with the imprimatur of the law. The best performance in the film comes from Pat Hingle who's a no-nonsense hanging federal judge in the territory. He intends to see that laws are enforced and justice is swift. Besides Hingle and Bailey, director Ted Post gives Eastwood a good cast of film and TV regulars in support. The tragic Inger Stevens is his leading lady here, a woman who's got a vengeance quest of her own going and who really does understand what makes Clint tick. This was one of her last films, she was a troubled and tragic woman in life. A very sad loss.Clint's legion of fans will love this one.

His innocence is proved and Judge Fenton invites Copper to the position of deputy marshal to help him to implement the law in the large area. Cooper accepts the position and chases the vigilantes with the warrants of Judge Fenton. Meanwhile the leader of the lynchers, Captain Wilson (Ed Begley), realizes that they have committed three mistakes they returned the money Jed Cooper had paid for the cattle expecting to get rid off him; they hung an innocent man; and they did not complete their task.Hang' Em High is a different western disclosing a period when law and justice were in the beginning of implementation in the Wild West. The characters performed by Clint Eastwood and Pat Hingle have an interesting duel, with Marshal Jed Cooper following the traditional procedure of justice by his own hands, while Judge Fenton is concerned in introducing law and order to a wild place.

During this time he worked with many a seasoned guest star while learning his craft. In 1964 while still working on the TV series he starred in a trio of Spaghetti Westerns for Italian director Sergio Leone. In those pictures he played a no nonsense fast on the draw drifter. The films were not released in the US until after Rawhide had finished.For his first American film following the Leone trilogy, Eastwood chose Hang 'em High. In it he played a character that he would play with variations for most of the rest of his career (see Dirty Harry).The opening sequence has cattleman Jed Cooper (Eastwood) being lynched for cattle rustling by a vigilante group headed by Captain Wilson (Ed Begley). Leaving him for dead the group rides off. Cooper is rescued by Marshal Dave Bliss (Ben Johnson) and is taken in a prison wagon to Judge Fenton's (Pat Hingle) jail. The judge verifies Cooper's innocence and sees in him a potentially great lawman. The judge you see, has jurisdiction over a large area and needs able bodied lawmen to enforce the law.Cooper of course wants to seek out those who had lynched him but the judge cautions him over using the law to gain his revenge. But as we would come to know, no one escapes Clint Eastwood's justice.Hang 'em high was directed in a Leone style by Ted Post who had directed Eastwood in several episodes of Rawhide An able cast of Hollywood veterans was assembled to play the various supporting roles. Inger Stevens plays a bitter widow who checks out the prison wagons in search of her husband's killer. Charles McGraw plays spineless Sheriff Ray Calhoun who refuses to aid Cooper in his quest and Bruce Dern plays the slimy outlaw Miller who leads two naive young men to their doom.Others in the impressive cast include veteran Bob Steele in one of his best latter day roles, Alan Hale Jr. as the town blacksmith, Dennis Hopper in a brief bit as a mad prophet, James MacArthur as a preacher and James Westerfield, L.Q.

Inevitable once the members of the lynch mob realise the mistake they made they know that if they are to avoid hanging they must either run or kill Marshal Cooper.While 'Hang 'Em High' isn't one of Clint Eastwood's best known westerns it is still well worth watching; especially if you are a fan of Eastwood or westerns in general. Revenge is a common theme in westerns but here it is portrayed in a slightly different way as Eastwood tries to bring his attackers to court. We also see just how unpleasant judicial executions were as the townsfolk all turn out to watch the convicts die. Another surprise is the ending; the story finish before all the loose ends are tied up; most notably that involving a woman who insists on seeing every prisoner in the hope of finding the men who killed her husband and raped her. The acting is solid; Eastwood is as good as always as Marshal Cooper, Pat Hingle is good as Judge Fenton and Inger Stevens is charming as love interest and wronged woman Rachel Warren.

Post did not have the skills and fantasy of the Italian master, and this lack of quality from Post is obvious.It's possible Post bet all his money on Eastwood alone in this production, but so much went wrong; the backdrop, the actors behind Eastwood, and the tedious use of camera. So to compare this film with the work of Sergio Leone is impossible. The impact of the supporting actors is rather thin, although actor Pat Hingle is solid as the hard judge.

For my troubles, I got a solid if not stolid pulp western, a tale of vengeance, with Eastwood as the avenging angel. The main revenge angle gets sidetracked with Eastwood's Marshal Cooper mission to bring in three rustlers and to a lesser degree, Inger Stevens' character shared wish to find the men who killed her husband and raped her years before. It's all stitched together in a patchwork kind of way by veteran TV director Ted Shaw and it probably shows, as aside from adopting a few Leone-type close-ups, much of the direction is of TV movie standard. There's some absolutely terrible soundtrack music, far too loud and far too frequently employed for my taste. As far as the acting is concerned, Clint plays Eastwood very well indeed, Stevens, tragically dead within two years of this, is winsome as the brooding widow. Pat Hingle and Ed Begley at least demonstrate some range in their work and of course Bruce Dern yet again gets to play another baddie before he comes to a sticky end. I wasn't convinced by the ending either, as if the film ran out of budget before the end. On the whole then a conventional two-dimensional made interesting to be watched by veteran actors Ed Bedgley and Pat Hingle.

Maybe not the perfect first choice (and I would probably rate it a lesser western in his filmography), but 'Hang 'Em High' saw Eastwood return to Hollywood after spending some time in the Italian wilderness (and a successful stint bringing us the 'Dollar' Trilogy' with director Sergio Leone). You could see it as kick-start for Eastwood in the American market.'Hang 'Em High' would be directed by Ted Post (who would go on to helm the first 'Dirty Harry' sequel 'Magnum Force' five years later) and had a very interesting cast too boot. Eastwood's steely glare and no-bull attitude fit snugly. Pat Hingle's heavy screen presence commands your attention with his speeches about justice and his mind-set of actually being the tool of the law, while on the other side of the coin Ed Begley provides a burly performance as the Captain of the hanging party who don't see job through and become the targets of a vengeful Eastwood. Ben Johnson doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, but gets an effective sequence which involves a cameo from Dennis Hopper. Bruce Dern also pops up (what's an American western without him) as a weaseling cattle hustler/murderer. L.Q. Jones and Alan Hale Jr. are good in their roles as part of the hanging party members. Rounding off the cast is the stunningly talented Inger Stevens as a hardy woman seeking her own personal justice.Eastwood, Stevens and Hingle's multifaceted characters had a perfect balance of exploring morality themes of vengeance, justice and pride. None of these characters were perfect in their ideals of what was right&#x85; hiding behind a badge, the law or seeking comfort, only separated them from a lynching mob (which the opening set-up to the film is fantastically staged). The conflicting views between Eastwood and Hingle were always gripping, and would hold its dramatic narration together. What was kind of disturbing was how the justice system made it a public spectacle&#x85; the crowd wanted justice and a hanging is what they were given. It's about power, never stepping down and showing a weakness. Despite the material penned by Leonard Freeman and Mel Goldberg throws around all of these heavy-handed ideas, never does it truly pick a side. It's a simple story (even with a few different sub-plots that sidetrack the personal vengeance, due to the commit of holding the law), but they do tie-up together with their issues. It has a little more going for it. However my favourite scene in the film (other than the strong opening and the final hanging show with an emphasis on the dangling legs) was when the camera focuses on Eastwood's face when he questions for the first time (and their first real exchange) Stevens' interest in the newly added prisoners. The tones, the expressions and the camera placement felt perfect in a sedate, but powerful moment.Post's mechanically leaden direction is done in a rough 'n tumble style getting amongst the dirt and grit, letting the everything go in a steady pace and relishing in the harsh violence. But I thought he kind of lost his way when Stevens' character came into the story. The interactions between Eastwood and Stevens' characters come like an afterthought in the final third where it becomes uneven, distracting and the pacing really does halt. Even when it comes to the ending, it's still pretty much unresolved.Dominic Frontiere's piercingly dynamite and illustrative score punishes the senses from all sides with a real starch spaghetti flavour.A solid offering.When you hang a man, you better look at him.

However, when he is offered a position as a Marshal by the judge who deals with capital punishment in the territory (Pat Hingle), Jed instead finds himself caught up between his own lust for revenge, his hankering to see people get a fair trail and the brutal, haphazard way the judge seems to hand out justice.Eastwood is on good form as always but the role is not one of his best. Jed Cooper is not a name that will be remembered as fondly as Will Munny, Josey Wales or 'The Man With No Name' when people discuss his Westerns. This is Pat Hingle's show all the way, his portrayal of a man constantly justifying to himself why he must do the things he does in order to try and maintain a semblance of peace is the cornerstone of the picture. Bruce Dern shows up in a small but memorable role as a villain and Dennis Hopper gives a typically unrestrained performance in his only scene.The script offering up the pros and cons of capital punishment for discussion is the highlight of an otherwise averagely executed Western actioner. Ted Post, who in later years would direct the second (and second best) entries in both the Dirty Harry and Planet of the Apes series', was a director who spent most of his time making TV shows. Clint bought him on to the project having worked with him on Rawhide and while their familiarity and bond may have help run a smooth set it did nothing for the artistry or excitement of the film. The studio's first pick, Sergio Leone, was unavailable at the time due to making on Once Upon A Time In The West and my opinion is that he would have done far better with the material.A light recommendation to Western and Eastwood fans only.

Following the 1958 Western Ambush at Cimarron Pass, Eastwood appeared on the CBS TV show Rawhide from '59 to '65, playing the part of cowhand Rowdy Yates, and then, of course, went to Europe to portray The Man With No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy. Teaming up with his old pal Ted Post (who had directed him in 27 Rawhide episodes), Eastwood returned with a film that was very much in the spaghetti Western vein, although done with a lot less flamboyant style. I suppose one might call it an American spaghetti Western; a Ronzoni Western?In the film, Clint stars as ex-lawman Jedediah Cooper, who, in the Oklahoma Territory of 1889, makes the mistake of his life when he purchases a herd of cattle from a man who has just killed the legitimate seller. Quickly apprehended by a lynch mob of nine angry men, Cooper is summarily strung up and left hanging. Fortunately, one of only 19 marshals in the Territory happens by and manages to cut Cooper down, right before the expiration point. The marshal (played by real-life ex-cowboy and rodeo champ Ben Johnson) plops Cooper into his tumbleweed wagon, along with a gaggle of other prisoners, for ultimate trial before the district's hanging judge, Adam Fenton (superbly played, as usual, by Pat Hingle, who has been a favorite of mine ever since I saw his stunning work in 1961's Splendor in the Grass). Cooper is quickly exonerated and offered a job as deputy marshal, giving him the power, thus, to hunt down the nonet of lynchers with relative impunity....Though the film is an uncertain melding of spaghetti and traditional American Western styles and tropes, it yet remains a highly entertaining and successful one. The picture looks great, for one thing, with spectacular New Mexico backdrops, and the film's producer, Leonard Freeman, has also cowritten a very winning and intelligent screenplay. This is perhaps the first Eastwood film in which his lead character has trouble toeing the line in regard to his superior's wishes, a problem best exemplified in the Dirty Harry films of the following decades. Though essentially a revenge Western, the film yet has not-so-subtle messages that it would like to impart relating to mob violence and civil justice. It is well paced and consistently exciting, populated by an assortment of well-drawn characters and featuring a truly stellar cast.As regards to that stellar cast, besides the three great actors already mentioned, Hang 'Em High showcases performances by the Swedish actress Inger Stevens (two years before her tragic sleeping-pill suicide, at age 36) as Clint's love interest; Ed Begley (two years before HIS death from a heart attack) as the wrongheaded leader of the lynching party; film noir mainstay Charles McGraw as the Red Creek sheriff; Bruce Dern as one of the more demented lynchers (Dern also appeared in another wonderful Western in 1968, Will Penny, as did Ben Johnson); Bob Steele (B Western star of the 1920s and '30s, and here playing one of Cooper's fellow prisoners); Alan Hale, Jr., as still another member of the lynching party (Hale had ended his run as the Skipper on Gilligan's Island immediately before this film started shooting in June '67); and, last but never least, Dennis Hopper (as a plumb loco preacher; I didn't even recognize Hopper, under his heavy beard, the first time I watched this film). In smaller roles, Mark Lenard (known to most Star Trek fans as Spock's father, Sarek), character actor L.Q. Jones and Arlene Golonka are all given their moments to shine. And I would be remiss if I did not mention the fine contribution here from Dominic Frontiere, the composer who is perhaps best known for his work on television's Outer Limits; from his dramatic and booming music during the film's opening credits, to the ersatz spaghetti theme that accompanies Cooper's initial appearance as the deputy marshal, to the lovely melody that accompanies Clint and Inger's love scene, his work here is highly impressive, as always. The bottom line is that Hang 'Em High is a terrific modern Western; no wonder it performed so well at the box office and filled so many theater seats back when (the film was the 20th highest grosser of that year). Although, as some wags would tell you today, the Eastwood of 44 years later might have a hard time telling an empty seat from an occupied one!

It's an intriguing, compelling piece of work making good use of the classic theme of revenge. Eastwood is peaceable Jed Cooper, a man wrongly hanged for cattle theft by a presumptuous lynch mob who believed him a thief. Fortunately, his life is saved by a kindly marshal (Ben Johnson) and a powerful judge (Pat Hingle) soon recruits *him* as a marshal, assigning him to bring in the men who hanged him - alive. Of course, whether they're brought back dead or alive doesn't make much difference to Cooper, although he comes to realize that they're not all bad, and his acquaintance of young Rachel (beautiful Inger Stevens) also helps to soften him somewhat. Eastwood selected capable journeyman director Ted Post to take the reigns, Post having worked with Eastwood and some of this movies' actors on various episodes of 'Rawhide'. They make this fine entertainment, with a deliberate pace and impeccable recreation of the period. It's amazing to see the manner in which executions actually were carried out back then, with vendors hawking drinks and children in attendance, and that's just one of the details of the story, which fortunately never wanders considering this does run close to two hours long. Dominic Frontieres' music is quite thunderous, and the gorgeous cinematography is credited to two men, Richard H. Kline and Leonard J. South. The characters are refreshingly multi-dimensional; with the exception of a few creeps (like the evil twerp played by Bruce Dern), the antagonists are not purely villainous, but doing what they thought was right. The cast is simply superb, with Ed Begley thoroughly impressive as the leader of the lynch mob. There are lots of familiar faces in the supporting cast; in addition to Dern, there's Dennis Hopper (too briefly seen, and not too recognizable), Alan The Skipper Hale, Jr., Charles McGraw, James Westerfield, L.Q. Jones, Joseph Sirola, James MacArthur, Bob Steele, Bert Freed, Joel Fluellen, and Jack Ging. Everybody involved makes this a very acceptable diversion, albeit one with some serious themes such as the manner in which the law is carried out, and how sometimes good (or at least not too bad) people can be victimized by it. Western fans should find this well worth watching. Eight out of 10.

Perhaps done by somebody like Sergio Leone. Well, it's very obvious that Hang 'Em High was inspired by those kind of movies and its understandable, since Eastwood had only finished making his famous Italian trilogy only two years ago and they were just now getting released in the United States. However, the film is entirely American-made.The actual movie itself, it's not perfect, it's not even what I would call a solid Clint Eastwood Western like High Plains Drifter or The Outlaw Josey Wales. It's flawed on a few regards, such as the love story of the film, and weak at some points especially in the climax, which I was really disappointed with. But overall, it's a good film and is definitely watchable. You'll find yourself watching it a few times without ever having anything bad to say about it. Performances by Clint Eastwood, Ed Begley, Pat Hingle, Ben Johnson, and the rest of the cast was average for the 60s. And that's most certainly not a bad thing at all. One thing I also like about Hang 'Em High is the fact that the bad guys aren't really bad guys in some regards. They're more of what I would classify as anti-heroes who take a few wrong, villainous turns.Hang 'Em High is a fairly decent 1960s Western film. It's not Eastwood's best film, but it's maybe one that is a bit underrated and maybe too unique for some people. For me, I just had a few problems with plot points and the climax.

Clint establishes himself as a great American actor with an American audience in this movie. He plays as a former lawman who is hanged by a bunch of lazy vigilantes who don't want to do their homework and find out if he is indeed innocent or not. They made one bad mistake. They left him for dead when he was saved by the local sheriff. Now, he is acquitted by a hanging judge who sends him out to find the men who hanged him and bring them to him for trial. (Seems kind of silly that he didn't want Jed to kill them when you know damned well that by the time this judge gets through with them, they're going to be swinging from the end of a rope.) Very insightful look into the hanging culture. People back in those days went to a hanging like they were going to a picnic, bringing snacks, singing hymns, selling goods, etc. While I'm all for people being punished for heinous crimes, I don't think it's very appropriate that it's turned into the circus it was back then. In spite of this movie's incessant preaching against capital punishment, it was still a good story, and everyone in this film got their just desserts.The ending puzzles me a bit, though. Jed and the judge make speeches about their viewpoints on hanging, Jed walks off, and the end credits roll. Was there some footage cut out of this ending? Seems to have ended too abruptly. Otherwise, good. Great music by Dominic OUTER LIMITS Frontiere. 7 out of 10 due to the abrupt ending and the incessant preaching.

The fact that Eastwood is not an actor doesn't take away from a brilliant script, which is what makes a great movie. Eastwood does his usual one emotion which makes him look like he's on drugs, but the story is flawless. The movie begins, of course, with Eastwood being mistakenly lynched by nine men, whose faces he tries to remember. When he is rescued, his history as a law enforcer puts him in good standing with a hanging judge to dispense law to a vast area, which includes bringing the lynch mob to justice. Along the way, Eastwood's character finds the brutal truth in extreme justice, and the savagery of Western justice is not far from the lynching he received. This is all done with a brilliant script, and good directing. Eastwood's character doesn't need to act, as the camera focuses more on the better actors and lets the audience be the good guy watching. A cast of all stars that even includes the Skipper from Gilligan's Island, Bruce Dern, Ed Begley, Ben Johnson, and Pat Hingle in a memorable performance as the character based on real life hanging Judge Parker.

"},{"Title":"Spaghetti Over Easy","Date":"8 August 2004","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Western","Review":" Clint Eastwood's first U.S. star vehicle, following fast on the heels of his triple-hit Dollars trilogy with Sergio Leone, shows that if Hollywood wasn't the most original place in the world, they could learn and adapt from outside success.There's many echoes of the Dollars films, with the music suggesting Ennio Morricone's classic work on The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly and a hard-bitten script which puts Eastwood's Jed Cooper on both sides of the law in a world that is far from black-and-white. Plenty of people get shot, and the brutality is extended by watching others get hung, including, in the opening sequence, Cooper. Pretty nasty stuff, in tune with what the Italians were doing with Westerns at the time.But there's a counterbalancing Hollywoodization in force here. Eastwood is not as casually brutal as he was in the Dollars films, he takes a lover, and he seems more amiable to folks, not just spitting tobacco grains at their feet. In the beginning, we even see him rescue a calf with a paternal grin.All this would suggest a watered-down, compromised product, except the film works on its own, somewhat lighter but by no means fey terms. Director Ted Post is no Leone. He lacks the sense of composition, the odd askew shot held forever and ever, the natural way of building unnatural suspense. But he does offer viewers something unique, a very strong sense of character, not just Eastwood but Pat Hingle's Judge Fenton, as complicated a character as you ever saw in a Western, not unmerciful or inhuman but somewhat blind and stubbornly so, as he believes justice must be, in pursuit of a greater good.Hingle's easily the best thing in the movie, but there's a huge swath of interesting minor characters, too, like Ben Johnson as a marshal who saves Eastwood but then a little while later guns down a wounded harmless insane man pretty much in cold blood. Michael O'Sullivan, in one of only two film roles he ever did, masterfully plays a prisoner who orates about the perils of alcohol, alternately hilarious and heartbreaking, before being strung up. Even the gang of villains who do in Eastwood early on, and have to sweat out his prospective vengeance thereafter, are given personalities and motivations which make them seem very human, even sympathetic.All this feeds the underlying question of the movie, an unusually complex one for its genre, which is When is one justified to kill a man, or not, whether one is an individual wronged or a government trying to establish order? The question is brought to a head during the film's centerpiece, a mass hanging sequence where O'Sullivan makes his big speech. In addition to displaying a colorful range of characters, both before the noose and looking on, we get a moment of real sadness when two boys, clearly undeserving of their fate, quiver through the preliminaries, the older one not even able to look at the other because, I think, he doesn't want to see his brother going through what he is going through.It's the major dividing line between the judge, who makes a rational if cold-blooded case for killing the boys, and Jed Cooper, who felt the two boys should have been spared. In time, Cooper will find the ability to forgive one of his initial attackers, in a short but effective sequence that feels more like a victory than any shooting. Of course, he deals with most of his attackers much differently, which makes the movie fun.Hang 'Em High does move slowly in parts; one senses more than a little lopping went on, at the cost of some continuity, to bring this in at two hours; and the romance with the character Inger Stevens plays feels tacked on, though she does provide some perspective for Cooper and the audience on just how distending the quest for vengeance can be. Maybe any system that prizes vengeance as a vehicle for justice is inherently flawed. Or maybe the Oklahoma territory just needed a better appeals system for convicted criminals than a plug of tobacco at hanging time.Whatever side of the divide you come down on, Hang 'Em High does a good job of presenting the question, and puts it in the background of a pretty decent gunslinger flick. Eastwood made better films in Hollywood, but he was off to a fine start.

This United Artists release served as the first Eastwood epic after Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Composer Dominic Frontiere's powerful orchestral score ranks as the best asset and enhances the predictable Leonard Freeman & Mel Goldberg screenplay about western justice. Frontiere composed the scores for The Invaders and The Rat Patrol. His score to the Lee Van Cleef western Barquero sounds like variations on his Hang'em High theme. Mind you, Eastwood looks cool as a glacier in his dark blue outfit and flat-brimmed hat, and he kills bad guys. Nevertheless, Hang'em High resembles a tautly made television drama. The surroundings, even the sandy desert scenes, lack the majestic sprawl of his Italian westerns and his later sagebrushers such as The Outlaw Josey Wales, The Pale Rider, and Unforgiven. Clearly, since he hadn't made a strong enough impression on Hollywood, Eastwood had to play it safe with a low-budget and actors more accustomed to appearing in TV westerns.No, Hang'em High was NOT a Spaghetti western. Lensed in Southern California, this thoroughly routine oater springs its one and only surprise when our hero gets his neck stretched in the first scene. The film resembles Hitchcock's Psycho in this respect. Jed Cooper is a former-lawman-turned-cattleman wrongly hanged for rustling who survives the ordeal. Hang'em High focuses primarily on the theme of revenge that figured prominently in most Italian westerns. The lynch mob found our hero after he had bought cattle from a murdered rancher. No matter what Jed says, Captain Wilson and his nine conspirators refuse to believe him. It later turns out that the man who killed the rancher gave Jed (Clint Eastwood) a forged bill of sale. This is what prompts the villains to see Jed swing. Cooper finds himself briefly imprisoned after a tough-as-nails lawman, Marshal David Bliss (Ben Johnson of Chism) cuts him down and takes him back stand trial at Fort Grant before the stern Judge Adam Fenton.Judge Fenton (Pat Hingle of The Gauntlet)is a quasi-Judge Roy Bean. He has the last word on justice, and Hingle delivers a commanding performance. The villains led by Captain Wilson (an elderly Ed Begley of Boots Malone) are an ineffectual lot. They botch hanging Jed Cooper, and he comes after them with warrants issued by Fenton. As much as Fenton warns Cooper that he better bring the hanging party in, Cooper winds up killing several of them. The town where all the action occurs has another character, Rachel Warren (Inger Stevens of Five Card Stud), who has Fenton's permission to look at all new prisoners. She is searching for the fiends that wronged her. The romance between Jed and Rachel is as contrived as most of this weak western. Meanwhile, Jed realizes that Fenton may be a bigger bastard than he is with his iron-fisted rules about legality. In his spaghetti westerns, Clint Eastwood bowed to nobody, but his lawman character here takes orders, something that clashes against the Eastwood characters in Two Mules for Sister Sara and Joe Kidd. One of the casting decisions defies logic, specifically Alan Hale Jr. as one of Wilson's riders who hangs Cooper. The portly Hale had played the beloved Skipper from Gilligan's Island, but he had played less lovable roles before Hang'em High. Nonetheless, it is jarring to see Hale in such a role One of the best casting decisions was veteran B-movie cowboy star Bob Steele. Meanwhile, Bruce Dern makes an excellent villain. Hawaii 5-0 actor James MacArthur has a memorable cameo as the gallows Preacher. Dennis Hooper and a line-up of familiar faces, including L.Q. Jones of Battle Cry and Ned Romero of Dan August flesh out Hang'em High. Not surprisingly, Hooper plays crazy prisoner called 'The Prophet.' There are no spectacular looking shoot-outs because Ted Post shoots everything likeone of his Gunsmoke or Rawhide episodes. The scene where Jed is riddled with bullets and Rachel has to take care of him adds a tearjerker text to the story. Happily, Eastwood would go on to make Two Mules for Sister Sara and redeem himself for this lackluster effort. The neatest touch occurs when they hang a number of men and one of them loses a boot as they plunge through the trap doors. Happily, Post's next outing with Eastwood would come with the highly superior Dirty Harry sequel Magnum Force. If you're looking for a better lynch law western, watch The Ox-Bow Incident with Henry Fonda.

It starts off as a decent concept, a lynched man trying to bring his lynchers to justice, but then it gets tied up in the story about a hanging judge that in my opinion cripples the concept rather than reinforcing it. There's every indication that the writer was merely padding the script to make it feature-length.The movie also suffers from poor music direction. There are loud climax dubs over events that don't have the slightest importance to the story. If that weren't bad enough, one of the recurring themes is a barely recognizable variation on the Gilligan's Island theme. What were they thinking? Was it an in-joke referring to Alan Hale's part in the film? It added an extra level of silliness to an already boring film (even though Hale acted well enough that I didn't recognize him).Between these two weaknesses, Hang 'em High comes off as Mystery Science Theater material. Eastwood fans can steer clear.

The movie has a choppy feel to it, and looks dated. However, Bruce Durn has a great cammio playing a crazy cattle rustler. Eastwood has another strong performance, and the story underplays a 1960's anti death penalty message.  Like the hanging judge form this film I have a verdict.  6 out of 10.

Eastwoods own talents had grown and there are some real actors in this film. The story is that of an innocent man (Eastwood) hanged by a vigilante group. He is rescued and found to be innocent. He then goes to work for the territorial Sheriff and Judge. He is supposed to bring his suspects in alive, but somehow, not too many of them manage to survive their encounter with him. Along the way, he manages to win the love of beautiful Inger Stevens. Eventually, he goes after the men who hanged him. The film is quite predictable, yet entertaining anyway.

But about halfway through, things begin to wander. The romantic subplot feels token-ish and unreal, as if it was only there to fit some requirement from the studio.More disappointing was Jed's role. Compared to the Leone films, Clint is way too soft and malleable, yet without any real charm either. By the end of the film, it is hard to figure out his motives at all, and the movie concludes feeling rather unfinished.The final confrontation scene in the film was not very suspenseful, and did not provide the kind of catharsis that is required in a good vengeance film.There are some good scenes, and the judge character is interesting, but other than that, this just doesn't have a lot to recommend.

Then Sergio Leone with his protagonist Clint Eastwood completely renewed the genre. The success of the three Dollar westerns demanded an answer from American directors. Hang 'em high is the first attempt - and not a convincing one. The cause is, that director Ted Post modifies most typical Leone elements. For instance Hang 'em high is sometimes raw, but not nearly as raw as the spaghetti westerns and certainly misses its cynical jokes. Still Hang 'em high contains some interesting elements. The opening scene is very memorable and the events after it follow logically from it. But slowly the movie loses track, introduces too many new elements and as a result jumps in all directions without getting anywhere. As a result no single theme of the three is fully developed. There is the revenge vs justice theme. When Jed Cooper finally has caught one member of the lynch gang, he does not show the least desire to torture him a bit. That is not trustworthy. The love vs revenge theme is only hinted at. I have seen the movie twice, but still don't remember the content of the female roles. That is a very bad sign; the female roles probably are very uninteresting. Finally there is the pardon vs justice theme. The two boys, who have saved Jed Cooper's life, are still hanged. Jed Cooper's protest is short and rather lame. As a result Jed Coopers character looks rather compliant; he rather easily adapts his moral code. At the end of the movie, when he rides to hunt the last member(s) of the lynch gang, Jed Cooper has transformed to the typical pillar of the primitive judicial system at the American frontier. Hang 'em high is one of Ted posts first movies. Previously he had done several episodes of the Rawhide series. I strongly suspect, that Ted Post was not able to keep control of flicks longer than an hour. Hang 'em high shows it; though entertaining it misses too many chances.

I had heard it was good, but i was left hugely unsatisfied. The film is unbelievably slow moving; in fact, occasionally it is like watching paint dry, and the script is incredibly weak and at times meaningless. If you want a decent clint western, try just about anything else, as this is the only western film of his i haven't enjoyed.

Unimpressed by Cooper's explanations he is found guilty & hung from the nearest tree & left to choke to death, miraculously Marshall Dave Bliss (Ben Johnson) just happened to be riding past & manages to save Cooper before he hangs. Taken back to the nearest town to stand trial proper Cooper is quickly found innocent, cleared of all charges & let go. Bitter & seeking revenge Cooper decides to become a Marshall & use the full weight of the law to track down those nine men responsible for his hanging & see them brought to justice...Directed by Ted Post this was one of Clint Eastwood's very first leading roles in an American film which was co-produced by his own Malpaso company & one has to say that I was very disappointed by this preachy unfocused Western that felt more like a drama at times rather than a tough gritty Western Eastwood would become synonymous with. To be fair to it Hang 'Em High starts off promisingly with Eastwood's character being brutally hanged for a crime he didn't commit & I was sat there thinking that Eastwood would now saddle up, don his stetson, load up his six shooters & dish out some justice of his own but against both expectation & hope Hang 'Em High quickly turns into some sort of anti death penalty drama as it takes great pains to point out that whether it's a lynch mob in the desert or an officially sanctioned hangman the death penalty is wrong & it even goes as far as to have Eastwood find redemption & forgiveness in his heart & actually bargains his own life to let one of his hangers go free! What? I was really hoping to see some sort of revenge Western that the opening pre-credits scene sets up so well but the constant drama & subplots that drift in various directions just didn't do anything for me & the film even tries to show a few of the lynch mob & villains in a sympathetic light which just felt wrong. At nearly two hours the film felt longer, the pace is slow & the lack of action or any real interest kills the film dead as far as I am concerned & there's no climatic shoot-out or showdown between Eastwood & the lynch mob which also felt like a let down.After such a great opening the film didn't really go in the brutal revenge action adventure direction that I wanted, of course this is just my opinion as I am sure there will be many out there who will enjoy the pacifist & moralistic tone of Hang 'Em High but I'm not sure we need an anti death penalty Western. I mean the law is all we have to separate us from the animals right? It's not perfect but I think most people would agree in certain cases the death penalty is justified, I'm not being funny here but todays cattle rustlers are tomorrows hardened criminals so the death penalty as a deterrent can't be ignored either, can it? The film has nice circa 1890's period production design as one would expect although the lack of any real action or any real Western edge doesn't do it any favours. I just thought after the terrific opening it was all downhill.Shot on location in New Mexico the film looks nice enough for sure, the shots are long & steady & very colourful which is nice to see & I much prefer the 'as is' look to the shaky hand-held camcorder with all the colour bleached out of the image cinematography of many recent films. The cast is fine, Eastwood is great as a cowboy although he doesn't really get to do much while veteran actors Pat Hingle, Bruce Dern & Dennis Hooper all appear.Hang 'Em High wasn't what I expected & maybe that was part of the reason I didn't like it, or then again maybe I didn't like it because of the lack of action & a preachy drama driven plot that seems to want to take a stance against the death penalty & not much else.

But 2 stars out of 10 is about all the respect it deserves. The only character that is that memorable is Clint Eastwood, and even he has no personality. I hated the story. Some guys hang a man without any proof that he actually did anything wrong, and then they don't even do it properly? What the heck is that? The cinematic elements of it are anything but desirable. The worst part of the film was the music, which was unbearable. Do not see this movie. It's a waste of time. Go see films that are really worth it, like the Pixar films. At least they're fun, unlike Hang 'Em High. "}]
