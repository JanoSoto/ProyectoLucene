[{"Title":"Got Much More Than I Bargained For","Date":"24 November 2004","Score":"43 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" To someone picking up this little flick without bothering to go into it a bit more, you are probably expecting some Disney-like movie (Just look at the box cover) and the premise even suggest it A man is reincarnated as a dog and goes on a search to find his family. Boy, was I surprised. Not only is the dog trying to find his family, he's out for revenge against the man who put him in the situation in the first place. Full of mature themes and gripping moments, this is one of those rare movies that will definitely make you think and- as stated by everyone else here- shed a few tears.We follow Fluke from puppyhood to adulthood as he starts trying desperately to find out who he once was. After putting 2 and 2 together, Fluke does indeed set out on a journey to find his wife and son, much to the dismay of his ill-fated friend Rumbo, a dog who was also human. When Fluke finds them, he's living the good life- that is, until his crooked business partner comes in and crashes the party. Fluke is determined to make sure he won't do any harm to his family as he did to him. But is Fluke going by truth, or what he wants to believe?... The main thing about this movie that hit me at first was the music. The beautiful orchestra soundtrack accompanied this film perfectly. There were a few times I watched the credits simply to hear the music. And of course, what's good music without good filmography to go with it? This movie has that too. Some of the most bright, natural filming can be seen with the dog as he braves mountains and rivers on his long journey, or during the more peaceful moments as he plays with his family out in the sunshine. All in all, the filming and soundtrack itself is definitely a step up from a few of the more well-known animal movies, like Homeward Bound for instance.The story itself is very unpredictable, another thing I was not expecting from a movie such as this. Fluke's acts and visions will keep you watching to find out the real story behind his past. But while he's fending away his partner, he's trying to convince his family that he's more than just some old dog. Many of these scenes had me stop the movie just to pull myself together, such as when he did his fatherly duties of tucking his son in and laying on his side of the bed during the night. Acting in the movie ranges from good to alright. It's not the best acting in the world, but the humans weren't the ones I paid attention to and even then, the dogs still had the best lines and voicing, despite the fact that they talked only for a short while. The little boy had to be the most irritating of all though, especially in scenes when he was distressed in any way. I also feel the lab scene could have been executed a bit better. That scene seemed to pass by too quickly or just put in the middle of the movie with no purpose, but it did help explain a major event, so I can't complain.In conclusion Fluke is a timeless gem and a very impressive attempt at a family drama from such an unknown director. The filmography, score, and plot itself made this movie one of best animal-oriented movies of the last century. Only the acting from the humans and a few of the sometimes out-of-place scenes hurt the movie just a tad, but not enough to stop me from giving this underrated movie the recommendation it truly deserves.

(Powder is my favourite movie) Usually a lot of animal movies come out with crazy and over the top antics, but this one, this is different, it has quite a unique and interesting plot, not just the average animal movie plot about a 'kid and his dog'. Oh No, 'Fluke' is different, its a lot more special than that. I cannot say that there aren't mistakes, but still when you watch you can feel the magic of the movie and you don't really notice anything wrong with it. Anyway, this is a very weepy film; it is bound to make you cry, if you are either a sensitive adult or a child. This film made me cry about three times, but then again I am a very soppy person when is comes to weepy movies of any kind.   If your wandering if its worthy of your viewing then I'll tell you now, it is completely and utterly worthy of anyone's viewing. If you see it in a video store and you haven't rented it out before, then rent it out, watch it, it's a brilliant film. The animal actors are superb, and I just loved this film, real tearjerker. Well I'm going to stop repeating myself and let you decide on your opinion on it. See it's a top movie! Oh and one more thing, the message in this film is quite a common message that is portrayed in a lot of films but the way this film does it, is very unique and powerful.

If it exploited our ability to care for others and to respect life, so much the better. This is a movie for people of all ages. The animal wranglers did an outstanding job, ditto the actors.

Then when poor Fluke finally tracks down his old family,he comes to realise that they would be better off being left alone, and move on....

The film was amusing and pleasant to watch. Fluke goes a few steps further than this and is really excellent on all counts. This time it is a human who comes back as a dog and the story is slightly different. It is rare for a film to accumulate so many good points on so many aspects......... beautiful score, magnificent picture quality and sets, plently of humour, and excellent plot from beginning to end with not a dull moment, a surprise ending and above all a HUGE dose of emotion. I must confess to having watery eyes throughout most of the film and the scene close to the end where Fluke is on the tombstone scratching away with his paw at the snow to uncover the writing on the tombstone was just too much. Although there is humour to offset the sad side of the film, it is nevertheless very disturbing especially to those people who may have a tendency to believe in reincarnation. It is in no way a simple kiddies animal film along the lines of Beethoven or Babe, it is really much deeper than that. I'm just surprised that I never heard of the film when it actually came out in the cinema and have waited till the year 2004 to discover it. It's true as well when a dog looks at you questioningly with his/her head slightly tilted to one side, one does wonder what on earth is going through their mind ? This film may possibly be the answer to that question ..............

Despite some familiar kid-movie trappings (actually, when you first hear the two dogs talking to each other you may be disappointed that yet another movie has used that gimmick, but at least the other dog is voiced by Samuel Jackson), this film isn't very accessible to kids; it's very unusual, rather grim and pretty much of a downer.

It stars Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz, Nancy Travis, Ron Perlman, Bill Cobbs, Jon Polito and Samuel L. Jackson. Music is scored by Carlo Siliotto and cinematography by Raffaele Mertes.Workaholic Thomas Johnson is killed in an auto accident and is reincarnated as a dog. As he grows from pup to adult dog he starts to remembering things from his human life and sets about piecing together exactly who he was and what happened to him.It was a box office flop, a hard sell anyway with its cross genre themes, but MGM didn't know how to market it. Was it an animal adventure for the kids? A family drama message movie? Or a metaphysical bit of dalliance? Truth is is that it is all three, an engagingly thoughtful movie that is flavoured by fantastical whimsy whilst also beating a poetic heart. There's humour in here, too, especially when Fluke teams up with the wise and shaggy Rumbo (Jackson). But predominantly picture is about emotional beats, sitting in that void between genuine warmth and tragedy. It's unashamedly sentimental, but that's a good thing, and it's not just confined to the animal aspects of the story, this is still a very real human drama. The messages within are handled with care, there's no beating us over the head here.Director Carlei disappeared from Hollywood after the failure of Fluke, which is a shame since he crafts a great picture of strength. His dog POV camera work is smart in bringing us into Fluke's world, and many shots are gorgeously framed and filmed by director and photographer alike. It's also admirable in how he handles the excellent canine actors (Comet as Fluke is mightily impressive and expressive), it's no disgrace to the human actors to say the canines own the movie. There's some implausibilities, obviously, and one or two moments are too surreal for their own good; a laboratory break out sequence is cheer worthy but Carlei overdoes it, but this is still a lovely and interesting movie. Just like the great John Herbert's novel is for adults, so is the film. You can watch it with the kids for sure, so long as you have the fortitude to discuss with them the film's inner workings. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Coming back, as a Dog","Date":"7 October 2006","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" **SPOILERS** Losing control of his car computer executive Thomas Johnson, Matthew Modine, drives off the road hitting a tree killing himself. We don't exactly know what lead to Thomas' death but he was a the time of his accident involved in some kind of game of chicken with his partner, in the computer firm, and good friend Jeff Newman ,Eric Stoltz. Did Jeff purposely drive Thomas off the road?We then see a number of puppies nursing and one of them turns out to be Thomas now reborn as a dog who ends up being a homeless but lovable, aren't they all, street mutt. Avoiding dog catchers cars and people Thomas ends up being befriended and taken in by Bella, Collins Willcox Paxton, a sweet and homeless bag-lady who give the mutt a name Fluke. Since Bella considers him to be a fluke of nature with his above average intelligence in being able to play and win money,for Bella and himself,at Three Card Monty.With Bella later passing away Fluke ends up back on the streets as a homeless dog. It's then when he runs into fellow mutt Rumbo who somehow can communicate with him telepathically. The two mutts become no only lifelong friends but even, at the end of the movie, friends from one lifetime to another.Sweet touching and in some ways tragic movie that has Fluke trying to find his family when he was Thomas Johnson and save them from his partner in his computer firm Jeff whom he feels was not only responsible for his death but is now a threat to them. As Fluke begins to remember his past as Thomas Johnson he starts to act more human then canine trying to rejoin his widowed wife Carol, Nancy Travis, and young son Brian, Max Pomerance. Wise old Rumbo tells Fluke something that will later dawn on him when he tragically finds out the real truth about the past that the left behind; a past that Fluke in his own and unrealistic way tried to change.Rumbo who's later shot and killed saving Fluke from being experimented with by this mad scientist prof. Santini, Federico Pacifici, and his hulking henchman Sylvester, Ron Perlman, tells Fulke just before he died that he also knows who he was in a previous life, a young Navy man, but left that in the past where it belonged hoping. Fluke would not do the same thing with his fixation on Carol and Brian as well as Jeff but to no avail. It was up to Fluke to find out the truth and in the end almost end up dead by doing it to see just how right his friend Rumbo was.Not really as sad as you would expect it to be Fluke in the end realizes that his past life, and those he knew in it, should be left alone and that him trying to change things will only make things worse. Fluke also begins to see, what he was too blinded to see as Thomas Johnson, that he really wasn't the nice and understanding person that he thought that he was as Thomas. Coming back as the family pet to Carol and Brian made Fluke the odd dog out as his vicious and predatory nature took hold of him. Every time he encountered Jeff, a family friend, he would turn on him to the point where he almost killed Jeff. Sadly Fluke found out that his suspicions of Jeff being responsible for his death, and trying to take over his company by marrying Carol, were all wrong.

Even though it can conflict with the spiritual beliefs of some, it is by no means stupid. On the contrary, it is very moving, blue, heartwarming and tragic. A heavily misunderstood and underrated great little film that has aged with dignity and flopped because it's not for everyone. There are many powerful scenes and there is something magical about it. Other than the story, journey and gorgeous landscapes, the wonderful soundtrack accents this magic and emotional feeling. This soundtrack is just so beautiful! The soundtrack combined with the powerful scenes... worth to have a Kleenex nearby.The journey of Fluke the dog is so emotional and he is such a sweetheart that we almost don't even think that he was once a human being and how he was like then.By no means it is a perfect movie. It has some flaws (at least to me) but the global result is very good. The actors are generally good Max Pomeranc as the sweet boy Brian, Matthew Modine as Tom Johnson and as the voice of Fluke, Nancy Travis as Carol, Eric Stoltz as Jeff Newman, Collin Wilcox Paxton as Bella and, of course, the dogs Comet as Fluke, Barney as Rumbo and all the other animals. I don't like Samuel L. Jackson but he does a good job as Rumbo's voice.It's a shame that Max Pomeranc didn't feel like doing more movies after this. He had charisma and he could act for real. But it was his decision and I understand and respect that. I have to.I am surprised that there are two versions of this. I didn't know. I always knew the original version from 1995, so it's a surprise for me to find out that there is also a 1996 version in which some scenes were removed and the scene of Jeff's car accident was slightly modified. Changes are minor and it's the same movie anyway, but I prefer the 1995 version (for me, the true version). Title in Portugal 'Fluke'.

Depending on their karma, some are promoted to higher forms beyond our present experience and others are degraded to lower species. Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita When one dies in the mode of ignorance, he takes birth in the animal kingdom. Dramatizing this point of ancient doctrine, Fluke is about a man who is killed in an auto accident and returns as a dog to protect his wife and young son and to learn some important lessons. Based on a novel by James Herbert, a British writer known for his work in the horror genre, the film is directed by Carlo Carlei, an Italian director whose first feature, The Flight of the Innocents received considerable praise.In Fluke, Thomas Johnson (Matthew Modine) and Jeff Newman (Eric Stolz) are business partners who have had a falling out. After Newman takes off after an argument, Johnson chases after him in his car but is run off the highway by an oncoming truck and has a fatal accident. The film then moves to an urban alley where an older dog is nursing her newborn pups until she is hauled away by animal control officers and taken to the pound. Left to fend for himself, the small pup hooks up with Bella (Collin Wilcox Paxton), a homeless woman who names him Fluke because he is always able to figure out where the stone is in a shell game that brings in some money for the unlikely pair.Shot in cuts with both real and animatronic dogs, Fluke, now a fully-grown Golden Retriever, meets a street-wise St. Bernard named Rumbo who communicates telepathically with him in the voice of Samuel L. Jackson and teaches him the ways of the world. After some misadventures in an auto junkyard and an escape from a cosmetic research laboratory that experiments with animals, Fluke remembers the family he left behind when he was a man and manages to find his way back to his former wife Carol (Nancy Travis) and son Brian (Man Pomeranc) in the town of Hopewell. Realizing that when he was a man, he never had enough time to be with his son, Fluke makes up for his past failures and the scenes showing him playing with Brian are quite moving.Fluke decides that his mission is to protect his wife from Newman, his old business partner, whom he thinks is out to do her harm. While the animals' acting ability appear to be mystifying, in reality they were very well trained to respond to verbal and physical commands and were rewarded with food, never mistreated. Max Pomeranc, the adorable chess player from Searching for Bobby Fischer, turns in an outstanding performance as young Brian Johnson but unfortunately it is wasted in a film that was undone by dismal reviews from film critics, who called it morbid, bizarre, and a booby trap for fuzzy-animal lovers and kids, all the things that it is not.The same critics also thought the idea of reincarnation might be too deep for children and the film consequently bombed at the box office, an occurrence that many think caused Pomeranc to abandon a promising film career. While not overlooking its many clichéd moments, Fluke deserved a better fate. It is a heart warming story that may just encourage children to think about some things they will never hear about in church or in school.

Yes, this is an impossible and surreal story. So what? It's beautiful, sentimental, sad and depressing. Fluke isn't just a movie about man's best friend. It's one of the best of its kind. They don't make movies like this now. It's a touching, dramatic, deeply emotional, heartwarming and sweet movie. A magical touch has a role here too and it goes beyond the small number of special effects (which are effective).Very few movies are capable of making me teary eyed. This one, however, is powerful on that. There are many emotional scenes. I should bring a Kleenex with me whenever I watch this film.Despite the frequent use of simplicity, this movie can also count with the help of gorgeous sceneries sunsets, rivers, waterfalls, green places, mountains, snow and other things.The soundtrack is a revelation and a masterpiece. It fits in perfection soft, relaxing, emotional and beautiful piano melody. It's entirely instrumental, no vocals or singing.I've always loved this movie and I've always thought that Fluke is such a beautiful name. Plus, Comet is another beautiful name. Comet is the name of the brown Golden Retriever that portrays Fluke, while Barney is the name of the Saint Bernard-like dog that portrays Rumbo. Both of them terrific actors - especially the Retriever, very convincing and very expressive with his sad eyes and general acting. Golden Retrievers and Saint Bernards are among my favorite dog breeds. They're so beautiful and affectionate.As for the cast, we've got Nancy Travis as the pretty Carol in one of her best roles. We have Matthew Modine in a good performance as Tom, a workaholic. True, we don't see much of human Tom, but what we see is enough to realize that he was an emotionally distant workaholic. There is also Eric Stoltz (who was originally considered for the role of Marty McFly in Back to the Future), good as Jeff Newman. As the voice of Rumbo, we've got Samuel L. Jackson (not much of an actor, but his vocal performance is interesting). And finally, there is Max Pomeranc, who steals the show as Brian (the son of Tom and Carol). Max Pomeranc, besides being a cute and handsome boy, was also a brilliant actor. Too bad he didn't want to continue a career as an actor after this, his 2nd and last film.As for the characters, Rumbo is a cool quadruped chap. Fluke is so sweet and affectionate that we almost forget he was once Tom. Brian is such a loving and sweet kid, one of the nicest kids in the big screen. His love for Fluke is another close resemblance to the other doggy movies like this.As a final note and personal observation, it's sad that this movie did so poorly at the theaters and critically. It's one of those movies which were unfairly criticized... and is underrated either. One of the few things I don't like in this movie is the evil Sylvester character very sinister-looking with his demon-like face and also a vicious man. This should definitely be on Top 250.

It can include the animals too. When I first saw this movie in the television, well... this is the first time a family movie packed with the animals that could ever touch my heart... I felt so...touched. I don't even know what must I say to give this comment! Actually, most event that could touch my heart is the dog's love... I don't know the exact situation about that dog, because I didn't watch it from the first time beginning. It some kinds like their father's reincarnation, or the others..., I guess. But I'm sure, that in the deepest meaning of this film, there's a love, and a responsibility between the family, although their 'father' is the dog.Yeah, that's it! Love will never be matched or even equaled by the other thing in this world. There's always be a connection, between the father, mother, and the child / children. And I like the film which can tell me that all!!!!! Example, this film!!!!! But, so pity. I ever expected that the ending of the film can be more happy and so touching... But... well, y'know, it's a little bit of disappointing!!!!! But, it wouldn't matter. I recognize what kinds of effort that they've done to make this film seems more touchable..........

Here we have a movie that teaches us something about ourselves, life and love. It does not bombard us with visual effects, nor does it try to be anything but what it really is, a beautiful movie. From all of the actors,from the leads and even smaller parts, even the old bag lady, compliment this movie. Fluke works is so many ways, with a score that is matched with perfect photography. Special credit must go to the dog trainers and the director, it must have been such a joy to see this film coming together and completed into such a great and special movie. I fully intent to buy this on DVD, and to read the book. As an animal lover and a fan of all the adult leads, voice actors as well, this was a pleasure to watch and a movie that deserved to smash all box office records. Yet even if it did not, I am sure it will live on in the memories of all of the people who have seen it, for many years to come, and will get better with each viewing. Well done Fluke.

Sometime later, he is reincarnated as a puppy named Fluke. As he grows up, Fluke starts having flashbacks of his past life, and, believing his family is in danger from the man he holds responsible for his death, sets out to find them.Fluke isn't your typical doggie movie; this isn't Old Yeller or Homeward Bound. This is a touching story about mortality, and how love goes on after death. It raises important questions for both children and adults - is everything as it seems? What happens when and our loved ones die? Are they happy, what's in store?Yes, the film is at times cheesy, but it isn't wholly distracting and is forgivable. The training is amazing and the voice acting (Modine as Fluke/Johnson and Jackson as his friend, Rumbo), gives a depth and personality to the canine characters. There is beauty in Fluke's love for his wife and son, in the subtle relationship he shares upon his return in dog form. The music is wonderful. There is much depth to this film that one would not know upon picking up the box.I first saw Fluke at around ten years old; I was obsessed with dogs, and my mom told me that there was a film about a dog finding his family on TV one night. I fell in love with this movie instantly, and it's still a firm favourite to this day. It is nowhere near perfect, but it's fascinating and beautiful - this is quite possibly one of the most important, overlooked films of all time. This isn't just a kiddie dog film; this is a film about something deeper. Give this underrated gem a chance; it may touch you in ways other stories can't. This is a film for everyone - not just children.p.s. Parental Guidance advised - the themes are serious and dealt with extremely well. but there's no dumbing down. Please watch WITH your children.

Whether romping and wrestling with his brothers and sisters or curling up by his mother for a nap, Fluke is as contented as any young pooch can be. But when recurring dreams and a series of mishaps trigger memories of a very 'different' world, he slowly realizes that he once had a very different life - as a man! (and, that man would be Matthew Modine) Convinced of his previous identity, Fluke sets out on an extraordinary journey that leads him back to his human family&#x85; and shows him more through the eyes of a dog than he could ever see as a man, according to the DVD sleeve description.As far as pooch pictures can run, this one has some bite - thanks to great dog's eye direction from Carlo Carlei and gorgeous color photography by Raffaele Mertes. The premise - that dogs (and other animals) are reincarnated as people - is sweet, but the film's structure takes too many leaps. We begin by having Mr. Modine roll over and play dead, in an apparent two-lane country road conflict with sexy Eric Stoltz (as Jeff Newman). For a long time, you're left wondering what this was about&#x85; After romping around with velvety-voiced Samuel L. Jackson (as Rumbo), the story becomes Fluke's search for his human family - beautiful widow Nancy Travis (as Carol) and their cute son Max Pomeranc (as Brian Johnson). Then, Fluke's stated mission to somehow reveal his true identity. Now, they establish this really, REALLY smart dog can actually phone home - so, you could expect that he will eventually knock over a pot of alphabet soup and spell out, Doggone it, I'm Tom!In the end, Fluke's spotty memory accounts for some dangling plot threads, likely woven better in James Herbert's original novel.But, it's still a fun movie.******** Fluke (6/2/95) Carlo Carlei ~ Max Pomeranc, Nancy Travis, Eric Stoltz, Matthew Modine "},{"Title":"Retains some of the original novel's themes","Date":"4 January 2008","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" English horror scribe James Herbert's horror novels have proved difficult to adapt to the motion picture medium. The Survivor, a brilliant novel that was ripped off by Peter Weir's Fearless and a handful of other movies, was a rotten pile of smoking crap. George Cosmatos's Dark Eyes, based on Herbert's groundbreaking The Rats, was almost unwatchable and totally unconvincing. Shifting its events from London to Canada (standing in for a US city) was its first cardinal sin. At least Fluke retains some of the Herbert novel's heart; it is much lighter, but it eliminates one of the novel's greatest scenes (the dog meeting a frog). It takes the character of Fluke (a human reborn as a dog) and some thematic elements from the novel, but it doesn't adhere to much else. Still, it's a well told story (with some mushy interludes) about a reincarnated man (on four legs) who attempts to reconcile with his loved ones and, in the process, is forced to accept some harsh truths about himself. The confronting of these harsh truths is what gives Fluke its depth and originality. The animals communicate telepathically, so we hear human voices over images of dogs with mouths that don't move much; the concept takes some getting used to, and it didn't really work for me. The interchanges themselves were fine, but the voices felt disembodied (though not as disembodied as the voice-over in the dreadful Jonathan Livingston Seagull). The performances of Mathew Modine and Eric Stolz are solid, as are the canine star turns. This is one of the better Herbert adaptations in that it is a decently made movie, but it still doesn't capture Herbert's bleak world view.

The writers and producers apparently couldn't make up their minds. The cute Milo & Otis tone of early scenes yields to turgid, slow melodrama, a disturbing personality change in the dog, scenes of violence, and an extremely disappointing, sad ending. The photography, the music, all details including the acting -- specially by the dog or dogs in the title role -- were fine. I'll blame the writer. I regret having spent two hours of my life waiting for this movie, as shown on the Animal Planet cable channel, to reach its disappointing, sad ending. May I offer a suggestion? For a much more entertaining canine reincarnation tale, look for Oh, Heavenly Dog, in which private eye Chevy Chase comes back to Earth as Benji. O.K., it has some violence, too, but it's lots more fun, and the filmmakers aren't trying to sucker tears out of the audience. "},{"Title":"Hankies?

One of his few non-horror tales (and in many ways more of a fairy tale than anything else), it has the potential of a great movie.So what does Carlo Carlei do? He stuffs the film with slo-mo violin-choked scenes that clash completely with the moody and poignant promise of the opening scene (and Herbert's book as well) and leaves out the book's most hilarious scene with the cat and the old lady.This could have been on a par with Babe. As it is, I'll add points for Eric Stolz, the dog and camera work (which is truly outstanding) and subtract just as many for Nancy Travis, direction and music - Yeech! "}]
