I didn't really understand this film until I reached the end and then all the pieces fell into place. I had to see it twice to really grasp what the plot was all about. The story followed four different couples; married, engaged, dating and cheating. Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart literally bumped into each other and are about to venture out on a first date. Angelina Jolie is crazy for a guy she met at the club (Ryan Phillipe), Anthony Edwards and Madeline Stowe are cheating on their respective spouses. This makes for an interesting viewing and ending, which was a complete twist, and a pleasant shock. Playing By Heart has a lot of complex story lines that really works.This was a film of epic proportions and showed what it had to take to maintain relationships and what love really is and what it will do if people truly love their spouses. I was impressed with everyone's performance; however, I must point out the most outstanding one, which was by Angelina Jolie. Jolie has finally come out from her father's shadow and created one heck of a resume of films that includes Gia and The Bone Collector among others.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

It had a great cast and a great story and even the trailer for it was funny.  And plus, can't Sean Connery sell a movie all by himself?  This is a true hidden gem of a film and it is one that really should be seen by everyone.I won't really get into the details of the film too much because seeing what this film is all about is one of the joys of it.  You watch it and you know there is more to it than the screen play lets on about and it is fun trying to piece clues together to understand what is going on.  It is a mystery in some ways and isn't that what the movie claims to be?  A mystery about love. And as they allude to, love is a mytery anyway.My fave characters are Gillian Anderson's and Jon Stewarts.  Their story hits all the right notes and it is easy to relate to them.  They are both cautious people when delving into love.  Both have been hurt but one of them is just a little more relaxed and willing to learn about love again.  And there is one scene where Gillian jumps all over Stewart about some silly issue and this is the area where most movies go the traditional route and they break up, get back together and live happily ever after.  It is a typical concept and it has been done to death.  But in this movie it takes a fresh approach to solving problems and that is it's strength.This is a great romance and it is also wickedly funny.  And the way everything is summed up at the end is not only perfect but it is heart warming and it leaves you feeling glad to be in love, or at least willing to fall again.

Apart from a couple of films in the late 80s and a number of films for video with perfectly unappetising titles, Willard Carroll did not seem to be a promise living up to the great cast he assembled for this film.How wrong can you be! An excellent drama with real life issues is presented in a more live theatre style than the heart-tugging overplayed resources of more banal cinema productions. I mean, what bad luck that such a pretentious over-hyped `American Beauty' (qv) for instance, receives an avalanche of undeserved accolades, while this little gem just passes by, relatively unknown. In `Playing by Heart' you have a natural well played-out series of events without any of the overladen bombastics so frequent in American cinema. Excellent interpretations here &#150; among the best I have seen of Sean Connery, and Gena Rowlands is his perfect counterpart. Full marks for interpretation to Gillian Anderson, Jay Mohr, Dennis Quaid, Ellyn Burstyn just wonderful, as is Madeleine Stowe, and Ryan Phillipe; and it is the first film in which Angelina Jolie is not appearing only to show off her indisputable charms, as she is wont, but to play her first really convincing r√¥le without flashing unnecessarily her anatomy all over the place.So, evidently, full marks to Willard for piecing together all these elements to bring out what is indeed a very enjoyable surprise. Most certainly a film to see again. My only quibble is that perhaps the last ten minutes or so did not quite live up to expectations however I would not say that this factor spoils any of the impressions made during the rest of the film.My vote is a little higher than the IMDb User Rating.

This device has been employed by other directors, notably, Robert Altman. Whereas Mr. Altman interconnects his scenes differently, Mr. Carroll, keeps the stories separate, only to have them come together at the end.The director was exceptionally lucky in amassing this talented cast to appear in his film. Viewers of all ages will identify with the different stories since they resonate with different age groups. Most comments submitted to IMDb seem to be from young viewers who think the best thing in the movie are Joan and Keenan. While this couple do a good job, there are other good moments involving some of the other couples we see in the film.Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands make an excellent couple. Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe do also good work in the film. But Madeleine Stowe and Gillian Anderson have more interesting characters. Same could be said about Dennis Quaid, who makes a mark as Hugh, the tormented man who discovers his wife's infidelity. Anthony Edwards, Ellen Burstyn, Jay Mohr, and a surprising Jon Stewart are among the actors seen in minor roles.The film will delight audiences because the film catches one's imagination from the beginning.

An ensemble romance that should at least be notable for bringing together such a large and diverse cast, Playing By Heart is an enjoyable romantic tale of eleven people in Los Angeles whose lives are interconnected.Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands play the oldest couple. Dealing with old age, Gena discovers that Sean considered having an affair during their 40 years of marriage. Learning to deal with this 25 years later, Rowlands and Connery are very good as a couple going through changes late in life. Connery is as dashing as ever, and him and Rowlands seem they have been together for 40 years. Their story is convincing and refreshing.Keenan (Ryan Phillippe) and Joan (Angelina Jolie) are the youngest couple, two club kids looking for companionship in a complex world that Connery and Rowlands had never conceived of. Their story is as engaging and believable as that of Hannah and Paul. Jolie is the real star of this movie. No matter how composed she makes Joan out to be, we can always see her insecurities lurking just beneath the surface. Phillippe has little to do but bounce off of Jolie's tour-de-force, but he does it admirably and they make a sexy, believable young couple.John Stewart and Gillian Anderson are also very good. She is a lonely theater director and he is a lonely architect. They have a natural unforced chemistry that you wouldn't expect from these two very different television personalities. Although their relationship in the script seems ill-conceived, their performances almost make up for it.Madeline Stowe and Anthony Edwards are the most unappealing and ridiculous couple in the movie. As a couple cheating on their respective spouses, they have secret rendezvous in a hotel room almost every night from what it would seem. We never know the specifics of anything which is amusing at first, but becomes tired by the end of the film, as do the performances of Edwards and Stowe.Ellen Burstyn and Jay Mohr play a mother and son. Mark is dying of AIDS and his mother rushes to his bedside. Mark and become very close before he dies. Although Burstyn and Mohr are good their story gets little screen time and thus doesn't feel as important as it should be.Finally, Dennis Quaid is a man who spends his evenings in bars telling fantastical stories to anyone who will listen. Why does he do this? I can't give away the film, but the answer isn't truly satisfying, although Quaid gives a very good performance.The stories all manage to come together in the end in a way that's clever and satisfying. While not the best movie, Playing By Heart has its heart in the right places and manages to have some keen insights into love and relationships.GradeB+ "},{"Title":"The entire theater stayed put for about 4 minutes taking in all they had seen.

If you like love stories and involved dialogue then this is a flick for you.  It is a quadruple love story with a small dose of extra marital affair, a fair look at a husband's search for himself and a sprinkle of mother/son understanding.  Six stories to start and you must follow each of them.  All of these stories come together at the end in a way that really touches your heart.Beware of other comments regarding this movie in this area  - a couple of commenters have told the entire story.  Part of the joy of this movie is to try to figure out how all of these characters connect to each other.  I found it enjoyable to see I was right while I watched it all unravel. There's nothing wrong with predictability especially if you're not really *that* sure if you came to the right conclusions before the end.Angelina Jolie's acting is stunning and her repore with Ryan Phillipe is perfect.  I was surprized to see that Jon Stewart is a natural and Gillian Anderson can do no wrong in my eyes.  If nothing else, see it for Sean Connery who is always at his best.I think that people who don't like this movie don't enjoy the mystery of love.  Talking about love is like Dancing about Architechture.  How is this so hard to fathom?  The story is confusing because love is confusing. That's what this movie is trying to say.  But that's not gonna stop me from trying.  These lines are reiterated in the movie  They're said at the very beginning and then the same scene is shown in its proper order.  It doesn't take a genius to appreciate it. Some have expressed disinterest in a few of the characters, such as the affair between Madeline Stowe and Anthony Edwards.  It's called a family and once the movie is over, we see how they relate at the end.  For Stowe and Edwards, one of these hired the other for a job at a party at the end, and an affair ensued. Stowe's husband, Dennis Quaid, thinks she doesn't like him and does some role playing and soul searching because he's been told he doesn't have much of an imagination.  He's only trying to figure out where the two of them went wrong.  Some have also expressed concern over why the mother/son segments, played by Jay Mohr and Ellen Burstyn, were even needed. This would have only taken some extra attention to the story itself.  Hint to those who have not seen it  they were the next door neighbors to Hannah and Paul making Jay Mohr the 'boy next door.'All in all, all the actors do an incredible job and the story is something to see and LISTEN to.  Both times I saw it, the entire theatre stayed put for at least 4 minutes taking in all they had just seen.  That alone should intrigue you.  On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 9.

The characters were well developed, individual, and full of potential and humanity.  The relationships were actual and realistic, a wonderful break from the Fantasy of Sleepless in Seattle (or You've Got Mail, pick the title you want).  The presentation of people with problems and realistic responses to these problems and the people who are affected by these problems really makes this movie more than a past-time; it is a gift, showing us what we are and what we can become with some work and maybe a small paradigm shift.Everyone did a wonderful job of presenting real people, Sean Connery found a role which allowed him to be his age but not loose that which he is loved for sinful good looks and flawless composure. Gillian Anderson was so good that by the end I had almost stopped waiting for Molder to arrive. But for me Angelina Jolie was the centerpiece, as she showed the greatest degree of development and growth, epitomizing the struggle that each person was going through.To me, the plot was a lot more complicated than just the feelings that develop from watching the movie, and the depth of perception is honestly presented in the comments of the other reviewers; most seem to have watched the movie with so much intensity that they got up 35 minutes into it to go and tell the popcorn boy to give them a new bag because they had specifically asked for NO butter.  This movie is cognitive to the degree it is affective.  It takes one relationship and divides it up into several stages (seen as the family members' relationships), and in doing so it allows us to see relational development in ways we normally can't, just as we repeatedly see the time of day change against the buildings.It is funny, it is romantic, but it is true. And I am thankful for its gift of sight into life, into death.

In Trent (John Stewart) she meets her match, as he pursues her with honesty, affection and lots of humour.  Too good to be true?  Joan (Angeline Jolie) is a bar-hopper who can't seem to meet the right man, until she hooks up with Keenan (Ryan Phillippe).  His quiet introspection bruises as it bumps up against her more flamboyant and ebullient style.  But their respective vulnerabilities open up the possibility for a more permanent attachment.  Or do they?  Accused of having no imagination and neglecting his wife, Hugh (Dennis Quaid) is a man who every night reinvents himself by entering a different social establishment and telling lies to unsuspecting patrons.  To what end? Married, but not to each other, Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards) are having an affair in which each understands the limits of the relationship.  Or do they?  Hannah (Gena Rowlands) and Paul (Sean Connery) are facing the most serious threat to their forty years of marriage - his brain tumor.  Or is it?  And finally, Mark (Jay Mohr) is dying of AIDS while his mother Mildred (Ellen Burstyn) sits vigil at his bedside.  In their last moments together, each reconciles their relationship with the other as well as to their friends and family.  Those are the characters and this is another in a long line of love as a battlefield stories.  In this case, everyone walks away with scars, though some more deadly than others.

The problem is that the characters are stuck with this terrible script and film that takes itself too seriously. Gillian Anderson plays a woman burned in the past by love who is unwilling to try again, and proves repeatedly that she does not deserve someone as dedicated and earnest as Jon Stewart (who does redeem the humor a teeny tiny bit). That's one facet of the story down the drain. Then there's the emo-predecessor Ryan Phillipe who attracts the party girl Angelina Jolie, whose resulting relationship is unbelievable. Then there is Patricia Clarkson who has an affair with a man purely for their sexual compatibility, which is just stupid. Dennis Quiad is one of the more interesting character, showing up at bars with these outrageous stories and being followed by a woman, but as with many other aspects of this film, the buildup is much better than the actual conclusion and denouement (they really let you down). But the very worst are Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands, whose struggling marriage is hard to watch. My point is that after a certain point, the cheesy lines start making you wince with their pure predictability. You could be one of the characters and say the lines.

It's also got a British actor (Sean Connery) to boot, as well as some big stars like Angelina Jolie and surprisingly, Jon Stewart (being a lot more romantic here than on his Daily Show, of course). But Playing by Heart isn't that funny, which may be why it's escaped everyone's ears. It's undoubtedly a well-made film, but it just didn't leave me gushing with praise. The acting was good, and the tribulations and angst the characters felt were real and at times somber (especially the poor man dying of AIDS), but the film left no lasting impression on me. The humor was rare and the drama on the dry, oh well, too bad or (in monotone) wooo, problem solved, happiness for all side. But then, I'm a finicky watcher and I admit, a borderline pretentious critic. Since I didn't dislike the film, it probably means most people will enjoy or even love it, so I give this a 7/10. Just don't watch it expecting to burst into uproarious laughter or a free flowing sob-fest. You'll most likely chuckle here and there (like when discovering John Stewart's bed buddy) and feel sorry for those afflicted with disease, who, for me, are the only truly touching characters in this not-bad, not-contrived, not-unimpressive film.

Joan is glamorous, witty, loves acting, loves her cat and never stops talking. Mostly she talks about herself. At a club she spots Keenan, a boy with blue hair and hard eyes. One of the first things he tells her is he doesn't date. Sure thing Joan says But if you want, meet me at the cinema tomorrow. But it wont be a date if you don't want to. And what do you know he actually shows up! But Keenan is a boy with secrets. He won't tell Joan what has happened to him, so she assumes he's been ditched by the girl he loved. She's close to the truth, but she could by no means ever emagine what Keenan has gone thrue.**WARNING SPOILERS!!**My God! The scene where Keenan tells Joan the reason he hardly ever smiles and is persuaded he will never be alowed to love again is one of the strongest scenes in movie history! I cried a lot over this young couple's destiny. I cried because it was so unfair that they, so in love and so happy, were going to be punished for something someone else did. How unfair isn't the world when a young guy like Keenan is given HIV by his unfaithful girlfriend, and is therefor going to be ripped away from the girl he loves. Twice!

After watching it I wanted to watch again and again and soforth. I can't pick a favorite story because they were all well done and well defined, if I had to pick a least favorite I suppose it would have to be Madeline Stowe's, but that served to provide the one twist at the end of the film i'm sure no one saw coming.After watching this film one has to wonder a couple things. Why isn't Jon Stewart in more movies? Why doesn't Sean Connery do more smaller projects? and why doesn't Angelina Jolie stick to this kind of film? She's magnificent in it.The soundtrack is a very jazzy score (which I loved) and the songs used in the film were well placed. And while some found this film depressing, I found it to be much more satisfying and fulfilling than most so-called romantic comedies on the market today. This is a perfect date movie.I'm also glad that this film was released on an independant and hence small scale instead of being given the big hype campaign. I think playing this movie up on a grand scale would have taken away from how wonderful it ended up being. Every single critic in the world who goes to see all the Star Wars and all the Harry Potter's trying to analyze this film as if it was just another date movie out there would have done nothing but make less people want to see it.Also, on a final note. Where are all the girls out there comparable to Joan (Angelina Jolie), she's wonderful, erotic, sensual, witty, and well versed. Plus she likes going to see The Texas Chainsaw Massacure (late show only of course), do women like that exist?So on a final note. Playing By Heart is a wonderful, touching and damn near perfect independant film. See it as soon as possible.

It's one of those films that aspires to profundity but ends up just wallowing in its own triviality. The fault lies largely in Willard Carroll's muddled script, which presents us with far too many characters who have almost nothing new or interesting to say about anything, much less love.The ensemble cast, however, is stellar, particularly Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Gillian Anderson, Jon Stewart, and Angelina Jolie (a fiercely talented young actress who gives this film a jolt of energy whenever she is onscreen).I particularly found the scenes between Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Edwards tiresome and pointless. Willard spends so much time jumping back and forth in this circus of under-developed characters that we are not allowed to care for any of them as individuals. And those we do end up caring for we do so only from the artistry of the actors who play them. This is certainly the case for Angelina Jolie's free spirited club girl, as well as Gillian Anderson's tightly wound theatre director.And then, almost like some cheap, last ditch effort to give this muddled mess some form of coherent ending, Carroll throws in a trite plot device that is supposed to make us Ooh and Ahh with glee and wonderment but is just plain insulting. Why? Because anyone who was paying any attention at all during the film could have figured out the ending in a heartbeat.Oh, and another thing. It's almost sacrilege to compare this movie to Robert Altman's scathing but brilliant film, Short Cuts. Short Cuts was a subtle montage of extremely complex characters who were each, in their own way, dealing with inner demons that threatened to destroy them. At the very least, Altman's film was a bold experiment both in storytelling and cinematic minimalism.Playing by Heart, on the other hand, is nothing more than light entertainment that will (and should) be forgotten as soon as the credits roll.

Willard Carroll writes just like he directs for immediate impact only, without regard to the characters he's spotlighting in a scene or to what follows dramatically thereafter. He panders to an audience's base emotions, which sometimes leaves his follow-through seeming empty or halfhearted. After losing her son to AIDS, grieving Ellen Burstyn is invited to a neighbor's celebration, where she is greeted warmly and then forgotten about. Dennis Quaid improvises a phony life story to an all-seeing, all-knowing drag queen, who calls Quaid out on his lie and then disappears. Carroll isn't interested in his smartest creations--he's mainly after warm hugs and kisses (which we are flooded with near the end). Some may see the writer-director's proverbial third-act ribbon-wrapping as clever and uncanny, but nothing is really accomplished by crisscrossing the paths of these people...it's simply a writer's folly.

Madeleine Stowe, bored with her marriage to Dennis Quaid, seeks danger and excitement in the eyes of a nervous lover (Anthony Edwards). Gregarious Angelina Jolie presses her charms upon Ryan Phillipe, who rebuffs her for painful and personal reasons. Meanwhile, Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands play an old married couple discussing an affair that may or may not have happened when Sean wore a younger man's clothes. Throw in Dennis Quaid's own late-night adventures and a moving B story of a young man dying of AIDS (Jay Mohr, in an impressive departure from his usual smart-guy persona), and you have a rich tapestry of those who live and love in this great American city. In the end, a series of connections between all the characters are revealed, and while some of the tied-up loose ends are a little too pat, the overall theme of human connection itself is sweet and life-affirming.

The film's structure is somewhat unusual, in that one pair gets a minute or two of screen time, followed by a second pair, then a third. These short stories rotate, and progress independent of each other. As a result, through much of the film, the overall plot seems disjointed. However, the film's writers do unify these various, seemingly unrelated, plot strands toward the end. The short stories of Joan and Keenan, Paul and Hannah, and Mildred and Mark I found more interesting than the stories of the other characters.As implied by the film's title, human emotions have major import love, anger, disappointment, humor, affection, resentment, and so on. Not surprisingly, there's lots of dialogue; and the dialogue contains significant subtext. The film's pace is slow and methodical; the film has a very laid-back feel to it. At times, you would think you were watching a TV soap opera.The lives of these characters are upscale. As such, the film exudes elegance and refinement, as well as, in the case of Joan and Keenan, youthful hip. Production design is lavish; costumes tend to be chic. Background music is eclectic, with some emphasis on slow, laid-back jazz. Acting ranges from fair to very good. I especially liked the performances of Angelina Jolie, and the always-reliable Gena Rowlands, Sean Connery, and Ellen Burstyn.The film does a nice job of putting these characters' lives within the context of the larger environment in which they all live ... Los Angeles. Many times throughout, we see the L.A. skyline and all those palm trees. It's as if the city itself is a character, with a tacit influence on these people's lives and emotions.I'm not sure that the film really imparts anything new to viewers. All these relationships tend to be rather typical, or contrived, depending on your point of view. Still, as pleasant diversionary fluff, the film is worth a one-time viewing to get the general ambiance. But to really understand the intricacies and subtleties of these characters and their lives, I suggest a second viewing.

Maybe it's just that I'm so used to the fairly wooden FBI agent she portrays on The X-Files, but I was quite pleasantly surprised by her performance in what must have been a challenging role.Congratulations to Angelina Jolie for keeping her clothes on and allowing us to focus on her acting, since it's the best part of the film.  I absolutely loved the scenes where she quits drinking and when she hangs up the phone. Her reactions are such a pleasure to watch!Ryan Phillippe was a great counterpoint for Jolie's up-tempo character.  I don't think it would have hurt the film one bit if he had been sharing needles with his girlfriend.  I didn't like his character being portrayed as a complete victim.  His focus on sobriety would have made more sense too.Jon Stewart is still struggling to define himself as an actor/comedian/whatever.  He's talented and funny, I wish he'd stop trying so hard.Dennis Quaid did a good job, but he might as well have been in an entirely different film for all the relevance it had to the plot.  Anthony Edwards and Madeleine Stowe were utterly useless; that whole story line should have been dropped.Connery, Rowlands and Burstyn provided the solid performances one might expect from that lot.  It's two bad Carroll couldn't have cut those last two storylines and allowed them to provide a solid foundation to build up the Jolie/Phillippe and Stewart/Anderson relationships.The scenes with a mother bonding with her dying son were moving, but does it always have to be AIDS?  Gay people get cancer too.  And sometimes even people who aren't gay have trouble connecting with their parents.Even though I disliked Short Cuts because the content was so vile, I do respect it on the basis of artistic expression alone.  I don't know how Carroll thought he was going to pull off so many storylines converging into such a tidy ending without seeming to pale in comparison.And I know that this is trivial, but could Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands possibly have had three white kids that looked less like they are related than those three women?  Phillippe would have been much more believable as their grandson than Jolie was as their daughter.Ok, it could have been better in a lot of ways.  But they really did accomplish a lot.  First, it was upbeat without a sugary Hollywood ex machina ending--no small feat.  It was emotionally moving without making you feel too used, unlike the work of some other directors (paging Mr. Spielberg?).  Carroll had something to say, and although it's not the first movie ever to address love and difficult relationships, I think his heart was in the right place, and I have to give credit for that.I believe that if they had addressed the plot issues this could have been an Oscar-worthy film.

I am glad to see that most of the visitors share my opinion as the vote of the movie is very high. The couples in the film were very suitable, Angelina and Ryan were a splendid couple, both very beautiful, and Sean and his wife too. I wish I can see them in more movies like this one, and I wish they look the same in all their other movies as in this one, because here everybody looks great!

It is the couple who are willing to give themselves 100% without questions to make a relationship work and even if it doesn't last, it was worth the journey. I first saw this movie with my teenage sister and we both laughed and cried until the very end. Plus how can you not get completely swallowed up by these performances.

The movie was completely original and focused primarily on the lives of three women, whom are related. The movie created a unique, fictitious plot that centered in romance, deception, and real feelings of people. I liked the movie because it was very mellow and down-to-earth, yet possessed many great actors and actresses. I think the only downfall of this movie was it didn't attract people who are pessimistic. Also, the movie tended to be rather chronologically complicated. An average person watching this movie, might have found it too confusing yet dramatic for their liking. The movie only attracted a few audiences, rather than quite a few diverse audiences. The movie wasn't super successful due to this.

The story followed four different couples; married, engaged, dating and cheating. Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart literally bumped into each other and are about to venture out on a first date. Angelina Jolie is crazy for a guy she met at the club (Ryan Phillipe), Anthony Edwards and Madeline Stowe are cheating on their respective spouses. This makes for an interesting viewing and ending, which was a complete twist, and a pleasant shock. Playing By Heart has a lot of complex storylines that really works.This was a film of epic proportions and showed what it had to take to maintain relationships and what love really is and what it will do if people truly love their spouses. I was impressed with everyone's performance; however, I must point out the most outstanding one, which was by Angelina Jolie. Jolie has finally come out from her father's shadow and created one heck of a resume of films that includes Gia and The Bone Collector among others.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

After seeing all of the subplots with the characters like Joan and Keenan, Merideth and Brock, Gill and Gracie, Hannah and Mark, and the rest of the cast.  The movie's main focus is solely on Joan, Keenan, Hannah and Mark.  The rest of the cast seems to just fill in the gaps to what those previously mentioned characters do not fill.  The story was great though because you really feel for the characters.

Surprisingly, the story sounded a bit more fleshed out than I had imagined, and, with the wonderful cast that it boasted, I decided to give it a try.BINGO! This is a beautifully crafted romance, full of interesting and slowly revealed storylines that keep you glued to the tv. The one exception would be the adulterous romance between Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards), which is boring at best and only serves to tie up a few loose ends with everything else at the end. I particularly enjoyed the roles played by Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe, definitely the most enjoyable and dramatic relationship in the movie, but Gillian Anderson also did an admirable job as the woman who has been burned one too many times.The best part of this movie (besides Jolie and Phillippe) was the way that all the separate stories somehow managed to converge at the end in a manner that only added to the separate tales. I would have liked to have seen more of Jay Mohr's character (he factors in to the final equation, but his lacking screen time dims the effect a bit), but my complaints stop here. Excellent film if you want a good romance with sincere, emotional scenes and very little crap (admit it, lots of movies have tons of unnecessary crap mixed with the good stuff) in between.

It ranges from a reevaluated relationship between a mother and her son who is dying of AIDS contracted from a long term boyfriend; to a new relationship between a suave, popular, professional man and a woman who has learned to distrust men; to a married couple celebrating its fortieth anniversary despite new knowledge of a tumor in the husband's brain.  Each of the stories presents, at first glance, a typical relationship between people but then the experiences reveal themselves as unique and interesting; each with its own little twist or obstacle to overcome.  This aspect of the movie makes it more than a banal love story. It is more like the unpredictability of real life.   Playing by Heart is structured as a series of few minute long scenes from each of the stories and ends by tying them all together at the end.

They have the most thankless roles, but I hate Madeline Stowe anyway and I have never heard of Anthony Edwards.  They do, however play these roles well.Meredith and Trent are the funniest couples to watch.  They are played wonderfully by Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart.  It's amazing to see Jon go from 'The Daily Show' to this romantic/comical/dramatic role.  He makes the transition very well.  Gillian Anderson's character is very similar to Agent Scully on 'The X Files' (not that i'm complaining).  She is very good as Meredith, a woman who got out of a bad relationship and just can't let someone in.Joan and Keenan are also very fun to watch.

It might be a bad experience or a good one. Sort of like life you know! You just have to live!  The cast is great and the acting also. I was specially impressed with Angelina Jolie I know she won an Oscar and all that, but this is the first movie that I watched her work . About half  through the movie this guy likes her better once he sees her hair in rollers, and that is no a way to go dancing. I like the way the story is told and how everything mergers at the end.

This film however really stood out for me. Talking about love is like dancing about architecture, well I think this film did both! It was sweet, funny and a little wacky with a sprinkle of the odd implausibility. With such a stellar cast line up that could do no wrong coupled with some creative writing producing and directing this film really had a lot going for it before it even started.I found this to be an enlightening and varied investigation of sorts into love and all of its catastrophes and triumphs. Following the stories of five individual situations through and then tying it all together in such a neat and clever way I thought was a credit to all involved. Many a film has endeavored a similar approach and failed dismally in the tying up of loose ends.The performances were fantastic on most fronts. Those that stood out particularly for myself were Sean Connery and Angelina Jolie. Both bought wit, humor and passion to their roll, which I feel really stood as a solid backbone for the production. Also Gillian Anderson was notable, her role I felt was played exceptionally with the perfect blend of, I think to a degree, reluctance yet willingness and need. Definitely no Scullyness, which I'm sure, was probably a point she wanted to make. Just as important I felt was Ellen Burstyn's role, which also proved a passionate and likable character, which only came about through the spot on portrayal.I think the movie fell down in that a couple of the stories were; a) not given enough of a part, or b) was useless and given too much time. The balance I felt for two perhaps three of the five could have been played a little differently. The end however had me forget any misgivings I had mustered and I left not only satisfied but also impressed!I'll admit that all in all it is probably corny and a little unrealistic but hey, we all need a little of that! I must say that I was left guessing until the end (well close enough) which is always a pleasure, and The characters were lovely to watch and certainly personable to which the viewer could relate, and believable, all of which for me is what a film is ALL about.

It was a little bit odd to see Gillian Anderson in a role other than stone-cold Scully, but while odd, it was very refreshing at the same time. Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands were also very good in their roles, and they made Hannah and Paul believable as an aged(not old) married couple.The most confusing part of the movie was Dennis Quaid's characters, who only made some sense at the end. Frankly, I could have done without his part of the story, if not, then at least with more insight into Hugh as Hugh, rather than somebody else.While I do my part in the fight for AIDS, and the scenes between Mark and Meredith were perfection in the reconciliation between a mother and her dying gay son, I felt that maybe Carroll pushed the issue of AIDS  is a hurtful disease too far when he also gave Keenan HIV.All in all, it took quite some time to really get into the movie, but it did make me do some deep thinking about love, life, and yada yada...however, because I enjoyed the movie even more when I turned on the closed-captioning, maybe the story would have faired better as a book, even though I enjoyed the movie very much.

Love love love it.  It's smart without being pretentious, sweet without being sappy, political without being polemical, and absolutely wonderful.  Angelina Jolie is luminous and amazing, as always.  But nearly everyone else in this movie is just as good, if more low-key.  Jolie meets her match in Ryan Philippe, whose deft handling of a difficult role was impressive for an actor so young.  Gena Rowlands and Sean Connery are funny, sharp, and warm as an older couple taking stock of their 40-year marriage.  Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart do a great job of portraying a couple navigating around her emotional land mines.  Stewart showed real leading man potential, coming off as sexy, smart, and sweet. Ellen Burstyn and Jay Mohr made me cry as a mother reconciling with her son, who's dying of AIDS.  Madeleine Stowe is probably the weakest link here, but even she is adequate as an unsatisfied wife having an affair with a man who wants more from her, played by Anthony Edwards.  Dennis Quaid is astonishing as a man who shows up in a different bar, playing an entirely different character, every night.  Believe it or not, all these story lines come together beautifully at the end.What I love most about this movie is that all the characters seem so genuine.  These are real grown-ups doing their best to solve their problems. It was honest and funny and brave, and at the end of the movie I was both laughing and crying.

Bad news first Anthony Edwards and Madeline Stowe make a very unconvincing couple.  This isn't any fault in their acting (Stowe is great in a couple of scenes), but the script, which neither develops the relationship and hopes that the audience won't catch on to the contrivances.  No such luck.  The other story that isn't completely satisfying is Dennis Quaid, as a man who goes on an improv spree and tells tall (tragic) tales to strangers that he meets.  This story ultimately leads no where, which is a disappointment.  However, the other four stories more than make up for the above two.  Rowlands and Connery (in two marvelously modulated performances), play a husband and wife coming to terms with his 'affair' that occurred twenty-five years prior.  This story works very well because it is written like a short story or a one act play.  Ellen Burstyn gives a powerhouse performance as a mother just coming to grips with her son's illness (AIDS, as we led to believe).  This story isn't given too much time, which is a shame, but Burstyn and Mohr (as her son) are incredible in their brief scenes.  Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart are marvelous together.  This is one story where you can tell they act off each other.  Gillian Anderson is a special treat, because we get to see her laugh and we get to see her nervous, which isn't something that Dana Scully reveals too often.  The story is simply two people who try to get together, but her fear of being hurt prevents that.  Jon Stewart also does wonderful work, in a very credible performance  Easily the most surprising of the relationship was the one between Jolie and Phillipe.  With this film, Jolie proved she was a talent to watch, and Phillipe surprised with his convincing turn as an aloof character (without turning uninteresting).  They are combustible together, and heartbreaking when we see how much they are in love.    Similar to the recently released (and ignored) Living Out Loud, this treads the same ground, but treads lightly and well, leaving a generally satisfying film (with a wonderful converging ending).  A charmer, if not perfect.

It follows these themes of love, relationships, anger and sadness through the lives of a seemingly disparate groups of people - Paul, Hannah, Meredith, Trent, Gracie, Roger, Hugh, Joan, Kenan, Mark and Mildred.Some of these are in actual couples, some are potential couples, some are related, but each is real. It's not easy to give a complex, believable personality to each of such as large cast in a two-hour film, but writer-director Willard Carroll manages it in the main. Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards) are too rarely seen outside the bedroom, and the tragic Mark (Jay Mohr) is a little hard done by, but their stories, to be fair, are the least integral.Of the cast, the always-reliable Gena Rowlands and Ellen Burstyn are very good, but notable performances come from actors who aren't often asked to do much acting - Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson and Dennis Quaid in particular. The real star, however, is Angelina Jolie, who starts out by making you genuinely want to smack her, but who proves herself so vulnerable and sweet that she just demands to be hugged, frankly.It's Joan's (Jolie) relationship with Kenan (Ryan Phillippe) which provides the key moments in the film, but Paul and Hannah (Connery and Rowland) hold it together with their own gentle, weary revelations. Eventually all the threads intertwine in a rather predictable manner, but the movie is none the worse for it as pretty much everything you want to happen, happens. Playing By Heart is always engaging and has an emotional resonance that too few films have these days. It's nice to watch grownups do grownup things every now and then.

Not only is the above-the-title cast amazing, but when I saw Patricia Clarkson appear out of nowhere (in Dennis Quaid's first scene), I was thrilled.  I will also say right off the bat that Anjelina Jolie is an actress whose talent far surpasses her considerable beauty.  But, the script...  It starts off my saying Talking about love is like dancing about architecture, meaning that talking about love is senseless and can't be done with any weight or meaning.  In the end, the film actually congratulates for proving that saying wrong.  In between, we get two hours of people doing very little but talking very openly about how they feel about their relationships.  God forbid any of these people had something to hide or keep private from one another.  There are even two scenes with Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Edwards that are almost identical in their dialogue, which is all about how she likes not having strings and he wants more from their trysts than sex. Gillian Anderson's Meredith is forced by the script to openly say things like (you're) too good to be true and when asked if she's been burned by love, she replied Scalded.  What a first date!  I don't just mean romantically; I mean dramatically.  She can't hide her pain so he can try to find it and overcome it?  The only of the many segments in the film that remotely works is the one between free-spirited Joan (Jolie) and the target of her affections played by Ryan Phillipe.  Her character actually talks about her life and relationships in order TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS from Phillipe's.  Namely, she's opening up, so he will.  (He's the only person in the film with a secret someone else is actively trying to uncover.  Other characters, Quaid's in particular, have secrets, but only the audience is privy to them.  No one else is trying to make any discoveries.)  The film is long-winded, astonishingly self concious amd dull.

Ostensibly, part of the film is invested in the mystery of how all these characters are interrelated, but keen viewers will be able to discern the connections among everyone. It's the uniformly excellent performances, though, that make this multi- character drama compulsively watchable. Most striking, surprisingly enough, are Jolie and Phillippe, the youngest members of the cast who reveal heretofore hidden depths of talent. Equally impressive are Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart, who transcend their yuppie persona's in their awkward enactment of the timeless dating rituals. Other cast members are quite good though saddled with story lines that are occasionally less than compelling. The only complaint you'll have is that once everyone's connections are revealed, you'll wish this cast had more of an opportunity to interact.

Today, such inter-connected romantic comedies are even more routine, many released annually by big studios.

Second, some of the stories didn't quite develop as well as the others. For instance, I am not satisfied with the story involving Dennis Quaid, Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Edwards. I also wish there would be a bit more between Jay Mohr and Ellen Burstyn. Overall, this is not a bad movie. In fact I can appreciate the efforts made by Willard Carroll and whoever involved in the production of Playing by Heart. But this movie seems better fit in the TV screen then at a movie theater.

Gillian Anderson is wonderfully world weary and bruised underneath an acidic facade. Her would-be relationship with a suprisingly good Jon Stewart is wryly amusing and touching.  Angelina Jolie steals the show as a pushy motormouth whose aggressive pursuit of withdrawn Ryan Phillipe is the films highlight.Also on the plus side is seeing Phillipe actually act (as opposed to his usual all purpose cool detachment face) and Sean Connery romancing someone his own age, as well a his priceless impersonation of a dog.On the negative side, the Madeleine Stowe/Anthony Edwards subplot is unconvincing and Dennis Quaid is plain annoying for the first half of the film.All in all, it is Short Cuts lite, but still well worth watching.

Three women, Gillian Anderson, Angelina Jolie (my personal favourite) and Madeleine Stowe all have relationship troubles and are currentlly trying to work them out Stowe is having a clandestined sex-only affair with a friend (Anthony Edwards) who's not her husband, Jolie is in love with anti-relationship man Ryan Philippe, and Anderson can't allow herself to like Jon Stewart, even though he's nuts about her and seems to be quite perfect for her as well. Along the lines we also get to watch Gena Rowlands Sean Connery battle it out as a couple re-evaluating their relationship after forty years of marriage, Dennis Quaid trying out improv acting exercises by pretending to be different people in singles bars, and Ellen Burstyn comforting her son (Jay Mohr) in his last days before dying of AIDS. The real cheat is that Burstyn and Mohr's scenes are among the most touching in the film and are seen so sparingly-these guys really deserved more screen time. All these stories tie themselves up beautifully in the end with Altmanesque flair by director Willard Carroll, who shows a huge amount of talent when it comes to giving characters snappy dialogue and genuine feeling. Hopefully you will also be swept away by just how elegant the entire production is the way I was. Watch it again and again and you'll discover new things you never noticed before.

Like most people, I found the Gracie/Roger affair dull.  Without a good performance by Dennis Quaid, I wouldn't have cared what happened to Gracie or her marriage.  As far as the Trent and Merideth courtship goes,  Anderson and Stewart played their roles well.  Who knew John Stewart had it in him?  He played the nice guy role better than many well-experienced actors have.  Moving on, I didn't really care too much about Mark's dying or his mother's subsequent anguish. Call me heartless, but other than giving me a chance to hit the bathroom or grab a snack, their scenes didn't contribute much to this film.  Sean Connery's performance showed that he still has great range, and I think it was his dialogue that made the older couple worth watching.  Finally, I have to agree with everyone else...  the movie would have been worth very little were it not for the chemistry between Jolie and Phillipe.  Keenan (Phillipe) contributes very little to conversations with Joan (Jolie), but Phillipe delivers every line appropriately.  Jolie steals the show with her portrayal of Joan as a down-to-earth, emotionally electric beauty with undying faith in love.  She plays the part as if it were in some way an extension of herself, and I'm surprised she didn't get more acclaim for this role.  The only thing that I wondered after seeing this film was whether Keenan had HIV or AIDS, or simply some other STD.  He says that his past love shared one more thing with him before she died and that he is damaged goods, but when he comes to Joan's place to announce that he wants to be with her, he says that the only way he can do so is if they don't have sex, at least for the time being.  What does this mean?  That sex is too much for him now and that later he'll be ready?  That sex would be risky for Joan?  Help me out here.  If he does have HIV or AIDS, I'm surprised it was never more closely focused on.  But anyway, this movie above all reminded me how well ideal love can be portrayed, though often it is not realized as such.  I love this film and would recommend it anyone.

A funny film that manages to bring strong enough themes to actually give a cast that has been as lauded as this one something to work with without tripping over each other's egos and conflicting styles. Sean Connery gives his best performance in years (anyone else remember The Avengers?). Gena Rowlands is a perfect opposite to him. Ryan Philippe has a fairly superficial role, but the fact that he manages to share the screen with Angelina Jolie and not end up like a deer in the headlights is accomplishment enough. The least developed of the plots falls to Madeeline Stowe and Anthony Edwards. Is the plot interesting? It could have been. The actors chew scenery at level best, but their story has too many open ended questions, and the script never does much to make them particularly sympathetic or really likeable. I admit that the format is derivative, and some of the themes are by now borderline cliche, and it is definitely not fare for all, but the film manages to take a theme like love and not turn into a cliche itself and that deserves recognition with an apparently random character like Quaid's providing some of the most meaningful scenes.

Angelina Jolie is crazy for a guy she met at the club (Ryan Phillipe), Anthony Edwards and Madeline Stowe are cheating on their respective spouses. This makes for an interesting viewing and the end, which was a complete twist, not only tied everything up, it was a pleasant shock. Playing By Heart has a lot of complex storylines that really works.This was a film of epic proportions and showed what it had to take to maintain relationships and what love really is and what it will do if people truly love their spouses. I was impressed with everyone's performance; however, I must point out the most outstanding one, which was by Angelina Jolie. Jolie has finally come out from her father's (Jon Voight) shadow and has created one heck of a resume of films that includes Gia and The Bone Collector.I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend this film to everyone.

Not because it wasn't a great film but because I didn't see a lot of movies in 1998. They all looked like mindless drivel to me, but I picked this one up at my local video store. It would be an understatement to say that this film was good. this has been one of the most honest and refreshingly wonderful movies I have seen in a while. The relationships between the characters were sweet, and in some cases bittersweet.The relationship between Hannah and Paul was one of the bittersweet ones that I mentioned. They love each other, they spent their lives together, they have children together, but that doesn't mean the don't have problems. Their relationship was very realistic and very true.The mother/son relationship between Mark and Mildred was the most heart breaking I have ever seen represented in a film. I cried just about everytime they were on-screen together.The relationship between Meredith and Trent was the most believable and the most real. Meredith being a person scorned by love and afraid to open herself up again, and Trent being a lonely divorcee just trying to get Meredith to realize that he's not in this to hurt her. Both of their reactions were realistic.But I'd have to say the most interesting relationship in the film, to me anyway, was the one between Joan and Keenan. They are complete opposites who happen into the company of one another, causing a strong attraction on both sides that eventually evolves into something deeper. I won't give away anything because I'm not one to spoil movies, but Keenan's story was extremely compelling. Joan's reaction was exactly what I expected from her, and the resolution was the absolute sweetest I have ever seen. And I just have to add that Angelina Jolie was amazing in this film. This is Ryan Phillippe at his best, I don't think he has ever been any better in any other movie than what he was in this one.The ending all comes together nicely, making this a great film. Yes there are slow parts, yes some things are a little strange, but all in all this is a very good movie. Rent it, open your mind, and enjoy.

A truly enjoyable film that gets interested in the character's lives and what happens to them.  The film starts out by introducing each character and their little subplots; I guess that word could sum up most of the movie -- sub-plot.  The movie is made up of four or five different sub-plots that follow the lives of the characters and how they view life and love.  From a mother whose son is dying of AIDS to a disillusioned husband who frequents bars and practices his improv. (read lying) skills to a few people who have been burned by love in the past . . . we see a large variety of people who have nothing, and yet everything in common.  A romantic comedy/drama, one of its only flaws is an occasionally weak script; however, this little fact is easily overlooked by the wonderful performances and the touching stories.  When the credits finally rolled, I felt satisfied and happy . . . Playing by Heart definitely has a cathartic ending . . . but that's all I can say . . . to say more would reveal the ending, and that is definitely one of the coolest parts of the movie.  The movie is appropriately rated (R) because of language and implied sex; however, there is no nudity, no real sex scenes (we see the before and after shots, no action shots) so I feel that it is an appropriate movie for parents to take their older (15+) teen-agers to see.

But it ain't going to stop me from trying.Often, when a film endeavors to untangle the complicated and perplexing mystery that is love, it either results in a sappy and maudlin affair that is immediately labeled a chick flick and soon forgotten in a Blockbuster wasteland or a hackneyed and pedestrian story with robotic characters and a predictable happily every after ending.  Playing By Heart is definitely, most definitely, neither. It attempts to answer the much mulled-over question, What *is* love? and does so successfully with admirable wit and charm, standing out in a roomful of romantic- comedies released in the past several years that sorely lack the spirit and soul this ensemble piece has managed to capture.Well-written, marvelously intelligent, and moving, Playing By Heart surrounds the relationships and the mishaps of those relationships of a group of individuals, all wonderfully depicted by their portrayers and each romantic pair providing their own essence to the overall story.  Seasoned acting veterans Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands shine as Hannah and Paul, a couple on the brink of their fortieth anniversary trying to overcome a secret from the past that could easily destroy their marriage.  Their performances are heartfelt and sincere, bringing to the film an indescribable charisma and grace that has unfortunately been missing from cinematic romances of recent times.  Gillian Anderson as reluctant lover Merideth and Jon Stewart as persistent yet lovable Trent (a role that has best shown off his comic ability and undeniable charm) share a remarkable chemistry that some of the movie's most entertaining and humorous moments revolve around. But the twosome that truly steals the film away are rising stars Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillipe.  Their talent is undeniable; their scenes, poignant; and their banter, engaging.  As the animated and boisterous smart-ass Joan, Jolie not only captures the heart of jaded-about-love loner Keenan, but the hearts of the audience as well.Surprises come about as viewers realize how each of the eleven main characters are connected to one another (the ties are cleverly concealed until the last twenty minutes or so), but the genuine amazement comes from realizing the true extent of Jay Mohr's acting talent.  Phenomenal and unforgettable, he brilliantly embodies the character of Mark, a young man dying from AIDS.  One of the most memorable scenes in the film are that of him saying a final good-bye to his loving mother, Mildred, who is beautifully portrayed by Ellen Burstyn.An extraordinary combination of humor and heart, bringing together some of the best talents that have ever graced Hollywood, Playing By Heart is not one to miss.

It's a story about relationships;  it's that simple.Gillian Anderson (who won my heart in this movie;  I'm not much of a X-filer, OK???) plays Meredith,  a stageplay director who is very,  VERY single.  By means of an accident,  she meets Trent (Jon Stewart),  who promptly asks her out to dinner.  Across town,  we have an attractive, successful older couple  Paul (the charming as ever Sean Connery) and Hannah (the lovely Gena Rowlands),  who have been married 40 years and who are trying to face old age with grace and courage.  Meanwhile,  a willowy brunette named Gracie (Madeline Stowe) is on the downlow with Roger (Anthony Edwards),  and while he is yearning for a deeper relationship with her, she is content to keep it strictly sexual,  no mutual history,  no personal history,  no guilt involved.  In still another part of town,  a man named Hugh (Dennis Quaid) carouses bar after bar,  meeting woman after woman, (or perhaps drag queen?), telling strange and tragic tales to sympathetic ears. In the throbbing club scene,  a blue haired boy named Keenan (Ryan Phillipe) loans his last quarter to Joan,  a girl who is screaming banshee-like at her ex-beau over the phone.  Across the miles in a Chicago hospital room,  a dying young man named Mark (Jay Mohr) and his grief-striken mother Mildred (Ellen Burstyn) open their hearts to one another for the last,  and probably the first,  time.It is like five stories about five relationships within one movie,  but all of the characters are connected,  and most of them are interesting.  I was so able to relate to Meredith (Anderson) because she has been hurt is so afraid of losing control and being vulnerable to the opposite sex.  Trent (Stewart) is very realistic in his reaction to the wall Meredith built around herself.  I am a huge Angelina Jolie fan,  and she once again proved her acting ability as Joan, tough on the outside but tender on the inside. And this is the best acting Ryan Phillippe has ever done.Low points of the movie  I wasn't really sure what was going on with Dennis Quaid's part of the story (although he did a terrific job),  and Madeline Stowe's character seemed to be a selfish,  petty loser.

Her film husband Sean Connery is as dashing and handsome as he was playing James bond, and the impeccable speech along with that voice that could melt an iceberg still bring women young and old to their knees.

If there is any fault with this film is that there too many good actors and characters for the little over two hours.  I really wish the film had been three hours.  Mr. Carroll has written (also directed) a story that intertwines and connects love and lover(s) in a most entertaining way.  I would not want to say anything more about the premise than that.  This film made me laugh out loud and also cry.  The highlight of the film is the relationship between Joan (Angelina Jolie) and Keenan (Ryan Phillippe). These two are dynamite and look forward to seeing more of both.  Mark (Jay Mohr), a young man dying from AIDS, and his mother, Mildred (Ellen Burstyn), were also excellent.  The other were good as well.  This you MUST see on video if you like romance and comedy.  Three and a half stars!!!

The whole Anthony Edwards/Madeline Stowe thing was just weird (if you've seen the end, you'll understand).  There were three things that saved the film though.  The characters Meredith and Trent were great in this film.  Don't be confused into thinking that I am saying that the acting was good.  Just the characters.  Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands are good thing number two.  They were magnificent in this film, but it was the characters that seemed to be lacking when compared to the acting talent. Good thing number three is easily the greatest thing in the movie.  Joan, played by the fabulous Angelina Jolie, saved the movie.  She was the best character in the whole movie and Angelina played the part beautifully.  If she really deserves a Golden Globe (she won for Gia), it should have been for this movie.

There's nothing to tell without completely giving the story away (and if you don't want to know anything about it, be careful of reading other comments regarding this movie in this area, because so far 2 people tell the entire story which just blows the whole concept).If you don't enjoy love stories, then this is not a movie for you.  It's a quadruple love story with a little mother/son understanding and a dose of spouse doing some soul searching  6 different stories going on at once. Everyone meets up at the end, and if you pay attention you can enjoy trying to figure out how they all relate during the movie. But don't talk too much trying to figure it out, or you will miss vital parts of the conversations. You will also miss some incredible acting by Angelina Jolie (Voight), who has most of the dialogue and Ryan Phillipe, who has a perfect rapport with her.  John Stewart surprized me in his natural ability to act along with Gillian Anderson, who in my eyes can do no wrong.  The rest of the cast does a great job also.  If nothing else, go for Sean Connery who is always at his best.I believe that certain people don't like this movie because there are too many words for them to follow.  Again, I would recommend it.  Both times that I saw it, the entire theatre stayed put at the ending credits for at least 3 minutes while taking in all they had just seen.

About two-thirds into the movie is when the story starts to come together full circle, and it is satisfying to realize how clever the storytelling unfolds before us. Juggling and intercutting five pairs of relationship is no easy task, yet it sure seems so seamlessly one piece.It's like watching the weaving of a tapestry the various details woven first and in the end we see all the elements (pairings) wonderfully interwoven together. As the camera pulls away -- with the help of a high angle shot shooting down -- I kinda felt that God was looking down and was pleased with the work of the guardian angels on the hearts of these earthlings which can be tamed.Along the lines of taming of the hearts and lessons in relationships, two movies come to mind 1) The very creative script and well-directed surprise from Alan Jacobs' Nina Takes a Lover 1994 - Laura San Giacomo and Paul Rhys with Fisher Stevens; 2) The heartfelt beyond charm of a movie from Glenn Gordon Caron's Picture Perfect - Jennifer Aniston and Jay Mohr with Kevin Bacon.

Runners-up include Gillian Anderson, Gena Rowlands and Ellen Burstyn. The one brief scene between the two latter performers was genuinely moving -- no dialogue, just a shared look of understanding and empathy between two women that managed to speak volumes about motherhood, grief and friendship.Jolie is the stand-out of the considerable cast. Her character's exuberance and wealth of hope are infectious, and the wit and kindness of Joan were charming and entertaining. Quaid's ability to shift from one sad sack personality to another, only to seemingly shrink into the true sadness of his actual personality and emotional life was astounding. My feelings for his character Hugh shifted from amused disgust to genuine pity by the movie's climax. As for Stewart, he does a fine job as Anderson's suitor, a kind and emotionally-centered fellow who's willing to put his feelings on the line for a woman who's afraid to love again.Anderson does well with the character of Meredith. I have a feeling that her performance could have benefitted from stronger direction, but she acquits herself nicely with what she is given. Her interaction with Stewart is funny and has genuine spark; I could see these two characters as a couple. Rowlands does marvelously as a strong-willed woman who is struggling with feelings of anger and betrayal, but you never lose sight of the fact that she feels much love for her husband, played by Sean Connery.Last but not least, Ellen Burstyn gives a fine performance as a woman facing the impending death of her son, who is afflicted by AIDS. There are nuances to her work that are rare to see, and it's a shame that we don't get to see much of her in the film (or other films).I urge people to watch Playing by Heart -- it isn't the best film that I've seen, but the price of admission is more than earned by the pleasure of watching such a skilled cast.

Willard Carroll wrote and directed this ambitious film that owes much to Robert Altman in terms of structure.  Here several different stories and dramatic situations come together in unexpected ways in the end of the complex, melancholly, emotionally draining, and, on occasion, profound movie.  To summarize these many stories would be impossible and would give away too much.  Carroll is very good at setting up a potentially silly and cliched situation, and then turning it on its head with a surprise that makes it all seem real.  The only thing that disappoints is the very ending, which seems a bit rushed and perfect for its own good.  But the getting there is enough of a reward. Performances all around are worthy of praise, with Gena Rowlands, Sean Connery, Ellen Burstyn, Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, and--oddly--Jay Mohr standing out above the very good rest.

A frightfully over emotional 'American' movie that presumably felt it could follow the TV success of a show like '30 Somethings' and do the multi-strand jump cutting of 'Babel' with everything coming together at the end. Well, it didn't work. You assemble a great cast of pros - the Weinsteins looking for a left field hit that might pick up some Oscar traction - and make an auteur film about love that is supposed to make you feel better!! Uh, no, I was depressed fairly soon in - what with the ridiculous Dennis Quaid strand talking about running over his wife and child (yes!), and a young man dying, a la 'Philadelphia' of AIDS!! Talk about cheap shots and sentimentality that would have made John Ford blush in shame! The storyline is of various couples of various ages ( and quickly it becomes clear are all part of one family) talking about love, trying to find love, and actually having affairs. I'm afraid it loses credibility because several of the actresses post-coital have very carefully wrapped sheets or duvets around themselves demonstrating a complete lack of spontaneity (although that is the point I suppose, as the film is all too much talk and cod philosophising about love to be really credible. There is interest in the Ryan Phillippe/Angelina Jolie and Sean Connery/Gena Rowlands elements, but because of the too many strands, even these are rushed, overwrought and concluded far too quickly. A pity because they might have made a half decent movie. But ultimately the film is crushed by its own sense of po-faced theatricality and verbiage - yet again Americans taking themselves too seriously.

I went with three other people, one of whom was wearing a watch that lit up the time, (definitely a necessity with this film), and from now on this watch will be known as the The Interminable Movie Watching watch!

I don't think it had anything fresh or particularly insightful to say about love or the human condition.  Willard Carroll is no Robert Altman, although the movie begs comparison to Altman films, like Short Cuts, which follow the stories of various people in one city.  But, I thought there was at least one too many story lines.  The one with Jay Mohr and Ellen Burstyn was certainly moving and they were both excellent, but it really doesn't belong in this particular piece.  I would have liked to have seen Mr. Carroll leave their story out, and beef up a couple of the story lines that didn't play out very well.  The acting was very good, though, particularly by Angelina Jolie.  I'm glad I saw it, but I wouldn't recommend it too strongly.

And I certainly like romantic comedies, but this movie was just unbearable. I came in expecting something decent at least, considering the 7+ rating here, but geez was I ever wrong. How a movie this tepid and uninteresting got such a high rating is beyond me. I can only assume that the incredible star power involved skewed the ratings.A quote from the movie was that talking about love was like dancing about architecture. I think it should have been changed to making a movie about love is like talking about architecture, with this movie being a prime example. Someone give me my 2 hours back.

I mean with three actors and actresses that have six nominations and two statues between them, you'd expect them to carry the film, but they don't. Sean Connery is easily the best &#145;oldie' and he does not have that much of a character or good lines to really stand out in this film (neither does any other &#145;oldie' in this film), with Ellen Burstyn (Mark's mom) probably having the best potential role of any &#145;oldie'. Now on to the three people who steal the show here Ryan Philippe, Jay Mohr and Angelina Jolie. As for Ryan Phillippe I think it is a real pity that he's only known for youngsters for his roles in I know what you did last summer and Cruel Intentions (in which he was great anyway). He has got real potential and I'd like him to get more challenging roles and see him as a leading man in a good drama. He shows here that he's more than the press make him to be and I think he's way better than his wife (Witherspoon) a an acting professional. It is a real pity that he's not yet made a name for himself as an actor, which maybe not entirely his fault (hint at directors and casting agencies). The same sort of goes for Jay Mohr, who is more famous for Saturday Night Live and comedy films, than his dramatic acting talent. Maybe that's what he likes, but maybe he ought to try drama or serious films more often, I think he can handle it. Angelina Jolie, well there's nothing much to say about her. I mean she has become the most famous one of the four (globally that is) as Tomb Raider Lara Croft and of course as an Oscar Winner (Girl, Interrupted). I really admire that. She saw her talent as a good (and not only as an entertaining) actress and made the best of it. Whether acclaimed or not, whether awarded or not those three can really act and Playing by Heart is the proof.6 out of 10 "}{"Title":"Very absorbing, if not great, film.","Date":"1 February 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  SPOILERS - This film has an all-star cast, and I won't list them here, but Sean Connery and gena Rowlands play the couple, married almost 40 years.  The film cuts often among many characters and we are required to watch closely to begin to figure things out. Turns out the three younger female characters are the three children of Connery/Rowlands. Each has her own issues in love and/or marriage. Dennis Quaid is a boring husband who is in acting class, and goes to bars pretending he is something else as practice. The film covers infidelity, aids, etc. It is all brought together at the climax, the 40th wedding anniversary of the parents and their renewal of mariage vows.Not a great film, but a good film, gets you to think. One thing I particularly didn't like was having a minister, played by Anthony Edwards, be the casual sex partner of Stowe's character, especially since both were married.

Five stories in two hours averages to about 24 minutes per story. If films could captive, entertain, and satisfy the audience in 24 minutes all films would be 24 minutes long. However, they can't. In fact, Playing... doesn't give the viewer sufficient time to get over the fact they're looking at that goofy guy on The Daily Show who upstages his guests or that old guy you've seen play James Bond a hundred times or the boob job that chick from Hackers got or whatever. To pump up this loosing concept the film makers use compelling situations, exaggerated characters, snappy dialogue, and some bigtime acting talent. Bottom line...Playing... is a bad idea and good fodder for couch potatoes. BTW, what exactly is an anger ball?

I'm sure some people would disagree with me, saying that I didn't understand the basis of love and whatnot. But I suppose that's just me being my immature 16 yr. old self.  I didn't really care what happened to the older couple, the Gracie/Hugh/Roger trio, or the mother and son couple.  When I saw Playing By Heart for the first time I cried the whole way through whenever Joan and Keenan where the car AND when they were in her apartment for the second time.  But when Gracie had a tear roll down her eye at the end I was like get Joan and Keenan on the screen NOW!!!  I know that some people really do like Sean Connery but I've never seen a movie with him in it (besides this one).  Actually, the only time I have ever seen anything about him is on Saturday Night Live when they make fun of him!  And being the big X-Files fan that I am, I was thrilled to death to see SOMETHING with Gillian Anderson in (even though Meredith and Scully seemed to have the same phobia of men and relationships).  I feel that the Meredith/Trent couple was the most real of them all!  I think that I could probably relate more to Meredith than any other character though. I thought that the toothpaste scene was gonna make me throw up though b/c Iknew she had to have swallowed all that toothpaste/tooth gunk and I knew that Trent had to have gotten some of that in his mouth.  I was like just spit it out and wash your mouth out before you give him that kiss!!!  I thought that the whole relationship between the women characters was predictable, I knew that there had to be something there.  Although it took me awhile to figure out what the heck Hugh was doing!!  I also didn't know why they gave all the best lines to Jolie!  I think that if they would have given a good script to all of the characters it would have been a REALLY good movie!!  I watched it three times when I rented it b/c it was so good!! It's one of those movies that you get stuck on, and I wasn't really looking forward to taking it back.  I think for sure I'm gonna buy this movie though!!  All in all I would have to give it an 8/10 b/c I liked those two couples that I mentioned earlier the best and they were the only ones I really cared about anyway.

Quaid's spinning a series of lying stories in bars has the most twisted potential (never fulfilled); Jolie has the most joie de vivre and lifts her segments despite Phillippe's utterly anaemic counterplaying; Connery and Rowlands have to cope with a particularly banal series of arguments about a dalliance of his 25 years ago. The premise is that talking about love is	like dancing about architecture, and yet not communication is exalted, and the strands all have to get past some unburdening or facing of weakness - Anderson needs the courage to take a chance; Quaid and Stowe have to start talking to each other. The movie has little visual distinction - the occasional shots of LA transitioning from day to night (it pretty much all happens at night until the light-drenched happy ending) aren't very evocative of anything, and it just ends up seeming like a series of mostly low-energy acting classes in blandly pretty locations.

At the time I was a big x-file fan, but I thought Gillian Anderson should never play a different role any more than the kind she has in Playing by Heart, or should start an affair with Mulder. I never saw Sean Connery without a gun before, but I loved this new character and after seeing this movie I was in love with Angelina Jolie for at least a year.Six years later however, after looking hard for a copy (in Holland it was almost impossible to find) when I watched it for a second time I was very disappointed to my own surprise. The dialog now seems shallow to me and very powerless and the way the movie is shot and the story is told makes me feel like I am watching a soap series (soft-tone lenses, uninspired editing, predictable plot, loaded with clich√©s). Only one thing went trough my mind watching the entire film; why on earth did I like this before?It probably has to do with the state of mind you're in when watching this (or any movie), on the other hand American Beauty or Magnolia for example I can watch over and over and never be bored.

Brooks doing Altman or Rudolph.  A lot of the lines are trying for that snappy Brooks dialogue(like when Keenan(Ryan Phillipe) tells Joan(Angelina Jolie) I don't date, to which she responds, I've never heard that one before.), and trying to mix comedy and drama as well as he does.  The problem is while Carroll is trying at least for grand things - talking about love, death, family - he misses in how to do it.  It's clever when it wants to be insightful, and shallow when it wants to be truthful.  And while there are supposed to be surprises at the end, only one of them really was(which I won't reveal).On the other hand, this can't easily be dismissed, because all of the performers are appealing(even though Anthony Edwards, Dennis Quaid, and Madeline Stowe get stuck with ridiculous subplots, they're always nice to watch).  Even Phillipe, who I normally don't like, comes across pretty well here.  The ones who register the most are Anderson, Connery, Jolie, Rowlands, and Stewart.  Stewart and Anderson feel like a real couple, and they nicely underplay their dialogue, which makes it play even better(especially when Stewart first meets Anderson's dog; Suddenly I feel inadequate may seem like a sitcom line(even though it IS a huge dog), but he makes it seem real).  Jolie clearly relates to these types of roles, and gives all of her lines an extra snap to them.  She's also very expressive here with her face.  Connery and Rowlands also feel like a real couple, and it's nice to see him acting with someone his own age for a change.  Some have questioned whether it's realistic what they would be arguing about, but since she wants to talk about something else and can't, this is her way of getting it out, so I had no problem with that.Overall, it's one of those films saved by good acting, but if Carroll is aspiring to the level of a James L. Brooks, he needs to go deeper.

It's not the cast's fault though, they're all phenomenal actors/actresses who have all done marvelous work before in other films. It's simply a poorly written film. It's interesting to see such a large group of big names all thrown together, and that in itself is a reason to see it. I will say that the story of Joan and Keenan is probably the sweetest, most sensational romance I've witnessed in a long time and for that greatness did not deserve to be thrown in that movie. Jolie and Phillipe's chemistry deserve a film of their own. My advice-Rent it just to watch Keenan and Joan. They are nothing short of fantastic.

Once I stood  for several hours staring at my own ass in the mirror, my ass is neither attractive, nor tight but wasting my time examining its basic curvature seemed more fulfilling than the hour and a half I threw away viewing this film.  How this movie got great actors like Dennis Quaid, Sean Connery, and Jon Stewart I'll never know (Though I predict Gillian Anderson who believed a great deal in this film gave each actor an angerball, a combination of tantric sex and beastiality only to be beleived when examined first hand, to each actor multiple times, except Ryan Phillepe who was shat on by Jay Mohr...multiple times) This may surprise you, the reader, but I do reccomend this film. For one reason and one reason only.  At the end a cameo by Steve Buscemi and Clint Howard both dressed in Easter Bunny outfits is heartfelt and gratifying.  Clint and Steve are made for each other and when they embrace, both singing various tracks from Garth Brooks' Magnum Opus album entitled Don't fuck with an elderly womans vagina you drunken British child named Daniel Gatsby the viewer feels as if he truly has been transported back in time to DaVince's 1957 Europe, complete with flying cars and three headed lesbians.  This cameo lasted only 7 minutes but truly tied the movie together as Clint and Steve both stare into the camera and say Jewish People ROCK!  Because they do.  All of them except Richard Lewis...who is horrible.  I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars, I took one away only because my hatred for Richard Lewis causes me to be cynical and aloof.
