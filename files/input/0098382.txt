Why are they there? Well, Kirk is wearing a girdle and a really bad hairpiece so we have to suffer through the requisite Adlerian male compensation scene; you know I may be as old as God but I can climb mountains with my bare hands. This is supposed to let us know he still packs the gear. Boring. Then we are treated to the sing a long from hell; this is here to dispel all the plethora of rumors that the crew hated his guts and will not be seen with him. Now you know why he wanted to direct so badly don't you. Then we are treated to THE PRINCE OF TIDES; THE SPACE YEARS guest starring Sybok as the most annoying, bad acting therapist from hell. The interminable journey to meet the deity who has probably nodded off at this point. It is his ship, he doesn't know how anything works. The dialog puts the B in badly written. Unfunny humor on the level of the three stooges; action scenes that are boring and badly photographed. Hey, it gets worse. The dance of the seven veils by the geriatric, corpulent Uhura who last had a hot body when Richard Nixon was in the white house. No, that would not have distracted them; they would have vomited. We only see her legs, thanks for that much, I have seen too much already. Why is it dark as night in Lionwoman's lair? Why can't we see anything going on? Is this guy the worst director in the history of talking pictures? The byplay between Spock and Sybok is not funny; it is stupid and unrealistic. See, when you fight people and mutual deaths occur, they do not stop and have a chat with you. Can you tell these people know as much about real battle as they do about fornicating, to quote Patton? The film shows to all aspiring filmmakers the craft of directing and why it is such a powerful role Shatner does nothing right, bad acting, photography, editing, and pacing. Make no mistake, if this had a competent director it would not be half this bad with a capable person overseeing the horrible script. The meeting God scene is beyond bad; 2001 called they want their imagery back. A powerful alien that cannot even kill one of the crew? I know, I was disappointed also. Yes, oh he looked scary, I was shaking. The token Klingon who has to be publicly castrated on the alter of Kirk's manliness. His whole existence is predicated on defeating the great and powerful Jim Kirk. You get the picture, somebody has a bit of an ego problem; the whole universe is rotating about James Tiberius Kirk. Get some therapy. WORSE THAN SLOW STRANGULATION. Fools who imagine the rascalities of imbeciles on earth effect the motion of the planets.

It's really not that bad, if you're a true trekkie. First off, sure the effects are a little low-fi...but so were the TOS episodes. I don't know about you, but I care more about story than effects. The main reason that I like this film because it's very episodic in nature. If you are a fan of the original Star Trek series, sit down and watch this movie as if you were watching one of the original episodes and it will be much more enjoyable. For one, it starts out like an episode with a prologue before the opening credits start. Secondly, the theme music for the movie is similar to that of the original series. Third, there are some lines from the film that sound like they would be right out of one of the older episodes. Lastly, this movie is loosely based on the storyline of an original episode. Ironically, the episode that it's based on is one of the TOS worst episodes The Way the Eden. If you've seen The Way to Eden, the actual plot of the episode is not bad, it's just the hippie stuff that makes it so awful. This film kildly leaves out the awful hippie music of the original episode and focuses solely on the plot instead. I often wonder if Shatner wrote this film to make up for how bad The Way to Eden was. So, to sum up, watch this movie as you would watch an old episode and you'll enjoy it much more.

And upon viewing this on its special edition DVD, my opinion has not changed. This is a film that tries hard but ultimately fails due to poor plotting, sub-par special effects and poor character development. The movie opens with probably the best scene in the film, where you meet Sybok and learn a little about his quest. The visuals alone in the opening shots are very impressive. Then, slowly, scene by scene, the movie falls apart. Yes, there are a few peaks in there, which I will discuss later, but overall, the idea of a God Like Being in the center of our galaxy, it just so illogical.The movie has a lot of embarrassing and just plan bad moments. The first of which is the meeting of three characters who represent the Planet of Galactic Peace. However, their intro is rushed and these characters are not given any depth at all. Why introduce us to these important characters if they care not going to be used in any meaningful (maybe one of them at the end) plot point at all? The direction by William Shatner also seems very uneven. Take the scene with Scotty and Uhura on the bridge. There is a very awkward moment of silence after their main dialogue is over. And the mugging Shatner does when McCoy makes very awkward comments to Spock's story about Sybok is just out of place. And add to that a semi-naked Uhura and Scotty hitting his head for a Three Stooges laugh and you begin to sink in your chair. The Klingon plot seems tacked on just to add depth to the story. And by the time we see where the movie is going, we just feel very disappointed and underwhelmed.That said, I can't help but enjoy the wealth of good character moments in the film. I for one liked the campfire scene and the attempts of deep philosophy about old age and death. I also liked exploring the pain of McCoy and Spock and Kirk's insistence that he needs his pain. While most of the humor was forced and bad, the best had to be the I could use a shower scene, which is one of the biggest laughs in all of the Trek films. There were many moments of good direction by Shatner, especially in McCoy's pain scene. I do sympathize with Shatner a little, when listening to the commentary track, about how this was cut and that was cut but I still think on a whole, this movie was doomed to fail.The DVD's picture is sharp and the sound is excellent. The extras are quite good but I would have liked more insight as to what went wrong with the film besides tight schedule and budget. Shatner's commentary with his daughter is good but has too many quiet moments. Check out the hidden and brief comic reel.At this point in time, I do rank Star Trek V above Nemesis, mainly due to that movie's bad continuity issues but just barely. Still, it is Star Trek and if you like the characters, just sit back, don't expect much and enjoy the show.

So, 12 years after having first seen Star Trek V, and thinking it was bizarrely bad, I gave it a second watch, hoping I would find some redeeming quality which I missed the first time around.I didn't.The writing is half-baked, and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (albeit shakily), the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets. The last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous. What was even worse, from the original cast's POV, is that this was the first ST movie to be released AFTER the franchise returned to television with Next Generation, and the average episode of Next Generation would put this to shame* - including the special effects! What an embarrassment.The Final Frontier isn't thoroughly wretched - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one) that the only reason I can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more.* unless it's an episode with Troi's mother in it.

Trekkie's generally see the movie as the stepchild of the series, and even the Trek establishment writes it off as non-canonical. Many complain that the movie distorts the characters, or exploits them for humor. To them I'd say the movie offers some of the deepest moments in the relationships between Kirk, Spock and McCoy that the series ever had. THIS SHOULD BE STRESSED, in this chapter the three likely have more scenes together than they ever had anywhere else. Not every moment works, but together they grapple with betrayal, joy, doubt, loss. They do it with friendship, camaraderie, heroism and joy that justly makes them one of the most memorable pop-culture phenomena ever. (I do pity the rest of the original cast, most of whom have at least one unenviable scene.)It's great to return to this film and see these guys doing what they do best - long after they retired from the roles. Shatner and Paramount may have bungled a few things here, but I forgive them, because the three leads hit all the right notes. Give it a fair shot and see for yourself.

Only cos they couldn't get Sean Connery! Uhura does a fan dance! That would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989 it's like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a Christmas Party.

He shows his respect for alien life forms by leaving her face down in a pool of water. Nice one! Seems Connery 2.0 was a bit of a Vulcan rebel. Which explains why Spock hasn't previously mentioned him in 79 t.v episodes and 4 movies. McCoy apparently mercy-killed his Dad, BUT AFTERWARDS THEY FOUND A CURE. Tell me this isn't hysterically funny.The 11 deck Enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. The Enterprise breaches the galactic barrier, which has mysteriously moved from the edge to the centre of the galaxy (see Where No Man Has Gone Before). Still, that's only about 50,000 light years... Shatner meets God! Or what purports to be God, but I assume is really some kind of alien being. God looks a bit like Charlton Heston in The 10 Commandments. Sean Connery MK II calls on God to share his pain, and promptly dies. Or something. God punishes the Shat for questioning his identity. So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I'd love to know what Jehovah's Witnesses made of this scene.The Shat, having killed God, promptly goes back to his sing-song with Spock and Bones. Altogether now, Row Row Row Your Boat.....

And turning Kirk into a free climbing enthusiast fit neither Kirk's character as depicted in the original series nor Shatner's rotund physique. A lot of people called this the worst Star Trek movie of them all and I was ready to believe them at the time.Having watched this again a few hours ago, I have to say this is a lot more enjoyable than I remembered, even if my original criticisms about the movie are still valid. But the film does contain a few scenes that are visually imaginative (such as the assault on Paradise City, Spock's jet boots, or the sequence around McCoy's inner pain), does feature some great acting (whatever happened to Larry Luckinbill after this?), and that it does capture that spirit of genuine excitement about going to new places and facing the unknown that used to be such an important motive in Star Trek and that is so painfully lacking from some of the later movies.As for the slapstick humor, which was not so well received originally (to say the least), I can only observe that between 1989 and now some of the Next Generation installments like Star Trek Nemesis have shown what really embarrassing humor in Star Trek movies looks like, so the moments of comic relief in The Final Frontier seem positively uproarious in comparison. Most of the jokes are character-based here, and even if some of the characters come off as a little stupid (Chekov and Sulu getting lost, Scotty bumping his head on a beam, etc.) the humor is never as unfunny as the Data jokes from the NG movies. This movie must have lost its claim to worst Star Trek movie ever a long time ago, but apparently no one took notice.But most importantly, this movie is not really so much about Sybok's quest for Sha-Ka-Ree, as it is about the Kirk-Spock-McCoy relationship and the way it is challenged by the presence of an outsider (Sybok). And that is what really makes this movie compelling, if not exactly great. Never in the original series nor in the other movies has their relationship been studied as closely and with as much heart.So it is probably a good idea not to pay too much attention to the contrived action elements of the movie like the Klingon ship and instead watch this more like a romance. All things considered, this movie, while it may not be a classic, is one of the worthier additions to the Star Trek universe.

Scotty is depicted as a bumbling tinkerer instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series. Uhura...Gods, I can't even think about what they did to her character. All of her dialog was painful to listen to. McCoy seemed like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock...well, let's just say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted. He was given bad dialog (I do not believe you have grasped the gravity of your situation Captain. Gravity, get it? Get it?) and made almost into a buffoon. Kirk...oh man, don't get me started. William Shatner is a hammy actor to begin with, so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we got.The plot is beyond ridiculous. Giving Spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap operaish. But hey, let's go with it. The search for God. Again, a weak plot basis. You don't think so? OK, let's go with that too. So assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound, what's wrong with the script? Well, for one thing, it recycles way too much. The Enterprise, for example, is yet again, not working properly. Are we to assume that Starfleet would send a grossly malfunctioning ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation? If that's the case, then why not put him on a better ship as an adviser? Adding to that...the crew is grossly incompetent. Scotty has the ship in pieces (and apparently is cloddish enough to bump his head knocking himself into unconsciousness WHILE there are hostiles on board!), no one seem to notice the Klingon ship decloaking at a crucial moment (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in weapons range) and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If this is the flagship of Starfleet, then it's a wonder that the Klingons hadn't already overthrown the Federation.As to the personal struggles with pain, it was crap. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he couldn't save this turkey. In short no one could. Of all the people involved, I imagine Leonard Nimoy is the most embarrassed by it. I hope he is, anyway.Thank god the original cast didn't bow out on this cloddish opus.

Paramount spent less on this film than they did on TMP, which doesn't sound bad until you realize that there's a 10 gap between when the films were made. The $40 TMP cost to make would be equivalent to about $75 million in 1989. This film is the reason that Shatner has never been given a fair chance to direct other films, as well. Every time he turned around, the studio was slashing the budget and making demands regarding the storyline. The fact that this was the one storyline that Roddenberry and Shatner could agree upon for the most part made the freshman directorial task tough enough, but after all the machinations were done, all anyone ended up with was an uneven story and a load of badly executed special effects not worthy of the original series, much less a major motion picture. The most glaring examples - All of the Phaser effects were severely ashed out and fake-looking. - The shot of the Enterprise going into the great barrier was so obviously a still-frame shot being zoomed away from. At least the popsicle stick that held the Enterprise cut out up was successfully matted out. - God chasing Kirk up the mountain... Egads, they may as well have just cut in shots of Godzilla climbing the volcano at the end of Godzilla 1985, and used thumbtacks to scratch the emulsion off of the film to make electric bolts come out of his eyes at the imperiled Captain Kirk....

As silly and plot hole-ridden as much of it is, it's still often fitfully enjoyable, granted you can get through the really bad opening half-hour (the crew on shore leave).  The premise, a Vulcan named Sybok who is on a quest for God at the center of the galaxy, is easily the most ambitious of all the Trek films to date.  Shatner, who directed this one, obviously aims to give us a popcorn adventure that aims to explore spirituality and faith. He doesn't particularly succeed, given that the movie raises so many questions.  How does the Enterprise make it to the center of the galaxy in a matter of hours?  Where did Sybok receive his visions?  Were they merely delusional or sent by what they found on the planet?  On my first viewing, I'd suspected he'd actually received the visions, but seeing the movie again, it's still inconclusive, which (spoiler) makes me wonder how the creature they discovered knew how to present itself and knew they were on a quest to search for Shakari.  Perhaps that in itself is a suitable explanation that the creature had been sending Sybok visions (which might also sort of explain how they managed to land on the right spot on the planet).  The lead trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy get more screentime together here than in any previous entry, and that's always a good thing considering the chemistry between these three have always been the most consistent bright spot of the series.  The highlight of the whole film is perhaps Jerry Goldsmith's marvelous score, a truly awe-inspiring piece that is able to build suspense and wonder just by listening to it alone.  Star Trek V is easily the most hated of the series (for me, the worst goes to Trek III), but aside from the beginning, it's never boring, and silly as it may be, it does have its heart in the right place and I'll give it credit for that.

The villain is also compelling and well acted, his character is acted well and has a misguided noble pursuit that you can empathize with. The lesson about fear is a good one and you get a good look into the mind of the three leads. This movie all together is not the worst Star Trek movie but it is not that good either.

Sybok's (Laurence Luckinbill) empath power taken to it's extreme was an effective device to explain how he got followers to come over to his side. The search for Sha Ka Ree beyond the Great Barrier at the Center of the Galaxy would have been made more effective however if it wasn't insinuated that God was on the other side. That whole concept fell apart as soon as Kirk asked the logical question - What does God need with a starship?

A lot of this can be laid at the doorstep of William Shatner, who makes his film directing debut with this movie and does a terrible job. But let's save a good deal of the blame for screenwriter David Loughery, whose script is pathetic. The story itself might have worked in the hands of a better director and writer. The idea that the crew goes on a mission that takes them face-to-face with a being claiming to be God has a lot of potential. Unfortunately little is done with the idea and the payoff to the whole thing is underwhelming. Sybok is a lame character limply played by Laurence Luckinbill. Considering the movie revolves around him, it's unfortunate they couldn't get a more dynamic actor for the part. Sadder still is how the character is written as a cult leader with some kind of power to sway people over to his side, yet this power is frustratingly never explained. The regular cast all play their parts as well as can be expected given the poor script. There's a lot of comedy in this one and it's hit or miss. The special effects are spotty, as well. All of this taken into account, it's easy to see why it's so hated. But I'm going to back off my complaints somewhat and say that, while it's certainly not a good film, it is still watchable. This is Star Trek with Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley, Doohan, etc. I would watch them even if it was just 90 minutes of them yelling at kids to get off their lawn and turn off their rap music.

It is a film bogged by a underdeveloped script, poor special effects and the ego of its director, William Shatner.After the events of Star Trek IV The Voyage Home the crew of the Enterprise is on shore level as Scottie (James Doohan) tries to make new Enterprise functional. But the Enterprise are called into action when a rogue Vulcan Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill) takes hostages on the planet Nimbus III from the Federation and Klingon and Romulan empires with Sybok believing he has found the origin of creation.After Star Trek IV was made Paramount was contractually obligated to let Shatner to direct the fifth Trek film and give him script approval him, leaving us a film of Captain Kirk battling God. There are decent ideas in the film, particularly that all cultures have some brief that there is a God, or a creator some sort and how would religion function in a intergalactic world? But it is was the script that was underdeveloped and many of these ideas were not fully explored. Also the whole theme about God goes against what Star Trek has been about, especially with the outright mention of God.The other little idea that was that Sybok could take away the personal pain of people , despite the fact that it our experiences that make us who we are.But there are holes in the script. The first is if the Enterprise is in such bad condition why would Starfleet send the Enterprise, just send the crew to another ship and wouldn't Spock have to tell his commanding officers of the conflict of interest.The Final Frontier has numerous problems. For a film with the serious subject matter this is a film that suffers from poor comedy that pads the film like the infamous 'Row Row Row Your Boat singing scene. There is also the infamous fan dance which raises two questions first if this was plan A to distract the guards what the hell was plan B? Second who would want to see a woman in her mid-fifties dance half naked? This also leads to the problem that many of the cast members looked too old for their roles, with Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner developing big bellies and not fit enough.The special effects looked like they had a massive step back, looking really cheap and substandard. The movements were more jerky, the lighting effects looking poor, terrible green screen and the film is even more dated then the previous entries in the series.One good attitude in the films favour is the excellent score provide by Jerry Goldsmith, a better score then the films deserves.Star Trek V The Final Frontier is a wasted opportunity which did not fulfil the potential.

A bad film with good intentions, but still a bad film.One thing that i personally liked was the character's depth in that film. It was aces, and certainly it establishes an intimacy with the characters. The focus of the film is entirely around the friendship of Kirk, Spock and McCoy, and during the first 30 minutes or so we have an idea of what the film is trying to pass. In my honest opinion this film had the best character development of all the other Installments of the Original series.I also liked the idea of Spock having a brother which is totally different from the other Vulcan's...Sibock is the opposite of Spock he uses Sensibility instead of sense, passion instead of logic... pretty interesting antithesis. This guy represents the missionary, specifically the 'Christian's missionary(implied) which, according to the film, brainwashes people. Interesting theme, but is upsetting the fact that it's not explained how he do his tricks.Then after a while, things starts to became way too nonsense. I mean, why the Klingon's captain was so crazy trying to catch Kirk? The viewer don't knows better. And the film neither explains who was the 'Fake' God in the end of the film. I understand that it tried to make the things 'subtle' and left for the viewer's imagination, but it didn't works. It lefts the viewer clueless instead, and i can understand why.The unfunny childish jokes and the outdated CGI does not help either, but i must say that I'm not bother so much with CGI if the film is old as this one. But the childish jokes definitely killed this film(a bit). Obviously there are a few funny parts, but generally they were way too forced.Watchable film, but it has too many flaws. 5.7/10 "},{"Title":"From one of the best...","Date":"14 November 2013","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Well, I loved STAR TREK IV it was just so different, so fresh, that it's my favourite of the original cast movies. Unfortunately, THE FINAL FRONTIER is everything that film isn't. It tries to get to grips with an equally heavy (or heavier) subject matter, but the resultant film is ponderous, devoid of action, dated, cheesy and, even worse, boring.The film sees Spock's long-lost brother (who he?) coming out of the woodwork and commandeering the Enterprise in search of God. Unfortunately, there's no action to speak of, and the special effects used to detail the almost magical scenario are pretty shoddy. Shatner directs as well as stars, but his direction leaves plenty to be desired.Sure, there's still fun to be had from watching the original cast going through the paces, but they really are going through the paces here and that's all they're doing. Some of them seem a little bored. The best supporting actors the movie can manage are B-movie veterans David Warner and Michael Berryman. THE FINAL FRONTIER has a philosophical tone and some of the scenes are quite sentimental - the campfire bit in particular - but you'd have to be a huge Trekkie to get much joy out of this dull instalment.

I didn't hate it, I didn't love it, and certainly after following The Voyage Home, Final Frontier felt like a massive step backwards.The whole God notion didn't really interest me much then, it seemed such a silly premise, that later we discover in the movie its not God at all is beside the point, many people were turned off from seeing the movie in the first place, because whilst many people believe in God, they probably never actually want to see God, and certainly not a silly sci- fi movies interpretation of God either.Sybok as the main villain...... turns out he's not really a villain at all, but I felt the whole 'Sybok is Spocks brother' storyline was a bit too much soap opera for me. There was never any allusion to Spock having a brother, and for it to be brought up after all this time, just felt too tacked on.Other characters were shortchanged and had virtually no character development, especially the three that were trapped on Nimbus, held captive by Sybok.The one saving grace for the entire movie though, was the camaraderie of the three main characters. I didn't really appreciate it first time around, but more so now, I found myself laughing and smiling, the interaction of Kirk, Spock and Bones at various parts really helped lift the movie, and its one of the few things that helped prevent the movie being drab and boring.The VFX are long held up as being not the best, but to be honest, with the exception of the horrible matte lines around the Enterprise when it was in front of the blue clouds of Shakaree, for the most part, I didn't really notice any problems. Certainly there are elements of Wrath of Khan with similar scenes that don't hold up so well and that was ILM in charge of effects.Final Frontier isn't a bad film, its simply an OK one, and thats really not good enough for Star Trek, and thankfully this wasn't the last movie the original crew did as this would not have been a fitting send off for them.I think they backed themselves in a corner by approaching the 'God' question which simply put a lot of people off, but there is still enough recognisable Trek in it that its not a disaster.Its such a shame that having found big success with The Voyage Home, Paramount slashed the budget on this one, because by all accounts, the original ending was supposed to be far more satisfactory.

A plot that is called ridiculous, characters that are called uninteresting and a film that is regarded as the most unnecessary addition to this franchise makes for clearly low expectations.I absolutely hate the first Star Trek movie. It was paced horrendously, the characters were extremely one dimensional and the story was not immersive. It truly was one of the worst franchise openers and I wasn't looking forward to the next ones. Gladly, the trilogy that followed was fantastic! Critics such as legend Roger Ebert have stated this is the worst of the bunch so I went in with the most horrible expectations and surprisingly, this movie shocked me in a good way! I honestly don't get the complaints given to this film. Sure, it isn't a great film but it had a story that was decent, some good characters and added a bit of depth to a few of the characters and provided a few emotional scenes. Sure, the ending to this film was unsatisfying and sure the story was ridiculous but I find this to be a guilty pleasure.The movie truly suffers with some ridiculous scenes at times such as singing 'Row, row, row your boat' and a glimpse at a romance between Scotty and Uhura but for the most part, the story was rather well done and it had a few good moments. The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel. It doesn't offer much new content apart from a scene where we discover a bit about Bones' past. That scene was well done and provided some emotional depth to his character.People say that this film isn't funny. They say the comedic level of this film is extremely low compared with the previous trilogy. I agree but the comedy still works in this film unlike in the original film. The acting was mostly good and the new characters did a good job, especially the character of Sybok, whom I particularly liked.Star Trek V The Final Frontier is one of those movies I'd take as a guilty pleasure and an unnecessary addition to the Star Trek franchise yet certainly an enjoyable and fun film. This film truly has gotten better as time passed by. Back in 1989, it was viewed ridiculous and I am a little understanding of that, but by 2013, that so called horrid mess this film was has been forgotten with some fantastic sequels to this so called atrocity.

With the title of The Final Frontier, and with the premise of a God-seeking adventure, you'd think this would be the most epic and profound Trek movie of the lot. Sadly, as of the time of this writing, it's considered the worst Trek movie of the series, and for some viewers, it might even be ranked as one of the worst movies of all time.Even I won't deny that the film has its issues. The special effects are strangely gaudy in this film, lacking in refinement or quality. The acting is at its cheesiest, with jokes and anecdotes thrown out profusely throughout the picture. Most viewers will also take issue with Sybok's character - you'll find out why about halfway through the picture - and the overall plot, which comes off as messy and directionless.The film is not without charm, however. I personally always enjoyed the comedic antics of the three main characters, especially during the opening mountain climbing scenes and during their madcap pursuits in the Enterprise's interior. Action is frequent and will be pleasing for non-discerning Trek fans.As ambitious as the story is, it runs through a rather formulaic plot, with little room for quality character development. Themes should be present, but generally aren't. It's as straightforward and simple as a Trek movie can be.This film is captured with okay, never great, photography and editing. Acting and writing in this picture is never a serious affair; the script gets the job done, but after so many revisions, it has undoubtedly lost something along the way. The cast members do the best they can with their material. Similarly, the sets, props, costumes, and special effects do their best to make the picture work, but are not without weaknesses. Music might be the biggest standout here.The fifth Star Trek film never struck me as being a terrible film, for I have found it enjoyable. However, it is a haphazardly-constructed film with issues that most viewers will find distasteful. Trek fans might want to check this out once, but for everybody else, not recommended.3.5/5 (Entertainment Good | Story Average | Film Average) "},{"Title":"I really liked this movie, is not the worst Trek.

He's the glue that hold them together, McCoy needs him to be sarcastic, Kirk gets mad at him at times, but at the end nothing would work right without him. In this movie Nimoy manages to play greatly both sides of Spock, the Vulcan and the Human, and the results are both funny and touching moments. His half-brother, Sybok, doesn't own Khan's wrath or Commander Krug's evilness, but it's an interesting and more human take of a villain. If you're just looking for phaser shots, torpedo's fire and angry Klingons, you can watch any of the other 5 ST movies (I didn't watch any TNG movies and never will) and you'll be enough pleased like I was, but here Shatner focuses more in their friendship and deepest feelings, and I like that for a change. Sure the God storyline and effects could have been way better made, but they had a lot of trouble making this movie, so I'm OK with that. For the ones saying this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made, I'll say The Motion Picture is intolerable, and the new J.J.Abrams take with awful Quinto as Spock and a twisted plot doesn't do great justice to the franchise either. 8/10 for some technical and storyline flaws, but I still liked the film as a whole.

Leonard Nimoy had a couple, and it was time for Shatner to give it a try. This film, though I personally think it's the worst of all of the Star Trek films, still is a good film for a few reasons. First of all, I believe this film explores the three leads more than any film in the whole Star Trek series does. I think people give Star Trek V a less-than-accurate review. The film is almost completely character driven. We get to see Kirk, Spock, and McCoy almost exclusively center stage. This film really explores the bond the three share. We see their fondness for each other, and finally get to explore what makes these three characters who they are. They each hold secret pain and guilt, and each deal with that pain and guilt in their own way. They are united in this aspect, and it really does drive a story-driven film along.Of course, people don't see films purely on their love for a story; they expect action and good sfx. This is without a doubt the film's Achilles heel. From the trivia section, they were forced to use a different sfx company other than ILM. Of course mix this with a small budget, and we get sub-par special effects. Roddenberry said it the best, and I paraphrase, we were under a tight budget. I think the point is to use your imagination and see what isn't there (regarding TOS). Of course that was a very rough paraphrase, but if you're a fan of ST, any of the series, you'll know that the special effects in any of them are suffering from today's standards. TNG is getting an update blu-ray set much as TOS got, and if you love these shows you know you have to use your imagination to see something that wasn't done believably at the time. If you're a person who needs action and good sfx, perhaps Star Trek V isn't for you. If you can enjoy a good story, then you can enjoy this film if you look past some of the defects. That brings along the final point; the story. It is the weakest of the whole series, beyond the fact I believe it is as strong a character film as you have in Star Trek. Just because it's the worst of a series doesn't make it terrible. It has some plot holes, some continuity errors as far as distance and space go, and really doesn't deliver what you would expect. This doesn't inspire confidence in a film, but take it from me; if you LIKE Star Trek, you will find a way to love this film, regardless of where you place it as your favorites.In the end, I feel for a Star Trek fan this one can be enjoyed thoroughly. You have conceptions of these characters that were spawned from this film. If you were trying to hook a new Trekkie by showing them this film, I think they'll have a sour idea of what Star Trek is. This film captures the essence of what Roddenberry wanted; no big wars or fights, but characters and exploration. Watch this film with an open mind. It was shot beautifully, and though it really does have many flaws, it is passable for a Star Trek film.

Unfortunately it's become law in Trekdom to pick apart this film as a turkey of astronomical proportions; consequently a sort of bandwagon phenomenon has developed amongst the cookie-cutter fundamentalist Trekkers who have somehow failed to evolve to the level of independent thought. (They're no doubt still mad at Shatner for telling them to get a life). In fact, it's become such a cliché to hate Star Trek V that it has become the Spock's Brain of the feature films (but worse).I disagree. While The Final Frontier certainly has its share of flaws -- the story goes over the edge into the realm of goofy camp at times and some argue that the F/X are possibly the least of the feature films -- it remains an entertaining picture. Besides, Star Trek was never about great special effects anyway (disregarding the triumphant The Motion Picture). Star Trek is about people, their joy of living and their grand spirit of exploration; this is what The Final Frontier is all about and it scores high marks in this regard.No other Trek film showcases the character interplay of the Kirk/Spock/McCoy troika to the level of intimacy shown in The Final Frontier, and only The Voyage Home exceeds the joyful energy of the characters displayed here. As far as the spirit of exploration goes, Star Trek V surpasses all other Trek adventures; after all, no exploration is greater than the quest for ultimate reality and the Supreme Creator. As a matter of fact, this picture touches on many important themes personal pain, healing, faith, family, love, fanaticism, the desire to know ultimate reality (absolute truth), God, false beliefs, loyalty, repentance and forgiveness. Name another film in the series that addresses so many weighty topics and yet remains entertaining.The film was actually doomed with critics and Trekker fundamentalists the moment it was disclosed that Shatner would direct it; the knives hit the sharpening stones well before it was ever released and once the buzz got out that it was a bad film a feeding frenzy ensued. It would have been better received if Shatner had directed the film anonymously and if it were released after Star Trek III. As it was, it came out on the heels of Star Trek IV, the hands-down pinnacle of the feature films. If The Wrath of Khan had come out after The Voyage Home it would have been deemed a mediocre affair.The bottom line is that Star Trek V is a solid and extremely original Trek outing, equal parts amusing, thought-provoking, wonder-inducing and heart-warming; it possesses a wealth of quality scenes and has an interesting assortment of colorful characters who unite together for the ultimate discovery. Its best character is Sybok, played excellently by Laurence Luckinbill. Sybok isn't really a villain at all, but rather a rebel Vulcan who rejects Stoicism and develops a compulsion to heal people and find ultimate knowledge. His mistake is allowing this compulsion to assume the creature beyond the Great Barrier is God, which it obviously isn't. Of course the film would have been more successful if the studio hadn't repeatedly cut the budget the closer the it came to completion, thus robbing Shatner (and us) of his original vision. As it is, the climax is serviceable, but clearly missing something.Regardless, The Final Frontier is an entertaining Trek romp, if nothing else, but thankfully it offers more. Personally, I'd pop it in any day before The Wrath of Khan (sssnnnnooooorrrreee). By all means, watch it again for the first time.GRADE B "},{"Title":"An adventurous addition to the franchise; The Final Frontier is ambitious and not without a certain guile to it even if it is ultimately a tad misconstrued.","Date":"8 June 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Ideas outweigh and over raw stone wall substance in this, the fourth Star Trek sequel from back in the day; a film with an audacious premise as well as some rather far reaching concepts, which, granted, are executed dramatically enough, but only really rear their heads during the final act - by which time, both expansive theological notions and ideas have been toyed with but not really delved into to that of a level beyond what is simply pulpy material with philosophy qualifications. It is a notion encapsulated by the film's final shot; a slow, longing tilt upwards to a encompass a starry nighttime sky as the camera, indeed the film's creators, look on into the unknown and continue to dream of what might be. The shot suggests a piece still wondering; still thinking; still chewing &#x96; as if different approaches, resolutions and ideas on the same subject matter might exist somewhere else and are actually a tad better or more interesting. One hates to evoke the name of a certain film and its creator in situations such as these, but there is a reason Kubrick's 1968 film 2001 A Space Odyssey didn't hobble along through space with wild ideas and content before rounding everything off and ending with a composition that screams at us Outer space and theology, man! Like, whoa....... Of course all of this makes it sound as if I didn't at all enjoy Star Trek The Final Frontier; on the contrary, it is a good, clean crack that happens to think it's a lot better than it actually is, but is good fun in its getting to the far-flung places that it ends up, coming complete with some tension and a sense of adventure in the process &#x96; precisely the things, you might say, we ask for in a film whose title is effectively 'Star Trek V'. After the previous entry, 1986's The Voyage Home, in which the Star Trek crew, to my knowledge, ventured as far back as they had previously gone in journeying to late twentieth Century Earth, comes the entry all about the venturing forward as far as has previously happened. Again, this is a veering into the unknown that with it comes danger and exposure to realms well beyond the crew's previous experiences, making for excitement and risk. Before any of most things, we meet the crew of the USS Enterprise on an Earth-set vacation in the mid-west. Captain Kirk, played by the man doubling up as the director for this particular entry in William Shatner, is rock climbing without much in the way of safety gear and has made it a fair way up a steep mountain, toying with death in this sense but with every bit of confidence in his ability to negate the elements and work around what will be a horrible fate if things goes wrong. The usual suspects are around, his rapport with crew-mates Spock (Nimoy) and the ship's doctor, McCoy (Kelley), as free and as easy as it's ever been &#x96; there is something infectious about what they share in their ties that echo that of the confidence the producers have in appearing to create the entries to this somewhat likable franchise that have room to manoeuvre. Many miles away exists a rouge Vulcan, usually a peaceful and insightful race but here rather interestingly placed at the forefront as the source of villainy, named Sybok (Luckinbill); an intelligent being going about recruiting various folk by way of enhanced hallucinations with his philosophical musings and theological natterings whilst promising them of physical meetings with God. Our first perception of him is that of a threat, the riding horseback towards both us and an unsuspecting extra whom promptly goes to defend himself an ominous beginning. No need, Sybok is friendly and talks of confronting one's fears and opening one's mind; this initial construction running in binary opposition to that of whom Sybok believes in and continuously speaks of, as a being whose presence you cannot get to soon enough before things take their own respective turn in that department. Events take a turn; Sybok goes a little too far and before you know it, the Enterpirse crew are being scrambled to intercept him for certain reasons. Overhanging things in the background is a Kilgon ship captain named Klaa (Bryant), somebody desiring some warfare against another captain and observes the Enterprise making its moves before hitting on the notion that chasing and blasting our admiral Kirk will be as easy, but more pleasurably, as destroying space junk all day. For the most part, the film is an effective and involving enough science fiction drama feeding off of an element of conflict, or threat, from that of an individual; but an individual whose chief sources of antagonism are that of words and beliefs more-so physical acts of aggression, in spite of Klaa's presence in the film. Despite the film's far reaching notions, its core idea or catalyst for its premise is surprisingly simplistic; reading something along the lines of Can a spaceship capable of taking man the deepest into space as is possible reach the afterlife? &#x96; a thesis whose testing of which requires a fairly careful approach, not to mention somebody at the helm really in tune with their craft and with the confidence in their ability that exploring said notion will see the film home. The film works in odd shifts; we enjoy Sybok's free thinking and insightful nature going up against the Enterprise's uniformed, regimental and methodical existence and we gradually become as enthused about Sybok's idea as both he and his followers are as we near the film's final act. Where not as good as other entries, The Final Frontier holds its own as a one way space adventure involving chase; conflict and creative ideas to do with what lurks out there that only hobbles along, but does a job.

(I think I just answered my own question about William Shatner being drunk when he made this.) I'm trying to imagine what that would do to Spock's digestive system. Explosive combination indeed! Well, we see a bitchy Vulcan, we see an emotional, religious fanatic Vulcan, why not a drunk one? I think 2,3, and 4 are the best. 1 isn't too bad, and I haven't seen any past this one. Can't quite get the nerve up. 5 stars out of 10 for this one, and that's probably being generous.

It's hard to dispute that fact because the figures don't lie. The real argument begins when Star Trek fans discuss the artistic merit of the film. Most dismiss it altogether as a William Shatner ego trip with bad special effects and a poor ending.OK, let's get all of that out of the way. The special effects could have been better (i've seen worse). ILM, which created the effects for Star Treks II-IV were busy or unavailable and the producers turned to another company. The effects would've been OK for TV, but on screen they came off pretty cheesy. The saga of how Shatner lost the budget to create the ending he envisioned for his film is legendary. The final product looked rushed because it was rushed. Finally, Shatner as director was probably as restrained as you could hope for. The supporting cast really shined. Watch.With that out of the way, let's talk about five reasons you should reconsider Star Trek V The Final Frontier. The acting. I would stack the acting of this movie against any of the Kirk-Spock-McCoy era. Check out the scenes when Vulcan renegade Sybok forces Spock and McCoy to face their pain. Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly are given the ability to really act here and the payoff is some truly emotional scenes. Honestly, they are great to watch.The humor. Talk to any fan who dislikes the movie, and they will cite the scene where Scotty bumps his head as being the low point of the Star Trek movies. Fair enough. But that scene is no more forced than any of the humor in the beloved Star Trek IV The Voyage Home. To me, most of the gags in that film were forced and seem stale with repeated viewings. The humor in Star Trek V is fast and furious and takes advantage of these characters that we love.The Kirk-Spock-McCoy trio. Have these characters ever been better? Seeing them sit around a camp fire, discussing family, friends, life and death is great. It's funny, poignant and really takes advantage of the history these characters (and actors) share. How else could Spock react to the campfire song Row, row, row your boat, other than to try and disseminate the lyrics? Captain... life IS NOT a dream. Seeing that line pay off in the climax is brilliant.The Pace Star Trek V is a fast-paced, rollicking adventure that only slows down when it needs to. It may make you cringed at times ... but it's never dull.Its place in Star Trek history. There will never be another Star Trek film with the classic crew. As one of only six that were made, we should relish this film and the many good things about it. Klingons, renegade Vulcans, Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic score, Spock and McCoy arguing, Scotty fighting with the transporters, Starfleet rescue parties on horseback, Vulcan nerve pinches, phasers blasting, creatures pretending to be the almighty, great barriers, warp-speed escapes, birds of prey, mind melds and Kirk proclaiming that he fears nothing. You give me this movie any day over the lacking Generations, pointless Insurrection & awful Nemesis.First Contact is the only TNG concept that was ever worthy of getting the big screen treatment.

This was the least entertaining of the six movies that had the original crew, but this movie is still very entertaining.  In this movie Sybok is obsessed with finding god.  He goes on a quest to find him on yet another mythical planet (they have had many &#145;mythical planets') and this involves the Starship Enterprise.Part of the problem with this film is William Shatner directed it.  He is not very good in this movie as a director. He is too scattershot and the movie does not have a real focus like the other ones.  The performances are still top notch, and the spirit of Star Trek is still captured in this film, but it could have been so much better overall.This was intended to be the final Star Trek film.  But after the lackluster quality of this film Gene Roddenbery said this couldn't be the last Star Trek, and he decided to make Star Trek 6  The Undiscovered country.  The problem is with this movie parts of it are so awkward, and extremely corny.  And I don't think it is part of Star Trek's myth to have just one planet that is the SPOILER  basis for all religion in the universe.  That just seemed so strange, and it made for a pretty bad story overall, actually not a bad story, just one that really wasn&#145;t up to the quality of the original stories..Overall this is fun to watch, the complete lack of grandeur this one does not have that every Star Trek before had is pretty off-putting.  The ending is so anti-climactic.  You kind of feel after this movie the crew did not really accomplish anything.  At the end Kirk and Spock, not to mention McCoy really had done nothing, they were in the exact same position at the end of the movie as they were at the beginning of the movie, which makes one wonder why have the movie in the first place?  Despite this the movie overall is enjoyable, but if you are looking for a great Star Trek, look for 4 or 6.

There were a lot of scenes that looked like scenes from other movies.I actually think the story is better than Star Trek 4. As much as I like 4 the idea of going into the past to get whales to speak to aliens is clearly stupid and unlikely even for science fiction.

Star Trek 5 does less with its better story about a powerful being imprisoned and pretending to be god.It has to be said Bill's directing is shaky but there are some good performances to be had especially David Warner who was very believable in his role.

Shatner's original story was epic in scope and concept, and I think a good amount of it winds up on the screen.  The off-camera problems, however, drag this film down to mere-average standards.  The injection of humor gets old and stale after a while, even with a few good bits in there, and the ending is a bit of a letdown after all the buildup.  Of course, the effects are not really up to snuff, either, which also doesn't help the ending.  And whomever wrote the Uhura fan dance sequence needs to be forced to watch that sequence until their eyes bleed.But there is a lot of subtle good hiding amongst the more obvious bad.  The interplay and relationship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy is delightful to watch, even if a bit neutered from Shatner's original vision.  The campfire scenes, especially, I feel have been unfairly slammed over the years.  I remember seeing the trailer for this film when I was a child, and getting the impression from the title as well as the story conceit, that this was to be the last film, the true FINAL Frontier.  Examined in this light, the campfire scenes are warm and touching tributes to the characters who's adventures we have followed for so long.  Its an utterly humanistic touch which helps hammer home the point that a lot of us have known all along -- that ST has always been more about the people than anything else. Sybok is complex and robust villain, worthy of the best of the original series.  He's not motivated sheerly by revenge or malice, like it seems all of the villains in the TNG films are, but instead is filled with faith about the righteousness of his cause.  This lends him to be a much more interesting and magnetic character than countless other bloodthirsty bad guys.  Shatner's direction is not nearly as poor as a lot of people like to think; his work is nothing spectacular but clever shots abound -- the prologue, Sybok taking the pain of McCoy and Spock, and even the Enterprise-shuttle-BOP interaction (despite the subpar effects).I enjoyed watching this film, much more than I thought I would.  Its not perfect, or even great, but I found it to be a diverting way to spend an evening, especially if you are a Trek fan.  It may not make you question your place in the cosmic order, nor will it ever top Khan or TMP, but its still an enjoyable romp for Kirk and company.

Uh, I don't THINK so!), the bogus technology (Spock's infamous rocket boots, capable of operating upside down), the obvious continuity goofs (the Enterprise elevator shaft, with the floor markings out of sequence), and the introduction of an older brother for Spock, the laughing Vulcan Sybok (who looks younger than Spock, by the way...). It's failure confirmed the 'odd and even' theory about 'Star Trek' films (the even numbered films were considered the superior ones...at least until STAR TREK NEMESIS reared it's mediocre head), ended William Shatner's career as a film director, after only one movie, and pushed Paramount into bringing back director Nicholas Meyer, to salvage the franchise with STAR TREK VI.All this having been said, let me defend William Shatner, who took the brunt of the bad press over STAR TREK V. He had been promised the directing assignment for the film as part of his contract for STAR TREK IV (Leonard Nimoy had helmed both STAR TREK III and IV, and Shatner, who had directed for both stage and TV, wanted the same opportunity, which was certainly deserved). He had worked on the script for nearly two years, making it a profound statement about the nature of Man to challenge himself to achieve seemingly impossible goals...a theme he felt appropriate as a follow-up to the comic THE VOYAGE HOME. Religious zealots were a topical issue (then, as now), and the sweeping adventure he envisioned would involve thousands of extras riding unicorn-type horses, a quest to the 'Center of the Universe' that would, ultimately, become a descent into a 'Hell' of flame-spitting rock men, and a series of revelations that would result in a deeper bonding of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy than had been portrayed on TV or the previous four films.Then everything began to unravel. Despite the world-wide success of STAR TREK IV, Paramount gave Shatner and producer/co-writer Harve Bennett virtually the same budget as the previous film, despite the fact that STAR TREK V would require far more FX and location shooting. The studio then took issue with the theme, protesting that a film about looking for God would turn off theater-goers, and anger church groups. They demanded far more comedy in the script. They limited the production time severely, almost daring Shatner to complete the film on schedule.The FX firm hired to create the many effects shots proved to be slow and the product they produced looked 'cheap'. The thousands of extras were reduced to a handful, making the threat of Sybok appear far less menacing to the Federation. The entire interior of the Enterprise had to be rebuilt, as the studio had torn the previous sets down. The script was rewritten, emphasizing that the entity found was NOT God, and adding the continuity-challenging comic elements that the studio demanded. The schedule became so tight that reshooting was nearly impossible, and continuity glitches had to remain in the finished film.It was a situation that would have been daunting to even a veteran director, but Shatner, to his credit, kept a positive attitude, and never let the pressure he was under affect the atmosphere on set. With one daughter acting in the film, and another, on the set writing a book about the making of the film, he felt a strong sense of 'family', and this carried through to his Enterprise cast mates, as well. The scenes between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are warmer and more intimate than in any of the other TREK films featuring the original cast.While STAR TREK V is, arguably, the weakest of all the films in the franchise, the finished product should not be held against William Shatner. If there is a villain, it is Paramount, who had so little respect for STAR TREK and it's fans, that it assumed audiences would 'buy' anything with the title.This narrow thinking would reappear, sadly, with STAR TREKINSURRECTION, and STAR TREKNEMESIS. If the franchise is dead, the studio only has itself to blame.

Circumstances got in the road of all the wonderful eye candy that we could have had in this film.  Does the lack of great effects detract from the story?  Look to TOS for your answer.I also have to laugh at all the nitpicking.  Who actually cares if the big three rocket past deck 89 (whichever) twice?

This probably accounts for the non explanation for the whole Marsh Melon joke, and some more character dialogue that we could have done with.  Also, the only clunky bit of humour in the entire film is Scotty's head bashing incident.

In retrospect, maybe Nimoy was unwise to suggest this, because Shatner's end result, STAR TREK V THE FINAL FRONTIER, ended up being a weak point in the film series and a major disappointment for Shatner, who had big hopes for the film and wound up not being able to realize any of them.What went wrong? Well, Shatner's plan was to make a moody, gritty TREK film that dealt with the subject of faith, including a harrowing encounter with the Devil at the end. Paramount wanted V to be a lighthearted comedy in the vein of STAR TREK IV, and insisted that the final showdown be against an evil alien pretending to be God for its own gain. Shatner was forced to concede this in order to make the film (which he believes was his worst mistake on the film). Shatner wanted novelist Eric Van Lustbader to write the story treatments and TREK veteran Nicholas Meyer to handle the screenplay. Lustbader had a falling-out with Paramount and Meyer wasn't available, so writer David Loughery was hired by producer Harve Bennett to make the film into the comedy Paramount wanted. Shatner wanted Sybok's influence to result in a major falling-out between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Nimoy and DeForest Kelley thought it wouldn't make sense given the events of III, so that idea was scrapped early on. Shatner wanted big, epic visuals for the film. Paramount kept the $31 million budget so stiff that Shatner lost much of what he'd been planning. Shatner wanted ILM to return to the series, but they were caught up with other projects and couldn't provide their best people to work on the film. Bran Ferren, the replacement FX outfit, dazzled Paramount with stunning test footage but dropped the ball when it came to the film's actual FX work. Throw in a Writer's Guild strike that positioned V against BATMAN at the box office and numerous production problems, and it's easy to see why V didn't turn out as Shatner had hoped.So what exactly is wrong with the final film? Inconsistent pacing, for one thing. There are moments where the film moves swiftly and moments where it just DRAGS. Terrible cinematography by Andrew Laszlo; the film looks more washed-out and flat than even ST TMP. Even worse, Laszlo seems to have no sense of scope; his photography is pedestrian and devoid of any epic quality. (STAR TREK II DP Gayne Rescher would have been a much better fit for this outing.) Lousy costumes for the Starfleet away team; those brown and beige jumpsuits combined with Laszlo's bland camerawork again echo ST TMP's glum visuals. The studio-mandated evil God-alien ending is extremely anti-climactic and hokey; it completely undermines the whole trip we've been on, especially since this alien impostor can be killed by Klingon phasers. (Shatner's battle with the Devil ending would have been much more satisfying.) Shatner's direction is wildly uneven; he succeeds greatly during the quieter moments but stumbles when it comes to the action scenes. The Paradise City street fight is very badly staged, relying too much on close-ups than on showing the action in full and plagued by choppy editing and stiff choreography. Half the time, Shatner directs like a scared rabbit (which, given his well-documented discomfort over how the film was turning out, isn't surprising). And of course, the FX work is underwhelming. While Bran Ferren delivers excellent phaser and transporter FX, everything else falls short. The God effect looks like a face layered over a floodlight. The photon torpedoes look cartoony. The bluescreen shots look fake. And the warp speed FX look like they just took normal shots of the Enterprise and stuck colored lines behind it. (Isn't the ship supposed to become a blur when it takes off?) And finally, the film's tone is a little too jokey for its spiritual subject matter; Loughery's script doesn't balance the humor and drama properly. The running marsh melons gag and the turboshaft flight are more irritating than funny.The film is not without merit, though. Again, Shatner does a fine job directing the film's quieter moments. The scenes where Kirk, Spock, and McCoy discuss family and friends are truly engaging. The supporting cast gets their moments to shine, too. (Call me crazy, but I thought Uhura's desert dance was hilarious.) There's a flirtation between Scotty and Uhura that has a playful zest. Sulu and Chekov get into the thick of the action and have a funny moment where they get lost on a hike. Some of the scenery is really stunning, especially the Yosemite scenes. The acting for the most part is very good, with Laurence Luckinbill's Sybok being the standout. Jerry Goldsmith's music is, as always, gorgeous-nobody scores STAR TREK better. And as flawed as it is, the film is true to the spirit of TREK in that it tries to explore the human condition. It tries to explore the concept of faith and man's desire to believe, and even though it doesn't reach its ambitions, its heart is in the right place. Had Shatner not been so heavily compromised, the film might have met its goals. As it stands, there's a good movie somewhere in V, but it's muffled under a lot of detritus.Since Shatner wasn't happy with how the film turned out, and since the FX work is so bad, I highly recommend that he re-edit the film and re-do all the FX work for the director's edition, as Robert Wise did on ST TMP. It wouldn't make the film perfect, but it would go a long way toward improving it and getting more of the intended impact across.

Clearly the success of STIV as a light-hearted adventure lulled the writers of STV into a false sense of security. It seems that the writers were so high on the successful use of humor in IV that they went into humor-overkill mode in STV.Putting the classic cast in very human situations to create laughter is one thing, but writing bad dialogue is another. While the potential was clearly there to make a very thoughtful ST movie, the potential was squandered with a piss poor screenplay. The dialogue in ST5 is arguably the worst in any of the Trek films.I've read here that because Shatner is a poor actor that they should've never let him direct. Let's forget that Shatner is an underrated actor, especially when he restrains himself (ala ST3) for a minute. If being a bad actor means you'll be a bad director, then based on that brilliant observation, Quentin Tarantino should've never stepped behind the camera.Shatner has gone to write the Tek War series and a few memoirs, and I have found them all to be entertaining and have solid writing. But in the case of ST5, the writing, (which wasn't all Shatner's fault if you look at the credits), prevented the movie from reaching the status of Star Trek 2-4.However, there is still much to admire about Star Trek V. As it has often been written and I paraphrase, Shatner chose some of the boldest material to work with despite being warned against it. According to Shatner, he had all these cool ideas for the movie, especially the ending, which just didn't come to fruition because of budget cuts. That they didn't have ILM to do the special f/x didn't help the movie any.The movie is very physical for the characters, which is good. And despite its poor dialogue and some groan-inducing humor, ST5 still tells a wonderful story that is very human when it comes to friendships and personal beliefs. Because of that, I don't consider this the worst Trek film. I leave that designation to the cliched and utterly predictable Insurrection, and the poorly thought out Generations.

The first forty-five minutes or so of the film are truly bad, badly acted and written, and the jokes are terrible.  Then, the actual story kicks in....From that point on, the battle between the Enterprise crew and a seemingly fanatical hijacker picks up both momentum and emotional steam, aided in no little respect by the wonderful performance of Laurence Luckinbill.  Likewise, after the first forty-five minutes or so, the regulars act like they're in a different film from that which they'd been previously occupying.

I never understood who started the rumor that this was going to be a bad movie.Make no mistake, THIS IS THE BEST STAR TREK MOVIE EVER! Actually, to me this is the ONLY Star TREK movie ever made to the big screens.This was the first time I felt I was watching STAR TREK at the cinema. William Shatner did a great job in capturing the atmosphere of the original 60´s series. Something than the other directors never achieved before.Not even Leonard Nimoy did it. His movies were among the best, but they were always missing something, that to this day I still don´t know what it is, but it´s present in William Shatner´s STAR TREK V. I know this sounds a bit abstract, but if you loved the originals as much as I do maybe you felt the same too.Even the original bridge blips and noises were present this time, making this new Enterprise really feel like the original one. And the production designers really tried to capture the original feeling of the Enterprise and at the same time adding this new modern look. Something that was never accomplished in the other films, where the sets had always something missing in the design, making them look more unrealistic and plastic than this new ones, which by the way are also brilliantly lit and have an excellent classic atmosphere.But one of the great things that set this ST movie apart from the others is that we can see that it was directed with a personal style by William Shatner, something that is never present on the other ST movies, because all look the same and could be directed by any director and we never would find out each one did it. Not with STAR TREK V. This movie has a personal style. And a very good one. I think William Shatner should do a few more movies, because this one really looks different from the usual Hollywood production. Maybe it was because of this that it was destroyed.Ok, the special effects could have been better and the ending of the story could have been magnificent, instead of that almost disappointment, but I read somewhere that the makers, had to cut lots of things they had written for the finale, because they had not much money to film it. It seems that this was the cheapest STAR TREK movie ever. Aparently someone didn´t trust Wiliam Shatner to direct this thing. What a mistake, because I bet if he had been given the money, I´m sure this movie would have been amazing.Anyway, despite everything, this is an excellent STAR TREK movie, and the only one who really feels like STAR TREK. So don´t be afraid of watching this, because even the story is good, and they did an excellent job with the material they were allowed to write despite the lack of money for this production.Once again ,we here in Europe have the contrary opinion to the Americans. Practicaly the only reviewers who didn´t liked the film, were the ones who hate Star Trek and sci-fi. Everybody else gave it high marks considering him the most acurate STAR TREK movie to date.And I totally agree. Not a masterpiece, but a fantastic movie despite his flaws. 9 out of 10. Don´t miss it.

But as it turned out, Shatner's writing and directing skills were not up to par with Nimoy's!This movie does plenty wrong and many thought that the series should had ended here. Star Trek had outlived its course and they had obvious difficulties coming up with new stuff to do and keep things up to date with the standards of filmmaking and science-fiction. It perhaps also was no coincidence that the television series Star Trek The Next Generation, with an all new cast, got launched in 1987, 2 years prior to this movie and 1 year after the previous Star Trek movie entry. You know Star Trek is in trouble when it is starting to take on Star Wars sound effects and tries to mimic Star Wars like sequences. Isn't that like crossing the streams?Thing they came up with for this movie; a search for God. Really doesn't sound like the most spectacular thing and it also really isn't. But what's perhaps even more disappointing is that the movie never goes deep. You would expect for a movie with a subject like that to bring up 2 or 3 interesting and provoking questions about life and religion but the movie really never does. It instead seemed like it was more focused on its comedy! And it's really not the funny sort of comedy but more of the awkward kind. It's very random, silly and often just completely out of place and tone with the rest of the movie. Because of this, there also is never really any sense of danger throughout the movie, which is taking away pretty much all of the excitement and entertainment out of it.Not that the movie is boring. I mean, in all honesty, it's just as good/bad to watch as any other random science-fiction flick, that involves traveling through space and visiting alien planets. I can still see why this movie is disliked by many, of which most are hardened Star Trek fans. This is pretty much the Star Trek movie in which stuff got made fun of and things turned silly. It also made it obvious how outdated the franchise was getting and how old the cast suddenly turned.All of the cast members were really starting to look too old for their roles. Nothing wrong with having 2 or 3 wrinkly characters walking around but when it's being a whole starship, that is just being a bit too much. And really, this is of course something they easily could had prevented by introducing new characters and letting them slowly and subtly take over the main parts but somehow I think Shatner opposed to this idea and maybe is also a reason why he demanded full control and directed this movie himself.It's also true that this movie really could had used a good main villain. Sybok really isn't an evil character at heart and certainly does nothing horrible and while there are some Klingons walking around in this movie, their roles are being pretty limited unfortunately.In all honesty, it's far from a terrible movie and I certainly still consider it to be a watchable one but it just isn't the most interesting, original, entertaining or clever of Star Trek movies out there.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"I Actually Liked This Movie","Date":"20 March 2010","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I really did.

Oh, what a marvelous disaster! From Shatner's book, Star Trek Movie Memories, we read about Shatner's grandiloquent vision for the greatest TREK adventure of all - the search for God Itself! The Final Frontier! We learn of the hordes of barbarians at the gate, of the ten Rock Men finale; of the sweeping alien farscapes and cerebral pondering on the existence of God... and then we run aground on the studio complaints, crews being late, loss of light, story changes, budget constrictions, time delays, the middle-background whining of Gene Roddenberry and how hard it is to direct and - we end up with STAR TREK V THE FINAL FRONTIER. A marvelous disaster.A Vulcan named Sybok pirates the Enterprise in a misguided quest for Sha Ka Ree - the abode of God, which is apparently somewhere in the middle of the galaxy, a vantage point from which (we surmise) all prayers and oblations can be heard and dealt with in timely fashion.Sybok hypnotizes Kirk's crew to go along for his ride by healing their inner demons - an easy task with the extras known as Cast Regulars, Sulu, Uhura and Chekov (Takei, Nichols and Koenig); not so easy when it comes to Scotty (James Doohan, skulking about the bilges of the reconditioned, malfunctioning Enterprise NCC-1701-A) and The New Three Stooges, Moe Kirk, Larry Spock and Curly Bones McCoy (Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley).I'll say one thing for Shatner (who also co-wrote with Harve Bennett and David Loughery) he intimately knows which TREK characters work and how to work them, as Kirk, Spock and Bones are holding hands in almost every scene. As with all STAR TREKs, the humorous and impassioned scenes involving The Three are tempered by the ridiculous - Uhura getting the attention of some desert dwellers by doing a nude feather dance (which is not only embarrassing, considering she thinks to tempt them with her 70-year-old, wrinkly ta-tas, it's kinda icky as well), or another cantina sequence (after the failed attempt in TREK III), where they once again display their utter inferiority to STAR WARS.A disturbing scene shows McCoy euthanizing his father on his deathbed, Sybok coaxing the memory from McCoy to absolve his pain with catharsis; Spock is shown his birth and subsequent spurning by his father as being too human. These scenes are the heart of darkness Shatner was aiming for.Unfortunately, couched within STAR TREK, before too long we are bound to slam into something idiotic, such as Sybok giving an uneducated monologue to justify his quest, People thought the world was flat - but Columbus proved it wasn't! (shows how much he knows about Earth history - Columbus was establishing a trade route, not proving the Earth's sphericity); People thought the sound barrier couldn't be broken - it was! (and this time, when he could cite the man who actually attempted and succeeded in that singular quest, Sybok doesn't - Chuck Yeager, you Vulcan C-Student!).For every dramatic hammer (like Kirk affirming, I know who I am! I don't need to confront my pain!) there is a nail in the coffin (like Kirk fighting a three-breasted cat-lady...).The hammer With the Enterprise, Sybok intends to breach The Great Barrier - a wall of special effects that no one can pass through alive. The nail Apparently, all it takes to breach the Great Barrier safely... is to fly through it.The hammer The most authentic Klingons yet in the series pursue Kirk for the glory of killing him, chok-tha-ing quite fluently in what was established as actual Klingon dialect, created by linguist Marc Okrand. The nail Uh, why do you need a PERISCOPE on a space ship? Spock gets to nerve pinch a horse, Chekov gets to sit in the Captain's seat; Shatner's real life daughter is on-board as an Ensign and she's as bad an actor as the rest of the extras; Uhura and Scotty are an item - but if I wanted to see something that weird, I'd watch the cantina sequence at Mos Eisley.After numerous annoying plot holes and cinematic deficiencies, Sybok and The Three shuttle down to the planet of Sha Ka Ree to meet God. And we get the perfunctory evil alien with laser beams shooting out of his eyes.The final scene is a funny, touching moment as Kirk is overjoyed to see Spock on-board a Bird of Prey and is about to hug him, when Spock interjects, Please, Captain, not in front of the Klingons. Many argue that STAR TREK movies must be judged in the time period they were made - an apologist remark usually pertaining to the low budget efx that every TREK up to V is victim of. But that is not why the TREK movies are such phenomenal space junk. We can live with dated effects; what drives us insane are the egregious non-performances from every single supporting cast member and absolutely illogical and unscientific plot points, bad editing, poor direction, a general sloppiness and an overwhelming plastic dynamic.The final frontier will be when STAR TREK steps out from behind Gene Roddenberry's skirts to proclaim it is part of our universe, to join the movie-making community on equal grounds, to boldly go where every other filmmaker has gone before - film school.

The first few films were quite serious and I don't think they could have continued in the same way so with The Voyage Home they lightened up a bit and added more humour, with this film they wanted to balance it a bit more making it a bit more serious but still having moments of humour. I think it worked pretty well, also I found the sense of comradeship between Kirk, Spock and Bones genuinely moving. I wouldn't say I was ever a huge Star Trek fan but now having watched half the films so far I think I may be becoming one.

(That award easily goes to Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan.) It was not the worst Star Trek movie, however. To me, that was a movie that I have not seen mentioned here very often Star Trek Generations. (Star Trek The Motion Picture and Star Trek The Voyage Home are, for very different reasons, close behind in the contest for the worst movie.) There are some episodes of the original series which make any one of the movies seem like Citizen Kane in comparison, however And the Children Shall Lead, Spock's Brain, and The Way to Eden. You thought Shatner's singing was bad in The Final Frontier? Listen to Charles Napier in The Way to Eden! Spock's Brain probably has the worst plot of any Star Trek episode and remains watchable only because it is occasionally (and unintentionally) hilarious. And the Children Shall Lead is really the worst episode because the acting is terrible. Don't be so hard on The Final Frontier and William Shatner.

The relationship between the three principles is reminiscent of the television series. As a matter of fact this movie depicts the Kirk, Spock and McCoy relationship better than any other Trek film. From the escape from the brig to the campfire scene, there are many great moments with these three characters. At one point Kirk is about to hug Mr. Spock when Spock stops him saying, Captain, not in front of the Klingons. What could be better than the three friends singing Row, Row, Row Your Boat. In the campfire scene, McCoy spikes the beans with whiskey while Kirk contemplates Vulcan gas. This movie, director by William Shatner has been panned by critics and fans alike; however, they have missed the point. This film is closer in spirit to the 60's series than any of the other Star Trek movies. Totally enjoyable.

Some of them are considered serious (a.o. the number of decks and how the Enterprise was able to reach the center of the Galaxy going at Warp 7) but as I said, don't care about them. The acting is great for a Star Trek movie. William Shatner is as stiff as always, but I like that. Nimoy is good, but the real gems are James Doohan (as Scott, who else?) and Laurence Luckinbill (as Spock's half-brother Sybok). Luckinbill is very convincing and sincere and seemed to have good fun. The visual effects are at times horrendous, with that budget (nearly 28 million dollars) why didn't they use ILM instead of Associates and Ferren. Yes, ILM was producing the f/x for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, but did ALL the staff at ILM do so?

Star Trek V The Final Frontier is such a drastic plummet from the quality of the previous films that one wonders what happened.  Everything from screenplay, visual effects, editing, and story have all seemed to lose several points in this film, and the end result ends up feeling disjointed and apocryphal in relation to the continuity of the series.  The story deals with tremendous metaphysical questions in the same way a troubled twelve year old would, and moments that could have had great power come across as if they were directed by a person who has a resume composed entirely of beer commercials.  Many of the movie's sequences are obviously pandering to the ego of William Shatner, Star Trek V's director, writer and star.  The brightest point of the entire film is the villain Sybok, played by Laurence Luckinbill.  Luckinbill lends a degree of dignity to the material that it does not deserve, and is the only person throughout the film that seems to have half of his brain capacity functioning.Star Trek V seems to want to tap into the nostalgia of its fan base, but does so with over-long and pointless scenes of Kirk, Spock and McCoy singing around a campfire.  While the first film failed to make the characters paramount, Star Trek V gives the audience WAY to much of the character moments, sacrificing a decent and logical story and ignoring aspects of the previous films.  Star Trek V The Final Frontier is the lowest point in the entire franchise, making it a necessity for the original crew to return for one more adventure.

Did they explain this and I just missed it or what?My second problem is that you find out that this being is claiming to be God and then turns out not to be.  Ok...so who is he?  They don't even attempt to explain that at all!My next problem is the comedy in this film is just terrible.  There are a few good ones, but they are few and far between.  When Scotty says that he knows the ship like the back of his hand and runs face-first into the metal support beam thing was so retarded!  Oh ha-ha, we've never heard that one before...

THE TITLE Trivialized by what's already a pop-culture catch phrase.  A cop out.2. YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY This movie was beat from the start.  A victim of  TREK's revived popularity. In 1989 you had the 'classic' fans, the KHAN generation,  civilians won over by THE VOYAGE HOME, and NEXT GENERATION fans.   Expectations crossed the board.   Making matters worse, the writers had a clean slate,  resulting in a muddled original story.  The answer should have been  incorporating some TREK history and acknowledging the NEXT GENERATION. Instead, we got tangents.  Like Spock's brother.3. SPECIAL EFFECTS How could one of the strongest movie franchises in town let this happen? Fans should petition to get Nick Myer to do a STAR WARS style Special Edition.4.  THE FALL From Kirk's foot slip to I expect that's Klingon for 'hello'  this movie holds some of the most embarrassing moments in Star Trek.  I remember the butterflies in my stomach as Spock dives into this dumb scene with FX from Saturday morning.  The Nimbus bar (office for the delegates?) is a lame copy of the STAR WARS cantina.5.  DEFECTIVE ENTERPRISE This crew works at a disadvantage in every film but UNDISCOVERED......even GENERATIONS.  The broken ship is a tired device, and here it doesn't make sense. There's no relevance to the plot, except maybe the broken transporter. Other functions are played only for 'laughs'.6.  SUPPORTING CAST WASTED Sulu and Chekov lost! --hilarious! Uhura stripping!! --A riot!!  Scotty bangs his head! ...okay, that was actually pretty funny.  The director was not responsible for most trouble,  but he has no idea how to treat these characters.  Not realizing their value, he plays them either goofy or hypnotized.  A missed opportunity for drama in exposing their pain or portraying the forced betrayal of Kirk.  Remember Chekov's struggle in 'KHAN'.7.  KLINGONS Used only as a conflict device, they have no motivation given except to 'get Kirk'.  There could have been an effort to rescue Korrd or even direct orders from the Klingons to use the conflict as an excuse to entrap Kirk. (like UNDISCOVERED...)  I did like the use of Klingonese but if you follow closely, there's a Klingon word for Kalicams... which IS a Klingon word...8.  THE HANGER DECK The design department has no concept of perspective.  The look was great but the proportions are way off.  This contributes to a feeling that something is not right.  A well acted scene has the effect of a school play.  I was drawing technical plans for this stuff when I was 10!!  How could they be so far off.9.  I WANT JIM KIRK! The Admiral's reason for sending the undermanned Enterprise.  Why??  With Klingons involved, it means trouble.  Are we to believe the average Starship captain is THAT unprepared for this situation.  It would have made more sense if  Enterprise were the ONLY option.10.  SYBOK'S TAKEOVER Controlling the bridge, Sybok takes over.  Where is everybody? And why do crewmembers stand passively, listening to his message.  He relieved everyone's pain?  From here on, the story moves around the characters.  Scotty tries to animate things... until he's knocked out.11.  SPOCK'S BROTHER I'll accept that he has a half-brother we don't know about.  Sybok isn't the type of guy Spock would discuss.  But it's such an obvious device from which to squeeze drama.  Ooooh, conflict...HOW will Spock resolve this one.  The film suffers from too many plot contrivances for us to accept this on too.  No matter how good these two actors are.  (And they are good. When they first meet?  Golden!!)12. THE TURBOSHAFT CLIMB Dumb idea, bad FX, lame jokes.  ...and the floor numbers are wrong.13.  TOO MANY RED HERRINGS The significance of Nimbus, the ship's malfunctions, Spock's brother, hostages, etc.  These things don't affect the storyline in the end.  Take the SOS message from the Officers Lounge. This is intercepted by the Klingons (who already know where they are..) and serves only as a vehicle for Sybok to confront them.14.  THE GREAT BARRIER Another arbitrary plot device.  They zip through with no explanation as to how. Even if Sybok knew how, the Klingons follow with no problem.15.  DON'T JUST STAND THERE... GOD IS A BUSY MAN Don't just stand there????  Captain! The director has given us nothing to do!!16.  GOD-THING The film's lame effects especially disappoint here.  The GOD face is laughable.  Audiences can't believe they're viewing GOD, and guess what? It's not.  Confusion is inevitable.  If he's fake, make him a real fake!! (Remember Balok?) The concept of an alien being trapped on this planet and Sybok's willingness to believe should have been flushed out more.  McCoy asking, Is this the voice of God? was wrong.   That should have been Sybok.  The real story of the GOD-THING is left unclear.  It needed a Perry Mason type ending. There's just one thing I don't understand, Jim...17. GHOST ATTACK There's no ghosts in Star Trek.  Having 'something' shake the shuttle, chase Kirk, and make a lot of racket is a poor compromise of the Directors original idea's.18.  CONVENIENT KLINGON TORPEDO...which kills the transporter.   Now what??  Oh brother!  I was wise to that bit before I was in high school.19. THE CLIMAX The story falls apart from here. Klingons aren't needed here; they clutter up the action,  Kirk runs from... what? GOD lightning!  It sure has bad aim. The enemy saves the day.  The Klingon apology, and finally... Spock in the gunner chair.  All of this feels like the results of a 'we need an ending' meeting.  Although I like the exchange between Kirk and Spock, this could have taken place on the Enterprise.20.  THE SOLEMN ENDING Sybok is dead.  GOD doesn't live here.  The entire STORY has been a red herring.  Still... we have each other...  Star Trek movies aren't known for happy endings,  but this one's especially dark.  Cool Vulcan harp, though.

The setup was like an average television episode, while the finish felt like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie.Nimoy, in directing II-IV, focused on the character of Spock--how he faced the Kobayashi Maru outside of the classroom, and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh.  Shatner could have done the same with Kirk here, but he didn't.  We don't know much about Kirk that we didn't know before.  Again, one of the novels would have been better--try My Enemy, My Ally for a very interesting character study of our friend James T.

For whatever reason, despite the wild success of the previous three films which utilized action, adventure, and humor to make them memorable, STAR TREK V forgoes all of that to return to the somber, theological undertones that many complained about in THE MOTION PICTURE. At the start of the film, the Enterprise-A is undergoing major repairs to get her fully functional while many of the crew enjoy some shore leave. It appears the repairs will have to wait, though, as a renegade Vulcan has taken three delegates hostage on Nimbus III (the Planet of Galactic Peace). The Vulcan, Sybok, is revealed to be Spock's half-brother and he is on a quest to the center of the galaxy where he believes he will find the fabled Sha Ka Ree (or the Garden of Eden, to Terrans) and possibly God. The first step in his quest obtain a starship for transport. In this case, the Enterprise-A.The film does have some positive traits, hence why I couldn't give it any lower a rating. The premise of the film was interesting...the search for God in space. Sure it's similar to the that of THE MOTION PICTURE in which V'Ger sought it's own creator, but this one has the advantage in that it spends a good deal of time focusing on the relationship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. At this point in the franchise history, we know the three share an powerful friendship but THE FINAL FRONTIER portrays it the best in my opinion. We see how, if it weren't for each other, these three men would probably be the most lonely in the galaxy. The brotherhood between the three of them is strong and this film shows just how difficult it is to try and tear them apart.Despite these beneficial qualities, the film just has too much against it and buckles under the weight of it's shoddy special effects and it's laughable story issues. Seriously, we're on the fifth movie here. The special effects have actually been pretty effective since the beginning, always looking to be the some of the higher quality effects available at that time. So why is it...five movies in...that the effects now look like crap? It's a major leap backwards in the effects quality of the series. While on the subject of mind-boggling questions, why is it that Sybok...a regular Vulcan as far as the movie is concerned...has the powers to create detailed illusions based on personal moments in the lives of others? I'm referring to the scene where he shows McCoy and Spock their personal pain. How can he do that? No mystical powers are ever mentioned. He just does it and, while Kirk briefly questions it, it's never explained.Then there are aspects of the film that just cause me to question Why? In a sequence where Kirk and his assault team need to overcome a group of sentries on Nimbus III, it is accomplished with Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) performing an erotic dance. Really? This is their plan? I'm pretty sure Bugs Bunny has used the same tactic. While I'm thinking about it, where did Uhura get the feathered props she used to cover her bits as she danced? Did she keep them on the shuttle for just such an occasion? Has Kirk called upon this distraction technique before? Long before Uhura's dancing had me scratching my head, I was left baffled at Kirk and McCoy's enthusiasm for the children's tune Row, Row, Row Your Boat. There is a scene around the campfire in the beginning as Kirk and McCoy are getting ready for a rousing campfire sing-a-long and try to get Spock to join them. The two of them are so excited at the thought of singing that song that I laughed at how stupid it came across.My final question why bring in the Klingons? They do nothing to enhance the plot, nothing to further the story, and they don't really succeed at enhancing the tension. A Bird-of-Prey with a captain out for Kirk's blood stalks them from Nimbus III to the center of the galaxy where the whole situation between the ships is resolved without major conflict. So...why include them at all? And why did the Klingon captain, Klaa, look like something out of an 80's hair band? I also hate that the appearance of the Klingon ship was so different from previous movies. Rather than the dark, dank, smoky atmosphere used before to contrast the sleek cleanliness of Starfleet ships, we get this even TV lighting that illuminates everything perfectly. So much for using light to enhance emotion.Before I'd watched it recently, though only scene I could remember from the whole film was Scotty (James Doohan) knocking himself out cold when he walks into a low-hanging bulkhead. Now I suppose I can see why...it was the only truly entertaining moment in the whole 100 minute run-time. I'm sure a couple years down the road it will again be the only thing I remember. The film is beyond boring and it feels as if it drags on forever. Honestly, sitting through the whole thing is almost a chore. I must give credit to Laurence Luckinbill; his role as Sybok was incredibly well done and he is a great villain but he's not enough to keep this from being the least memorable TREK film.

The whole movie to take a phrase from Spock is illogical. The effects are nothing special as I have seen episodes of Next Generation that are just as good, which is to say it is fine for a television show, but not a major motion picture. The plot is laughable as the gang at first tries to stop Spock's brother then joins him on his quest to find God, yes you read that correctly. The Klingons make a tacked on appearance, which actually will set up the much better Undiscovered Country movie.

There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and get a hold of the ship. They do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. This one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. At the core is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. It is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes don't have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock, and McCoy, but does not give the others enough to do. Moreover, whereas Shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. Now Kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly.

At the beginning, some diplomats are taken hostage by Sybok, a renegade vulcan (also Spocks brother). The head of starfleet contacts the Enterprise, which is a new replacement for the original that was destroyed in Star Trek 3, and it's not in working order yet, the transporters don't even work. Well, Kirk explains this to the admiral, but the admiral cuts him off, and says that he wants Jim Kirk their. Now, I know Captain Kirk is probably legendary in starfleet, but all they had to do was send a ship with a working transporter to beam the hostages out, problem solved, even a garbage scow probably could have managed it, but since Shatner wrote and directed, some ego stroking was in order for the good captain. Of course, since the transporters don't work, a landing party consisting of the most important officers on the ship, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, has to go to the planet on a shuttle craft. And they meet up with Sybock, who it turns out is a touchy feely vulcan that can touch you and take your pain away, he does this for Spock and McCoy, but when it's Kirks turn, Kirk shouts in the way only Shatner can, I want my pain, I need my pain. Sybock is sensing some kind of great energy at the center of the universe, which he believes to be God, and he just has to meet God, so he takes over the Enterprise, and it really seems to be that easy.Well, they get to the center of the universe, and everybody piles into the shuttle craft and goes down to the planet where Sybock senses God. When they get off the craft, they all look around at their surroundings, and have looks of complete awe and wonder, and they all remark about how beautiful it is, calling it paradise, eden, and so forth, but all it looks like to me is a Nevada desert, maybe they don't have deserts in the future, so it seems impressive to them. They pretty soon come across God, a brightly lit face, that everybody is impressed by and is bowing down to, except for Kirk of course, he has his doubts, he asks for proof that he's God, and that's when McCoy has a great line, Jim, you don't ask the almighty for his I.D.. God proceeds to say that he will need their starship, that's when Kirk figures out for sure that it's not really God, and the face gets really ticked off, and starts chasing Kirk, and just when it looks like it's curtains for Kirk, Spock shows up in a Klingon shuttle and shoots the face with a big phaser, and saves the day.Yeah, it was lame, but Shatners ego is really a sight to behold.

(Hint it's not Khaaaaaaaaaan) and if you know all the words to Heading Out to Eden then you're gold.The rest of you may read along anyway.Star Trek V is without a doubt the most hated of all the trek films because it's light on action, even lighter on special effects, and there is no real bad guy. But think back, so were the great episodes I, Mudd, The Trouble with Tribbles, A Piece of the Action and The Empath. In the tradition of the original series, this 5th installment of the Trek films is a timely pause for reflection. It's the most human of all the Treks, the most humorous, and for my money it's the most poetic.I'll put it this way the plot of the film doesn't emerge until nearly 45 minutes into it. Rightfully so; this isn't a plot-driven film. It's a film about friends, personalities and what makes us who we are. It just happens to be set in space with a bunch of aliens & such. But if you're a true Trek fan, you'll remember that that's exactly how the original series often was. Episodes like The Deadly Years or All Our Yesterdays were not so much about plot as they were about the characters Kirk, Spock & McCoy and the complexities of their interaction.In Trek V we see the good old Spock-McCoy bickering. We see the dynamic between Kirk's fiery emotion and Spock's stoic coolness. And above all, we are reminded that these 3 are best friends through thick & thin. No, it may not be quite the heart-pounding scifi shootout that Trek II was, but that was never its intent. I take my hat off to William Shatner for having the integrity to take us back to the original Trek days, even at the risk of boring a new generation of fans. Tell me, what scifi flick has the balls to give us a campfire scene with the three main characters singing Row, Row, Row Your Boat? ...Twice! And just a quick word about the directing, visuals and cinematography awesome. Shatner made excellent use of lighting, shadows, perspective and a few Hitchcockian tricks you may recognize. Shatner's directing style reminds me a lot of the Serbian master Emir Kusturica. It's a shame that this is Shatner's only major directing effort (not including documentaries & TV shows).My advice to true Trek fans (and non-true Trek fans who managed to read this far) is SEE THIS MOVIE. I love all 6 of the Trek films, but this one really has a special place in my heart. If you're looking for more than spaceships & laser guns, I think you'll really like it, too.

Logistically, this was a mess. There was a writer's strike in the middle of production, meaning the script couldn't be tweaked. They wanted to get Sean Connery to play Sybok (Spock's half brother who rejects Vulcan logic and wants to find God), but they were forced to settle for Laurence Luckenbill. (Laurence Luckenbill. Who the heck is Laurence Luckenbill? Oh, yeah, he was Lucy and Desi's son in law!) There was a whole sequence with Rock Monsters that had to be dropped because 1989 vintage FX couldn't render them effectively. (A couple years later you had the first CGI that would have done fine.) Another problem was that the movie didn't know if it wanted to be a serious drama like Star Trek II and III, or a lighter comedic film like Star Trek IV. So it tried to do both and did neither well. The drama of possible war with the Klingons, Spock confronting his past and finding GOD, for crying out loud, was offset by cheap slapstick like Scotty bumping his head on an I-beam and Uhura doing a fan dance. (Ahhhh---it burns, it burns.) The next problem was Shatner himself. Let's be honest, Shatner has had a strained relationship with his alter-Ego. In fifty years, he's not going to be remembered as T.J. Hooker or Denny Crane, he's going to be remembered as James T. Kirk. This movie gave him unprecedented control over the character's portrayal, and he misused it. He made his co-stars (many of whom already hated him) the butt of the movie's gags while stroking his own ego. (He's able to reject Sybok's offer to remove his pain while Spock and McCoy succumb.) Final Point. God. Okay, he wasn't really God, he was an alien who needed a starship to get out of the center of the Galaxy, which inexplicably, the Enterprise could reach in a few days. (Meanwhile, it took poor Janeway 7 seasons to cross the galaxy, and she had lots of wormholes and stuff to shorten the trip.) The whole thing had these religious overtones in Roddenberry's universe. The problem was that Roddenberry himself was an atheist, who believed that in order for mankind to achieve perfection, had to reject such superstitions. But here you have otherwise sensible and logical people babbling on about God and the Garden of Eden.Overall, it was a letdown from the triumph of the previous three movies, which was so bad that Paramount considered sacking the original cast and replacing them with younger actors.

This cast member was Leonard Nimoy, and if you ask me, he did a good job directing those two films. However, this fifth movie in the franchise, The Final Frontier, was directed by another cast member, William Shatner, and his efforts were not too well-received. Aware of that, I had low expectations for this film, and while it may have turned out slightly better than I thought, I still wasn't too pleased by the end.While Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are on vacation in Yosemite National Park, the Enterprise is under repair. However, their time off is soon interrupted, and the crew is sent on a mission to Nimbus III. This planet is known as The Planet of Galactic Peace, but trouble has arisen there, as a kidnapping has just taken place! The kidnapper is a Vulcan named Sybok, who is Spock's half-brother. Unlike most Vulcans, Sybok is emotionally-driven, and was eventually banished from Vulcan for rejecting the traditional logic of the planet's inhabitants. When the crew arrives on Nimbus III, they are captured, and learn that the kidnapping was all a setup for Spock's half-brother to hijack their ship and use it in an attempt to reach the centre of the galaxy, where the Supreme Being is to be found! I certainly can't say I was bored throughout the entire film. In my opinion, it doesn't start out bad. The scene with Kirk climbing El Capitan near the beginning is fairly suspenseful, and McCoy's panicking adds some humour to that part. After that, more suspense and humour follows, but that doesn't save the entire film. There are some cheesy scenes, such as the two with the creature that seems to be a cross between a human and a cat. I also found that the movie eventually gets worse as it goes along. I think I started finding that the story a tad confusing, hard to follow, and not very well-written, which pretty much ruined it. I might be able to give Star Trek V The Final Frontier a 6/10 instead of a 5, but that's it.This fifth installment in the Star Trek movie franchise wasn't too well-received, and neither was the first one, 1979's Star Trek The Motion Picture. I'm sure many fans would disagree with me on this, but I think The Final Frontier is slightly superior to The Motion Picture. Nonetheless, I would say it is definitely downhill from the three films that came in between, which have all impressed me to some degree. If Shatner is responsible for most of this movie's problems, I guess he shouldn't have had so much involvement in it.

How does he do it? He takes away his greatest pain. Many think this to be a stupid idea, but if you asked me, it is highly intellectual and a stroke of genius. Perhaps it is just handled the wrong way, from a directorial point of view. What I will attempt in this comment is not only to see things the way they are, but also how Shatner had originally envisioned them to be, but failed to do right, either by the lack of money or the lack of his own directorial skills. This brings me back to the point I started from. Why has the first guy we see on screen to be a drooling, speech impeded, nobody. Hell, even Abe Lincoln had a brighter future when he picked up his ticket at the box office. This guy would have done everything to get off this rock, even follow a mad man. But I think the idea itself is brilliant. How many movies do we know, where we pause for a moment and the hero tells somebody what is eating him, what his drive is, why he does what he does. By now, this has become a bit of a cliché. But Star Trek V makes it a plot point, a way to literally show us the feelings of our beloved characters. The sad thing is, it is not done very well, or at least not consequently. Although I like the Spock and McCoy scenes, we are not shown anything from the rest. Why waste screen time for the three emissaries on Nimbus III since they are nothing more than a McGuffin in the first half of the movie and almost completely disappear in the latter one. This time could have easily been used for the Enterprise crew, given them a more dignified role in the events depicted. It was a good thing of Shatner to give everyone something to do, but almost everything shown is done in a fun way and contradicts the character. We see the navigator and the helmsman get lost; the engineer bumps his head in engineering, and a lady pushing sixty performing a strip dance as if she were 20. Granted, those horny hicks in the desert probably did not care, but we as viewers are put out of the movie, another failure of the movie. While in Star Trek II it was made a point that Kirk is aging and the crew is aging, is this one, everybody is shown more agile than back in the original show. If we compare the appearance of Kirk in this movie and the next, he has aged almost ten years, despite the making of the two is only two years apart. Kirk is free-climbing in this and we are supposed to believe it. Then again, he falls right. Nevertheless the climbing scenes are a beautiful montage for the title credits and give the movie scale. The title credits as originally conceived by Shatner would have been one consecutive shot, beginning with a zoom out (following the first Sybock scene) of Nimbus three, then we go into space, travel to earth and then a zoom in on earth ending in an aerial shot of Yosemite, ala the Powers of Ten. (http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUUkjWsNC9k&feature=fvst) Great idea, would have been awesome, but alas, not enough money. The filmed special effects by Associates and Ferren are bad. Someone said that their limited facilities, which resulted in a lack of time, had prevented them from doing multiple passes on the starships and models, thus not giving the shots depth and credibility. The in camera effects on the other hand look very good for the most part. We have the back projected star field whenever we look out of a window and that is very convincing, also giving the director the freedom to move the camera, a luxury that a blue screen background would have prevented back then. Another plus point are the transitions we get during the flashbacks of McCoy and Spock. Also done practically and very good. The only time the back projection did not work that good are the main viewer scenes. Since the bridge is lit very brightly, the contrast on the viewer is a bit low, but nothing to complain really. The bridge is very good in this one, as are most of the sets, beautifully lit and filmed. The camera-work is a highpoint of this film. One of my favorite scenes is the camera push in on the bridge, passing the actors ending on a monitor which shows us the approaching bird of prey. Someone called this an almost Hitchcockian moment, perhaps referring to the crane shot in Notorious. It is a very good moment that introduces us to the more than disappointing ending of this flick. Again, time, money and unconvincing special effects prevented this one from being what Shatner wanted it to be. I wonder if it had worked. Surely, he is not the best director, but the good stuff in his movie works very well and the major flaw is perhaps him directing himself. His whole performance screams leading man and hero, something that director Nick Meyer tried to reduce in his movies, with success. No wonder Shatner got the Razzie for acting.The dialog by David Loughery is over the top, out of character and silly. Harve Bennett euphemised it as his delightful almost whimsical sense of humor in the DVD featurette The Jouurney Begins, but I don't know. I could go on and on making this movie bad, despite liking it, dreaming of how it could have been. I think they should give him the money to fix this. On the other hand, I wonder, why Shatner does not put up the money himself.

No show, no episode, and no movie in the Star Trek cannon stinks more than this film. I wonder what Gene Roddenberry would have thought if this script was proposed to him in 1966.On Nimbus III, Planet of Galactic Peace, a Vulcan named Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill) takes the Federation, Romulan and Klingon representatives hostage to bait one of their governments to send a starship. Back on Earth, the Enterprise crew members are on shore leave. They spend it together, even though Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) points out that it should not be that way. Including that line in the script does not excuse the writers' lazy oversight. After what seems like thirty minutes, they all assemble on the unfinished Enterprise-A. The admiral admits that other ships are available, but then utters, I need Jim Kirk, even though the Enterprise is about as battle ready as a canoe. I hope there are no officers that stupid in our military. If there are, we should encourage them to defect. Nimbus is inside the neutral zone, which contradicts what is already known from the television series. We later learn that Sybok is the half brother of Spock (Leonard Nimoy), also ignoring established fact. Little details such as fact, consistency, and cannon are not important here.Just one film ago, the Klingon ambassador warned that there will be no peace as long as Captain Kirk (William Shatner) lives. At the end of this one, several Klingons enjoy a cocktail party aboard the Enterprise. The Klingons believe Kirk created a weapon of Armageddon and butchered one of their crews. Kirk hates the Klingons for murdering his son. Does this matter to the writers? No, they simply have two enemies interacting like old friends while Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Sulu (George Takei) follow one of the females around to gawk at her muscles.Contrast that with the next movie, where Kirk labels Klingons animals and declares, Let them die! when the Federation agrees to help them evacuate their dying planet. When the Klingon High Council dines on the Enterprise, the tension is so high that a Klingon accuses the Federation of trying to annihilate their culture and Kirk compares General Chang to Adolph Hitler.It is quickly evident the writers are trying to repeat Star Trek IV's levity, but every attempt seems forced and usually forces one of the crew to act out of character. For instance, Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) performs a nude dance to distract Sybok's guards, Chekov and Sulu pretend they are caught in a blizzard when they lose their way hiking, and Chekov declares Sybok in wiolation of treaty. Kirk, Spock and McCoy try to sing Row, Row, Row Your Boat. Even if the film was good enough to rate a ten after that point, the song would cost it two stars. Wiolation would cost it another. Not even Data's worst moments in Generations compare the myriad of embarrassments here.I will charitably describe Sybok's plan as idiotic. He wants to find God on a planet in the center of the galaxy. He makes others loyal by relieving their pain. He does not even have to mind meld, he just hugs them for a few seconds, and suddenly they're all better. That is how he hijacks the Enterprise with no more than a few soldiers wielding pea- shooters. The episode Space Seed, establishes that any invasion can be stopped by flooding all but the bridge with anesthetic gas. Of course, that would put an end Sybok's invasion and the asinine plot could not continue. I kept waiting for somebody to stop him, but only grew more and more frustrated. Only Scotty (James Doohan) is neither captured nor hypnotized, and he spends all his time preoccupied about the Enterprise's deplorable condition. At one point he knocks himself out on a low ceiling after saying he knows the ship like the back of his hand.Although it is considered official, all Star Trek writers abide by an unwritten rule to treat this film like it never happened. I wish it never happened. Star Trek V plays so fast and loose with the Star Trek rules that it stretches the definition of fast and loose. No movie can repeatedly disrespect its premise and survive. There is one scene where Spock flies up the ship's elevator shaft, and passes 78 decks. I was tempted to write a review outlining the 78 worst offenses of The Final Frontier, but that would probably take 2,500 words. Does anybody really want to read that?

To lure a starship into orbit so he can journey to the centre of the universe in search of Eden, God, whatever. Once they've prised Kirk away from roasting marshmellows and strapped him into his uniform, he sets off on a rescue mission.One really needs some kind of protective suit when viewing this film, particularly during its comic moments, which not only spoil this installment in the Star Trek universe, but also retroactively dissolve whatever goodwill you may have toward previous ones. Scotty (Doohan) pratfalls after clunking his head against a low girder, the audience ponders how long it must have taken to get the enlarged James Doohan to his feet afterwards. And let us gloss over the sequence that demands Uhuru (Nichols) gets naked and act as an alluring siren. (Oh how we wish it was the young Nichelle Nichols doing the nude fan dance, rather than the 56-year-old version here.)It gets worse. It turns out that the kidnap has been orchestrated by Sybok (Luckinbill), half-brother of Spock. With some malignant Klingons in tow, the Enterprise sets off under Sybok's command in search of God. Later, Kirk will get to fight God in a climactic sequence showcasing appalling special effects and the decline in Shatner's mobility. Verdict The worst Star Trek movie and the most revealing document concerning Shatner's ego since his invention of a new type of singing for his album, 'The Transformed Man'.

Yes, the movie had its share of flaws, but just ignore those and enjoy what is good about the movie. And try to understand that the movie is totally different from what Shatner wanted it to be. Because of budget cuts and pressure from Paramount to add humor, the film's impact was diminished. He didn't get the effects company he wanted (ILM was unavailable), and his dark, terrific ORIGINAL script was watered down. In fact, his original ending would have been one of the best climaxes in Trek history, including demons, gargoyles, and TONS of action. In conclusion, the movie's failure was Paramount's fault, and NOT Shatner's. Leave him alone about it, and read his Star Trek books!

Later, that night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy are eating beans around a campfire. Spock likes the beans. Then, Kirk and McCoy sing Row Row Row Your Boat, and want Spock to join in on the three-way harmony. Spock doesn't want to sing. And later that night, he disagrees. But life isn't but a dream, Captain. Should I go on? Okay... A renegade Vulcan, who happens to be Spock's half brother, leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the enterprise land on the planet, and Uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two-hundred some-odd pounds, lures the natives with her bare legs. But they can't trick the brother, who claims he can find God. He kidnaps the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a big bearded apparition, claiming to be God, spits fire at Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Spock's sibling, realizing it isn't God - but is really a form of himself - or something - joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and... sparks fly. Then, after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving Klingons who resemble Lorenzo Lamas... The Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite (did I mention, Kirk was wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt?).

On another level though, this movie not only delves into 'the final frontier' (LOL) but delves into the true echoes of exestentialism in our modern society and seems to ponder if 'echoes' are truly enough for our hustle and bustle society. I think Spock clearly answers this question in his flawless line no. Anyways, Star Trek V does what any good Star Trek film should do, and indeed what any film should do, helps us to understand what it means to be human and boldly goes where no man has gone before.I give this film a 10, but wish I could give it a 12.

In a world that's more ugly than nice, I need to believe in the eventual success of the human spirit.The idea of an alien entity posing as God was good, actually. And maybe we should learn to challenge long-held assumptions more often, like captain Kirk did in questioning the identity of the alien. (I really liked his line... how did it go? Just a moment... Why does God need a spaceship?)And the link between the beginning and the end of the movie, with the camp fire and the three of them singing, was quite nice. It gave some sense of continuity. So what if the singing was not so good? What were you expecting, Luciano Pavarotti? And I liked Spock (as always) and the way he tries to do everything by the book - even camp fires.True, there was something really ridiculous Uhura doing that dance. They could have come up with something better. And also... I have not seen the original TV series (maybe there was a hint there to support this), but the scene between Scotty and Uhura was not very believable.

After watching it I can see why a lot of people would think that. It is a very flawed film but I by no means hated it. In fact, I liked it more than Star Trek The Motion Picture. Star Trek V The Final Frontier opens with the crew of the Enterprise enjoying some well deserved shore leave. Kirk, Spock, and Bones enjoy their time off together by going camping in Yosemite park and this makes for some amusingly cheesy moments. Their vacation is interrupted when they must respond to a hostage situation concerning a renegade Vulcan who happens to be Spock's half brother. This Vulcan's name is Sybok and he is on a desperate search for God and the end of the universe. There are also some Klingons in pursuit of Kirk and the Enterprise, but they don't seem to serve much of a purpose in the end. The Final Frontier is all kinds of weird and doesn't have much of a structure, but I can't say I didn't have fun with this movie.Remember how The Voyage Home added this element of comedy to Star Trek? Well The Final Frontier saw that and thought to itself, 'Hey! I can do that too!' Unfortunately, it was wrong. Any and all comedy in this film is completely unnecessary and either makes you cringe or roll your eyes in embarrassment. There are moments in the film where I was left wondering, 'Why in the hell did the writers think that line was a good idea?' The movie tries way too hard with its ridiculous punchlines and awkward moments that are supposed to be hilarious. A lot of the humor comes around when the friendship between Kirk, Spock, and Bones is being developed. This was always an important aspect of Star Trek, but The Final Frontier almost makes a mockery of it. Never, under any circumstances do I need to watch Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley sit around a campfire singing Row Row Row Your Boat. But I guess these were the days when Shatner and Nimoy were building their singing careers so they thought they needed those careers to carry over into Star Trek.This movie had the potential to be incredible. Sybok's search for God could have gone much deeper and been much more intellectual than what it was. This aspect of the film had spiritual and existential overtones, but they were buried by silly nonsensical scenes that do nothing for the plot. There is a lot to strip away if you want to get down to the more intellectual meaning of this film. It is something that was so obscured by the amount of crap this film throws together that in the end it was a completely lost meaning.But if you move past that, The Final Frontier can be pretty fun. If you enjoy it for its cheese than you can have a moderately good time. Especially towards the end, the film becomes completely over-the-top and loaded with cheese. It isn't like The Motion Picture, which tried way to hard to be something it wasn't and painfully dragged on for over two hours. The Final Frontier clocks in at only an hour and 45 minutes and just stays lively and fun the whole time. It isn't high quality fun, but its fun nevertheless. This definitely is not a Star Trek film I would watch again, but its a necessary watch if you are a fan of Star Trek like me and have made it your duty to see all of the films.Star Trek The Final Frontier is not a good movie. But its not a bad movie either. It isn't one of those that I just hated by the end, but I knew for sure that what I had just seen was not a very well made film. I love Star Trek so watching Kirk, Spock, and Bones boldly go where no man has gone before, even if they go to a realm of such cringe worthy cheese as this, still puts a smile on my face.

Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he's just not a good director.Actually, this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of Trekkies who say that William Shatner being an arrogant egomaniac. For although his character, Captain James Kirk, was always arguably the most important role in the original Star Trek, it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie, the two other most important characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard McCoy, are just there to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief.The plot is that some emotional Vulcan outcast named Sybok is mindmelding with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever. Grateful, they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace. Sybok and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a Human, Klingon, and Romulan diplomat is taking place. This lures the still-being-constructed Enterprise there, since none of Starfleet's other ships have experienced commanders (honestly, with how Starfleet is run, the Klingons and Romulans should have conquered them years ago). Sybok adds the Enterprise's crew, save Spock (who is revealed to be secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy, and Kirk. Sybok orders that the Enterprise take off to the center of the universe to meet God, who apparently every race has a word for. However, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the Enterprise and Kirk asks, what does God need with a starship. The entity is destroyed, but not before Sybok, realizing he's been lied to for years, sacrifices his life and earns Spock's respect in death after the Enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably Sybok as well.OK, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be enforced. Why do people follow Sybok just for releasing their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I've certainly led a trauma-free life. Why doesn't Kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join Sybok? What was the point of Sybok sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway?So the plot's weak. Another problem is that Sybok, though played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. Just because he's an emotional Vulcan doesn't mean he should act exactly like a Human religious fanatic. Shatner (who was a co-writer as well as the director) could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional Vulcan. I guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us. Gee, I guess that means that Klingons should say isn't and don't more often than is not and do not. And the Cardassians shouldn't prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yeah, I know it's sad that I know this). Please... every ST race uses unique dialog. Why is Sybok the exception.The only thing to not complain about is the acting. I've always known Star Trek to have great actors, and this movie is not exception. Cudos also go to Leonard Nimoy, for it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate Spock in his old age.Some other things I didn't likeShatner and the late DeForrest Kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing Row, Row, Row your Boat in this movie. I guess Shatner wished to silence his detractors of his singing ability. What he did was prove their point.Uhura does a fan dance while wearing nothing but tree bark to draw some men into a booby trap. After all, the dreams of all us men are filled with images of middle-aged plump women dancing naked.Comedy's all well and good as long as it doesn't affect the nature of Star Trek too much, but when Scotty bumps into an object on the Enterprise and KOs himself, it's kinda goin' overboard.Kirk is the only crew member who can reject Sybok's offer of releasing their inner pain and see through the God imposter's deception. Not even Spock can manage either of these? Perhaps this scenes were valantines from Shatner to his character, as many suspect.The concept of an entity posing as God had been used in Star Trek before this movie more than once. Be creative, Shatner.Speaking of uncreativeness, I didn't purticularly care for the ripping off of the music of Star Trek the Next Generation.All in all, pretty bad Trek movie. If you're a Trekkie, watch it once because it's Star Trek. Otherwise, watch Star Trek II the Wrath of Khan. It's way better.

Those people who really enjoy a good steak, enjoy that little bit of fat on the edge, or marbled through the meat. It makes it all so much more tasty, even if it has little nutritional value. To remove myself from the metaphor, Star Trek fans enjoy the taking of time over certain elements - seeing the ship, seeing it travel, dialogue en route, etc.If there was a director's cut, or another cut, that wasn't so very lean, I think the new pace would work to the film's advantage. Of course the worst element of pacing is the finale. When we finally arrive at the centre of the galaxy, Kirk & Co. march straight in without much ado. Think to the Enterprise venturing into the cloud that surrounded V-GER. We were given time to savour the beautiful visuals set to a engaging score.To my mind this doesn't happen in Star Trek V, and this is its weakness. I think it is still a reasonable film. The scene where Spock and McCoy are shown there heart's deepest wound is quite moving. With a little more breadth, this could have been incredible. It's frustrating that the film will not get the best treatment the story deserves. When watching the special features, it seems that the production was not smooth sailing, the finale weakened due to poor response (according to Shatner) from special effects teams.

From its opening scene on the desert planet, I could tell this one was going to go downhill fast. And boy, was I right. But I stuck it out, because I've been on a sci-fi kick lately and decided it was finally time to get caught up on all the Trek films I had never seen (i.e. the fourth, fifth and sixth entries).First of all, the script seems like something a junior high student would write. The characters are paper-thin, with the exception of Kirk, Spock and McCoy, who turn their act into a sort of high-brow Three Stooges impression at times. The plot makes virtually no sense, jumping around between set pieces like a poorly contrived Roger Moore Bond film. Apparently they got halfway through it and then realized they had to have a more definite villain as well, so they threw in some idiot Klingon who would come along and pick a fight with Kirk just to throw his weight around.Further, why would Starfleet decide that Kirk was the only person in their ranks who could possibly handle the hostage situation? What was that meeting like? Oh my God, some clown in a white robe and a bunch of sunburned hermits have taken three people hostage on a planet in the middle of nowhere! Well let's see, we have starships and spacedocks all over the place that could easily handle this, but let's drag Kirk out on this one! And not only do they insist on sending him, but they also make him take a substandard ship that doesn't even have working transporters. Not to mention that it has a skeleton crew. I think what happened was Paramount felt they were spending enough on The Next Generation and didn't want to spend any more money than they absolutely had to on this old school film.Nothing else about this premise rings true, either. A middle-aged Uhura doing a striptease to help ambush the bad guys? The 23rd Century and they don't have flashbangs? And the finale is just ridiculous. Apparently what happened was the top FX guys were already doing other movies, so Paramount tried to do the FX on their own and they were so bad they cut them out of the final film. There's a lot of other things they could have cut out of this one as well.Finally, there's the pitiful attempts at humor. Apparently after Voyage Home it was decided that they could make anything work as long as they stuck some one-liners in. Sure, that works. Ask the James Bond producers.This was hardly the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was just so inane. It had Shatner Vanity Project written all over it. Yet another reason why I'm leaning towards thinking Next Generation is the superior Trek series.

I missed it when it was first released, and, and it's even more surprising because I am a great fan of the show.So, now that I've seen it as a film crew type and as a fan (and as a creative person), here's what I think fans objected to;First off, the film itself is exceptionally well shot, and has high production values. If I had one real criticism that crossed technical and artistic boundaries, it would be that a good portion of the spaceship shots were not well composed and poorly lit. Beyond that, the acting is fine, and the overall production values are good, but the script wasn't well vetted.What we have here is essentially a family member getting drawn in by a cult following. Only there's no setup for it. The fans are given a character who has a vision, but we as the audience are not privy to how that got manifested. Regular Joe movie goer and Star Trek fan alike needed the character driving the film to demonstrate to us how he got going. We're never given that. Therefore you have to take it on faith that there's going to be a payoff to the story at the end. And there is, but it's empty, or at best half full.The actors are older. And by older I think the script needed to address why these people were getting back together again, and to give the audience a bit of reality that, like a naval officer in any nation's navy in the here and now, you can't remain a command grade officer doing the same task over and over again. I do think that was needed to give some emotional grounding to this movie, to let the fans know that even in the Star Trek universe, life goes on.The film opens up with yet another shakedown cruise of the new Enterprise. Well, no offense, but is that ship ever going to be ready? In Star Trek the Motion Picture, ten years before, the Enterprise was about to go on a shakedown cruise. Then again in the next couple of movies. Granted this is a new ship, but, well ... is she ever going to be ready for active duty? One wonders.Shatner helming this installment of Trek actually does an okay job. Unlike Nimoy's style, where Nimoy focuses on character nearly to the exclusion of all else, Shatner doesn't lose sight of the fact that Trek was about addressing issues, and not really showing off how fun the characters can be (that rose organically out of the story and plot). But the story is more or less a glamorized TV episode, and for all of the high production values that went into the film, it does appear that things were skimped on for budgetary considerations.The planet in the opening scenes has a history. We're told about it in the dialogue, and never shown how it got to be that way, as perhaps we would have in a higher budget feature film. I already mentioned the main character of the film never giving his reasons, and us never seeing them, for his actions. The supporting characters also seemed to be a little too easily swayed for what the plot unveils. Again, this is not an issue in Shatner's direction of the film, but a script issue. And for the climax that we're given, things are lacking.So, implausibility from the start with a ship that is not fully ready, a main character whose background we don't get to witness in terms of the plot's relevance (i.e. why is he doing what he's doing), the world on which he is on is skimped on in exposition for the audience (and I'll add that the opening scene should have been grander; perhaps the main character stops a fight between two war-bands, showing the audience that he has great persuasion), inadequately staged SFX space shots, and, at the end, we're still not let in on who is doing what and why, nor why the main character brought the everyone to the point of climax in the film. Nothing is explained.And Trek fans, although being a pretty thoughtful bunch, perhaps couldn't quite nail what it is that was gnawing at them about this movie. And so they chose to nitpick at things until they believed they had found what was bothering them. I'll say this, if this film had been shot as a TV episode with a team of writers, it would not see day one in front of a camera until all the story shortcomings were worked out. As it stands I think the creative team felt they could patch over the points lacking in the story with dialogue and on screen talent emoting their parts. It's a superbly shot film as far as the live action sequences go, but without a cause for the characters to be doing their thing you're left with a pretty empty film.I don't know Shatner's background other than he was a Shakespearean actor before donning the Captain Kirk mantle, so I don't know whether he knew the script's faults before going in on the project, but he seemed to do the best job anyone could with the screenplay. And I think that's really all that can be said. Yes, there's a better movie there somewhere, but such is life. If you're just into the characters and want to see some Star Trek on the screen, then this shouldn't disappoint in that regard, but it does fall short of a full theatrical feature film.

The very idea is bad, the script is bad, the direction is bad, the set design and special effects are bad... One can't help but wonder what they were thinking when they approved this project. Kirk meets god? Seriously? And why is god so underwhelming? Why is god on some planet that is literally a few hours away from the area of space that Federation ships traverse at all times? Why did they not investigate that planet before? If Enterprise can reach it, why haven't other ships reached it? Why did they shove the rogue Klingon into the otherwise philosophical and deeply emotional script, merely copying the Klingon from 'Search for Spock'? The guy doesn't contribute to the story in any real way. Apparently they wanted to provide some action for the fans, thinking the film might be too boring otherwise. In reality they just damage the script about the search for meaning and the ways in which we deal with our pain. Of course, there is a problem with the way this main idea is probed, as well. Why does the Vulcan have the ability to take away people's pain? He is not god. It simply doesn't make any sense at all. Finally, the ending is underwhelming. What is the message? That we must accept our pain and the fact that we must live our lives without ultimate knowledge? Did we need to watch the whole thing to reach that insight? A well written script could have conveyed that idea without any reference to gods and forbidden planets and crazed Vulcans.

William Shatner is nowhere near the director that Leonard Nimoy is. Much like Planet of the Apes (2001) in which David Warner also appeared, it feels like a first draft rather than the finished product. Considering that there was a writers' strike in 1988, I may not be far off. The ideas behind the script, which were admittedly recycled from TOS, weren't bad. They at least had potential, which was never realised. On the bright side, Laurence Luckinbill - whose mother-in-law Lucille Ball approved TOS' production by her company Desilu - is very good in the fairly thankless role of Sybok.Speaking of David Warner, one of my favourite actors, he has an excellent first scene in which we are introduced to St. John Talbot, a drunken, broken man assigned to a backwater planet where his superiors presumably hoped he would cause no damage. The character has also had a great deal of potential but Warner has exactly four lines after his first scene. His part was originally bigger but it ended up on the cutting room floor. It's a waste of an excellent actor. He spends most of his screen time standing around the bridge. I liked that he developed a relationship with the Romulan ambassador Caithlin Dar but it's literally in the background of scenes that this happens! He has less screen time as Chancellor Gorkon in Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country but better material and a more important part.The scenes featuring Kirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy camping in Yosemite National Park may not be the cleverest, deepest or best written scenes in Star Trek history with talk of marshmelons and Row, Row, Row Your Boat and whatnot but they were my favourites because of the sense of warmth and easy camaraderie between the Big Three. Some films take ages to start off and get better from there but, sadly, this one took ages to start off and got worse as it went on.As well as being a disappointment artistically, it was a major disappointment financially. Like Timothy Dalton's second and final Bond film Licence to Kill, it had the misfortune to be released during the Summer of Sequels, which has since become an almost annual tradition, and it performed badly against films such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ghostbusters II, Lethal Weapon 2 and Batman (which was the major exception). Surprisingly enough, it actually did better than Licence to Kill in the US, earning $49.5 million to the Bond film's $34.6 million. Worldwide, however, Licence to Kill earned $156 million to this film's far less impressive $65 million.It has a few great lines such as Bones saying that he liked Spock better before he died, Kirk saying that he misses his old chair from TOS and, of course, the unforgettable What does God need with a starship? which by itself makes the film worthwhile. Almost.I think that Roger Ebert said it best when he said that the film was of interest only to Trekkies and then only so they could discuss what's wrong with it.

This film has many flaws, but it's brought up enough by its intriguing plot and the performances of the leads.The plot involves an exiled Vulcan named Sybok with strong spiritual beliefs in a Vulcan mythological figure known as the God of Sha Ka Ree. While the Enterprise crew is on shore leave and the kinks in their new ship are still being worked out, the Enterprise is hijacked by Sybok, and holds the crew against their will, planning to use the Enterprise to get through the Great Barrier, the other side of which is where Sybok believes the God of Sha Ka Ree to be.A lot of great moments occur in scenes where the lead characters are forced to confront the decisions they made in the past, the acting is quite strong and you can sense much emotion in the characters. How different Sybok is from other Vulcans and the reasons why that is so are quite interesting, as are the parallels included revolve around things both spiritual and dark.The biggest flaws of the film are the special effects and the actual execution of how the story is told. The special effects are really cheap in this, while all the previous Star Trek films had great effects. This being the first film Shatner directed, he lacks experience as to how a story should actually be executed, and it shows.So overall, worth a watch. It's far from great, but has enough good qualities to make it worth your time.

It had always been the worst Trek film in my book. However, having watched it for the first time in ten years today, it is actually tolerable and possibly pushes 'The Motion Picture', alongside some of the TNG films, as the worst.The basic premise if the film is that Spock's half brother Sybok, seeks to find God. I guess as another reviewer has stated, maybe in 100 years this film will be looked upon as a classic but, my word, present day makes it a poor film.The comedy of IV The Voyage Home was subtle and funny but in this it seems forced. I have to say though, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments mainly coming form McCoy. On the other side of the coin McCoy gives one of the most emotional performances of the film during the moments when he regrets the death of his Father. Apart from that there is a lack of caring for the crew. Something seems to be missing, it really is hard to put your finger on it.There is a lack, dare i say it, nearly no confrontational moments of the film. It is more of a thinking film, like The Motion Picture, really. Thank the lord the re was some aggression and cliffhanging moments in the next film The Undiscovered COuntry.Scotty, Uhuru and Zulu are totally underused. In fact you could have had the film without them and it wouldn't have made much difference. A note however to Scotty's I know this ship like the back of my hand line. Kirk, doesn't really feel like the Kirk we love, maybe this is down to him having to concentrate on directing.Having said all that, it is watchable. It has no baring on the rest of the films however. You could easily miss this one out if out wanted.Considerng this featured the maiden voyage of the Enterprise A, it is sadly not even really touched upon, and there is no great fanfare moment that sticks in the memory like the TMP Enterprise refit reveal.There are some cringe-worthy moments, like a hint of romance between Uhuru and Scotty and the evil laughter of Sybok at the start of the film. You grow to like Sybok in the film as his character never really is/becomes a baddie and his redemption at the end of the film is touching. Anything that takes away from the moments when you are watching the so called God, helps! Great to here the TMP Jerry Goldsmith theme once again but the overall soundtrack doesn't stand out at all. To be honest, you will be glad when the film is over. Leave it a decade then watch it again and it is a nice trip down memory lane! Rumour has it that the poor performance of this film nearly killed the franchise. Thankfully it did continue but in the order of things, this could be deleted out of the series and no one would mind.

I was five, and just starting to get interested in science fiction. When it was over, I wasn't impressed, but it wasn't bad. Now that I look back...it's still about the same. It's certainly on the low end of the series, but it has parts of it I enjoy.The easiest thing to do with a dud is blame the director, and William Shatner does deserve at least some blame, if not much of it. Shatner didn't have his focus on the script (he was away during part of the shoot, during which time producers and even co-stars Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley helped rewrite the script), and it shows throughout the film. And his idea for the key plot element (the Enterprise being used to find God) was even loathed by Gene Roddenberry! So this project seemed doomed from the start.Another element to consider are the effects. More than any genre, sci-fi films need great special effects to make audiences suspend their disbelief. The effects of ST5...fail to do that. The Enterprise of this film looks like a step back from the original films, the torpedoes don't look real, and even the opening fall scene doesn't look right. In short, it proves that ILM (which was removed from the project early on) is head and shoulders above the rest.Now, about the plot. Let's delve deeper into each plot point-The Enterprise, despite barely working and with a skeleton crew, is sent to the planet Nimbus III when a renegade Vulcan named Sybok kidnaps three ambassadors. Why would the Federation send a ship clearly not ready to fly into such a dangerous position? Simply because they want Jim Kirk on the case? Where do they send these other ships?-Before that, Kirk and crew relax at Yosemite National Park. It leads to Kirk, Spock, and McCoy attempting to sing...Row Row Row Your Boat. What, Mary Had a Little Lamb was too complex!? Just a silly pick for a song.-Once the mission get under way, Spock reveals the renegade Vulcan is his half-brother. This is admittedly nit-picky, but why now? Why not during the TV series? This is simply a matter of degree, so I won't dock them too hard for this.-We get a subplot of a Klingon who wants to become famous by defeating Kirk in battle. This is just a poor attempt to cover that there's no true villain in this picture, and is really unnecessary.-We find out, after crossing the Great Barrier, that it's really an evil God who simply wants to use the Enterprise for his own purposes. A bit of a letdown, but it does lead to my favorite line (uttered by Shatner) What does God need with a starship?.-The payoff of a threesome of Row Row Row Your Boat? Wow, glad you could end on a high note!The film does try to follow ST4's lead in injecting more humor into the series. But while 4 was able to make it work by not getting too slap sticky, 5 has moments (such as the Row Boat singing, Sulu and Chekov getting lost in Yosemite, and Scotty knocking himself out by running into a beam) that make you groan rather than laugh. It's almost like they thought it was a parody of a Star Trek movie!The best parts are the tender moments that are sprinkled in. When Kirk, Spock, and McCoy bear their true feelings (such as when Spock reveals Sybok's past, or when McCoy talks about his true feelings after the Row Boat singing), it shows why the series is so popular. The all-for-1 and 1-for-all feelings are truly nice to see.Overall, though, ST5 is, at best, a lightweight in the series. Those who want a basic Trek that doesn't have too much to think about, or those who want an easy intro to the original cast, should check it out. Otherwise, this is for serious Trekkers only.

Unlike other reviewers here I actually watched the film and it IS NOT about God being on a planet in the centre of the Galaxy. It's not even about a God like creature, it is simply about a creature that has some strong powers who is PRETENDING to be God! Can't get off the planet alone? Hardly God like is it, but still the concept was intriguing and who better to go in search of 'heaven' than the crew of the Enterprise.True it's not perfect, there are a few thin scenes and the 'humour' should have been culled a little but William Shatner has brought a whole different feel to the film and I applaud that immensely.

It's not so much that the movie sucks, but that Kirk's own version of reality is so slanted and skewed that when the rest of us are allowed to see things through his eyes the results don't add up. It's not the way things really are. They are they way that Kirk, or William Shatner, would *prefer* them to be. He can blame writers strikes, budget conflicts or special effects deadlines being missed all he likes. Bill screwed up, not by making a crummy movie, but by slipping and honestly showing things as he really sees them. I think the results fit his vision perfectly.Take for instance Kirk's interaction with the rest of the crew. Longstanding behind the scenes legend painted a less than harmonious relationship between Shatner the actor and the rest of the contingent that made up the Star Trek family. We saw a unified front that was a wholly fictional creation, while Shatner was reportedly deliberately distant and off-putting, regarding his costars as subordinates who cut into his screen time. He was the star and they were there to make him look good, not shine out or create authentic characters that we as fans came to know & love, an unforeseen side effect he actively resisted.So Shatner the writer/director immediately sets things to rights in his world view by subordinating and humiliating the characters who had worked so long for their dignity. Spock is subjected to fart jokes, retarded mispronounced word jokes, drunken McCoy jokes. Scotty is turned into a clumsy buffoon horny for the receptionist, who herself does a nude fling in the desert to re-objectify Uhura as Kirk's occasional Chocolate Fantasy, while Chekov and Sulu wander around lost even though they are supposed to steer the starship. All of these people are elementarily inept compared to Kirk, who climbs a god damn mountain with his bare hands, showing everyone who wears the pants on this bridge once & for all.The film has no real villain since science fiction thrillers are often more about their villains than their heroes, something that would have threatened Shatner's quest for personal validation by being the focus of the story. Which concerns itself with the Wizard of Oz Complex of exposing a fraud with a fancy bag of tricks behind a mask. Via this perfunctory story of forced cosmic redemption the film celebrates Kirk's relative physical youth, his amazing vigor, and the male bonding that he has enjoyed with his closest confidantes at the expense of all other relationships. Kirk's personal life is hollow & empty without his professional obligations to Starfleet, which must exist even if they need to be created via chaos manufacture.And that is how the primary conflict is set into motion, existing only to have James Tiberius Kirk prove once again that he is as fit & capable as any 35 year old former Academy legend, that his crew are dotingly loyal to the point of being sycophants, and that everyone shares his ingratiating sense of humor. That's the one thing that always bothered me the most about this movie, its presumption that everyone would find its jokes to be endearingly appropriate rather than cheap, demeaning little shots that amount to devaluement tactics. Shatner did manage to come up with at least one great Star Trek scene though, a quiet one where Kirk is trying to figure a way out of the Enterprise brig and Spock offers some play by play advice. If the film had more of that and less of the smarmy pandering to sentiment that defuses whatever engagement of the viewer was generated it might have amounted to something. It also introduced a marvelous piece of hardware to the Trek universe in the form of Spock's instant marshmallow fabricator. Screw the limited edition phaser reproductions, I want one of those!Ultimately the story is secondary to the film's function of celebrating Kirk, and as such is the weakest of the classic Trek crew's theatrical outings. Legend has it the plot was arrived at after Shatner's original plans for the crew to travel to the center of the galaxy to find a fountain of youth were rejected due to practical concerns. Shatner apparently pursued a personal version of that theme regardless; He looks younger and more vital than he did in any of the other Trek movies, with a nasty rumor persisting that he fully intended this to be the final Star Trek film even if that meant bankrupting the whole franchise.Who knows. All things being equal William Shatner is my favorite screen personality, and Captain Kirk one of my dearest personal heroes. For my money Kirk was the essence of Star Trek, and the fun in watching the original crew adventures is in seeing him learn from having his lunch handed to him repeatedly. By the Klingons, the Romulans, assorted women, the Gorn, flying space pancakes, you name it. Take Kirk's narcissistic buffoonery out of the equation and there's nothing to learn, no growth that was needed by anyone. On their own Spock, Bones and Scotty did just fine.But it would have been a pretty boring show without James T. Kirk screwing everything up, and this film is maybe an ironic example of how untenable the universe would have been with him in control. I wouldn't have wanted to have been the one to tell him no at production meetings, and from the looks of this bloated, overstuffed movie nobody else could get up the nerve either. Though there are certainly worse things you can do with your time, and bad Star Trek beats most forms of entertainment hands down anyway. But just between you & me, I'll go for KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS again next time I feel like a two hour William Shatner overload. 4/10 "},{"Title":"This was NOT the worst Star Trek -- it was better than IV","Date":"22 September 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I found this particular Star Trek Film to be way more engaging than Star Trek IV and its stupid, trite storyline. At least this one did not have quite as many boring moments as the previous Leonoard Nimoy -- directed movie. OK, I have to admit -- the special effects in this film were EXTREMELY lame. It is almost as if Paramount or the producers of this movie did not have any sort of a budget to spend on effects. All of it is very cartoonish and dumb-looking.The roundup of the good guys/bad guys on Nimbus III was the weakest part of the movie. Not only was it dull, it did not even draw you in. Further, the hostages, as soon as they are rescued (or not rescued, as it turned out), they are no longer important to the story. It is as if we were supposed to care about them one minute and then not care about them the next. They were plastic, phony characters.I did enjoy the Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack very much in this movie. He was in his element to make up for a weak story. I always enjoy the banter back and forth between Kirk, Spock and Bones. They somehow pull it off well enough to be entertaining.PLOT HOLE the Shaka-ri character kept demanding that Sybok bring the enterprise closer to the planet so that he could escape his imprisonment on that lonely planet. He seems to be powerful enough at this point to destroy the humans/and Spock. Why was he not able to take over or destroy the Bird of Prey when it came within 25 feet of him and the surface of the planet? This was a huge plot hole that was never explained.Overall, somewhat worth seeing, but a mediocre space movie at best.

I imagine one thing could be widely agreed on... Shatner should not direct again(and I'm not just referring to the many odd and/or downright misleading, confusing bits). Some might add perform spoken word, and certain might say do fake pain. I understand that he spends the vast majority of the commentary track complaining about not receiving enough money or getting the time needed. It shows. Half-hearted would be the polite way to put it. This starts out with reasonable atmosphere, and I won't claim that I hated this. The effects aren't all bad, and at their best, they can be pretty good(in the other end of the spectrum... the less said, the better). Almost half of the humor does work, it's more that far too often, this tries to be funny, and falls so flat on its face, the ground is *still* shaking from the impact(and the Klingons have the worst appearance of any of the TOS movies, from the bad hair day to the punk-rock clothing). The lighting, well, when it was there(which is not nearly enough), it was at least fine. The new cast-members, their acting... it seems to go back and forth between overdone to the point of being unintentionally funny, and being next to nonexistent, to a large degree. Why the retread? Plot, situations, music... it was better the first time these were seen in this series. The action and story seem as if they should have had a far stronger wow factor, yet they wind up tame and unremarkable, wasting a lot of potential. The language is pervasive like the others, with a few relatively harsh exclamations. The guns in this were nice, and probably my favorite part of it. The DVD has several extras, mainly featurettes, they are so-so and one of them is cut in an interesting manner. I recommend this to fans of Star Trek, or, rather, those of them who *must* see all there is in the franchise. 5/10 "},{"Title":"By far, the pulpiest of the Star Trek movies","Date":"18 January 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Comedy in Star Trek has certainly worked in the past--consider the sequence in _The Voyage Home_ where the Star Trek crew try to adapt to life in 20th c. San Francisco (and where Spock attempts to fit swear words into all of his sentences The hell I am). This type of humour has a poignancy, considering what it says about the crew's culture shock and the realization of Earth's barbaric past. (Remember also that Kirk warns the crew to watch themselves since they are entering a rather intolerant world; this is not the first time Spock has had to hide his ears.) There has always been a humorous rivalry between McCoy and Spock; although after Spock's resurrection in ST III, there is an alteration in the doctor's attitude, which is, however, plausible after all, McCoy has had the unique opportunity to empathize with Spock and learns that he may have taken the relationship for granted. Again, the humour has a certain poignancy AND a function in the development of the plot.ST V, on the other hand (yes, Shatner directs but also supplied the story, as the credits indicate), indulges in a humour that fits in well with its pulpy style Spock's jet boots; Uhura's sultry dance; Scotty's header off the new plumbing; the campfire singing (perhaps the least offensive of the bunch since it reinforces the camaraderie between Spock, Kirk, and McCoy); the Klingon's scolding at the end of the movie (which miraculously, at least in this film, reconciles the deadly conflict instigated in ST III). Eliminate these elements and the plot falls apart Kirk dies in the first five minutes of the movie; the crew never make it into the fortified Nimbus III, etc. This does not mean that these goofy pranks are necessary but that they're a prime example of awful writing. There are more pratfalls per page in this story than a Gernsback pot-boiler (and not even as much gadgetry!).The whole plot of ST V lacks a consistency and plausibility, as other reviewers have noted. As my only example I am never convinced that Sybok is a genius, as Spock claims (think of his foolish fanaticism, not to mention his needless death). I would have been much more interested in a Sybok that could persuade the masses through other means--i.e., through his genius (and not his mind-melding). Since he believes in revolution, as Spcck also claims, I assumed that he would employ some military and/or rhetorical tactic to convince the downtrodden Nimbus III inhabitants to join him. The let me share your pain motif is another weak feature of the story (although, I admit that the opening scene is quite provocative what followed was rather disappointing).

Shatner, here doing a Nimoy and taking the director's chair envisioned something more grandiose and thank goodness because if what made it to the screen was his vision fully realised you'd want to gouge his eyes out. The Final Frontier's problems are numerous and all equally damaging. For a start it's obvious that the budget has been brutally slashed so you have a would-be blockbuster that looks cheap and has no scope for the kind of set-pieces that may have lifted the material a few notches. The posters asked the question 'why are they fitting seat belts in theatres this summer?' Watching this thing flatline for 100 odd minutes, the answer becomes clear - to stop people walking out. Poor special effects and bad continuity make for an adventure that seems cobbled together on a shoe-string and hurried to completion. The script isn't particularly good either - a lot of plodding metaphysical ruminations coupled with yawn inducing siege drama. Every so often you get the faint impression that there is a good movie here trying to get out because the premise may have had potential if Paramount had been willing to spend a bit of money on it but clearly that wasn't on the cards. Very dull stuff indeed, not especially well made and a colossal disappointment after the heady enjoyable heights of the previous film.

I guess it's important to say that I'm not a huge Trekkie. I've watched most of the movies, and I read a few Star Trek novels in my youth. Star Trek is average as far as science fiction universes, and the stories I've seen or read that are placed there are also generally average. I'm also more a fan of The Next Generation than the original series (on which this movie is based).The structure of Star Trek V contains one of my favorite story elements--themes from early on that come back later. The movie opens with Jim Kirk rock-climbing, and a few times, later in the film, he finds himself once again climbing. This gives the story a nice neatly packaged feel that appeals to me. The theme ties the story together, and the character traits exemplified by Kirk climbing a mountain have a broader significance.The movie also contains a cliché element that I dislike people doing stupid things. In this case, the stupid thing is that the crew of the Enterprise sets out on their mission at all. Their ship, we soon discover, is in terrible condition because it was put together by monkeys, (as Scotty hilariously hyperbolizes). Yet, they set out on an important mission anyways. What offends me, by conveniently ignoring realism, is that they encounter no serious set-backs due to their ship being in the beta/testing phase. I once read that the original Star Trek series, as compared with The Next Generation, based a lot of it's conflict (in the literary sense) on malfunctioning technology. If this is true, they seem to have gotten away from that in this movie. However, the story is set it up as if the malfunctioning ship should cause problems later on, and when it doesn't, I don't get that nice, wrapped up feeling.....Star Trek V The Final Frontier certainly has that western frontier feeling to it. Although it is cleverly woven into the story line, the fact remains that characters in a high-tech world end up camping out under the stars, riding horses, rolling in the dirt and shooting one another. It has a nice swashbuckling attitude, and is really fun, if you like that kind of stuff. I'm more a fan of the more enlightened aspects of Star Trek--exploring strange new worlds, creatively using technology, and the personal lives and relationships of the characters. This last thing is a big part of this movie, but the others aspects are relegated to the background.It's an interesting phenomenon, and a huge coincidence, but I think it's true what they say odd numbered Star Trek movies just aren't as good! I recommend Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan, and Star Trek 8 First Contact.

With Jonathan Frakes (Commander Riker) being the most obvious and most successful of the later generations, the listing includes half of the crew of The Next Generation, a few of Deep Space Nine and about half of Voyager. Skipping back a few years however and it was Leonard Nimoy who began this pattern. Directing Star Trek III The Search for Spock (1984) and Star Trek IV The Voyage Home (1986), Nimoy would relinquish the directer and writing roles to William Shatner for this fifth film. Irrelevant of Shatner's directing ability however, the general plot of this film is so dire, that it's no wonder nobody let Shatner behind the camera for any more of the series.In Star Trek V we are introduced to Spock's half-brother Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill). Sybok is a unique Vulcan in that he has embraced emotions and has rejected the teachings of logic. Taking over the intergalactic planet of peace, Sybok eventually takes control of the new USS Enterprise NCC 1701-A and sets course for the barrier at the centre of the Universe and an appointment with God.After two decent films and a mediocre one, it was only going to be a matter of time before the Star Trek universe was given another awful film. With Shatner's idea of a God at the centre of the universe, and a plot which devalues the menace of the Klingons (once again), Star Trek V is towards the bottom of the pile, along with the original movie. With no major enemy (Sybok being misguided and God being a dodgy special effect), this film suffers from a lack of proper direction. Whilst the better films in the series possess enemies of malice and wit, the worst ones tend to be those which leave us uninvolved and cold. With Shatner attempting to philosophise about God and the meaning of existence, the film does have the ability to get it's audience pondering these questions, but at times it feels like these people are asking themselves these questions to take their mind off the dirge which is this movie.Ultimately, there are only really two highlights in this awful film, one is the shuttle-craft docking scene and the other is arguably the finest moment of Star Trek slapstick ever created. When people talk about films, they always naturally refer to their favourite moments. Star Trek V is ridiculously limited in candidates for decent moments, but where Scotty walks into a bar after claiming I know this ship like the back of my hand is priceless. Sadly this one moment of joy is not enough to save this dire film.When making Star Trek V The Final Frontier, someone made the mistake of letting William Shatner run wild. Aside from his directing ability, his general storyline was so abysmal that this film was doomed from the start. This is one of few Star Trek movies worth avoiding.

This movie was a failure though for a variety of reasons.  First and foremost was Paramount's idea to do a trek movie on the cheap.  For instance, besides breaking away from ILM(Industrial Light & Magic) to do the special effects, Paramount was very restrictive in soundstage space as you can tell by looking at the hangar deck set.  The hangar deck width is the same as the entire width of the secondary hull of the Enterprise.  The set version was perhaps only 15 feet wide.  Some make the claim that William Shatner directing this movie was a mistake, this is incorrect.  His job as director wasn't bad as this movie had some very distinguishing scenes.  The mistake was letting him in on the script writing.  As somebody who put down the book Tekwar after reading about half of it I can say Shatner's writing ability leaves more than a bit to be desired.All of this combined with the completely goofball comedics (ie.  Scotty banging his head, the Brand-New Enterprise falling to pieces) is why this movie rates on the bottom of all Trek films.

(CLASSIC) TREK LIVES! After the first rough weeks of THE NEXT GENERATION I could understand and like the new characters,  it was exciting to turn back to the Enterprise-A's first adventure.  We take it for granted.  Imagine if they had scraped the whole series and concentrated on TNG?  Or if Nimoy or one of the other majors backed out?2. SYBOK'S ENTRANCE A beautiful shot!  That freaky alien and the horseman coming across the horizon. Once Sybok confronts him, the dialogue is compelling. Remember, after THE VOYAGE HOME, this was a new beginning.  Sybok's appearance effectively clears the palate.3.  ROCK CLIMBING OPENING Bigger than any scene in any other Star Trek film.  It's organic, and a sweet, subtle sign that nature will be preserved 300 years from now.  More importantly is James Kirk's presence here.  No longer the tired old Admiral muttering things like Galloping around the cosmos is a game for the young...4. SPOCK'S DEVELOPMENT Sybok's right. Spock developed a sense of humour.  His are probably the only really funny lines in the film.  Spock's reserve keeps him immune to the over-the-top goofiness that most of the cast suffer from  ...gravity of the situation.. hold your horse not in front of the Klingons and my favorite... yes (see #7)  Not only that, but he's learned to swear.5.  THE PLANET OF GALACTIC PEACE This is a great concept.  Wasted.  We catch only a very brief view of what has happened here and the possibility of a future.  It belongs in a movie ABOUT that.  Would have made a good Next Generation story.6. DAVID WARNER...as the Human on Nimbus III.  Possibly the best actor in the movie.  All of his lines ring true and carry a dramatic flare.  I want to know more about these people. (see No. 5)  He plays the tired, frustrated diplomat with a passionate indifference.  Even 'hypnotized'.7.  THE CAMPFIRE SCENE For those of you who find this out of place, compare this to the Officers lounge scene in the first film.  A journey has happened here.  Kirk is no longer defined by his command.  Spock welcomes his friends ideas.  McCoy is good natured and not suspicious of the others motivations.  I'll die alone is a powerful moment of foreshadowing.8.  THE HANGER DECK Finally, we get to see this often overlooked part of the ship.  There's a great exchange between Kirk and Scotty which is an example of the new relaxed vibe between the characters.  Again, compare this to the conversation between them in the Travel Pod during the first film.  This scene works right up to the turbo lift ride.  We see the longest STAR TREK dramatic pause ever, followed by KIRK (muttering) I need a shower pause SPOCK Yes Beautiful stuff!9. OH PLEASE... Kirk's response to the Admirals plea of  I want Jim Kirk!  He is no longer throwing his weight around in order to get what he wants.  Kirk has become a little tired of the living legend bit and just wants to get on with business.10.  OFFICER'S LOUNGE Nice design.  Every scene in this place works.  It's no coincidence.  Most of the other set's are bland.  Even the bridge.  But that big steering wheel just seems to bring out the best in these actors!11.  THE RESCUE MISSION This moves really well.  The landing crew readying for battle on the shuttle.  Captain Chekov. The new fatigues.  We get phaser blasts and Kirk in hand to hand combat for the first time since the old series.  This works right through the prisoners' double cross and onto Spock's dramatic exchange with Sybok. Unfortunately, after this scene, our heroes loose control of the mission...and the movie.12.  SOUND FX Mostly taken from the series.  Bridge sounds, communicators,.. nice touch.13. SYBOK The only character in the movie DOING something from beginning to end. One of the reasons this film is difficult to 'get' is that we believe that they're all gonna find GOD.  You can blame this on actor Laurence Luckinbill.  His controlled but focused motivation is believable. His fraction of doubt when Kirk accuses him of being mad shows endearing vulnerability. He's not a madman, but a man of passion.  Justified in taking over the ship as Kirk was for stealing it to get Spock back.  We applaud passion in the Star Trek universe.  His double cross by the GOD thing is not fully flushed out, so we have a hard time feeling his regret.  Still as he turns to Spock, in an effort to take the blame, Luckinbill again delivers.  For a moment, I believe Spock has a half-brother... almost.14.  THE SHUTTLECRAFT CRASH LAND Let me do SOMETHING ... Kirk's  (and William Shatner's) last plea to have a role in his own movie.  The landing is a highlight of the film dispite a contrived attack by... Klingons.15.  JERRY GOLDSMITH A beautiful score adds a aural soft focus on scenes that otherwise mightn't work.16.  McCOY'S PAIN / SPOCK / KIRK'S RELUCTANCE Sybok This is who they are... Didn't you know that? Kirk No, I didn't. We gain an overdue insight into McCoy's character.  We learn that Spock's journey is complete.  Kirk sums up what we feel in a beautiful speech.  A profound moment for these three.17. ARRIVAL AT SHA KA RI Beautiful shot unlike any other Trek scene.  It really seems spooky and other worldly.18.  EXCUSE ME... Why does GOD need a starship?  The voice of reason....19.  SPOCK'S PLEA TO KORRD Although it stands out a little awkwardly because these characters have done nothing through the whole movie, it's a nice attempt at showing some character development in Korrd.  He is given a chance to 'come out of retirement' and make a difference.20.  YOU WERE NEVER ALONE Spock shows a kindness he never could, or would have disguised.  Kirk is moved and it shows.  THEY are the brothers of this movie.

This movie was a major disappointment for me because I'm a big fan of parts II, III, and IV and I was shocked that the series went from the best (Star Trek IV) to the worst for the very next movie. The things I liked best about Star Trek IV is that it was fast-paced, funny, and well-acted. Plus, it had decent special effects. Star Trek V is exactly the opposite it's slow-moving, the attempts at comedy fall flat, the acting is far from impressive, and the special effects were incredibly weak. What was William Shatner thinking of while directing this? Leonard Nimoy did a good job directing Star Trek III (which marked his feature film debut as a director) and did an even better job directing Star Trek IV. Nimoy has proven that he can be a good director. He even did an exceptional job on 3 Men and a Baby, which was a much different kind of film. But Shatner did a lousy job on Star Trek V and that's a shame because I had high hopes for this film. Shatner directs alot of awkward scenes in this movie. The most ridiculous scene in Star Trek V is the one where Kirk, Spock, and Bones are sitting around a campfire and they start to sing Row, Row, Row Your Boat. What's this scene doing in this movie? Is this scene necessary? I don't think so. It's not funny, it's just preposterous. The main story of Star Trek V has to do with a renegade Vulcan (who happens to be Spock's brother) who takes the Enterprise crew hostage and forces them to travel to another dimension so he can meet God. It's too bad George Burns didn't show up because his presence could have ejected some life into this mess. Star Trek V is a groaner for trekkies and non-trekkies alike.

Despite the good acting efforts by the actors, it suffered from a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures.  Paramount Pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very onset.The movie begins with the Enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a reword for saving the Earth from total ecological disaster.  Their shore leave is cut short when a disturbance occurs on Nimbus III, the Planet of Intergalactic Peace.  Captain Kirk and the Enterprise arrive at Nimbus III only to have their ship hijacked by Sybok, Spock's half-brother.  Sybok brainwashes the crew of the Enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with God just past the Great Barrier at the center of our galaxy.  Captain Kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to fend off the Enterprise's Klignon pursuers.The only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing.  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill, and the rest of the cast all give good performances.  William Shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film.However, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding.  First, the part of Sybok was initially offered to Sean Connery, but he refused.  So, Laurence Luckinbill got the part.  Second, many of the special effects were severely cut back ... reducing the movies entertaining potential.  Third, the scene that depicts the arrival at the Great Barrier left much to be desired.  Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura in this film did not make much sense at all ... considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the Star Trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between Star Treks IV and V.Overall, this is a very weak film.  You should probably just skip this film and move on to Star Trek VI.  After all, the cast and crew made Star Trek VI partly to bail themselves out after their debacle with Star Trek V.

But where to start?How about basic logic flaws?  At Kirk's opening scene, for instance, he falls thousands of feet off a mountain and is caught by Spock (wearing magic boots) a scant six feet from the ground without damaging himself at all - inertial dampers in Kirk's wig anyone?  Or in the bar on the Planet of Galactic Peace which features a sexy dancer who appears to be half-woman and half-cat and is obviously intended to entice in horny drinkers, in spite of the fact that there seem to be no half-man, half-cat beings on the planet (certainly there are none in the bar - she gets thrown into a bath or something later on by Kirk which knocks her out - did anyone miss the wires lifting her out of the good and somewhat over-weight captain's arms and propelling her through the air?)Or how about the plain embarrassing - Nichelle Nicholls doing some kind of sexy dance wearing mainly see-through bri-nylon sheets and exhibiting the fact that, while she might look good for her age, she has the legs of a lumberjack and would not - as in the movie - lure every guard in sight to throw their weapons away and run up a hill to ogle her, thereby allowing Kirk et al to slip into the city (and where does the music come from anyway ?).Or let's try the rationale for the Enterprise going to the PofGP in the first place, despite the fact that even the doors don't work and with, as Scottie (James Doohan as splendid as ever at least) points out, not even a skeleton crew.  Well, eh, you see, there's no other Starships about, um, and hey - half a dozen over-age and over-weight fifty and sixty year-olds plus a few expendable security types must be better than sending half a dozen faster smaller ships with a full complement of highly trained and motivated troopers...or something.Frankly, the entire movie is dreadful.  Even the special effects are a bit ropey and the actual premise of the story is not worthy of an episode of Space 1999, never mind a multi-million pound chunk of Paramount's most profitable franchise.

I was very, very disappointed in it then--because I was watching with the hypersensitive eye of the Star Trek fan, rather than the eye of a film aficionado.  Now that I'm older and wiser, I see that this movie, although weak, is not the worst Star Trek movie ever made.I'm going to admit, first and foremost, that I think William Shatner is an incredible actor.  He's able to sell us Kirk in a way that, for me, Patrick Stewart has never been able to sell Picard.  Second, I'm going to admit that I thought that Next Generation was a seven-year string of duds.  The characters were boring, the actors lifeless and insipid, the writing lacking.Back to The Final Frontier.  Purely in terms of story, this was easily the most revelatory film in the series, next to The Wrath of Khan.  We get to learn a lot about Spock, McCoy, and Kirk in the scene where Sybok shows them--or, in Kirk's case, is not allowed to show--moments from their personal histories.It's difficult to sit through this movie; it really isn't very exciting or engaging.  It does have its moments--the aforementioned scene being one of them, the brig scene being another, the confrontation with God being a third--and those moments are easily worth the price of a rental from your local video store.In short, if you're a fan of the true, real Star Trek, and you haven't seen this movie because you've been told it's the worst one, see it anyway. (Look at it this way your favorite band probably has an album or two that is weaker than its other albums, but which for you is still better than anything by a band you don't like.  For me, it's Test For Echo by Rush. I'd listen to that before, say, the Backstreet Boys any day.)  Yes, it has its insider moments (specifically, the scenes bookending the movie), but it is far, FAR better in that regard than the dull, insipid Star Trek Insurrection.  Watch The Final Frontier with an open mind, and you'll probably come to the conclusion, as I did when I rewatched it a couple of times recently, that while they should have stopped making movies after The Wrath of Khan, this isn't the worst Trek movie by a long shot.On the other hand, if you're the kind of person who LOVED The Voyage Home, and who thinks that The Next Generation was the best show on television, you'll probably want to give this one a miss and rent the adventures of Captain Baldy and First Officer Potsie instead.(For the record, the worst Trek film is in fact the lifeless Star Trek Insurrection, which has a horribly large collection of little fanboy moments and showcases horrible performances from Stewart and Brent Spiner.)

While this action is taking place, Spock's half brother, that he only talks about when he needs to provide expositional dialogue regarding the backstory of a character introduced specifically for this film, takes a Romulan, a Klingon and Dave Warner (great actor having a bad day) hostage on the Planet of Universal Peace Nimbis III. The Enterprise crew arrive and discover they aren't hostages, but have all been brainwashed by Sybock using Vulcan mind meld to heal their pain. This doesn't work on Spock, and Kirk refuses to let Sybock in.It turns out Sybock wants to get to a place called Sha Ka Ree, on the other side of The Final Frontier, where mythology holds creation sprang from. Spock and Kirk agree to help him and off they go in their spaceship to meet God.I am a religious man and always find any movie that discusses God or Origins to be fascinating, whether I agree with the film maker or not, so I quite liked that part of the film, though I'm well aware many others didn't.The story here just isn't that well thought through. The new characters aren't very well fleshed out. We've got a great actor in Warner playing a character who's just bored to be there. And the effects are pretty poor in the main. The big strength of the film is the great character moments for Spock, Kirk and Bones, and it does introduce the idea that Kirk will die alone. Star Trek V, while the weakest entry yet in the Star Trek series, is not a terrible film, and does explore some interesting ideas and continuing to progress the friendship between Kirk, Spock and Bones while explaining their back story. It would have been an effective and memorable entry in a TV series, but not so much a film series. On film, it's just mediocre with some redeeming qualities.

Then once people had seen it most thought that maybe it would be best if it was their final film...zing! But seriously they did.This fifth adventure starts off on a good note with some nice sequences. A short intro with the main antagonist on the sandy world of Nimbus III which looks good (sandy desert like worlds always seem to look good in sci-fi films). Then its straight into some good old fashioned soppy Star Trek humour courtesy of Kirk, Spock and Bones as they enjoy their leave in Yosemite National Park. I can't deny that rock face climbing sequence was pretty amusing and virtually the highlight of the entire movie!Following that we get a brief intro back on board the Enterprise where everything is in the process of being fixed as its not working too well. Obviously this is the cue for Scotty to huff n puff with frustration at the circumstances yet we all know full well he will fix absolutely everything with time to spare. God bless that light- hearted Star Trek nonsense.After this pleasant start which all point towards the beginning of a good fun film things take a bit of a nosedive. Basically there is no real plot here and little explanation for anything. Oh OK, Sybok wants to hijack the Enterprise and use it to find the mythical planet of Sha Ka Ree...yes you read that right and I spelt it right. This planet is at the centre of the galaxy and is supposedly where all creation began...highly doubtful I would imagine seeing as there are millions of galaxies beyond our own. Why don't the crew ever venture outside our Milky Way galaxy and explore another? now that would be exploration alright.Renegade Vulcan Sybok isn't really explained at all unless you count Spock's brief flashback where we are given more big news that he and Spock are half brothers. We have no reason for his religious crusade, where he came from or how he ended up on Nimbus III. There is also no explanation for Nimbus III, its inhabitants, its name (the planet of galactic peace?), why there are horses from Earth on it and why exactly everyone is on Sybok's side. Beats the Dinks outta me!It also kinda amused me that originally Shatner wanted Sean Connery to play Sybok but for whatever reasons he declined. Thusly we have the mysterious Laurence Luckinbill who just happens to look very much like Sean Connery with a beard. I mean really Shatner...OK you wanted Connery and he said no, you didn't have to use another actor that looked like a poor mans Sean Connery, surely it wasn't that necessary.Of course the main issue here is the fact they all run off looking for God at the centre of the galaxy. Personally I really can't think of a more risky idea than this! apart from possibly alienating a huge amount of the audience who will have their own religious views and beliefs that are sure to conflict. The flip side is you know straight away they won't actually find God as how could a sci-fi film proclaim what God would look, sound or behave like. How could the film makers preach or force their own beliefs and ideals of God on a world where there is such religious diversity.So right away you know the plots outcome and thusly the film becomes pointless. On top of that the obvious alien creature/power (that isn't God) which they come across is not explained. No idea what it may have been, what it wanted, how it lead them to believe it was the one true God etc...Another issue that bewilders me with the Star Trek film franchise is how or why the special effects seem to have gotten worse as the sequels progressed. As discussed in my review the first film really did have an epic feel to it with some beautifully sweeping model shots, but this fifth entry really does look dire. As usual we get more dodgy looking bluescreen shots and yet more hokey looking shaky sets which I have come to accept (sign of the franchise I'm afraid). The actual models are sound and are clearly well made but it just looks as though the act of putting them on film has been rushed. From what I've read it does appear things were done as cheaply as possible and without the best folk available. To be honest you expect a lot more from a huge franchise and its fifth sequel.So a very silly choice of plot which could of completely back fired (amazed it didn't), plus it has too many similarities to the first Star Trek film with the V'Ger story. Dull pacing, poor effects, weak characters and the rather creepy and definitely un-sexy fan dance by the aged Uhura was also a bit ewww.Not much really happens in this film after the events on Nimbus III in my humble opinion. Its a very mediocre outing throughout with a very predictable anti-climactic finale which almost killed off anymore adventures for the original cast for good.

Of course they had some minor flaws here and there like the supposed to be formidable but ridiculous Klingons or the fact that Starship Enterprise was destroyed and it was supposed to be an obsolete vessel so the whole idea of recreating it at the end of forth movie was illogical. They should never have destroyed the ship but they had to leave it badly damaged somewhere in space for future recovery. 23rd century is not that far away and economic laws would not change a lot in 300 years meaning that it does not economically make sense to refurbish an obsolete damaged ship but to replace it with brand new one so assuming that the Enterprise was destroyed, it had to be replaced by an Excelsior class ship to make sense, of course they could have rename it as Enterprise. Then came this fifth installment. A brand new story. I would say the concept had some potential but the scenario was so bad that it killed everything this concept could be in first place. Lets start from the camping in Yosemite. Showing captain Kirk rock climbing was OK but the whole scene of sitting around the fire and toast marsh melon and sing was 100% irrelevant to the resolve of the movie and waste of time. All it achieved was to bore me in early stage of the movie so I had to pause and make a tea for myself, something I rarely do. Next we go the Enterprise. Everything is a mess, nothing works, even elevator doors do not open properly. Looks like the ship was the target of a computer virus. No sane person orders such ship to go into deep space no matter how grave the situation is as that could be suicidal mission. On Nimbus III which is supposed to be an important place but a vast body of dust with only one village, we read PARADISE in English on the sign. Like English is the universal language of the universe but it is not even universal language of the earth and certainly it is not the Klingon or Romulan inscription. Commando attack on Nimbus III. Since when captain Kirk became a Navy seal and when did he learn to ride horses? And since when, the first officer of the ship leads a field attack? Somehow for cheesiness sake, bandits take over Enterprise and they head to that barrier thing. How come no one ever tried to cross? It appears that it was very easy to reach the barrier and yet in 23rd century no one crossed it? why? OK, provided the barrier was something real. Enterprise just passed through like me passing through the door of my bedroom!!! as easy as that without the slightest challenge. Klingon ship also passed through. I guess there was no barrier in first place! On the other side there is a planet. Seriously? a planet out of nowhere? They land on the planet. Everyone looks at that piece of barren Arizona desert like they've seen something extraordinary. The logical response was to either laugh or at least disappointment. There was a genie or something on that planet who caused some scenes. They destroyed the genie with a torpedo. Kirk survived. A party and... I can't say how disappointing this movie was, actually it was disgusting! I would say if you are watching Star Trek series, just skip this one and jump to part 6. Assume this one never existed! 0/10!

It starts off with a strange opening in a desert, in which a Vulcan manages to get some peculiar looking planet inhabitant, to join him by hugging the fellow. This is not well explained at all and leaves you confused as the Vulcan's situation moves towards civilisation. Jump to a forest where, (ironically) DeForest Kelley is looking at William Shatner climbing a mountain for no valid reason, Leonard Nimoy ascending the mountain on booster shoes for no valid reason and Shatner then falling down the mountain for no valid reason and then being caught by Nimoy who manages to save his friend without even touching him. It is awful logic like this, which just makes it, pure and simply, a bad film.The effects still look poor and homemade and there are some bad slapstick humour and some horribly cheesy one-liners and jokes. The villain, an okay Laurence Luckinbill, can brainwash anyone to join his pilgrimage to God, which begs the question; if you can brainwash anyone then why not use it to get rich or achieve world domination? No, he'd just rather travel forever to find somewhere no one has ever found before, so he can talk to God. The character isn't even comparable to Ricardo Montablon and Christopher Lloyd who have played previous Trek villains extremely well. And it turns out in the end, that he isn't even bad! The crew themselves, really show off their age in some of the action scenes and it is quite worrying to see how much weight some of them have put on. The film isn't all-bad though. The lighter approach in places makes way for some good buddy humour between the three leads and the cinematography is very good. In one part of the film, we get to see the whole of the Enterprise's interior &#x96; which is pretty cool &#x96; and James Doohan puts in a perfectly timed comic performance. As director, I don't think Shatner did a bad job, just not a good job either!

Great Star Trek movie.First the villain Sybok is second only to Khan in the franchise. Spock's half-brother is not only one of the smartest Vulcan's to ever live but his intellect may be the greatest in the galaxy, yet he's been banished from Vulcan for abandoning logic for emotion. That right there is damn interesting. He uses his vastly superior intellect for mind control to facilitate his quest to find God...yet he is peaceful eschewing physical violence. Throughout the film we question, is he insane or pure genius for pursuing God? This is an epic character and one of the few interesting villains in the series. A lot of reviewers mark the plot- line of the quest for God as ridiculous, yet no one notes this is Sybok's mad quest that the Enterprise combats...and a quest proportionate in scope to the size of Sybok's brain. How did we all get here? The great metaphysical question of the world, that even in the 23rd century creatures still ask. Sybok uses mind-control on the Enterprise crew and a host of followers to steal the Enterprise to embark on a journey to the very center of the Galaxy. Great character, great plot.Secondly Shatner's direction is great! In case you didn't know, in movies epic heroes who are humble with good senses of humor are liked very well...that's what Shatner does here, he pokes some fun at the seriousness of Kirk, Spock, Bones, and crew - by showing them on vacation where we get to see them for the first time outside of work. On mission they're all business, but outside at least Shatner gives them some humility and senses of humor. It's completely refreshing. Spock, Bones, and Kirk on vacation singing Row, Row, Row your Boat around a campfire is helarious! This Star Trek has perhaps the only quality laughs in the entire franchise.Thirdly the special effects are as good as any other Star Trek film...sorry to break it to you. From today's perspective all those 80's sci-fi movies pretty much look the same.Fourthly, Sybok's quest for God ends appropriately...in futility. They don't find any supreme being semi-confirming the villain's madness. Instead at the center of the galaxy they encounter a powerful alien they must defeat and escape from...all great action and an interesting twist to put beyond the final frontier.

Then we've got the Hideous Dynamic Duo of Sulu and Chekov, hiking through the woods together... probably en route to a Barry Manilow concert. Then there's Laurence Luckinbill as Spock's brother???!!! Yeah, right! Amazing how these relations we never heard of suddenly crawl out of the woodwork when we need a new plot line. And not to forget Spock rocketing through the air after Kirk when he falls from a cliff in Yosemite. Sure. He catches up to Kirk and saves him ONE FOOT away from the ground.

Star Trek IV definitely had a lot of humor and comedy interwoven with the script as well. I also like the references to past films, something that a lot of sequels will leave out.

There's a bored Klingon Captain out to get Kirk but the character is introduced late and is underused to the point of pointlessness. In fact the real bad guy isn't introduced until ten minutes before the film ends, and his scene is a frankly pathetic excuse for a climax. In place of dramatic tension we're left with pratfalls from Scotty, scenes of Kirk, McCoy and Spock singing Row, Row, Row Your Boat around a campfire and Uhura performing an erotic dance - none of which is as much fun as it sounds. While some scenes border on the epic (by Star Trek standards) others seem to be grappling with budget restraints - the ship that picks up the campers is represented by sound effects and flashing lights, and the less said about the Face of God finale the better - which give the film a curiously schizophrenic feel.   Probably just edging out The Motion Picture as the weakest of the first seven original crew films (not counting their cameos in Generations.)

Much of the blame for how the movie turned out has to be shared by the suits at Paramount - from the miserably low budget Shatner was given to work with to the constant interference with the script.Shatner's original concept may have been unfilmable (politically speaking), but it was ambitious and very much in line with what Star Trek was always about - using a futuristic setting to discuss highly charged issues; and what could be more explosive than a movie questioning not the existence but the nature of God; that each person, each society through time recreates God in their own image.There's on old saying that there's no substitute for experience and that applies to movie directors as well. One thing experience as a manager teaches you is which battles you pick and how hard to fight; some things you blow off and some things you have to be willing to fall on you sword for. A lot of the humor people complain about was inserted at the insistence of the studio. If a light touch had succeeded with Star Trek IV, their reasoning went, then let's insert even more here. Same with the basics of the plot; the movie went from questioning out concept of God with a capital G to the tired old plot device of an alien who only looks like god (small g intended).Same goes for the lesser quality special effects. Shatner himself admits the results weren't what he envisioned and a lot of that was due, once again, to his inexperience as a director. He got caught up in the micro detail of making sure scenes early in the movie were just right and lost sight of the fact that he had a limited, and fixed, budget and would have nothing left at the end when it came time to create the payoff when Capt Kirk confront God.

Which means, oddly enough, it isn't actually *as* bad as you might have heard. It depends on perspective; if you're willing to give in to the 4-score-cheesy humor, which includes Spock being instructed on how to sing campfire songs, James Doohan doing a stupid hit-of-the-head just walking down a hall, and some delicious overacting by many of the cast (including the 'evil' Vulcan Sykbok played by Lawrence Luckinbill), then it might be worth it for some of the oddly interesting ideas regarding belief and allegiance to someone promising a life without fear thanks to God. It might even dawn on someone, as thanks to a note of interest from my girlfriend, that it has more than some allusion to evangelical right wingers.So, trying to put aside political notes, which could go on for so long here that it would be didactic of me, just to note the good news first Shatner, for all of his moments of folly thanks to the crappy special effects (and it's not just the 'God' bits watch for that one little ship speeding by and wonder how far we've come in 20 years with CGI), he's usually a pretty sturdy director of scenes which don't require a lot of action. He keeps a good control over the enterprise crew, and there's even some moments of earned corny-hilarity thrown in here and there like with the rocket-booster shoes. And, yes, there's a not bad *central* plot involving Spock's half-brother, Skybok, who only wants to take people hostage and go to the center of the universe to attain something no one has seen before. I was even slightly moved by a scene where Skybok gives a moment of revelation for McCoy and his dead father.But for all that Shatner might get right as a pure 'Trekkie' fan (and, thankfully, he doesn't make it too much of a vanity project, so no excess close-ups or the like), he also goes too far in other respects. One of the biggest goofs is in the logic that hey, it's Star Trek, we'll need Klingons, just because when they're totally ancillary figures, used only for an awkward, un-funny laugh towards the end where somehow Klingons and Enterprise crew come together following that whopper of a battle between Kirk and whatever-that-God-thing was. And as well, almost in spite of Shatner's skills as a director of certain scenes, there's a slightly dull quality to how some of the story progresses, of the ho-hum-ness of the ship's parts not working, including (GASP) captain's log. Shatner and the writers are obviously digging for something intellectually stimulating as well as going for some stirring drama, but too often they fall short of making it more than just an average episode of the series. Not even Star Trek's first movie in 1979, which had a bloated quality here and there, had the trouble of being just 'average'.If you're into Trek, you'll check it out anyway, and opinions will vary though probably not by much from what I've read. And if you've very limited interest in Trek, it's not a good place to start and might be liable for helping sleepless nights.

So what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are bad ideas aplenty, along with a few good ones, and if you're in a charitable mood, you could look at 'The Final Frontier' the same way you would a so-so episode of the TV series. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best 'guest star' performances in any Star Trek, big or small screen, ranking right up there with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His portrayal of Sybok, Spock's half-brother, consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink, which happens all too frequently. Charles Cooper is good too as the fat old Klingon General Korrd; too bad his role isn't as large as he is. If the story about Shatner's intentions is true, then I owe him an apology, because I was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and not-very-convincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet. The reason is I've always felt that, of all the Trek regulars, Shatner was the least 'tuned-in' to everything that makes Star Trek work and what makes it special to its fans. Having read his Trek memoirs, it's very apparent to me that he considered the show another action-adventure series that just happened to have a science-fiction setting. He preferred the vision of Gene Coon over that of Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work on the popular western series, 'The Wild Wild West.' Shatner also mentioned that a favorite Star Trek episode of his was 'A Piece of the Action,' a silly second-season episode co-written by Coon. So, finally given an opportunity to direct a Star Trek feature film, would not Shatner follow his instincts and produce an action-filled flick with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor? Well somebody did, because that's what 'The Final Frontier' ended up being. Shatner himself definitely returns to form as The Great Ham and, as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of 'the cutes.' In the opening scene at Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say which is worse, the super-cheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue. Running gags about equipment malfunctioning on the Enterprise have run all the way from 'Wrath of Khan' and by this, the fifth Trek movie, have run themselves into the ground. So has the idea of a 'skeleton crew'. One new development is an apparent romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two. It's a pointless subplot and adds nothing. The climactic scene where 'God' is encountered doesn't add much either; whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable, but the scene itself doesn't make much sense. (The 'God' creature's abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment.) Roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from 'The Search for Spock.' Leonard Nimoy manages to salvage Spock's integrity, even while spouting such un-Spock-like lines as Get a grip on yourself, Doctor. And DeForest Kelley, as usual, outperforms both Shatner and Nimoy; he really came on as an actor in the final Trek films. So this Trek outing isn't terrible, it just isn't very good. There was to be one more original cast Trek movie before the baton was passed to the 'next generation,' and it was far better suited to the task than 'Star Trek V The Final Frontier.'

I watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters (and the Star Trek universe, in general). Even in The Undiscovered Country I thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release. However, having said that, Star Trek V The Final Frontier is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew. I agree with many that the camaraderie of Kirk, Spock and McCoy is well handled, but the overall script, the direction -- by William Shatner -- and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode. This is a buddy movie and, at times, almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. The action sequences are not sustained and therefore, build little or no tension. The dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs, both intended and not-intended. The Klingon's seem thrown in as an afterthought. The whole Sha-Ka-Ree concept is just silly and Laurence Luckinbill, a fine actor in everything else I've ever seen him in, boarders on the absurd in this movie. The scene where Sybok conjures up images of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain shatters the image of the characters as we've known them. Spock would never be party to such stupidity and McCoy, trying to save his father is full of insipid, redundant dialogue and totally wastes DeForest Kelley's acting abilities. The whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters. I understand that Shatner didn't have the luxury of working with ILM for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight, but that doesn't allow for such a bad story. In some respects, I think this story does fit in with the old series, but the movies, including Star Trek The Motion Picture are all much better quality than this. It's a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. The focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice, but way over used. The old crew really seems to be out of character. I liked the old Klingon General and the sultry Romulan in the bar. I liked some of the humor and the idea that Spock has a half-brother, but that's about it. If this was a TV episode, I'd be able to accept a lot of the faults. As a movie, this is just bad, uninspired film making. It's a shame too, because I want this movie to be good. Even if it was the level of Star Trek III I would be happy, but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of Shakespeare.

They are dispatched to recover the hostages but it transpires that the entire situation has been a ruse to allow leader Sybok to claim the star ship and use it to pursue his wider goal &#150; a journey deep into space to a mythical planet at the centre of the galaxy to discover the place where all the answers are to be found, to confront God himself. Throw in the brig and the only ones to have avoided the powerful influence of Sybok, Kirk, McCoy and Spock try to stop him.Opening with Kirk free-climbing in Yosemite National Park this film immediately makes out several of its consistent problems. Firstly it is filled with half baked ideas. In the first part this is seen in the silly fall but over the whole film it manifests itself in the rather heavy plot that stutters along a very obvious path. As creator of the story Kirk did not have to go far for his inspiration as the ideas here have been done in similar ways in the series but even with that it doesn't do much with it at the ending and it feels like a lot has just been dropped in favour of lightshows. It does enough to get by though and fans of the series will just about find enough here to keep them interested. I think part of the reason so many people dislike this film is that it came after part 4, which was great fun and before part 6, which again was good fun. I know people talk about the curse of the odd numbers in the first 6 Star Trek films but this is less to do with the number and more to do with the fact that the even numbered films are consistently more enjoyable.The fact that Shatner is writer, director and actor is also a weaknesses and was a poor decision &#150; just because Nimoy did it doesn't mean he can. It is shown in the first scene where we are treated to the podgy Shatner effortlessly working his way up a vertical cliff-face and this ego-massaging continues throughout the film. Even as we get to the end of the film and confront God, Kirk is the one that stands up to him, while the majority of the film he is very much the focal point of the whole film. As actor he shows his as he forces himself into every scene; he has always been a good ham but here the material and being behind the camera make his performance difficult to take. Nimoy and Kelley are good and work well together. Koenig and Takei are good but I'm not sure about the script forcing Doohan and Nichols together (even less taken by the latter dancing naked). Luckinbill is all a bit cheesy and isn't that good a character (nor Murdock).Overall then an average Star Trek plot with typical ideas but not carried through to completion. The influence of Shatner across all aspects of the film is not a good thing and it does drag the film down.

While one can expect some better results from multi-million dollar productions, like the aforementioned effects and a better cut-out story, those two movies (especially 5) are the heart and soul of what Star Trek was and is about, to boldly go where no man has gone before and not just techno-babble and cliffhangers.

Maybe that is it's mistake; to feel like an overlong TV episode, on not one that really shines either. The plot is messy, possibly from having to much edited in the wrong places than anything else. Sybok's history, his vision from God, his mode through the barrier and the power he has over the mind is woefully lacking. By the last half hour, one feels that a tighter script could have at least saved the finale from feeling empty even if it couldn't raise it to being amazing.In the end, for a mainstream franchise, tackling theology was an idea no studio would really go out to back, and from what the crew have said on the matter, it does sound that the dead ending is partially through this lack of conviction in realising the productions intent. Blame the studio, blame the production for truly going where no Trek probably has the sense not to go.That said, there is a lot of good in here. Sybok is a well realised character. Despite the rather soap like connection to Spock, it never stuck me as awkward. Spock is a proud character and a character which embraces all he's fought against who is a blight on his family is unlikely to come up casually. Sybok is well acted and has enough presence to keep the plot from sinking under it's own theological confusion.There is a lot of fun here. I know cast and audience have grumbled about the crew being sent up under Shatner's direction, but I think it works. While Sulu virtually vanishes in the excellent Star Trek IV, being lost in a forest is not only a nice character scene, it warms you to the character. Again with Uhura, while her dance is contrived, it is memorable; it spotlights the character. As for Scotty, well after being the deux ex machina of the engine room, it's nice to throw such a small comedy scene in where he smacks his head on a metal housing after proclaiming his ultimate knowledge of the ship. Lighten up.What really holds the film together is the trinity of the Original Trilogy. The set up camping scene is endearing and beautifully acted. The characters feel real and honest to their roots. Throughout the film, this threesome of Kirk, Spock and McCoy are a joy to watch. The scene in the forward lounge as Sybok explores the pain of Spock and McCoy is beautifully directed and very well acted.As for the production, the effects are poor. The Enterprise suffers from some poor motion effects, and the end finale is lacking in the spectacular such a theological climax demands. There are some Trek glitches, there are three times the amount of floors to the Enterprise, the initial elevator scene seems to imply the elevator only goes upwards (even a casual watcher will notice the shuttlecraft bay is at the aft of the craft and the bridge is forward front) and some of malfunctions on the Enterprise are fairly trite.Nevertheless, the pacing is light and the script has some nice character gags - particularly from the main three. Certainly not the most perfect Trek film but not as terrible as fans declare. It has some lovely character moments, a gentle score and some solid acting all round. While it doesn't deliver it does entertain and I think Shatner and co deserve a seven just for that.

It never seemed to establish where it wanted to go. There were at least three different story lines slapped together and none of them really had anything to do with each other. The original cast (primarily of course William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley, but the others as well) show their age in this. Kelley especially looks rather decrepit. It's hard to believe Star Fleet Command would send this geriatric crew on an emergency mission. Their age also shows in the acting. There doesn't seem to be any real energy in anyone (maybe they just realized how bad this was.) Lines are delivered half-heartedly and the chemistry between Kirk, Spock and McCoy just isn't there, in spite of the attempt to force it by having them go camping together. (I thought Vulcans didn't take vacations?)Somehow Paramount Pictures must have had the impression that they could slap the label Star Trek on any piece of garbage and get away with selling it. It's surprising that this particular piece of garbage didn't kill the franchise. The plot holes are gargantuan and there is no consistency in the characters from previous incarnations of Star Trek. Since when does Spock have a brother? (OK, he's a black sheep sort. Maybe he's never been mentioned.) Since when does Spock curse? (Damn you, sir! he says to the Klingon officer.) Why would the ever cynical McCoy be taken in so easily by Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill) even to the point of believing that Sybok has taken them to God? (You're talkin' to the Almighty, Jim.) When the three of them need to beam up from the planet but Scotty (James Doohan) only has enough power for two, he's ordered by Kirk to take McCoy and Spock. Appropriate for Kirk to order that, but Scotty says nothing. McCoy and Spock are just immediately transported. (Come on - Scotty would have at least said But Captain, objecting to leaving Kirk behind.) The only character who really comes across looking good and as relatively consistent with his previous image is Kirk - not surprising since William Shatner wrote and directed this.I could go on and on. Folks - this is really bad. 2/10 (2 only because I really did love McCoy's line about Spock - I liked him better before he died!)

He tells them he needs the Starship Enterprise so he can travel around the galaxy. Captain Kirk steps forward and says, Excuse me? What does God need with a starship? God glares at Kirk and asks him who he is.Kirk is bewildered and replies, Don't you know? Aren't you GOD? It cracks me up every time, first of all because Kirk doubts the existence of the Almighty to His face, and second because the very idea of God not knowing about a man like James T. Kirk is hilarious. Even assuming He is not totally omniscient, He would have to know about Kirk, right?The rest of the movie doesn't work quite so well. The plot could have worked as an episode of the show (actually it already worked as several different episodes, notably The Way to Eden and Who Mourns for Adonais?), but as a film it doesn't hold together. There's a little too much silly humor at the expense of the supporting cast, a bunch of random Klingons marauding throughout the the screenplay, and of course most of it is dominated by William Shatner's ego (he also directed). The direction and special effects are amateurish, and even though they'd blend right into the classic show, I expect a little more from a major motion picture.Edit I watched this on DVD recently and decided I quite like it. It's still a bit of a mess, but I dig the filming locations (Yosemite!) and the cosmic thoughts. It feels more like the classic show, less grounded in the mundane than the rest of the Trek films. The production design is good, Jerry Goldsmith's score is excellent as usual, and Shatner understands that it's okay to move the camera around the set while shooting. Not great, but not awful.

Character driven..this is of all the films!","Date":"10 March 2009","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I remember watching this film for the first time in '90 after purchasing it on VHS. And I loved it. I was a huge fan of the series even back then and thought it was a great entertaining movie.The years have gone by and I have now watched all episodes of the original series and films. Of all the films, this one does contain the most interaction and involvement between ALL the cast members. True, some were for laughs (thanks to Paramount more than Shatner) but overall re-watching it again the one major thing lacking in the film is the BAD ENDING!! The story is not so bad until you watch it all the way to the end, and then it's like ok, next! Structure wise is one's the weakest! Please Keep these three things in mind (PERSONAL OPINION) I think Gene was so upset with Paramount and the past when it came to Trek that he looked at TNG as a new beginning and ANYTHING that was made up to this point with the original cast (especially since Paramount booted him out of the films) would have been disapproved by him. Of course, if this film had made more $$$, then maybe he would have embraced it a little better with private reservations. Second, this film suffered the same fate as the later Batman films from the late 80's and 90's. The first two Batmans were good, but due to studio interference (Warner Bros.) the next two suffered! Some can be blamed on the director, some cannot! Lastly, the main characters of the original trek were always Kirk, Spock and McCoy. The others were always secondary..That is, to help move the stories along. Over time, however, these characters were loved and cherished also. So of course the film is going to focus more on the main rather than secondary characters.The film reminds me of a season three episode re-done in the late 80's. Even though season 3 was not great, it did have some great moments and even the bad episodes can be watched ONLY from the performances and love of the characters/actors. That's what V is. A return to classic Trek. Not great, but fun. With no knowledge of Trek or love for it, of course this film was doomed to fail! At least II had a great villain and a death scene, III had a mystery of how to get spock back and the destruction of the beloved Enterprise and IV was just a fun time travel escapism. After this, Paramount pitted Shatner (who was to direct under contract) with greed and insistence that more humor than a dark or serious story be included. It was the success of IV that led to the downfall of V. Paramount wanted another action/comedy film based on the results of IV. However, in Voyage Home it worked. In a story like V, it did not! It was meant to be more of a darker, philosophical Trek than what was produced because of studio interference. Don't believe me? Check out some parts of the film which were very dramatic..* The teaser before the credits really gets you in the mood. A laughing vulcan? very interesting.. * the Nimbus III meeting of the three races is pretty decent and a great opening. All three major aliens to that point (terrans, klingon, romulan!) are actually together and talking things out. Makes sense since the kligons and romulans were trading and the terrans (earth) were in peace negotiations with both. * Most of the campfire scenes with McCoy's statement of being on shore leave and spending time together with Shatner's Other people have families, not us is just so deep. I will say that DeForrest's performance through this picture is just great. * the wonderful meeting of Sybok trying to seduce the trilogy is the highlight with the young father of Spock, Sarek, declaring So Human and Shatner's I need my pain! speech topped by McCoy (DeForrest) wonderful scene with his father. The film was worth watching just for this..the best dramatic character driven scene of the original series. It shows the three characters have definitely aged and not just making a movie. They have matured and stays cannon with the rest of the films. * Kirk's hatred for klingons is still apparent, but kept to a minimum. This is probably due more to Paramount than Shatner as he at least tried to emphasize it in a few scenes. * All the cast at least have something serious to do in this film as opposed to all the others! If this was all on Shatner, why did he even waste his time with even directing everybody else? Very considerate of others from my point of view. The scene with Chekov as Captain of the USS Enterprise trying to negotiate with Sybok was great!Even though disappointing after the success of II-IV, not bad. Those were hard to top. Blame Paramount more than Shatner! He had the Trek idea in hand. VI was only made and successful because of the 25th Anniversary and the studio wanted the original to go out with a bang instead of a flop that THEY had made and knew it. Why Shatner was denied making a director's cut is beyond me! They'd rather put it all on him rather than themselves. Decent movie, just relax and enjoy.

Some of the Next Generation movies were bad, but none quite so incompetently put together as this one. The tone is inconsistent, the special effects are shoddy, the plot is weak, the climax is anticlimactic. But for all that, it captures the adventurous spirit of the original show better than any of the other films in the series.A few things stood out to me the last time I watched it. First, the red toy-soldier uniforms look more out-of-place than ever; I kept expecting to see the classic costumes, which would have been more appropriate than the movies' military duds. Second, Captain Kirk sports blue jeans and a flannel shirt in the campfire scenes, as if they took place in the 20th century instead of the 23rd. Finally, the Klingon antagonists seem to have arrived from a different movie only to cause trouble.Where The Final Frontier absolutely nails the source material is in its combination of humor, action, metaphysics, and warm characterization. It probably has the best moments between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy of any of the films -- especially since the previous three movies rarely got these iconic character together. Sybok's quest for god may be a little too heavy, but at least it has ambitions. Sybok turns out to be one of the more memorable Star Trek villains a deluded cult leader on a monomaniacal mission to discover the Garden of Eden, who ultimately realizes where he went wrong and redeems himself in the final reel. None of Trek's other cinematic enemies can boast that sort of dramatic arc.It sounds funny, but I think it might be one of the best Star Trek movies after all.

There isn't much action and there's never much of a feel of threat to the characters.However, despite all that, the film isn't too bad. I look at as more as an extended episode of the TV show. The Enterprise gets taken over (rather easily in my opinion - it must have been the Security staffs' lunch hour or something) by some blokes wearing rags, lead by Spock's half brother (who should have been played by Sean Connery, only he turned the part down). Then, the ship is taken to the centre of the universe (which is apparently only a few hours journey away) in an attempt to meet God.Since Star Trek 4 The Voyage Home had a lot of humour in it, it seems like they've tried to recreate a humorous atmosphere in number 5, too. However, it doesn't really work and take away what little tension there is for the situation. The banter between the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triangle is nice, but, again, it only serves to make this a light-hearted film that deals with serious subject matter.William Shatner, aka Captain Kirk, also directs. And, to be fair, he doesn't do a bad job. Everything here is pretty standard stuff. It certainly won't win over many new fans to either the genre or the franchise.

But it's not a bad movie either. It is probably the worst Trek movie ever made though.The writing was full of odd scenes that made no sense in the context of the movie (the campfire scene with Kirk Spock and McCoy singing Row, Row, Row Your Boat). There are plenty of ways to establish a sense of friendship in a movie, but grown men singing childhood songs around a campfire is the worst possible way.There is a definite lack of continuity in the plot. The movie drops main characters into a scene with no introduction and explanation of how they got there (several scenes occur with Sybok before Spock establishes that Sybok is his half-brother). Spock has a half-brother?? And just like that, with a single line, the star trek time line gets a weird kink in it from an unexplained Vulcan love affair that was never established before, and is never touched on again.Sybok is searching for God, and this would seem to make the movie a spiritual quest, but the number of silly, nonsensical scenes in the movie completely overwhelm any apparent plot.To make it worse, God only appears in a scene at the end of the movie (another character dropped into the fray without any proper introduction) to wrap up the whole quest, but the scene leaves the viewer with more questions! The scene with God is a badly written deus ex machina (a contrived plot device where an unexpected power appears to try and save the movie from it's bad writers).The problem is that Kirk's attempt at humor in the scene (Why does God need a starship?) goes unanswered though, and the movie fails to ever address the simplest questions that arise from the scene If not God, who is this being at the center of the galaxy? How did he get there in the first place without a starship? With that much obvious power, why is trapped in the center of the galaxy and why does he need a spaceship to leave?The special effects in Final Frontier leave a lot to be desired. The movie was released the same year as Star Trek The Next Generation was premiering and STNG had better graphics than this movie.All in all, Star Trek The Final Frontier is not a good movie. However, if you don't mind the continuity problems, the characterization problems, the graphics and filming problems, and the obvious problems with the script and acting, then it's not a bad movie.

Arguably, the fifth installment of Kirk and Co's cosmic adventures could be considered the weakest, but is it really the behemoth of directorial ineptitude so many make it out to be? My position most certainly not.Sure, The Final Frontier has its flaws - perhaps an abundance of them - both technical and mythological inconsistencies, but I feel that, what it lacks in some of those other areas, it more than makes up for in others. In its defense, V is a big change of scenery from the previous four films, which all take place on or near Earth - or Genesis. This time, however, the crew truly embodies the spirit of Star Trek and, as silly as the whole center-of-the-galaxy scenario is, they actually GO where no man has gone before. In this respect, it is actually quite refreshing, despite the fact that it takes Voyager 75 years to cross The Milky Way and only 6 hours for Enterprise to go half that distance, but whatever.Moreover, there is the more closely scrutinized and well played trinity of the relationships of Kirk, Spock, and Bones. Their camping trip in Yellowstone is actually pretty charming and, although some of their dialogue is a bit iffy, the actors themselves pull it off with grace and style. Friendship, the film reminds us repeatedly, is the most valuable aspect of human - or alien - existence.While the primary villain this time around is a highly emotional, mystical, irrational Vulcan (really, an oxymoron, if you think about it), the actor does a decent job of pulling together what little material was actually written for his character and he executes it all quite well. Finally, and I think this is a very crucial aspect of the Star Trek films (both Kirk's and Picard's generations) the cast is a living refutation of ageism. Yes, they're older in years, but their vigor, wit, charm, and heroism are all still there in spades and, like a fine wine, only improve as time passes. It's simply a silly cultural and societal prescription to believe that if you're such and such an age, then you ought not ______ or people who are over __ just shouldn't _____. Who cares? Why does such a thing matter? Star Trek breaks down boundaries and borders in this topic as much as it did originally for African- Americans via Uhura's role (racism) and as it did for female empowerment with Captain Janeway (sexism). Although VI demonstrates this idea even better, of course, V is a testament to the power of maturity and experience.The effects might not be the best of the Trek films, but they're not nearly as awful as some of these reviews make them out to be. I think they serve the story relatively well, as absurd as some of the scenarios became.Overall, while Trek V does suffer from inconsistency and not the BEST direction by Shatner, it's still canonical Trek and, I find, a pretty damn fun adventure nonetheless. Try to let go of any expectations or biases upon watching, and just enjoy!7/10 "},{"Title":"And this is where my interest in Star Trek Movies died...","Date":"29 August 2012","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" They search for God...No really, they search for God.

Sure, Patrick Stewart, Picard was a better actor but his mopey, pc captain was enervating to depressing, not inspiring. But Kirk/Shatner should never be allowed to write or direct. His hamminess is a positive detriment. Kirk was spending down the immense pop culture and studio capital for this turkey. Basically, Spock's brother, Sybok, is some borderline mystic ala Dune meets Dr. Phil who creates a rag tag desert army to hijack the barely functional, reborn Enterprise. He is planning to go to the end of the Galactic rim to find GOD! The direction, dialogue, scenes etc are lame to the extreme. The movie starts out with this overgrown Boy Scout bonding scene in Yosemite with Spock, McCoy & Kirk drinking and singing Row Row Row Your Boat around the campfire, with the navigator Sulu getting lost and making bad jokes all of them. If it wasn't Star Trek, I would never allow anyone to watch it. Even the reborn childish actioner of last year was light years better than this, with the original series cast and all.

Plot involves a Vulcan named Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill), who hijacks the Enterprise for the purpose of his mission to seek God. Sybock is a rebel Vulcan who rebukes the Vulcan system of logic and seeks out the meaning of life. It turns out that he is Spock's half brother. Luckinbill is terrific as Sybok but the script is too complex and almost incoherent and drags the film down. Director William Shatner does his best but the film's theme is too difficult to deliver.

Let's hit the two positive points/scenes of the film the campfire and scenes leading up to were decent and the What does God need with a starship? dialogue scene in the (so-called) climax. Other than those two sections, this movie is a complete waste of space and is the worst of all Star Trek films. Leave it to Hollywood; they have on their hands the highest grossing (to date &#x96; 04/04/09) 'Trek' film, 'IV,' and what do they do? Cut the budget. Huh? The 'Superman' franchise did this too, sort of 'Superman III' made a sizable amount, and they slashed the budget for 'IV' and in turn, made pennies. Same thing with 'Star Trek V.' The budget seemed like it was a fourth of the size of one of the original episodes. The movie begins with an iconic MST3k meeting in the neutral zone with a renegade-Vulcan and a Michael Stipe on Meth. Meanwhile the new Enterprise from 'IV' has it share of problems &#x96; enter in the lame Scotty jokes &#x96; but is still sent to rescue hostages from the Vulcan. His mission (and yes, I will ruin to save you from seeing this crud) is to lure a Federation ship, in order to steal and meet up with God in the center of the universe, a la 'The Wizard of OZ.' Honestly, beyond 'Star Trek,' this was one of the worse movies I've ever seen. Thankfully, Shatner didn't kill the series. Watch 'VI' for redemption.

Well, I'm glad I didn't. While it has it's awkward spots and shoddy special effects, the movie is still an entertaining ride. The first thing I noticed was that it just felt different from the previous movies. It took me a few minutes to realize why. This movie was much more lighthearted than the previous ones. If anything, it seemed more in line with the original series than anything else up to that point. They used a lot of the same sound effects as TOS, the effects were kinda cheesy, and even the communicators and phasers looked to be the same. The movie was actually funny, too, lightening the mood that much more. I'm not saying that it's perfect. Like I said, the effects at points are so jarringly bad that they take you out of the movie for a few moments; the exact opposite effect they should have. Some of the plot elements were a little questionable, such as how easy the ship was to take over, or Kirk's over-reaction to one of Spock's choices later in the movie. But if you can look past these little things and the canonical inconsistencies (something with 78 decks? I don't know, I've only just gotten into this stuff), you'll find a story that's pretty interesting, and actually thought provoking at some points. Go into this movie expecting little, and I think you'll come out with a lot. now, if they can remaster this one like they did TOS, we'll be in business.

This film has good intentions; it seeks to return to Trek's potent theme of exploration, of seeking answers on more than just the physical level, after a trilogy of films which stressed space battles, chasing about and future politics. However, the writer and first-time director Shatner should be court-martialed they seem to have no understanding of the concepts presented or even of the general Trek universe. The first half of the film seems influenced by Shatner watching too many action movies taking place in the desert; he appears hellbent on transplanting scenes from Lawrence of Arabia into the Trek worlds. Overall, Shatner's approach is best described as flippant; he sets up scenes well, then throws them away with ludicrous turns of plot, such as the early one where Spock plays Superman to the rescue of Kirk's Lois Lane in Yosemite National Park. No one paused to think or challenge Shatner with the opinion that it just looks plain silly. He extends this approach to his fellow actors. Yes - Doohan, Takei, Koenig and Nichols are given more to do than usual here, but the extra stuff usually involves them looking clownish; we're not laughing with them, as in the previous The Voyage Home, but at them Sulu & Chekov lost in the woods; Uhura's 'erotic' dance; Scotty knocking himself out. Was Shatner hinting that they were all acquiring senility by this point? And what was the point of all the business about nothing working on this new Enterprise? I guess Starfleet rushed in putting this NCC-1701-A ship together? Shatner is now ridiculing the ship, on top of everything else.This isn't a total mess. A lot of the casual banter, mostly among the main trio (Kirk,Spock,McCoy) still works, a benefit of these actors having worked together for so long. But, the one who steals the movie is Luckinbill as the enigmatic Sybok, the emotional Vulcan who drives the plot. It's a charismatic performance and you kind of buy into the whole premise of his hypnotic power to gather his followers, including even key members of Kirk's crew. The most powerful scene must be when Sybok uses his power on McCoy and we get a glimpse into what drove this character during the original series, including his often fatalistic approach to things. The whole thing revolves around Sybok's plan to acquire a starship so that he can journey to the galactic barrier (the same one from the Where No Man Has Gone Before pilot episode?), pierce it to enter the galactic center and meet God. It's not very complicated. And they make it look easy enough so that almost anyone could zoom in over there. Once there, they encounter a run-of-the-mill energy alien - the kind they ran into every other week on the original series, and Sybok gets a cold splash of reality; yes, life is certainly not a dream. Shatner is not able to tie the thought-provoking concepts together into some kind of cohesive whole, probably because he was more concerned with presenting an action picture. For him, it was more exciting to have his character climbing rocks or scrambling to avoid an angry alien than to attempt some metaphysical answers. Blame was placed on lack of money for better FX at the climax, but I really don't think that would have helped. This should have been the death-knell of the film series, but they managed to bring them all back together for a classy finish in the next one, The Undiscovered Country.

While I narrowly think the first film should get this honor because so much was expected from it and it had such an enormous budget, I could definitely understand those who would vote for the fifth one as being the worst. The script and direction, to put it mildly, stink. And, BOTH can be traced back to William Shatner--the sole reason this film turned out to be like a giant turd.The film's plot is just dumb. Spock apparently has a brother we've never heard about who has devoted his life to anti-logic. He's a hyper-emotional freak who is so charismatic that beings from across the galaxy join him on his quest to find God. Not exactly logical, huh?! Anyways, he obtains helpers due to his psychic psychoanalytic powers (huh?) and gains control of the Enterprise. The commandeered ship arrives at a lonely place where he determines God is waiting to have a pow-wow. Unfortunately, it turns out this probably isn't God as it's evil and they manage to kill it! And, when it's all over, the crew and Spock's brother realize the entire mission has just been a waste of time--I sure could have told him that!! The movie is dull and the plot is mega-stupid....nuf' said?!By the way, although it really had NOTHING to do with the film, there was a segment where Kirk, Spock and McCoy are camping out and rock climbing back on Earth.

Adding to this problem is that the most rotten dialogue has been heaped upon the shoulders of a singular character whose presence is utterly apocryphal.Nonetheless, the blame for this disaster often seems to be sent in the wrong direction. While William Shatner will never be my first choice to direct a film, much of the problem seems to be with the people he's working for. Paramount seemed to be in a hurry to get this film out of the gate after the success of the previous film. Special effects houses were too booked out to get the shots needed to complete the film properly, or at least according to what the writers had in mind. Rather than hold off on releasing the film and wait for the chance to get things done right, Paramount simply threw good money after bad. The result, inevitably, was a weak and lifeless film. Fox would later repeat this mistake with Alien 3, but the producers of the Star Trek series at least saw this as a hard lesson learned.When you get down to it, however, Star Trek as a franchise used to thrive on not having the money or resources to dazzle the viewer with flashy effects. Instead, like a certain long-running British television series, it concentrated on presenting strong stories with a powerful humanistic theme. It is a testament to the power of stories that the original Star Trek, in spite of looking as if it were made for six pennies per episode, has more of a hardcore following today than any of its spin-offs.This, unfortunately, is where a major part of the films' weaknesses come from. The first film, The Wrath Of Khan, and The Undiscovered Country notwithstanding, as the films' special effects have evolved, the stories and performances seem to have devolved. Nowhere is this more evident than here, where the scaling back of the effects due to a lack of available expertise has left the makers struggling for something to fill the void with. Many sequences, especially the moment with McCoy recalling one of the formative episodes of his past, feel tacked on for the sole purpose of padding out the running time. If you're stuck for material to make a 100-minute film, make a 90-minute film instead, guys. Or better yet in this case, ditch the script you're working on and write something else.Finally, Spock's long-last half-brother seems about as Vulcan as a Uruk-Hai berserker. This brings two explanations to mind. Either there are more Human women on Vulcan than previously indicated, or Sarek is in fact quite randy. Neither explanation really works, and Sybok comes off as the kind of last-minute story element a child comes up with during playtime as a result. The fact that, as previously mentioned, he has the burden of carrying almost all of the worst-written dialogue does not help.I gave The Final Frontier a one out of ten. Gene Roddenberry had all but indicated that this was not canonical Star Trek, and after seeing this abomination for myself, I am not surprised. Its only real use would be as the basis for a new MST3000 episode.

From the original series, The Savage Curtain and Spectre of the Gun are two episodes that have gone into that abyss. And the worst of the six movies, Star Trek V The final Frontier, literally began its journey beyond the finite universe, and also ended up spiraling into Stephen Hawking's space whirlpool.Based on a quarter-baked story by William Shatner, The Final Frontier begins with a first scene with Kirk, Spock and McCoy at a campfire--well more like Bill, Leonard, and DeForest just goofing around instead of being in their Star Trek characters. The acting in this movie brings the viewer into the strange predicament of actually missing the character of Trelane from The Squire of Gothos. For all Trelane's tomfoolery, at least he had interesting traits. Eventually, the premise of the story is stated a kind of search for God. The crew becomes mesmerized by a renegade has-been Klingon named Sybok determined to find God. At first he kidnaps the ship and crew but eventually moves them to join his quest. A sort of Quest for the Holy Grail via warp speed.For a moment, the movie appeared to be onto something when the ship speeds along to the barrier of the known universe. Unfortunately, the world where captain Kirk and friends find God was not only a huge disappointment but God himself was more reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon villain. Even Apollo in Who Mourns for Adonis had much more character and interest. At this point I began thinking about the stupidity of the episode when the Enterprise meets Abe Lincoln. I really felt I had entered into the black hole of cinema abyss. Upon entering, my only hope is that I wouldn't be in a setting with Bill Shatner at a Yosemite campfire trying to sing silly songs for eternity. I would much prefer a 30-year-old Joanna Linville (who played the Romulan Commander in The Enterprise Incident) to come along with me for the ride.

However those films are cinematic giants compared to this turkey, a true reminder of the double-edged sword that was the original series and it's films. When it was good, like the Wrath of Khan, it was excellent. When it was bad, like the Final Frontier it was awful.After an inauspicious start with the second worst Trek film made, the Motion Picture, the series found it's silver screen legs with three solid outings in Two, Three and Four, Unfortunately the Final Frontier is no equal to it's three predecessors. At least director Shatner attempted to aim high, trying to blend in aspects of all three films into his picture. The comedy of the Voyage Home, the supernatural elements of Search for Spock and a darker storyline, involving hostages and hi-jacking. None of these elements blend successfully into the film however. The comedy is cheap slapstick at it's best, the supernatural scene with Shakiri is humorous but not in a good way. The Enterprize being hi-jacked by a rag-tag army in cloaks is less believable than the world being saved by humpback whales.And to top it all off the story is complete nonsense. Sure the Voyage Home had a silly plot but it was saved by it's comedy and light-hearted approach. The plot of the Search for Spock is saved by the payoff of seeing Spock alive at the end. The Final Frontier has no such redeeming feature, and as such, the titanic rubbishness of the story is exposed, brutally.There are some good points. The focus on Kelly, Shatner and Nimoy is strong and they have good chemistry throughout the film. The funniest moments involve them, and also the films best and most powerful scenes. Their acting is good and strong throughout and helps save the film from being unwatchable.In my opinion this just pips the Motion Picture for worst Trek film simply because the Motion Picture was a first attempt. This coming after three good movies should have been far better "},{"Title":"What the hell are u thinking other reviewers, come on this movie is great!","Date":"23 September 2005","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" MAY CONTAIN SPOILER!!!

But William Shatner's directional debut offers to tell a Trek story that many writers and directors have avoided in Roddenberry's universe; the existence of GOD. Hence, the title referring to ' The Final Frontier ' beyond the universe. This film leaves questions to be answered, but it does indeed acknowledge the fact that mysticism, spirituality and faith are indeed a crucial topic to be discussed in Star Trek, as is science and technology. The same philosophy of Nature/Spirit v.s. Science/Technology can be seen in Insurrection as well. In any case, this film explores another version of the final frontier, which in this case, is the question of our existence. It has great humor and chemistry between our favorite Trek characters , a sweeping epic score by Jerry Goldsmith, and breathtaking cinematography of Yosimite National Park and The Great Barrier. Technically, this is in fact the last mission of the original crew that involves a mission of exploration and wonder. I say this because The Undiscovered Country was a story about a huge political event that would shape the future of The Federation. Out of all the Trek films, this one feels more like an epic fantasy than the cold mechanical feel of let us say... First Contact (another great film). I respect the job they did with Star Trek 5, and I was glad to see Star Trek take a bold approach by touching on the issue of GOD and faith, just like the courage taken by the writers of Deep Space Nine (which I truly see as the greatest of all Trek series). The performances are also great, especially from Sybock ( the antagonist played by Lawrence Luckinbill). Sybock is by far the most complex and convincing villain of all Trek films and is sadly overlooked. So, overall...I absolutely recommend this feature ! "}{"Title":"Absolutely PATHETIC.

The Trek movies (and TV episodes) vary in quality like in any series, which is to be expected, but this piece of you-know-what is in a stinky league all by itself. Watching its amateurish direction and atrocious editing is a nightmare for anyone who appreciates well-made films. Along with absolutely pitiful and unfunny humor comes completely awful effects that are not at all special and painfully unthreatening villains.SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD (Not That It Matters)...William Shatner, the true villain for brewing this up in the first place, for some reason treats this Trek entry as a Jerry Lewis-style comedy, and Jim Kirk like a complete moron. Now, I realize that Trek has a special brand of humor that Star Trek IV was able to convey, and Paramount was probably hoping for more of it. But having Kirk act like Jack Tripper from Three's Company, Spock mispronouncing marshmallows and Scotty banging his head on a low ceiling and doing a slapstick-style flop onto his ass isn't just unfunny, it's not Star Trek. And the Klingon having to apologize at the end, oooh, I almost peed myself. Ha ha. (Yes, on one a dark day, I did watch the entire accursed thing on video. My ex-girlfriend made me do it.) Kirk wearing a Go climb a rock T-shirt? I don't think so.And Sybok??? I've seen more threatening characters hanging out in a mall food court. And regarding Uhura... Ugh.

Maybe Bones should've taken his shirt off, that would've really gotten results.Yes, I hate this movie. I think you will too, WHETHER you are a Trekker or not. Even Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek's creator, reportedly detested it but unfortunately he had only limited control over his baby. I will force myself to say one positive thing, however. The only even remotely palatable scene in this mistake is the always good DeForrest Kelley (R.I.P.)'s short scene re-living a tragedy. To think that the excellent novel Probe, which told the story of the mysterious Earth-threatening Probe from Star Trek IV, was nearly adapted instead. What was Shatner on? ...

The fifth instalment perhaps had too much to live up to given the success of the fourth. The idea that Shatner was literally taking the helm this time round was a welcome gesture by fans before release. The feeling generally is one of disappointment among audiences and I for one can see why for various reasons. The general direction particularly during general conversation scenes on board the Enterprise does lack a natural flow, and there is perhaps too much faith in the humour which falls down. The premise is the appearance of Spocks half brother Sybok, who stages a coup in the first act to get his hands on the Enterprise. His real quest is to reach the centre of the galaxy where he believes god himself awaits. On the upside there are excellent insights into the pasts and angst of the major characters, delivered with some reasonable humanity. There is also a wonderful ironic paradox whereby Sybok is all Vulcan, but has embraced all emotion unlike his half human brother who hasn't. The main complaint I have (spoiler time) is what we find at the end when we arrive at our destination. It appears at first that there is indeed exactly what we were looking for - however it soon becomes apparent that it is in fact a sinister evil. It is this which begs the question Okay, so what was it? and we are never given an answer. It would have been more satisfying if this entity had somehow manipulated Sybok's actions from the beginning - the motive was certainly there. The film in my mind does seem to lack a subplot or two. There were indeed rumours that Shatner panicked towards the end of production and closed proceedings early. The other problem I see here is that we have, like Insurrection, a disconnected isolated story which has no landmark events to progress the series. These events abundant in The Undiscovered Country and the three before this. One feels that you should not squander an entire movie on a self contained yarn. The middle act is definitely the jewel here with the bond of humanity and focus on friendship between our three main friends is priceless, but the dated effects, overambitious subject matter and general strained direction do let it down.
