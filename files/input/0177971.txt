[{"Title":"Warning  Dramamine Recommended","Date":"4 July 2005","Score":"128 out of 162 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" Yes I know. I've heard all the complaints already. That's not how it happened (as if anybody really knows); All of those events could not have co-occurred on the same boat in the same trip (as if anybody really knows); etc. etc. Well, here's my answer - it's a movie, just a movie. Don't see a movie to learn about what really happened unless the film states very clearly that it is a documentary. Films are, like good books, supposed to tell you something true about people, about things that happen, and about life. They're not (even when they're placed in the documentary shoebox) necessarily about what really happened and how.The Perfect Storm is a heavily fictionalized speculation concerning the experience of the Andrea Gayle and its crew during the 'storm of the century' in the early nineties. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg head a fine, under-appreciated cast, as regular yankee fishermen, their friends, and family, living in the Massachussetts town of Gloucester (pronounced Glosta for those of you from away). Billy Tyne (Clooney) is a once legendary long-line (swordfish) captain who is down on his luck and needs a big catch to bring himself back into the fold. He and his crew set out to find that catch on exactly the wrong day, in exactly the wrong place. The second half of the film is their attempt to get home, and also incorporates Coast Guard rescue action scattered all around the Atlantic during the massive storm.Having lived in Maine for years, and having gotten myself thoroughly immersed in the ballads of Ruth Moore and the amazing New England Maritime culture, I have to admit that I was predisposed to like this film, despite all of the issues my fellow reviewers have harped on. And no, I haven't read the book, nor do I intend to. Still, in an attempt to be somewhat objective, I gave it an 8 and I'll give it an above average recommendation, but I will also say that my inclination was to give it an 9 or a 10.This film mixes New England fishery and sailor lore, a few scattered facts about the Andrea Gayle Story, and a lot of dramatic license, to tell a story about the heroism of the average American and their families. It is also an homage to the the New England fishing industry and its traditions. Though it is easy to mistake the real life heroes (the Coast Guard operatives who saved so many lives during that storm) for the heroes of the film, the crew of the Andrea Gayle and their loved ones are the real heroes here - in their valiant efforts to save themselves, their boat, and their catch.The performances and the script are strong and the characters very well realized (though fictionalized). Wahlberg and Clooney are great. Clooney gives the best performance I have seen him give. Some of the smaller parts deserve special mention - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Michael Ironside, Diane Lane and John C. Reilly are always very good (or better), but I was unexpectedly charmed by John Hawkes, William Fichtner and Janet Wright.It is impossible to discuss this film without talking about the amazing special effects. To summarize, the first time I saw The Perfect Storm, I actually had difficulty sleeping because I felt the bed rocking to the rhythm of imaginary waves each time my eyes closed. Had I seen it in a theater, I am convinced that I would have considered popping a dramamine. Although at times exaggerated, this is the best film re-creation of sea storms I have ever seen. Every scene is thoroughly believable and marvelously detailed, even down to the weird patchiness of an incoming torrent often called the calm before the storm.Obviously, I liked this film. And I will give it a strong recommendation with a couple of caveats. First - if you're not somebody who appreciates New England culture and understands something of the kind of humble heroism Glosta Men (and women) are expected to have, you might not get it completely. Second - if you come to this looking for a story that rings true in the sense of objective history, you have come to the wrong place. Otherwise, sit back with some popcorn and somebody you love, and enjoy the ride.

Obviously, we can't know what was actually said or done once the Andrea Gail lost radio contact (and isn't that true of any movie based on historical fact - we can only surmise the actual dialog and conversations that may have taken place).  However, the characters were based on the actual crew members and the Coast Guard did have to ditch one helicopter during the storm - from a story I read in People magazine, I'd say the portrayal of the Coast Guard's actions were accurate.  I can't say I liked this movie - perhaps remembering the terror of that night (I lived in a seaside town and the ocean had come over the seawall and was filling up streets 3 and 4 blocks in from the beach) makes it difficult for me to watch this movie as entertainment.  In answer to one post here, Clooney said that the Boston accent is one of the most difficult and he didn't even want to attempt it - Markie Mark is from Boston so it wasn't a stretch for him.  The special effects are phenomenal of course...I just wish it had a different ending.  By the way, the statue of the fisherman at the ship wheel shown at the beginning of the movie is an actual Gloucester landmark (and you can see it on Gorton frozen seafood products which come from Gloucester) - the legend on the base of the monument says, Those that go down to the sea in ships...

Ron Howard perfected the art with Apollo 13 and now Wolfgang Petersen continues on with The Perfect Storm.   This story of Gloucester, MA. fishermen who go out for one last try at a big payoff in a slumping season packs quite a wollup once they get caught up in an event that had never before been recorded  the perfect storm.  From there, you have to suspend belief just a bit and drink in the events occurring aboard the Andrea Gail.  It's not tough, as the cast delivers them perfectly.George Clooney may have played his signature role as Capt. Billy Tyne, skipper of the ill-fated Andrea Gail on that fateful day in 1991.  Clooney comes off as neither overly glamorous, or bigger than life, but as a simple common man just trying to break his fishing slump and bring home a big payday for his boss, his crew, and himself.  When George relaxes and puts himself into a role, he is better off, and Capt. Tyne is the pinnacle of that for him.Mark Wahlberg comes on board as Bobby Shatford, a rookie fisherman who is trying to make a better life for himself and his girlfriend Chris (nicely played by Diane Lane).  Bobby is the only character given equal depth to Billy and comes off with the same impression  a good guy who was trying hard to make a better life.  Very nicely done here as well.Supporting cast is good, John C. Reilly as Dale Murph Murphy, William Fichtner as David Sully Sullivan, a late arrival to the Andrea Gail's crew, Michael Ironside as the profit first Bob Brown.  All of these stellar characterizations and serve brilliantly to put you into Gloucester of 1991.Wolfgang Petersen has created a gripping film, full of chillingly realistic special effects.  He skillfully took Sebastian Junger's novel and tweaked it to fit the confines of the motion picture screen.  Casting and acting by all involved was perfect and you never once feel like anything is overacted or overly dramatic, just that you are somehow involved with the fear that had to have been involved on that night.4 1/2 out of 5 "},{"Title":"A roller coaster ride on water","Date":"2 July 2000","Score":"55 out of 85 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  I was struck by the documentary quality of this film, and couldn't help but look back to an earlier Peterson film, Das Boot, where we got up close and intimate with all the crew of the submarine--where they slept, went to the washroom, their soaking wet clothes, the damp, the stink of unwashed clothes, the  claustrophobia on board.  I had absolutely no trouble believing that Mark Wahlberg and Clooney were fishermen, trying to earn a hardscrabble living against a tough and unforgiving sea.  The movie even starts slowly, giving the viewers insights into their lives at home, why they fish, and why they make the decisions later on in the movie.   Then the film starts to slowly build the tension as the storm builds in strength. The special effects were absolutely believable, and Peterson piles on the tension even while breaking it up by adding a parallel rescue at the same time as the Andrea Gail begins to run into trouble.  An excellent summer thriller that is a real roller coaster ride--literally and figuratively--on water.

Convinced that it is his turn to score the big haul, Tyne convinces his crew to go on one last run before the end of the season and heads for the North Atlantic.  He never figured Mother Nature into his plans.I remember reading about the Andrea Gail soon after The Storm of the Century hit the eastern seaboard.  It was only a matter of time before someone tried to bring this story to the big screen.  Thankfully, it was Wolfgang Petersen who did so - here he does for fishing what he did for submarine warfare in Das Boot - puts the viewer in the midst of the action and scares the hell out of them.I can say without exaggeration that I have never experienced a movie as stressful as this one (the friend I brought to the premiere was literally ill).  The movie starts out slowly and deliberately, gradually setting the stage for what is about to come.  Petersen utilizes several subplots to build the suspense initially he focuses on the disappointment of the crew as they repeatedly fail to hit the motherlode.  Masterfully intercut with this are scenes documenting an idyllic sailing trip that turns ugly, and the Coast Guard attempts to rescue them.   Consequently, the tension, like the storm, continues to build to a crescendo, and never wanes.  The movie also feels real.I have been in twenty-foot seas once in my life, and that was more than enough for me (it was one of the few times I ever contemplated my own mortality).  Watching this movie brought it all back the waves looked so real that it is often difficult to differentiate between the CGI and the real thing.   Also, I could feel the waves as they pounded relentlessly against the boat (the theatre I saw this in had a great sound system) and was deafened by the shrieking wind.  The experience, is, for lack of a better word, ferocious -  I kept everything to disintegrate in the onslaught.  However, special effects alone do not adequately convey the appropriate sense of danger.Many of the water scenes were actually shot in heavy seas - they managed to film in the tail end of a hurricane - adding to the realism (several members of the crew were regularly feeding the fish...). The actors faced additional dangers - Mark Wahlberg came perilously close to drowning, not once but twice, and was injured by one of the animatronic creatures.   Anyone expecting Clooney or Wahlberg to be glamorous will be sorely disappointed - they are earthy, and scraggly.  But more importantly, their performances ring true.  Indeed, all of the main characters deliver subtle, believable performances.I have never given a strong endorsement with an equally strong caveat - you must see this movie, but only if you can handle stress.  And yes I am serious on both counts.

Even on several viewings, the film never betrays a moment that is false, maudlin, or sentimental. The plot is not what keeps people engaged during this film. It is the issue. How do people face death? In this film, the people are the captain and crew of the boat. They know their job, commercial fishing, is difficult and dangerous, even in good weather. The weather is rainy. The men need the money. They go out even though they know they will meet a storm. They are used to risking their lives every day. Few people appreciate how dangerous it is to deliver that fish entrée to the table.The storm turns into a hurricane that traps the men, plays rough with them, and kills them. They struggle to save their own lives. They fail. When they are neck deep in water in a compartment of the overturned boat, they face death squarely. They talk, briefly, and unsentimentally, about things they will not be able to do, people they will miss. The stark, plainness of the acting achieves a powerful emotional effect.At the beginning of the film, the viewer meets the crew. On multiple viewings, the film reveals nothing milked -- nothing artificial. The men are solid, working people. There is no sappy foreshadowing.Director deserves kudos, for maintaining tight-fisted control of a vehicle that could have been campy, or worse.The viewer will learn a lot about meteorology, especially about hurricanes. The special effects are indistinguishable from live action.All the actors, including George Clooney, maintain a stoic, engagement with life, and they struggle to live, with no appeal to our pity, until they die.The Perfect Storm is more than a film. It is a parable.

Director Wolfgang Peterson has deftly crafted an intense rendering of the story of the Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat captained by Billy Tyne that left Gloucester, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1991, and soon encountered the storm of the century.  After a less than profitable trip out, Captain Tyne (George Clooney) sets out again in October, with a crew of five men, and heads for deep water and a place know as the `Flemish Cap.'  It's a dangerous trek for that time of year, but he assures his men that the catch will be worth the risk.  What he could not foresee, however (nor could any meteorologist), was that three major storms would converge to form a single storm, the likes of which comes along only once in every one hundred years or so.  Fate steps in further when, after their catch is made, their ice making machine burns out, leaving them without the means of packing and preserving the fish.  They have no choice but to go back in, directly through the storm, lest the fish spoil, in which case all of their work, and the risks taken, would be for naught.  Tyne lets the crew decide; do they turn away and wait out the storm, losing everything, or do they prove that they're `Gloucestermen,' and try to make it back. 	What Peterson did with this film, the way he tells the story, can be likened to what Melville did with the novel, `Moby Dick;' as it moves along, he fleshes out the characters and subtly provides an intimate portrait of what this kind of life is all about.  He pays such meticulous attention to details, that by the time you're in the middle of the storm, the impact is extraordinary; you know what this boat is and how it works, you've smelled the fish and the sweat and the sea, and worked alongside the crew.   You know these people and what's at stake here.  You know the feel of the fishing lines and the grappling hooks, felt that rush of adrenaline that comes when you hook a big one, or when a huge wave washes over the deck.  He gives you so much in this film, puts you in it so completely, that it primes your senses for whatever's to come.  Combine all of this with the best special effects imaginable, outstanding performances, and a terrific score by John Horner, and you're in for the thrill of a lifetime. 	The charismatic Clooney is exemplary here as Tyne; he knows him from the inside out, which enables him to convey a real sense of who this man is.  And it shows in the way he carries himself, the way he walks and talks, right down to the look in his eye.  He's tough without any unwarranted theatrics or bravura, is self-assured, but aware of his own shortcomings, as well.  It's a commanding performance with nuance and depth; It's all there, and Clooney makes it real.  Mark Wahlberg, also, is outstanding as Bobby Shatford, the rookie fisherman who can't stand to be more than two feet away from the woman he loves, Christina (Diane Lane).  Lane gives a notable performance here, too, as does John C. Reilly, who does an emotional turn as `Murph,' the veteran fisherman with a young son he loves, and who lives with the remorse of past mistakes that cost him his wife. 	Rounding out the exceptional supporting cast are William Fichtner (Sully), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Linda), Allen Payne (Alfred), John Hawkes (Bugsy) and Michael Ironside (Bobby Brown).  There are thrills and heroics to spare in `The Perfect Storm,' but it's also inspiring; once you've seen the Coast Guard in action, for example, you'll never take them for granted again.  What makes this such a great movie, though, is that it's about real people, doing their jobs and going about living their lives like we all do.  It's an instance of ordinary people getting caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and Peterson has made them accessible, ones with whom anyone in the audience will be able to identify.  This is an emotionally charged, unforgettable film; you'll experience things from the comfort of your seat in the theater (or on the couch) that most people will never get close to in real life.  And therein lies the true magic of the cinema.  This is one movie you absolutely do not want to miss. 10/10.

Ordinarily I would write a review that is fair minded and as honest as I can call it, something that hopefully would interest the readers either side of the fence. But here with The Perfect Storm I just want to write why I love this particular picture, and what a most divisive picture it has turned out to be. I'm aware of the complaints about the movie, even the ones from the family of the real Captain Billy Tyne played by Alpha Male regular George Clooney, but as an entertaining spectacle with huge slices of emotional fortitude, The Perfect Storm will forever be hitting my spots. The character build up is just wonderful, people with things to prove, fractured and blossoming romances, loyalties on the line, grudges carried over from previous encounters, the lives of sea fishermen fully formed in the films first quarter. Then there is a sequence as George Clooney says the monologue that I have opened this review with, beautifully recited, but it's the emotion in Linda Greenlaw's face (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) as she watches and listens to him speak it, just wonderful. Then the boys go out to see, heading off into dangerous waters to hopefully make a killing in the fish market, tensions run high, accidents happen, heroes are born and rivalries quickly overturned, but the boys must go further if they are to corner the market, the Grand Banks are evil at this time of year. A three pronged hostile weather front is heading their way, they are, as Linda tells Billy on the radio, heading into the belly of the monster, and what a monster it is. Here the makers excel, director Wolfgang Petersen, his cinematographer John Seale and his S/E maestro John Frazier do literally put me right there in a amongst the waves and derringdo bravado. Then it's the final couple of reels, the emotional mangler, even a spiritual coda that is hated by so many can't make me dislike the film any less, and I'll wager right here and now that as funeral eulogies go, few if any have been delivered with as much heartbreaking emotion as the one read by Mastrantonio here. All of which is backed by a truly involving score by James Horner, shades of Braveheart's emotional swirls in there. It's a personal opinion you know, but The Perfect Storm is a magnificent film that I enjoy three times a year, every year, and nobody will ever be able to take that away from me.

Twister had ok fx, but a horrible script. Volcano was boring. Dante's Peak was ok, but inaccurate. Armageddon was also way too unbelievable and inaccurate, and wouldn't happen the way it did, but it was still funny. I guess the only other disaster flick that's pretty equal to 'Storm' is Deep Impact, on some occasions.But enough about other movies. This one is based on a true story, as we're told. So, like most other Americans, I was not aware of the facts that surround this film, and didn't know what to expect at the end. Without spoiling too much, I'll say I was very surprised, but also very relieved that it was believable. Check out The Perfect Storm, best disaster movie ever.

AND - I was already past 65 when this happened! Indeed, I am ancient, although I think like a teenager. I was shopping in Ralph's market and saw the VHS on a stand. I had seen the movie in the theater; I didn't hesitate to buy it, and then went right out to a store and bought a VCR. Almost everyone who commented on this movie saw it in a theater.I digress I suppose not too many people have seen the ocean when it gets to be as furious like in The Perfect Storm. I am a native of the Gulf Coast; my friends and I couldn't wait till the hurricane season started, because we'd flock to the beach for swimming......such deep water ! That was before the weather went crazy and the hurricanes have become such monsters. So, I have a little more insight about what a perfect storm could be like - I would also like to say you can't get me on the ocean now-a-days - this movie vividly demonstrates you can't mess with Mother nature (some folk admitted that). You saw in this film that no matter how large a ship is, the water is stronger and certainly unpredictable. That first ship you saw was a tanker about as big as a football-field - the second, maybe bigger......loaded with containers. If you haven't been to a port to witness how large these ships are, then you certainly have no business trying to critique a movie about the ocean. A lot of people mentioned The Titanic - it was a small ship, compared to today's; The Queen Mary is permanently docked at Long Beach, and you'd be surprised how small IT is. The QM-2 recently docked along-side of it (2006), which made it look like a skiff. Not yet, but eventually one of the super cruise-ships will sink (Poseidon Adventure) and the world will be shown you take your life in your own hands by venturing out onto the oceans. Remember The Andrea Doria?Now, think about people who sail on those boats from the East Coast just about every day to fish for a living. If you think the North Atlantic is bad, the ships that fish in the North Pacific close to Alaska are immense. Yet, they are constantly sinking; the pay is so high for the men who work on these ships, they feel they'll do one season of fishing and make enough money to get on their feet - and they're right.I suppose those who were so terribly disappointed in the cast of The Perfect Storm were expecting some heavy acting, maybe people in evening-clothing, highly emotionally sensational lines. Guess What! The actors/actresses in this film were perfect, because they ARE working, not having a party. The folk left at home are terrified, because they know the danger of sailing on the seas. What ordinary people don't realize is, we've killed all the fishing-grounds along our country's coasts, and the ships DO have to sail halfway to the next continent to make a catch. So, the next time you eat a tasty crab-leg from Alaska, just keep in mind that someone was scared to death catching it.The Perfect Storm story set-up was extremely believable. The fishermen who work on the boats are not always compatible and they do not always get along, except when emergencies surface. The beating the Andrea Gail took as soon as the storm began was very believable.If you'd read more of the trivia section, you'd know that some of the scenes were shot ON THE FRINGES of hurricane Floyd - all of it wasn't done in that huge tank. The circular motion of winds in a hurricane DO make for huge waves that collide into one another, not long lines of high water. Again, if you haven't actually witnessed a hurricane, don't write like you're an expert - sitting in a theater doesn't give you expertise to do this. Sorry you spent your $8.00 to see the movie, but it was your decision - no one guaranteed you were going to like the movie.......So, folk you need to give this movie a break. Yes, The Coast Guard does make actual rescues in the ocean; consider how many they've rescued between Florida and Cuba and Haiti. The scene in The Perfect Storm was brilliant. And, George Clooney and Wahlberg were perfect for their roles, because they were portraying NORMAL people. Wolfgang Peterson did a great job with William Wittliff's script. I also saw Das Boot when it was first released, but I didn't faint when I learned Peterson had directed them both. In fact, there were parts of Das Boot I didn't enjoy, like guys puking on themselves - but, that's the way sailors are, huh? I now have The Boat and enjoy is thoroughly.I loved Murph and Mastrantonio's character - also Sully. I just got the DVD for this movie and watched it earlier tonight. It's got my 10, because it never fails to frighten me. Whatever Oscars it won, they were deserved. Folk who know nothing about the ocean and the risks people who sail it daily, they should definitely watch this movie....then give thanks and respect to those who WORK it daily....and gave their lives.....we're on dry land. Bravo! for The Perfect Storm....9/28/06 - I watched the special features tonight to those who made comments about 'throwing a little water on them should really watch them. Most of those scenes were shot on a fantastic stage with a huge tank of water, with machines that make the boats pitch, etc. So, all of the cast who were on the Andrea Gail were in great danger, not just one time but for the duration of the filming.

Based on a true story with a storm that is beyond perfect. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and a host of other fishermen journey to the Atlantic to catch fish but upon their way back they are caught within a massive storm. Cliché filled bore directed by Wolfgang Petersen who previously made another laugh rendered action farce called Air Force One. Terrific special effects are only plus but the cast basically sleepwalk through the entire film. Clooney, Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, and Diane Lane are at the mercy of special effects and none of it is very remarkable. There is a vague subplot that involves William Fichtner as a former lover to the John C. Reilly character's wife but it really doesn't matter. This film exists purely for its production values despite its ad campaign boasting its true story bases. It is nearly two hours of torture watching these fisherman meet their death. What is the sense in that? All this work within a screenplay that isn't worth a dime of it. The best way to deal with a film of this disappointing nature is to flush it down the toilet so that it may ride the waves it deserves.

Movie lovers searching for more gripping drama need to look elsewhere; this one is about special effects - period. But that is not to say that the movie does not offer any insights on the backgrounds of its main characters. Indeed, it does that, but has chosen to capitalize more on the wizardry of its FX folks.The story is based on a true incident in 1991 The Northeaster, or `storm of the century,' and how it hits the fishing boat, Andrea Gail. But there are other isolated incidents on the side that create enough suspense on their own; like the rescue of the smaller sail boat and its three-person crew by the Coast Guard.George Clooney looks tough as the skipper of the boat. He even sacrifices some of his good looks for the sake of the role - a slight beard this time. He looks convincing as the obstinate captain who is determined first to go to the troubled waters to catch more fish, and then to brave the storm once fate befalls it on him and his crew.Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane star as the two lovers who are separated by the ocean between them. While she is waiting for him, he is determined to side with his skipper in his time of adversity. Mary Stuart Mastrantonio, who is on another boat, plays Clooney's friend, and is trying desperately to get him to change his course.The only scene that I recall as being unnecessary in this one, is the copy cat of  `Jaws', where a shark enters the fray of the catch amidst all the sword fish, and attacks one of the crew members. Barring this shot of the director at cheap thrills, everything else is in its place, and knows when to explode and when to be serene - pretty much like the ocean itself.Director, Wolfgang Peterson, has other blockbuster hits to his name such as Das Boot, In the Line of Fire, Air Force One, etc., but this one leaves them all way behind.Too many scenes in this movie make you sit up in your seat, but my favorite is the 50-ft. wave at the end.

All of the actors are perfect for their roles. Not only do they relate to real-life working people, but the portray them with dignity and nobility. Most of the negative reviewers probably never lifted anything heavier than a phone book, and don't know the meaning of sweat, blood and real work. As for comments about stupid actions of the captain, let me ask some of these people have you ever driven in a snowstorm to get home? Certainly, so why denigrate the captain here? This is not the kind of movie for actors like Ralph Fiennes or Hugh Grant. This is the niche of George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. The two female leads (Diane Lane and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are also outstanding. I am glad they did not cast Michelle Pfeiffer or some overly pretty actress in these roles. About the only quibble I have with the film are the fishes. The shark looks suspiciously like the one in Deep Blue Sea. When he bites Mark, the foot should have come off. The jaw strength of a shark is incredibly powerful, and its action is very swift. The animatronic swordfish had too much sheen and didn't twist erratically enough. Rent or buy the film and don't spend too much time over-analyzing it.

It looked like big, fun entertainment and I am a huge fan of Wolfgang Petersen. The Perfect Storm definitely delivers entertainment, and while it may not be Petersen's best, I enjoyed myself.The plot tells the story of the Andrea Gail, which is shown in the beginning moments as coming in from a trip at sea, carrying with it a load of fish that is less than satisfying to the owner of the boat. This puts the boat's captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney), under the added pressure of making a better catch the next trip. He is soon given an ultimatum he must leave on a trip the following day and bring back a bigger catch if he wants to keep his position as captain. So it's off to sea again for the crew, but not before we are given a warming glance at each one's life on land. Their luck looks like it's running out, so they venture further out into the Atlantic to increase their find. While they are at sea, three storm systems, one of which is a hurricane, begin to move towards one another, and will soon collide directly in the path of the Andrea Gail's return back to port. Tyne gives his crew a choice they can run away from the storm, or head right into it and attempt to make it back home. The stand-out performers are Mark Wahlberg (who, sadly, is apparently going to be a Razzie front-runner this year for this very film) and George Clooney, they show us better skills than they did in Three Kings, and Diane Lane and John C. Reilly make for a lovely supporting cast. The script is adapted from Sebastian Junger's excellent novel, and it matches up to its quality. All these things are good, but it is the visual effects that are really the best thing about the movie. We are thrown violently into the heart of the storm, first in a toe-clenchingly exciting matter, but near the end of the film, it becomes tiring to watch Clooney and co. continuously  scream at the raging water, but there is still a lot of engaging thrills to make up for it.Some strong, unpredictable entertainment for audiences who aren't easily seasick.I rate The Perfect Storm 7 out of 10.

I remember thinking how i didn't really want to see the movie until the huge 100 foot wave at the end with the boat barely hanging on for dear life. This is the money. Almost every special effects movie has one. Independence Day had the white house explosion, Godzilla had the big lizard goot stepping on the cameraman, and now vertical limit has someone jumping from one mountain to another. These images make you want to see the film and in the case of the perfect storm it was my only reason.I have to say the movie isn't bad at all. it's Just not the action packed extravaganza that the trailer promised and that's ok because now we get to experience the tragic story of the andrea gail and its crew. The first 45 minutes is the set up of the characters. The characters aren't throughly developed enough but that doesn't mean we dont care about them. What might be disappointing for the viewer is that we know how the film will end so even if the film presents a chance that the crew might make it we still know that something will get in the way.The special effects are awesome. I will never look at the sea the same way again. when at its angriest the sea can become a beast and a force to be reckoned with.The acting is pretty good from all the actors. clooney and wahlbergs characters are the most developed and they also give the best performances but the best performance is by the sea itself.As for the money shot. it was satisfying and intense. it stands out as one of the best effects shots caught on camera in my opinon.By the end however i was left with a weird feeling. i saw this movie based on its special effects and action but by the end i felt for the characters and my heart really went out to the real people. so the film wanted us to feel for the characters it won me over.

ILM have done an incredible job with the water and ships. There is a stunning brutal beauty to all of their shots not to mention an eerie realism. Perfect Storm takes a while to get going but unlike Twister once it starts it's a ride of pure tension and excitement. As weather movies go, this is a damn good one (except for the last 10 mins!).

Never had such a meteorological event occurred.Much has been written about this film's special effects in their portrayal of the stormy seas, and these effects are truly incredible.  Perhaps more importantly, the film follows Junger's book in its portrayal of Gloucester and its community A one industry town, where the residents feel obligated to the incredibly dangerous deep-sea fishing industry, even though they have lost so many of their citizens.The cast is solid Clooney fits well as Billy Tyne, the Andrea Gail's captain, and although he doesn't have a New England accent, there isn't much lost in that.  Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane are both very good as the only characters with any romance in their lives, and we truly feel the love and hope that they have for each other.  John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, and the ever-tough Michael Ironside (is he EVER a good guy ?) round out the cast.Junger's book was a fascinating and important story to tell, and Petersen has directed a fine film about man's battle against the sea and its consequences.

Let's start with the special effects.  Back in the early days of CGI it was easy to tell what was, and what wasn't.  Digital effects have come a long way since then.  The computer allows for the storm to become a big digital monster.  It is like a full-blown character created by the computer, like Jar Jar Binks.  The musical score by James Horner is spectacular.  I believe it to be the best musical score of the year so far.  The Perfect Storm is an amazing story which will keep your eyes glued and your hands clutched to the arm rests.The Perfect Storm is not perfect though.  I'm sorry, I had to.

A great idea, good casting, a great screenplay, good direction, acting, editing, sound and visual effects sometimes come together and we see a perfect movie.  The perfect movie did not happen in 2000, but `The Perfect Storm' although not a perfect movie is a worthy effort.  Don't go to see good acting or hear exciting dialogue.  George Clooney is as bad as ever and the supporting cast isn't good.  The special effects are perfect!  The scenes on the sailboat, abroad the Coast Guard cutter, on the helicopter are movie equivalent of shear terror.  The scenes on the Andrea Gail (the real life swordfish boat that was lost in the perfect storm of 1991) are perfect special effects.  There is one scene where the camera pans away from the Andrea Gail as it attempts to ride over a huge breaking wave.  I'd say the scene looked `realistic' but how would I know; I've never been on a fishing boat during a hurricane.  I'll say the scene looked really convincing.  Enough so, that I hope I'm never at sea on a small boat in any kind of storm, perfect or otherwise.  Don't wait to see this movie on television.  See the special effects on a big screen.

The carry over chemistry from Three Kings between Whalberg and Clooney is magic. It is rare when you truly see two actors really connect the way they do and it can only be seen with careful attention. To make this movie shine like a star Wolfgang needed more character development. But since this was slated to be a summer movie, and as we know summer movies rarely dig deeper than a Colorado detective with a fresh cup of coffee, I felt satisfied with its presentation. There was so much within the characters that only scratched the surface of the pain and frustration they have all dealt with in their lives.

Hollywood makes these movies or forces Directors to cut down their movies to these types of films for.....stupid audiences. An Example is Contact.

It has great special effects a nearlyperfect soundmix(I hope that these two will get a  nomination) on the technical side and a good cast. Everybody saying that this movie is boring has either watched abootleg copy on his cheesy VCR or saw it in a very low-tech Cinema. In this case I guess that every Action-Drama could be considered as boring. Maybe some of you will laugh but I also hope that the Director will get a nomination. It was far more shocking and realistic than Spielberg's work on 'Saving'. And that's what this film is all about. Spielberg is a Master in directing Popcorn flicks. But when it comes to more serious topics he fails. 'Schindlers list'(although a very good film) was full of stereotypes(even against Jews) as was 'Saving'. Petersen can do Popcorn-Flicks(Outbreak, Air Force One) and serious Character-Films(In the line of Fire, Das Boot).

Unlike its overdramatized, overpublicized predecessors (and I believe we can all think of one perfect example), the film makes a valiant effort to remain faithful to the factual events that inspired it. Its shining glory is the authenticity of the famous Bostonian accents on the parts of the actors, notably the character of Bobby Shatford, the astounding portrayal of whom nearly eliminates from memory the loudmouthed rapper who once called himself Marky Mark. Indeed, fairly authentic accents can also be heard from William Fichtner (Sully), John C. Reilly (Murph), and John Hawkes (Bugsy). Honorable mention goes to Karen Allen (Christina), who, when listened to carefully, would sometimes throw a hint of Brooklyn into the works. Having said that, however, having been born and raised in Boston, I bristled a bit at the fact that the character of Skipper Billy Tyne, played by George Clooney, showed no trace of the local dialect whatsoever, when his comment about skating on a nearby pond as a child clearly labels him as a native. It's possible that the character of Tyne simply chooses to carefully monitor his speech, or perhaps that director Wolfgang Petersen chose to portray Tyne in this light to make him appear more intelligent as compared to the locals. More than likely, Clooney simply just couldn't find the time in his busy schedule to attend speech training.As a trained actress, I don't take much enjoyment out of criticizing films, which are my first true love, but rather focusing on the positive points of the movie. With that in mind, I'd also like to comment on the very ending. (NOTE If you have not seen this movie and don't know how it ends, and don't want to know, DON'T read any further!! Consider yourself warned.) Another thing that sets this film apart from its predecessors, such as -- I must use this example -- Titanic, The Perfect Storm makes no attempt at long, drawn-out poignant goodbyes and pathetic death scenes. Murph's final words This is gonna be hard on my boy. As for Bobby's parting, one can hear nothing but the crashing fury of the raging sea surrounding him and a touching inner monologue directed towards his beloved Christine -- one she later recounts in a dream. One thing the film does share with the cinematic juggernaut, however, is an Oscar-worthy musical score by composer James Horner. And so the audience heaves a collective sigh of relief as we are allowed a few poignant tear-jerking moments in the form of a well-written eulogy and a brief final shot of the departed a la Armageddon. Amen, friends. This is the true glory of the cinema.

Computer digital effects have never truly impressed me since Jurassic Park, no major foward steps have been made since then. Until now, the clouds, the waves, the spray, while of course not totally believable, were jaw dropping, amazing, and in context with the storyline, terrifying. Once that storm kicks in its just drawdropping and I was terrified, and suspended... that boat, those waves, you just have to see it, on the big screen believe me, it is truly freaky stuff. And Peterson can handle the action scenes, such as the piece with the out of control anchor, and lets not forget the Coastguard scenes, never before have I seen people, and their technology, so frail, compared to the raw power of nature.Yes, some of the dialouge is truly banal, the character situations such as the feud between two of the fishermen, and again, thrills are along time in the coming, but when they come, they come, and the development at the start does come in handy, these are after all real characters, and despite some two-dimensionality, we must sub-consciously feel for them, and their plight. To know it is true, that makes it all the more moving, and all the more scary.On the other hand, when the credits began to roll, and the lights came up, my friend beside me said Didn't that suck. So there you go.

Anyone who proceeds to watch this film hoping to see top notch acting....please don't go to see it.  It was a wonderful film which doesn't need to be criticized in that way and should be left alone.People who said that there was no human interest in this film should have their head examined.  OK, I will give you that Diane Lane over acted just a tad, and she was kind of annoying, but the movie minimized her appearance, so the fact that she was one of the weaker parts of the movie is cancelled out.  I liked every single member of the crew on the Andrea Gail.  Even Sully who at first was a real jerk.  The key to a movie like this is that you must create likeable characters that the audience can root for to beat the storm.  Peterson did that.  Even though George Clooney was a bit like himself (which isn't usually good), he was casted beautifully as Captain Billy Tyne.  The movie was exhausting, and emotionally involving and in my book, the movie has succeeded if that's the way you feel after watching it.For what this movie was intended to do, and the level at which it accomplished its goal......I give The Perfect Storm....4 stars.

He succeeds in almost every sense of the word. Loving attention has been given to the characters, the work of a fisherman, life in Gloucester, and most importantly, to the Storm itself. When you're watching it, you're there, even if the scene consists only of people sitting on stools at the Crow's Nest, talking.  On rare occasions, the dialogue itself seems forced, though, like it's people talking in a movie and not in a bar. A minor detail.Because Storm's creators wanted us to get to know these men and their families well before setting sail, the film takes a long time to really get moving. Once it does, though, you're grateful you know them as well as you do. The swordfishing scenes--if these guys never swordfished before, which most of them probably have not, I couldn't tell (Markie Mark pulling the insides out of a big swordfish is about as shocking as a movie gets)--shooting in Gloucester, where it all happened, they knew they'd never be allowed to fake it.Whether it was intentional I have no idea, but what Petersen brings across with the Andrea Gail crew is a sense of true displacement--the overwhelming feeling that you're supposed to be somewhere else. We've all been in these situations, though none as perilous as this one. It's like leaving for work, getting halfway there, and realizing you've forgotten the report you'd worked for days on and is due today. You have no choice you have to go back and get it and make yourself late for work. You retrieve the report and drive the exact same route back to work and there it is this powerful sense that this is not the way things were supposed to go. The whole day is now thrown off completely.These fishermen are having the ultimate bad day. Their captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney in his best performance ever), has just brought them back from a disappointing two months of fishing. Tyne's boss (Michael Ironside) knows just what buttons to push and convinces Tyne to return to sea. This is an easy decision for Tyne--all he has is the sea. He's divorced and his only love is his job. He'd do it for free. His crew is another story altogether. Sure, they love fishing, but they also need the money desperately. Swordfishing is a gamble. Like many industries, you put in a lot of time and resources into it, making many sacrifices, without knowing what the return will be. Tyne's &#145;no guts, no glory'-type speech convinces them to go along for the ride again--only days after they've returned from the last run.From the beginning of their journey, the crew members pour the pressure on their captain to make it worth their while. This is a last-minute, unplanned trip. They're not supposed to be there. Before the storm even hits, the bad karma surrounds them like fog besides having even worse luck catching swordfish than their last run, one bizarre small disaster after another happens along the way. This approach is what makes William Wittliff's script so great. He uses these incidents to build the intensity, capping it off with the famed super-storm.I can honestly say that this is the best work I've ever seen from ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). Never have special effects been more crucial to a story and executed so effectively. The storm scenes--when the lightning flashes, briefly revealing mountains of black waves--are at once beautiful and terrifying.Petersen brings it all together nicely. He puts his characters (and from what I've heard, his actors as well) through hell. As the voyage takes a turn from being an ill-advised journey to transport 64,000 pounds of swordfish back across the Atlantic to being a desperate struggle for survival, you can see it on the characters' faces they've never been this close to death--and they're loving every minute of it. How can we not do the same? The best way to pay homage I can think of.Grade A-  "},{"Title":"spoiler I tell the ending","Date":"4 July 2000","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  Warning a spoiler I tell the ending.

What makes this film interesting is they turn the boat around and try to save there lives.

This description may conjure memories of the brain-dead dramatics of Twister, but this picture delivers  honest, emotional thrills with a minimum of Hollywood prettification.  It helps, of course, that the events on the screen really happened.In 1991, the Andrea Gail, a boat from the centuries-old fishing hamlet of Gloucester, Massachussetts, had fallen on hard times.  Their catch was low, the crew suffering.  Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) decided to take them out on one last run for the season, to a distant, ultra-fertile fishing ground known as the Flemish Cap.  Unbeknownst to the Andrea Gail's crew, however, a hurricane from Bermuda was on a collision course with a New England storm system and a Canadian cold front that meteorologists were to call the perfect storm.  And the Andrea Gail sailed right into it.These events, drawn from Sebastian Junger's non-fiction bestseller, are dramatized with a respectful straightforwardness by Petersen.  Screenwriter Bill Wittliff does dish up some overripe dialogue (You're sailing right into the middle of the monster!), but the essential drama of a stubborn captain who refuses to say die in the face of insurmountable odds is right out of Moby-Dick, and it works pretty well here, too.  The melodrama is largely confined to the shore, where the sailors' wives and girlfriends are stuck awaiting news of the foundering fishing boat.  A subplot involving Mark Wahlberg, one of the sailors, and his girlfriend (Diane Lane) is particularly treacly, and could have been handled more realistically to better effect.  On the boat, however, the drama is rock-bottom realistic.  The fisherman's bloody, dirty, difficult life is not given short shrift, and some of the film's most interesting passages feature  the fishermen doing what they do best  fishing.  The actors, including the amiable John C. Reilly and the gruffly charming John Hawkes, are just fine as the crew, but George Clooney is something more.  This is perhaps the finest acting of his cinema career, as he nails the near-obsessive love of the sea endemic to the career sailor.  Clooney's piercing eyes and commanding voice make us believe that Billy Tyne would aim his boat into the heart of a storm just because that's where the fish are.Of course, there are the storm scenes, and this film will likely be adorning its mantel with a visual effects Oscar come March.  The visuals of destruction at sea are seamlessly convincing and really quite frightening, and John Seale's hand-held cinematography lets us feel every pitch and toss of the boat.  The editing is whiplash-quick, the soundtrack roars with wind and waves, the lightning flashes, and it works.I will not reveal the fate of the Andrea Gail here (of course, anyone who's read the book already knows it), but The Perfect Storm is a fitting testament to all the working men of the world who have risked life and limb to make our lives easier or happier.  And just to put it all in perfect perspective, the film is dedicated To the ten thousand Gloucestermen who have lost their lives at sea since 1623.

The rest of the cast isn't really given much to do - they sit and look anxious and scream or cry or both occasionally, but not much beyond that.The film's biggest flaw is important but not fatal.  The very chaos of a hurricane that has been so effectively recreated here has a tendency to make the action hard to follow at times, especially during the sequences involving the Coast Guard helicopter and its crew.  There's no real way to tell these characters apart, and that makes it somewhat difficult to develop much interest in what happens to them.  Furthermore, the Coast Guard sequences mostly just serve to intrude upon the story and characters we really care about, the Andrea Gale and her crew.It's too bad, because the stuff aboard the swordboat is pretty good.

It is heavily laced with special-effects, and has to maintain our interest in its characters and plot while we wait for these effects to appear.  It does actually accomplish this task pretty well.  On a smaller scale however, it risks being tagged as exploiting a local tragedy for financial gain.  Everyone knows that the movie focuses heavily on the events leading up to the loss of the Andrea Gail, a Gloucester swordfishing boat, at sea during the cataclysmic storm caused by Hurricane Grace in 1991.        As someone who did not grow up in Gloucester and had friends or family who fished for a living, I cannot say how it would feel to see this movie in that light.  I can say that from the perspective of an outsider, I came out of this movie with a greater understanding, if not a respect for the tenacity with which people will fight for their lives in unbearable conditions, and the bravery that can result.  If that is not a tribute, than at least it is a compliment.   The movie stars George Clooney, as Billy Tyne, captain of the Andrea Gail.  He is disappointed with the slump his catch has been in lately, and enjoys a friendly rivalry with another successful captain played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantoinio, who is probably the closest thing to a love interest he could have in his life.  He is dedicated to fishing however, and although the season is all but over, he decides to go out one last time to the far reaches of the ocean to redeem himself.   His crew, put together of the usual ragtag bunch, is not happy to be putting out again so soon but they reluctantly go along with it when he promises them the best catch they've ever had.  Bobby Shatford (Wahlberg) is dating a recently divorced woman (Diane Lane) who lives above the local bar and is sorry to leave her behind, but as he puts it, then again, I love to fish.  The other members of the crew all have their own personal issues to leave ashore, including Murph, who suffered a difficult divorce and estrangement from his son.  Bugsy attempts to pick up a local woman who resists his charms at first but slowly warms to him, and appears on dock to wave him off.  These issues are all put aside once the men set out to sea.  Billy Tyne wants to go all the way past the Grand Banks to the Flemish Cap, where the fish are; their abundance explained mainly, I gathered, because few fishermen will travel that far.  This leads to their being on the outskirts of what proves to be the biggest storm on record, due to a collision between three already dangerous storms.  It occurs right in the path the Andrea Gail must take to get back, and when the ice machine breaks down and time is of the essence, the crew makes this decision based on their belief that they can handle it.  They are wrong, of course.  But no one truly understood ahead of time how bad the storm would be, and when their antenna blows off, communication is lost.  The movie intercuts scenes aboard the Andrea Gail with those of a wealthy sailboat owner who takes his family out on a trip to Bermuda and is resistant to advice to turn around when the storm hits.  A Coast Guard rescue attempt is made, and another, ill-fated one is attempted for the Andrea Gail as well.  What the movie does is tell the story of what is known about the Andrea Gail and add dramatic developments.  Two of Tyne's fishing crew are at odds with each other for reasons I still don't quite understand, and Wahlberg is motivated by a need for cash to support his girlfriend's custody battle for her children.  The personalities of the men play off each other, but when the storm hits and situation is grim, all that matters is the weary struggle to stay alive in impossible conditions.  In the midst of the storm we get visuals of remarkable impact; of powerful winds whipping mist across the whitecaps, tremendous swells and the tiny fishing vessel being tossed across them, and it all looked real enough to me.  I believed it when Clooney climbed out on a wildly swaying beam to cut the chain tying the anchor that swung dangerously about in the gale, and the now-famous shot of the Gail climbing up the side of a monstrous wave, is very effective as well.  The wave was created using computer generated images after researching extensively how ocean water behaves in such conditions, but I wasn't thinking that when I saw it.  Purists may find that the Gloucester in the movie contains only a handful of recognizable locations, and seems to sprawl more than at least I remember it, having spent some time there during college.  What is believable is how the locals gather around the TV in the tavern to watch the weather reports; this is pretty much how I would imagine they would react.  And I liked the little details the movie offers about how the swordfishing business works, and the remorse the boat's owner (Michael Ironside) displays when it appears to be lost.   The movie will not generate much suspense for New Englanders about the fate of the Andrea Gail, but it does do a convincing job of telling its story with grace and dignity for its crew.  I was reminded of another weather-related special-effects movie, Twister which consisted of one convincing tornado after another with almost no substance in between.  I felt more strongly about the characters in Perfect Storm and cared about what happened to them.  In a way, that's a tribute in itself.

There are many different area of the storm seen including a daring Coast Guard rescue. This film just hits you almost non stop and just when you thinks it's over, it's hits you hard, real hard. The Perfect Storm gets a 10. It's a film that goes out and does what it's suppose to do, get likeable characters across to the audience, have some good dialogue, and thrill the theater so much that everyone comes out feeling sea sick. This a film that *MUST* be seen in the theater for full enjoyment. The Perfect Storm is, dare I say, a perfect film.

Luckily, I did not have to pay to see it.)Everyone in Perfect Storm is miserable.  The fishermen, their women, the townsfolk, the Coast Guard, the AUDIENCE.The film begins with the return of the rugged-looking but angst-ridden crews of two fishing boats to a small (Hollywood-envisioned) New England port. One crew, led by a haggard looking female captain (played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio,) was successful; the other, led by a brooding and ill-kempt Captain Billy(George Clooney) failed to catch a good haul and is in deep trouble (but not as much as the script!).Soon, we meet members of the fishing crew. Their personal issues.  What they've given up for their love of the sea. Their long-suffering women-folk. We are confronted with overly dramatic monologues on the nobility of seafaring. Over-the-top dialogue is turned a notch-up by overer-the-top acting.Everyone looks terribly grungy.  Apparently the Gillette reinforcement ship was sunk in an earlier storm, as scraggly beards are donned by everyone in town and on either boat  (except the lady captain who simply wears no make up).As Clooney's boat departs for its next catch fish or be damned mission, the townsfolk give an oddly heroic, teary sendoff.  It's as if eveyone knows what's going to happen in the film as well as in the audience.   Which begs the question..so WHY GO, Dummies?It worsens.  The weather, and the plot.  Contrived hassles between crewmates.  Hokey Jaws-like shipboard (yes-shipboard!) shark attacks... faulty radio equipment and missed warning calls.   Ignored radar images of the approaching storm.The film smells worse than the fish spoiling in the hold of the leaky vessel.  Too late for an S O S.    Let it sink!

So,to me,The perfect storm comes on a bit like a wet Western with the good guys taking on the ultimate bad guy but losing out.Not something Howard Hawks would have approved of. The saloon bar,the cattle boss,the women who wait,Miss Mastrontio playing the saloon girl who wants to be one of the boys - very familiar stuff indeed I'm afraid. Mr Clooney's designer stubble doesn't suit him,I'm pretty sure he'd get more respect if he bothered to shave every morning. The scenes with the yacht in the storm seem totally irrelevant.

Excitement comes at you in waves in PERFECT STORM.","Date":"31 May 2008","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" My Take There is so much to look at in this visually-stunning, special effects-laden disaster drama. THE PERFECT STORM is among the long line of disaster movies hitting beg screens during the 90's to the early 2000's, and like the likes of DEEP IMPACT, TWISTER and DANTE'S PEAK, THE PERFECT STORM is a filler of special effects that make the disaster sequences look real, and indeed, the storm is as perfect as the title suggests. Whether we see strong winds and gigantic flood waves to daring sea rescues, the effects here are the real stars, even if some of the leads include George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg Diane Lane and a dozen others. But really, the star is the storm, since much of the human characters here are cookie-cutter disaster movie material.THE PERFECT STORM is based on an autobiographical novel by Sebastian Junger, but the film is dampened as a cookie-cutter disaster movie that's a little weak on drama, which threatens the film's pacing. The film is quite slow, aiming to create a lot of dramatic scenes with the characters, but they are weak, considering that they are played by top-flight players. The performances are terrific of course, what more could we expect from popular Hollywood names? Although there seemed to be drama going on, it's hardly the film's finest moments.Much of the finest moments however goes to the storm itself. The special effects are marvelous in this film, even by today's standards. It's not as flashy, but that's probably for the best since the effects are need to be more real than cinematic. In fact, the scenes with the storm are more dramatic than any of the scenes with the humans. The scenes involving the daring sea rescues are breathtakingly compelling, and very well done of course. In a way, the storm offers the finest performance of the lot. Overall, the storm is perfect, which might be exactly what you payed for. THE PERFECT STORM exhibits some of the same problems I had with TWISTER. The characters are weak and the plot almost none-existent. But like TWISTER, the movie is worth seeing for the dazzling and seamless special effects, and the ultimate thrills they bring. Rating **** out of 5.

'Decent but unremarkable flick, probably good special effects and lots of actors shouting above crashing waves and whistling winds' &#150; that was the verdict I was expecting to be giving once the film has finished. A couple of hours later I came out of the cinema pleasantly surprised, shaken and moved by the intense and rewarding film I'd just seen. The Perfect Storm is a genuine sleeper &#150; a film much better and more satisfying than you'd expect, which remains in the mind long after you've seen it.In the fishing town of Gloucester on the Atlantic coast of America, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) returns from what should be the final haul of the season with a disappointing catch. He persuades some of the local fishermen to join him for one last trip, a final shot before the season closes at earning enough cash to live comfortably. The crew consists of Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), David Sullivan (William Fichtner), Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes) and Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly). As the sailors set off on their fishing trip, their friends and families wave them off in silent dread, as they do every time they set sail &#150; knowing that their loved ones are at the mercy of Mother Nature on the deep blue ocean. Once they're far out to sea, the guys begin reeling in the fish, but their catch yet again is shaping up to be a disappointment. So Tyne takes them out into the middle of the ocean, the Flemish Cap, where they start catching hundreds of gigantic fish. Meanwhile, two ferocious storms collide behind them, making the journey back perilously dangerous. A third storm changes course and adds to the maelstrom, creating the most intense and powerful storm of the century &#150; the perfect storm, as an excited meteorologist declares. Tyne's crew begin their trip back with a full cargo, but unwittingly sail into the middle of this unimaginable storm. They find themselves and their ship &#150; the Andrea Gail &#150; locked in an incredible struggle to stay afloat, while their loved ones back home wait in anguish for them to return.By and large, The Perfect Storm hits the right notes and emerges an absorbing and involving film. There are occasional moments of awful dialogue &#150; Billy, you're sailing into the middle of the monster! shrieks Mary Elizabeth Mastrantoinio in one particularly awkward scene &#150; but aside from this the film is excellent stuff. The storm scenes are terrifyingly staged and leave one rocking in one's chair, especially on the big screen (see this in a cinema if you can). The story wisely takes its time in the build-up to the storm, sketching in character backgrounds and character relationships so that we actually give a damn about the protagonists. James Horner's music is cleverly used to generate tension and emotion, and Wolfgang Petersen keeps the film low-key but fascinating during the first hour and as intense as possible during its second hour. All in all, a highly impressive and commendable film.

Not content to let the story make it or break it on it's own merit the filmmakers decided to overload the film with typical Hollywood bombast.I might as well begin with the casting. If George Clooney is a Gloucester swordfisherman then I'm the king of Spain. It could've been worse, though; Nicolas Cage was Wolfgang Peterson's first choice. At least the supporting cast has some talented individuals like John C. Reilly and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.I don't know how far the script deviates from the actual occurrences but it's chock full of clichés. Making matters worse is the emotionally manipulative score. As if it wasn't already obvious enough from the bald-faced statements of the characters we have the composer constantly trying to nudge us in the right direction.No doubt the main appeal of the movie is the special effects and while they're pretty good it's hard to care when the rest of the movie seems so laboured. Nevertheless, if all you want is a popcorn-munching waste of time then it's possible that this movie will fit the bill.

Much of the problem for the film comes from the structure and the dialog. The novel had the luxury of giving background on the fishermen and establishing the atmosphere of the town and its history with the sea. It also related the tales of several groups of people trapped within the destructive fury of the storm other than the fishermen. By contrast, the film has limited time to establish the fishermen and their town and the end result is laughably bad dialog that seems lifted from Marlboro Man or Miller Lite commercials. Whenever an obstacle rears its head George Clooney's team leader shouts Are we Gloucestermen? The film focuses almost solely on the fisherman and omits altogether or barely gives a nod to the other people trapped in the storm. Blink and you might well miss Cherry Jones and Karen Allen in thankless roles as some of these survivors. As the focal crew is ill-fated obviously what occurred on the boat in the final hours is supposition. The book took the position that due to the failure of communication it was debatable how much the fishermen knew on the severity of the situation in which they found themselves. By contrast, the film views them as fully aware macho posturers who steam full speed ahead into danger and damn the consequences. They are little more than clichéd peacocks attempting to prove their masculinity and the film ends up trivializing both the men and their lives.Given the thinness of the roles, none of the cast seems able to rise to the occasion. Most of the supporting cast is forgettable. Clooney was still in his head-bob/smirk phase that characterized some of his earlier film work. Mark Wahlberg is probably the most developed of the men, but he runs the gamut of emotions from point A to, well, point A. Meanwhile, back on dry land, the usually reliable Diane Lane (as Wahlberg's girlfriend) turns in an increasingly embarrassing performance which becomes more out of control with each new scene. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio shows up briefly, as a colleague on another boat, to flirt with Clooney and then concludes her performance with a laughably over-the-top hysterical warning to Clooney that rings totally false in its histrionics.The effects are astounding, but one must have a reason to identify and become emotionally involved with the participants (as readers were with the novel from which this came). The film, however, supplies us with cardboard thin, totally unbelievable caricatures that spout inane patter at each other until the effects take over from them. A real let-down.

Unfortunately, he and the script writer opted for cardboard cutouts rather than true character development. Truly a shame as the supporting cast, (with one or two exceptions) was wonderful.First, the film suffered from a lack of focus. Was it an action/adventure film, a character study or a documentary? Since the Andrea Gail and her crew and friends took up most of the screen time, the director would have been better served to eliminate the side stories of the Air National Guard helicopter rescue and the sailing vessel. The actors in those story lines had so little screen time, we never knew who they were nor cared to.My reasoning for the five stars is based totally on the Andrea Gail's crew Reilly, Fichner and Hawkes. Clooney and Wahlberg turned in solid performances - although I think Wahlberg had a better grasp on his character. Mastrantonio spent all her time dining on the scenery (*whoa*) and the usually strong Diane Lane never really caught in her role as the girlfriend.It is the three character actors in the crew who made the film worth watching. Reilly has such a wonderfully live-in face, he's believable from minute one. Fichtner is equally terrific as the crass, short-tempered Sully. (I wonder if the explanation for their mutual dislike ended up on the cutting room floor?) And Hawkes was perfect as the scrawny, worked-hard-all-his-life guy who never gets a break. If Peterson had allowed they guys more screen time, the film would have been the better for it.I won't bother discussing the special effects and the storm. It was all well done, but there was *way* too much of it. Still, worth renting on a slow evening.

The crew of this small vessel had the tragic misfortune of being caught in what meteorologists came to refer to as `The Storm of the Century,' a virtually unprecedented merging of three huge storm systems into a raging, colossal `monster.'The fact that we know the outcome of the story beforehand actually works a bit in the film's favor.  This knowledge adds an air of additional poignancy to what might otherwise be pretty standard, sappy stuff, particularly in the early stretches of the film when we are introduced to the various romantic travails of each of the men on board.  Because we know how it will all end, we are left to muse over the part fate plays in each of our lives.  Of course, this also makes for an intriguing hybrid between fiction and nonfiction since, without surviving eyewitness accounts of the event, most of the details about what actually happened on the boat emerge as pure speculation.The limitation of this type of man-against-nature scenario is that it rarely leaves much time for character development &#150; and `The Perfect Storm' is no exception.  Probably the most well developed figure is that of the boat's captain, Billy Tyne, well played by George Clooney.  Here is a man so obsessed with overcoming his recent fish-catching slump that he ultimately endangers his own life and the lives of his crewmembers to salvage his reputation.  One aspect of the character does strike me as a bit strange, though.  Why does he seem to be the character in the film least informed as to the severity of the storm he is facing?  His competence as a sea captain is brought into question by this fact alone.The other problem is, of course, that, despite the technical brilliance of the special effects, one wave begins to look pretty much like another after awhile &#150; and the characters end up getting lost in the turmoil.  It's true that we don't go to these types of movies for intense character development, but still we crave that little something extra that would lighten some of the dramatic tedium that eventually sets in. Oh well, much of this is washed away in the emotionally wrenching finale, a worthy tribute to the crew of the Andrea Gail as well as to all the men and women who have lost their lives at sea.

But I was wrong ... If the director had cut out the first hour and focused on the struggle with the elements, this would have been a great movie, even an instant classic. Now it is a movie that will soon be forgotten.If you think you have to watch this movie for the great acting, think again... The cast is OK and they probably did everything they could to make the best out of it, but it just isn't good enough to save the movie. Especially the first hour, before the boat gets in the middle of the storm, is unbelievably boring, far too emotional and oh so predictable. It seemed like everybody already knew what was going to happen, like they already knew the boat isn't going to return.What I did like about the movie was the special effects. Thanks to these special effects, the movie really comes to life in the last section, when the storm hits. Those waves were absolutely terrifying. It almost feels like you'll be swept away by them yourself. You'll probably be on the edge of your seat during those storm sequences. If you see the movie, try seeing it on a big screen with a good sound system, I'm sure that's the best way to enjoy it. Having said all this, I think you know why you should or shouldn't watch this movie. I gave it a 6/10 only because I loved those special effects.

Yet aside from giving us a taste of this catastrophe (in hopes of entertainment?), the film doesn't offer much in the conventions of screenplay or plot, and just as George Clooney, Mark Wahlburg and their crew drift into sea after giving their farewells to their family and abode, the writing is plenty more shallow than the setting, and you might even say exhibiting a watery core. We learn of these unfortunate men and their ambitions of catching the mother load of all fish consuming their judgment, and while temporarily residing in a Massachussetts seaport, they live upon the sea, though Mark Wahlburg cannot stand to be distant from Diane Lane (perhaps he shouldn't be a fisherman). For some reason there is much emphasis on the fishermen and their relationships (as apparently these were true acquaintances) throughout the initial half-hour of the film. Is this concentration meant to build a certain compassion and understanding for the characters, thus we become emotionally involved in their plights at sea, or is this a human story meant to occur before their tragic transition and to convey the bereavements that were actually received back home from their loved ones and acquaintances. For whatever the reason, all of the emphasis on the characters is exhausted here, and little besides confrontation and occasional reflection is expressed by the fishermen, as they plunge into the wrath of the sea. When the action occurs, it certainly feels real and is meant to terrify, yet for some reason, our consideration for the characters becomes lost in the feast of visuals, and we can only anticipate that they will face inevitable doom in the scorn of the beast of the ocean, rather than survive to tell the tale. Though it sounds impossible to imagine, the action eventually became never-ending and somewhat tedious- I was anxious for it to finally end, albeit hardly encouraging the characters' dismal fate. The Perfect Storm offers fantastic and laudable visuals, yet lackluster dialogue and plot (it was melodrama watching two of the fishermen duke it out at times).

What has emerged is an empty, soulless presentation of eye-popping scenes tied to nothing at all.

Kangaroos and cars both travel at constant speeds, the former in straight lines, the latter along marked routes.

I was obviously expecting a philosophical drama about the eternal struggle between Man and Nature, and, knowing that the film is based on an authentic event that took place only some years ago, an extremely violent storm on the Atlantic, in which none of the crew members of a small fishing trawler survived, I really wondered how Hollywood would treat the subject. The fact that a German was elected director added another suspense-creating factor Would there be a surprising turnaround to the habitual glorification of heroism, to the idealization of Mankind? But Wolfgang Petersen seems to be well installed in the mechanisms of Hollywood now and does not reveal much of his European origins. The Perfect Storm has the same ingredients like any of the other big disaster movies shot in the past A bunch of outstanding men, some minor human disharmonies, which are quickly overcome in the face of death, and, above all, an overwhelming air of triumph. Yes, there is triumph, even if they all have to perish. The fishermen fight heroically, and they manage to celebrate quite a number of victories until they finally come to that ultimate wave which is just a little bit too strong for any human being to conquer. Has Nature won the battle?No, of course not. The elemental forces, the veritable villains of the movie, have only been able to inflict minor injuries to the human body.

However they find themselves stuck with a storm front barring their way back to home.  They push on regardless into one of the biggest storms ever recorded &#150; a combination of three separate fronts coming together.This film had it's UK premier just ½ a mile from my front door in Birmingham's biggest cinema complex, Clooney came over for it himself (don't know how much he liked being able to see junction 6 of the M6 from where he landed! So at the time I did kinda want to see this film, but never got round to it.  I have just seen it on video and feel that I've put the film at a disadvantage because the best thing about it (the special effects) don't work as well on a 21 inch screen as on a cinema screen.The plot is based on a true story but from my understanding is pretty fictionalised given the outcome.  That's not a problem however as it isn't a solemn tribute to these men &#150; just a record of the storm itself.  The fact that it's focus is the storm IS the problem.  For the first hour we catch fish, fight on the board, bond with family etc and generally try to build these fishermen into characters and not fodder like a disaster movie.  This is painfully slow and didn't work for me &#150; I was interested in the men but it seemed to me that the film wasn't.  The first half wasn't spend getting to know the crew, rather it just felt guilty to rush into action &#150; this isn't an action movie after all, it is a TRUE story!  Therefore I felt that the film thought it owed the characters something.The second half is actually pretty good but it's all due to the seamless effects and some good direction.  The waves look real and even on my TV I got into the tension and fear of the storm.  However the film leaves the fishing boat for most of the tensest scenes and joins the rescue efforts in other areas &#150; the Andrea Gail is actually used surprisingly little in the second half considering the focus of the first half.  My one problem with the effects is the same one I had with mission Impossible &#150; we've already seen the money shot in the trailers and adverts etc.  Here the money shot is the huge wave itself &#150; and I felt robbed that I'd seen that on the poster and on the TV.The heavyweight cast are all solid actors &#150; from the stars to the support names.  However they can't compete with the effects.  I mean Bob Gunton is a good actor when he is given the chance but here he is only ever seen in the midst of a rolling boat or in the sea!  Clooney and Walberg are both good and it's good that they did something a little different from a traditional action movie.  The rest of the crew are also all good in the first half &#150; what do you expect from names like Fichtner, Reilly, Payne and Hawkes.  But again in the second half they are simply thrown around on a massive soundstage.  The one thing I must praise is that they meet the end of the film with dignity and no-one goes after a hammy exit.  The women are left with the worst roles &#150; all they can do is look weepy and stare out to sea.  Mastrantonio gets to sail a boat but that's about it for her.  Karen Allen and Diane Lane are both wasted and landlubber Michael Ironside turns up just long enough to sneer and collect his cheque.Overall the first hour drags a little despite the strong cast making up the crew of the Andrea Gail.  The second half is good but only because the effects are so powerful that you'll get caught up in the storm yourself.  However when it was all over I was left wondering what I'd just seen &#150; it looks like it's a true story and a drama but really it is just another summer effects movie (except this one is a little less fun that the others).  At the end of the day, despite it's odd strong point I found this to be a perfect storm in a teacup.

For a break from the monotony of giving away details I will without any spoilers, tell you all how I decided to watch this movie and how I'm recommending the movie community why this movie is something everyone should see this classic film. Before purchasing this movie, I kind of for a long time overlooked it and even ignored at the notion of watching this movie for the simple reason of not caring the least. I can't say I'm the biggest George Clooney aficionado, though he's a very talented performer and even Mark Wahlberg for that matter. Suffice to say these two performers are not in this movie for the girls to go gaga for. Their physical appearance is staggeringly quite scraggy and disheveled and very overwhelmingly worn out. On a plus side there is no Hollywood-like glorification in The Perfect Storm. I was 15-years-old when No-Name Storm which was the name of The Perfect Storm was at the time came out back in October of 1991. At that age, weather was something that never crossed my mind. I vaguely remembered the events that happened 25 years ago except that there were three storms uniting within each other and that it was one of the scariest natural disasters in the East Coast I have ever witnessed. But there was more than just a nasty storm that erupted in the East Coast of North America than meets the eye. I didn't know that a ship was lost at sea in the midst of all this chaos. Then the book by Sebastian Junger came out and I neglected to read that as well. Then nine years later, the movie came into fruition, but the critics didn't have too much of a positive reception to it. Then after scurrying through the trailers, the documentaries and the making of the film, I was nevertheless curious to see what was the hype about this movie. I won't give away too many spoilers because we all know how a film like this will transpire. One thing for sure, the story's main focus isn't just circled around the fishing ship known as the Andrea Gail, but about an eager weather reporter who's enthusiastic to seeing the perfect storm materialize on his radar system, some subtle love subplots, another story about another ship that was saved, and the trials and tribulations the Navy encountered that led to the Andrea Gail being swallowed by the perfect storm. For better understanding of the movie, I'd recommend you see the making of documentary. It was so inspiring that the crew went out of their way to film most of this movie off the coasts in Massachusetts. They even went as far to go in actual lobster and fishing boats and even took the occasional dip in eternally frozen waters to get the feeling of the cold and wetness of this awful storm. Clooney and Massachusetts' own Wahlberg got the chance to meet the locals there who have lost a family member/s who were on the Andrea Gail. It was cool that these families were portrayed in the movie and that the studio created special effects to make every scene all the more authentic. It shows that the crew were really doing their homework here. I suggest you all watch The Perfect Storm. It's both technically done with no stone overturned and the the performances were very real and it shows how humans react when natural disasters hit close to home and where unity comes to life opposed to the divinity it is in our ordinary lives.

Every once in a while comes a surprise from this underused genre, this disaster drama directed by Wolfgang Peterson is one that graciously memorable and one that should still hold to this day. This movie set in the fall of 1991 tells the true story of Billy Tyne (played by George Clooney), a swordfisherman who leads his crew of fishermen on one last fishing expedition for the season across the Atlantic Ocean, despite the warnings of Captain Linda Greenlaw (played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) of a nasty hurricane approaching. As you may guess, what starts off as an enjoyable time of fish hunting and drinking becomes a terrifying fight for survival when the crew is caught into the powerful storm that puts their lives in serious peril. Highlighting a stellar cast aside Clooney of Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, John Hawkes, Allen Payne, and Diane Lane; this movie pulls a truly terrifying experience sparkled with a great screenplay and credible performances.The title speaks well as this storm was called by meteorologists 'The Storm of The Century', and with the story dealing with such a devastating disaster; you should more than likely anticipate some emotional intensity to come. This is indeed, a really intense film that leaves your heart pounding and praying for the characters' survival, especially as this is a true story. Like many real-life based films, the accuracy of the events is subject for debate, but those who grow enticed by the moving story are likely to ignore the possible liberties this film takes. The characters are finely developed and grow to be likable, even when they are shown to have rude sides. The performances by the cast are quite good, though none of them solidly stand out whether is George Clooney stepping into the role of the well dedicated captain, or Mark Wahlberg playing a young rookie fisherman with a cautious girlfriend back at home played by Diane Lane . Nothing Oscar-worthy should be expected. The story moves at a decent pace and builds up to anticipated climax. The entire sequence of the violent storm are mightily brought to life by chilling special effects and dazzling visuals to embrace the authenticity, and leaves just enough room for emotional resonance to sink in. The Perfect Storm does not sit on the throne of disaster movies, nor does it to. But it is a powerful film that is both entertaining and somewhat tear-jerking, and not in a manipulative manner. The cast performances are great, the screenplay works like a charm, and director Wolfgang Peterson does a gracious job on paying a tribute to the victims of the the disaster.

The sets and photography are blameless and the visual and sound effects are excellent, especially portraying the storm (indeed deserved the Oscar nomination precisely for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects).

The cast, however, was all at a great level and manages to capture the sympathy of the audience, who suffers with them and go with them to the sea, eager to return to earth and get away from that cruel and rough waters.Although this movie has passed quietly and still be a film that is not much remembered, its an excellent disaster film (much better than others, showing disasters that never happen) that deals with facts that cost the lives of hundreds of fishermen and sailors every year. So, apart from a great movie, it's a beautiful tribute to these men and their families.

Just so-so.","Date":"7 April 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" The Perfect Storm features some excellent special effects and some good thrills while at sea, but the film ultimately fails to generate real drama. The story spends ample time developing the characters and getting us to know them, but nearly half of it is on land so I felt like I was missing out. My understanding is that if you take the book this film was based on, you take some of the actual facts of what happened on the commercial fishing boat Andrea Gail, you make up a events and toss some wicked special effects together you've got the plot of this movie. Desperate for money after a series of bad catches, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and his crew, consisting of Mark Wahlberg as Bobby, John C. Reilly as Murph, William Fichtner as Sully, Allen Payne as Alfred and John Hawkes as Bugsy all set sail&#x85; unaware that there is a storm brewing on the ocean&#x85; The titular Perfect Storm! Once at sea the crew spends so much time barely making it through the day and bickering between each other that when they get into some severe weather trouble we really don't feel like they stand a chance. They never proved to me that they can handle your run-of-the-mill stressful situation so when things went bad here, I was underwhelmed. We never see the well-oiled machine that would boldly go into the ocean thinking nothing can stop them so the ensuing streak of catastrophes feels like it was just something inevitable instead of a tragic and frightening development. It'd be like mocking Freddy Krueger on a Halloween night while staying at Crystal Lake. It would be a shock if you DIDN'T end up being in a horrific situation. I also feel like a big gripe that I have with the film is its length. The film also has several sub plots that could have been dropped. At 2 hrs. + this disaster film is way too long for its own good and some audiences will check out way before the titular storm even arrives. Whether you get bored or not you'll likely leave puzzled after seeing the ending. Even though the final events do follow the rest of the film logically and it's clear that it was genuine respect and admiration that inspired the film it's a big miss-step that brings it down even further. In the end it's not really that the movie is that bad as much as it's underwhelming considering how great the well done moments are. I say it's a middle-of-the-road picture because half of the movie is just kind of OK, and when the storm is raging, it's awesome so it averages out to&#x85; an average movie. I do admire the special effects though, if this movie was ever released in theatres again, and maybe even in 3-D it would look terrific and I'd jump to the opportunity to see it again.

It is set in the waters east of Gloucester, Massachusetts in the fall of 1991. At the end of dismal fishing season, the swordfish boat Andrea Gail and her crew go out for one last run of the season, before a much-needed break. After setting the lines and hitting big numbers, the ship is forced to turn home to unload its catch early. In its return trip, the Andrea Gail gets caught between Hurricane Grace and an unnamed nor'easter. The movie touches on some of the science behind the storm and for the most part it was accurate. The low-pressure nor'easter absorbed Hurricane Grace, producing a massive storm. The movie makes out the convergent storm to be once in a lifetime, which it is. A hurricane powering a cyclone doesn't happen frequently. One thing I felt was very interesting in the movie was the response of the Coast Guard. It's thought provoking when you realize they were out at sea during a storm that was powerful enough to thoroughly restrict even the Coast Guard Search and Rescue from doing their job. There is not much you can do when the rescuers need rescuing. It further exemplifies the audacity and bravery that the crew showed in being out on the water during the storm.

Sword fishing vessel Andrea Gail, captained by Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is forced to take a gamble that could end in large, much needed profit or the loss of his ship and crew. A cold front moving from Canada to the east and another front moving in from the west converge off the New England coast in the Atlantic Ocean, feeding the existing Hurricane Grace in the middle. Andrea Gail and her crew must either sail straight through the storm before their haul spoils or turn tail to get out of the hurricane on steroids, thus risking their jobs. The film's meteorologist Todd Gross (Christopher McDonald) deems this highly unusual natural phenomenon terrorizing all in its course the perfect storm.This storm of the century is a cinematic depiction of the actual super storm that took place along the New England coast during the Halloween of 1991. A combination of sheer natural power and technological failure pushes the Andrea Gail and crew to their limits and beyond. Even with the U.S. Coast Guard scouring the Atlantic with all their resources and search- and-rescue expertise, this meteorological disaster of epic proportions shows no mercy and yields little hope for survivors. The Perfect Storm serves as commemoration to the thousands of fishermen who have lost their lives seeking the Atlantic's bounty and truly reminds its audience what it means to be alive, and dry.

Come onboard, the Andrea Gail!","Date":"16 August 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" The Perfect Storm is no way a perfect movie. It's a biographical disaster drama with a predictable downer ending, but you see, how much, these men were so driven as fishermen. I think, that's the best part about the movie. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the movie is an adaptation of the 1997 non-fiction book of the same title by Sebastian Junger about the crew of the Andrea Gail, a swordfish boat that got caught in the middle of the Perfect Storm of 1991. The movie is very moving and edge-of-your-seat experiences. The movie is full of great actors putting their all into this film with their acting. You really get to see the chemistry between the Captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and his supporting cast of fishermen. George Clooney is believable, and you can honestly, see him in this lead role. He really give some great talk interaction with both Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Mark Wahlberg's characters. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is just awful, her accent will guaranteed to make viewers from Massachusetts cringe. Likewise, the relationship between Tyne and Linda Greenlaw was fictitious. Tyne and Greenlaw were barely acquainted in real life. While, it's clear that George Clooney is stirring the ship as the on screen lead. It's in fact, Mark Wahlberg whom get most of the screen time as Robert Bobby Shatford. The movie focus on his love-affair with Christina Chris Cotter (Diane Lane) more than anything in the film. Because of this, we rarely know anything much about the others crew, besides a few details just there to pull heart strings. Dale Murph Murphy (John C. Reilly) is a veteran fisherman whom divorced with a son with whom he's very involved in. Murph also has rocky relationship with crewmember David Sully Sullivan (William Fichtner) for odd reason, never explain in the film. They really make Sully look like hothead, and it's sucks that he don't know, anything about him, besides that. Then, there is Michael Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes), a member of the Andrea Gail crew, whom all we know about him is that he fix the ice machine, and can't find dates with women. The worst coverage has to be Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), he don't know, anything about him besides that he can't speak English, very well. Honestly, his character was really just demoted to an extra. One of the biggest faults of the film is that the film focus way too much on the sub-plot rescue missions on a down Air National Guard rescue helicopter and the sailboat Satori with characters, we barely know about. The movie shows only have focus on the events that the Andrea Gail was going through. It felt like, I was watching two different movies trying to act like one. Don't get me wrong, the Satori and the helicopter mission was interesting, but I think, the reason, most people came to see this movie was to hear the story of what happen to the Andrea Gail. It felt like it was just running the run time. Some critics had a problem with the authenticity, that the movie change a lot of what really happen. They even add some action scenes to the film, such in the case of the shark, and the hook. Most names were not changed for the fictional film, and some families of certain crew members of the Andrea Gail sued the producers because of that, and that their names were used without their permission. The movie depicted Billy Tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous, which is up to air, but also makes them look very foolish. No wonder, why the victim family didn't like it. The movie really did have some of the best special effects at the time. It was pretty impression to watch. For a PG-13, the film does have a lot of man Vs Nature action scenes that was scary to watch, because you know it could happen. Parents need to know that this movie has some strong sailor language and some sexual references that can get crude. For most parents, the primary concern will be the sadness of the movie. Like, I said, it's a downer movie. It's not really much of a spoiler, since the movie opens with foreshadowing. The first scene of the movie shows the wall listing the fisherman lost at sea throughout the centuries after all. Even the trailer kinda spoil it. It's a tear jerking man movie, so make sure, you bring your tissue paper when watching this. Another great high light of the film is the music. James Horner is like Hans Zimmer and Danny Eflman; they all recycle old themes of theirs and they never compose a truly 'Original' Score, but every score they do compose is always phenomenal to hear, either way. This is one of those. It's just beautiful to listen to. 'Yours Forever' written by James Horner and performed by John Mellencamp is just amazing. It's one of my favorite songs on my IPOD playlist. Overall It's an intense, real and emotional experience that just has to be watch to understand. Despite some faults, Perfect Storm is still one of my favorite movies of the early 2000s.

See it uncut. Parts of it are truly spellbinding and shouldn't be diminished by interruptions. In essence, a perfect storm is a situation where everything goes completely wrong at the same time. Here we have a film, based on the true story of the boat The Andrea Gale, of 6 brave fishermen trying to make a living in one of the most dangerous of all professions They are underpaid sword-fishermen, from Gloucester, Mass. On their journey, one gets tangled up in the bait-hook line and is pulled overboard. One is nipped badly by a shark. Many overboard rescues, as they battle the storm due to desperation for the perfect catch and travel too far away from safe waters. Not for the squeamish, as baiting, harpooning and gutting the catch is vividly portrayed. The Storm of the Century, in 1991, was the intersection of as many as 3 different (or more) tropical storms off of Bermuda. Most of the action, as the doomed crew tries very desperately to turn the boat around, is both fanciful and actual, because after the radio failed, no one knows exactly what really happened. The ship's mast breaks. The refrigeration fails. The anchor crashes through the windows. A Coast Guard helicopter goes down trying to attempt rescue. (They run out of fuel because they rescue people from a small yacht on the way there, and then airborne refueling fails.) Had they been able to fly directly to the boat, a rescue might have been possible. So many things go wrong at once that the brave crew never has a chance. An unbelievable giant wall of water capsizes the boat for the very last time. The perfect disaster. Fantastic action and special effects. Some salty language. The storm scenes feel real. Great performances by George Clooney and Mark Wahlburg. Quite an intense experience, and I saw it on a small 50 inch screen!

Facts prove that no one really knows what happened to the Andrea Gail because the search for the ship was called off. The Coast Guard called off their search after thousands of miles of searching with no sight of the boat according to the Gloucester Times web page. However, the movie needed to improvise and make closure with the audience. This movie succeeded in doing so as the image it created captivated audiences and it created a realistic ending to an event that no one knows the actual truth as to what happened. The book Perfect Storm also showed the ability to intrigue audiences. The book, written by Sebastian Junger, provided pictures of the actual fishermen that were on board, pictures of the harbor before, during and after the storm, and it provided pictures of the memorial service held for the fishermen who died. It also used an alternate ending to give the audience closure. The author and director both gain from creating an ending because they captured their audience and profited well from doing so. For example, in the movie, the boat Andrea Gail lost radio contact with another boat, from there, the crew of six men got caught up in the storm, and eventually a big wave came in and capsized the boat. This was the image the movie was able to put in viewers heads, instead of leaving the viewers with curiosity as to what really happened to the crew. Another factor that makes the movie intriguing to audiences is the choice of actors for the crew. The captain of the boat is George Clooney who is deemed to be a famous actor with prestigious roles and awards. Also Mark Walberg and John C. Riley were fishermen on the boat, and they also have a well known audience. This allowed the viewers to experience an historical event flipped into a drama containing well talented actors. I argue that the movie was a success financially and emotionally. The movie produced over $182,618,434 while in box office theatres and is still making money off of merchandise to this day. I've experienced movies that were based on true events, and they had rather subpar actors. This is where the director of The Perfect Storm, Wolfgang Petersen, profited due to having well known actors and creating a strong conclusion. Including the well known actors mentioned above, the movie also includes actors and actresses that are attractive figures for the audience. By doing this, the director profited because viewers watch movies to see great endings. The ending of the movie gave the audience different viewpoints to understand and relate to. It not only shows the struggles that the crew has to go through, but it shows the struggles that other characters had too. For example, it shows a family stuck within the storm, and it gives the audience a chance to understand their struggle. Also the Coast Guard and multiple weather stations were involved in experiencing drama of their own. Lastly, the viewpoint of the family and friends of the fisherman gave the audience a chance to experience the same sorrow and morose feelings that the family and friends had. By striking the relationship between the movie and the viewer the director succeeded. He was able to captivate emotional ties between the character's stories and the audience. The ability to do this has led this film to great awards and accomplishments. It won best visual effects in the BAFTA awards and was nominated for many other awards including the Academy Awards for visual effects and best sound. According to boxofficemojo.com, The Perfect Storm placed 43rd on the all time list of total gross income by movies.Overall, The Perfect Storm needed to show what may have truthfully happened to the crew. If the movie failed to create this image, then the audience would have been left curious and no closure would have taken place. The director, Wolfgang Petersen, did a great job in choosing the right actors, a believable conclusion, and developing a story that would leave the audience emotionally tied to the film. This led to an extremely profitable and successful film that actually did a good job of including drama.

As others have said before, this is a recreation and interpretation of the events. It was not meant to be spot on! We will never know what actually happened on the boat; in that sense I disregard anyone who says that it was false and wrong. A user previously reviewed that they disliked how Hollywood portrayed the women in this film, for making them seem too emotional and stereotypical. Especially the opening scene when Diane Lane wakes up from a nightmare about her boyfriend on the ocean. Can I just say, that as someone who had a brother who fished and has numerous close friends who fish or are married/dating fishermen, I always was worried if they would come home safe. Anyone who has anyone that they love out there thinks the same things and worries constantly about it until they are home. I have known a few people who were lost out on the sea and it is NOT unreasonable or over-sensitive to portray people (male or female) as being over emotional for having nightmares about those they love who are out fishing. It is fact. Obviously this user has NO IDEA what it's like for families of those out there putting their lives at risk.I thought this movie was overall very, very good. I re-watch it often and love it! "}{"Title":"Seamless special effects steal the film","Date":"23 February 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" The plot is simple. Half a dozen regular fishermen (well regular except for the fact that one looks like George Clooney and one looks like Mark Wahlberg) set out catch swordfish and get caught up in a monster storm. Essentially you get one hour of build up and characterisation and one hour of the storm. In this respect it is a very conventional film and it is quite shameless in the way it manipulates emotions to get you to care about the characters, and even though you can see every last scrap of the manipulative elements you do care about the characters.What is so special about this film though is the storm sequences which are an absolute knockout from beginning to end. I don't remember ever being so on the edge of my seat in a film (Petersen's earlier Das Boot came pretty close though) even though I knew what the ending was. Henceforth a film's grippingness can only be measured against The Perfect Storm. You go in being prepared to see big seas and men being thrown about on sets on rollers but when you are watching it you just can't believe how awesome the scenes are that you are watching. And it just goes on and on and on &#x96; bigger, louder, more outrageous.You know that you must be watching models or larger mock-ups in some of the scenes. You know the action must have been filmed in tanks under controlled conditions. You know that you must be watching mechanical effects and computer-generated effects and blue screen work. These techniques are the only way that a lot of this film could be made. Yet I could not see the seams at any point in this film. I could not see which were models, which effects, which blue screens. The whole damn thing is so completely seamless that every single scene looks authentic. Now I don't care what you say but even otherwise excellent films like Titanic and Gladiator have some truly awful effects &#x96; in both of the films mentioned the worst effects are the large scale flyovers of huge computer generated sets &#x96; they look good but not good enough to convince me.George Lucas has an avowed intent of making films which seamlessly blend live action, animated characters and CGI effects and we all know how tragically he failed to achieve this in the Phantom Menace, one of the worst films in the history of cinema. The Perfect Storm though succeeds even though some of the characters and conveyor-belt script are as cardboard as Star Wars characters. The action and the effects are just that good that they run the film and as a viewer you are completely swept away by them. Lucas should be so lucky &#x96; he should obviously give up directing immediately and let the real innovators in ILM, the guys who did the effects for this movie, take over.If The Perfect Storm doesn't excite you as a piece of film making, even if the storyline is by-the-numbers, then I find it hard to believe you like films at all and you would be better off reading a book.

Most of his movies I haven't cared for, and most of his performances I've found rather dry and lifeless. Neither of those criticisms can be levelled at A Perfect Storm, however. This is a fantastic movie. It's exciting, the effects are fantastic, the killer storm is portrayed vividly and realistically. It's made more gut wrenching by the fact that it's based on a true story (the Andrea Gail and its crew were in fact lost during a huge monster storm in 1991) and while no one can know exactly what happened on board the ship in its last hours before sinking, the story as depicted is entirely believable. I can't believe much could have been done to have made this better.Clooney plays Billy Tyne - captain of the Andrea Gail. Going far out into the Atlantic to try to make up for a poor season, Tyne, his ship and his crew get caught in a covergence of storms that literally create a monster. While most of the movie depicts the Andrea Gail, it's equally tense watching a small private yacht get caught in the storm, watching a coast guard cutter and helicopter try to rescue the yacht's crew and watching as the families of the Andrea Gail's crew await news. The opening half hour or so of the movie is a bit slow paced and is used to provide background on the various crew members. But the time spent on that isn't wasted. We see the Andrea Gail's crew as real people because of that, with friends and wives and children waiting for them, and, knowing what their fate will be, there's a sense of heaviness as you watch them say good bye as they head off on what will be their last voyage.In a way it's the storm, far more than Clooney, that's the star of this movie. It's frighteningly depicted. Clooney is balanced by a good supporting cast, including people like Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reilly. While Clooney is the obvious lead, there's very much an ensemble feel to this, especially among the cast who play the Andrea Gail's crew. This truly is a superb movie.

The film's ultimate goal is one I can recognize; showcasing rather two-dimensional characters in a plot surrounding an enormous storm that engulfed the east coast and created millions of dollars in restitution payments and to showcase the storm itself. It succeeds in both. This is nowhere near a fleshed-out film, but it isn't a ho-hum Michael Bay extravaganza, where faint archetypes take the stage instead of compelling characters. This is a rare occurrence where even though we do not know a whole lot about these characters, we come to sympathize with them in the final act for reasons we can not totally explain. Perhaps their personalities, or maybe their innocence, has grabbed onto us.The film focuses on the storm of October 1991, where a nor'easter was absorbed by Hurricane Grace to create one of the most violent and unforgiving storms in history. We center around a swordfishing team who drive a boat named the Andrea Gail in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Captained by Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and made up of members Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly), David Sullivan (William Fichtner), Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), and Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes), the boat has continuously brought in a miniscule amount of fish, resulting in very low pay among the crewmembers.They sail out past their usual turf, with an unmaintainable, unpredictable storm is brewing in the back of them. When they decide to travel all the way to Flemish Cap, an even further location, they wind up catching, literally, a boatload of fish, but with a broken ice-machine, they must hurry back before the catch spoils. Waiting would result in a wasted trip, so by the crew's unanimous agreement, they push on through the treacherous waters, fifty foot waves, unforgivable currents, and constant rainfall to bring the town of Gloucester their catch.Astraphobics and Lilapsophobics be forewarned; this film is relentless in its depiction of brutal weather. Shots of currents consuming the Andrea Gail are not uncommon, nor are underwater sequences which are expertly directed and choreographed. Petersen never seems to lose control of this monumental picture, despite filming it on such a large grid. His direction never once becomes sterile or anemic, and it seems that with Das Boot, The Perfect Storm, and the recent Poseidon remake under his belt, he has a more confident feeling underwater than on the surface.When The Perfect Storm deals with the troubles on surface it does not try to undermine them. It shows contentions crewmates had with each other, the restlessness of going out against better judgment, and the idea of the possible loss of loved ones. Writers Bo Goldman and William D. Wittliff unfortunately tuck deeper characteristics away, but a deep character study shouldn't be expected when we have a film centered around a colossal disaster. We get solid, fleshed-out characters and that is enough.The true shine is watching elaborate shots of remarkable special effects take center stage to create a grimly realistic setting of the ocean at its worst. The scene which has been used as the film's main theatrical poster is truly a sight to behold. It's remarkable how scene after scene of The Perfect Storm isn't taken with incredulity or a bent reality. It isn't as narrow-minded or as hackneyed as its premise would expect. It isn't typical Hollywood-driven disaster schlock. It's quick, evocative, and effectively entertaining.Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, John C. Reilly, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, William Fichtner, Bob Gunton, and Karen Allen. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen.

The film stars George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg together with William Fichtner, John C. Reilly, Allen Payne, John Hawkes, Diane Lane, Michael Ironside, Karen Allen and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.It was directed Wolfgang Petersen.In October 1991, the swordfishing boat Andrea Gail returns to port in Gloucester, Massachusetts with a poor catch. Desperate for money, Captain Billy Tyne, convinces the Andrea Gail crew to join him for one more late season fishing expedition. They head out past their usual fishing grounds, leaving a developing thunderstorm behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the Flemish Cap, where their luck improves. At the height of their fishing the ice machine breaks; the only way to sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. After debating whether to sail through the building storm or to wait it out, the crew decide to risk the storm. However, between the Andrea Gail and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a hurricane, which the Andrea Gail crew underestimate.After repeated warnings from other ships, the Andrea Gail loses her antenna, forcing a fellow ship to call in a Mayday. An Air National Guard rescue helicopter responds, but after failing to perform a midair refuel, the helicopter crew ditch the aircraft before it crashes, and all but one of the crew members are rescued by a Coast Guard vessel, the Tamaroa. The Andrea Gail endures various problems with 40-foot waves crashing onto the deck, a broken stabilizer ramming the side of the ship, and two men thrown overboard. The crew decide to turn around to avoid further damage by the storm. After doing so, the vessel encounters an enormous rogue wave. Billy tells Bobby to apply full power to ride over the wave; it seems that they may make it over, but the wave starts to plunder and the boat flips over. Billy elects to go down with his ship and only Bobby manages to surface. There are no survivors, however, and the film ends with Captain Greenlaw reading the eulogy at the memorial service, followed by Christina and Bobby's mother, Ethel, consoling each other on the dock and Billy's voice pontificating about what it means to be a sword boat captain.The film has a relatively simple story about dedicated fishermen from Gloucester,MA trying to make a catch that was caught in a disastrous storm.While the special effects are well done and quite impressive, the viewer may get concerned about this film as it suffers from any actual drama or characterization which they believe that is required in any movie.But nevertheless,I still consider it an awfully good film. Although people may dread the experience that these fishermen had,it nevertheless was full of entertainment as for the viewer gets to experience the life of fisherman and the emotions,feelings and aspiration that they go through life.Overall,it is a still a must-see for people wanting to get a view of how life is lived in the sea.

This film is well acted, some exciting action sequences on air and sea, some touching moments but the screenplay by William D. Wittliff (Legends of the Falls) has moments of clichéd as well. This has one of the highest grossing films of 2000. This has fine supporting performances by Diane Lane and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. This has strong visual effects by the Oscar-Winner effects companyIndustrial, Light & Magic.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.351) transfer and an strongDolby Digital 5.1 Expanded Surround Sound.

Commentary three is by the authorSebastian Junger. The most fascinating commentary track is by Junger. DVD also an behind the scenes featurette and more. This film received two Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. This movie was probably most memorable in theaters.

This was a very famous, very publicized TRUE story that was in every magazine and had a best-selling book written about it. Does everyone not know how it ends to begin with?? That's like being upset when Lou Gehrig dies at the end of his life story. With that off my chest, I can continue. I too read the book, and it was excellent. I watched the HBO First Look special about the movie, and couldn't wait to see it. I was highly disappointed. I realize that with any based on a true story film, certain dramatic liscense has to be taken. Every conversation between characters cannot be remembered verbatim. And all the main characters died, so no one knows what went on on the ship. I know the special effects were great, blah blah blah (although my 9-year-old daughter even noticed several times, Gosh, that looks fake.). But couldn't they have spent more time fleshing out the characters and their relationships, and not have relied so much on the made-up goings-on on the Andrea Gail during the storm? (I totally disagree with Roger Ebert's review in which he says that more character development was not needed). That is what made the book so good--by the end, you really cared about these people and what happened to them--even though you knew in advance that it didn't have a happy ending. Not so in the movie, I thought. Billy Tyne (George Clooney) was portrayed as so gruff and unpleasant (and senseless) that I expected him to break out in an ARRRRRGH and perch a parrot on his shoulder any minute. It was difficult to like him--in real life, he didn't have nearly the callous disregard for his crew that this guy in the movie did. The Sully-Murph brouhaha went on and on and was never clearly explained--a mention of Murph's wife was made, but that very thin plot line was never fleshed out. They acted like two silly teenage boys. So write them off too (although I love John C. Reilly; I think he is a wonderful actor and was given no chance to shine in this film). Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg) was little more than a tormented guy pining for his girlfriend (they weren't married, contrary to other posts) and playing yes-man to Billy Tyne. Alfred Pierre and Bugsy were the only ones who were likeable out of the whole crew. (But what was up with Bugsy and the woman he had JUST met before he went out on his doomed voyage? You would've thought they had been together for years. What an odd relationship). Another thing, Chris (Diane Lane)supposedly had lost her kids--why was that not explained? They were so many hanging threads that were never pulled on that could have made a much better movie. All that was cared about here, it seems, was the storm. A storm alone does not a movie make. I thought it was long, slow, and b-o-r-i-n-g. The acting was poor--actually, the lines they were given were poor, since most of them are skilled actors. (Although am I the only woman in the world who thinks George's appeal is overrated?) You could hardly tell that the book and the movie were related. I had heard that one of the families of the crew sued the filmmakers for portraying the character in a poor light--I can't remember who. At first I thought, oh, what a poor sport--supposedly at first the town welcomed the film crew with open arms. Now, I understand. And if I was Sebastian Junger, the author of the book, I'd sue too. If you must rent this, skip ahead to the last third of the movie just to see the storm. BUT--turn it off before the scene where Bobby is floating in the vast, storm-tossed ocean, trying to send telepathic messages to his girlfriend Chris. (And he stayed afloat amazingly easily, considering the elements. He barely had to put forth any effort to tread water, although those churning waves had just sunk the entire SHIP).Then--miraculously, later Chris tells the others at the bar that--gasp--she had had a dream about Bobby talking to her, replete with the SAME words we, the audience, had heard him say before he drowned. Isn't that amazing? I wanted to gag. I mean, there is dramatic liscense, and then there is crap. I was very disappointed by this movie. I give it a 4/10, and the 4 is only for the special effects, and the fact that Mark Wahlberg was in it at all.

There literally is nothing besides the crashing waves to keep you interested.  The characters are flat and frankly, nothing else really happens.  The only things we know about Clooney is that he's a single guy that loves the sea and used to be a good fisherman.  Oh wait, he also may or may not have a thing for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.

The characters are portrayed as dull witted hooligans who cheer like people at a professional football game each time their boat manages to make it through one more wave. Most of the insight and depth of the original, and excellent, book were lost in this tawdry but expensive adaptation.Reality is suspended as in one cruise we have an on deck shark attack, an individual dragged overboard by the long line, and finally, a storm. Note that either of the first two incidents would have resulted in a return to port as massive infection and blood poisoning would have set in within hours in the injured crew person. One unbelievable scene has the crew waiting until the predicted storm has hit them with full fury before attempting to install the storm boards on the boat.On shore we have the obligate scene of an evil capitalist, in this case the boat owner, which seems a requirement in every movie made by large conglomerates. The owner is portrayed as a cartoon cut out cross between an unreformed Ebenezer Scrooge and Simon Legree. We never see the fishermen on shore participate in any activity other than drinking or fighting, which comes as a surprise to anyone who has ever lived in a fishing port, be it Newport, OR, or anywhere back east or down south. Character depth is discarded in favor of cheap and bizarre events at sea, and we miss the more profound juxtapositions found in Junger's book.For those who enjoyed the book, I recommend also reading Lost at Sea by Patrick Dillon which tells the sad story of the loss of one of the A boats out of Anacortes, WA.

This film at least attempts to make the audience care about it's characters, showing each of the crew mate's friends and lovers bidding them farewell during the film's first half-hour, before plunging them into the perilous though beautifully created depths of the hellish stormfront.The talented cast carries the story well.  Clooney is a completely underrated actor, and his muted performance here may be overshadowed by Whalberg, but Clooney's character comes off as the stronger between the two in retrospect Whalberg may love his girlfriend, but Clooney has a much deeper passion for the sea.  Reilly and Fichtner do their best with their cliched material as two feuding hotheads. Thankfully, The Perfect Storm doesn't forget what makes films truly emotional and memorable solid characters and good storytelling.

There has been a lot of justified criticism of this film but I really feel people should go and watch it to make their own minds up. I live in a coastal town in North East England which has a small fishing fleet and it was fascinating to learn just what fisherman sometimes have to go through.I hadn't heard of the 'Andrea - Gail' before I watched the film and even though I was warned that the film was based on a true story, I was shocked at the ending. I then went and read the book.The special effect are truly first class although they may lose some quality on the small screen so see it in the cinemas if you can.I will definitely be buying this movie - sure some of the actings over the top and the dialogue is pathetic in places i.e George Clooney's fisherman speech, but this film is still exciting and tragic.

Although I'm not sure what the alternative was - make a longer movie to allow more time to develop feelings for them?The special effects were amazing. The rubber fish looked real, and the waves looked incredible! Breath-taking!The movie did a good job of creating tension. You know something explosive will happen once the Andrea Gail reaches the storm (or vice versa), but you must wait for it a bit. The movie flashes between the wild storm scenes and the still-peaceful waters surrounding the Andrea Gail. Exciting.Now some bad news - the script and scenes were at times unbelievable and silly. My fiancee and I joke about the scene (PLOT SPOILER) when the Andrea Gail is going down Capt. Tyne apologizes to Bobby for getting you into this mess and Bobby replies That's alright cap. The water is quickly rising to their chins and they look downright nostalgic as they chat. Also at the end, when Bobby is in the water and waiting to die -he's peaceful and serene while thinking of his girlfriend. I couldn't help wondering why he wasn't a bit afraid or angry about dying. And yes, the movie does manipulate for tears.So, my final word is this - it's an entertaining movie. See it on video. But don't expect too much because you'll be disappointed.

You have action (sea storms, boats being destroyed, sharks), drama (deaths, tears, family affairs), romance (platonic love, a couple separated by the husband's duty). And you still leave the theater thinking that it is not a great film. Good, yes. But not something masterful or unforgettable. As a film based on a real story, THE PERFECT STORM doesn't take you to another world, but takes you to a showing of the complete fury of nature, something you had never seen before. Wow! If you want special effects, this film is for you. The scenes are so realistic that you feel you are on the storm with the fishermen. Water, water and water. Computers... What would we be without them? Well, a film like THE PERFECT STORM simply wouldn't exist. Director Wolfgang Petersen and the special effects creators should be applauded for such an amazing work as this. The audience liked and the film earned more than big hits as GLADIATOR and WHAT LIES BENEATH on its first weekend. And (what is better) lowing Mel Gibson's ego with THE PATRIOT.THE PERFECT STORM has more qualities (effective acting, a well prepared director, good tension), but has also problems. 1- The beginning is kind of slow and cliched. I know its objective is to introduce the characters, but it could have been less talkative and sentimental. 2- Some situations aren't needed. In fact, two of them the scene where the shark attacks Whalberg and the one where John C. Reilly is pulled by the fishing line, and the guys have to save him from drowning. If the point was to show that the guys made a perfect team together, even with their differences, and they were not blamed for the disaster, it was a little stupid. 3- Despite a long introduction to develop the characters, they weren't three dimensional. I would call them bi-dimensional characters. They change their way of thinking or their way of acting in a blink of eyes. Taking those three problems, THE PERFECT STORM is a good film. As I said, I loved the realism  and the tension of the second half. George Clooney, Mark Whalberg and John C. Reilly on the sea, and Diane Lane and the families on ground help to keep the emotions vivid. Many people complained that the ending is too sentimental, but oddly I liked it. I wasn't expecting that, because I haven't read the book and didn't know the whole story. Now I recognize the courage of those fishermen, even if many details of the real story were changed to write the screenplay for a big budget Hollywood movie. (Obviously it was)The veredict THE PERFECT STORM has its flaws, but it is a worth seeing, more for its amazing special effects than for its screenplay and character development. There were better films in this year's US summer (X-MEN, GLADIATOR) and worse (GONE IN 60 SECONDS, DINOSAUR), but good is what this movie is. Now, what would you expect from a $110 million dollars flick? An unexplained rain of frogs at the end? John C. Reilly was there too, by the way, if you get my point. Poor man!

Perhaps he thank that by using a strange grimace here and there he would become a perfect sailor...? Almost the whole movie it looks like he's posing for the girls at the other side of the screen. Is it perhaps that he was told to do that...? John Hawkes is a hundred times better as a sailor than him. A lot of people won't like what I'll say, but Clooney is for me an awful actor. While Paul Newman is a good-looking man and also a brilliant actor (try to imagine him (of course, a young Paul) in the role of the captain...), George Clooney is just a good-looking man.c) A child actor who does not convince at all. OK, he's only a child, but this is Hollywood at its best!d) A, let's say, strange story ending. When the film finished I was just waiting for another twenty minutes, so I said to myself, is that really all of it...? Of course, I don't want this to be a spoiler, so I won't say any more details.e) A suggested telepathy phenomenon out of place in my opinion. I won't say where it appears to avoid this commentary from being a spoiler.These are, among others, some of the things I dislike. This movie is nothing to write home about. It's entertaining, but it's mediocre. Perhaps the great mistake about it was the movie itself. In Twister (1996), for example, you see people running away from the wind cone, you see a bright day turning into a dark green sky, there is always something new to catch your eye and keep you interested. In this film we just see the giant waves here and there, and more waves, and more waves. When you see one, you have seen them all. If that's not enough, the actors don't do their best, and the plot is so simple that you wonder if there is really a plot behind the scenes.

I was blasted out of my seat with AIR FORCE ONE, and THE NEVERENDING STORY is still one my (and many others) favorite films from my youth.  That's why I was looking forward to watching THE PERFECT STORM, even though I really don't like George Clooney as an actor.  I was really surprised, however,  with Clooney this time around; his sincere perfomance as a likable fishing captain really helped this film, along with the actors, including Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly (who I personally loved in MAGNOLIA), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (I was wondering what happened to her), Diane Lane and Karen Allen. However, THE PERFECT STORM had a problem.  A big problem.  Let me put it this way, if the film HADN'T been based on a true story it would have been much more exciting and entertaining, which this film is really until halfway through, when you start to think (most people didn't, and that's why they loved it).The film draws it's story from a 1997 novel by Sebastion Junger, which in turn is based on an actual 1991 storm that was formed off the coast of Gloucester, Massachusetts and sunk a fishing boat called the Andrea Gail. According to the film (admittedly I have not read the book, which I understand is quite good) the group of fisherman leave Gloucester to go far out to catch a motherload of fish because of tensions between the captain (Clooney) and his boss (Michael Ironside) over financial complications (at least I think that's how I remember it).  The film then showcases what goes on the boat, including disputes and accidents, and eventually they are forced to make the decision to go through the storm and not let the fish go bad, or wait until storm subsides and then go through safely.  They choose to go through, and this is the one of the several plot turns that just seem to slap me across the face.  Why?Like another reviewer pointed out earlier in the reviews, how the hell does the screenwriter know what happened to the boat and it's crew?  He doesn't...plain and simple.  Even if this is a so-called dramatization of an actual event, it forces us to believe that this what happened just because of its saying that is based on a true story.  The moment that really did it for me was when Mark Wahlberg came up to the surface after the boat had sunk and was talking to his fiancee in this mind.  Come on, people....can you be more unrealistic and unbelievable than that?  That's why I said before that if that event had never happened, this would have been a much better movie, because like a lot of people I was drawn into it during the first part but then illogic eventually started washing across the screen like       those giant waves.  Oh, and about those waves.  I'm sorry, but I wasn't impressed, aside from the wave that toppled the boat over, it just seemed like I was watching a third-rate surfer video.  Hell, if you want to see some waves watch the end of the Special Edition version of THE ABYSS...those waves alone wash over every single one in STORM.One final thing before I wrap this up...at the end, the film (predictably) dedicates itself to the number of people that lost their lives off the coast of Gloucester.  Personally, I thought the book would have been an enough of a dedication because this movie I don't think does justice to them.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of them are doing sommersalts in their graves over the depiction of what was going on on their boat in the movie.  Like the unexplained disappearance of Amelia Earheart, maybe the filmmakers should have been honest in how much they really knew what happened to the Andrea Gail, which is really not that much.

The lead roles are taken by George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg who were together in `Three Kings' and seem likely to continue pairing up in further movies. The dialogue is often hard to follow, but in fact there is minimal plot or characterisation. Instead, as in `Twister' (1996), it is the elements which are centre stage and the special effects are utterly believable &#150; in both films, Industrial Light and Magic was responsible.

By doing so, The Perfect Storm is less a clinical, didactic story about five Gloucester fishermen who meet their demise at the confluence of three strong weather-makers and more a powerful statement about the courage of men and women who go out to sea.  The film doesn't cheapen itself with half-baked props nor maudlin scenes aimed at our heartstrings.  When you see waves, you really see waves;  when you see swordfish dragged on board or even a runaway shark, you really sense the real thing.  When you have a tear in your eye, it's because of the real sympathy you would have for your friends and neighbors.  The acting is superb - from Captain Bill (George Cooney) to Bobby and Christina (Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane) to Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantino) to Murph (John Reilly).  The addition of the love interest between the two rival ship captains and the budding romance between Bugsy and the older, plump Irene made the movie more human than the book.  While we sweat through this year's 'just-like-last-year's summer' movies, The Perfect Storm is the perfect summer movie -  one to excite you with its rich adventure and cinematography and to move you with its testament about the human spirit.

Because the nature of the events are so driven by the ravages of time, it is never possible to fully recreate the intrinsic suspense of the written word. Both books were marvels of journalistic reporting while each movie was but a shadow of each. That said, let me say that I enjoyed the The Perfect Storm as a movie as much for the atmosphere and attention to detail as for the special effects.I do have two misgivings however. The portrayal of the Coast Guard left much to be desired. Here we have a group of highly trained and courageous individuals who remain faceless through the entire ordeal. Faceless in the sense that we see them fifty feet wide on the screen but were we to meet any of them on the way out of the theater we would not recognize them. In my opinion, the story of the actions of the Coast Guard during that storm would make for a far more compelling and suspenseful movie.And then there is the soundtrack. If ever there was a case for less is more then this is it. It is obvious that Mr. Horner was given carte blanche when it came to the soundtrack because his music does little but intrude on the very essence of the movie - the storm. While the crew of the fishing boat fight for their lives, the sounds of the storm are quelled by the soaring strains of an otherwise innocuous soundtrack. I imagine that this is the result of too much adulation for an otherwise mediocre composer. I did not detect any plagiarism in this score - as yet. But given that his romantic theme from Braveheart was drawn from Holst's The Planets and that there was a most distinct homage to Ennio Moricone's The Mission in Good Will Hunting, further listening will tell.Apart from that, I enjoyed the movie.

George Clooney leads a terrific cast of stars and acting veterans in this tale of man against nature, based on a true story.Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is a sword fisherman who has had bad luck of late.  He is determined to bring in one large catch before the season ends so he takes his crew far offshore to the Flemish Cap, a place where the fish practically jump into the boat.  They fill the boat, but the ice machine breaks down, making it impossible to keep their catch fresh for long.  So, they head for home brimming with fish.  Unfortunately, nature has other plans and kicks up the mother of all hurricanes.  The rest of the film is an epic battle of man against nature, as the little fishing boat fights high winds and 50-foot waves as it struggles home.Peterson tries to create another `Das Boot' but comes up a little short this time.  In many regards, it is superior to his most famous film.  `Perfect Storm' has the most amazing visual effects of a storm at sea ever created.  It is to hurricanes what `Twister' was to tornadoes, and then some.  You get a vivid understanding of the awesome power of nature and how puny we really are by comparison.  Peterson attempts once again to get us emotionally involved with the characters by offering various character studies that humanize them.  In this regard, he was not as successful as in `Das Boot' and it leaves the film just short of greatness.The film throws in a non sequitur of a subplot by adding the Coast Guard's sailboat rescue.  Though this was some fabulous footage, it had no real relevance to the main storyline.  The time would have been better spent doing more character development and crew interaction scenes to bind us to the characters.What Peterson does better than almost any living director is to create suspense.  `Perfect Storm' is a white-knuckle ride from the first thunderbolt.  In scene after scene, you are climbing out of your seat with every muscle tensing as the crew performs yet another death defying act to stay alive.The acting was wonderful by the entire cast.  Clooney played his typical proud tough guy role with much more of a rough-hewn look, and was perfect for the role.  Mark Wahlberg turns in another fine performance bringing both strength and sensitivity to his character.  John C. Reilly gave a supporting performance as good as any of the stars.  This film got a lot of criticism because it didn't have a happy ending.  Well, the film ended the same way as actual events, so I really fail to see how that is a valid criticism.  It is also effective symbolism, as it shows the futility of the human struggle to conquer the forces of nature.  The scene of Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) helplessly bobbing alone among the fifty-foot swells drives that point mercilessly home.I rated this film a 9/10.  What it lacks in story development, it almost completely makes up for in visual effects and suspense.  I highly recommend it.

We get to know them a little, and we see that they are average  guys who are trying to make a living in a very dangerous job.  George Clooney is Captain Billy Tyne  and he brings a ruggedness and down to earth quality to the film.  He lets us know what it's like  to captain a swordfish boat.  The responsibility, the plotting, the navigating and the cargo  they're searching for all rest on his shoulders.   Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays another  swordfish boat captain who has an admiration for Tyne.  The scenes between these two  illustraits the allure of the sea.  Once the Andrea Gail sets out on it's final voyage, we see what  a chore swordfishing is, and the hazards involved.  Not to mention the long hours and dangerous  conditions on the open sea.  Once the storm hits, things get crazy.  Ships are tossed around like  they were nothing and in one of the more intense sequences, we see a rescue at sea and just how  dangerous and nerve wracking that can be.   The Perfect Storm is a story about everyday men,  battling the overwhelming power of the ocean.  There is a Hemmingway quality to these men.   They live life to the fullest, and they soak up every minute of it.  Hemmingway always wrote  stories about man against nature, here we see real life men battling nature, and you realize that  you don't have to be wealthy, a sports star, or anything else to be a hero.

But the attempts at character development are overplayed and unbelievable; the actors, despite their 5-o'clock shadows, simply aren't believable in the role--not because of any prior work they've done, but because they are too articulate and well-spoken to fit into the confines of the roles.

Frequency is my favorite but this is very close. A day before seeing Perfect Storm I had just finished reading Sebastian Jungers book. I found the book to be, well, 3.75 out of 4 stars lets say. A very good book. Then I got home and read countless comments and reviews of this film. I think I would have enjoyed the film even more if I hadnt. Not because it spoiled the movie, but every time I got to a part someone complained about I was thinking about their complaint and not 100% the film itself. The Film  This film is never boring, and also the melodrama was just right. Also its plot is NOT subpar, it is very good actually; it follows the book fairly closely (much more so than most movies based in books). A lot of things that occurred on the ship in the film were based off of things in the book that happened not necessarily on that voyage but things that Longliners in general have faced that where described in the book. At the very least this movie is an excellent visual companion to the book. Even the fishing scenes where entertaining as it helped further Jungers descriptions. But I think it more than stands on its own as a film.The acting is solid, and the costuming is great. These guys looked the part. None of these guys showed any traces of hollywood glamour. I never complain about botched accents because that is not an issue with me. I can't say myself how close they where but it doesnt detract from the film regardless. The character development is effective; this isnt a character study of fisherman, its a depiction of the effects of a superstorm and the attempts of a few humans to live through it. Also there are quite a few to develop and unless you want a 3 1/2 hour movie this about as good as your going to get. Which is still more than adequate. I do agree that the TV weatherman was kinda cartoonish but he is on screen for maybe 2 minutes tops so it isnt a detraction at all. The subplots involving the rescuers were all very good, a few minor changes where made from the real facts in those (namely the timeline of actual events and the names) but none that detract from the film. The characters of the subplots werent really introduced, and if it wasnt for the fact that those parts where based on true fact and vital to the book I would say these parts were filler. But what exciting filler it would have been! These where very confused scenes (in a good way) which gave an excellant portrayal of the difficulties in off shore rescues, especially in a hurricane. And they where very faithful to the descriptions in the book.On the other hand the Andrea Gail's experience in the storm will never be fully known, so once again the filmakers used a lot of ideas from the book and depicted them in the film. I commend the film makers for not cooking up a bunch of stuff to have happen, choosing instead to use ideas presented in Jungers excellant book. The dialog has taken a few shots from critics but I think it was fairly good, not great but not bad. I think for this genre of film it is actually quite good in spots. A couple lines make sound kinda hokey but too often are taken out of context by critics. The conflict between Sully and Murph isnt adequatly explained, I recall it being explained in a line or two early on but I cant quite remember. I hear its because Sully had an affair with Murph's ex. This was created by the writers, in the book there was no ill will between Sully and Murph (in fact they even did the grocery shopping for the trip together), it was between Bugsy and Bobby if I recall correctly. Looking for great dialog in this film is stupid because that is not the purpose of this film at all. If you want great dialog wait for the fall when the movies are more geared toward dialog rather than adventure. As I said earlier the acting was solid. Much better than most action/adventure/disaster films (the god awful acting in Twister comes to mind). Clooney and Wahlberg were good, and the rest of the supporting cast (save Lane for a touch of overacting) was very good as well. The shot of Sully standing alone sobbing as the water flooded the hull was memorable. Peterson's Directing was very good, though a few more broad shots of the ocean with the Andrea Gail would have been nice, though I see he was going for a more close in style to help the audience feel the shock of the storm. I give this a 3.5 (out of 4) on its own as a movie and a 3.75 as a visual companion to the book. The storm scenes were top notch, and its ending was effective. Since it is well known before that these men die you brace yourself for it and in fact the impact is lessened, so it isnt fair to say that the film was ineffective at tugging at your emotions since the movie goer is already braced for it. It is still quite heartbreaking nonetheless. So really the only fault I can find with this film is the whole Sully vs. Murph thing. I have never seen a perfect movie and this was no exception. But this does a terrific job at what it intended to do, and it I highly recommend it, especially if you've read the book. A definite step above your typical July release.

I only have one complaint, though.  In the movie, the storm seemed to happen all at once and the rescues seemed to kind of blend into one another after a while. In reality, the whole ordeal was a little more spread out over time.  But, I suppose, concessions must be made in order to fit the whole thing into a space of roughly two hours.Overall, I was very happy with the movie.

My usual philosophy is, don't believe the hype but in this case I did (I'm also marking out for X-Men). What is the # 1 rule in writing a book or in making a film?  I don't know either...but a good place to start is in making people CARE about your characters.  Critics take shots at this movie because it takes some time to set up and show us the lives of the fishermen on the Andrea Gail...NEWS FLASH...if I didn't care about them, why would I care if they lived or died during the storm?  I was raised just off Cape Cod...I had lots of friends who lived near me whose grandfathers, fathers, uncles, cousins, etc...were fishermen.  This movie does them justice by showing that it ain't a glam-type life...it's backbreaking work (avg 15-20 hr days).  It's also a roll of the dice as to whether or not you'll make any money, let alone survive.  The critics who have made a living sitting on their dead asses sticking pins in other people's balloons have no idea what real work is like. Is the movie perfect?  Heck, no...it's got a few hmmmmm moments...but, overall, it's a great story, with a great cast doing justice to the memory of all the fishermen/fisherwomen who never made it back to tell the tale themselves.  Oh, and to the critics who rag on the actors concerning their accents, I lived in Mass the first 14 years of my life and I STILL talk that way 16 years later...am I faking it too?  Anywho, this is just my humble opinion...spend 6 bucks or whatever and judge for yourself.  I had a great time and almost puked because of how realistic it felt.  When that 100 foot wave (like in the poster) rolls in...I stopped breathing.  I also suggest you read the book by Sebastian Junger.

"},{"Title":"Decent Film, Great Effects (Spoiler)","Date":"7 July 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  I'll admit I knew little of the Andrea Gail nor her plight going into the movie so I was unaware of the outcome. First off the effects were astounding. The scenes of a large cargo ship (Aeolis) almost becoming engulfed by enormous waves really put the sea conditions during the storm into perspective.I've read comments about the subplots and parallel events not really contributing to the (development of the main characters)story and I can see their point. Those events do serve to create some aura as to the rest of the world while the Andrea Gail is battling the seas. We see the meteorologist analysing and almost wetting himself over the prospect of two storm fronts colliding, plus a dramatic Coast Guard rescue sequence which required some disbelief suspensions on the audiences part. I felt that these sequences (mini-rescues) were overdone.The three occupants of the Mistral were tossed around - the boat even rolled a couple of times and yet the old yacht owner and two women passengers were able to hold on. I found it amazing that it could be conceivable for one of them not to be washed away. Also it seemed easy for the Rescue helicopter to retrieve them despite a few failed attempts and the rescue basket becoming tangled etc etc the rescue ended up successful.Then the rescuers, with relative ease, were able to find and deposit them on a Coast Guard Cutter in order to turn back in the wicked conditions to try and find the Andrea Gail.I was relieved when they showed a failed refueling attempt by the rescue chopper. It sounds nasty but I know that refueling an aircraft in flight is not easy and if they had succeeded in what seemed like 150-200 kph winds I would have been forced to vomit. Now our super rescuers are human. The chopper crashes and 4 of the 5 chopper crew survive. There are a few more dramatic rescue scenes on this thread but thats it. The fact that the crewmen were able to swim to each other in 100 ft waves is another bone of contention but I've roasted this a bit too much.The other aspects of the movie I liked - the fishing town, wharf setting, rugged fisherman, old salt in the bar brought memories of my home province of Newfoundland (where the Grand Banks provided a fishery for 500 years until the moratorium)- made me a little homesick.I was put off that Newfoundland, nor Nova Scotia were mentioned as references during the satellite photos (They could have shown Halifax or St. John's along with New York) but then again this is an American film - I was surprised Canada was mentioned - hell the storm was probably our fault (Blame Canada). I don't know where in Hell Sable Island is and it wasn't even shown on the satellite image yet it seems to be the hub of the show - every ship is referred to as X miles SW/NE/W/E etc of Sable Island yet it could be at the North Pole for all I know.The fact that it was BASED on a true story and the geography was lacking is what fries my bacon here.But all that removed the story was good. The situations on the ship while more than likely fiction (Its based on a true story remember - doesn't mean every freaking event has to have happened), were good and added to the characters and their integrity/development. Despite the two quarrelling fishermen at each others throats they forgot that when either was in peril. Murph was pulled overboard and came within a hair of drowning yet his enemy Sully was the first to notice him not at his post and the first one overboard to rescue.Overall the story is good, characters are down to earth blue collar workers and played effectively by the cast. Wahlberg and Clooney work well together (Both Three Kings and Perfect Storm). I hope to see them team up again.I'm in line with the 7.5/10 rating. A little more work on closure of events and detail and this could have been a 9.

Because really his acting was on par with the others in this film; plagued by wooden language and scant character development, this film is a disaster.  Audience members laughed aloud at several points in my screening.  Others were yawning, but silently.This film has two very interesting dimensions.  First, the characterization of the dangerous business of commercial fishing is both informative and rich in intrigue.  It turns out this really is hard work, and life and limb are at risk.  The way the story highlights the actual fishing excursion activities is really interesting.Second, the rescue missions are quite engaging.  The storm, as we all expected, was energizing, despite the fact that we knew it was generated by so many bits and bytes.  Nonetheless, those waves did look big.  The coast guard maneuvers were exciting, and the coast guard actors played by far the most realistic roles.Cutting half of the pre-storm footage would have helped this film immensely. Alternatively, trying some real character development with other than dead pan dribble for dialogue delivery would really have spiced things up.  As a third option, I suggest animated characters.  At least then we wouldn't have to feel sorry for the real people whose acting careers were set back a decade by what looked to me like the weakest aggregate set of acting in years.Shame on Petersen's The Perfect Storm.

Imagine going to see Titanic not knowing the ship hits an iceberg and sinks at the end. Same deal.Anyway, The Perfect Storm started out a little slow but when the storm hit, things got intense and exciting. George Clooney played a very believable and stressed out Capt. Billy Tyne. Tyne was under some major pressure to produce some fish. He and his crew needed to make some money so they went WAY out and get caught in one of the weirdest and worst storm combinations in the history of meterology. The special effects during the storm were tremendous. The photography was tense and exciting as the crew of the Andrea Gail fight for their lives. Mark Walhberg's Bobby Shatford was a very likable character. Walhberg is really beggining to become a really good actor as he played Shatford with such feeling, it was almost too sad to see what happend to the character at the end.===READERS SPOILER ALERT===> And that's really why I rated the Perfect Storm a 7 instead of a 10. You spend the whole movie getting attatched to these characters, rooting for them to survive only to see ALL of them, not just one, not most, but ALL of them die. To those who remember the story of the Andrea Gail in 91, this is not a surprise. But for me, as a person who did not recall the story, it was a shocking finish. The tearful end to Mark Wahlberg's character was just the end of a bad series of events. It was truly a major letdown. The ending scene of the funeral with all the loveones weeping about the deaths of the crew was just gutwrenching. As we left the theater, there was not one happy, smiling face in the crowd. Every one was miserable because of the feelings the movie pulls out of you. ===END SPOILERS==> Despite the ending, this movie was a cinematic feat on par with the thrilling Twister.

I guess if they would've made him spread his arms and scream i'm the king of the world they would still fail to make that scene more ridiculous that it already is.The weak attempts to introduce villains to the story looked so out of place, no amount of suspension of believe will help you. In a misguided effort to make those villain characters believable, they are not even really really bad guys, they do some good things too, which ruins the whole purpose of such character in a film like that.Pretty much the same thing happens with every other element of the film. The love story, well, there are several of them, and none of them properly developed, which was probably adequate to the fact that all those stories are plain boring simple with no intrigue, yet the director feels that he has given the viewer enough to justify some really corny scenes we see in the end.Titanic was great because it has a great love story superimposed on a very realistic disaster. Note that I did not use realistic with the love story, just the disaster. Love story in Titanic was out-of-this-world fairy-tale. That fine detail is exactly what evaded the minds of the Perfect Storm creators. They pushed the concept of realism to the places which they should've left alone for the classic holywood type romance. They had such a great opportunity with the two key characters - two boat captains, imagine what a movie it could've been - sigh.But to top it all why, why James Horner did such a score. It is not that he can do only the type of music he did for Titanic. It is clearly not the case, the guy did Aliens! This was the biggest mistake. The movie has many good elements and if it was not for the music that forced me to compare two films I think I could have even enjoyed Perfect Storm.I will not rate this movie since if you manage to concentrate on the film and avoid comparisons it is quite solid film, but you are really taking a big chance here, pretty much like those fishermen did.

There has never been anything like it. The visuals are so outstanding, that you feel transported out of the theater and into the storm itself. When you stand up after the film, your legs feel wobbly, and you feel you have to adjust to solid ground again. The plot is fairly simple, six down on their luck fisherman, set out to make one more attempt at a big haul. As they head for home, they run right into the most powerful storm the world has ever seen. That's it. That's all you need to know. Ive hear a lot of people complaining about lack of character development. Let me ask you something. What was it that got you to see this movie. What was the hook that made you say I've got to see that movie! Was it the possibility of seeing complex characters, or intricate storylines? Hell NO! It was the shot of a 50 foot fishing boat heading straight up a mile high tidal wave!!! So since the focus of the movie is on that very type of thing, where's the problem. Think about this, there is no need for the characters to be deep. They were fisherman, they are very simple, normal people. You meet them and the people they love. You learn their reasoning for doing this very dangerous job. You learn why they venture into the storm. You care about what happens to them. What more do you need? there's actually two stories at work there. One being the fishermen, the other involving the crew of an Army rescue helicopter, and the perils they face during the storm. Both are cut together very well. As for the main cast, George Clooney is excellent, Mark Wahlberg doesn't have a lot to do, but what he does, he does well, John Reilly is great as Murph, and Diane Lane provides the perfect center of anquish for all those left at home to worry. (She's a babe too. Does the woman ever age? She's gorgeous!). The real star here is the storm itself. Industrial Light and Magic have really outdone themselves here. The turbulent sea is one of the most striking visuals I have ever seen in a movie. It looks completely real, and is blended perfectly with the live actors. I can't even put its magnificence into words. It has to be seen to be believed. The story of the men of the Andrea Gail is heroic and, ultimately, tragic. It is brought vividly to the screen in a film that is viscerally exciting, and emotionally powerful at the same time. I can't rate it high enough. 10 out of 10!!!!

Mainly responsible for that was Petersen's biggest mistake  casting George Clooney as the lead. Clooney's character is cold closed, empty and seems to be always somewhere else. The movie showed that even when Clooney is surrounded by the charismatic Marc Wahlberg, he does not dazzle like a movie star.

However the effects should only be used as a tool to aid in telling a story, not as a way to bolster a weak script or cast.The film didn't get me to care about the main characters, though it was working hard to do so. Syrupy sweet dialog got pumped up by an accommodating score that periodically dropped in some sweeping violins in an attempt for added emotional effect. Sorry, it just didn't work. Even some of the lesser characters seemed as if they were dropped in specifically to add more emotional punch, especially since they didn't particularly progress the story.When I saw the film's preview awhile back, I thought that this might be an interesting film to see. I has half right. The effects were great, giving you a you are there perspective. But the story was running all over the place, and not because of the storm.

Every review of Gi60S was bad, so we went to see the other choice.From the start, this was a film about real people.  It featured honest looking folk who weren't icons of beauty; fat people, old people, wrinkled people.  Unshaven with unkempt hair (and this was on shore, not out on the boat).  If only for this, it was worth the price of the ticket.The story starts off slow, you get to see what the Gloucester swordfisherman are about, how they make their money, how they spend their money; relationships both new, old and broken.  A feel for what is day to day life in that place and time.  The unfairness of business (the guy who owns the boat gets 50% cut of the entire catch, whilst sitting on shore counting his money) and the fickle nature of the industry (don't catch fish, then you don't get paid).Wolfgang Peterson's direction is remarkable; I must stress, I'm not a technical viewer of films, I don't know much about direction what makes a film 'good'; the only other WP film I've seen was Das Boot, and it was a harrowing viewing experience.  In The Perfect Storm, things happen that feel real, and dangerous.  The incidents on the boat show the special insanity that people who live their life out at sea must face in extraordinary weather conditions.  Books try to convey the power and majesty of the oceans; this film SHOWED you what they meant by 30,40,50 and 100 foot waves.   It was visceral. The waves grabbed you and said 'I can snap you like a piece of straw', then proceeded to snap things left right and centre.The people in the bad situations were very much full-on in trouble; this was no wimpy oh help, gosh, I'm getting a bit wet flick; it was an advertisement for how you would feel if you were in a situation where your main thoughts would consist of I'M GOING TO DIE OUT HERE.I liked the film.  It was a bit soppy at the end, but not too drawn out.  The warnings people made in other reviews, about the messy details of sword fishing (fish being gutted, packed in ice, etc.) are all too relevant;  All part of the reality this film is trying to depict -- best to put up with the few minutes of blood and guts and not dwell on the animal suffering that must be involved -)There is a lot more I could say, but as with all film reviews, it is better not to explain things, but rather to indicate what you'll get out of it if you see it yourself.

The film focuses mainly on the boat Andrea Gail and its crew. The ships real life captain is Billy Tyne, played by E.R. veteran George Clooney. He and his fellow crew members want to fish one last time before the end of the fishing season because they've been in a slump with their previous trips, and they need the paychecks. However, they are unaware of the dangerous weather that lurks close to them. And when they attempt to make their way home, they run into very rough seas. It takes a while for this part of the film to come, but it's well worth the wait. The Perfect Storm was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the same man who's last film, Air Force One, is one of my all-time favorite movies, and this film is just about up there in the same league. The special effects are terrific, and should get an Oscar nomination. Those high seas are scary to look at. The sound categories should be Oscar recognized too. The movie doesn't go for much character development, but so what! I've read some of what the critics have said about this film, and once again they're complaning about the characters (in a big event type of film) not being developed enough. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH! Why can't they for once just go along with it! I don't understand this. All that matters is that the film is well-made, exciting, thrilling, humorous (at times), and that it has some good performances from its cast. And that's exactly what it is. Why Chicago's popular film critic, Roger Ebert, gave The Perfect Storm ***1/2 stars. He likes it. One of Chicago's other film critics, Michael Wilmington (of the Chicago Tribune newspaper) gave it ***. After seeing the previews for The Perfect Storm and hearing that it was based on a true story, I really thought that this was going to be one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2000. Thanks to all the critics who gave it a thumbs down (and they're have been alot of them), it doesn't appear it will be an Oscar-caliber movie. I think all the critics who didn't like The Perfect Storm should have their heads examined.

Which is what makes the villians in movies like The Patriot and Gladiator seem a little bit convenient for the conflict making our leading men heroes.

This isn't a film where the characters are as complex as those in Magnolia.  I mention this only because of the past comments on this site bashing it for it's bad character development and lacking script.  If you are one of those people - pull your head out of your ass and look at the films title.As for the characters the acting is superb.  George Clooney and Mark Whalburg are together again and do an excellent job.  We really believe that they are in a storm by all the moments of hesitation, faces of fear, and the tension of their verbal fights.  Some may be surprised by the familiar faces surrounding the boat.  John C. Reily - a highly praised actor from those familiar with Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant work (myself included).  Mary Elizabeth Mastriano (?) from Robin Hood and The Abyss.  John Finchtner in another supporting role.  There is even a brief performance from Michael Ironside.  But one of the films very best performances is by Diane Lane as Bobby's wife.The special effects might be the films most talked about moments.  It spends well over an hour with the storm and it's so hard to believe that the actors are just standing behind blue screens for some of these scenes (tanks and wind blowers were also used to a large extent).  In some gripping scenes such as when Billy (George Clooney) has to snap off the anchor we wonder how in hell this was filmed with so much going on (the crew watching their captain, the captain on the crane, the anchor flying around him left to right, and of course the waves behind him while some nearly knock him off the boat).  These moments are done with skill from the ILM team, but also to the great stunt-men who nearly double the size of the cast.Warner Bros. obviously wanted this film to hit big, which it will.  But I find it rare for a film like this to be released over the 4th of July weekend.  While it's big on special effects and budget, the film is more gripping and intense for most blockbusters that are released around this time (The Patriot included).

Unfortunately, The Perfect Storm left me feeling completely ambivalent about what had happened on screen.  This film is nothing more than an exercise in groundbreaking visual effects set to a roaring soundtrack and James Horner's standout score.  The opening half gives us the usual mix of cliche-ridden eclectic characters and corny dialogue.  As they set out to sea, we know very little of who these men are and what they leave behind.  This matter is worsened by almost hollow performances from every person on the boat and largely scream and cry exercises from the cast of loved ones left to watch the Weather Channel and sip beer at the local bar. So when the storm does hit, there is nothing left to do but watch and marvel at the show.  The characters are largely indistinguishable from one another throughout most of the storm sequences and, sadly, it wouldn't matter if we saw what was happening to who.  When the film moves to the rescue of a sail boat and a coast guard helicopter crew, characters who are never introduced in the story, we care even less than we do for the crew of the Andrea Gail. The film rings hollow and empty at the end when it shouldn't.  Even more insulting is that this movie is based on a true story.

STORM is based on a true story that occurred back in the fall of 1991, where two powerful storms made a collision with a tiny fishing boat named the Andrea Gail caught in the middle. In 1991, the Andrea Gail was falling in it's business with catching fish.  It's captian, Billy Tyne (George Clooney) didn't want to give up until they return with a good load of big fish.  His crew agree that they do need the money also, but they have other problems also.  Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg) is being convinced by his wife Christina (Diane Lane) to leave the fishing job and start a business in Flordia.  Dale Murph Murphy (John C. Reilly) is going through a divorce, and would like to get custody of his only child.  Alfren Pierre (Allen Payne) a Jamacian who traveled up north to catch more and bigger fish.  Mike Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes) is afraid to be alone, so he tries to strike up a relationship with one of the not-so pretty town locals (Rusty Schwimmer).  And there's David Sully Sullivan (William Fichtner) the outcast of the group, who wants to make the extra money, and is in a heated feud with Dale Murphy. The fishermen decide to make a last minute trip to catch bigger fish so they can return with more of profit.  But little do they know that one of the biggest storms in recorded history is building up, and it's what seperates the fishermen from their homes.  A few hundred miles south, a yacht with Alexander McAnally (Bob Gunton) and Melissa Brown (Karen Allen) is in distress also getting caught in the storm with the coast guard making attempts to rescue them.  But the crew of the Andrea Gail decides than to rather to let their fish spoil, they give the go ahead to go through the storm, despite the warnings from another captian, Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) telling them to turn back. STORM is the most enjoyable suspense movie that I have seen since RONIN and the original MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.  While watching this film, my heart was racing with the tenison and suspense.  It's rather a shame that Wolfgang Petersen didn't direct MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, since that film lacked suspense. But with PERFECT STORM, he takes a story that might appear slow or boring on the pages, and turns it into the most frightful film at sea since the original JAWS. The pacing is very well done, most people will complain about the first thrirty minutes of the film is slow.  But, I thought it was well done, since it builds character development so you would care for these fishermen.  Petersen turns these fishmen into real people and not cardboard disaster characters. But after the thirty minutes, the remainder of the 130 minute film is turned into a rollercoster ride from Hades. Granted the effects in this film are exceptional, but I would also like to recognize the editing and cinematography. The editing is not too fast to make a headache, and not too slow to drag. It's at the right pace to show their terrors of the storm, and the reactions of the people's faces.  And the scenes where the storm is building up, is both at times scary and beautiful, similar to the nothing in Petersen's other classic, THE NEVER ENDING STORY. And the acting is also very well done.  Leave it to George Clooney to hit another home run with a excellent film. And Mark Wahlberg can add another great film on his list, along with BOOGIE NIGHTS and THREE KINGS.  And the support from Diane Lane, John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio make this a above average disaster film. I should also give strong credit to Wolfgang himself.  From DAS BOOT, to NEVER ENDING STORY, to IN THE LINE OF FIRE, and AIR FORCE ONE, he is at perfection when it comes to directing a film in each different genre.  I would say this film is Petersen's almost perfect film, just behind DAS BOOT. But this is a film that Petersen should be proud of, he did a excellent job with it. For the summer movies, once in a while, a highly intelligent and fascinating film will be released.  Such films as JAWS, STAR WARS, RAIDERS, BACK TO THE FUTURE, FORREST GUMP, APOLLO 13, CONTACT, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and GLADIATOR are the above average typical summer films, films with spectacular scenes and a fantastic plot.  THE PERFECT STORM will be added on that list of the films above, and Petersen should be nominated for best director come next Febuary.

It easily outclasses Gone in 60 Seconds (which opens in Australia on the same day).The plot is pretty basic.  Maniacal sword fish boat captain heads back out to try and make up for some disastrous recent trips.  Pig headed captain ignores most of the dire weather reports and heads into it anyway.  Cue dramatic rescues and lots of heroic action.The last half centering around the rescue is very well done, but you would expect that from Wolfgang, who made diamonds from coal with 'Air Force One'.The action is split up into four areas, and the story wanders in and out of these events.  We have the fishing boat, we have the coast guard boat, we have the rescue helicopter, and a sailing boat that gets caught up in the fun and high seas.Now don't go and see this film if you are seasick in any way.  The waves are high, and Wolfgang uses some spectacular shots to give the impression you are there, rocking on the waves with our heroes in peril.This also aint the film to see if you are in any way squeamish about the slaugtering of fish.  The film revels in the boats capturing and gutting of its catch.The Perfect Storm is a great film, promising a lot of action and certainly delivering.  George Clooney, is good, but somewhat unsympathetic as the boat captain.  Offsiders Mark Whalberg, William Fichtner, John C Reilly and John Hawkes all offer credible support as the boats crew.Go and see it on the big screen.

But when massive hurricanes collide, peril and major special effects follow.  The premise is not half bad peril or pride?  Keep going to get fish, or return home as losers?  However, after about 65 minutes, the film begins to lose its edge.  For the remaining piece of the movie, all we see is a stormy sea, with nothing new really happening. Also, a subplot dealing with the Coast Guard during the storm is out of place and takes up too much screen time.  The movie is overdramatic as well. Nearly every time a character speaks, cheesy, weepy music is played.  The dialogue, which fills the weepmusic time is sub-par and can be found in any disaster movie.  These are all the traits of a bad film.  As a New Englander, I cannot forget to mention the terrible, fake Boston accents coming from everyone.However, we must also look at the bright sides of things.  There are many grade A actors in The Perfect Storm.  Clooney, Wahlberg, Reilly, and the other members provide worthy performances.  I also have to give credit to all the cast and crew of The Perfect Storm because I know the film could not have been easy to make.  All of the actors on the boat became very sick because of the violent sea, and the boat apparently administered many physical beatings.  The numerous special effects do provide entertainment, and the friendship between the members on the Andrea Gail appears real.Overall, Wolgang Petersen's Perfect Storm is par for the course in a mental aspect, but the physical action is adrenaline-pumping and exciting. For those who do not mind a screenplay which a monkey could have written, and a storm that seems endless - see this movie!  I guarantee you will enjoy some of it.

Clooney's character isn't explored enough and apart from Wahlberg/Lane, this can be said for most of the characters here.Bob Gunton and Karen Allen appear later on as members of a yacht caught in the storm but they aren't given much to do and much of the dialogue is pretty average and clichéd (pretty odd for a film based on a true story).In conclusion this film could have been better as with the explanation above but watching the film is a far cry away from being a waste of time.

Sensitive to the put-downs, the low salary and with a sense of insecurity built up, he decides to take it back out and try it again, despite reports of storms and squalls that appear--at first--somewhat extreme, but which are not exaggerated in the slightest. There are the internecine squabbles among crew, acts of courage, dis-appointments, the regular highs and lows you would expect among a group of guys out on the high-seas on a fishing vessel. They still do not meet a satisfactory quota, and they decide to go into dangerous waters far off shore. This area is known to the fishing community as a very dangerous area, and it becomes all the more-so because of the weather. The storm hits, and it is unlike any normal--or regular--storm, which would be bad enough in and of itself. But this one has very serious and tragic consequences. There is a lot of action, a lot of tension, and it builds up to a point where you could find yourself on the edge of your seat. A very good film, though a little slow at times.

The director gives us a window into the lives of those men, whose lives were the sea who took them. George Clooney is perfect as the captain, Mark Wahlberg is fresh as one of his fisherman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio smart in her role as well as George Clooney's female counterpart. Diane Lane's role as the girlfriend really makes you want to cry, you feel her loss, her aching, her undying love for her man. For that, Ms. Lane deserves mention. I've watched this movie (own the DVD) numerous times and it never ceases to move me. It's sad and not so predictable...unless you know of the movie or book, you might not expect the ending.

Her delivery is so realistic and has such a sense of immediacy that you feel as though you are standing right beside her, totally engrossed in her dilemma.George Clooney gives an exceptional and convincing performance as Captain Billy Tyne.  He has a subtlety of expression that can speak volumes and easily break your heart.  He made me glad I did not have Billy's job. And, although, he needs no words to get his thoughts across, when he does speak, his timing and throaty voice can be totally entrancing.John Hawkes and Rusty Schwimmer shine.  Their reactions are so genuine that you can't help becoming more and more involved, and rooting for them to be happy.In addition, the music really helped to set the mood, both during and after the movie was over and the credits were rolling. I watched all the credits down to the end, just to keep listening to the music!I hate to say that I enjoyed this movie because it was so heartrending and about real people engaged in a life and death struggle while trying to earn a living, but I'm glad a movie was made to honor them and all that they and their families went through and other fisherman's families go through every day.

BOOKS ARE STORIES THAT UNRAVEL AT EITHER THE READER'S DISCRETION OR IMAGINATION.That being said and done. It still floors me that people expect movies to be anywhere near as in depth or intricate as the book. I can't tell you how many people walked out of The Perfect Storm saying `The book was better, the book was better.' No kidding. I loved The Perfect Storm, the movie was so entertaining. The story, the characters, the special effects were all top-notch. I was not bored for a second. This is the type of movie that once it gets going, there's no stopping it. Those of you expecting Twister at sea, you're gonna be disappointed, this one actually has a story.As the poster pretty much states, in the fall of 1991 off the coasts of Maine, the fishing vessel, Andrea Gail, encounters a storm that had never occurred in recorded history. I myself am from New Jersey(no wiseass comments either, I can hear them already) and was living there at the time this occurred. I have no recollection of this storm, whatsoever. Anyway, I just found my self amazed by the scope and magnitude of this storm, as it was portrayed in the film. Wolfgang Peterson(In the Line of Fire) handles the story and the impressive ensemble cast with style and grace. From my understanding, the novel(which I have never read) deals with the storm as an overall synopsis of the people involved. The movie takes a different approach, the movie revolves mainly around the six fisherman aboard the swordfish boat Andrea Gail.The ragtag crew consists of Capt. Billy Tyne(Clooney Three Kings, Out of Sight), rookie fisherman Bobby(Walhberg Boogie Nights, Three KIngs), career salty dog, Murph(John C. Reilly Boogie Nights, Magnolia) Jamaican Cassanova, Alfred-Pierre(Allen Payne New Jack City, Jason's Lyric), mousy Cassonova-wannabe, Bugsy(John Hawkes)plus last minute replacement, Sully(William Fitchner Go, Contact) Try say that three times fast.As the movie starts the Andrea Gail has had a run of bad luck with the fish. The characters are given their respective, although somewhat typical, set-ups and backgrounds. Capt. Tyne's looking for the big haul while flirting with rival captain played by Mary Elizabeth Masterantonio(Scarface, The Abyss). Bobby just trying to get enough money for his divorce lawyer, so he can marry his new girl played by Diane Lane(Murder at 1600, My Dog Skip). Murph is looking to spend more time with his kid and so on and so on. So before the end of the season, Capt. Tyne decides to give it one more shot. That's pretty much the set-up of the movie. The vast majority of you will not be let down by this movie, which will definitely keep me off of any fishing boats this hurricane season.

The characters are not explored in depth, but the screenplay does give us time to know them, and to see them as human beings. Although predictable and cliched, The Perfect Storm allows us to sympathize with them. This is due largely to the efforts of a solid cast, especially Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reilly. George Clooney is decent, but his character is rather two-dimensional, often coming across as some sort of megalomaniac.Alas, it was during the much-touted second hour of the film where I lost interest.

This is also the TRUE story of REAL rescue personnel who put their lives on the line every day. It is true that we will never know the exact fate of the Andrea Gail and her crew. However, Wolfgang Peterson took the stories that Sebastian Junger collected from survivors of other Gloucester fishing disasters and used them to show what MIGHT have happened to the Andrea Gail.The Air Force Rescue team really did have to abandon their helicopter. They really were rescued from the sea by the Coast Guard vessel Tamaroa. One of them died - Search and Rescue looked for him for about 10 days after he was lost. This was their JOB. These people are highly trained rescue specialists and to mock them and their sacrifice is a disgrace.Clooney, Wahlberg and company did a beautiful job as Gloucestermen on their final, fateful voyage. They didn't play it larger than life, they played it as if they truly were the people they were portraying.A little more factual information. The Andrew Gail was a 70 foot steel boat. If indeed a wave swamped her as shown in the movie it would have had to be over 100 feet high. Recording buoys in the area that she went down showed super-waves of over 100 feet and wind speeds over 100 mph during the storm.For reality...a 10. For special effects...a 10. For the actors...a 10.

The volume jumps around a little (a personal pet-peeve of mine), but the sound effects and computer graphics on the waves are magnificent.  The only thing that bothered me was the constant jokes and ego-boosting coming from the group of teenagers near me.

This film deals in general with that storm, but specifically with the 6 men on the fishing boat who fought the storm and lost.George Clooney is good as the captain, Mark Wahlberg (29) as the crew member who wanted to stay on shore with his girlfriend, played by Diane Lane (35). The first half of the 125 minute film deals with development of the various characters, and their preparation for the next fishing trip 2 days after returning from a so-so effort that got the boat's owner doubting the captain's ability to find fish.The second hour deals with the storm and their efforts to survive. They could not have predicted the storm, but they might have been able to steer away if they had not been so obsessed with bringing home a great catch, both for the captain to prove himself still worthy, and the crew members to get a large $$$ slice of the catch.The DVD is great, and the surround sound was used to envelop us in sound during the storm. The extras are very good too.  In them you find that many of the townspeople of Glouster, Mass were interviewed and their ideas used to make the film as realistic as possible, including family of the lost sailors. Included are videotape shot during the actual storm in 1991, both from land and from a boat near the storm.I found most interesting the set they used to film the fishing and storm scenes.  It was in a very large tank build on a soundstage. The whole fishing boat was attached to a large, remotely-controlled, gimbal mount that allowed them to pitch and roll the boat, while spraying or dumping water on it.  The background was blue-screen 360 degrees, so in post production they were able to seamlessly put in real and CGI backgrounds, including the very large waves that dwarfed the fishing boat.  From comments from the actors, filming this way was just about as bad as being in a real storm. As Wahlberg said, I'd say a couple of lines, then (barf), then a couple more then (barf).The real charm in this film is the factual basis.  Of course it is impossible to know for sure what the crew went through, because they were all lost at sea, but the dramatization was very good. A note at the end said 10,000 men had been lost at sea from Glouster since the 1600s.  And that's how the film started, showing a wall with the names of men and the year they were lost. In the last scene, it showed 1991 and the 6 men depicted in this film.  Almost rated it 8, but a very strong 7 from me.

However, it was also badly distorted by the influences of Hollywood.","Date":"20 August 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  The Perfect Storm is an extremely difficult kind of film to make. No matter how you approach it, the budget is going to have to be huge, and there will definitely be some scenes that will simply be impossible to film on location. Hence, special effects are necessary. Given that, even though I generally feel that less is more as far as special effects, I respect the extensive use of special effects in this film. Without computer generated images, this film would never have been made. However, it should be noted that the convenience of special effects led to a high degree of questionable and, at some points, laughable excesses which were portrayed on the screen during The Perfect Storm. It was hard enough for me that every single external shot was obviously computer generated, but then the activities of the waves themselves during the storm were exaggerated to ridiculous proportions. First, yes there are waves that get that big and much bigger every day in the open ocean, but they are also several miles long. The constant straight up and straight down of the waves in the film is simply not true. However, when these waves collide, they do create very tall and very steep waves called 'rogue' waves, as they were called in the film, but these were pretty much the only kind of waves ever shown in the whole movie. Obviously they are more dramatic to watch, but they are not a continually occurring phenomenon. Even worse, I noticed a few scenes where obscenely huge waves (it is physically impossible for open ocean waves to be that big without a tremendous force like an earthquake, by the way) were shown completely motionless for seconds at a time. It was like the wave was some huge solid form just under the surface, and the water was just running over it. And then there was the wave that broke and toppled the Andrea Gail over longways (yes, I'm talking about the wave that George Clooney was screaming at). Waves just do not break like that in the open ocean, especially not waves as tremendous as that one. Basically, the storm scenes were simply exploded to impossibly huge proportions, which was one of the many ways that Hollywood manipulated this film.The other major problem concerned some of the things that were added into the story to make the film easier for a mass audience. (spoilers) This is not a happily-ever-after film, it's a true story. Everyone dies. So what they did was they had things like Bobby Shatford's (Mark Wahlberg) monologue to his distant future wife (...it's only love...), and of COURSE, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) deliberately allows himself to be taken down with the ship. How perfect. I'm not saying this didn't happen, maybe Tyne really went down as the traditional captain should, and maybe Shatford really did attempt a bit of telecommunication, but that is irrelevent. The point is that we don't know what happened, everything that you see in the second half of this film is pure speculation, and it is heavily sugar-coated, which bothers me. They even went to the extent of portraying the characters as though fishing was something that they needed just as much as food or water. Remember the scene when Cpt. Tyne says Let's go fishing as they are beginning their final fishing trip? All of the guys get so excited that you would think they'd just heard that they won some kind of world sword-fishing championship. That scene, by the way, establishes the they died doing what they loved layer of sugar-coating. How sweet.I'll be the first to honor the reality of the tragedy portrayed in The Perfect Storm. In fact, the one Coast Guard paramedic that died in the rescue attempt, whose real name was Rick Smith, was a close friend of my father's the year before this mission took place. They worked together in the National Guard for years, they even shared a desk. When they were moved, my father was stationed in California and Smith was stationed on the east coast,  where he soon received his fateful assignment. If it had been the other way around, it could easily have been someone portraying my father in this film. Clearly, I have a bit of an emotional bias toward this film, but I think that it was a little too excessive, particularly in the special effects department and the Hollywood sugar-coating. It's a great story and an entertaining movie, but I just don't think that it needed to be blown up that big in order to adequately portray the events that took place in the Pacific that year.

With out-of-this-world special effects, a touching human story, a wonderful director, and a star studded cast (including great actors like George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, Karen Allen, Michael Ironside, John C.

The pre-release hype and marketing was very intense and impressive, but everyone has done a great job in making an entertaining out-and-out blockbuster that has both heart and is also respectful to the real story and people of the real tragedy.

The film contains ideas that present themselves with amazing special effects, but go nowhere because the special effects are the subject of the film. Instead of crafting a motion picture in which defined characters pursue a path bombarded with conflicts, screenwriter Bill Wittliff creates an excuse to place characters in a situation laden with conflicts-and a horrible excuse at that.The film, based on a book established by a true story by Sebastian Junger, takes place at Gloucester, Massachusetts in the Fall of 1991. Determined captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is experiencing a slump in his normally successful fishing career. His boss is not happy with him, so when he decides to head for the plentiful grounds of the North Atlantic on the Andrea Gailand, he promises to bring back loads of fish.Billy's crew is not glad to head out to sea for the second time in the past week, having to again leave their families and lives behind. The young and lively Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg) and his fiancée, Chris (Diane Lane), have just purchased a new home for their upcoming lives together. Chris does not want her love to go out to sea again, because she is fearful of the dangers. Other crew members, including Sully (William Fichtner) and Murph (John C. Reilly) have a rough time getting along with each other. Billy's navigator friend, Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), warns of upcoming bad weather, but the crew ignores her cautions and heads out to sea regardless.The film's characters are sloppily written and contrived. Each individual character has a depressing nature to them; most come attached with a soap opera type of cliché. The production's idea of character development consists of having the John C. Reilly character discuss heartfelt feelings about his divorce with his young son, and Mark Wahlberg complaining about struggles with his divorce to his ripe, weary new love interest who wants him to quit his beloved career in fishing. Diane Lane is profoundly overacted-and very poorly overacted may I add. George Clooney is all occupational; he contains no internal introduction, only shallow business motifs. Other characters are defined though their prominent desire to obtain romance, alcohol, sex, and success. These repulsive characters are so unbelievably exaggerated, sappy, and phony I chuckled at the insanity of it all.Tyne and his fishing crew encounter great success on their journey, bringing on a fortune in catch. Two weeks after their departure, however, as the film's tagline reveals an event took place that had never occurred in recorded history. Before that incident occurs, however, the filmmakers cannot resist adding in little encounters portraying dangers of the ocean. The events include a vicious shark attack, a startling fishing accident, and even dramatic human conflicts on board the Andrea Gailand. All these trends provide an increase in tension at sea, gradually building up for the forty-five minute climatic storm that features scene after scene of massive waves crashing against the petite boat in which our crew members are stranded. However, after the first ten minutes, the reckless waterfront becomes stale and tedious, reducing what little suspense the movie has into absolute boredom.There are several dispensable and undeveloped subplots included in The Perfect Storm. The human problems aboard the Andrea Gailand are completely disposable since the two characters who constantly bicker and fight have no justifiable reason to support their actions, not that we care about either character in the first place. There is also a story about a trio of characters on a sailing adventure for pleasure. This subplot is never introduced or expanded upon. This scenario plays such an important role in the production that it is a wonder why the filmmakers never bother to develop the characters or situations involved. Their present in the film is only to further examine the likelihood of the colossal hurricane approaching, but since we simply could not care less about the subjects, this side story goes unrecognized.The Perfect Storm is altogether superior filmmaking; from the overwhelming special effects to the atmosphere of men struggling at sea, the movies technical qualities are spectacular. Unfortunately, the filmmakers seem to know of the intensity created by such visual effects, and milk them for every penny they are worth-to the point where not even these special effects can induce thrills.The movie is dedicated to the many fishermen who tragically lost their lives at sea since the year of the perfect storm, 1991. It is mournful that so many individuals have died on their journey to bring fish to consumers everywhere, therefore, I will not make light of the true story behind this movie. As far as the actual film goes, however, I did not care a bit for the characters. As the waves of the endless ocean tower over their minuet boat hopelessly drifting among the tide, the most I could concern myself with is praying the neat fishing boat would make it to safety in one piece.The Perfect Storm is brought to you by Warner Bros.

The storm delivers 'perfectly'amazing movie effects, but it is not enough to compensate for the sloppiness in the script.  We are presumed to be truly interested in the personal side of the fishermen and the townspeople after merely receiving rudimentary introductions.  One character's inability to remember the name of a new acquaintance is perfect allegory for the audiences (lack of)interest in the town folk characters. Regrettably, we are left to wonder if a story following the story of Diane Lane or Marky Mark's mother might hold more intrigue than the completed film.  The Coast Guard scenes are sometimes spectacular, although again, seem totally disengaged from the rest of the film.  There are a couple of very nice supporting roles in the film; however, I found myself chuckling at Karen Allen's role.  Most of her (few)lines are left inaudible due to the dramatic effects of the storm.

George Clooney leads a terrific cast of stars and acting veterans in this tale of man against nature, based on a true story.Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is a sword fisherman who has had bad luck of late.  He is determined to bring in one large catch before the season ends so he takes his crew far offshore to the Flemish Cap, a place where the fish practically jump into the boat.  They fill the boat, but the ice machine breaks down, making it impossible to keep their catch fresh for long.  So, they head for home brimming with fish.  Unfortunately, nature has other plans and kicks up the mother of all hurricanes.  The rest of the film is an epic battle of man against nature, as the little fishing boat fights high winds and 50-foot waves as it struggles home.Peterson tries to create another `Das Boot' but comes up a little short this time.  In many regards, it is superior to his most famous film.  `Perfect Storm' has the most amazing visual effects of a storm at sea ever created.  It is to hurricanes what `Twister' was to tornadoes, and then some.  You get a vivid understanding of the awesome power of nature and how puny we really are by comparison.  Peterson attempts once again to get us emotionally involved with the characters by offering various character studies that humanize them.  In this regard, he was not as successful as in `Das Boot' and it leaves the film just short of greatness.The film throws in a non sequitur of a subplot by adding the Coast Guard's sailboat rescue.  Though this was some fabulous footage, it had no real relevance to the main storyline.  The time would have been better spent doing more character development and crew interaction scenes to bind us to the characters.What Peterson does better than almost any living director is to create suspense.  `Perfect Storm' is a white-knuckle ride from the first thunderbolt.  In scene after scene, you are climbing out of your seat with every muscle tensing as the crew performs yet another death defying act to stay alive.The acting was wonderful by the entire cast.  Clooney played his typical proud tough guy role with much more of a rough-hewn look, and was perfect for the role.  Mark Wahlberg turns in another fine performance bringing both strength and sensitivity to his character.  John C. Reilly gave a supporting performance as good as any of the stars.  The film offers effective symbolism, as it shows the futility of the human struggle to conquer the forces of nature.  Scenes of people helplessly bobbing among the fifty-foot swells drive that point mercilessly home.I rated this film a 9/10.  What it lacks in story development, it almost completely makes up for in visual effects and suspense.  I highly recommend it.

The set-up - a late season fishing voyage sailing much farther out than anticipated, then being forced to hurry back to port due to a malfunctioning ice machine - may seem like a scriptwriter's invention, but it was all quite true to the facts.   Unfortunately, the film fails to emphasize the motivation for the fatal decision to brave the freakish weather.   It should be noted that coastal New England was badly hit by the early '90s recession, and the anticipated paycheck may well have been all that separated the fishermen and their families from an off-season of dunning calls and scrimping, the hell of our consumerist society.   Instead we have Lane, as Walberg's sweetheart, planning to use the money to improve their lifestyle, not just maintain it.  Such a factor is just enough to shift the critical decision to attack the storm from one of desparation-inspired courage across the thin line to one of foolhardiness.  The film also took up much of its running time with extended scenes that distract from the plight of those in the fishing boat - the story of the air-sea rescue teams (who deserved their own film)and the Boston TV weatherstaff, whose actors seemed to have been hired on their ability to make popeyed looks at the monitors.    The film is also an illustration of the dangers of filming something too close to the actual events, and using real-life characters freshly remembered.  No one is drawn to be too bad or irresponsible, no doubt due to fear of lawsuits from surviving relatives.   The result is that the crew of the boat comes across as rather bland, and their interaction miss the Pequod-type drama it should have had.

What best sums up this film may be the wily old mariner that sits at the bar in an early scene. Rather than show us the townsfolk of Gloucester, MA and giving us a feeling for the mood of the location, like, for example, in Jaws, this film throws all that away for a cliché Hollywood drunk old fisherman. All he lacked was an eye patch and a parrot on his shoulder.Old Man - Arrrr, the sea's she's an unforgiving wench. Shiver me timbers, 'taint seen a squall this bad since '64 (glug glug glug glug glug)The original story that inspired this film is fascinating. The Discovery channel's (?) 1 hour documentary on the subject was far better. I know Wolfgang Peterson directed 'Das Boot', so call it a conspiracy, but bad directing ruined this movie. Grant it, he was working from a screenplay with some laughably bad dialog, but nonetheless, all that could have been fixed. The glaring fact remains; virtually every decision made by the director was the wrong one. Here are just a few1) Bad and distracting music (the sweeping 'This is an epic ending' strings began to swirl within the first five minutes and didn't stop until 1/2 hour AFTER the credits) 2) Too many close ups and at inappropriate times 3) Confusing subplots which never tied into the main story and could have been easily cut out 4) No character development (a rift between two leads is established without ever explaining why) 5) Inappropriate emotions displayed by characters. Clooney's love interest, if you could call it that, is doe eyed and smitten from the moment they begin talking, leaving the relationship with nowhere to go but down. It also makes Clooneys pitiful 'love of the sea' speech clearly for the audience rather than her. Another example of inappropriate emotions is the lack of fear from the crew at their state of peril. Not a word uttered to God for help? Preposterous. 6) Too much camera movement (sit still and let us watch the actors suck!) and... 7) Believe it or not, ineffectively conveying the full fury of the storm! The actual event had some of the biggest storm waves ever recorded. In real life the rescue helicopter had to hover at about 100 feet above the water, and they were STILL nipped by waves! I never got that impression from the film. When the real crew had to bail out they had to be sure to do it just as a wave was cresting below them or they could have plunged 100 feet to almost certain death. Indeed one man did break some ribs his arm and his leg. In the movie the man that is injured appeared to jump the same 30 or so feet everybody else did and it is never explained why he was injured and the others not. Sometimes, good scripts are destroyed by bad directing. Other times, bad scripts are saved by good directing. This time, we have the frightful confluence of a bad script AND horrendous directing, making this the perfect waste of time. Dumkopf!

All the characters are two dimensional, the conjecture of what actually happened on the boat was laughable, and the dialogue is the worst I have heard in a long time. Yes the special effects are great, but when you don't care about any of the characters all thrills become as flat as a 3-day old soda.

I am glad I read all those bad reviews, because it turned this movie into even a bigger touching, heart-warming, adrenaline pumping, heart pounding, edge of the seat, spirit lifting spectacle. The Director of 'Das Boot' doesn't let you down. How people can even use the word 'boring' to describe this movie is beyond comprehension. Those people need to get some serious help.From very beginning the movie captures the mood of tough fishing town perfectly. The fact that when boats come back, and they not only bring fish back, but also dead bodies of the crew members, lets you know what kind of tough job and tough people we are talking about here. When Wahlberg's character after spending weeks at sea, working hard and risking life, gets his cut of two thousand dollars, you can see the despair yet toughness and determination on his face. Then the director spends some time introducing the characters, showing their strengths and weaknesses, their humanity, and their sense of humor, giving them depth, so that we know they are not some comic characters, but regular folks just like us. The crew heads to sea, not only to reverse their misfortunes, but to salvage their pride, to not to come back home busted again, to face their loved ones. They have more than enough at home to make them want to come back, yet they have more than money at stake in this trip, its their pride. These two points, series of misfortunes and hurt pride are the reason, they are determined even to take on Mother Nature's most powerful creation, The Perfect Storm.One of the great scenes is when the crew has finally decided to take on the Storm, and they are standing together at the edge of the boat, waiting silently and staring at the ominous thunder and lightning and demonic dark clouds, into which they are directly headed. That is the mother of all gut check moments, and this crew had plenty of it. Up until now, the expression 'at the edge of the seat' was only an expression to me, but during this movie I realized what it meant and how it was literally true. Till the last moment, when credits start to roll, you will be in danger of falling from your seat. The glorious effects will remind you of power of nature, and hence power of something or someone, more powerful than man.The movie is all about guts and courage, and how naturally, without a moment of thought or hesitation, courage and glory come to brave men and women. This is what it must mean to inspire courage and to lift spirits.As far as characters go, they are all very good. Wahlberg just keeps getting better and better. This man will have a stockpile of awards at his home before he is done. Mary Antonio has only two scenes, and she makes them both memorable. What an amazing actress!!! George Clooney on the other hand did a so and so job, and did not finish his homework. He and Diane Lane were either mis-cast, or not ready for their respective roles. They both got better as the movie went on, and in the end they are just as good as others, but during the beginning of the movie they feel like two fish out of water. Clooney does not appear to be a man who has lived a hard life, and who is under tremendous stress of failure. He seems a lot more educated, than he is supposed to be. He appears to be too sophisticated despite his poor shaving skills, as if he dropped out of Harvard, because he was bored with Med-school, and took up fishing as a relaxing and entertaining hobby. To all those who were complaining about the screen play, their complains are valid, but for wrong reasons. People are almost rooting for Shakespearean type theater, as if these characters who are clinging to their life by their fingernails should make deep philosophical observations about human existence. They are supposed to be blue collar fishermen for crying out loud. If any thing, they were shown to be more philosophical and sophisticated than they are supposed to be. Similarly in the case of Diane Lane's character, her mannerisms are of a Hollywood super model in the beginning, and her style of talking and walking and moving etc, all seem to be of a rich movie star, and not of a poor woman who has to stress about making two ends meet. She did not seem she had led a tough life either, and was banking her hopes on a good hardworking but poor guy. However, the best and most natural character Bugsy, provided all the laughs that were necessary.James Horner did his job. Had he done a bad job, then all those who are calling it a thrill ride, and yet dumping on him, don't realize if he had failed then it would not have been a thrill ride. The photography is just absolutely fantastic. This is a kind of movie that to truly enjoy it, you have to see it in theater. Small screen would ruin this movie. Right after seeing this movie, when me and my friend walked out, we felt so great, that had it not been late on a working day, we would have gone right back in to see it again. The most amazing thing is that it is a tragedy, yet the sheer courage of brave men and women to challenge nature itself, and to look death in the eye without fear, leaves your spirits as high as the final killer wave.Don't miss this movie, or you will regret that you payed attention to those whose idea of good screen play is long slow miserable asinine dialogues.

The results are equally rocky.This is meant to be a story of heroes, which aptly applies to the rescuers and families.

Studios keep their films about dying mothers with cancer and families that have to put up with those alcoholic fathers and psychological journies into the porthole of someone's mind, until the snow is on the ground here in Canada and the Northern U.S.A.  Summer films on the other hand, would take those same premises and twist them around so that the dying mother with cancer would be just a minor subplot for when the giant asteroid comes crashing to earth, the alcoholic father would be murdered by his son only to come back as a blood thirsty zombie and the porthole into someone's mind would really just be a porthole into hell where Jason and Freddy and perhaps the Grmelins rule together.  Winter films are praised for being risque and intelligent while summer films are chastised for being silly and sell outs.  But look at most of the top money making films of all time and you will realize that they came out between May 2-4 and Labour Day weekend.  Jaws, Ghostbusters, Indiana Jones, Batman, Independence Day, Lethal Weapons, Jurassic Park, E.T. All are brawny summer films.  The one exception, of course is Titanic, which came out just before Christmas in 1997 but that was such a great film that you could have released it in March and it still would have grossed almost 2 billion dollars.The Perfect Storm is another example of the summer film.  This is a film that has very little box office drawing power going for it, except that giant wave.  Clooney, Wahlberg and company are not box office giants but Warner Bros had great confidence in the film, so much so, that it hired an A-list director and it saturated the market with trailers and other forms of advertisments.  All of this built the consumer up with great anticipation and we were all dying to see it.  This was the one summer film that I have been looking forward to since I first began seeing clips of it about four months ago.  Now the big question is, does it deliver?  And the answer to that is a resounding YES!I think we can skip the commentary and summation of the story because it really doesn't matter.  In a nutshell, a bunch of fisherman get caught up in the biggest storm ever recorded and they have to battle mother nature. Simple enough story but its what they did with it that makes the film so compelling.  It's also funny, I have always thought that George Clooney could read the barf bag on an airplane and still make it sound interesting. But in The Perfect Storm, his role could have been given to anyone and the film still would have been great.  That is not a discredit to him, it is a credit to the rest of the film and those behind the scenes that were involved in it.  Much like Twister, the actors and the story take a back seat to the events and the special effects.  ILM and Wolfgang Petersen should be lauded as heroes for their work in this film.  I don't really have much to compare it to but the illusion that you are really at sea with these people is really quite the achievement.  Giants waves come crashing into the Andrea Gail, winds blow water mercilessly onto the boat and wreak havoc on it's passengers.  Thunder and lightning are omnipotent on this journey as well.  I can honestly say that my emotions were taken for a ride.  I was exhausted when I left the theater.  Even though we don't know the guys to well, we know them well enough that we care what happens to them.  There is also two other great sub plots as three passengers, on a small sailboat are caught down south in the eye of the storm.  And we also have the story of the heorics displayed by the Coast Guard and the other rescue team that attempt to rescue the Andrea Gail but fails.The Perfect Storm has a slow first thirty minutes.  And that is acceptable because you have to introduce the cast and the conflict and try to get some kind of emotion involved here.  In the beginning, we are introduced to Bob Brown, the owner of the Andrea Gail.  Played by Michael Ironside, I was thrilled to see him back in the movies.  I enjoy his work and even giving him a small role like this one was a credit to the film.  I also enjoyed seeing Karen Allen of Indiana Jones fame back in the saddle.The Perfect Storm has everything going for it, a great cast, a veteran action director and a giant wave that has a thirst for blood.  This is a perfect summer film.  It may only win some technical Oscars but the fact that it will probably go on to be one of the three top films of the summer should be quite the consolation prize.  This film has the chance of breaking 400 million dollars in the world wide box office and that should be all the recognition it needs.8.5 out of 10.... The second best movie of the summer so far.  If you can't enjoy this film, there is always the winter coming up very shortly.

What won me over first was the realism.  I believed these people were real, physically as well as on a character basis. kudos to the make-up people ;-)Being a movie-music buff, I pay attention to the score, and I enjoyed the score to The Perfect Storm quite a lot.  It was written by James Horner, who you will recognize as the composer of Titanic's score as well. (actually you could probably recognize it anyways because it sounds similar) There were moments that sounded like Titanic, but c'est la vie!Lastly, I would just like to add a little story that goes along witht the film.  The captian of the sail boat Mistral I believe it was, showed some resistence to being rescued. This was true in real life as well.  The captian was prepared to weather the strom.  After the hurricane passed, the captian hired a plane to search for his abandoned boat, and it was found, with only superficial repairs to be made.  Just goes to show to trust the old salt.

The book was never that cheesy in describing their relationship.  Other than that, I thought this film was flawless.  I had just finished reading the book beforehand, and was amazed at how closely it followed the events.  People complaining about character development obviously haven't read the book.  In the book, there is no dialogue whatsoever between the crew of the Gail.  It's all told by others who were in the storm.  There were a few scenes where I would of been a little confused, had I not read the book, but my friends didn't seem to notice.  One scene that I won't soon forget is the final wave the Gail hits, with George Clooney yelling Come on!!! Come on!! right into it's face.  I had goosebumps when that scene hit, one of the most unforgettable scenes I've seen.  The one scene that I thought was pretty amusing was how in the helicopter rescue scene, somehow throughout the turbulent waves and high winds, the copter manages to stay on top of the ship throughout.  The ship would of been blown to kingdom come.  Other than that, it was much more realistic than I would of thought.9 out of 10.

And all involved deserve great credit for making every effort to be respectful of the people portrayed in the story, and of the fishing industry itself.The storm scenes are absolutely phenomenally real.  You feel drawn into the action, and even though the outcome is never in doubt, there is strong suspense in many scenes.  You care about the guys on the boat, and you want the inevitable to be delayed for as long as possible.The performances are excellent.  George Clooney is a believeable, slightly obsessed captain.  Mark Wahlberg continues to impress as an actor, and John C. Reilly is the perfect likeable working guy.  William Fichtner is good too, but his Gloucester accent is a bit in and out.  The same is true for Diane Lane, who I like as an actor, but her accent is much broader in some scenes than others.The opening and closing scenes are a bit overly schmaltzy, but there's enough genuine feeling to make it work.  The only other problem I have is with a couple of anachronisms in the script.  Clooney makes a speech about why he loves being a sword boat captain, and he describes the areas the boat passes when leaving Gloucester Harbor.  One thing he mentions is waving to the lighthouse keeper's son on Thacher Island.  There have been no lighthouse keepers on Thacher Island in 20 years, and no families there since long before that.  And as the words are heard in the movie you see Eastern Point Lighthouse, not Thacher Island.  Sorry, I can't help it -- I research and write about lighthouses for a living.  Another anachronism -- Clooney says something to the crew about looking like they were in a brawl in Scollay Square.  The Scollay Square section of Boston hasn't existed in about 40 years; it seems unlikely that a Gloucester fisherman would make a remark like this.  I know I'm being picky, but for the most part the movie pays such close attention to detail that these things stand out for me.All in all this is a satisfying film and a worthy tribute to the generations of people who have worked and sacrificed in the fishing industry.

Based on a real tragedy, this movie takes the chance most movies don't of presenting a story without a happy ending.  (Or happy beginning or middle, for that matter.)  The setup is very slow, and the dialogue and acting is overwrought in the beginning; the producers were trying too hard to make the characters alive and human to us before their doomed voyage.  If they had made the acting and writing less poetic and more realistic, and shown us more facets of the characters, it would have made us empathize with them more.  Instead, it almost distances us with too much melancholy and not enough development, until they get aboard and we get involved in their grinding struggle.  It is difficult to get involved in fishing as a gripping struggle, but the career these men had is one of the hardest and most thankless in existance.  Focusing on the back-breaking grind of making ends meet and the pressures they are under is the real struggle they faced, not the fish, and focusing on that would have made us understand and empathize with them more in the beginning.  Instead we get a glimpse of that and too much romantic dialogue.  The special effects are intense and relentless for a very long time; the men struggle to survive, are thrown overboard, and rescued too many times before their inevitable doom.  Standing outside the entrance as the moviegoers left was interesting; they had the beaten, sad and exhausted look of the survivers of a very bad shipwreck, and many depressed and irritated comments were made on the way out.  The movie breaks a rule Alfred Hitchcock mentioned once (evidently speaking from personal experience)  If you have a hero who is struggling against death for a very long time and then at the end of that struggle have him die anyway, you will make your audience, very, very angry!In this case death was the reality of events, but the number of crisis these men faced (the protracted anchor struggle, men overboard, shattered windows to cover, several tidal waves, then the watery end) demanded too much of the audience.  All of the action scenes were great, but there were too many of them; in the end, it felt like being a viewer to a long, watery torture before the victims finally met their end.  Then, there is a strange mixture of anger and relief when they are finally put out of their misery.The overly-enthusiastic weatherman scenes following the storm's progress were annoying, feeling too intense and forced. The actors were all very good, but were lost sometimes in the effects (especially the coastguard pilots) and weighed down by heavy dialogue. The movie deserves to win a special effects Oscar at the very least. I can't imagine a movie coming along to top this in that regard.

While TPS is not bloody or gruesome, it does cause one's heart to pound and one's breath to come faster.

Of course, a story that is based on actual events can only have so much leeway, but the script wove a compelling tale, and even the parts that are speculation or artistic license help to develop the central plot, which remains as true to actual events as possible.I fear that 'The Perfect Storm' may be one of those films that loses a lot of its grandeur when viewed on the small screen, but it will always have the winning elements that make it a film worth seeing.

The trailers showed some Over The Top footage about huge waves, which made me very skeptical, but since there was nothing else on that night I had to watch this one. And I don't regret it! Normally, computer rendered moving objects, whether they be flying saucers, reptiles, space ships, helicopters (arrghh, the 6th day, with Arnold!!!), or ships at a stormy sea, all seem to only intermittently follow the laws of mechanics. Now, most people can't integrate the effect of an impulse on an object that's got a center of gravity and inertia of momentum, but we all still see that it somehow looks artificial. This movie is an exception. Of course, it helps that they had an excellent cast, very good acting, and a superb screenplay that in a subtle but determined way conveyed to us the atmosphere and the feelings of those who have to wait on mainland  for the news -- every time these guys go out. The documentation I've seen boasts about the crew and all spending a lot of time at the port of this true story. I can only wish that most other filmmakers did the same.

The next day I was so shocked at the comments and reviews that I went with a second group of people and tried to watch it again, hoping perhaps I just had an off day. It was worse the 2nd time. I have never seen such poor film work ever. Soon into the movie I assumed the film was matted wide-screen because I saw many scenes with the characters foreheads cut off at about the hairline. I was stunned when one of the big waves hit the boat and knocked the main boom over. I thought I was watching an old 60's Godzilla movie. And then as the perfect tri-wave storm begins pounding the boat the scene moves to the inside of the ship. The crew is anxiously deciding what to do. They are SLOWLY LEANING from side to side. And behind them, outside of the main windows are these 40 or 50 foot waves slamming down just feet from the ship. Nothing on the tables are moving etc. etc. This is not to mention that the scenes were too chaotic to really see what was going on. They also were shot in deep brownish hues that were far from natural. That's not even getting to the fact that there is never an attempt to develop any of the characters.

I also want to note that I was hoping that at a 2nd theater, the movie at would at least display a proper aspect ratio. Maybe the first show had over-scanned the projection so as to cut off the tops and bottoms of scenes. I was wrong. It was just as terribly displayed there. It is either being played back in 35 MM, matted to give us the 235 to 1 appearance of 65 or 70MM. Or it is just a terrible Camera man's eye for the scope of the viewer.

The script was obviously washed out to sea too as they made this pathetic sea shanty, with every stereotypical disaster cliché known to the most jaded summer movie-goer. With cute kids, wailing girlfriends, a weatherman who gets off on storm cells and a group of testosterone-driven fishermen, more intent on saving a load of frozen fish than their own stupid lives. How bloody ridiculous (and time-consuming!) Clooney has seen better days. Since the Titty Twister movie and Out of Sight, George has been pretty disappointing. This movie will do little to help. Every line George gets has him raving about being men, not little boys . For Gods sake, if they had the budget to recreate the giant wave from Deep Impact, they could have invested in a decent script, and a razor or two. George has even brought along his friend Marky Mark, who quite frankly I had more respect for as a new kid on the block. I cared so much about the rest of the cast, you could feed them to the fishes anyway. Director Wolfgang Petersen has done so much better than this with Das Boot and Air Force One. Where the hell was he going with this pathetic drivel? Even the music, by James Horner, was re-hashed themes from Deep Impact. They weren't content with just stealing the giant wave? So where are we going this summer. In my mind there has been one, and one only - Gladiator. The rest, including this, has been a bunch of brain mush. I feel like I'm being fed by the Hollywood food drip. Sucking people simultaneously into multiplexes all over the world and feeding them mindless epics like MI2, Gone In 60 Seconds (I certainly hope so) and this aquatic farce which should sink into the depths like the Waterworld it is.

That's the point, that's what the movie was about, and that's what the director brought across to the viewer. If you want a more accurate account of actual events then purchase the book, and read it, because the book goes into the individual personalities and the relationships between characters. As for the exact recount of the final moments of the crew of the Andrea Gale, according to the Official Coast Guard Report, the cause of this tragedy is unknown. Also unknown are the actual events, mechanical problems encountered by the vessel, and all interactions and communications among the crew. No matter what the movie communicates to audiences, the cause of this tragedy is unknown and will remain that way for eternity. That portion of the movie which takes place after the Andre Gail's final radio transmission is totally unknown and is purely fictionalized. I feel we can all make are own assessments on what happened and what was said. We do know the vessel sank and six lives were tragically lost. Therefore it really doesn't what the movie depicts.I appreciate watching a movie about six men who worked hard, battled the elements, battled the Perfect Storm provided for their families, and lost their lives in the performance of their jobs.

To be fair to the real people involved, this sort of Hollywood action should have been jettisoned, and we should have been treated to a more documentary treatment of the story to do the book justice, as well.  The closest we get to that is the painstaking recreation of reality through the setting, costumes, etc.  Why wasn't this the movie I wanted made?  Because an actual rotting swordfish would attract a bigger audience than a documentary about Gloucester fishermen.  Audiences want to see George Clooney and some special effects while they munch their popcorn.  This is also why the musical score is an intrusive element that lacks any subtlety, whatsoever.  Moviemakers are not so unlike fishermen in this regard, and they cast their nets where the shoals of patrons are, and must use flashy tackle to attract them.  If you are a little more discerning in your choices of entertainment, you probably would prefer the book.

Why did the crew wait so long to batten down the wheelhouse windows? They knew the storm was coming. They knew how bad it would be. Why didn't they make proper preparations to meet it? Why wasn't the crew in the wheelhouse? I've been in some bad blows, and when it gets really bad, everybody usually hangs out in the wheelhouse with their survival suits within arm's reach. When it's that bad, and the boat has to turn around in monster seas, riding out the turn in the fo'c's'le or galley is the last thing anybody wants to do.Why would anyone think they could remount a SSB antenna in a 50 knot wind when the smallest whip antenna is about 23'? If the antenna doesn't rip your arm off, how are you going to splice the coax? And why not just lay out an emergency long wire antenna on deck? Speaking of which I thought the Andrea Gail had a long wire antenna and not a whip antenna. I believe that in the photo of the Hannah Boden, which Linda Greenlaw states is a sistership of the Andrea Gail, you can see a long wire antenna running aft from the masthead to the goal post.By the way, Greenlaw states in her book that her boat, the Hannah Boden, was 100'. Sebastion Junger, the author of the book, stated on a pre-movie hype news program that the Andrea Gail was 80'. I tend to believe Greenlaw over Junger regarding LOA. And I tend to believe it had a long wire antenna. You'd think it would given its range of operation. Also, if the boat was 100' , the wave at the end would have been about 200'. My understanding is that the largest non-seismic wave ever recorded was 112', measured scientifically in the North Pacific by researchers aboard the USS Ramapo on February 7th, 1933.Also....Where can I get one of those blow torches that stays lit after it gets dunked in seawater? Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie. I liked the effects. I thought the film makers did some good things. But I don't think the movie paid homage to the crew of the Andrea Gail or commercial fishermen. I think Junger's melodramatic overspeculations of the sinking (not to mention his speculation about what it's like to drown) are an insult to the thousands of fishermen and other seafarers who've lost their limbs and worse in much less spectacular ways. In truth, the vast majority of commercial fishing accidents and sinkings, aren't caused by gigantic Hollywood waves. They're the result of separate incidents and seemingly insignificant details stacking-up and falling like a house of cards.With all due respect to the people of Gloucester and the friends and family of those who died on the Andrea Gail, and to the film makers and the actors, I humbly submit a different cause and effect scenario with regard to the sinking.In my opinion, had the crew been given the time depicted in both the book and the movie, the ending might have been quite different. Those men were experienced and capable fisherman who had previously handled anything the sea had thrown at them. What probably happened was they started home with a freighted boat. It got rough, very rough, and the vessel started taking on water, probably from some insidious place in the stern, e.g. the rudder box or shaft seal. They didn't know she was taking on water until it was too late, at which time the vessel rolled and sank before they could launch the raft, get into their survival suits, or trigger the EPIRB. How many times has it happened that way? A freighted boat. A slow leak. Bad weather.Of course, the enormous wave makes for greater popcorn fun.

Those were stereotypic stories of romance padding out an action scene or two. Should she affiliate with the lower-class guy? Which of two daring lovers should she choose? This one has half an hour or so of realistic introduction and the rest of the movie is slam-bang action.In the course of that introduction we meet the crew of the fishing vessel Andrea Gail and a couple of their friends as well. The introduction looks grounded in reality. George Clooney, as the skipper, is hounded by the penny-pinching owner of the boat and hopes to make a killing this time, no matter how far from from Gloucester, Massachussetts, he must take the boat. Then there's Mark Wahlberg as the younger crewman, who finally is able to make up with his angry wife, Diane Lane, just before departure. Then there are two guys who dislike each other and get into a fist fight at the bar. (Don't worry. One saves the other at sea and they get over their pique. Not that it does them any good.) One of the more attractive things about the film, based as it is (to some extent) on a real story, is that the characters don't have to overcome some exotic threat -- no horde of spiders, no Big Bug, no wanton lion, no flying saucers, no maniacal slasher in a Halloween costume -- just the normal, ordinary, everyday laws of physics. When you join two fluids of different properties together and move one across the other, you get waves. It doesn't matter if the fluids are air vs. air, air vs. water, or oil vs. vinegar.I'm more inclined towards action than the soapy romance of those other two Pictures of the Millennium, but there can be too much of a good thing. I mean, All Adventure, All the Time? I've never seen a perfect storm, although I was on the Carolina coast at the time and watched the wind around the margins clear away everyone's barbecues and dog houses from the back yards. But I can't believe that the lightning in this storm, even at its center, was of such frequency as to provide enough available light for the viewer to see just what was going on. The special effects are very effective but they're excessive too. Wolfgang Peterson was the director and he certainly knows how to handle ships at sea. The way he manages the effects, the acting, and the editing will certainly rattle your chain for you. The constant noise will leave you exhausted. It's a teeth-gnasher if there ever was one.I wish the writer had been equally effective but the truth is that the dialog is kind of sappy and formulaic. Take, for instance, the scene in which Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Linda Greenlaw, visits skipper Clooney in the pilot house the night before he leaves. Why are you risking so much?, she asks, and Clooney launches into this protracted paean to the sea. He stares out at the harbor and tells us what it's like to put out. First you take in the lines, then you pass Cape Sable light, you blow your air horn, then the birds come, first the black backs then the gulls, and you wave to the folks ashore, and you're in charge and the sea is beautiful and the world is at peace and your Krause end bulbs go into overdrive, and so on. Well, I don't believe a word of it. These are hard-working fishermen, experienced, and busting apart with testosterone. No seaman talks like that or even thinks like that, although a screenwriter sitting in his sunshine-flooded living room in Malibu might think he does. The script loved that dumb poetry so much than we hear it again in Clooney's post-mortem voice-over at the very end.There's another problem with the script too. Communications between Linda Greenlaw (who in real life is intelligent and articulate) and the Andrea Gail was lost hours before the boat presumably sank, so the writer is free to invent all sorts of dramatic events, and the dialog to go with them, and director Peterson is at liberty to show them in all their immediacy on the screen. There were times when -- between the constant lightning flashes, the omnipresent crashes of thunder, the frenzied score, the shots whose length could be measured in milliseconds, the shouts of the the distressed crew -- I completely lost track of what was doing what to or with whom. But I was able to get the general idea that if you can think of a cliché about a boat in heavy seas, you can probably find it here. Speaking of clichés, we have flung in our faces a grizzled old salt who warns of the distant fishing grounds that Clooney is taking his boat to -- Plenty fish. Plenty weather. I forget his name. Maybe Elijah something.I see I've kind of trashed this movie but I don't want to leave too bad an impression of it. It's mostly irritating because it COULD have been so much better if the script had only stuck a little closer to the kinds of interaction we've seen in the introductory scenes. The cast are just about right. Nobody looks glamorous. The faces are genuine -- rude and sturdy. Even Diane Lane isn't glamorized. They're ordinary people coping with ordinary issues. Nice job. Too bad that approach was thrown overboard later.

(The director, Wolfgang Petersen, was later to make Poseidon, a remake of the original Poseidon Adventure). Whereas those films dealt with ocean-going liners, however, the ship involved here is a small fishing vessel, the Andrea Gail, sailing out of Gloucester, Massachusetts. The film is based upon the book of the same name by Sebastian Junger, which was in turn based upon the true events of the Halloween Nor'easter, a storm which hit the coasts of New England and eastern Canada in October and November 1991.The film follows the characteristic two-act structure common to many disaster movies. (Dante's Peak and Titanic itself are other examples). In Act I we are introduced to a select group of characters with whom we can identify. Act II deals with the disaster itself, the main source of drama being whether or not those characters will be able to escape with their lives. In this case, of course, the select group is the crew of the Andrea Gail- the captain Billy Tyne, the young, inexperienced Bobby Shatford, divorcée Dale Murph Murphy, David Sully Sullivan, who has a long history of antagonism with Murph, Michael Bugsy Moran and the quiet Alfred Pierre, the only black member of the crew. We also get to meet some of their friends and relatives, including Shatford's girlfriend Chris, his mother Ethel, Bugsy's girlfriend Irene and Linda Greenlaw, the female captain of another fishing vessel.Many disaster movies, going back at least as far as The Towering Inferno and Jaws in the mid-seventies, have a simplistic morality; the disaster should be seen to be caused, or at least exacerbated, by human incompetence, complacency or greed. (In Titanic, for example, the collision with the iceberg occurs because the ship's owners, for commercial reasons, have ordered the captain to steam at full speed through the ice-field.) In The Perfect Storm matters are not so simple. The disaster which strikes the Andrea Gail is not due to the folly or wickedness of any one individual but rather the result of a complicated interplay of various economic and psychological factors, as well as a combination of meteorological ones which give rise to a storm of unusual ferocity. (One meteorologist described them to Junger as the perfect conditions for a storm- hence the title of his book).In the opening scenes the Andrea Gail returns to Gloucester with a poor catch. Desperate for money, and under pressure from the boat's owner, Tyne persuades his reluctant crew to join him for one further voyage, the last of the season. They head further out to sea than normal, heading for the Flemish Cap rather than the Grand Banks. They have great success at the Cap, but when their refrigerator breaks, Tyne and his crew face a dilemma. Do they hurry back home, and brave the storm which is developing closer to land, or do they wait out at sea for the storm to abate, which will mean losing their catch? Of course, they choose the former option (there wouldn't have been a film if they had chosen the latter one) and the rest of the film deals with their battle against the powerful winds and monstrous waves. There is also a sub-plot about the Mistral, a yacht caught in the same storm, and the efforts of the Coastguard to rescue its crew.The Perfect Storm is not quite the perfect film, but it is nevertheless a pretty good one. It missed out on a Best Picture Oscar nomination, although in my view it deserved one far more than the ghastly Chocolat, but was deservedly nominated in the Best Effects, Visual Effects category. This is not, however, a film which relies exclusively on special effects, good though those effects are. The human factor is also important, as all the crew become individuals we can identify and sympathise with; there are a couple of good contributions from George Clooney as Tyne and Mark Wahlberg as Shatford. This is one of the best disaster movies of recent years, better than Dante's Peak, in which the characters were less well developed, and on a par with Titanic. Although The Perfect Storm lacks the grandeur and epic scale of the earlier film, it has a more intimate, human feel to it and an equally moving conclusion. 8/10 "},{"Title":"This movie was great movie in many meanings.","Date":"18 September 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" I'd read the book and then saw the poster for the movie, so I was excited about seeing THE PERFECT STORM.

Whilst we were pretty sure of our position in general we were not sure if we were breaking up on the beach or the sand bar a few hundred metres off-shore. We had no choice, the boat was disintegrating around us, we had to leave the boat. Visibility was less than twenty metres. Taking that step out of the boat, knowing that if this was the sand bar and not the beach we would be dead in minutes, well you just can not explain what it feels like. Seeing this film brought back such memories as I have tried to forget and is the reason I have only seen this film the once although I do have a still shrink-wrapped copy on DVD and hope to watch it again one day.The line, this is going to be hard on my little boy as one of the crew accepts his fate is just so , how it was. No panic, no hysterics, just resignation after working to try and make things come to together. That is just how I felt when I stepped of the wreck boat and in the direction the waves were breaking. After a few metres we knew we were on the beach.Wolfgang Petterson does a great job of capturing everything that the life of a long-line fisherman is about. I can not comment on how factually accurate the story is to the real events of the real Andrea Gail but I will personally vouch for the feelings and emotions this film conveys.As for me, I was rescued form the beach along with my skipper by the coastguard and after a night in hospital being treated for exposure was back working on a different boat in less than a week.

I have not read the book. All I can say is the story is, in itself, a tragedy and it is difficult to watch knowing what the ultimate outcome will be. I can't say I enjoyed this, it was a pretty rough movie to sit through. What I will say, is that the movie captured the sadness of the story and showed us something of what it's like to be in a situation like that and for that I'm giving it a 7. I'm nobody to judge how accurate the dialog was. I will say I do not know how this movie could have been made without SOME dialog.The performers all did a good job and I am mixed on the special effects. Sometimes I thought they looked very real, sometimes they looked like-well-just special effects. One thing that surprises me is how much the critics liked this, I truly did NOT expect the many critics' reviews to be so positive but even though, I cannot say I enjoyed this, I have to give kudos for the above mentioned things. It's a terribly tragic story and though the movie wasn't perfect it did a few things well. For anyone who may not have seen it-it's very tough to watch and knowing the ultimate outcome just makes it that much tougher. This movie isn't going to win any awards but it did some things well and rates about a 6.5 to low 7. Just know what your going to watch before you watch it.

The contrast between the storm scenes and the scenes of the crew at home highlighted the two separate lives of the swordfishermen. I would certainly recommend this film to anyone but I also wanted to answer some of the comments above. First of all, if you want some of the answers to your questions try reading the book. The reason that Sebastian Junger (the author) could make assumptions on what happened to the crew of the Andrea Gail is because he interviewed other fishermen who had been in the same storm and similar, and in fact the liklihood over what could have happened to the boat is extremely well researched. Many of the events, while they did not happen to that crew on that trip, did happen to other fishermen (such as getting a hook in the hand and being pulled in the water with the lines, or being bitten by sharks inadvertently hauled on deck). The overall impression given in the book and the film is the everpresent danger in the fishermen's lives and I don't think this should be lightly dismissed as boring, or in other words used in previous reviews that show a marked disrespect for these men. One comment I have to specifically make which did make me laugh - someone pointed out that when the ship went down it would have been dark - true, but it wouldn't have been very good for filming would it?

The only thing I wish they had done was left in the last words ever heard from Capt Billy Tyne She coming on, boys and she coming on strong which was used in the Photo video of the theme but not in the movie.SPOILERS WARNINGSpecical effects They were excellent and brought the movie and story more alive for me. I was holding on to the seat of my chair for the last hour or so. VERY GOOD!!Characters Well protayed in this movie from they had to work with. The Coast Guard and the sailing ship side characters were well developed and I felt for them. The Andrea Gail crew was well protrayed for what they had to work with, Junger went in there carefully asking questions and was eventually well respected in the area but he wasn't going to bother the family's of the crew if they didn't want it. I still felt for the crew as they went thought the strom. This left about half of the crew of the Andrea Gail without a whole lot of background in the novel or the movie so I think the actors played their parts well. They all spend time with the familys to try to get as much as they could before shooting. The others characters that were still alive were also very well protrayed.Time line Was a little off and changed since most of the story was about the Andrea Gail which they think sank something between Oct 27 6pm, the last radio contact they had with the Andrea Gail, and Oct 28 around mindnight. This they think happened before the Coast Guard or the sailing ship got in trouble, the novel has the Andrea Gail sinking in about the middle of the novel and moves on to the Coast Guard. But using some of the events that had known to happen on earlier trips on the Andrea Gail gave some inside of what can happen while on these trips. While the events after the strom hit gave some idea what may have happened after losing their radio before they sank.I thought this was a very good movie althou it would have been nice to see more on the Andrea Gail and Hannah Boden side of the story.

The story of The Perfect storm was incredibly standard, like it always is in the movies of this type. I knew this film had something special to offer in the computer animated effects department so I was only looking forward for the actual storm.

Otherwise, you'll find there's hardly a hackneyed plot device, formula character or cliché that this picture misses. Even the CGI, like the script, was third-rate. I know, this was based on actual events, and people tragically died, but leave it to Hollywood to reduce it all to a hollow exercise wherein the plot seems as computer-generated as the waves. I'm really not a snob, and I've enjoyed many a trashy mega-production - even TITANIC was fun - but it must at least be something the director didn't sleep-walk through, which - since it's Wolfgang Peterson here - is the only explanation I can think of.

Petersen has also made Blockbuster films like Air Force One, Outbreak, Enemy Mine.The perfect storm, based on the book by Sebastian Unger,is the true story of a group of fisherman who ,during October 1991, died in the middle of the worst storm in the century, sacrificing their lives because they were simply doing their jobs to feed their families.The movie is one of my top 50 films of all time next The Last Picture Show (which I reviewed) in that all the characters are real, the movie's heartpounding excitement and suspense is above anything I have ever seen, and above all the movie has an aura about that makes it special due to the heart of all the characters.The crew is made up of Billy Tyne, the captain of the Andrea Gail, Bobby Shatford ,the most popular and loved fisherman in Gloucester, Micheal Buggsy Maron, Dale Murphy,David Sully Sullivan.They knew everyone in town and everyone in town loved every one of them, especially Bobby Shatford, as the documentaries on the dvd, which has reactions from the townspeople , reveal.To take care of their families, the fisherman go to the Great banks to catch fish but they don't realize , Hurrice Grace, a raging storm is combing with 2 other storms that will completely destroy everything in it's path.What I liked about the movie is it's many message. One message is that whether it's a giant corporation or a small fishing company, there will always be a greedy jerk who will put profit above human lives.Billy Tyne's boss, Bob Brown (played by Michael Ironside), the owner of the boats they use to fish for him, is the biggest jerk you've ever seen. He doesn't care one bit about his workers or they blood and sweat they put in their jobs.Here the message is whether it's a small fishing company or a big corporation, greedy individuals like Bob Brown will always exploit his workers.Then one of the characters you'll grow to love is Christine Cotter, Bobby's girlfriend, played by the beautiful Diane Lane, who calls the fisherman who went during this storm Heroes.Cotter doesn't necessarily want Bobby going out to sea, she has a bad feeling about the whole thing, but Bobby just can't let it go, because it's a big job, and above all Bobby loves to fish.Which is another message about the movie, how these men love going out to the sea and fishing. It's a love /hate relationship.They hate the pay they get from it, but they love the adventure of going out and doing it.The crew also has a love/hate relationship with their Captain Billy Tyne played by George Clooney who very well might have jeopardized the crew lives during this storm.See Tyne, gets a message about the storm, but instead of thinking about the safety of his crew, he kind of forces them to finish the job at all costs.All the characters have a story to them, and each characters have alot of heart.The visual effects for the movie is unprecedented, it is a very large scale production that hasn't really been done before on this magnitude.The movie was a box office hit, and received critical acclaim for all those involved inclding Clooney and Walhberg, who was sick during the filming of the movie.You also have award winning special effects by Stan Winston and ILM , the same crew who did the effects for Terminator 2, Jurassic Park and many other top movies.The perfect storm is filled with many bonuses that make it a perfect buy and a perfect movie3 Documentaries one by HBO called Creating the Storm which has interviews with Bobby Shatford's family,including Rick Shatford, the real Linda GreenLaw ,the Sword Captain of the Hannah Bohden. and former Captains of the Andrea Gail, and interviews with local fisherman who know all about the characters involved.Then there is another documentary called Witnessing the Storm which has actual photos from the storm in 1991, including interviews with former captains of the Andrea Gail.Then you have commentaries for the film itself including commentary by the author Sebastian Unger who recalls how afraid he was in how his book would be received,and then how good he felt when the families of the fisherman told him how good a job he did with it.As he puts it, That was important than the books sales, the movie or anything else.Combine the visual effects, with a great story, a good cast, a legendary German director, and lots of heart and you have one of the best pictures of the year.I'd put this movie at least at #12 for the top pictures of all time, for it's tremendous heart in the characters.

Gladiator suffered greatly with this problem, and &#145;A Perfect Storm' also falls too far over the edge.It's typical in this situation to look straight at the script.  Adapted from a good non-fiction book, the screenwriters had a difficult task I conjuring up a set of characters that are true to the real life heroes.  Unfortunately, instead of pulling a white rabbit out of the had, a pigeon has rammed its feet through the bottom and flown to the back of the room.  The dialogue is workman-like &#150; at times laughable.  Clooney's character tells us that he goes fishing because &#145;Its what I do!'  as though the rubber boots and the boat aren't proof enough.  We are in Irwin Allen territory so leave plausibility on the dockside.At a time when it's difficult to think of a film which does not have special effects and in particular computer generated effects, its no longer enough to rely upon them, especially, as is the case here, the technology is simply not up to the job.  We should not be looking at those huge waves and thinking how well rendered they are.  It shouldn't be an issue.But what of the performances and direction?  Most of the actors carry themselves well in the stereotypes and standards they are thrown into.  Mastrantonio in particular does well with the material, bringing a complexity not found on the page.

Unless ..... you're a crewman on the Andrea Gail ..... or on the chopper come to rescue them.Before writing this review, I read a limited number (about 20) of the IMDb User Comments on this movie (there may be over 600 by now). To my astonishment, most of the User Comments on this movie are quite negative. Some were extremely negative. Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the movie 2½ stars, which I think is just about right-on. Unlike the title of the movie, the movie itself is not perfect. The movie's main attraction, of course, is its scenes of storm-tossed seas and the effect of same upon those caught thereon. Even I have to admit that watching people getting tossed into the drink and countless shots of the Andrea Gail getting battered and bashed got to be a bit much after awhile. Still, director Wolfgang Petersen gets kudoes for the realism he brought to the many scenes of stormy seas.But most Users/Complainers cite lack of character development as perhaps the movie's biggest failing. Frankly, I don't get it. If you want to say BAD character development, that might be one thing. But LACK of character development?! I don't think so. This movie has PLENTY of character development of the movie's main characters, especially for this kind of movie, when almost everything and everyone take a back seat to the special effects. Do you know what I think? Methinks the MALE Users who are throwing brickbats at this movie are simply green-eyed of the two stars, George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, both of whom are VERY popular with the women of America.If one can put out of one's mind that this is a true story and what that implies, The Perfect Storm is a reasonably entertaining way to pass a couple of hours. And if you don't know the ending in advance -- and I didn't -- that makes for an even more compelling reason to watch it. As far as I'm concerned, the ending gave the movie its reason for being.

So, why the 6/10 rating? Well, I'll tell you. Obviously the film has gone wrong somewhere, and in its character development is where. Families of the victims of this natural disaster are actually trying to sue the Film Company that made The Perfect Storm. I can see why. The movie's characters are actually underdeveloped and while they're out on the ship they don't seem extremely likeable and to tell you the truth, they look a bit unprofessional out on the boat. I don't know if this is due to bad acting or bad writing, but it seems that way and it has effected relatives of the natural disaster to go very far so obviously The Perfect Storm is definitely not a perfect puppy. The film can also be a bit cheesy and it takes too long to get to the damn storm. Lets see some special effects, already! However, when the characters really get into the storm the audience gets just as terrified as the people must have been on the Andrea Gail. The CGI special effects are the most convincing of 2000 and I was amazed at how realistic the storm was. And you can't write a review of The Perfect Storm without mentioning that awesome huge wave that we all saw in the trailer. Awesome stuff! Add to that great sound, some strong music and a terrifying time in the ocean and you have what could've been a modern great if the characters were better developed and the corn was just cut down a little.

The story is based around the Andrea Gail, a fishing boat and her crew of seven.   Though certain parts are well developed, there is something empty about the film.  Some parts of the film are under developed, such as the yacht caught in the same storm, and the injuries that the fisherman get during the hurricanes, they are tossed around the boat like rag dolls, and yet sustain no injuries - HOW?  Two of the fishermen get quite serious injuries, and yet five minutes later they are working again as if nothing happened, how realistic is this?  Not very. The acting is poor, and the only totally convincing character is the weathered old seaman, with the beard, tatty clothes, and an old sailing hat, who is always sitting at the bar reminiscing about the 'good old days'. But then there is one of these in every film, story etc, about the sea. The two main fishermen, Wahlberg and Clooney, look like Hollywood stars trying to be skilled fisherman and act all macho, but they fail miserably - their clothes are too pressed and clean to belong to men that has been at sea for about three weeks. Some of the other actors are more convincing, but not much more, but their clothes are more realistic. The only thing that Wolfgang Peterson gets totally right is the storm.  As the title says, this storm is perfect, but for two reasons.  Reason one, i n real life it was the worst ever recorded storm, and it could not have got any worse.  And reason two, in the film; it is the only thing that Peterson makes actually amazing, the waves, the thunder the lightening, I felt like was in the storm - then there was the acting - what has happened?The film starts with poor acting, the storm commences - now I think that it is going to get interesting, and then the acting is back, oh dear the films back to its no very good storyline. Like in most films about mother nature, there is always a few scenes set in a weather station, with bad actors saying that this storm cannot possibly get any worse, then, yep you have guessed it, it does!  Well, in The Perfect Storm, the actors are exceptionally bad, and there is a man saying 'this can't possibly get any worse', and his secretary is looking like we are all feeling - bored and, like most of us, she does not really care. There is water, water everywhere, but not a plot insight. Wolfgang Peterson has only done one thing correctly.   He hits the spot with the hundred foot waves, it's the shame the actors, and actresses, do not do the same.

The poor women wanting their husbands to give up this life.  The I can't believe you're going out again instead of staying with me.

Okay, so it's a really bad storm with some occasionally good effects, but the boat-meets-storm plot has been done a thousand times, generally much better.  Nothing about the presentation made this storm of the century seem any worst than any other bad movie storm.The entire first 30 minutes of the movie could have been cut with no effect on the film at all.  It serves to develop personal relationships with the loved ones back home who you promptly forget (other than Clooney's gal).  They do nothing for the rest of the film other than watch TV of the storm.  Why did we care about the boat owner at all?Then, there's the fishing subplot.  Okay, maybe we use that as an excuse to go into the storm, but it was pretty weak.  Then there are the myriad of flaws in the character actions and nautical activities.  Nobody seemed to want to rig the ship for the storm.  When we get a calm, nobody tries to take advantage of it to batten down.  People don't always wear lifelines.  Lifelines break.

This comes twofold in the atmosphere of the film, character, script e.t.c., and also in the technical aspects of the story and events, admittedly I am not an expert on the subject but things 'seem' too extreme and impossible and are often in direct contradiction to facts I do know from having watched documentaries on various related subjects e.g. survival in stormy sea circumstances.  But I will discuss the latter bit later.I feel a major problem in many films is the fake 'professionalism' that comes through the script and the acting(especially American, although I get the impressions they often try to look more intense than British people in everything they do).  What I mean by this is that everyone is always focused entirely on their job at hand and every communication made is formal and direct and militant.  This is unnatural and to a large extent unprofessional. In our everyday jobs generally the better we get the less we need direct communication, especially in some of the monotonous tasks we saw being performed here.  I doubt sailors are constantly throwing each other orders and telling each other unnecessary things, like 'shift that fish' when they are offloading fish, pretty bloody obvious especially when you do it every day huh. Because the film is trying to build up to a big event, it is constantly over-emphasizing every little thing that people do and we don't have a sense that these fishermen have been at the job for very long, in a community that has always revolved around fishing, a boat coming in would be unlikely to receive a greeting reminiscent of a POW whose family have once again met after years of torture, but these sailors do.  Don't get me wrong, there is danger involved but it is more everyday to the fishermen. The worst thing in the entire film however is the bloody music, ever present and trying to turn every conversation into a moving dramatic speech. Some film people need to learn that fact-based human drama and epic sweeping story's DO NOT MIX.In terms of the accuracy that I mentioned earlier, to say this is supposedly the worst storm last century it takes a lot to kill anyone.  people in the water still capable of swimming despite currents that can topple huge 100ft boats, amazing recoveries from hooks through the hands. **SPOILER** One thing that did confuse me, although I would expect the researchers and advisors to be accurate on this was the rescue men jumping in the water and then getting in the cage that was lowered down, it seemed dumb enough to jump down in the first place because people can not swim effectively in water like that, surely.The special effects were good although Mr Petersons huge praise about the advances in ability seems excessive, especially since it can't be hard to make the CGI and real water blend together when its dark, mostly one colour and moves and changes form so rapidly. One rather laughable part, other than the script, is the attempt to make the actors seem more ruff' and ready by simply having a bit of scraggy hair on the blokes chins, I'm sorry but Mark Wahlberg and co. (minus perhaps Clooney) had lovely soft skin and it showed, even rookie laborers like Wahlberg's character are tough because they grow up in these environments.Altogether not a terrible film, but not good either.  Ignoring the court cases surrounding it this film doesn't do the many fishermen around the world any favours.

Based on a true story, The Perfect Storm follows the Andrea Gail, a fishing boat that left Gloucester, Massachusetts and headed directly into the eye of a hurricane of unprecedented proportions.Realizing his fishermen were underpaid and overworked, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) decides to make the last fishing expedition of the season and aim for more distant and abundant waters. Although leaving their homes and their loved ones required tremendous will power, the promise of a more successful venture convinced fishermen Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly) and David Sullivan (William Fichtner) to join, and Andrea Gail optimistically departs. Soon, however, family members' unanimous discontent about the sporadic nature of the trip combines with deteriorating weather conditions. Conflicts arise when Captain Billy and his crew decide to ignore Captain Linda's (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) radio warnings about the perfect storm brewing close ahead.The Perfect Storm slowly builds up to Andrea Gail's departure, and initially focuses on each fisherman's personal situation. Although these depictions offer enough information about the characters' needs and their devotion to the sea, they are not sufficient to create in the viewer a sense of sympathy for each character. Consequently, these scenes do not provide a setup that is affective and they fail to offer an intriguing premise as the basis for the drama that will eventually unfold. As if to compensate, the swelling music that accompanies these scenes tries to provide a feeling that something is leading up to a great event.When Andrea Gail is at sea and it is clear that the main event will be her struggle with the ocean's temperament, The Perfect Storm's plot oscillates between escalating complications (mainly accidents or animosity among the fishermen) and the downslides of their respective little victories, as the complications are safely resolved. While these choices seem to create a tantalizing suspense, they mainly throw the viewer's expectations off balance and they interrupt the flow of the plot's main undercurrent the perfect storm. Furthermore, the climactic event evolves while other smaller dramas, such as a coast guard helicopter trying to rescue a family, or the helicopter running out of fuel, unfold simultaneously. This distracts from the main focus and suggests that the main plot needs simultaneous drama. With the help of patchy photography and ridiculously cartoony special effects, The Perfect Storm is unsuccessful in its attempt to define the ocean as being truly magnificent --or rather, perfect-- when it is most dangerous.

Wolfgang Petersen has directed many far superior thrillers (even the slightly overwrought Outbreak is far better than this), and far more satisfying ones as well. The scenes involving the actual storm are exciting and often terrifying, but anything else in the film seems like useless padding and just an excuse to make the film long enough to satisfying your paying dollar. The very talented Diane Lane gives an embarrassing performance as the noble blue-collar woman waiting for her man (Mark Wahlberg) on shore. When she screams at the evil guy who was paying for the fish that the boys were out trying to get, you really wonder why the hell she bothered to accept such a badly written role.

But with Petersen at the helm, it's clearly worth watching. The Perfect Storm is a film that reminds us that movies are for entertainment.  A simple story of American fisherman is brought to life with very good special effects, and that's all the movie is supposed to be. This isn't the type of movie that requires 10 viewings to grasp the depth and symbolism, just an appreciation for simple cinema.

But being based on a true story adds nothing to the quality of any film by itself; it's an interesting tidbit but is quite irrelevant to how good a movie is. In the case of The Perfect Storm it might have even been a detractor. It stifles the plot which becomes predictable (I would even say boring) with several plot lines underdeveloped and leading nowhere.I'm sure everybody knows the plot by now so I don't think I'll spoil it but the whole plot can be summarized very simply as follows there were some fishermen who got caught in a huge storm and died. that's it. if you think about it nothing else needs to be added to cover anything that happens. In my opinion there needs to be more than that to make a story interesting and engaging.The acting is actually quite good by just about everybody. George Coolney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, John C. Reiley, William Fichtner and others all deliver solid performances. But it sadly feels like a waste of effort in a movie that lacks a message and ends up being just depressing. 5 out of 10.

This was by far the worst thing in the film. Sure the sound of the storm's waves were necessary while watching the action scenes, but I was ready to press the mute button because the score was SO BAD. Not JUST bad...ROTTEN. I wonder if James Horner actually read the script. Every note made every scene sound the same, like it was the end of the movie.THE DIRECTION. There is a lot to this that Wolfgang Peterson had to think about, so I can't go into everything he could've done, but hmmm...let's see...)1) Could've eliminated that overlong beginning with the contrived character development. 2) Didn't have to cut back and forth so much, but keep at least a few solid shots on the crew throughout the film. Sometimes suspense is better the less shots you use. There are probably more things wrong w/direction, but I'd have to see the film again, and I won't!THE SCRIPT. Oi. What the hell is up with everything?! The sharkbite, the hokey everybody on board is a good guy thing where all the little character conflicts HAVE to be resolved before fate inevitably takes over so that these guys are all remembered. I mean, I thought these guys being remembered for their bravery in their willingness to risk their lives for a little money was good enough. But apparently the script didn't think that was honorable enough, so they put a bunch of things, like the kind of-villain(?) of the film saves the guy who punched him, just to show that these guys all even out and they're all good guys. Also, the relationship between Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney. George calls Mark a little punk and treats him that way throughout the film, so I guess it's supposed to be a pivotal moment when he tells Mark to take the wheel when the hurricane's coming. Then the obligatory pause from Mark, then I SAID TAKE IT! (Sigh.)Also, there could've been at least some level of realism, at least during the entire Coast Guard rescue attempt. Alas, this was not to be. Clooney being thrown up and down at lightning speeds on the ship's mast(What was he holding onto?), the Coast Guard ready to crash a half-million dollar helicoptor just like that. How did they not die if they were stuck for that long just floating in a hurricane?The dialogue was borderline laughable. I'm a biased fan of George Clooney, and also a bit of a Mark Wahlberg fan) so I probably would've watched this anyway, but it would've been more exciting to listen to his voice and watch George Clooney's stubble grow than him battle waves while it seems Hurricane Gail is just water is being thrown from a bucket into the ship.Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio acted kind of funky throughout the film, but I was fine with it 'cause I'm guessing a lady all alone on the sea for a while could be kind of weird.Possibly one good thing the film did was definitely show how trivial the typical white-collar desk office job is. These guys literally risk everything so they could receive..I don't know. what...a few thousand dollars *TOPS* for catching 6 THOUSAND pounds of rotting fish? Well we're not sure about the 6 thousand or the rotting part, but the whole American bravery  technique used in the script is perhaps what Amricans need to sell in Hollywood to keep kids interested in honorable lives and to not be lazy.

The Captain (Geo Clooney) is a bitter skipper whose biggest problem is that he's a has-been swordfisherman.  I suppose that's a big problem if fishing is the cash crop of your town.  He's pretty sensitive about it, too.  Don't mention past failures to this guy unless you want to see him cuss and overact sinfully. He might also be bitter because there is a homely woman swordfisher captain who skippers another boat, and who is not only in love with him, but who overacts her way to far bigger sets of swordfish than Captain Clooney ever managed.  She also pays attention to weather alerts.  That's why she lived.The other main characters are a mama's-boy dude whose wife beats him up, but he loves her anyway; a big guy that kind of reminds me of Chewbacca, but he has a soft heart because he doesn't see his kid very often (wife has custody); a mousy Reverend-Jim-type character who runs the ice machine on the ship (very poorly, I might add) and who has no friends and no woman, so he tries to go home with a Large-Marge-type character from the local tavern (poor fella was born with beer goggles on, I guess); a hippified dude that played the blind guy in Contact and who is a mortal enemy of Chewbacca (hippie dude is a total landlubber, but he's in charge of the Halloween lightsticks-- cool job); finally, a Black dude with some weird accent that is not African, Carribean, or Cuban.  He's the coolest guy in the show, but alas, he's one of the first to drown.There's also some really cheesy parts for some known names in Hollywood (e.g., Karen Allen).  On the whole, the casting alone should have made this movie decent, but the scripting, character development, and lack of a plot besides all the fisher dudes die made this movie very hard to watch without thinking it would be improved if featured on the Mystery Science Theater 3000.  The battered husband gets to do a little Luke Skywalker action before he drowns, calling to his abusive wife with his thoughts from somewhere in the Atlantic.  Since his wife gave him a shiner, I guess he got to live a little longer than everyone else.The weatherman (Shooter McGavin from Happy Gilmore) was just too much. He either didn't have a life or was WAY too into weather (prolly both).And, in case you're wondering, all the swordfishermen die-- which, to me, is nothing but natural justice for the way they treated the swordfish.The bottom line is that this should have been some cheesy made-for-TV movie with lots of commercials, because the acting was that bad (overacting in most cases).  The special effects were artificial and obviously computerized.  The editing was screwy.  But, I guess if you sprinkle the F-word over a TV movie, you have to show it in the theater because it needs a rating.If you must rent it, wait until it becomes a 99-cent rental at Blockbuster (or your local movie rental store).

In 1981, the area was devastated by the loss with all hands of the local lifeboat during a colossal storm. The events portrayed in 'The Perfect Storm' should have had a great deal of resonance - unfortunately, they didn't. The movie shows Hollywoood at its best - and worst.What was good? There is no denying that the special effects steal the movie. Not only do they take computer technology to new levels, but they actually make the story possible. There is simply no way to fault the use of effects to depict an almost inconceivable event. As a showcase for the powers of ILM it can't be faulted.Secondly, the cast were well chosen for the roles. Even George Clooney sets his smirk aside and gets down to acting.But the rest is all wrong...Firstly, the script. In short, it is appalling, more deserving of a made for TV movie on a small budget than a big feature. Some of the lines are so bad that you have to laugh - even when a struggle for life and death is being depicted on screen.Secondly, the structure of the movie. It takes almost an hour to get going, far too much time is spent on the set-up or 'exploring' the characters. Unfortunately, with such a weak script, the characters can come across as cardboard cutouts taken from central casting and its hard to care about them.Thirdly, the sound. Storms are loud - granted, but the filmmakers had paid a lot of money for James Horner's score. So they pumped up the volume of the music. Then they realised that Horner's music (which has to be one of his worst scores by the way) was swamping the sound effects - so the effects were cranked up... somewhere under there is the dialogue. If you're watching this through a good home cinema system you might be able to get the voice track - in a cinema - no chance.Fourthly, the makers seemed to lack confidence in their subject. All of the events of ANDREA GAIL must be assumed to have happened - there is no evidence. So we have a crew rivalry, a shark attack, not one but two men overboard and a proposterous sequence where George Clooney tries to cut some equipment free. None of this is known to have happened, but tit had to go in to make the movie come across like a theme park ride.Finally, the ending. The movie should have ended about five minutes before it actually does. The awesome image used on the poster is taken from the scene that should have ended the film. Instead we get some of the cheesiest dialogue in the film as ANDREA GAIL sinks below the waves. The film looses its impact and descends into emotional syrup.Obviously the people at the studio didn't have enough guts to got out with a bang, perhaps they felt it would play badly in the MidWest - who knows, but perhaps a director's cut will come along one day with a less anodyne ending.In short, a missed opportunity. The people who work on the seas, those who are involved in search and rescue and their loved ones who wait back on shore deserve a better film.

People wouldn't talk about the film, because doing so would spoil the film for others.What was the intention of the screen play writer? Was it to bring glory to the lives of the merchant fishermen? The film left me with a sunken feeling. (No pun intented). I didn't enjoy the films conclusion. Movies like this had their place in the depressing, realistic 1970's. I hope this isn't a trend in the 2000's.

Here he attempts to provide the same awe for something omnipotent (nature) as he did in the last film (the Presidency of the United States) but all he's able to provide is gross sentimentality amidst uneven special effects. Ostensibly the true story of a doomed commercial swordfishing expedition, Bill Wittliff's astonishingly corny screenplay seeks to provide fictionalized moral uplift while delivering the assumed dramatic goods. Because the inherent tragedy by itself probably wouldn't sit well with today's audience, Wittliff counterpoints the main drama with two other tales of survival designed to mollify and appease but there's so little character development that it comes off confusing and uninvolving. There's a lot made of the grand lure of the sea by the New Englanders who love and depend on it but the main characters themselves are driven purely by motives of profit and competition, something Wittliff never bothers to explore. The acting, led by George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane, has no presence whatsoever. The score by James Horner is terrible, serving as a unrelenting, overbearing supplement to the action. Petersen has fallen a long way since In The Line Of Fire; at least there John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood offset his jingoism.

Here are my comments, starting with some personal observations1) Did anyone else want to reach through the screen into the sound mixer's control room and TURN OFF THE DAMN MUSIC? Not only did it never stop for one minute, but half the time it was totally inappropriate to the onscreen action (ie stuck in heroic/uplifting epic mode while we're watching people dying). Did James Horner even watch the footage while he was composing or did he just write two hours of nonstop music and set the tape on auto?2) You know a movie is in trouble when, 15-20 min into it, you correctly guess the next thing a character says (Mark Wahlberg I've *gotta* go.)3) The Karen Allen/obstinate skipper/Coast Guard subplot. Was that flown in from another (unfinished?) movie? Maybe it was intended to provide some breadth of scope to this killer storm. Maybe it was just to pad out the length of the movie to put it into epic territory. Peterson didn't give me any clues as to how this was relevant to the story of the Andrea Gail...4) Too damn many scenes of Marky Mark's character kissing his gal. I mean, I get the idea, already...perhaps he still hasn't quite gotten Dirk Diggler out of his system.5) Okay, I know this is a movie about fishermen, but they really go to town in the animal cruelty department. Swordfish are eviscerated. A (presumably animatronic) shark gets its brains blown out. I don't care if the Humane Society gave their stamp of approval, you'll never open a can of Sun Kist the same way again.Overall I think Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio put in the best performance in her bit part as another swordfisher boat. Most everyone else is middling, which is about all I can expect from them given the script. You get sketchy outlines for the characters, those are as close as you get to knowing them. You have the automatic reflex (I hope, if you are a human person) of concern when one of them is in danger, but not the deep concern of someone you really care about. These folks are basically props for the effects to toss around, engulf, and throw animatronic sharks at. I feel sorry for that, because this could have been a much better movie if only for better characterization and writing.I doubt any amount of acting would be able to upstage those flashy ILM special effects, which, like most other CGI effects these days, don't even try to look really naturalistic. The digital waves and rain bowl over everything and everyone in sight. I'm no fan of this brand of larger than life effects, and like one of those poor guys caught overboard, there really isn't much I could do but let them wash over me and hope I live. If you go to movies to be thrilled by special effects, you're gonna love this, it delivers.I came out of watching The Perfect Storm feeling totally exhausted and somewhat disappointed. I remember the Wolfgang Petersen of Das Boot, the director who was able to take something similar to this--a bunch of bickering, smelly, bearded guys aboard a sea vessel in trouble--and make it deeply affecting without going overboard on extraneous crap. He is a talented fella, and he can make excellent movies if he wants to. He misstepped with this surefire blockbuster.

After what seemed like three hours, this pathetic project I'm sorry to call a movie, was over. The cast lead by the always talented George Clooney was awful. Not even George could save this flick. This storm wasn't perfect at all. In fact, it was one of the biggest throw away money films ever. Yes, the budget was very high, but for what? Millions of dollars put into a computer that created fake, unrealistic waves, and....that's about it. We're not looking for a movie that is set out to change the world here, but at least put the tons of money towards a good cause. Like I said, the cast was poorly designed. I realized that the actors didn't even have many lines. Their actions were supposedly greater than words. The script was like, what, ten lines long. Where was the intelligent writing? Or, any writing for that matter. So, thanks to today's technology, what we have here is a very long, and very boring movie filled with computer generated waves. This film steered the real life story to the ground. Which unfortunately, is where the movie focuses on.

The movie was so poorly written that even the most dramatic lines were comical and had me laughing out loud. George Clooney (who I think is a terrible actor anyway  because he always acts the same in all of his films) plays a self-centered fishing boat captain who has to prove to himself that he hasn't lost it by sailing his crew (a bunch of immature men) into the middle of three hurricanes (The Perfect Storm according to the local TV meteorologist) in order to catch a lot of fish. The fact that he doesn't realize what he's sailing into is astounding to me. And the fact the he doesn't turn around and head home because he has to make the catch of his lifetime while endangering the lives of his crew is repulsive. His only saving grace (if you can call it saving) was that he went down with the ship instead of surfacing with Mark Wahlberg (not that he would have lived anyway if he did surface.) Maybe I missed something but how could he NOT turn around. At one point they all take a vote as to whether or not they should sail on and all of the men agree that they should because if they don't the fish will spoil. This is after the scene where all of the crew wanted to head home because they had a bad feeling about the journey. Anything to make a buck , I guess. What's up with that????OK...now to the special effects. A lot of people have posted about how incredible they were. And some of them were indeed great. But my problem was I knew they were effects as there is no way to re-create that kind of environment. Knowing this, I couldn't get past the fact that the storm was entirely computer generated and for some reason that ruined the specialness of it it all. I know...call me a cynic!! The final wave that did them in was tremendous, but I found it hard to believe that the ship withstood as much as it did without sinking or capsizing  many scenes earlier. But hey, I'm not sailor. I also wondered why no one on the boat EVER wore a life jacket. I mean COME ON. I would have strapped one on immediately.

Were they lovers? Were they friends? Her tears at the end suggests the former. Also Bugsy's relationship is laughable.

This helped me to enjoy it more, but that still didn't save this film.I came out of the cinema wondering how the film had managed to fill up over two hours.  By the end, we had no real feeling for the characters, and in fact one or two scenes made this so obvious to the viewer that one was jarred out of the suspension of disbelief required when watching films.SPOILERS BELOW - PLEASE READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS FILMThe scene which brought this home the most was the funeral - one of the attendees shown was a woman whom one of the supporting characters had met only twice, and then rather briefly, yet she was presented as a mourner of equal import as the wives and mothers of the other men lost.  She brought her children with her, who looked suitably grief-stricken, yet these children had never met the man for whom they mourned.Another example of lack of character development was the female captain - her character could have been developed so much more, but she was left as a distraction.  And what of the other crew members - why did two of them constantly fall out?  It was barely explained, and some of the crew were no more than perfunctorily introduced.Similar problems concerned the sailing boat also lost in the storm - we were given no introduction whatsoever to these characters, nor to the lifeboatmen/coastguard who saved them, and who tried to reach the Adrienne Gale.Faced with such shallow characters, it was difficult if not impossible to identify them, and when they were beset by problems I found myself not caring very much.Having said that, I enjoyed the film.  The visual effects were very impressive, flawless in fact.  The pace was upped, although the events that took place were often confusing (who was it who was washed overboard at any given time?  They all looked the same in their smocks).

These scenes are fairly exciting in themselves and give a foretaste of what is to befall the main cast, plus they raise tension by creating audience hope that a rescue of Clooney and Co. is on the cards. But the price of interrupting the main storyline is to force the key scenes to do double duty in the time available to them. This might even have been possible had the script been a good one.    The script however is 'B' grade in its dialogue and woefully thin in creating characters and relationships. In fact, take out the dialogue soundtrack and put in a voice-over narration and you'd get a perfectly acceptable dramatised documentary. Come to think of it, maybe that's what the producers have in mind - spend all the 'below the line' money on the special effects and after the commercial release, sell the storm footage for a television series on The World's Worst Storms.Final note James Horner's music, sadly, is as overinflated as Diane Ladd's lines.

If you are after some mindless rip-roaring excitement and entertainment, then The Perfect Storm will be a perfect film for you. The special effects really are awesome. I used to work at sea, and even I was feeling sea-sick in places. I guess most of the ocean scenes used CGI graphics, but it was very hard to tell - and moving water must be one of the hardest things to reproduce on computers.The first half of the film is quite slow, allowing some (but not much) character development - but then the excitement really takes off. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg put in good performances as the determined (and pressured) skipper and the rookie deck-hand. The plot doesn't really allow us to learn much about their characters (and less about the rest of the crew), but Clooney and Wahlberg do their best with what they have.I do have one BIG criticism of the film though. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was TOTALLY miscast as a fishing-boat skipper. She looked ridiculous to the point of absurd. I assume that her character was invented for politically-correct purposes (though correct me if I'm wrong - I haven't read the book!). I've never heard of a female trawler-skipper and, frankly, it seems as implausible as a female submarine captain! If one existed she wouldn't be anything like Mastrantonio - who appears the sort of girl for whom a broken finger nail would be a major crisis! I bet the writers were thinking Right, we need a token strong female character in this film who isn't just standing on the shore waiting for her man to return! No doubt if Hollywood could persuade Wolfgang Petersen to remake Das Boot, they would demand a female character on the U-boat! My other criticism is that the film sometimes lurches into cliches and sentimentality. The final words of Mark Wahlberg were a good example of this and really made me cringe. There is only love ... yuk! yuk! yuk! yuk!Overall, this was a enjoyable popcorn-chewing disaster movie - I would say as good as Twister and superior to Armageddon.

Actually, as the fat chick (Irene), Rusty Schwimmer is pretty good even though she's got stupid dialogue to trod through; in the end, she's the only one I cared anything about.  But absolutely the WORST performance (and one of the most embarassing I've seen in recent years) is from Diane Lane as Wahlberg's girlfriend.  For starters, she can't manage the accent (Wahlberg, from near Boston, gets sort of close but lacks the northern Massachusetts twang).  And Lane gives it her TV-acting all yelling her emotions to prove how strongly she feels, TRYING to convey a tough-gal swagger while drinking in the local bar.  Embarassing.

Just to season it with a little love, a little future perspectives to get washed away, some on-board rivalry and some old man and the sea - cliché simply didn't do it for me. 2 out of 10 (and those points only for the 10,000 fishermen of Gloucester, who lost their lives since 1623 at sea) "}{"Title":"Human Aspiration In Conflict With The Elements of Nature","Date":"25 July 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  This film presents an object lesson in the conflict between human hubris (i.e., overweening pride) and the implacable, impersonal forces of nature. As such, the plot manages to evoke both pity and fear, -- the two essential emotions of the classical definition of tragedy, followed by Shakespeare and others, but first analyzed by Aristotle in his tract, The Poetics.  In the film, the impersonal forces of nature develop inexorably -- just as the decision-making processes of the protagonists are progressively bounded by their self-imposed will to achieve their goal, until they realize the full dimensions of their predicament. In classical Greek analysis, this was deemed the moment of self-insight, the anagnoresis. Only then do they face the reality and consequences of their choices and the limitations of the human condition.  The film thus inspires Pity for the sailors and Fear for their fate, but the audience experiences catharsis of these terrifying feelings while sitting the their warm, dry seats. The acting is ensemble-style, despite the presence of Clooney, who is trapped by the same forces as the other crew members. The film is somewhat marred by a maudlin, seemingly tacked-on ending that adds nothing to our understanding or empathy with the crew; it also adds virtually nothing to plot development -- the soul of any screenplay, especially in the would-be tragedy genre. Nothing in the film attains the grandeur of the driven captain who risks all for confirmation of his shaken self-confidence (I always bring home the fish...). There one can find some parallels with the fiction stories of Moby Dick and The Old Man and the Sea. So here we have nature imitating art(!) Near the end of the action at sea the crewmates find solace in the irrefutable truth that they have fought the good fight, come what may (as Clooney virtually remarks to another crewmate) -- which is what this film is really all about.

How absolutely stupid is this? I mean, it was like We´re gonna die because we choose to brave the storm, but we made the right decision anyway. Laughable.The story was nonexistent. Sorry about the fishermen who died in 1991, but this movie was really, really horrible. I don´t wanna hear about this based on a true story - sorry, but the only real things about the original tragedy were the names of the fishermen and the boat. I mean, who knows what happened after the contact to the Andrea Gail broke? Nobody, so all after this scene is pure speculation. In my opinion, the whole true story was just a marketing ploy. The movie could have been MUCH MUCH better if they had taken the Twister route - take a CGI-storm and make up some story. Some good story. I didn´t care about the characters one bit, because I knew they were gonna drown. So, for example, I would have preferred it if the shark had eaten (or at least bitten the leg off) Marky Mark. I mean, when the were doing CPI on the sailor who had gone overboard, I said aloud What´s the use? Why are they doing this?. A friend said That´s to get the water out of the lungs. I answered I know THAT, but I mean, why don´t they let him drown? They all die in the end, anyway.. That´s the whole problem - who cares about the characters fight for survival if you know they´re doomed?

With Wolfgang Petersen directing, a humongous 120 million dollar budget, a well stuffed quiver of stars - how could it possibly miss ?It did, though not by much.... While the plot is simple (not in itself a fault ) and everybody knows the eventual outcome, the film still manages to get off the ground and take the audience along well enough. Both the introduction of the crew, their background and motivations, as well as the pressures of home, job and aspirations are done smoothly, expertly and not overly tearful. Kudos to Mr. Petersen for that !When the 'Andrea Gail' finally leaves the harbour for her fateful voyage, one -does- understand why the fishermen sail forth for 'one final haul' - and one knows for certain that they understand the dangers involved, and go nevertheless. Overall, the film never fails on this count, neither does it on athmosphere or depicting the gritty, all-male, environment of the swordboat. The build up of tension which follows is expertly done until the sinking, although the yachting trip (which is a secondary subplot) is quite clichee and stereotypical - but prepares the far more interesting story of the rescue helicopter' struggle and plight. So far so good.The big letdowns are the storm itself - despite million of dollars in CGIs and  superior sound hardware in the cinema, it never feels real, present or solid. Having sailed in some pretty rough weather myself might have contributed, but overall the atlantic storm, waves and spray in Petersen's own 'Das Boot' of 1980(!) are far more intense, real and convincing then the'Perfect Storm' of 2000. Especially during the daylight scenes one just felt that this wasn't 'real', but just some fancy, expensive animation. There never - except for those scenes actually shot on the shore in Maine - is any perceptible presence of the wind, its sheer orcanic force and gusts or the might and dread of an onrushing wave. Petersen seems to have realized this shortcoming - there are a vast number of close-up shots of Clooney and Wahlberg to compensate for it, and the actors labour to convey the tension, respect and later, dread they feel, but there are only a few shots of the tossing sea around the 'Andrea Gail' in all its supposedly terrible fury. So the audience gets the strange impression, that while the  Coast Guard ship and the rescue helicopter seem to be in dire straits, the 'Andrea Gail' seems to encounter only minor 'difficulty' in weathering the storm - besides some inevitable action-themed complications.I personally have never in my entire life seen (or thought possible) as many men swept overboard a steaming, pitching, rocking boat by waves/whatever, without lifevests, dry suits or other equipment, in full encumbering gear, boots and sweaters and still be rescued, especially smack in the middle of 'the storm of the century'!As for that final monstrous, ship devouring wave - well, who is to judge upon its appearance ? Nevertheless, to me, it looked like it sneaked out of 'Deep Impact' for a quick cameo appearance..... As for critics claiming they got 'seasick' watching its 'realism', I guess it must have been the Nachos with that double side-order of cheese!Still, overall its a pretty wild ride, and solid entertainment is delivered. What really ruins part of the 'Storm' for me are the two 'Titanic'scripted scenes with Mr. Wahlberg, which I couldn't care less for, and the overly tearful, sentimentalist  and weepy epilogue, which is truly nerve-grating.At least half the audience (and not only the male part, mind you) started to groan in agony when one lengthy eulogy for the crew after another got delivered - not to slighten Mrs. Mastrantonio's talent, but it gets sadly wasted this way.On a general note, the soundtrack does get slightly monotonous after a while, while the cast performs uniformly well. What faults there are with the movie aren't theirs, but the scripts and CGIs, and IMHO, and much of the likely success/appeal of the film lies with George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. Without them, it would sink even faster than the 'Gail' - with them it stands a fair chance of steaming home. As I said - it misses, though not by as much as others this summer. 6.5 out of 10 fishermen for me.

DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE ENDING SPOILED.","Date":"20 July 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  Two things occurred to me right away after viewing the first twenty minutes or so of The Perfect Storm, which is chocked full of inane dialogue and cliches too numerous to mention.  ONE, was that I'd been duped by yet another Hollywood Summer Blockbuster campaign.  TWO, was that director Wolfgang Petersen (and I'm assuming that English is not his first language) has absolutely no ear for what sounds stupid and what doesn't.  This film is indeed strange in its ineptitude considering that Petersen has made several good and one quite excellent film.  However, dialogue does not a movie make. As they say, It's the story, Stupid.  More to the point, it's not quite the tale (a very intriguing and true one) that makes this film bad; it's the storytelling itself.  The fault lies completely in good ole' Wolfie's lap. The actors certainly achieved enough realism and warmth in their portrayals (with one glaring omission...more on that later), and Lucasfilm subsidiary and legendary FX house,ILM certainly held up their end of the deal with spectacular (but not perfect) stormy wave visuals.I am stuck then with a puzzle.  How could a major motion picture of such consequence manage to let scene after scene go by without giving us much more information about the characters than we get in their introductory scenes?  We know that Diane Lane loves Wahlberg and is worried, but that's all we get.  We know that Clooney is feeling the weight of command baring down on him.  Again, that's pretty much all we get.  Not only is this what we get, it's EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPECT !!!  I sat in dismay as opportunity after opportunity was wasted.  No more info on the characters came, and boredom set in quickly.  This character deficit is made only more puzzling by the alternating subplot involving Karen Allen and a private boat being rescued that only managed to pull us away from the story, which I'd assumed was about the Andrea Gail and it's characters.We do, however, get the myriad cliches the endless close-ups of Diane Lane staring longingly out to sea with swelling strings underneath; the crusty old seaman in the bar; the waving child on the shore; Clooney's boss from Hell; the two men who hate each other (inexplicably) then end up as pals when one rescues the other; the shark attack for almost no reason at all. The whole film seemed to be done by the numbers.Which now leads me to a striking and disturbing cliche that even Hollywood has largely outgrown.  The character of Alfred Pierre, the one black fisherman with an accent (I'm assuming he's from Haiti) played by Allen Payne seems to have no opinions, almost no lines, and virtually nothing to do.  To understand the near impossibility of this is to know that the story plays out mainly on a boat with just a few guys.  All of them have storylines except Pierre.  ALL OF THEM !!!  Threadbare storylines, but storylines none-the-less.  In an early scene in the bar, he is introduced literally AS HE IS EXITING THE SCENE (to have sex with a woman), and that's that.  We assume he likes to have sex.  Then he gets on the boat with the rest of the guys and that's all we ever know about him.  Keep in mind that he's there for the entire film, being blasted with water cannons in front of a green screen along with his fellow castmates, so it seems all the more odd.  Imagine if ONE of the Brady kids just sat there week after week while EVERYONE ELSE had something to say and do.  The tragedy here is that Alfred Pierre died right with the rest of these men, and there is sadly no tribute to him what-so-ever.  Indeed Allen Payne the actor couldn't even use footage of this movie on his reel because he's practically an extra (for two hours!!!?).  AMAZING!!!To sum up, this is a film of astounding technical prowess and similarly astounding ineptitude.  It's loud.  At times, it's actually startling.  The sheer force of the visual effects keep it from being completely boring, but ultimately it's a huge, wet mess.

For once I was one of those of the world who don't manage to get sucked into the whirlwind of hype, which surrounds almost everything these days, and haven't been able to start obsessing over the details of i) the 'true life' story, ii) the 'in-depth' interviews and documentaries with surviving members of the community of characters presented, iii) the book, iv) the scientific documentary tie-in on discovery (which was much better) even before you get to xxiii) the 'making-of' documentary. Thus I had the rare chance to indulge myself and see a movie as the movie pure and simple without bringing any preconceived baggage with me.So on walking out of the theatre I pictured the scene where this movie idea was pitched to whichever boss was in his office at the time. A good, solid and DRAMATIC true-life story, with the added bonus of being a story where effects could be put to big and good use realising the backdrop of the sea, in the tradition of (as others too have noticed the connection between among others) Twister. Let's throw in a Mr. Nature type with a limp (George Clooney - somebody give him an axe and call him a lumberjack, please) and for the pubescent girl (or boy - who knows) demographic, an ex-model trying to prove himself as an actor (in semi-serious role - well one day Mark, you might become Guy Pierce, just keep trying!) and let the fx compensate for the rest of the shallow stereotyping and weak characterisation, which we, for some reason, have become immune to and quite willingly accept thesedays.Not that I've ever known anything be able to compensate for anything - that is just movie-speak for this bit is good, we know the other bit isn't, but we hope it is so spectacular and expensive that it will blind you to the fact that the rest of our sub-standard work is fundamentally flawed.For that extra wring of genius to be squeezed out of an experienced and tested, old genre-master and create the masterpiece the whole media has been crying out for, in the two weeks since 'mission impossible  2' was condemned as a confusing disappointment (although spectacular) by the critical concensus, the storyboys decided to make it a challenge to Hitchcock's complete oeuvre and let it wallow in an ocean of suspense. Until you read any of their propaganda.So not knowing that every of these unloveable, one-sided (hesitates when he comes to use the word) characters dies at the end is a large red herring. Just a herring so large and so red that you have to consider it and be distracted by it, until you forget that the actors parts have to resolve their situation and you discover who and how they die is more important than watching the scene when they do. Maybe that is why the fact of their tragedy figures so prominently in the regurgitated news we hear all the time. 'A Fitting Tribute to the Memory of the Men...' who religeously sacrificed their lives in order to defend and further the ideals of the American Dream, even if they were up against the forces of an indefatigable nature.Nevertheless this vehicle will satisfy many in their search for two-and-a-half hours entertainment on a Friday night because that is what they will call two-and-a-half hours worth of Friday-night entertainment.Unfortunatly, once again the promise of a rounded and satisfying story told in pictures could not be fulfilled in this unedifying tale of the fate of a fisherman and his crew caught up in the hurricane of the century The Perfect Storm.

Filmed in a giant water tank, enhanced by digital effects, some of the set pieces are jaw-clenchingly awesome. Unfortunately, the backstory of this drama - rooted as it is  in real life - is reproduced on screen as Hollywood cliche.Mark Wahlberg has a wonderful, relaxed presence in some of his early scenes as rookie fisherman Bobby, but even his enthusiasm can't make the lame dialogue convincing. Besides George Clooney as the stoic Captain Tyne, the other fisherman are stock characters, with simplified home lives or dilemmas to resolve (and the non-white typically gets less focus than his white co-workers).

George Clooney being a manly man, gritting his pearly whites and saving lives. Hey, this ain't E.R, folks. This is a real-life action drama.You may have heard of the Storm of the Century that smacked into New England in 1991. You might also have heard of the Andrea Gail, a small fishing boat caught smack dab in the middle of it. Of course, you might also have watched the documentary on MSNBC before this movie aired, and therefore you know the ending anyway. Luckily for me, I kept myself ignorant (a planned action, I assure you!), and had no idea what the end result was for this movie. And no, I'm not going to tell you the ending. Sure, I know, it's not exactly a twist ending, and you could find out on your own if you wanted. So go ahead, find out. We critics don't give away endings. It's part of the Critics Society secret waiver we signed.Anyway, here's the tale in a nutshell. Billy Tyne (Clooney) is a grizzled fishing-boat captain who pilots the Andrea Gail, owned by Bob Brown (Michael Ironside). Seems Billy's had a run of bad luck lately, and when he and rival fisherman Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, not too far from The Abyss) return from a run, he's the one with the lesser load. Gritting those teeth and raising a fist, Billy returns to the deep a scant two days after leaving it, determined to find some damn fish.His plan is to go further than usual. I'm no cartographer, but I can tell you his plan was to go a ways, then go further than that, because that's where the fish are, by gum. So our old salt rallies his crew together, and off they go. And fish they catch! Big ones, and of course there's the requisite crewmen-who-don't-like-each-other, and a nasty old shark, and all sorts of hilarious hijinks, just the sort of stuff you'd expect to see (no pun intended) in a movie about deep-sea fishing.So they have the fish, and they're heading back home, and they're so damn happy, and WHAM! They find out they're heading into a big ol' horkin' storm. You've seen the commercials - this is what it's all leading up to. So they have a choice - turn around and go the long way (and lose their fish, which would spoil) or go through that nasty old storm? Guess which one Billy wants to do.Among the other cast members, Mark Wahlberg does a solid, commanding job as greenhorn Bobby Shatford and John C. Reilly is a treat as veteran sailor Murph. Karen Allen and Diane Lane are relegated to small, thankfless roles.Ar, ar, me hearties! Batten down yer masts! See Clooney rage madly at the storm like King Lear! Hey, look, folks, it's simple. You wanna see George Clooney be a tough guy? Here's your movie. You want a story and believable characters? Go see Yentl.

The sad thing is, these grievances could easily have been edited out of the film, as they have nothing to do with the main characters or their story whatsoever.The film is based on the novel by Sebastion Junger, which in turn was based on actual events. In 1991, a Gloucester swordboat and its crew were caught up in a convergence of three storm systems, and the book fictionalized this story  while attempting to make it as close to what might have happened as possible. Perfect Storm follows the same characterizations detailed in Junger's book, along with its story arc.As Perfect Storm starts out, the Andrea Gail, a fishing boat Captained by Billy Tyne, played by George Clooney, pulls into a harbor in Gloucester. His haul is pitiful, and unable to take the failure, he plans to set out in the coming days once again in order to prove he has what it takes he conquer the sea. He takes along with him his rag-tag crew of men, and together they set out towards the horizon on a doomed voyage.The main story itself is solid. It captures the hardness and loneliness of the lives these men live. The moments making up this tale are powerful. Although built on time-worn clichés, such as the two feuding crewmates who end up friends after one saves the other's life, its easy to see through this when presented with such scenes as when Clooney and his men learn that the massive pull of swordfish they have brought in will be rotten in a few days, as their ice machine has broken. Its strong writing like this that helps to transcend the shortcomings that plague the other parts of the film.When the Gail and her men try and speed back home to salvage their catch, they head straight into the middle of the titular storm. The effects here by Industrial Light & Magic are excellent, and the water effects they have created for the crashing waves and bouncing ocean are impressive. Although the computer-generated models for the boats and aircraft are not quite as well-done, for the most part the special effects are excellent and put to good use.The cast is good, but the performances are mixed. Clooney does well, and Mark Whalberg as Bobby, a young fisherman hoping to start a family with his girlfriend, is equally fine. John C. Reilly, William Fichtner and John Hawkes fill out the rest of the main crew, and are all serviceably decent.Michael Ironside makes a cameo as Clooney's rough boss, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is also featured as a fellow swordboat Captain. Neither is given much to do, and it seems that they only exist in order to increase the number of useless sub-plots speckled throughout the course of the movie. Others include crewman Hawkes meeting with an overweight mother in the local pub and John C. Reilly leaving behind his young son, two occurrences which are almost never mentioned again.Other than these smaller plots which go nowhere, the chief problem with the film is that the main story is intercut with an even bigger useless sub-plot the tale of smaller rowboat that gets caught up in the raging storm, and the Coast Guard effort to rescue them. This is where Perfect Storm falters. Everytime the film cuts back to the Guard pilots attempting to rescue the tiny boat, and then save themselves, we're left wondering what might be happening to Clooney and his men. These scenes are superfluous in every way, only serving in one tensionless, overlong stretch to show us why Tyne and his crew are not going to be retrieved.During these scenes, it almost seems as if someone else is directing the movie besides Wolfgang Peterson. Best known for thrillers such as Das Boot and In The Line Of Fire, Peterson guides most of the film with a skilled, competent and secure hand. Clooney's haunting final scene, is the best of the movie, and when compared to the lackluster antics of the Coast Guard areas, it appears that The Perfect Storm is two different films, written and supervised by two different people.With some more coherent editing and a tighter script, Perfect Storm could have been a classic; however, as it remains, it is simply a good movie which could have been much better.Perfect Storm receives a 7.5 out of 10. "},{"Title":"Breathtaking, stupid and ignorant","Date":"13 July 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" Since 'Independence Day' I've been asking myself pretty often, why the most patriotic American movies are directed by Germans. 'ID4' was the most patriotic film I still remember, 'In the Line of Fire' and 'Air Force One' were also good examples. Now comes Petersen with his 'Storm' and creates another type of patriotism. And Emmerich? Well, he comes with 'The Patriot'. Isn't this strange. I now, Americans don't criticize patriotism in movies (I experienced that very often) but as a German it's so obvious and disturbing, that it ruined all of the films above. I will never understand the love for a country. But beside that I had a lot of other things in mind while I watched 'The Perfect Storm'.Let's say something about the actors first. Let's say, well, they did everything they could. With a screenplay, that surely didn't exist, they have to fight with dialogue which is so stupid, it's hard to suppress a laugh. But they do their job well. Clooney is always fine to watch and the rest of the cast is really okay. Diane Lane even surprised me with her acting.But that leads me directly to the dialogue and the screenplay. It's based on Sebastian Jungers book and if you know it you know how much they could take for the screenplay. But not that less. When Clooney describes his life as a fisherman to Mastrantonio it's impossible not to laugh. To use that dialogue as the last lines of the film is a big mistake. And to show the little boy who waves at the boat is the biggest. Other example?Michael Ironside plays the obligatory bad boss who only thinks about money. When the Andrea Gail is in the storm everybody sits in the Crow's Nest and watches TV to hear any news. Ironside comes in and tells them, very concerned, that there is not much hope. He seems very emotional then. Lane, who is angry, screams at him 'Do you think we should be proud of you, because you dared to come in here?' Ironside, with an serious, close to crying, expression says 'Yes.' I couldn't believe it.But the worst thing of all is the conflict between Murph (John C. Reilly) and Sully (William Fichtner). They argue when they meet first in the bar. They argue on the boat. And again and again and again. The point is that nobody in no single word explains why. They just argue and fight because in the screenplay was written 'Sully and Murph don't like each other and argue all the time.' Sully has an interesting job, by the way. Clooney hires him, because he needs him, but on the boat he doesn't do anything else but giving the other fishermen lights. And he doesn't do his job very well.I could go on and on, but it's to annoying. I think I made it clear that the dialogue is the last reason to watch this film. But it still is worth watching and the only reason for this is the storm itself. What ILM and its effects guys did here is unbelievable. These are of course the best special effects this year and for a long time. The storm sequences are so suspenseful and exciting and amazing that you forget every sentence that was spoken. The best thing they could have done was to also generate the characters in the computer. This hour of storm makes the money really worth spending. Really.But at the end I have to say something else which annoyed me pretty much. To say that they glorified the swordfishing is an understatement. At several times it is said that swordfishing is the best thing in the world. We see them catch one fish after another and it's filmed with such a joy, you want to jump on the boat and cut a fish's head of. What was absolutely forgotten by all this was how much the fishing industry killed life in the sea. It's no wonder the boats catch so less fish. There just isn't pretty much they have left. At one point they catch a shark and no one says what a waste of life it is to just kill him, because he's a 'evil' shark. Bang! and they throw him overboard. Finally got rid of another evil creature. If the fishing industry goes on like this there will not be any fish in the sea. Since 1600 there were millions of fish killed in the seas and a lot of species were killed to extinction. The film should be dedicated to these forgotten species and the enormous amount of life which was killed instead of the few 10.000 fishermen who achieved this. To show killed fishermen as if they died for something honorable shows again the egoism and arrogance of our culture.

These forty minutes mean to generate our sympathy and liking for the characters and make us emotionally invested in their fates, yet to me it felt more like fourty minutes of boring and bad melodrama. Now, I consider myself a total sap; I weep uncontrollably each time I watch Titanic, City of Angels and dozens of other Hollywood weepies. I'm not one of those people who roll their eyes every time a movie tries to tug at the heartstrings and scream 'cheesy melodrama!' every time there's a slightest showing of emotion in a Hollywood movie. But even I found myself by turns giggling and cringing at the awful, awful melodrama (as opposed to GOOD melodrama), accompanied by the intrusive score which reminded you exactly what you're supposed to feel at this or that moment. I nearly laughed out loud when George Clooney gave his ridiculous 'Oh how do I love thee, sea' speech. I wasn't a particularly big fan of George Clooney before, and now that I've seen him in 'The Perfect Storm' I'm definitely starting to feel that he's better off back on the small screen. He just doesn't seem to have the kind of silver screen presence and charisma that marks a true star like, say, Mel Gibson, and found it hard to believe that his character was the kind of a leader that the other men would follow. I was far more impressed with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and her strong and no-nonsense character; unfortunately she is virtually ignored for the rest of the movie.So, with no characters I could admire or sympathise with on 'Andrea Gail', I was far more enthralled with the parallel story of the Coast guard team and their courageous attempts to save the passengers of the little sailboat that too got trapped in the storm. Now, these were the men whose actions I could admire, in fact I believe that I would have enjoyed the movie more if only they were made the central characters instead of a bunch of people whose greed precedes their common sense. I mean no disrespect to the actual people who lost their lives in the storm, but that's exactly how this film paints them as the reckless fishermen whose choice to risk their lives for the sake of $250,000 worth of fish was motivated purely by money, nothing else. While their choice was justifiable, it just didn't make for a satisfying movie experience.On the plus side, I must congratulate the team responsible for the effects. During the whole run of the film, it never occured to me to think, wow, I'm watching cool CGI waves. The sea looks and feels absolutely real, and gives you a true sense of Mother Nature gone berserk. There was also an amazing aerial shot, initially placed over the two storms and a hurricane, which then dived below through the swirling clouds to show us the black raging waves lashing back and forth on the ocean level. That shot sent shivers down my spine, truly powerful stuff.Unfortunately, the initial impact of the furious sea didn't last for more than half an hour, with me getting used to the sight of crashing waves and the whole affair starting to feel fairly monotonous. Add to that zero emotional engagement, and what you have for the last twenty minutes is tiredness and boredom, somewhat livened up by the big money shot of a huge wave we all saw in the trailer. In the whole, a 5 star experience.

The Perfect Storm is a movie filled with realistic stormy scenes, well performed make-up. As another user commented They really look like fishermen and I must say it is quite an act to make George Clooney look like an experienced fisherman.But realistic scenes alone don't make a good movie, and just as Das Boot is just a little too long, I think the Perfect Storm is too much Storm and just a little too little Perfect. The acting is superb (especially Mark Wahlberg) and so is the directing by Wolfgang Petersen. However something is missing, but it is hard to put a finger on it. The story is a little too brief, it feels like the movie tells a tale, but leaves out all the interesting stuff and concentrates on the action. It starts great (the first hour is among the best I have ever seen), but after a hundred waves I felt I had had enough and wanted to wave goodbye.Next time, use a little less water and just a little more script and the movie will be among the best ever made!

When it does, it's amazing.  Rendered in mind-blowing CGI, it is utterly spectacular.  But this very spectacle actually works against the film as depicted, the storm is so fierce and so realistic that you simply cannot believe anyone would even be able to STAND UP on the boat, let alone climb atop the bridge to fix the antenna, attempt to board up the windows, or have time for heartfelt goodbyes - not with the ship lurching at what looks like 89 degrees in 300 knot winds with 4000 cubic liters of water crashing onto the deck every three seconds.  It was just too much to take.  Sure, it looks great.  But is that the only point?  Maybe in this market, at this time of year, it is.In any case, there's something a little tasteless about the whole affair.  The film is based on true story.  Real people died.  To embellish their tragedy with spurious story elements, imaginary conflicts, and fantasized romances as a means of packaging 60 minutes of CGI for the 'event film' summer market - and then to have the gall to promote it as a 'true story' - may well be a savvy bit of marketing, but it strikes me as more than a little distasteful.  It dishonors the memory of those who died by turning their tragedy into a Saturday night's entertainment for the rest of us.  But I guess that's Hollywood.

What a pity the film seems to forget this and the people who died and those who still live to mourn their loved ones, and plunge into an orgy of special effects and woefully thin characterisations which only serve to undermine the drama of what went on in 1991 off the Grand Banks.The vfx are great - the cgi waves are dammed realistic and the sense of the menacing, tossing storm front is utterly compelling. For me this was by far the best part of the film.The rest was forgettable. The characters were poorly introduced and spent far too long in the bar trying to set themselves and their relationships up before going off to make their big kill and bring home the bacon.  It sounded phoney and made me wish they'd just go to sea and get on with it. And when they did I felt actually quite disgusted with them - greedy, selfish and stupid. I can't believe the real fishermen acted with such poor judgment. I was on the side of the swordfish for most of the fishing trip, poor things.The dialogue was lame and the entire screenplay felt padded and contrived. The conflicts between the fishermen seemed as though the writers realized they didn't have enough of a story and had to invent some more.And don't these guys ever wear lifejackets? Their seamanship seemed unprofessional at best - how many times do people need to get washed overboard before they realize they ought to be wearing some sort of life preservation?I felt for the poor guys who had to rescue these people. They were the real heroes as far as I was concerned.This is where I felt the film fell down the most - it lacked any real human heart and soul. I should have cared that real people lost their lives and others mourned for them. But somehow this message got lost in the (numerous) waves which swamped the boats and eventually swamped the film. The ending was syrupy - as if the director was apologizing for what happened and had to make the audience feel better.This should have been filmable. I've watched plenty of real-life films where it has been pulled off with style.

I kept waiting five more minutes for the storm to start because there was absolutely no character development whatsoever so what did it matter who they were?  If I had stayed for the end, I probably would have been making up stories about the characters just to feel sorry for them.++++ spoilers ahead ++++  In fact, I am still laughing, as I just read a review that confirmed my suspicions about one of the film's most moronic subplots the two fisherman who constantly argue and fight (complete with requisite woman stepping in between them and telling them to grow up), whom we know not why they hate each other, or really anything, and I mean, ANYTHING, about either of them.  I could find absolutely NO possible reason these two characters were arguing, i.e. to illustrate some point about either or the characters, the life of a fisherman, problems at sea?, so, judging from the rest of the far-too-obvious-and-too-stupid plot already at that point, I just KNEW, and what a frightening thought this was, that one would save the other in the end, and they would bond.  How many times have you seen that one?  The thing is, it was soooo obvious.  Anyway, reading a review confirmed this and I am still laughing (at the stupidity).The scene that made me leave at the start of the storm was so hilarious. After a long dry spell, where the men complain about Clooney the captain for their bad luck and sulk in their quarters and one reads an fifthgraders poem about him, they go on deck and start to catch a giant shark. The boat tips conveniently and said shark slides on deck and bites one of the men through the calf.  This was probably one of the dumbest, most pointless scenes. Precisely because I was just waiting for the fokking storm to come already, and here was this lame action scene which had absolutely no relevance to the characters or the storm.  We hear nothing about this scene before or after, its just kind of thrown in.  And its so laughable.  What looks like buckets of water are thrown on deck repeatedly, so all we see is the water, the deck and the biting shark.If you really must see this movie, I suggest looking for the sheer absurdity in the sharkbite scene, just so you can laugh (at the directors, that is). In fact, if you are looking for a summer comedy, this is IT.I also laughed out loud during a scene where one of the nameless fishermen wakes up with his girlfriend the day he goes off to the boat (there were all sorts of these pseudo-this-is-life scenes which were completely inane) and he notices he has a black eye.  He says something like, Did you do this to me?  And she says very meanly and seriously something like, I dont know. Maybe.  I should have also broken both your legs so you couldn't go on this trip.  Whaaaaaaaaat?  I sat there, stunned, for a few seconds.  My mind just Reeled.  Were we finally getting into some development, where this was an abusive (albeit unconventionally abusive) relationship and the woman is such a cooze she beats him up and then makes references to disabling him so she can keep him around the house?  The question was never answered.  Did she give him a black eye during sex the nite before? (huh? that also seems abusive, if it did happen, or maybe they were really heavy into s&m), or, we are left to guess, did she turn over in her sleep and punch him real hard by accident?  I still have no idea of what this scene was about, and no one in the theater seemed to notice the inconsistencies.  I found myself making up a story that the actor who played the part got in a fight the nite before the shoot, and they had no makeup, and so quickly made up a few lines about the eye in a scene that was supposed to be something else.  It wouldn't have surprised me one bit, considering how slipshod and half-assed the whole movie was.  I laughed so hard and loud, out of sheer disbelief, and I never laugh out loud unless its a comedy, but the theatre was otherwise silent, all gripped attentively.The only time I heard the audience laugh was a bar scene where the dorky, greasy rednecky lousy poet fisherman tried to pick up an obese woman. People seemed to find this hilarious.  I think the humor was supposed to be that she was fat.  It seemed odd in a movie with otherwise very traditionally beautiful women in every scene (except for, of course, any mothers) (even look in the background of the bar scenes, which is on a fishing dock the men look like they haven't bathed in a year and the women look like they spend the entire time in the bathroom dressing in the hippest of clothes, just Dying to catch a fisherman).  It was supposed to be even more funny that the greasy fisherman couldn't get even her.  She even made the oh-so-original comment about him thinking with his other head.The last hilarious scene is in the bar, (almost all the scenes that dont take place on the boat take place on a dock or in the bar) where every single person is drinking budweiser.  (we arent supposed to see that). It's obvious the barset was stocked only with bud, as if, once again, the slipshod directors did not have enough money or brains to get perhaps one six pack of something else just for the shot.  Also, the only thing on tap was bud.  All the bottles being drunk are bud.  And there is a bud sign outside (which is often blurred out ?).Hah hah hah hah hah!

After watching A Perfect Storm I think I'll just hop the border with the rest of the cowards.I certainly don't have the bravery to decide to punch through the storm of the century.   I get scared when the waves at the beach get over 5 feet, so I can't even imagine going up against waves ten times that big.

While every other boat is making a killing in the fish market, the crew of the Andrea Gail is having problems catching a cold. Word among the crew is George Clooney has lost it.   One crew member even decides to desert to a different boat.So it is with bruised pride that Captain Clooney orders his crew back out to sea for one last trip before the start of the storm season.   At first this trip starts off just like all the rest, badly.   However, the crews luck begins to change once they travel to the Flemish Cap, an area with a lot of fish and a lot of weather as one character puts it.   The Andrea Gale becomes a fishing machine, catching over 60 pounds worth of fish.   That's worth about a quarter of a million dollars once back in port.And so ends the Andrea Gale's good luck.   An ice machine breaks down, and without it the fish are sure to spoil unless taken back to port immediately. Not to mention Hurricane Grace is blocking the only route back home.   So the crew is faced with two choices Avoid the storm and let the fish spoil or go straight through it and make a lot of money.   The crew decides to go straight through it.   There's nothing like regaining your pride and a hell of a lot of money to make people forget about the dangers of dying.While the storm sequences in The Perfect Storm are both action packed and emotional, the rest of the movie seems to be lacking the same passion.   The writer decided that the audience wanted to know, or for that matter, cared about the life of a fisherman.   Instead of cool special effects we get a 45 minute long fishing lesson.   I didn't pay 8 dollars for a fishing lesson, I paid to see some big waves, and I was none to pleased with what I got instead.The writer also tries,  to make the audience more attached to the crew by giving each one a personal problem to overcome.   Personally, I still didn't care about any of the characters, but I appreciate the writers effort all the same.   In all honesty, I was much more interested in the nameless Coast Guard rescue team, than I ever was in the crew of the Andrea Gail.   At some points I even found myself wishing the movie would focus more on the rescue team, who I saw as the true hero's of the film, rather than the crew, which the movie was trying to make heroic, when really all they did was make a stupid mistake.I feel bad giving this movie a bad review knowing that it's based on a true story.   I don't mean to be disrespectful to the dead, but even the writer knew the story of the Andrea Gail was a little thin, which explains the scenes involving the Coast Guard and the lost sailing boat, both of which have nothing to do with the doomed fishing boat.

Not coincidentally, I'm sure, he was the only actor casted for the movie who wasn't forced to use a Massachusetts accent.  How convenient for you, eh, Mr. Clooney?  I'm sure you wouldn't want to try flexing what little acting muscles you may have, no matter how weak they are.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's part was too small and insignificant for an actress of her caliber.  The story wouldn't have drastically changed if her part didn't even exist.  Another typical character in this movie was played by Mark Wahlberg, known for his roles as a dumb kid aching to change his life for the better.  The acting was unimpressive.Characters are thrown in simply for effect.  Sure, the movie emphasizes survival in horrid conditions, but tossing unknown vacationers into the plot out of nowhere and spending much time showing what these people--who the viewer doesn't even care about due to a lack of background story--are doing is just bad screen-writing, in my opinion.The theme of the movie, one would believe, is about bravery in dangerous times, and while multiple themes are not necessarily a bad thing, the idea of everlasting love did not mesh well with the rest of this story.All in all, it was a poor film wrapped around amazing visual effects.  But guess what; all of the rain, waves, and wind in the world couldn't save this movie from drowning in lack of quality.  Don't bother wasting your time or your money.

George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are great actors and Industrial Light & Magic can do great special effects.  Why do these variables NOT add up to a great film?  Let's give it a run-through  Gloucester, Mass is a fishing town.  That's the love of their life.  They run to meet battle weary fisherman coming home from a long hard journey.  However, when one fisherman (George Clooney) and his mates deliver an unsatisfactory stock of swordfish, they return to the sea to become Mariner Heroes and bring home an armada of ocean life.  The crewmen learn that that's easier said than done, as they encounter one of the worst storms this side of the Bermuda Triangle. Not giving anything away, I must say that this movie's introduction of the characters is a bore.  It's not until Clooney and his team head out to sea where it gets interesting. The effects are great, especially when the storm goes full volume.  Then Hollywood chimes in with it's cliche riddled dialog and scenarios, as almost every single character in this movie becomes a hero.  There is even an attack from a certain 25 year old named Bruce.  Once the storm struck, the continuation lost my interest.  One final gripe  James Horner is a great composer.  He has won many Oscars, and my favorite score of his was the one for Aliens.  However, who did Warner Bros actually hire to direct this movie?  Peterson, whose film credits include Das Boot, the Never-Ending Story, and In the Line of Fire, or James Horner, whose musical score in NON-STOP throughout the entire movie.  It's wave to wave music.  Warner (or maybe even Peterson himself) gave Mr. Horner way too much power.  When all is said and done, the only good thing about The Perfect Storm is the fact that it is based on a true story, but try not to adhere so much to actual events depicted in this one.

We need men to catch those fish. Who's going to do it? You, Marky Mark? You're not a fisherman. You don't even know what you want.I want to fish!You can't handle the fish!With awful dialogue lifted from cut scenes of the last five years of military dramas, The Perfect Storm is a pathetic story told by idiots, full of storms and furies, signifying nothing. It is a tortuous experience to watch, as every time a character opens their mouth something horrible, cliched, and melodramatic comes out. I found myself cringing when I knew dialogue was imminent.The Perfect Storm is about a group of fisherman from Gloucester, Massachusetts who keep coming up short on their swordfish hauls. At their Captain's request they choose to go out again for one last time in late October, the beginning of storm season. What they didn't know is that three storm systems were converging in a meteorological phenomenon. These storms collide behind them as they cross the Great Banks, sealing them off from home. They go out further than they should, get a huge haul of fish, and turn around into the mouth of the colossus. Their friends and family back at home drink themselves silly while waiting for any news.George Clooney plays Billy Tyne, Captain of the Andrea Gail, the doomed ship. At one point Tyne barks at Mark Wahlberg's Bobby Shatford character that's an order! I just want to clarify something here when you are called Captain on a commercial swordfish boat, you're not really a Captain in the military use of the title. You've got the license, you've got the lease on the boat, and sure, it's your ship to pilot and steer. But don't let it get to your head. You're not a real Captain. Your crew of miscreant, drunken fisherman aren't going to follow your orders in a chain of command. Why? Because they're fisherman, not soldiers. In fact, you're more the equivalent of a breakfast cereal mascot in that you both can be addressed as Cap'n.There could have been a good story here, but the writer blew it. I have not read Sabastian Junger's book, even though it was a bestseller and apparently made its GQ (both looks and substance) author famous. I can tell you that the screenplay that Bill Wittliff adapted from it is drain clog material. Not only are the characters, dialogue, and relationships entirely contrived and laughably stupid, but the execution of these people by the actors and director Wolfgang Petersen is vacuous and retarded. I have to make a distinction here, in that the film jumps back and forth between action at sea and drama at home. The drama at home was mindless drivel and a complete waste of time. The action at sea, including the Coast Guard Aviation Survival Technicians' rescue of a sailing vessel, is exciting and directed with oceanic action expertise (Petersen is after, the man behind Das Boot). However, the contrite, empty, cliched dialogue between Clooney, Wahlberg, and the rest of the dramatic cast (including their respective romantic interests) lacks any compulsion or interest enough to sustain it through the half of the film that it occupies. The story at sea is a complete fiction, so there can be no excuse that the authors did not have complete creative license to tell whatever story they wanted of these fishermen. The only facts on record would be a brief, stuccato radio communication and then a lot of silence.The Coast Guard rescue is a subplot, a tip of the hat in honor of their actions and courage while also underlining the severity of the storm. Most of what I got from this small portion of the film is that if you ever need to be out at sea, the Coast Guard has the best gadgets for survival and rescue. In fact, forget life preservers. Just get yourself a Coast Guard special unit. They can inflate a six man raft out of a pocket on their jump-suit, they can swim over 50 foot waves, and they can see a mile in whipping rain. I assume in a pinch they can ride tandem dolphins like Aquaman. It seems that in an effort to be kind to the memory of these fishermen and the community, the filmmakers wanted to concentrate on the love the characters had for their friends and family. This was nauseating. Far too long is spent on these (barely even) two dimensional characters. I have absolutely no interest in the new apartment Bobby has waiting for him. I can empathize with his character being torn between going out on one more run and the money it brings in against staying at home with his girlfriend who has harbinger dreams; but then I'm done. I don't need a fifth of the film devoted to these beer swilling people. Give me enough material to attach to them, not long enough to notice the facial hair inconsistencies.We're given a couple scenes with a weatherman in Boston who explains the storm system with Pictionary level intelligence and finger pointing. Unfortunately, the appearance of Christopher McDonald in any dramatic role, even TV weatherman, is a sign of doom. He's campy - by accident. I remember him on the Tracy Ullman show and finding him car-salesman smug. It just got sillier when he started dancing well. At any rate, this could have been the meat of their story a la the excitement of Twister's weather hounds, but this was wholly overlooked in favor of misty shots of Bobby Shatford's fiancee and mother.I would have liked to see a real explanation of the weather system that was happening; that is an El Nino front causing multiple vortices and colliding systems resulting in an explosive and rare weather phenomenon. There is only one beauty pass of the camera flying into the hurricane, but this should have been expanded and brought back in detail. If Industrial Light + Magic were going to spend the time developing a fluid dynamic system to produce the massive waves and then add particle effects to mimic blowing white cap effects, and then go so far as to model and detail hurricane behavior then why on earth wouldn't they make a film that exploited this visual excitement?Secondly, hundreds of thousands of people make their living as fishermen at sea. This is rarely shown in films, other than as background scenery while cops shoot at each other through fishmonger kiosks. I would like to have seen more of the fishermen and their trade. I enjoyed the parts of the film where the crew was working, baiting, and fishing. In fact, even the parts I didn't necessarily like would appeal to people who like to fish. Big fish catching is very popular, otherwise there wouldn't be ESPN shows about it. I didn't need more than ten minutes to set up the relationships of the fishermen at home (instead of the thirty five minutes the film took). Take your main cast out to sea and concentrate on the life of the merchant fisherman. Cook up your weather system details, hell - even give local TV news a taste of Hollywood effects treatment with shots of the maps behind the weather people exploding in detail.Get the fear factor going through detailed explanations of what we know is about to happen to our heroes, kind of like Quint's stories in Jaws that make the whole experience more frightening. Then, WHAM! the storm hits and you shove your audience into the tandem stories of the Coast Guard rescue and fisherman fighting their way back home.This movie, billing itself as an action drama, fails miserably at its drama and scuttles its action by having no story. I hated the way the actors worked with each other. None of the rapport between Clooney and Wahlberg was allowed to come through the disgusting dialogue. Bill Fichnter and John C. Reilly's loggerheads was a poorly constructed and therefore useless diversion. The music by James Horner was completely inappropriate and excruciating. The times that the movie became exciting and interesting, the score was wholly unpleasant.The Perfect Storm is simply a perfectly bad movie.

The first hour is chock-full of the cigarette-smoking, beer-drinking, and making-out action that you'd expect in a movie about some fishermen caught in the midst of the perfect storm.  Yes, those minutes rocketed by like a crippled slug and tried to give us background information on the characters so we'd feel sorry for them throughout their ordeal.  Instead of feeling sorry for them, I felt nothing for them.  The futile attempts at proving that they had something to go back to were just silly and clichéd at the best.  George Clooney's character had a picture of his children who lived in Florida to make us feel sorry for him.Marky Mark had a girlfriend or wife or mistress or whatever the hell she was to constantly make out with whenever they were on screen together and to run down the pier with open arms when he comes back from sea.One of the others had some woman he met in a bar one night who showed no interest in him whatsoever but became his soulmate the next day.  One other had a son who he took with him to drink beer and play pool and watch Marky Mark and his girlfriend/wife/mistress make out and another had some kind of metal shop where he... did stuff.  Another had a blonde girlfriend who was used soley for the purpose of making out in the first hour of the picture. Suddenly, in the middle somewhere, we get a subplot of Karen Allen, some Mr. Thurston Howell-ish guy, and some other woman who are in a boat in the middle of the perfect storm.  We see them arguing about going home, because it's Mr. Howell's boat and he wants to ride the storm out.  Then we're back to George Clooney and his motley crew of flat characters.  Some fishing excitement (including the shark from the Universal Studios Jaws ride), then back to Karen Allen and the millionaire and his wife, then back to Clooney, then to the coast guard, then back to nowhere.Finally we see the fishermen get hit with the perfect storm and we see some good special effects.  Like most summer blockbusters, the special effects are usually the best parts of the movie.  That was the case in this one.Now, I'm not gonna spoil the ending if you really even care about it, but I will say that you don't give a damn if the characters live or die at the end, including Karen Allen and Mr. Howell and his wife.

In the end this strikes me as something of a misbegotten movie project In the book the storm is the focal point, even the hero if you like; but because movie stars are present the storm has to turn into the villain. We lose Sebastian Junger's perspective on the relationship of Man, Nature, and Chance -- all of which combined to make the storm perfect, reported by Junger with more than a little admiration even as he sympathizes with the fishermen and their loved ones.

Ever since seeing Boogie Nights on cable I've been an enthusiastic Mark Wahlberg fan.  Wahlberg and George Clooney had great rapport in Three Kings, and my expectations for TPS were raised even higher when I learned that John C. Reilly (so terrific in Boogie Nights) was going to be in it as well.  It also sounded like a riveting story.Well, I am sorry to report that TPS was a major disappointment.  6 stars out of 10, tops.  Even though it breaks many of the conventions of the Hollywood blockbuster -- unglamorous characters, unhappy ending -- it ends up being just another big movie where the special effects overwhelm the human side of the story.   Not because the F/X are so good (yes, they're impressive, though the computerized water still looks a bit fake much of the time) but because the human side is so badly developed and badly written.The actors, for the most part, do the best they can with their paper-thin characters.  Clooney, I thought, was no more than OK as Captain Billy Tyne (he was much better in Three Kings).  John C. Reilly, as Murph, was very affecting in the scene with his son, but then after that he had nothing to do except for that stupid feud with William Fichtner's character, Sully (which had no point except to set the stage for the cliche scene where Sully saves his life and they finally bond).  Wahlberg, as Bobby Shatford, was excellent in the early scenes with Lane and with his mother (convincing performance by Janet Wright as the mother, but Lane mostly alternates between two one-key modes shrill and grieving).   Once on the boat, though, he and Clooney had surprisingly little chemistry.What's more, there is a major problem with the characterization of Bobby Shatford, Wahlberg's character.  In the scenes with his girlfriend Christine (Diane Lane), it's pretty clear that Bobby wants nothing more than to settle down with her and the fishing's just the best way he can make a living (the safer jobs on land don't pay as much).  In fact, he promises her that he's giving it up after this one last trip (and of course, if you didn't already know the boy wasn't coming back, that line was a dead giveaway).   Yet suddenly, once they're out to sea, it turns out that Bobby LOVES to fish -- it's not just a living, it's a passion.  So which is it?The crucial scene where the fishermen make the fatal decision to go back through the storm packs little emotional punch, because it is made too easily.  Someone (Bobby? Murph?) should have been opposed to it.  That would have set up some REAL dramatic conflict, as opposed to the contrived conflict between Muph and Sully.And the dialogue... dear Lord, the dialogue!  If I had a dime for every cheesy line in this movie it would have more than made up for the $5.50 I spent on the matinee ticket.  I thought the sea was your home.  I think she's a helluva boat. -- With a helluva crew.  -- With a helluva skippuh. He's my precious boy and you're the woman for him.  Not to mention gems like This is the moment of truth.... this is what separates the men from the boys, or Clooney's pretentious ode to the glories of being a swordboat captain.I can't even say that the movie delivers on the promise of white-knuckle thrills. The Coast Guard rescue scenes were good but too long.  As for the action on the Andrea Gail, much of it was repetitive (Clooney and Wahlberg getting pelted with water).  Frankly, too, this is where knowing that they all die undercuts the suspense.Yes, there were some very good scenes.  The scene between Wahlberg and Lane where they wake up in the morning.  The humorous but moving little story line between Bugsy (John Hawkes) and Irene (Rusty Schwimmer), the woman he tries to pick up at the bar.  Later on, one scene that was very powerful, both visually and emotionally, was when the sun suddenly comes out and the guys think that the storm is over and they've made it -- only to realize, seconds later, that it's NOT over.  That was a lump-in-the-throat kind of moment.Finally, great scene of the Andrea Gail's demise Wahlberg swims out of the capsized boat while Clooney stays behind and we see his figure being swallowed by pitch-black darkness; then the boat seems to right itself, only to sink instantly; and there is Wahlberg, a lone speck of humanity in a vast raging sea, amidst hurricane-force winds, torrential rains, giants waves. What a terrifying and poignant image; what a powerful expression of the tragedy of man crushed by nature's wrath.  And then the filmmakers had to go and ruin it all with Bobby's maudlin psychically telegraphed speech to his girlfriend -- Can you hear me, Christine?  I love you... there's no goodbyes, only love -- and the ghostly apparition of Lane in the left corner of the screen.  I am not a cynic but there's a big difference between true feeling and mawkish sentimentality.  I thought the scene of Kate and Leo's final farewell in Titanic was corny beyond belief, but this takes the cake.And just when you thought it couldn't get any hokier, the movie ends with a replay of Clooney's isn't it great to be a swordboat captain speech... it's bad enough that we had to hear it the first time around! I half-expected to see a ghostly apparition of Clooney smiling beatifically at Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio from fisherman heaven.Bill Witliff, the screenwriter, should henceforth be known as Bill Witless.Wahlberg deserves a better screenplay.  Come to think of it, so does just about everyone else in this movie.

Never mind that the material is entirely unsuited to the screen millions of people bought it, and some of those may have even read it, so what more do you want? Well, to begin with, how about something other than the usual Cartesian marketplace logic (I sell, therefore I am) as a reason for making the film in the first place? Junger's book covers a lot of territory and juggles more than one life-or-death crisis, dwelling in particular on the fate of the fishing trawler Andrea Gail, lost at sea with all hands, and the devastating effect of its disappearance on the close-knit seaside town of Gloucester, Massachusetts. In print the multiple focus makes perfect sense it's a maritime epic of men and women struggling against the implacable fury of the elements. But the unrelated parallel story lines (the primary one unresolved no wreckage or bodies were ever recovered) don't lend themselves to easy adaptation, and screenwriter Bill Whitliff clearly wasn't up to the challenge.Of course no one expects such a willfully dumbed down dramatization to capture all the nuances of a good book. But Whitliff's strictly perfunctory script follows an all too dispiriting path of least resistance, attempting (fatally) to touch all the same narrative bases as its source, without even a token attempt to capture the raw documentary power of Junger's prose. Instead we get a shipload of cardboard cutouts straight from central casting, pointlessly battling against computer generated ninety-foot waves before making their inevitable, noble descent to Davy Jones' Locker.Keep in mind that every scene on board the doomed trawler is pure speculation, which may explain all the narrative whitewash. No doubt the producers felt obliged to appease the local Gloucester community (without whose blessing the film couldn't have been made) by showing their dearly departed in such a phony, flattering light. But for the surviving friends and family of the missing fishermen the lackluster results can hardly be called a comforting legacy, reducing a tragic true story to the same crass, commercial level of any other overblown FX extravaganza, complete with high profile Hollywood talent (George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, as Captain Billy Tyne and shipmate Bobby Shatford) lovingly photographed in screen-filling, video format close-ups.A faux-heroic music score by James Horner overlays every scene with a thick coating of saccharine gloss, and the whole package was (mis)directed by Wolgang Peterson, at the time still riding the reputation of his breakthrough international hit 'Das Boot'. The 1981 film was Peterson's ticket out of the European art house ghetto, but in all the years since then he hasn't made anything half as interesting or memorable. Certainly few other directors could succeed as well in making the wide Atlantic Ocean look like a sound-stage water tank.The (undeniably exciting) digital tempest is the only reason to recommend the film, a sad fact suggesting another lesson in Tinsel Town commerce even the most slapdash feature can return a handsome profit with the addition of a few expensive visual effects. 'The Perfect Storm' is an ideal case in point, being one of those (now common) movies in which the camera-work is totally subservient to the lab work. But did it really need to otherwise be such a generic, empty experience? The pragmatic answer would have to be yes, if the only motivation behind the film was to make a fistful of money. In general, the more expensive the movie, the less risks it can afford to take in order to recoup its production costs. Which, in the end, makes it easy to see why the one perfect thing about 'The Perfect Storm' was its capacity to sell a lot of popcorn.

Even worse than the uninspiring characters are the music selections, most of the time best suited to the movie moment the junior gets a home run in a softball game. Men wasting their lives in the dangerous sea deserve some more dramatic music than what is best described by adjectives bland, hopeful and most of all cliched.

The Perfect Storm is one of those summer movies I crave for, something that is relentless and is not stupid or clumsy in its execution. The Perfect Storm was undoubtedly one of the best films of the summer of 2000. In fact, the Summer of 2000 was actually not a bad summer for movies, there were movies like Gladiator, X-Men, and the first Scary Movie. Sure there were movies I didnt like, for example Mission Impossible 2.I am not a fan of Wolfgang Petersen, although the reason for that maybe I never saw Das Boot. I found Air Force One to be lacking many things, especially the intensity which is here. The Perfect Storm is not flawless, in fact the dialogue is kind of corny in areas. The Perfect Storm contains breathtaking visual effects. The waves are so real you we feel like your in the storm. The big wave which is the climax at the end is a magnificent piece of work. The Perfect Storm also has a score during the storm (most notably during the Andrea Gail Scenes) that contributes to the thrill of the experience. The performances are not bad. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and the rest that make up the Andrea Gail crew all give credible performances. Diane Lane does a good job for what shes in. I had a hard time seeing Mary Mastrano (Dont know how to spell her last name) as Linda Greenlaw, she seems a bit too pretty to do this. Theres alot going on in The Perfect Storm, more people are involved during the Storm. While there scenes are not as thrilling as the Andrea Gail scenes they certainly have there thrills. Were more involved with the characters in the Andrea Gail sequences so we wont care as much what happens to these other characters. The Perfect Storm is a very entertaining two hours that rarely drags. Like I said, The Perfect Storm is not flawless but it contains enough intense moments for the viewer to be satisfied.

While the film (through it's cliched, unbelievable characterizations) does manage to pay tribute to these men and their peers, it only entertains to a point.  For one thing, it takes an hour to wade through a series of dull scenes leading up to the big event. A set of unsavory sailors with proverbial hearts of gold are shown with their idealized friends and family (who nearly all seem to telegraph dread and disaster from the beginning of the film on!)  Ratty clothes and mussed hair do not cover up the stock characters who must bear very little actual resemblance to the humans involved in this story.  The script of this film is rancid.  A few of the actors manage to rise above it's ineptness and provide performances (notably Clooney), but mostly it's sub-TV movie claptrap.  When the big storm finally appears, it is just a wealth of CGI effects mixed with studio blue screen work.  Nothing about the storm or it's devastation is for one moment believable because it is too, too stylized and obviously (especially on DVD) manufactured by someone at a computer desk. Everything is too in this film.  The characters are too idealized, the music is too grandiose--much at odds with the gritty people and their surroundings, the effects are too fancy for their own good and the story is too fabled and heroic.  Foolhardy fishermen decided to ignore nature and paid for it.  Here they are depicted as superhuman heroes who calmly accept their fate, manage all sorts of physically impossible acts and embrace martyrdom.  A moving, thrilling film could have been made from this tragic story, but this isn't it.  It's phony in every department and overblown as well.  A needless, drawn out subplot involving a small sailboat only adds to the running time.  Can anyone explain why men who live on steak, eggs, greasy lasagna and buckets of ice cream would have Molly McButter in their pantry??

I would never have watched it except that it was mentioned twice in a noncommittal way in a book I had just finished reading, Stuart Pimm's The World According to Pimm A Scientist Audits the Earth (2001). It starts out like something from any of half a dozen big project Hollywood directors, e.g., James Cameron (Titanic) or Lasse Hallstrom (Chocolat), with faux realism and intrusive atmospheric sights and sounds and bits of background sound-bite conversations played too loud. I'm already shifting in my seat when I realize that Wolfgang Petersen, who produced and directed The Perfect Storm is none other than the very same Wolfgang Petersen who produced and directed the internationally acclaimed German language classic, Das Boot (1981), one of the best war movies of all time. So now I'm thinking, how bad can this be?Turns out that The Perfect Storm is one of those movies that can't decide whether it's a man's action flick or a woman's relationship saga. Petersen spends an inordinate amount of time giving each of his crew members some kind of relationship before sending them off into the mother of all storms, reminding me of movies where the guys go away to war and the women stay behind keeping the home fires burning. Enough time is spent in the bar to make me think we're watching Cheers or we're on shore leave before the final assault. Strange thing about this is that Petersen, in making Das Boot, didn't care in the slightest about establishing relationships or engaging the female audience. But times have changed. Today's Hollywood director knows that to get people into the theaters you've got to make sure that women's issues and interests are addressed.Not that there's anything wrong with that! (A quote from Seinfeld in a different context, that you might recall.) But imagine how diluted and unfocused Das Boot would have been had Petersen spent half an hour delineating each of the crew's fraus and frauleins. However, some of the work was worth the effort. The relationship between Irene and Bugsy (Rusty Schwimmer and John Hawkes, both doing a good job) was different and compelling I wish it was night so I could say, Goodnight, Irene. He speaks true corn. There'll be a time for that she rejoins, to the point and suggestively. (I'm paraphrasing from memory.) But the relationship between male and female fishboat captains (George Clooney and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) never got off the ground, and I yawned through the all too familiar quandary of young lovers, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.Anyway, at last we are out the harbor and onto the fishing grounds. I was hoping for some real authentic, little known color about long-line fishermen, and I got some the storage cells where the fish are packed with ice, the lines going out baited, the shark on deck, still biting...but that was about it. I was also hoping for some fisherman point of view on the world-wide controversy about over fishing and the Tragedy of the Commons, but all we get is that they're not making as much money as they would like, and the boat's owner gets more than seems fair.Okay, so let's see the storm. And we do and it's a monster, with massive waves throwing people all over the place threatening to swallow up the little fishing boat. Best action shot the wave blasting the cargo containers off the deck like toys (actually they were toys). But I kept thinking, who really knows what it was like on that boat in the middle of that storm? The boat flips over and flips upright and then flips again. Nobody knows who tried to get out and who didn't. And were the lights still on? I would think it would get pitch black at night under the water. What I'm saying is, the cheap cutouts used for some of the water scenes in Das Boot were more effective than the millions spent on special effects for The Perfect Storm. At least in the former we knew they were merely simulations. Here the attempt at realism underscores the fact that I'm watching a movie. Oh, and the musical score not only intrusive, but unnecessarily directive in the sense that it's telling me how I should feel about what I'm watching.Bottom line This is just interesting enough to keep a drowsy couple awake on a Sunday night, but be forewarned. The kids will want to stay up and see the storm.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)

Knowing what happen is why I avoided this movie in the theaters even though I figured, Any movie in which George Clooney dies can't be all bad.  Of course, that's before Clooney redeemed himself in my eyes with Three Kings and O Brother, Where art Thou.

Wolfgang Petersen is the perfect choice to make a movie about doomed men on a doomed boat, as anyone who saw Das Boot can testify.  Diane Lane is a standout among a very talented cast.

Our protagonists, played by Clooney and Wahlberg are brave, but not over-bright. Clooney, as captain, despite many years' experience, decides to head into the storm to save his catch. He actually has enough fuel to outrun the storm and make it, with a tail wind, catch and all, to Iceland. I'm sure the authorities in Reykjavik would not have been too upset about the lack of passports once they had satisfied themselves the fish had not been caught in their zone. Instead, with dim-witted macho bravado, he goes in the opposite direction back home to Maine. Despite the rail-grabbing drama the result is inevitable. This rather spoils the drama, and the intercut scenes with other rescues and events ashore often seem redundant.Still, you've got to give the special effects people their due. Most of the time the storm scenes were very realistic indeed, though the huge container ship losing its cargo didn't quite jell. I think we have a bit of a culture clash here - as if the producers were trying to make an action spectacular and the director, Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot)was trying to make a sincere tribute to the simple fisherfolk.

The plot is so formulaic that the characters look like the pre-production  cartoon cut-outs that never got cgi-animated. Frankly, even counting some really bad erotic flicks on the Cinemax I never saw such a generic cast of characters... Hell, they didn't even have a single bad guy in the entire movie, everybody's good inside - which the director gets out of his way to impress on the unweary within 15 seconds you first meet them. The one-liners are soo bad they would make Disney's Alladin look subtle and sophisticated. The special effects... well, if you like big waves there is about 15 minutes of footage that'll make you happy. The first half of the movie barely drags through a set of relationships, that are bland, predictable, and did I say - formulaic? See, these two guys are at each other throats on the land - I wonder what happens if one of them goes overboard?

The first 45 minutes are a ham-handed attempt at getting us to care about the characters, but the dialogue is so generic and the characters so hackneyed that the attempt is laughable.  We are not shown real people, we are *told* what to think. Then we are taken to sea, where we are introduced to some random other characters (in a sailboat, and a helicopter) who are also in trouble.  But who cares? I don't care about the main characters, much less these completely random unknowns.  The special effects are decent, but even in the storm the writing and acting are wretched.  The sailors are stupid and incompetent, and even though they are continually on the edge of death, they have little cheering/bonding sessions every time they fish one another out of the drink. The ending of the movie is embarassingly maudlin, pumping (and pumping, and pumping) for tears after cheating us of any real human beings to care about.To top it off, the musical score is intrusive and, like the rest of the flick, ham-handed and manipulative.  Strings swell every time somebody so much as twitches, until the audience is numb.I was insulted by this movie, and I'm insulted that audiences no longer have the capacity to be outraged when they are pandered to and their intelligence is repeatedly insulted.  Screw special effects -- give me one, just one character that resembles a real human being and not a paper-thin idea in some hack scriptwriter's mind.

As a sincere but superficial tribute to all Gloucester, Massachusetts' fishermen that have perished in the sea, The Perfect Storm stirs up more tear-jerking, soap operatic sentimentality than it does meteorological menace. Despite its briny documentary realism, an ensemble cast of ship-shape stars, and a seaworthy raft of Industrial Light & Magic computer generated special effects, this Warner Brothers release about men against the sea charts too many courses, contains too many irrelevant characters that win minimal sympathy, and gives its monstrous gale-force weather systems the short shrift.Imagine a soggy synthesis of John Sturges' The Old Man and the Sea, Ronald Neame's The Poseidon Adventure, and the Yul Brynner air/sea rescue epic Flight from Ashiya, and you have the basics of Bill (Legends of the Fall) Wittliff's improbable, uneven, and convoluted screenplay. First, based as it is on an actual event, Storm tries to cover two stories at once but does justice to neither one. Director Wolfgang Petersen cross-cuts erratically between the swordboat fishermen and a pleasure craft cruising sailboat captain with two female mates. Second, Petersen and Wittliff concern themselves with a far larger number of characters than they can develop beyond the usual stereotypes. Indeed, while they go to outlandish lengths to flesh out and humanize the fishermen, the filmmakers neglect to sketch in details about either the sailboat characters or the Air National Guardsman helicopter crew. Finally, despite its title, The Perfect Storm emerges as far from perfect. Petersen and Wittliff wring little more than a splash of suspense from the inclement weather in this waterlogged maritime melodrama. The scenes featuring a New England weatherman who rhapsodizes about 'the storm of a lifetime' could have been left on the cutting room floor as could the parallel story about the sailboat survivors. Undeniably, the characters attain greater significance than the raging storm that engulfs them. Clearly, Petersen and Wittliff found it easier to dramatize the more tangible human elements rather than the intangible weather phenomenon that Junger described with a bounty of scientific detail.Initially, Storm focuses on New England fishermen, principally Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney of Three Kings) and the ragtag crew of the Andrea Gail, a 72-foot swordfishing boat. This salty saga unfolds in the fall of 1991 after Tyne has just gotten back from fishing on the Grand Banks with a less than spectacular haul of swordfish. Inexplicably, unlike fellow fisherman Captain Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio of The Abyss), Billy cannot seem to find the fish. Tyne's run of bad luck irks his crew, especially rookie sailor Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg of Shooter) and veteran angler Murph (John C. Reilly of Magnolia) who had counted on fatter paychecks. Bobby wants to marry his divorced girlfriend, Christina Cotter (Diane Lane of Untraceable), but they are financially strapped and need every cent so they can move out of their room at a local wharf-side tavern into a place of their own. Meanwhile, Murph has just divorced his wife, and she is relying on his checks, too. The greedy owner of the Andrea Gail, Bob Brown (the ever cynical Michael Ironsides of Starship Troopers), warns Tyne that if his luck doesn't improve, Brown will make him walk the plank. If there were ever a Blue Collar version of Captains Courageous, The Perfect Storm is it! Tyne chaffs because Greenlaw has caught twice as much swordfish. The issue of catching enough fish to make it worthwhile for his crew to ship out with him obsesses Tyne. Moreover, Billy fears that his professional reputation has been harpooned, and he feels compelled to deliver no matter what the cost or the consequences. All the guys in Storm tangle with too much testosterone and wind up acting like mini-minded morons.Against Greenlaw's better advice as well as one of his crew who refuses to weigh anchor with him again, the guilt-ridden but reckless Tyne launches one last voyage to make up for their minuscule catch. Bobby, Murph, Bugsy (John Hawkes), and Jamaican ladies' man Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne) sign on for one more trip. Tyne replaces his missing crew member with David 'Sully' Sullivan (William Fichtner of Armageddon), then learns that Murph and Sully hate each other. Nevertheless, although he has picked a dangerous time of the year with the threat of hurricanes looming on the horizon, Tyne plans to ply the far-off but fabled waters of the Flemish Cap where he claims they will find the catch that will 'set the market.' Meanwhile, vigilant Boston TV weatherman Todd Gross (Christopher MacDonald of The Skulls) tracks three storms about to converge offshore in 'the storm of the century.' Before our heroes cast off, Petersen and Wittliff foreshadow the dire straits that lie ahead for them. All the women, from Bobby's mom to Captain Greenlaw, behave like the mythical Cassandra. Bobby's mom warns that The Grand Banks are no joke in October. Comparably, Christina begs her boyfriend, Don't go, Bobby. I got a bad feelin'. While Petersen treads water in familiar territory, he achieves none of the success that highlighted his U-boat classic Das Boot. The action occurs either on the turbulent high seas or in the calm harbor. Interestingly, Storm and Boot start similarly as the mariners return to port and indulge in a subsequent drunken binge. Effectively, Petersen steeps audiences in the environment and the economics of the Gloucester fishermen and the ominous sense of dread that hovers over the townspeople when Tyne and his crew head out to sea. Ultimately, instead of a death-defying melodrama of men against the sea, The Perfect Storm turns into a moribund memorial service that leaves you with a sinking feeling.

Then they head home straight into the perfect storm because they're too short on cash and too revved up on testosterone to heed the weather reports. Most of the rest of the film is johnny-on- the-spot there with them in the storm. But once in a while the story cuts to a sailboat in a storm near Bermuda whose captain has decided to pay no attention to the weather reports. And we're supposed to care about all these idiots. Meanwhile the entire Coast Guard and Air Reserve inexplicably seem to have only one helicopter to try to rescue everyone no matter how big the Atlantic Ocean is and how far apart these idiot-laden boats are. Even if you have a satisfactory knowledge of geography and can picture Bermuda, you have no idea where that darn Flemish Cap is in relation to Canada, Greenland, Iceland, England, the Azores, until you get home and study an atlas. I walked into the theater expecting a meteorology movie, like Twister,  but The Perfect Storm teaches nothing about meteorology. All we get is a few seconds of a TV weather guy drooling over his computer screen and naming this double hurricane the perfect storm. So then I decided this must be a disaster movie, like The Poseidon Adventure, but the fisherman protagonists are too unlikeable. Also, we get no clue how rescue efforts are coordinated, and the scenes about a sailboat near Bermuda don't fit. The movie is based on a book about real people who died in a real storm. If this isn't a meteorology movie and it isn't a disaster movie, perhaps the purpose of the movie is to show the stories of real people who died in a real storm. Perhaps I would have appreciated the movie if I had read the book. But I haven't read the book, and the movie really doesn't stand on its own. I -- and the rest of the audience -- walked out of the theater at the end with blank expressions on our faces. I didn't care one whit who died in this movie and who didn't, even if they were once upon a time real people. The movie failed to make me care. I'll say a two good things about this movie. 1) It's exciting. You never know what's going to whack, snare, or drown the individual characters at any given moment. And you get to watch good sized boats roll like kayaks! 2) You learn about the swordfish industry.

Junger's guesswork is good, and forms only part of the story of the book. This movie, however, storms into the gap by taking characters based on real people and turning them into stereo type. I knew something was amiss when I was listening to the dialogue spouting from the mouths of Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney towards the end of the movie and the thought occurred to me that no Gloucester Fisherman would talk like that in that situation. The Andrea Gail section of this movie, which is about 70% of the movie seems contrived, artificial, fake, it's very Hollywood - stoic heroic dying fisherman, stoic wives and girlfriends (tragic heroines) awaiting them at home, and evil fishing boat owner who drove his men to a suicide mission. As usual, reality is much more interesting, and subtle. I'm not saying this story would not make a fascinating, gripping, and ultimately tragic movie. But the producers and writers have taken a host of unknowns and filled in the blanks with details that ring completely false.That said, the best part and most thrilling part of the movie (and the part that rings most true) is the Coast Guard rescue scene of the downed Air Force Rescue Helicopter and the small private boat. This scene is so terrifying because it is based on eyewitness accounts and the producers decided to hew closely to the actual events (which indicates to me the good intent of the producers, despite the botched job).The CGI is serviceable but not great. It gives a sense of scale, but does not fool the eye. At the same time, when will a film crew ever be able to film 100 foot seas?This movie was disappointing but well intentioned.

One of the other commenters said not to watch this for entertainment or if you can't take a lot of stress; it is also a fun movie, but overall they were right.Everything was put into making this as real as it possibly could be, and considering that it's hard even for meteorologists to believe that the Hallowe'en Noreaster had 100-foot waves out there in the vicinity of the Andrea Gail (it more than likely did, based on interpretation of measurements taken by a buoy not too far from the spot where she went down), it is absolutely mind-boggling that the film makers re-created this so well.I have read written accounts of big boats surfing down huge waves, and of attempted sea rescues that are difficult because the sea is so rough that sometimes the person in trouble is high up above the rescue ship and and, the next second, is far, far below it (note the difference in usage between boat and ship there, referring to sizes respectively, of the Andrea Gail and the Coast Guard vessel). The X, Y, and Z axes are just going all over the place out there when the sea gets really bad.You will see all that and more in The Perfect Storm, just as it must happened in real life. One can't say that too often about movies. There are just no words to describe the experience. It is exhilarating and draining at the same time. It helps that the director has built in some quiet moments (where it definitely wouldn't have been too quiet in real life) to give the audience a break, but generally you get as hyped up at the edge of your seat as Clooney and Marky Mark are in the bridge of the Andrea Gail or as the Coast Guard would-be rescuers are, first in the aircraft and then at their ship's rail, as that whole thing plays out for them.It's fun, but not in the way that an amusement park ride is. Once it's over and the adrenaline drains away, a bit of an aversion/reaction to the intensity of it all sets in. But that's later on, after the movie is over. While you're still in the movie, you have to watch all these people you have been introduced to and grown to care about in the ultimate moments leading up to their deaths, right at the point where they realize they are going to die.That's hard, but we are also given the chance to see what a real captain does in a situation like that, and the last moments of Marky Mark/Bobby are so scary and yet fine. There is still hope...no, not really, but there is still love. That's confirmed at the very end of the film story, and it's a good way to close. The last part of the film is a silent tribute to the **ten thousand** Gloucestermen who have been lost to the sea since the 1600s.A favorite scene The whole Michael/Irene subplot.

Most movie makers just slap a satellite image in there for everything, but in The Perfect Storm they only do this where it would have been real when the meteorologist has pulled up the latest satellite images on his computer.This is a good example of the attention to detail they took to make this real. It was a success financially and it won some awards, though I'm surprised it didn't win more.

The monotonous dialog of the fishermen reminded me of Forrest Gump and his friend droning on about shrimp boat fishing. What director Wolfgang Peterson was trying to do here is puzzling. The story of the peril and possible tragic loss of several people should touch the emotions, but he has made it slower than a middle school science class documentary, and given the audience no involvement whatsoever in what is transpiring.If you're interested in the story of what happened to the Andrea Gail and her crew, read the book instead.

I was definitely hoping for it actually, and felt I got nowhere near what it was worth. While it's incredible that people really do choose professions that involve this kind of extremity, the people in this movie would have had not the depth to endeavor anything outside of the tides of the Hollywood box office. Not that Clooney didn't do a good job. He was alright, all the characters were okay, but come on. Character development can be more than wild cheering after the action hits. It had moments, they were it's own too, I supposed. All in all I was sitting and thinking that so many of these happenings were pretty unlikely and in the meantime watching the characters flicker back and forth; occasionally being distracted by the imagination surrounding the action of the sea and thinking of how amazing it would be to have real experiences like that. And it would be. Also the fish cruelty I didn't really care for.

Was the director unable to get his point across with hammering it home endlessly with an overdone soundtrack?

His screenplay, despite a promising start, rapidly looses focus and direction until the storm becomes the lead character and the actors relegated to mere extras. Though a tradition of disaster movies, the decision to focus on several individuals rather than a central protagonist is a fatal error, not least because NONE of those characters are developed in any meaningful way and given anything approaching an identity. All we are left with are generic fisherman, generic coastguard, and a generic yacht crew in peril, and we care little for any of them or their fate beyond the superficial empathy created by a competent director and melodramatic score. The viewer is left with an immediate feeling of that's sad, but has forgotten the movie and its characters before the DVD is back in its case.ILM do a very nice job of recreating the converging hurricanes, and the artistic and technical teams in general are excellent. But as is so often the case, a beautifully executed movie cannot compensate for a poorly structured screenplay populated by shallow characters.

Unfortunately I don't think I became emotional in the way Wolfgang Peterson quite intended. No, I felt not sadness when watching this film. The emotions I experienced were feelings of amusement, occasional boredom (if you can call that an emotion) and intense rage.Before I slag this film off too much I should point out that I did find it entertaining in parts. But I don't think this was intentional.Now, I only saw this on TV, so maybe the effects were a little lost, but for the most part you could tell it was CGI. I'm surprised this film won prizes for its effects - maybe 2000 was a bad year. The second problem with the effects was when people fell in the water in the middle of the biggest hurricane in recorded history, they seemed to float in a fairly steady position, almost like they were standing on the bottom of a swimming pool. This leads me to make my second criticism.This film was, in parts, unrealistic. I find this a large problem since it's based on a true story. Why, every time the guys went fishing, did they all start cheering. There was even a bit when they were packing swordfish in ice in an overenthusiastic manner.I stayed up late and watched this film for 2hrs 30mins, expecting something, somewhere to have a consequence or payoff of some kind. Instead, everyone dies at the end. If I'd known that was going to happen, I wouldn't have bothered watching the preceding 2hrs 20mins.Overall I felt this was a typically cheesy piece of Hollywood claptrap, which exploited a real life tragedy in order to make a special effects blockbuster movie. Insensitive, exploitative, inept, impotent, nonsense.

I cannot say any more without being a spoiler - but this a movie that spoils itself unless you never read newspapers or, in this case, even look out of the window!My hat goes out to people that go out in boats risking life-and-limb to bring me my dinner, but I reflected and acknowledged this before this film. However if you go out on a boat to catch fish you have already acknowledged a risk - you cannot say, when out at sea, no lets head home it is a bit dangerous! You made a decision when you set out or even decided to be a fisherman in the first place!The negative is that the film has nothing to offer beyond buckets-of-water-in-the-face special effects. I mean nothing.All they can do is alternate between worried landlubbers and those struggling for their very lives - there is no script writer on earth that can make that in to great drama. To make it worse it spins this cycle out to great length - repeating itself over and over again until you want a mercy killing!(By the end of the first hour I wanted to turn Jewish and shout enough - already!)The Wahlberg/Clooney relationship is one of master and servant and is - therefore - a working relationship of unequals. They sometimes have a common cause - but that is all they have, despite it being the central plank of the movie!All the producers have proven is that there isn't a movie to be made about a storm at sea - perfect or not.

First off, I'd like to say that anyone dumb enough to think that they can head directly into a hurricane on a small fishing boat and make it through unscathed, and just for some money, is entirely stupid and would probably succumb to the survival of the fittest theory sometime shortly thereafter if the storm did not kill them. People that attempt such things usually don't live too long. I guess some of my dislike for this film comes from my dislike of the real heroes, I think they're stupid, with all due respect. But, I have to admit, maybe some of this dislike has been projected onto them unfairly and my opinion might be tarnished by this raw and pure definition of trite cinema. I rejoiced when they met their fate.trite 1. Lacking power to evoke interest through overuse or repetition; hackneyed. 2. Frayed or worn out by use. And there you have it. There never was much of a story to begin with, some fools died on a boat, but no one really knows the details....so the filmmakers were forced to pull the rest out of their rears. Too bad they didn't look to see if it didn't stink first. Everything in this film from the characters, the minor conflicts, the dialogue...it's all been done about three billion time before in three billion other movies. And where it gets bad is where you can tell even the creators knew that they didn't have much of a story to go on and decided to throw some weak conflicts here and there to keep the audience from falling asleep. A shark on board, oh no! Man overboard, oh no! The conflict onboard that is resolved after one of the guys saves his enemy, aww, how cute and totally original. The lovesick lovers left behind, awww, how sad. The moronicly stubborn captain and the men who mindlessly worship him, hmmm haven't seen that before. I got sick of hearing Skip being said after about the hundredth time...almost as if they were in the military and addressing a superior as Sir. And the captain that can't bear to leave his boat, idiot. Another thing that's gay is how excitable the crew is. They catch some fish and it's as if they won the biggest lottery jackpot of all time. It's silly. The acting itself isn't too terrible, there just was never much to work with. The whole thing isn't helped by simply the gayest ending of all time. 'I have this dream&#133;'The only good thing about this film is the special effects of the storm itself, which are mildly amusing. Other than that, this is a MST 3000 candidate for sure. As a matter of fact, I watched this film with the sole intention of ripping it while watching it, which was amazingly easy to do. It almost does it to itself. What it all culminates into is a below average, over-budgeted summer blockbuster and nothing more.

The local theater manager predicted it would be the big hit of 2000. He, of course, was right. Two years later, I have finally gotten to see the video and can understand the film's success.MANY SPOILERS AHEADI really DON'T want to spoil the end for anyone who doesn't know, since for once, no one spoiled it for ME! I wasn't sure how it would come out and the outcome is quite masterfully crafted - as the dramatic movie poster shot actually takes place in the climactic scene.`The Perfect Storm' rolls drama, action, romance and some good New England flavor into a cohesive, fast-moving package. The cast is extremely strong, from George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg as Captain Billy Tyne and Bobby Shatford respectively, to the extras in the bar.Based on the true story of the `Andrea Gail,' a Glouchester, Mass. swordfishing boat, lost in a torrential 1991 storm (which I did not know until after seeing the film), the movie brings home the mortal peril in which mariners toil year-round and the fear and heartache experienced by their loved ones back on land.The story centers around the crusty Tyne, a veteran fishing captain who has run into a long string of bad luck and poor outings, and his young charge, Shatford. Pressured by the boat's owner to start bringing in paying catches, Tyne decides to take the Andrea Gail out for one final late fall trip. He talks most of his regular crew to go, plus out-of-work acquaintance David `Sully' Sullivan (William Fichtner). The rest of the crew is comprised of Dale `Murph' Murphy (John C. Reilly), Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne) and Michael `Bugsy' Moran (John Hawkes).Someone with knowledge of commercial fishing would certainly connect on levels the average viewer cannot. Much time is spent, running around deck, throwing various things in the water and doing other things that are never explained. Many scenes also take place in such darkness that it is very difficult to get any idea of what is going on and which characters are in peril. Still, we get a good feel for what it must be like to be out on a small craft, for an extended fishing expedition.Shortly after the Andrea Gail sails, though, ominous weather information begins coming into Channel 9 in Boston. As the movie progresses, the TV meteorologist (Christopher McDonald) predicts the collision of three massive storms off of New England - `the perfect storm.' Tyne's friend and fellow captain, Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastratonio) tries to warn Tyne and his crew. A snapped radio antennae, however, keeps the Andrea Gail from receiving clear messages. Soon the FAX is knocked out, too, leaving Tyne to proclaim `We're in the 19th century!'Even before the storm hits the fishing boat, a yacht with a middle aged fool and two young women - no hint is ever given as to who they are and what they're up to, other than `heading straight to Bermuda' - fall victim to the storm and must be rescued by a naval rescue squad. Much film time is burned on the rescue crew, which needs rescuing itself, after the copter is unable to fuel with a tanker airplane and must ditch. It provides filler between scenes on the Andrea Gail, but is more confusing and annoying than entertaining.The movie has something for everyone. The old tag line `Movies for men who like movies' jumps out at me as I picture Tyne and Shatford on the bridge, faces aglow with exaltation during lighting flashes, as they ride out the huge waves in Errol Flynn style.  It could qualify as a `chick flick,' too, though, as Diane Lane plays Wahlbert's love interest, Christina Cotter, who tries to convince him to abandon fishing for a safer occupation on shore. Her New England accent is perfect and she and Ethel Shatford (Janet Wright) make a strong domestic connection. It isn't really clear, watching the movie, whether Ethel merely considers Bobby a son (as she does Billy and others) or if he really IS her son. Since she is listed as Ethel Shatford in the credits, that seems to answer this question! Irene (Rusty Schwimmer) and Hawkes make an intriguing if unattractive potential couple; one wishes they had had more screen time together.In the end, melodrama takes over, with a tear-jerker ending. Then again, the movie was based on a real-life tragedy in which six men drowned and several families were left to pick up the pieces. It certainly captures the cold heartlessness of the sea and the frailty of human life.Altogether, I would rate it as high as any film I have seen in the 2000's - albeit that isn't a great amount, yet. `The Perfect Storm' is good entertainment and it being based on a real situation adds a strong touch of poignancy to the ending. I would strongly recommend it.

Even my sentimental wife, whose favorite movie is Sound of Music, was laughing at the overly dramatic set-ups of the movie's characters before they took their fateful trip. She actually started spouting cliched dialog in a few scenes. dialogue that was more or less what the characters then said. And we both mocked the movie's theme music, which was the same 6-7 notes played over and over and over and over, as often as possible.Perfect Storm hits you over the head (then smashes you in the stomach, then knees you in the groin) with the thought that being a swordfish captain/crew is in your blood ... a poetic existence ... being at one with yourself and the sea. It essentially ignores any common sense on behalf of the characters and also overlooks the fact that this is a group of people who seem to have made one bad decision after another in their lives and who are doomed to be sitting penniless, toothless and alone at the local crappy bar as they age and die at age 52. There were almost NO redeeming characteristics in this group of seamen, and they sure as heck weren't very smart.So, when the storm hits, do you care what happens? Not really. We kept thinking about the *real* men who died, and what they went through, and we felt bad for them. But these doofuses in the movie were just asking for it.The one group of characters who were easier to empathize with were the rescue crews. Those scenes dew the viewer in and served to make you appreciate brave people who do very tough jobs. It also made you even more annoyed at the sword boat crew that put the rescuers in the difficult position they were in.Finally, the much ballyhooed special effects were basically limited to shots of big waves in the background, and, finally, the shot we all saw in the trailer and commercials where the ship hits the monster wave. Very little variety, very little of interest once you get used to the waves.I can't believe this was a popular movie.

It's a dangerous job, but one they love, and most of them go because they can make a lot of money on one trip if the conditions are right and they catch enough fish. We get to know the characters, Billy Tyne, the captain who is outfished by fellow woman swordboat captain, Linda Greenlaw, and is a little sensitive about it. There's Bobby Shatford the rookie fisherman and his girlfriend Christina Cotter who are trying to make a new start. Bobby wants to take one more trip out to pay off his divorce lawyer and his debts. Bugsy (Michael) Moran who only wants a woman to love him, who tries to pick up Irene, a single mother in the bar.  She doesn't leave with him that night, but sees him off when the boat goes out.

Sully and Murph don't like each other.The guys leave Gloucester on a foggy morning in early October for the Grand Banks, catch a few swordfish, and then nothing.  Things happen, accidents, a shark, and a rogue wave, and then the men start getting restless,and want to go home.  The Captain says No, we're going to the Flemish Cap.  They catch a lot of fish there,fill the fish hold, but then the ice machine dies. To complicate matters a big storm (2 storm fronts colliding with a hurricane) is right in their path going home.  They're faced with either waiting it out and losing their big catch, or going home through this big storm.  Most of them are experienced fishermen who have been through bad storms before, and they're so tired at this point that they decide, to plow through the storm anyway not knowing how bad it will get.  The special effects are awesome. It gets VERY wet and windy out there and you wonder how the boat can keep afloat.  There's a great sense of loyalty and heroics among the men.

The crew includes young and newly in love Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), devoted and recently divorced father Dale 'Murph' Murphy (John C.

They aren't catching much, so Billy is taking a risk heading east, ignoring storm warnings, and it seems they catch a mother load. Unfortunately the ice machine fails, and they have to decide whether to wait for a huge storm to pass, or risk their lives and go through it, and of course, they want the money, so decide to go through one of the biggest killer storms in recorded history. Also in the North Atlantic waters are fellow sailors Christina Cotter (Untraceable's Diane Lane), Melissa Brown (Karen Allen) and Alexander McAnally III (Bob Gunton), who are luckily rescued by the near air freight helicopter, but they unfortunately cannot reach the Andrea Gail for fear of running out of fuel. In the end, you expect one of the crew members to survive that final skyscraper size wave, living to tell the tale, but none are ever seen again.

It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Sound. Worth watching!

The crew needs to get successful, so they don't turn back despite a ridiculously out of the ordinary storm in the ocean. The film is well-crafted as films of this sort are Peterson's bread and butter. Clooney and Wahlberg both check in for good performances, while Reilly and Lane were also not bad in their roles. Overall a quality film, that is not entirely exciting and action- paced, however still interesting throughout. I enjoyed this 00' film from Peterson. --- 9/10 "},{"Title":"One of the worst","Date":"14 August 2007","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" I read lots of these comments and am stunned at the gullibility of the general public. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen with the audience being asked to accept impossible situations, cliché characters, an appalling musak score and 2 hours of boredom in a bathtub. There is no way, for example, that people on a boat could walk around on deck in some of the effects-waves we were asked to watch, and no way a helicopter could stay aloft in winds we were asked to accept. God knows what George Clooney was doing in this dog - maybe had a contractual obligation or somesuch. This movie is an example of the power of mass marketing and is without value except at the box office. The only redeeming feature is that it didn't run to 3 hrs. I watched, fascinated by it's dreadful dreariness right to the clichéd end, thinking of what the $120M cost MIGHT have produced.

Having read the book and seen the movie a few years back, it seemed to grab me again this time. And not for the original reasons.This viewing almost came as a surprise-a prophecy.Consider the characters...mostly a gathering of desperate people doomed to their eventual demise because of the real life pathos for money. Some just need to stay ahead of the creditors. Some need to stay abreast of somebody's vile opinion of them (i.e. George Clooney). Others might just seem caught up in the need to succeed...despite apparent warnings.The storms themselves are a backdrop to a sinister mega plot of an unseen entity (or Deity). What we have here is the prescription for self destruction which drive so many of us to make toxic choices in our personal lives. And all such choices usually result in battle damage to so many we encounter in our all too brief stay on this planet.The world as were view it today is a brewing storm and it will consume those who chose unwisely. This especially includes those in position of authority ( political, judicial, legislative and clergy) to list but a few. Not to heed warnings and NOT to respect the very planet that was given to us eons past is a major blunder...and many will be caught up in this other PERFECT STORM.

I would have thought that George Clooney being such a great actor would have made this a good film, it had the potential to be great. This was incredibly depressing and showed no truth. I was also astounded that the strength of humankind was shown so badly- surely if you were in that sort of situation, you would pull together better than that? It is such a bad interpretation that I was really tempted to turn it off half way through. I think the only bit in the whole film that was even the slightest bit good, was when Billy was saying that poem to his wife- though how she heard him I will never know. All in all a pretty terrible film, that makes you so depressed you could cry.

The only way I could have enjoyed this movie less would have been if the characters had lived.  It's a terrific concept take a bunch of jerks, throw them on a boat, and watch them act dumb and die.  Sorry, spoiler.  Too late.  You'll thank me later for saving you the trouble of sitting through it.  Annoying acting, the worst script ever, the worst child actor ever, stupid-looking fish being mutilated, and the excitement of water.  You could go on a log flume ride at Six Flags and have 79238749238472389 times as much fun.The inadequacies of my native tongue prevent me from truly expressing the extent of my hatred for this thing that sucks too much to deserve a noun that describes it and it only.  I would not deign to call it crap, because I don't want to hurt the feelings of the makers of other films (such as Mannequin 2) that are clearly crap but in no way as bad as this.  Not even John C. Reilly and William Fichtner can save it.  In fact, they do their best to ensure that it sucks worse than almost anything ever has, right along with everyone else involved.Without question it's extremely unfortunate that people actually died in this horrible storm, but at least now they don't have to sit through this. What a miserable, insulting epitaph.

If you have to see Clooney, go get your old ER tape out of the back of the bookshelf.  We even saw it on DVD and the special effects were not nearly as projected by the advertisements.

I re-read the novel recently and thought I should watch the movie. I couldn't. From the cloying, saccharin sweet musical score to the wretched acting/direction this whole thing is a disaster movie in every sense of the word. If you enjoyed the novel take my advice under no circumstances rent this and attempt to watch it.

The special effects are fine, but too much stormy weather and the end is flat and out of line with the rest of the movie.Basically I think that describing a fishing boat in rough weather is a good idea - but for getting some real depths into such a complicated issue directors such as Lars Von Trier or Quentin Tarantino would probably have been better bets.It comes down to being a relatively boring movie (in spite of the impressive special effects) with rather uninteresting character-conflicts, and you never really feel that the movie starts...If the director had solely focused on stormy weather and left out the uninteresting human conflicts it would have stood out as more honest. Too much was told and too little made an impact.But an OK main-stream catastrophe-movie - the mistake just being that they tried to make it into something a bit more than that. It ain't.

I was going to blame the studio for making a film unapologetically commercial with its marketable pop song soundtrack , and its hunky male stars cast to appeal to a female audience along with tedious sub plots featuring wives and children , but seeing as  Wolfgang Petersen also receives a producer`s credit maybe he deserves most of the blame , certainly as director he`s responsible for far too many talkative scenes along with irritating intrusive incidental music , something which also spoiled OUTBREAK . In fact I get the impression Petersen caters far too much towards commercial doctrines in all his American films Wolfgang Petersen gave us DAS BOOT one of the greatest films Europe has ever produced and I don`t think that was a fluke on Petersen`s part . He can make movies involving heart stopping tension and human drama but I think he has a certain misinterpretation how obsessed the Hollywood studio system is with spectacle , star names , sentimentality and special effects . It`s true to a certain degree that`s what Hollywood movies are about , but hopefully one day very soon a prime Hollywood player will tell Petersen he can make a film he wants to make , not one he thinks a  Hollywood studio wants to make  "}]
