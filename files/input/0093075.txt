It features goofy heavy metal music and demons. Stephen Dorff plays young Glen, who discovers a hole in his backyard is a doorway for demons. After his friend Terry plays his metal album backwords and they coincidently bury the family pet(you always need a sacrifice) in a hole in the backyard, they awaken demonic spirits which destroy the home and try to kill them. A funny take(even if not meant to be) on back masking and the influence of rock music on children. This film features some classic stop motion in the lines of Jason and the Argonauts. They are attacked by reanimating dead, droves of tiny demons and a head demon the size of a bus, which bares a strong resemblance to a Clash of Titans creature. This all stemming from a movie that would normally be a dud given the time period. It shouldn't be taken too seriously, but will amuse you for about 85 minutes. This is yet another underrated, hardly seen eighties gem.

Yeah, ads that included those little dwarfed demons with mean faces and sharp teeth. Hey, for 1987 that was seriously cool - and done very well! But at the time, I came out of the theater thinking, Eh, it was okay. Years later, sick and not in the mood to move, I flipped through the channels late at night and found The Gate about to come on. I thought, Eh, for nostalgia, why not? I was surprised by how much I loved the movie! I'd forgotten it starred Stephen Dorff (he was unknown back then), and I was disappointed to learn that his sister in the movie (Christa Denton) didn't really go on to do much else. She was cute. Whatever happened to her??? Besides the cool suburban and 1980's atmosphere (not to mention the clothes and hair - oh yeah!), the movie's story is the fun type of cheese that still keeps your eyes glued to the TV. Cool effects, a no-brainer but engaging story, and the kids are fun to watch. It's also on DVD at a cheap price, and I bought it the other day. Not bad.

I expected one of those God-awful, cheesy special effects, mindless eighties horror films - a decade I think was a low ebb for that genre in general. I got to see a 35mm print of The Gate and was impressed with several things. Now before I get out of control here, make no mistake, this is not a great film even in terms of the horror genre, but it is a bona-fide campy, cult favorite from the eighties with good reason. The story is ridiculous about some hole, as a result of an old tree being destroyed in a family's backyard, having demons living down deep in its bowels. A rock band that died tragically also is involved, or at least the record album on hand complete with a huge history of demonology attached. Add a couple more-than-precocious boys, a bunch of teens, looking dreadfully eighties-style, attending a party while the parents are away, and some freaky little demons and you have much of The Gate. The little demons are cute and spooky and the director Tibot Takics actually visualizes them rather nicely - particularly in an era when special effects for horror and science fiction films were quite low in terms of quality. The director was also able to create some suspense and some interesting characters with the 2 small boys in particular. Stephen Dorff and Louis Tripp play Glenn and Terry respectively and give the film some heart. There is not much to recommend as far as the remaining cast is concerned, but The Gate delivers some solid scares, some atmospheric settings and direction, and some surprisingly good special effects.

I knew horror was big then, but big enough to make a movie for the under eighteen? I was definitely going to have to watch The Gate.This fun, campy horror flick is about Glen (Stephen Dorff) and his best friend, Terry (Louis Tripp), accidentally finding a gateway to hell in Glen's backyard, and with the help from a rock band that had written songs about the gate, try to close it up. Unfortunately, all doesn't go that well. With Glen's parents gone for the weekend and his big sister, Al (Christa Denton), in charge, this can only mean one thing demons.The downside about the demons, though? Well, actually there are two things. One, they're about the size of a newborn kitten, which sort of takes away what could have been something good and scary (though if you were about ten when watching this, it would have given you nightmares compared to anyone over thirteen.) However, considering it is a low-budget movie that does involve kids, I'm sure they couldn't make them too challenging of demons (they were actually rather stronger than you would have suspected!) The other downside is that it takes nearly fifty minutes for anything even remotely scary to happen (the very first incident is when long creature-looking arms are grabbing Al's leg from under a bed in Glen's room.) After that, the movie becomes a wonderful roller coaster ride, but then the ride slows down and before you know it, it's time to get off.When the bed scene is over we actually get a little &#x96; and I do mean just a little &#x96; gore! Now I'm not talking gore as in The Thing, but the gore was good enough for the movie and to not make anyone queasy. As far the special effects go, today they would have been considered bad, but for the era back then they're actually rather decent.

This could possibly get an R today, and is a great horror-fantasy that I loved as a kid and still love now. All of the actors turn in great performances (including a very young Stephen Dorff who proves here that he was a great actor from the start), and I have no idea how anyone could dare to criticize the quality of these great special FX. To me, The Gate is an example that sometimes a low-budget film, if done well, looks much better than big-budget swill could ever wish to be. The only less than totally impressive special effect is the big monster that shows up, but it's no better or worse than the computer-generated monsters we're accustomed to today, plus the fact that it WAS done on a low budget should make it more worthy of respect when it probably looked state-of-the-art back then. All of the rest of the creatures are great. Like in Return of the Aliens The Deadly Spawn (another great movie with even lower budget creature FX), if I were to run into some monsters in real life, I would expect them to look as real as this! Another thing I loved about this was the fact that, despite idiotic people who write all the time that this movie is making a comment against heavy metal, The Gate actually poses an interesting idea that sometimes the knowledge of some of these heavy metal rockers can be positive and helpful, no matter how evil their image might be.

If the boys don't figure out a way to close said gate right away, these lethal demonic beings will bring about hell on earth. Director Tibor Takacs and writer Michael Nankin eschew the usual graphic gore and cheap nasty scares found in a majority of 80's slasher fare that was trendy at the time in order to put a welcome and refreshing emphasis on eerie mood and nerve-jangling suspense. The gradual build-up in the opening half leads to a delightfully surreal and nightmarish second half which culminates in a lively and exciting climax. Moreover, the main characters are well developed and genuinely appealing Dorff and Tripp make for engaging leads while Christa Denton brings an endearingly spunky charm to her role as Glen's sweet older sister Al. Jennifer Irwin and Deborah Grove are amusing as the vapid Lee sisters. Nankin's screenplay boasts several cool offbeat touches Terry learns about the gate by listening to a hard rock album from an obscure band, the telephone melts, a shambling zombie workman bursts out of the walls, and Glen winds up with an eyeball in the palm of his hand. Kudos are also in order for the dazzling array of excellent and impressive special effects The giant stop-motion animation beast seen towards the end is truly gnarly while the diminutive demonic minions are quite creepy and funky. Takacs and Nankin bring a positively infectious go-for-it enthusiasm to the material that's impossible to either dislike or resist. Tomas Vanes' slick cinematography and the spirited shuddery score by Michael Hoenig and J. Peter Robinson are both up to par as well. Best of all, there's even an upbeat central message about how the power of pure love can effectively conquer evil. An incredibly fun and worthwhile 80's creature feature winner.

One of the better aspects here is the film does a rather fun job of building to the actual infestation of the demons as there's some cheesy scenes to really make this work. The hole's appearance at the very beginning and its contrived openings along with the discovery of the strange rocks starts this off rather well, and with the supernatural lights and party levitation tricks which all come along together very well. Best of all, this one manages to tie these factors into their true significance with a heavy metal record that not only gives them the final clue that something's going on but also the tactics needed to fully resolve the situation rather than what was commonly done at the time which meant being the root cause of it all simply for being loud and aggressive. This is pretty novel and unique which gives it some rather clever marks for its story that makes the resulting supernatural-themed action so fun as the effects of the gate opening weave throughout this. There's the creation of the second pit beneath the house, the abduction of their friends and the initial haunting dreams to go along with these scenes as well as the frantic finale which features everything from tiny demons crawling throughout the house to the fight against the multi-limbed monstrosity that appears at the end which provides this with plenty of rather enjoyable action-packed scenes that come off quite fun due to the supernatural bent to these scenes. Along with the rather appealing child-friendly storyline, there here are enough for this one to hold off the film's few problems that pop up in here. One of the bigger problems here is the fact that there's very little actual involvement of the main gateway towards the kids, as the main half here tends towards scenes involving them being home with their friends rather than anything of any significance against the titular gateway. The supernatural activity is kept to such a minimum that it really feels in a back-seat against the film's main point which is the teen angst drama of being unable to connect with his sister as she grows up as this particular storyline overwhelms the movie so much to the detriment the more horror-centered elements found in the second half the other flaw to this one is the absolutely banal and ridiculous special effects used for the demons here, with some really bad stop-motion photography that's jerky and obvious and just plain up-front about its origins which really tends to lower this one somewhat. Overall, these here are the film's flaws.Rated PG-13 Violence and Language.

Michael Flipper Nankin's script, centering on two tween-agers who manage to accidentally open a demonic portal to wherever, is slipshod and undistinguished--routine TV quality at best; the direction by Tibor The Outer Limits (1995) Tak√°cs is pedestrian. The Gate has all the markings of an on-the-cheap Canadian production, highlighted only by a few snippets of stop-motion animation and some forced perspective work that looks pretty good, but adds nothing in terms of actual suspense or much of anything else. On a whole, it strikes this viewer as a made-for-TV movie with a slightly higher budget, just not enough to put it on a par with genuine feature films.No, the only thing that makes The Gate stand out is the fact that it was Stephen Immortals Dorff's first film (at age 12-13), along with several of his co-stars. All the kids, in fact, came from TV-land; interestingly, the two with the choicer support roles in The Gate eventually faded from acting, while the two girls playing Alexandra's friends both went on to solid (though not brand name) careers. Such is fate and show biz. I'll also opine that Christa The Burning Bed Denton's birth year listed here on the IMDb is inaccurate; Dorff was pushing 13 when the movie was shot, so take another look at Al and do the math.The Gate is one of those films that benefits from nostalgia, and the more years between seeing it and remembering it, the better. The (apparent) impending remake stands a very good chance of being an improvement, should the powers-that-be actually cough up for a decent screenplay and a quality director. There'll be no excuse for not providing quality acting talent; Dorff and Co. established the only high bar the original provides. I won't be holding my breath, mind you, but in the meantime, if you really must re-explore your childhood film thrills, surely you have better examples than The Gate to provide them.

It is really too scary a movie for small children, but the protagonist is one. Nor does it capture the innocence of youth. More or less, Mom and Dad leave the kids home alone for the weekend with a big scary hole in the back yard. Some mildly creepy things happen. Stephen Dorf was pretty good as the precocious demon fighter. Made in the mid-80's it is visually and aurally a period piece. It is refreshingly relatively free of gore. Nightmares and the devil worship associated with heavy metal music are the horror idioms of choice. Sex and slashing are minimized.

When the two find that the hole in the ground is indeed a gateway to another dimension full of ravenous demons and bloodthirsty creatures which has been accidentally unveiled through their freak accidents, they try to close it off only to find it has been too late. With a slew of demons unleashed the day of a party, they try to put an end to the invasion before anything happens.Pretty standard fare, but for such a tame film this does build up some good suspense and scares.

But it turns out to be a much more interesting movie for a number of reasons. First, the pre-CGI special effects are pretty amazing, including, but not limited to, the intensely creepy minions which were stunning in the late eighties and remain so today. Something like a cross between little silly putty humonculi and the Zuni fetish doll from Trilogy of Terror, these things are truly the stuff of nightmares, and are seamlessly depicted throughout most of the film. So much so that at times you're not sure whether the effect is puppetry, stop motion animation, or people in rubber suits--I mean, it's clearly an effect, but that layer of how'd they do it? makes it all the more unsettling. Add to that the casting of actual teens and preteens, and then allow them to behave more or less as actual teens and preteens would under the circumstances, then augment with some really nice subtle touches (the altered family photo comes to mind, almost as an afterthought) and bring the whole thing in with very little actual gore and a low body count, and you have a pretty worthwhile, and even genre-stretching exercise. It's not high art (and it's not surprising that it's Canadian--a DeGrassi Street Poltergeist,if you will), but it is a far sight better and more original than any of the crappy big-budget horror remakes Hollywood has come up with lately. Better than expected.

Well what the hell? I probably should have seen this as a thirteen-year-old kid to get the kicks out of it. Now... I only liked the beginning. I liked the direction. The nightmare intro is effective, easy to see the director has potential! After that we've given real characters (the geeky kid's mother has been dead for a year; the main characters' parents are all right; the big sister behaves her age, both in good and bad) and introduced to the amusing premise there's a gate to hell in their back yard ) The problems ensue when movie tries to make sense and bring background info and proof to this main idea. What the hell for? It's a horror movie! No-one cares how Michael Myers survived after being shot six times in the finale of 'Halloween'! Nobody would want a 15 -minute storyline involving some Ph.D. explaining how it would be physically possible! In horror movies things like that can be dealt with within a 30 - second piece of dialogue BS rookie cop - How can it be? It's not possible! Lead character (bleeding) - It IS! Now deal with it!So The gate starts to drag after 37 minutes or so. After that we get a couple of good scares that lead to nowhere, they're there to furthermore postpone the inevitable... and then we have the incoherent scares and horror in the end. Seemingly the end consists of two 15 - minute segments that are just forced into each others. No doubt you end up asking yourself the same question I did where the hell is this going? Multiple times. Perhaps this was planned an R-rated flick with deaths, and sanitizing it to PG-13 (no blood, no deaths) made it jumpy and illogical. Or then they realized they'd only shot a 45 - minute movie and desperately just filled it up. The gate is uneven yet a watchable effort, if you're into the genre; the very good scenes make up for the not so good ones and the incoherency. Good actors, dialogue avoids the usual clich√©s, OK effects, better than usual camera - work and some of the effects still work. Basically all this needed was a coherent script.

It's possibly, quite possibly, a gateway to hell! Glen discovers a chiod..this rock with a glittery substance on the inside. Terry(Louis Tripp), a weird friend of Glen's whose mother recently died and victim of an absent father, collects several moths which came in mass from the hole and places them in a jar. Glen puts the jar in by the window for which eerie things begin to happen. Terry has this record of a band called Sacrifyx, who were students of the art of conjuring demons. They released one album, for which Terry owns, but perished in a plane crash. On a certain song, the band recite a specific chanting which pertains to the demons which rise from the hole of hell. This book accompanied the record called, The Dark Book..a guide to not only opening the doorway, but closing it as well. Alexandra(Christa Denton), Glen's sister, works her parents into letting her babysit while they are away on a three day trip. Soon after the parents leave, all hell breaks loose..literally! This is a horror title that probably should be watched by anyone in for an entertaining little ride. It's pretty much a film which utilizes bells and whistles. There are quite a few really good horror gags that work splendidly. Perhaps the most famous gag(well for me, at least)is the melting phone, but the demon effects are excellent. The director does quite well using the hole as a major device at giving the viewer the creeps. When Tripp falls into the hole, that fear of being trapped inside with demons is quite prevalent. There's a great gag concerning a dead dog as Terry envisions a reunion with his late mother. There's also a great little fright gag when supposedly Glen and Al's parents return..You've been Bad!! The way the whole last 30 minutes or so sets up is really goofy, but if you just can adjust to what the film wants to do I think you can enjoy it without getting overly prejudicial toward the coincidences and liberties taken by the filmmakers in setting up Glen's final showdown with the main demon. There are some fine moments where our young heroes must deal with those pesky little demons and, I liked how this big monstrous figment of a dead man comes to life from Terry's imagination..the demons use fear as a motivational tool and I thought it worked well. The final half of the film is pretty much a special effects extravaganza so many might roll their eyes at the final result which is perhaps a bit far fetched and stretching our limits of acceptance towards how a young boy could possibly battle a creature from hell using a bottle rocket. Still, it wants so badly to entertain you and I, without a shadow of doubt, found much enjoyment and thrills.

I'd say this is one of the best low budget films of the 80s. After an old tree collapses, friends Glen and Terry find a geode in the massive hole left behind. Trouble starts when Glen and his sister Alexandra are left alone for the weekend by their parents. Through an odd series of events, demons and Gods from the old world have been summoned through the gate in the backyard. How do they know this? Well, Terry is a metalhead who has an album by Sacrifyx (my dad picked it up in Europe) that explains it all. Despite how all that sounds, it works.Director Tibor Takacs really delivers with this one. The film touches on some interesting themes (brother and sister growing apart; parental neglect) but wins mainly due to its fast pace (it runs just 85 minutes). Takacs succeeds in delivering some real dream-like images such as a father's face melting into slime, an eyeball in Glen's hand and the urban legend dead workman in the walls who becomes real. All of this is brought to life via some amazing special effects work (courtesy of Craig Reardon and Randy Cook's teams). Cook delivers some fantastic stop motion animation. Despite being 20 years old, nearly all of the f/x work holds up today. THE GATE ended up being a surprise box office hit when released in May of 1987. So much so that the entire production crew reunited for THE GATE II, easily one of the worst follow ups ever. Takacs has worked steadily since (he even delivered MANSQUITO last year) but he has never managed to match this film.

The demonic underworld is filled with devilish little creatures about six inches high that begin to terrorize the kids. The film also includes a zombie of an apparent workman busting out of a wall of the house (in which the kids live) and eventually, a really big demon.Well, this is one of those rare horror films made for little kids. Ages 10-15 or so. And, like another little horror flick for kids (Tobe Hooper's remake of Invaders From Mars), this one exhibits a high degree of horror that one might imagine is simply too much for really young children. The upside, however, is that this film is superior to Hooper's sci-fi remake. The acting is quite a bit better and the special effects are decent. But that doesn't detract from the fact that the script is written down for a much younger audience and the atmosphere isn't all that great. Most of the effects are stop-motion animation and puppets, but the little underworld demon guys do manage to be pretty damn creepy.

While the film is not quiet as good or as fun as that one is, THE GATE certainly has it's moments to help qualify as one of the most remarkably well made horror flicks of it's era. It's a really fun popcorn horror item, that is well deserving of it's positive notices & cult status potential. Humorously enough, the film is part of many horror films made around the same time, to deal with the supposed satanic messages found in heavy metal death music, others would include TRICK OR TREAT (1986) ROCKTOBER BLOOD (1984) BLACK ROSES (1988) SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE 2 (1987) ROCK & ROLL NIGHTMARE (1989) etc. all of which centred around a rock music record, group, or lead singer that is the cause for an uncontrollable amount of heavy supernatural going on's & vicious slayings & in some cases, vicious monsters that are let loose. The stop motion animation effects by RANDALL WILLIAM COOK are some of the best to ever grace the screen of any horror film. Notable scenes is when a minion get its hand cut off, only for it to hit the floor, turn into a series of worms & then leave the house. A zombie workman falls on the floor & morphs into several minions & the Demon Lord is well done piece of work. The creature designs are well articulated & the zombie workman that shows up midway, is really spooky looking! The acting works for the most part, STEPHEN DORFF in his feature film debut brings plenty of sympathy to his character the rocket loving Glen, although it's almost hard to buy into the fact he's a thirteen year old kid, since he looks to be seven, because he's so tiny! LOUIS TRIPP (Whatever became of this guy anyways?) fares well as his pal Terry, a complete opposite of Glen, since he's more the weird/loner type, who prefers heavy metal rock music to rockets. CHRISTA DENTON fares well as Glen's older sister. TIBOR TAKAC'S fares well behind the camera, executing a series of cool shots & camera trickery, he manages to keep the film moving at a decent pace & manages to conjure up a few well executed, suspense & tension filled moments, to coincide with all the weirdness going on that this little horror gem has to offer. The score is particularly well done. The ending is also highly imaginative, as young Glen is forced to try & defeat the demon lord that emerges from the earth, using stuff from his toy box in a final confrontation with the beast. THE GATE must also set some kind of record, for being the only film to use a BARBIE doll as a weapon, to pluck out a possessed kids eye. The films weird energy is confirmed, when a made up story Terry tells Glen about a workman killed on a job that got sealed up behind one of their walls, because the rest of the workers didn't want to stop construction of Glen's house is used by the demons, bringing Terry's creepy story to life!Despite it's many hit's, THE GATE also has some misses to it's record as well. I think the main problem stems from the fact that due to the film aiming for the kiddie market, the PG-13 rating robs the film of a much creepier & darker, more violent & bloodier impact it could have had. One thing sorely missing from THE GATE is atmosphere, although the film opens up with a weird, stylish & very scary nightmare sequence, for the most part THE GATE is hamstrung from going to far in it's execution, which may turn off a lot of die hard horror fanatics. The film is also absent of any real gore, minus a shard of glass plucking out an eye ball, that is embedded in the lead hero's hand & the after-mentioned Barbie doll stabbing. For the most part, any gore the film does have, comes from the destruction of the monsters themselves, young Glen at one point uses his fingers to tear into the face of a demon, pretending to be his father spewing out loads of green slime before his head falls off & hits the pavement with a splat. The violence is very minimal at times, almost non existent. TheMinions mini demons are hardly what one would call menacing or scary, instead they come off as rather laughable & oddly cute, in truth I don't now where the mini monster idea came from, but it looks like it belongs in a FULL MOON/CHARLES BAND production, than here, they don't serve any purpose in the story. The film also has a really good build up, leading into what is unfortunately a cheat ending, in which all those who have died or taken into the portals of hell, are allowed to come back (Terry & Alexandra & the family dog) it's almost as if the film-makers were afraid to end the film on a rather dire ending, to me this would have made for a much more powerful & emotional ending for the young hero. All in all, THE GATE makes for a fun viewing experience, true it stumbles a bit due to it's PG-13 rating, regardless of that, it's still a pretty fun time & well worth a look for horror fans. Followed by GATE II RETURN TO THE NIGHTMARE (a.k.a.

Through a set of strange coincidences they actually perform a bunch of acts that when done all together open the gate to hell.  The other main character is the main boy's sister and both he and she like firing rocket fire works and this is emphasized way too much in this one.  There is a party and a sleep over that goes wrong as the minions of hell are released as little demons.  The highlight in this one is where the zombie construction worker falls down.

Even for adult viewers, The Gate can be enjoyable as long as you can get past the silly plot and typically teenage acting performances. The story centers on three teenagers, Glen (Stephen Dorff was a better actor at age 14 than he is now) who's obsessed with toy-rockets, his sister Alexandra (busy discovering boys and slumber parties) and pal Terry (obviously having issues). They discover a deep hole in Glen's backyard and, for no particular reason; ancient demons decide to make this their passageway to take over the world. The Gate is a well-intended and often professionally made film, with subtle parody (towards metal music, abandoning parents&#133;) and imaginatively animated demons. Its only flaw is that director Tak√°cs takes it all too seriously. The screenplay desperately tries to be convincing while it clearly doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. Make-believe bogeymen suddenly turn out real, dead dogs keep on moving from their place, etc etc&#133; I'm sure that, if Tak√°cs had focused on the irony more, his film would now be regarded as a minor classic. Instead, it's just a bit of forgettable fun.

Certainly the movie takes a place in my heart. Whether it is a good film or not is open to debate. I think it is good, but maybe my judgment is clouded by the nostalgia, the fond memories of the film. I just watched it for the fourth time, and it still seemed good to me. The special effects are pretty strong for their time, and really should be praised.The film is a 1980s film, clearly, with its bright colored clothes and unusual love for heavy metal music. But it really is something more -- a timeless story of kids and monsters (very different from, but in the same spirit as, The Monster Squad). The film is scary in many ways (the workman, the demon king, the eye) but yet still has that childlike sense of fun and adventure. You never really feel anyone is in danger.A modern classic? Perhaps. The Gate is the high point of Tibor Tak√°cs' career, who made Gate II and I, Madman before moving to television and cheesy SyFy movies. This was also a great feather in the cap of visual effects master Randall William Cook, who went on to work on those other two films, and then bigger things like Ghost Busters and the Lord of the Rings franchise (where he won three Academy Awards).While Stephen Dorff went on to bigger things, Christa Denton faded away.

No real blood, no cursing, and almost no violence. But it is a better-than-average family horror fest, although it fails at points.The Gate is the entrance to hell. After a couple of workmen removed a tree stump from the yard, two kids go digging in a hole, where they find a pretty cool stash of geodes, which contain some kind of strange, flashing crystals.Terry, the neighbor, and the stranger of the two kids, gets the idea that beneath the hole is the Gate to hell. After digging in the hole, he and his friend find some strange markings that coincide with some underground cacophanous German death metal group who chant the spell that opens the Gate. Smart kids that these two are, they're going to have some fun and see if it really works.Needless to say, the results aren't pretty because out of the Gate, once the kids unlock the spell (and get this, playing the record backwards contains the formula for closing the Gate), they unleash these minature demons who run around the house terrorizing the kids. If that's not bad enough, they also unlock a zombie and the mother-load of demons, which creates complete and total havoc. The special effects for this movie are actually pretty decent, considering both the story and the budget. The little demons, the huge beast, and even the zombie workmen was pretty cool for it's day mostly using stop-motion animation. However, there are a lot of poor elements to this movie.First is the incredibly horrible acting, especially from the sister's whiny friends. Second, the story takes all year to get off the ground because most of what we see is the just the brother and sister (and her friends, too) bickering. And it goes on and on. The focus on things surrounding the Gate really doesn't happen until a good chunk of the movie passes. Probably about halfway through, things start to actually get interesting, and we finally get to the story. Third, the way the children defeat the demons is pretty stupid, and far too easy. I know it's just a kids horror movie, but hell, at least have some fun with it. The first set of demons are eliminated through readings of random passages from the Bible. The second mega-demon is just killed with a wimpy little rocket. (The better parts of the movie, especially visually, occuring the elmination of the first and second demons. Most fo the movie is just wasted time. But really, was this movie approved by the church or something? Backwards records, deviant metal groups, Bible phobic demons? Better for kids. I'm going to give up on watching family horror films. This and 'Pulse' were both big disappointments for me. But I think it's because I'm just too old to watch these anymore.

The movie basically has 3 characters in it Glen and his sister Al and Glen's best friend Terry. It takes place completely in a house and mostly at night.Visually this movie is dreadful. Half the time the special effects in this movie I couldn't tell what they were supposed to be and the other half they were not too good. Yes I know the film was made with a very low budget and was made in 1987 but I have seen better.Short Summary of the movie. Glen digs a hole and finds a geode rock, he opens it with Terry and it has light in it and it writes something. Later Glen and Terry think something is wrong. Then Terry is listening to Heavy Metal music jumping on his bed and chanting the lyrics with the record. Then Terry realizes that this record just happens to have a Dark Book in it that contains the same writing as what was written later and he reads the book and figures out there are demons in the hole and him and Glen must seal the hole or they will destroy the world. Blah Blah Blah the demons come alive and destroy the house, take Terry and Al as sacrifices and Glen destroys the Demon with a large rocket. To mark the destruction of the demon fire works go off over his destroyed house. And Terry and Al come back to life and all is well.As you can tell from that summary the movie has a weak plot and take my word for it. It is rather boring. It stands out as the worst movie of 1987 that I have ever seen. Which is why I rate it as a 1 (awful).

This movie sucks.  You know why, because you stink like garbage.  That's just my line I say to my friends.  Anyway, this movie sucks because the movie itself and the graphics are way too cheesy.

It has all the 80's horror garbage in it.  The whole movie comes off like a cheesy attempt by Jerry Falwell to demonstrate what becomes of teenagers who disobey their parents and go to Hell.

Young kids open the gate to an ancient netherworld which may be hell.  A sorry screenplay, sophomoric performances, and a lack of real direction make this film one of those you should avoid at all costs.  This film is such a dud that it could not even achieve an R-rating (which is strange for a horror film) when it was released in 1987. Turkey (0 out of 5 stars).   "},{"Title":"The Goonies with Trolls","Date":"28 June 2010","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Gate, The (1987) ** (out of 4) Lightening strikes a tree, which leaves a large hole in the ground, which just happens to be a gateway to some demons. Three kids (Stephen Dorff, Christa Denton, Louis Tripp) eventually have to battle these demons when their parents leave them home alone for the weekend. This has a large cult following and even though I grew up watching horror films throughout the 80s, this is one I never got around to checking out. While watching the movie I really could see why some might love this thing as it's pretty much another clone of THE GOONIES and I'm sure many watched this as a kid, connected with the kids in the film and just liked the idea of fighting off these small creatures from Hell. With that said, the movie just didn't work for me. There were a number of reasons why but the biggest is that nothing really happens until the fifty-minute mark and then we get a couple action scenes and then it appears the film is over only to then kick it into another gear for yet another 25-minutes worth of action. Another problem I had with the film were the actual demons. They're small, unscary and way too cute to be very menacing. Not for a second did the film ever build up any type of suspense and not once did I feel that any of the characters were in danger. Some might say there's nothing wrong with that but we are watching a horror movie and a horror flick without any danger is pretty pointless. Yet another problem is that the screenplay takes the subject matter way too serious and yet it never makes a bit of sense. We're given a story as to what's going on but it'll just leave you scratching your head. Fans of gore aren't going to find much here, although we do get one terrific sequence where the boys goes to jump in his father's arms only to eventually have his head melt off! What I enjoyed most about the film were the performances by Dorff, Denton and Tripp. All three fit their roles quite nicely and they're all charming enough from start to finish. They're certainly not Oscar-worthy but they're good enough for this type of material. "}]
