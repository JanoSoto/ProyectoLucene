This is a great film.  It boldly creates a world unlike any we've seen before, with dedicated actors going well beyond the call of duty in portraying a life and death struggle for survival under the most harrowing conditions imaginable. Featuring Claude Agostini's splendid wide-screen cinematography of remote, rainswept landscapes and a rich score by Phillipe Sarde, this movie will take you on a compelling journey that, if nothing else, will clarify the routine creature comforts of our civilized world in a manner more direct than anything you might have previously experienced in a theater. Jean-Jacques Annaud and collaborators tell their tale with dramatic simplicity and virtually no dialogue, but the points made are powerful.  Humanity survives, and will prevail despite our weaknesses and faults.  Overall, a remarkable, life-affirming work.

Three of the tribe leave their home to search for a new source of fire to bring back to their people before the cold climate can take its toll. Their journey brings them not only into contact with other tribes of prehistoric humans at different stages of evolution but also advances their own humanity, as well as teaching them to be prometheuses in their own right.An absolutely fascinating film. Those who are partial to history and anthropology will especially enjoy this. An honest, un-PC look at the origins of the species and the development of humanity through loss, tragedy, hardship, hostile elements and the beginnings of laughter, morality, community service, leadership, friendship and of course, love. A wondrous feat of body language performances as there is no truly discernible language/dialogue spoken. This is a well done, well made film all around.For those into scenery gazing the beauty of the locations (Canada, Iceland, Kenya, Scotland) alone are worth a rental fee.Ron Perlman is one of the three male leads/would be prometheuses. Watch the body language! Someone did research! A difficult and impressive (first movie) performance. Definitely worth a buy (the DVD has two commentaries, one with the director Jean-Jacques Annaud, one with producer Michael Gruskoff, Rae Dawn Chong and Ron Perlman).

I have always been enthralled by movies that take place in prehistoric times, but I never expected this movie to be filmed with such consistency.  This film captures an innocent adventure, in which three men (Naoh, Amoukar,& Gaw) are selected by the tribe to recapture their snuffed out fire.  The journey brings them into many trials of existence, which we modern beings very seldom come in contact with.  At points, there scenes that capture a sense of humor that is so basic to our modern way of thinking, but for these characters they are just discovering such things like the concept of laugher.  At other points of the film, these brave men encounter situations that show the true brutal world of the survival of the fittest.  The manner in which these characters search for fire gives the viewer a true love for the characters courage and heroic nature.  For if they do not succeed, it is surely the end of their tribe and for them.  The fire holds the key to survival with its warmth, cooking function, and most of all its ability to ward off stalking predators.  Fire is power for beings at this point in time.  Just as knowledge is for modern human beings.This film succeeds in it's proportions,direction, settings, music, great special effects,and acting.  The acting especially is something to take notice of, since there is no recognizable language spoken.  The preparation for such a role as this these is amazing in its own right.  Quest for Fire will lead you into the reality of what once was and capture the essence of the human spirit.

If memory serves, the hype concerned the efforts to turn an elephant into a mastodon using make-up and an actress running around nude. In other words, the film in my mind fell into the 'One Million Year BC' category and I ignored it.Later, I learned who Annaud was and admired 'The Name of the Rose' for its direction, its translation of a difficult book and its effort at realism. Finally, I rented 'Quest for Fire' on DVD and saw it on the big home screen. (In fact, I watched it several months ago and I'm commenting now because it remains in my mind.)Experts can quibble about the realism. But for me, this film makes an intelligent and credible effort to present a world of 80,000 years ago. In this, it raises good questions about who we are as a species. Human genetic code has not changed in that time and any one of the beings portrayed would be perfectly capable of using a computer as I'm doing now. Nonetheless, they lived in a world without numbers, without prices, without trade, without written language and without means to create fire. Everyone alive today had an ancestor who survived those conditions. 'Quest for Fire' is a must-see for anyone curious about the human condition.

This was executed beautifully and skillfully in the depiction of several diverse tribal groups, explaining the well deserved Oscar for makeup.When Naoh finds the love of his life in one of these other tribes, it is because there is an element of compatibility both between the cultures and the two individuals supporting the attraction they share. Some of the other groups depicted don't do as well in the tribal intercourse and cultural sharing department, as they tend to eat the individuals from other tribes that they encounter.Another elements of realism that scores big with me was that there are attacks by wild animals as well as by anthropoids. I also liked the language used by the main tribe, there was a suggestion that the language was evolving right before us as the travelers, having been sent on a quest for fire, returned with quite a bit more to talk about.This is one of my favorite movies, possibly the most favorite.

In prehistoric times, having fire meant survival from the cold and protection from predators.In this film, facial gestures, hand movements, general body language and mannerisms of the characters are all consistent with conclusions about early man, as a result of thorough anthropological research. In lieu of modern language the film's dialogue consists of some 350 invented words and sounds, also based on research. In addition, an important part of the film is attention to detail in costumes and makeup, for which the film won several awards. All of these technical cinematic elements combine to create a reasonably accurate visual and audio impression of mankind as it existed some 80,000 years ago.As you would expect, the film is shot entirely in rugged, remote locations, resulting in landscapes that are stunningly beautiful. Background music is generally low-key and ethereal, like what you might hear in a sci-fi film. There's lots of flute sounds, which reinforce the simplicity of the time period.For all its technical achievements, this film's main weakness may be the screenplay. When you take away the artifacts of modern life, you're very limited in the kind of story you can tell. And that clearly is the case here, with a plot that drones on with a monotony and repetition that can be tedious, and at times difficult for some viewers.Although the story's entertainment value may be marginal, Quest For Fire, with its low tech cinematic style, is interesting not only for its technical elements but also for its over arching theme of modern human's continuity with prehistoric man, based on the element of fire.

The story centers around a tribe that has not yet learned to start a fire. They have to steal fire from other tribes, or find it in nature. So much of their efforts are centered on keeping a fire constantly nurtured, and if their fire goes out, the entire tribe suffers the elements. However, this is not a simple caveman flick. The filmmakers portray the development of human attributes such as humor and laughing, connection between males and females beyond the pure sexual, language development, story telling, cross-pollination of ideas between tribes of different levels of advancement, and at the end, the awakening of a sense of the transcendent. I find the film to be a compelling drama even after 25 years, and it does not seem at all dated. If you have even the slightest interest in early man, this film is a must-see.

As accurate as anything prehistoric can be since anthropologists are probably even worse than historians about agreeing on theories. Whatever is the truth, it felt believable for that period. I thought at first it might devolve into cheap cavemen antics and the costumes for the second tribe seen seemed really lame but the movie grew a lot on me. It's actually a movie about the transition from ape to man condensed into a relatively short time for one tribe. It's actually more philosophical and emotional than one might initially think. What makes us humans instead of animals? Everything was filmed on outside locations with real animals (sometimes modified to look prehistoric) and it shows in the scope and authenticity. It felt strangely grim, uncomfortable and disorienting to me, which when I think about it, is probably how those tribesmen going on the quest must have felt.They even had a famous linguist/author, Anthony Burgess, invent a language for the ape men to communicate. There aren't even any subtitles. It was made so anyone in the world can see this and understand which is a feat in itself. The beautiful musical score certainly helped counteract the lack of intelligible words by conveying the drama of the times. The performances were very good and convincing especially the one by Rae Dawn Chong (strange female covered in gray makeup) who had the guts to be mostly naked throughout the film. Look also for Ron Perlman in his first role. From the commentaries, the actors really suffered a lot during shooting for the sake of authenticity (such as walking barefoot all the time).

This one is fiction rather than fact, and it incorporates some decent scientific accuracy, as well as some VERY primitive, but clever humor, and some cute creature effects for the amazing beasts which shared Ice Age Europe with us a hundred thousand years ago.The great thing about movies like Quest for Fire is the way they can be universally appreciated. There is no classifiable language, it can be enjoyed equally in all countries. People are saying the same thing about WALL-E, but this is actually a better example. After all regardless of Nation, creed, and color, we all evolved from the same creatures.We follow the semi-epic journey of Neanderthal trio which has been sent by their clan to bring back the gift of fire, after the clan has been kicked out of their massive cave home by the clan of another species. The three of them have to hurry before their brothers and sister freeze to death. Along the way they find a skinny little Homo Sapien girl (that's our species), she is a long way from home and she urges them to help her get back to her people. Reluctantly they do. However, things to do turn out to be so bad when, they discover that these people know how to make fire. In truth we will never fully know how our ancestors lived, but the fossil remains we have discovered are numerous and can give us a descent understanding. Today, twenty years later, we know twice as much. It is now believed that Neaderthals did not have dark hair, but red hair. I doubt that the majority of people who watch quest for fire will care about science and anthropology, but I think the film is more interesting if you do care. Otherwise you are liable to see quest for fire as old hat, long been replaced by modern movie magic.

It reminded me why I was so disappointed in two recent animated movies dealing with material that's in the same ballpark, Dinosaur and The Ice Age. In those two films there is this fear to simply let the characters stand mute even if it means making them speak dialogue that isn't necessarily very interesting and often anachronistic. I found it interesting how Quest for Fire compelled me to fill in the blanks on what was going on in the characters' minds. In some strange way I could almost identify with how fire would seem like some divine creation.It's amazing when a filmmaker can take something so simple and so mundane and yet make it so profound.

This is the most faithful telling of the tragic lives of the Neanderthals. Clan of the Cave Bear was a good movie, but I seriously question the order that the Clan had in that time. I don't believe that Clans and tribes were praying to spirits, or had women in them. Quest for Fire has no language whatsoever, although it is not difficult to interpret what the tribe is trying to accomplish (i.e. the film's title). The best scene of this picture is when the tribe discovers the mammoths and uses them to fend off an evil, cannibalistic, rival tribe who wants to out do them. The most romantic scene is when Everett McGill (Naoh), and Rae Dawn Chong (Ika), have sex. She is a girl they discover on their quest, who teaches them to make fire. She teaches him that proper way to have sex, instead of from behind. To read my comment on that scene, you'll probably be rupulsed, but you will see that the scene is not meant to be carnal, but to tell the one of the first romances to evolve. See this film ASAP!

Apart from being riddled with inaccuracies as far as science is concerned (such as the tiny fact that these four types of early hominids did *not* exist at the same time, nor in the same areas of the world), the Australopithecus afarensis look like extras from Plant of the Apes, the Homo erectus are big, oafish cannibals, and, naturally, the archaic Homo sapiens are sophisticates with a well-developed fertility culture.The protagonists of Quest for Fire are three Neandertals who go searching for fire after being attacked by the troll-like A. afarensis and losing the ember with which they always begin their blazes. Whilst the film does a good job of telling the story without a single word of any recognizable language, the storyline is disturbing (and disturbingly inaccurate) at times, particularly when our heroes stumble upon H. erectus gnawing on the arm of a (still-living) H. sapiens, or when the Neandertals had the urge for a little coital action. Still, when one considers what was known by paleoanthropologists in the 80's (when this movie was made), some allowance can be made&#151;a tiny, miniscule fraction of allowance.

Quest for Fire is one of those movies. My dictionary defines realism in part as, ...accurate representation without idealization. Thus, a movie such as One Million Years BC is not realistic, nor does it pretend to be, it is pure fantasy. Even Creatures the World Forgot, the most realistic of the Hammer caveman movies, takes pains to present us with idealized men and women in skimpy outfits. Quest for Fire is realistic, not because every little historical fact has been detailed, but because it makes a serious effort at appearing historically accurate, without sacrificing or compromising dramatic story elements.Most movies that aim for realism fall flat in terms of drama. They end up like a documentary. Compare Quest with Clan of the Cave Bear - Clan falls flat in drama because the action seen on screen and its consequences are narrated and translated for us. We are removed from the action, distanced. We become mere spectators. Not so with Quest for Fire. Quest presents us with an engaging dramatic story which unfolds as the movie progresses.The brilliance of the story in Quest is that it is shifted away from a personal story. The focus is not on one main character growing to adulthood, testing or proving themselves; it is not about who gets the girl, or how a rivalry plays out. The central character of this story is not a person. The central character is fire - and the story is all about getting fire, holding onto fire, defending the possession of fire. From the opening shot (and what a great shot) to the closing shot (ditto), the focus is fully on fire. As we follow one humanoid group and their war for fire we watch how four groups of humanoids in various stages of evolution utilize and master the most precious element in this setting - fire.What makes the film really good is that you feel immersed in the world that has been presented. The setting is cold and lonely, the landscape vast and unforgiving. Pleistocene creatures are represented with wolves, mammoths, saber-toothed lions, antelope, and cave bears. The details of human gesture, expression and rudimentary language have a sense of rightness, they seem authentic. The various humanoids are shown with what appear to be authentic cultural traits.Is this movie historically accurate? No it is not. But the substance of this imagined world of 80,000 years ago is so convincing, you feel like you are actually there. No other caveman movie has been able to achieve an authentic sense of realism combined with an excellent story.

It has lost none of its excitement and charm. In fact I think the film ages well like a fine wine. The performances are all excellent but for me the revelation was just how good Everett McGill was in the part of Naoh. His performance is superb and the binding force that lets you understand and enjoy the Film.The DVD picture quality is great as is the sound. The extras are quite extensive as well. There is an informative and amusing commentary track by the Director. A separate commentary by the self-praising Rae Dawn Chong and the agreeable Ron Perlman, unfortunately they are not joined by Everett McGill. Jean-Jacques Annaud, the director of the film, is the star of the bonus material and luckily he is a very intelligent and an amusing raconteur. There is a Making of documentary and more commentaries over production stills and location recce material. The only question that seems to linger is the lack of references to Everett McGill or his wonderful performance. Ron Perlman is constantly praised and the story of his audition is often quoted and remarked upon, as is the discovery of Rae Dawn Chong. During the directors commentary he remarks that another actor was cast as Naoh but left after disagreements with the movement coach. The director was forced to fly to America to cast the roll at short notice. That's it. Never is Everett McGill referred too directly or even praised. Everett McGill is the soul of the Film and holds it all together. He also got frostbite while crossing a freezing river in Scotland at the insistence of the demanding director, so does not that in itself deserve extraordinary and unbiased praise? "}{"Title":"The ultimate Period Piece!","Date":"4 June 2006","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, History","Review":" A problem reviewing movies with neither dialogue nor sub-titles is that there may not be a lot left to comment on. This is certainly not true of 'Quest for Fire' but the comment from your user, 'Evolvest' from Texas, (It really looks like we are seeing through a window of time 80,000 years ago, in all its beauty and ugliness) seems to say almost all that is necessary in just 20 words. My comments here relate to what we can expect to see when we look through this window. If we are perceptive enough to observe what is shown, but never blatantly displayed, it can be surprisingly rewarding. The first thing we might comment on is the remarkably effective communication achieved, not only between the actors themselves but also between the actors and the moviegoers, simply through body language (thanks here go to Desmond Morris). The next is the clever field work and camera work which mean we are relatively unaware of whether the sequence concerned was filmed in Iceland, Scotland, Canada or Kenya; and regardless of which is shown we accept all these scenarios as one true contiguous wilderness unmarked by civilization. For achieving both this and the credibility of the various scenes in the movie, Annaud deserved some special award - not many directors can have faced comparable problems. Soon after this we begin to appreciate how closely fire and life were linked for the people of this age, without fire they will either be killed in their caves by wild beasts or die of starvation or cold. We think of our well heated dry homes with well stocked larders, and then of what it must really have been like to have lived under the conditions shown. We recognise that these were very early men, but men just like ourselves and just as capable of appreciating and using the benefits of technology. Instead they faced many more centuries of existence before achieving even the primitive level of technological competence required by the earliest civilization.When their source of fire was lost we appreciate the heroism shown by the three tribesmen who undertake to search for a replacement, and on their travels we share with them their immense surprise when they encountered other tribes with slightly different levels of technological development., we note that some of these tribes were friendly but that, even at this early time, others only wanted to hunt, kill, and perhaps eat them. This leads us to ponder on the origin of human aggressiveness and on how it can ever be brought under control. We watch fascinated as their mutual quest alone together brings the three tribesmen closer with mutual bonding which would probably never have taken place if they had stayed in their community. We may even think we can detect the origins of human love as distinct from lust (although this is perhaps a little fanciful). We also see a dawning ability to accept and adapt to the concept of technological change, which is suddenly dramatically enhanced when they discover from a more advanced tribe that fire can be produced artificially. In essence, during the few days hunting for fire we can see the results of many centuries of normal evolution taking place. This is a truly great film because few viewers will watch all this and not develop a better understanding of themselves and their place in the present world.The film wisely leaves open the question of whether the Ulam tribe our heroes belonged to would benefit enough from these traumas to catch up with their more advanced rivals who had already mastered the art of creating fire, or whether they would eventually encounter another crisis that they could not surmount and would become extinct. However all the tribes shown are at similar stages of development, and are genetically compatible. Intermarriage can be a quick way to play catch-up, and the film hints at this when Ika joins our three heroes and is taken back to the Ulam tribe with them.This film is virtually unique, but it reminds me strongly of a book Before Adam written by Jack London which I read in my teens. The theme is very similar - it is in autobiographical form and takes the form of unusually dramatic and vivid dreams experienced and reported by a modern man. In these dreams, which he attributes to some genetic quirk, he becomes 'Big Tooth' one of the primitive 'tree people' whose territory lies quite close to that of a more advanced tribe - the 'fire people'. Big Tooth comes into contact with a female he calls the 'Swift One' who has fled from her own tribe and is afraid to live in any community. They set up a cave home together shortly before the fire people attack his tribe and kill almost all of them. The book ends with the modern man recognising that 'Big Tooth' and his mate must have survived to have offspring that passed on the genetic quirk which eventually resurfaced in him and led to these autobiographical dreams. The point of interest here is that the novel recognises different tribes may all be more advanced in different and specific ways. Big Tooth had no means for creating fire but had trained a dog to help in hunting. Although more advanced in this respect, survival was most closely associated with weapon development, and different tribes had no qualms in wiping out possible rivals to their territories. This must have been essentially how it was for many thousands of years, although probably many of the women survived and contributed genes to the gene pool of the conquerors so advancing the evolutionary process. I would recommend this book to the consideration of any daring and creative film-maker prepared to produce another serious film about prehistoric man.

Having no knowledge in the making of fire, a small group of tribesmen are sent in a quest to find fire by retrieving it from nature or from other tribes they would meet. In their journey they encounter cannibal Neanderthals, Homo Sapiens, mammoths and saber tooth tigers, they travel into freezing and windy steppes, up mountains and through swamps, in a beautifully realistic Paleolithic Europe carved by the ice age, like no movie has yet managed to grasp so beautifully. To add to realism, there is no dialog in the movie. Actually, there is dialog, only it is in a primitive language (invented for the movie) which we do not understand, and there are no subtitles so its to the viewer to interpret what's going on (don't worry, its not hard).As a student in archeology specialized in prehistory and mainly in the Neanderthal cultures, I must say that this film corresponds quite well to what I imagine Europe was like 80,000 years ago. Only there are some mistakes or scientifically debatable aspects in this movie, but to its defense it was inspired by a book of the same name written in 1911, when our knowledge in prehistory was very weak.The English title is quite appropriate. It is indeed a quest, an epic journey in a mysterious and terrifying past where only man's wits and ability to control fire gave him the ability to survive against the cruel forces of nature. During the journey of the protagonists, there is a clever mix of horror, emotion and humor in their adventures. The photography is baffling, as well as the music and the general atmosphere.This movie is perfect and if I didn't give it a 10/10 its because of the few scientific mistakes which, as an archaeologist, kind of make me cringe. Nonetheless I recommend this masterpiece to everyone.

I suppose credit has to go first to the makeup department, who made a pretty convincing set of these creatures. The story is interesting and well-acted, especially considering that the cast was working with the significant limitation of not speaking a word of English (or any other known human language) in the whole movie. As might be expected, given the context, the story is violent (and, at times, even brutal.) Somewhat surprisingly, there is also a more gentle touch included, especially contributed by the character played by Rae Dawn Chong - belonging to a tribe more advanced than the primary tribe of the movie, who introduces the lead tribe to more advanced human traits such as laughter and affection, if not love.The presence of the various tribes was one of the weaknesses here as well, though. As best as I could make out, there seem to be three different humanoid species represented. What I know about human evolution is essentially what I remember from high school biology, but from the makeup the tribes appeared to be australopithecine (the ape men at the beginning of the movie), neanderthal (the primary tribe of the movie) and cro-magnon, essentially modern humans. The problem is that, from what I remember of those high school biology classes, I'm not sure those three species ever co-existed. I'm not sure that any three humanoid species ever co-existed in the same time and place. So that represented a bit of a muddle to me. The mammoths portrayed also lacked authenticity to me. I thought they looked exactly like what they were - elephants with makeup on.Still, this is a good movie, if a bit fanciful and even with the possibility of inaccuracies. Although probably not made with this intention, I appreciated that the movie offered a good glimpse at the cause of conflict even in today's world. The tribes fought each other because they all wanted fire. Today's world generally assumes that conflict is about ideological or religious differences, which is nonsense. People fight because one side has what the other wants.

Their whole performances had to be done using some foreign language and body movement but they pulled it off. I heard Anthony Burgess was called in to develop the language used and coach the cast in how to use it. The cinematography is just breath-taking and the prehistoric animals look realistic all the way. I can't exactly say why I loved this movie but I did. 20th Century Fox deserves credit for actually acquiring the film and releasing it.

The disturbing/campy violence ultimately yields a fairly interesting subtext. The film's aesthetic is pretty arresting. And seeing the shaman of Ika's tribe make fire is just plain neat.Even the love story finally kind of works in spite of the fact it's a patriarchal/phallocentric fantasy (I mean, she asks for something new in the bedroom, and it's *missionary*?), mostly because Rae Dawn Chong acts the hell out of her (ridiculous) scenes.

If the absence of modern languages or subtitles confuses you, you're either not paying attention or you're just not doing the imaginative work to wonder how a barely verbal language might operate.The movie isn't `realistic.'  Putting aside the silly sentimental interaction with the Mammoths, the movie does try to dispense with most of the mistakes of prehistoric movies no pointless grunting (what grunting we hear is convincingly simian and consistent in meaning), no, good lord, dinosaurs, no fur bikinis, &c.  But the movie's conjectural, not `realistic' (whatever science Annaud used was no doubt already out of date by the time he got hold of it).  It's best to think of the movie as Annaud's primordial fantasy why do you think he made this world in the way he did?  In particular, what asinine idea compelled Annaud to show the `missionary position' as a step up in civilization?That aside, I'd say see the movie, but if you want a `realistic' theory of how our ancestors might have lived, supplement this movie with, I guess, some contemporary anthropology.  What I liked about it was this it's clear that the heroes of the movie are not the most capable of the humanoid species we see.  Rae Dawn Chong's tribe is the species that will inherit the earth, and they're going to contribute, if not cause, the extinction of all other humanoid species.  The fire-questing tribe--barely linguistic, barely capable of using or creating tools--struggles for fire, struggles to learn technology, suffers and suffers, and nothing will come of any of this except their eventual extinction.

He thereby takes a giant first step in humanity's long pursuit of bigger and better weapons. On the other hand, Quest for Fire dramatizes humanity's other side the civilizing arrival of the campfire. But not just any campfire; instead it's the security found in mastering the technique to make fire any time the tribe wants. As a result, the Cro-Magnons have for the first time some control over their environment and can take time to relax. That's made apparent at film's end when the clan gathers happily around crackling embers to relate stories through crude gestures and grunts. Perhaps the evolution of complex linguistic forms had its origins in just such relaxed moments, when imagination and thinking could take hold and get expression in the company of others.There's also that overlooked moment when Naoh humbly approaches the lordly herd of marauding mastodons. Tufts of grass in hand, he bows his head in an unmistakable gesture of submission, to which the herd responds-- not very plausibly --by chasing away the attacking cannibal clan. The point here is that Naoh understands in that quiet moment that we must live humbly with those forces much greater than ourselves if we want to survive-- a possible seed of what would later become religious belief, whether in the forces of nature or in the supposed power of the supernatural.Of course, this is all speculation. The filmmakers don't exactly hit you over the head with their messages. However, the point is that the film succeeds admirably in getting you to think about the natural history of what these lowly but momentous origins must have been like. Moreover, there are other suggestive moments, such as when the camera transitions from Rae Dawn Chong's pregnant belly to the distant full moon and humanity's far-off future. Some reviewers point out scientific flaws in the script and reject the film on that basis. But that misses the point. Of course the film is not a documentary, so no serious researcher would base a study on it. Nonetheless, the movie remains just that, a well-staged and provocative ninety minutes of unusual filmmaking. I've seen nothing like it before or since.

During their search, these 3 tribes man come across a few life threatening scenarios that some critics considered out of place, for instance Saber Tooth tigers and Woolly Mammoths. Some believe that the creatures were out of the time period, but when we know that 10 thousand years old Woolly Mammoths remains were found in Siberia a few decades ago, the creatures were not at all out of place for early hominids who lived a million years ago.

I shall enumerate in reverse order and since there are only a handful of them dealing with certain degree of historical accuracy on the Ice Ages, Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens proper viz., watch also 10,000 BC (2008), Clan Of The Cave Bear (1986), Caveman (1981) and One Million Years BC (1940, remake 1966). All those movies deal with life and adventures of Cavemen in real surroundings, using (hypothetical) artificially devised language and there is no thread of modern civilization involved, which is another lead plot where time is disposed and Lost Worlds discovered with strange Nature and extinct Animals. The most often exploited of those are the revived Iceman theme or the Dinosaur theme revisited. A solid earring for the unabashed spectator is the most often repeated misnomer - that Man and Dinosaurs never cohabited together, the latter were long time extinct before the Homo species appeared in evolution ladder. Whatever, let go to the principal idea that made me write those lines and these concern the Mother of all Entertainments on Prehistory, less documentaries and other scientific stuff - the Pif Gadget and its Rahan Series.I am a good man and used to be a very inquisitive kid, at least for the standards of former Socialist Country. Today I have turned into a middleman, who is pursued by homeless dogs in the Streets and trekked by schizophrenics at Home. This dispatch have nothing to do with my political convictions and mishaps in personal life or work (Guess I don't sound convincing but will continue right on topic) As I said, Pif Gadget was a comic magazine that was in high circulation in France and less so in the United States. Maybe even Americans at my age haven't heard about these cartoons which originated shortly in post-war France, firstly about adventures of Pif the Dog and Hercule the Cat in an illustrated magazine called Vaillant which issued in big newspaper size. It also appeared on stands in Socialist countries because presumably was outlet from French Communist Party, whether its true or not I am not aware.From 1969 it changed its name and numeration to Pif Gadget with a smaller size (double A4) which was wrapped in celluloid nylon plus a simple toy attached to the whole parcel. So this bundle was my favorite pastime as kid in the 1970s and although I didn't understand French the pictures in the comic strips spoke for themselves and I was fascinated. Special interest deserved the adventures of Rahan the Caveman, but also other heroes such as Doc Justice the Medicine Man, Teddy Ted the Cowboy, Loup Noir the Indian, Nasdine Hodja the Turk, Jeremie the Pirate Kid, etc. Specifically the Rahan case, first series appeared in 1970s where bi-monthly for some 7-8 years came about 150 issues with Rahan (black-and-white, to be continued format). Thus I gathered the magazine for years in a row before I decided that have become grown-up and sold them half price to the local Antiquary. The whole collection would have been priceless today but unfortunately its unattainable at low price.Now let me return to the titular movie Quest for Fire (1981), based on sci-fi novel by J.H. Rosny (pseudonym of collaborative work by two brothers). Here the interested reader can get additional information from pages in Wikipedia. The more debatable problem, however, concerning Ice Age as a unity is How control of fire became a turning point in human evolution? Go to the adequate page in Wikipedia and you will learn important details on this enormous leap of humankind. Before fire ape-man was a carnivore and hardly bi-pedal. After that he became slowly more and more cultivated, get into shelter, get aware of sexual dimorphism, etc. The story of agriculture and first great civilizations come at much later stage, not earlier than 10 000 years ago.

Someone actually did a decent amount of research in making this film and genuinely wanted to give a realistic glimpse into the ancestry of our species. In a genre that is known for fur bikinis and battles with non-contemporaneous dinosaurs, QfF is probably the best film dealing with prehistoric humanity. It is certainly far better than the godawful Clan of the Cave Bear and the not-worth-mentioning-but-will-anyway 10,000 B.C.Somewhere in prehistoric Eurasia, a Neanderthal tribe called the Ulams are going about their daily Neanderthal business(grooming each other for insects and non-concensual sex) when they are savagely attacked by a tribe of ape-like Homo Erectus, called the Wagabus. The Wagabus are after their fire and their women, and after a brief rumble the Ulams flee into the forest and are then chased by a wolf pack into a swamp. They lose the fire, and as they are unable to make it, the tribe is melancholy and fearful, and their survival seems in doubt. The Ulam elder elects three men - Naoh(Everett McGill, Dune, People Under the Stairs), Amoukar(Ron Perlman, Hellboy , Ice Pirates) and Gah (Nicholas Kadi, Sleeper Cell, Congo)-to retrieve fire. They embark on a journey to find fire and save the tribe.First and foremost, QiF deserves praise for its actors. This movie made me realize how portraying a prehistoric human is a very challenging role for any actor to undertake. Perlman, McGill and Kadi apparently did extensive research on great ape behavior and give performances that are never campy. There are no subtitles, which prompts them to put more effort into expressing these characters. The cinematography is impressive and the prehistoric landscape is well displayed. The use of real animals and both imagined and established linguistics also gives them film a degree of realism. Rae Dawn Chong also gives a believable performance as a young Cro Magnon girl the trio encounter on their quest.The film is, of course, flawed in some ways, but until someone has the motivation to make a REAL prehistoric epic that doesn't involve bad acting and CGI smilodons, CfF is as good as it gets.

This may provoke many, due to its raw, honest handling of its material... it is utterly unflinching in its depictions of situations from our ancient history. There is a bit of brutal, graphic, gory violence and disturbing content as well as some nudity(entire body, both genders) and sexuality(some of it forced) in this. Also note that you will see people eating things that we don't today(at least not like that), and that everyone in this looks filthy through and through(hair, skin, teeth). The authenticity is incredible... there is almost nothing unrealistic in this(our heroes do get through stuff they maybe shouldn't, a little). It does have a conventional three-arc story structure and our trio are the main characters, and with that, we can put the energy that would have been used trying to deal with that, towards figuring out exact motivations and what people are trying to do. Oh, did I not mention yet? The only language spoken in this is one that we do not understand(and there is no subtitling). We have to make due with interpreting their gestures and intonation, not to mention the excellent cinematic communication(this makes great use of film as a visual medium).

The richness of detail of these situations, how true to life and instincts it all is, immensely enhances all of the various encounters along the way(one sequence etched itself into my 69-year old father's memory so well that he could retell it to me about two and a half decades after watching it!).

It goes without saying that despite the attempts by the filmmakers (and including Anthony Burgess) to create a dialog of sorts for these 80,000 BC homo sapiens and neanderthals, that the power of the film lies in the simple intent of what's said, or felt with the dialog, than what one word might mean or another. As a purely visual experience, it's pretty good, if not really 'masterpiece' worthy. It's a minor cult item, to put it another way.In fact, it's the strength of incorporating a linear storyline into what is essentially a near plot less tale (what plot can there be with a quest for fire when it's not in the usual conventional mode of a 'quest'?) of a group of homo sapiens at odds with all the forces of nature- animals, neanderthals, rival 'gangs', weather, quicksand. There is a kind of 'romance' that blooms between one character (I forget who played him) and Rae Dawn Chong's talkative, happy but strong character, and the problems of her former tribe in developing the earliest stages of a tribal sacrifice and prison and whatnot.

I was always drawn to discover who we were, who we are, and this is the best exploration ever.The swamp people had learned to protect themselves with surrounding quick-bogs and thereby won the luxury of spare time for the development of language, hut building, pottery, better weapons, beer, drugs, laughter, the creation of fire, and even an appreciation of the value of out-breeding. (Mud covered skin keeps the swamp bugs at bay.) This was high civilization for the time.Even cannibals had a technology of their own. They didn't kill their prey outright, better to just carve off a piece for breakfast and leave the rest fresh for later.Packs of wolves were camp followers and preyed on humans. Smell was still a very valuable tool. A rotten carcass was used to mask one's scent (the reason that dogs roll in such foul stuff today).It is refreshing to witness superior man defeated by brutes, over and again, instead of the standard cliché. Washing in the rain, freezing in the Winter, fighting off predators and human enemies to survive for just another hour, this is where we came from. When I hear someone complaining too much about work, prices, or taxes, I'm just so very thankful that it wasn't me sitting on that log, in the middle of a swamp, in the Winter, naked, in a freezing drizzle, with no fire.

The scene in the swamp where they retreat is short but tells so much about their reliance on fire and how miserable they saw their future to be without it.The juxtaposition of Rae Dawn Chong's character against the rest is like a pixie to a bunch of clods and makes her one of the movies most fun characters.It's not quite a movie for little kids because they might be scared by some of the scenes, nor is it for those who are offended by primitive sex and/or nudity, but for the rest of us it's like a National Geographic article of the past come to life.

Essentially, it is a more realistic version of ONE MILLION, B.C. (1966) &#x96; that is to say exchanging fanciful dinosaur action for the humdrum titular expedition (following a bloody ambush by a simian-looking tribe) punctuated by scenes depicting primitive man's baser instincts. This typically revisionist approach renders an already unattractive milieu (with its general lack of incident &#x96; despite a script by Gerard Brach &#x96; and preponderance for silly grunting &#x96; conceived by Anthony Burgess, no less) that much closer to boredom! Its lasting qualities, then, are mainly visual ones (superb location photography and Oscar-winning make-up effects) and aural (by way of an appropriately grandiose score from the renowned composer Philippe Sarde). Curiously enough, despite its being, ostensibly, a French production (emerging a winner at that year's Cesars among others), the main actors are Americans Everett McGill, Rae Dawn Chong and Ron Perlman!

I remembered seeing it in ~81 and was pretty fascinated about it. But i forgot the title and couldn't find it on internet till now. So I'm looking forward to a review with my older eyes.I read some comments here, specially the negatives and on historical accuracy. Basically i think their objections lay in the fact that these different hominids did not co-exist, which is true as far as we know, with some exception; for instance the disappearance of Neanderthal and rising of cro magnon at the same period. There will probably have been more migrations from Africa to Eurasia, so it is not unlikely that newcomers had to find a place there. NOT as unlikely as stated, but not Australopithecus and not Java or Peking man. And apart from that, we keep adjusting knowledge about pre historic people as we go. Whether or not these people controlled fire is still a matter of discussion, was it homo erectus 1.5 million years ago, or Peking man, 500.000 years ago? Java man 1 million years ago? Australopitecus didn't seem to have it (6.5 - 1 million y.ago). Agreed, by the time archaic homo sapiens (120.000 years ago - modern history) stepped in, it was there for at least a couple of 100 thousand years. Still it is possible that knowledge was lost at times and had to be regained. So much for the bad historical incorrectness i hope.I don't think the movie was set out to be totally historically correct, if possible at all due to new findings, research and postulations, but to give us a glimpse of what the world was like back then. How people interacted, the possible origin of language, how tribes could have interacted (apart from if a certain hominid was there or not) and to show us how much we still look like those apes-with-a-new-brain and how much we changed due to language, cultural evolution, philosophy, science and the machines we made.You shouldn't look with with our modern day morality. In prehistory, rape doesn't exist, nor does murder. It is just mating and killing. Morality only comes with intellect.Im so thrilled of seeing it again after 25 years.PartII Saw it again and it's still interesting to see a movie about our roots, without any understandable dialog. I won't make a late career in linguistics, cause all i could figure out was that 'Atre' probably means fire. Yes, there are some flaws in historical accuracy; A very early hominid together with homo sapiens sapiens is very unlikely to say the least (and even if so, homo sapiens sapiens would have had the advantage in size and intellect), but if i look past that and imagine that was just another late homo species, or tribe, OK. Other issues It is unlikely that a group would launch an all out attack on another, having half the group killed for sure, in a setting where there is no environment pressure. It is very unlikely that hominids belonging to the same group and over relatively short distances would have so much difference in culture (refering to the homo sapiens sapiens groups). It is much more likely that they conquer the earth and undergo minor variations over short distances and some bigger over vast distances, also in time. The difference here is 'continental', not regional. The more advanced group resembles still existing tribes in Africa. Due to harsh circumstances intellect was more driven in northern regions (eurasia), opposed to Africa. The 1980 idea about Neanderthals was pretty off, they weren't as savage as depicted here, that is, the others were no less savage. They may have looked more stupid with a less flat face and lower forehead, but had a larger brain (still they didn't make it up to modern time).The quest for fire is somewhat unlikely, but not impossible.The development of language is interestingly put. It is obvious we didn't start out with an alphabet, as stand up comedians, debaters, or poets. So the Uh's and Ah's make sense, we probably developed language from emotional verbal outings such as yawns, shrieks, sighs, and so on. Of course the most important things would be named first. I think the movie reflects this pretty well. The thing i wonder about is the rate language would introduce itself. The potential intellect in homo sapiens sapiens was no other than the potential we have now, there were no physical obstructions, so it seems likely to me that once language kicks in, it will evolve tremendously fast.(some years) Very interesting to see man on the brink of cultural evolution.Cinematography Very nice. Music Not good. I found it disturbing at times. It is recognizable 1970-80's and i would love to see the movie again without music.Sexual acts That's a flaw. This is depicted in an almost feminist way. It is very unlikely that the caveman cared for the sexual pleasure of his 'mate'. Even today there are many cultures where the male just takes the female.Love Another flaw i'm afraid. Again, even today love is questionable. Nomadic people are usually not monogamous. This only set in after we went farming, for investment reasons. The whole concept of monogamous love found it's high tide a few centuries ago and has been declining since. It is very unlikely that a caveman went back for his 'love'.Humor Dropping a small stone on someone's head is even considered funny today (but not nice), so yes.Acting Good job.I could go on, about social structures, the missing missing teeth, and more, but enough said. Ill stick to the 8 rating, cause it could be done better, but it is surely worth a view and a must if you are interested in our roots.

Pathetic.I thought the story itself is/was powerful. Primarily the constant changes in the scenery was distracting as were smaller or bigger absurdities throughout the movie.I'd personally been very cautious about portraying sexual behavior in such a way. Tribes are bound to have a pecking order, particularly when it comes to mating. Such a casual way of raping at will would probably have been a big no-no that right is reserved for a chief or chiefs and would in effect require their consent or facing their (=basically the whole tribe's) wrath. Punishment by death springs to my mind without much effort...I dunno. Painting cave men as walking penises just runs against the common logic. When it comes to your own tribe - that is. When you are out and about, it's always a different story. Even still.I can't help but feel that gratuitous sex scenes and most of the times bare female body of a leading lady were planted for the interest of an average guy (Annaud, including). Men who trashed the film apart from previous reasons, seem to indicate that the target was met.But seriously, if you can sharpen your choice of weapon, you certainly can come up with a rudimentary defense system for your own (not to mention your tribe's) protection (other than just a lone watchman).Frankly, the film is just too damn inaccurate for its own good.

When their fire went out, they had to steal it from others or find it from natural ignition. Clans battled each other for possession of fire. Many lives were lost. Even rivalry from within the central clan over who would get the glory for finding fire lead to deaths. And most of the women were without adequate clothing, at least so say the producers and writers.The movie started out speaking to evolution which was the first invasion of His expectations of us. Very soon into the movie, group partial nudity appeared as the camera panned over the sleeping clan. Within minutes the nudity started full bore with a rear view of three women leaning forward from the hip to access a creek -- with nothing covering their backsides. Then, the first of five instances of sexual intercourse happened. As this was happening, extreme violence by killings in war over possession of fire and women began. One example of the violence was a spear thrust into the mouth of an attacker, protruding out the back of his head. Then a mother bear minced one of the clansmen as the he tried to hide with a precious taxi of fire. Then the aftermath of the battle was presented as body parts, bloody bodies, and all manner of battle gore filled the screen. And as part of the aftermath, animals were seen eating human remains while visciously protecting their finds. This was the first 14 minutes of the 96-minute movie.Over the rest of the movie, the violence continued as did the nudity 46+ instances of partial nudity (including three youth) and 39+ instances of full nudity, including during the five episodes of sexual intercourse (four animalistic and one sensual). The exact total of instances of nudity was not countable since several scenes involved multiple nudity. And Rae Dawn Chong spent most of her onscreen time without any clothes or with partial clothing.This movie included cannibalism and killing with arrows, stones, sticks, and whatever else was available.
