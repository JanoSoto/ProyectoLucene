Other examples of the genre would be END OF DAYS and LOST SOULS. Both of which are good. BLESS THE CHILD is not better than these two films and it is not worse either. It is just the same. Maggie (Kim Basinger) lives with her sister's daughter, Cody (Holliston Coleman). When Cody gets discovers that she has special powers and abilities, she is targeted by a cult led by her sister's fiance, Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell). With the help of a gothic cult follower (Christina Ricci) that is willing to help her, Maggie must stop the cult from using Cody's powers for their ultimate goal...use them to summon the Devil.Now, this is a cool movie. Not too much action, but some. A little bit of horror thrown in for good measure, and some thrilling sequences- and you got a good movie. See this film, if you are a fan of the genre. Otherwise, you probably won't like it that much. But, otherwise, this is one thrill-ride of a film! BLESS THE CHILD 5/5.

And I have been writing novels for nearly 30 years, with 38 published thus far. One of my favorite genres as a moviegoer is the horror thriller, which is one in which I have written also, usually within a Christian context.BLESS THE CHILD is unquestionably one of the finest genre movies I have ever seen, the kind that combine Christian themes and thriller techniques. I like it because it is relatively subdued, with sincere underplayed acting, and a minimum of Hollywood hocus-pocus.The themes are1) The triumph of God over the devil, instead of the reverse. 2) The power of prayer. 3) The depiction of angels of light. 4) Brief but effective moments when demonic creatures, normally in an unseen supernatural existence, are revealed starkly. 5) No attempt to make evil seem other than loathsome, destructive. 6) Child-like faith enables us to resist Satan.The direction by Chuck Russell was excellent, involving; no wonder he came close to directing the screen version of THIS PRESENT DARKNESS. There was almost no foul language, and the brutal episodes were less in number than usual.I notice the Christian moments were referred to as propaganda. Why is it propaganda when biblical references are used but not propaganda when humanism, nihilism, abortion, homosexuality, adultery and such are similarly promoted?I showed BLESS THE CHILD to a neighbor couple, folks who are not especially religious. They were enthralled by it, reacting nervously when the suspense is intensified, rejoicing at the more inspiring moments.BLESS THE CHILD is not a toweringly great movie but, rather, an intensely reverent one, directed with intelligence, acted with conviction, without nude scenes, and thankfully lacking a tidal wave of vulgarity,Roger Elwood  "},{"Title":"Someone should have blessed this movie.","Date":"21 May 2003","Score":"20 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Horror","Review":" Rated R Runtime 107mins Release Date 2000For Maggie O'Connor a surprise visit from her sister meant much more than catching up on old times. Maggie's sister, being to strung out and confused to do anything more than act crazed, leaves Maggie with something she herself could not conceive, a beautiful baby girl. What Maggie and the rest of the world don't yet know but will find out, is that this baby girl is something even more special than they could ever possibly begin to imagine.Bless the Child stars the beautiful Kim Bassinger as Maggie O'Connor, a single New York native whose world is completely changed when her long lost younger sister comes to pay her a surprise visit. Maggie's sister has also brought along her daughter Cody, who is seemingly just a beautiful baby girl. But confused and addicted to heroin, Maggie's sister leaves Cody in Maggie's protection. So for the next seven years Maggie raises Cody as her own daughter but finds out that this little girl isn't like most little girls. For instance she has the ability to make things move with her mind and has an unexplainable healing touch. But Maggie isn't the only person who knows that Cody is special, as a matter of fact there has been an underground occult group that have been looking for someone like Cody for the past seven years, believing her to be the savior or destruction of mankind. Eventually they find Cody, and coincidentally at the same time Cody's mother shows up again, clean and sober and married to a famous author and child enthusiast, Eric Stark (an always awesome Rufus Sewell), who isn't quite what he seems. Cody's mother and Stark want Cody back and they will stop at nothing, including kidnapping, to do so. But along to help Maggie get Cody back is special Agent Travis (Jimmy Smits), an expert in the occult field who has been tracking the people that have been looking for Cody for the past seven years. Together the two will travel through hell on earth to get this extraordinary child back.I'll start off by saying at least this film was much better and had many more thrills than the almost simultaneously released Lost Souls. There are some solid performances by the leads, especially Bassinger, whose acting, much like her beauty, just seems to keep improving with age. Sewell was also notable in his genuinely creepy role as Stark, and has been near the top of my actors list since I first saw him in the astonishing Dark City. I have to give them and Smits kudos because even when the movie starts to drag at least they can be counted on to keep the film worth watching.Director Chuck Russell makes a good attempt to throw in horror and chills at the right moments and even throws in some great effects such as the Devil's manifestation in to a throne and even a rolling head for fans of a little gore. Also worth mentioning are some genuinely touching scenes added in especially one in which Cody is in the hospital and gives a dying woman a hug and some very kind words. Russell is a good director who has a bright future ahead but he has to learn how to fill in the middle with as much substance as the beginning and end, because I must admit the movie does start to get a little repetitive. Screenplay writers Tom Rickman and Clifford and Ellen Green do a solid job of adapting Cathy Cash Spellman's interesting novel to the big screen. However the storyline is very evident as a cross between Rosemary's Baby and The Omen, which can plainly be seen as a slight lack of originality.Bless the child is a well crafted horror film with some strong aspects and a great feel, but like so many movies adapted from books there is a little too much talk and not quite enough horror. I do, however, recommend this film because the good qualities do outweigh the bad, and it is one of the better horrors in recent release. Leaving it up to a choice though, you can either go out and watch Winona Ryder bore up Lost Souls, or you can sit back and enjoy beautiful Kim Bassinger Bless the Child.Overall Rating 6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Great supernatural ride","Date":"17 December 2002","Score":"16 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Horror","Review":"  Kim Basinger is great in this, great good vs evil, every good deed is high lighted.

So, we decided to see it the Friday it came out.  But, when we walked out of the theater, we were laughing our heads off because of how dumb the movie was. First, the plot was not believable, did not move along smoothly, and was generally boring.  Yes, the leads act really well, but the plot made them look like chickens running around with their heads off. Second, the effects were mediocre.  Although, I did not expect much in the ways of effects in the movie, this was pretty bad.  Have you ever seen someone trying to kill someone else with a butter knife?!  I have, in this movie! Thirdly, almost the entire preview was spent on Christina Ricci's role. But the length of her on-screen in the movie is equal to the amount of time she is in the trailer.  Her role could easily be filled by an extra!  Her role had no challenge, hardly any lines and hardly any effect on the movie. So, if you want a good laugh at a stupid, it's-been-done movie, or if you have nothing better to do, see Bless The Child.  If not, you would be as disappointed as my friends and I were.

As the opening credits roll, its wonderful atmospheric start with its close-up night time shots of New York's gargoyles brings back memories of the great vampire movie Queen of the Damned (2002) and its visual introduction to its narrative.With the arrival of The Star of Yacov, better known as The Christmas Star, once more in some two thousand years, we see childless Maggie O'Connor (Kim Basinger) taking on her younger sisters new born baby Cody, as Cody is dumped on her door step, this elder sister, this wise mature woman and now surrogate mother takes on full responsibility. Myth has it too that Saint Margaret the Virgin is known to be the Patron Saint of Pregnancy, and who, as legend would have it, was brought up by a nurse after her father disowned her, and having once met with the devil, with him in the form of a dragon. Irony and coincidence perhaps for both, considering her name being Maggie and her inability to have children and baby Cody's circumstance.Dealing with this child and her seemingly autistic state, autism being a condition that is caused by a disorder that prevents the brain developing properly, this in turn can impair interaction both socially and emotionally. It isn't until she reaches six years of age that Maggie's worries slowly turn into fears of what exactly is wrong with this exceptional child. There are more than just physical and mental states at play here that are more than concerning and enlightening. Maggie's doubts and fears are soon to be tested, to and far beyond the boundaries of human restraint.Bless the Child uses fables and myth to bring old legends to contemporary settings. With the killing of the innocent children to flush out the Prophecy, the way in which we see this being done is very subtle and coaxing, if a little disturbing, bringing an uncomfortable reality that something sinister, something malevolent, something lurking in the shadows and something extremely evil is all to ready to pounce. Here lies the winning formula, the evil that we see is not so much dark forces of the underworld, but be warned, they exist here too, it is more the evil of man and his willingness to be lead and be controlled by them. Man against man, sin against morality and the age-old battle of Light against the Darkness. We see Eric Stark and his followers taking parallel lines in the similar vain as the real life Satan and occult master Aleister The Beast Crowley (1875 - 1947), founder of The Golden Dawn, and once labelled The Wickedest Man in the World. With Eric Stark renaming his cult The New Dawn Foundation, it is he who most certainly carries this trade of old evils and new Beasts to a tee. English born Rufus Sewell plays Stark with convincing zeal, with both phoney exterior compassion and charm to literally devil-may-care cold indifference, intermingling both persona's well enough to know that we are dealing with more than just the basic human traits that we see, hear and deal with in life. Evil, as it seems holds no bounds.Kim Basinger and Holliston Coleman (born 1992) bond very well, and a great performance as surrogate mother, she plays her role with devotion and with an honest and convincing feel. With just three years after winning her Best Actress in a Supporting Role for L.A. Confidential, this isn't Ms. Basinger going down a peg but raising the stakes in this thriller horror movie genre. Her integrity is most certainly kept in tact, and this is with the assistance of one Chuck Russell, director of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors (1987), The Blob (1988), The Mask (1994) and The Scorpion King (2002). A fine team they make, and as with the gelling of the two leading ladies, it is his fine work in crafting young Holliston Coleman to a standard of high-end child acting. Expect to see more of this young girl. Especially, if she were to take the good advice from the ever professional and independently versatile actress Christina Ricci as the heroin addict Cheri Post, which is always a pleasure to see her working.Bless the child also has its own parallels too, and lends itself to the likes of The Omen (1976), The Exorcist (1973) and the 1968 Roman Polanski film Rosemary's Baby, where we see children as axis of evils', Bless the Child sees the innocence and purity that is The Child; untainted and undemanding. Thus bearing the special gift of Life and the blessing of Divinity, sometimes disturbing, but slight, and at times touching, but never over demanding and horrific, which sets this movie of as being different and a little unique.With moderate violence and with the help of a little CGI, a script that fights its own ground when in the amphitheatres of right and wrong, excellent and well cast, we can then be assured that Bless the Child most certainly has not been cursed.

I have to admit that when this movie came to theatres, it was one of the few times that negative reviews kept me from seeing a movie. After watching the DVD last night, I was kicking myself for missing a chance to see this movie a year earlier.Bless the child is full of new or unknown actors, but reguardless it is well acted... Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits both play their parts well and the script and their acting allows the viewer to see something that may be chemistry building between the two, but doesn't throw it in our faces. The problem with most movies of this type is that the villian is flat and poorly acted... That is not the case in Bless the Child. Rufus Sewell does an excellent job portraying the evil Eric Stark. Although she has a nominal part in the movie, Angela Bettis played the part of Maggies drug-addicted sister so well, I was absolutely hating her. Even with all of this, the movie would not be what it is without the superb acting of Holliston Coleman who plays 6-year-old Cody. At 7, Holliston has more ability than many adult actors. She definately has a future.The story and directing were both done well. Although it is not the most original story line, it is done a different way. Rarely, if ever, is the force of good allowed to manifest itself in a visible presence. In Bless the Child, however, the good can be seen along with the evil. Although I not by any means a very religious person, this struck a cord with me. There's a sense of hope within this growing evil... The world may just have a chance, not because a big guy with a big gun blew away Satan... no, because there is good out there. The battle between good and evil does have two sides... It's just nice to be able to see the good for a change.The special effects are also good in this movie. It is by far a special effects movie, but they are used in a smart fashion to provide a glimpse at the battle that goes on all around us, although we don't see it... Only the rat bedroom sequence left me somewhat disappointed, the rest provided a eery mood to the film.Bless the Child is a great film for what it is and maybe be known as the starting point to the great career of Holliston Coleman. 8/10Although it may not be a perfect movie,  "},{"Title":"Not that bad","Date":"16 April 2001","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Horror","Review":"  If I had only read the reviews written in this forum I would have thought this movie was another Kevin Costner or John Travolta fiasco. Never have I seen so much intense negative interest in a really bad movie.Before watching Bless The Child tonight, my only prior knowledge of it was seeing the trailer a couple of times on TV when the movie was about to be released. And then I only really noticed because the Icon label attached to it seemed to be out of place.But the movie really wasn't that bad, though it could have used more (much more) focus and better lines and more intensity from the lead actors.The story is classic good vrs. evil. What seems to have peeved many of the reviewers is that good, in the form of a little girl (Holliston Coleman), was actually presented as having some real (and quiet) strength for a change. I suppose, in these reviewers jaded view of reality, this seems unrealistic. Besides, in horror movies (you know, the realistic kind) the evil thingamabob is always indestructible and just when good manages to triumph -- we find it really didn't. (How dare the Bless the Child producers have the gall not to be cliche in this respect!)So to sum up my feelings. I liked the story (I don't suffer from anti-Catholic bigotry so the charge of being too Catholic wasn't a concern). I liked the little girl's acting. I thought Kim Bassinger did a credible job -- though her part lacked some intensity as did Jimmie Smits' part. I thought the Stark character (acted by Rufus Sewell) was well acted and convincingly evil. Miss Ricci's cameo was well done and the special effects were very good. Overall, taking into account my earlier criticism of lack of focus, lack of intensity and a few lines that made me wince -- it was not a bad movie. I would suggest it for those who *do* like a clear cut distinction between good and evil. And, oh yes. No nudity. Very little profanity and violence that was intense but not overly graphic or gory.

However in this case, I watched Bless the Child again without remembering that I'd already seen it like a decade ago. Good thing though, as I didn't really remember all that much about it.I must say I enjoyed watching this film, as the story really managed to be both compelling and moving. As a PG-13 Occult/Supernatural sub-genre, it really managed to outdo itself. Now I'm a Jew, and not really religious, but my family is traditional so I've always had an open mind about religion based films. I've always been a fan of Exorcism-Horror films. In this case, Bless the Child really managed to speak to my inner child. The child born on the same day as Christ, possessing telekinetic and healing abilities, battling a Satanic cult - all very nice. I even liked the utopia-like miracles and the slightly tacky visual effects of the angels and the demons. I believe anyone with an open mind could really enjoy this film. Even if they're completely non-religious - they could enjoy it as a Disney style fantasy.Another bonus in this film was the cast, which was a real clash of titans! The lovely Kim Basinger in the middle of her career, my favorite female actress Angela Bettis acting her usual Neurotic character, Christina Ricci in one of her first serious roles since The Addams... all fit together beautifully!Now, for the much called for criticism against the contemporary self- indulging religious messages in the film... unfortunate, but true... The imply that Amy's life had been empty and dull before a miracle child landed in her life and brought her back to her catholic upbringing. The imply that not believing in God automatically sides one with Satan. The imply that teenagers at risk, living hood lives and doing drugs are minions of Satan (and by mere coincidence, of course, have dyed hair and black clothes). The imply that prayer leads to a miracle per request. All these were not at all subtle, and not at all called for. I could easily see how such Easter eggs in a film could ruin it for people who just happen to observe religion in a slightly different way than the film portrayed.However, seeing as how I'm just as capable of enjoying a film with Christian morals as one with Mayan/Asgardian morals - I personally did not find it to be a problem. I place this film with The Neverending Story and Hook, only slightly more serious and maybe slightly scarier for kids.

Maggie brought her up and she soon discovered that Cody had ADHD. And 3 years later, she had amazing abilities. For example, she could spin a bowl lid, spin a doll's car, make the snow in the paperweight move about, healed a pigeon, magically lit the candles in the church one by one, etc.When Cody's babysitter, Maria (Anne Betancourt) said to Cody, if she prayed, good things would happen. On the following day, a child named Martin (Nicholas Marti Salgo) was kidnapped and found later at the bottom of the lake by police with a symbol of the devil on him! And soon, a girl named Cheri (Christina Ricci)ended up in Maggie doctor room. Cheri said that her friends wanted her to end up in a morgue because , she wanted to quit her club! She saw a vision that they were going to get the girl and she said to Maggie that she must NOT let them get the girl.It was fascinating to hear what that satanic symbol symbolized. According to John Travis, the symbol was used in Ceremonial Sacrifices in the 16th century in Europe. The top symbolized Satanism because the fallen angel mythology was taken seriously. The crimes were against God and all the victims' bodies had the symbols which meant Like Easter. What ever a man was up to on Easter's Eve. And on the following day, Cody and Maggie bumped into Jenna and her new husband Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), a master of evil who kidnapped Cody.After the incident, Cheri called and said she knew where Cody was. Cheri also told Maggie that Eric believed in the Devil and he was the one who always killing the kids on the 16th of December who were 6 years of age. He would put them through a test and if they failed, he would kill them. And Eric had been looking for Cody all along and he wanted to change her. Just to make her look like him! So he could use her power. And if Eric couldn't turn Cody into what he wanted her to be, he would kill her because she lead people to God! And on the same night, FREAKS came after Cheri! And when Maggie tried to call the cops, she was given an injection and she felt weary . And as the gang beat Cheri up in the train station, evil creatures were seen flying about. And when Maggie touched Cheri, CHERIS HEAD FELL OFF!!! On the following day, Maggie found out where Eric stayed. Freaky to see demons flying around his lair. The nastiest killer that Eric had was named Stuart (Eugene Lipinski). And pretty creepy to Eric's odd looking eye. And also when Eric strangely removed bullets from Maggie's gun when she tried to shoot him. And she was knocked out by Stuart! And when she woke up, she was swerving past every car on Brooklyn Bridge and she crashed on the edge. And she was thankfully rescued when the car was going off the edge of the bridge.And that night, Eric tempted a hobo (Dwaine McLean) with gas and matches through a Satanic practice. It was stopped when Cody said to the hobo that the Loed had not forgotten him and when the hobo opened his hand, a rosary was in it. And when Cody left, ERIC DROPPED A LIGHTER AND THE HOBO WENT ON FIRE! And then, Eric fooled Cody by becoming a Satanist if she did not believe in God, she must jump.And soon, Travis uncovered Eric's tracks. And when Maggie and Cody were escaping from Eric's helper Dahyna (Dimitra Arliss). And once they got in, DAYHNA APPEARED AND WHEN SHE SMACKED THE WINDOW, SHE TURNED INTO A HIDEOUS DEMON! When Cody and Maggie went 30 miles South of Albany, they crashed and when Maggie told Codie to get out and run, Cody was caught by a limo and she was taken to an Old Estate, North of Albany. And back at Eric's house, under some kind of vision; The Forensic Detectives discovered Satanic symbols in pinkish-purple liquid. And at the Old Estate, Eric told Cody to join them if she wanted to live and her mother said, she should. And then, she made all the plates on the dinner table spin.And when Maggie and Travis came over , Maggie saw Cody running away with a Voodoo group coming after her. And suddenly, one of them attacked Travis!Maggie followed Cody to a demonic church with demonic creatures flying around it. Abd when Maggie approached Cody, she hissed at her and the Voodoo group took Maggie into the Satanic church. And when everyone was inside, rats appeared and they flooded onto a thrown which everyone was facing and the Devil appeared and then evaporated.Back at the church, Sister Joseph (Helen Stenborg) prayed at the convent. Cody was sitting on a table with Stuart holding a knife to her throat. And then, gas bombs broke in and Maggie stabbed Eric. And when Maggie tried to rescue Cody, she was shot by Eric and Cody healed her and angels appeared. And cops broke in, Travis shot Eric and he died, Stuart was shot and the angels disappeared. Maggie rescued Jenna , the church burnt down and everyone got out.In the end, Jenna was in ReHab and she told Maggie to adopt Cody. And suddenly, one of the evil helpers appeared, whipped out a knife while they were looking at the church, Cody then turned around, stared at him, the evil helper stopped and he ran away! WOW!!!

Kim Basinger is the whitebread protagonist, and the side of the angels has never looked so boring.What makes great horror really work is it's distortion and magnification of the dark things residing in the back of our minds that we often refuse to acknowledge.

The basic plot could have been salvaged by writing dialogue that didn't sound like a cross between a Movie of the Week and a soap opera. The details, however, seem to have no impact on the direction of the story each scene makes some sense in itself, but most make very little sense when viewed as part of a whole. Characters come and go at random - one minute Christina Ricci is there, the next she isn't. Every character is one-dimensional and none of the acting convinced me in the least. It seems like each actor was given a single facial expression to use throughout the whole film.One scene involving Basinger's character asleep at her computer epitomized the made-for-TV nature of this movie for me... it starts out spooky enough, but then the writer destroys it by turning it into something you'd see on a sitcom.I got enough Mystery Science Theater-style entertainment from this movie that I don't regret paying $3.75 for it, but I would kick myself if I'd seen it in the evening.

In other words, Christians (especially Roman Catholics and Jesuits) are always good guys whereas the personification of evil will tend to be linked with new age philosophy and the devil will speak with a sort of Moroccan or middle-eastern accent that is displays a prejudice towards Islam. On the prejudice scale, we see Buddhists (as long as they are not new age) get a fairly easy ride, whereas Hindus (probably because of the visual similarity between some of their gods and the depiction of gargoyles) are linked with evil.

Yet no matter what, I can't think of a single positive thing to say about this movie. I know it hasn't been a particularly good time for movies as of late (as opposed to 1999, which was sheer bliss for a movie lover), but Bless the Child is lacking and scraping the barrel even more modern blockbusters. Rehashing the same tired clichés that popped up in the likes of STIGMATA and END OF DAYS to exploit the pre-millenial tension, BLESS THE CHILD is yet another film that offers nothing new to the genre with a weak plot that is predictable at every twist and turn, pointless scenes of action which add nothing to the story, and a dragging pace that makes the hour-and-a-half seem boring even when the film is pretty short for a modern cinema flick.It's hard to even call this a horror film as there are about three scenes of real horror and a couple of dodgy moments of special effects, otherwise it's more of a thriller story onto which the supernatural elements have been clumsily grafted. Sure, there are a few unexpected moments, but 99% of this film is run-of-the-mill fare. One such moment comes when the ever-weird Christina Ricci gets decapitated on a subway station by a gang of crazed Satanic thugs. There's something you don't see every day, which may be worth the value of seeing the movie alone. The film also seems bizarrely obsessed with showing people getting hit by cars and thrown into the air - not once does this happen, but twice, both done in exactly the same way. The first time was shocking, the second time just a pathetic repeat and expected.It's hard to believe that Kim Basinger was receiving an Oscar only a few years before this movie. What happened? Here she's wooden, unconvincing as the would-be mother, an inactive and frankly dumb heroine who causes more trouble than she's worth. I hate the recent influx of films centred around child characters and this is no exception. Holliston Coleman is irritating and far from cute as the central autistic kid, her sole acting talent being to scrunch up her face to display some emotion or other.Rufus Sewell (with his exceptionally creepy eyes) is well-cast as the smooth-talking villain, but he seems nonthreatening and his character underdeveloped. He doesn't get much chance to shine or show anger or hatred. Aside from Christina Ricci's cameo, Ian Holm pops up as a wheelchair-bound purveyor of good in one of his numerous instant take the paycheque and run cameo appearances, and Jimmy Smits - by far the most convincing and likable character in the movie - is wasted in support as an investigating cop whose character bears more than a nod to Fox Mulder.All of the clichéd supernatural effects are present and correct, from candles mysteriously lighting themselves to a swarm of rats and weird demon bats circling in the skies, to black-clad Satanists running around on a mission of destruction. A shot of an undeveloped character getting knitting needles shoved into his eye sockets just seems gratuitous and unnecessary. The CGI effects are cheap-looking and very poor, whether it be the rubbishy demon bats (already used up in BLADE) or the swarm of rats (STUART LITTLE this ain't!), or the horned demons which briefly make their unwelcome appearances.

Jimmy Smitts investigating FBI agent doesn't seem overly concerned or have any urgency about the fact that young kids are being kidnapped and turning up dead,and Bassinger just doesn't show her character any conviction to be believable.If anything,what really lets this movie down is the particularly bad special effects (just see the rats and you'll know what I mean).The movie could have probably done without them.I can look past average acting and overly familiar plots,but bad effects stick out a mile and do this movie no favours.

A little girl with awe-inspiring abilities is raised by her aunt, Maggie O'Connor (Kim Basinger), because her mother is a drug addict (Angela Bettis). The latter hooks up with a weird cult, led by the arrogant Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), and they want the child for diabolical purposes.This is no low-budget production as it cost $40 million to make and was directed by Chuck Russell, who's known for a few fairly significant movies, like Nightmare on Elm Street 3 The Dream Warriors, the remake of The Blob and 1994's highly successful The Mask. Despite this, Bless the Child strangely comes across as a Lifetime movie with a higher budget. In other words, it somehow lacks the sheen and pizazz of an expensive production, which explains the film's mediocre ratings.While I understand this criticism I was able to enter into the world of the characters and enjoy the movie. It's not technically as good as The Omen (and some would say that it's sacrilege to even compare them), but I personally prefer Bless the Child simply because I like the story, characters and themes better, despite the film's limitations.Concerning the cast Kim Basinger was past her physical prime, but she still looks good and she's a likable and compassionate protagonist. Jimmy Smits co-stars as the detective on the case and he's effective, as always. Cutie Christina Ricci shines in a small role as a runaway who tries to help Maggie.

Her life revolves around her job as a nurse at a busy New York hospital, until one rainy night, her sister Jenna abandons her newborn, autistic daughter at her home.Maggie takes the baby in, and she becomes the daughter she never had.Six years later Jenna suddenly re-appears with a mysterious new husband, Eric, and abducts Cody.Despite the fact that Maggie has no legal rights to Cody, FBI agent John Travis, an expert in ritual homicide and occult-related crime, takes up her cause when he realises that Cody shares the same birth date as several other recently missing children.The little girl, it soon becomes clear, manifests extraordinary powers that the forces of evil have waited centuries to control, and her abduction sparks a clash between the soldiers of good and evil.....released around the same time as End of days and Stigmata, this film relies on nothing more than shock tactics, not that bad CGI and Christina Riccis head coming off.Basinger isn't that good in her role, she can't really do anguish, and is upstaged by a wonderfully over the top Sewell. halfway through the movie, we realise that angels are helping her, and this is when it all becomes too silly for it's own good.There are some scenes that defy belief, like when she wakes up in a moving car, and the final act where the 'communion' is taking place, which is packed to the rafters from Lost boy rejects from Spielbergs 'Hook'.Nut it's cheesy in a good way,and there is some good support from Smits, but this is nothing new, and Schwarzeneggar had a much better time defeating the devil.

At 1hr 38mins, it is a good 35 minutes shorter than the average film nowadays, and this, while making it a shorter (and therefore more palatable...???logic???) for the punters, the film was unable to do justice to the themes and characters it created.2 The common fallacy among films that deal with themes of world domination and conquest.  Why America, and more specifically, why New York?  Why was the child born in America, and why was the bad guy looking in New York for it?  Surely if (as the casting implies) the child is the product of the stereotypical inbred mutant hicks (complete with red hair and feckles a la Carrie, 1976...also The Gift, 2000) of Southern US, then why New York and not Smallsville Texas?  These kind of issues are completely ignored, and indeed MUST be in a film this short.3 Bad guy.  It is either an amazing co-incidence that he found and married the mother, or there was some force that brought her to him.  Does he marry all drugged out homeless people? Or does he think the best place to look for mothers of children born on the special date is in rehab centres?  Again, undealt with.  Does he have supernatural powers or not?  How come he can cast a spell to make a guy want to commit suicide, and yet can be simply killed with a few lead pellets?  Earlier in the movie he manages to magic the bullets out of Kim's gun - why couldn't he do it with the FBI guy? Surely a supernatural guy deserves a supernatural death.4 - What of the nuns? How do they know that Kim is on her way with the child?  We never see her tell them she is on her way.  Also the obligatory FBI agent - when he is told that they have got Cody, he seems to know that Cody has been rescued and her recapture is news to him, yet he is never told in the first place.  When the nuns pray, are we to assume that because there are more of them, God is more likely to hear them, and give a quantitative response?  If they hadn't prayed, would God have just sat back and watched as his new messiah got diced?  If not, then why have the nun-praying scene when there are so many holes undealt with?5 - What of this mysterious Christian anti-occult cult led by Ian Holm?  Why don't they have superpowers like the occult guys?  All they do is get a young guy to drive a car for Kim, and then he dies before the getaway.  Why can't they become angels for a second, like the demon granny does?  That would have been cool.  This sub-plot came accross as just the lets-explain-some-of-the-rules part of the film, which should have come in much earlier.  Then again, they don't stick to their own rules, so I guess it doesnt really matter.It is my guess that the film was an adaptation of a book (these often make too many assumptions) and that there was some psycho reel cutter in the editing room who had shorter is better, shorter is better going round in his head.

Granted, there were a few genuine thrills in the film, but as a whole, this disappointing film parallels the insufficiency of  other failed supernatural thrillers, like the recent End of Days. Angela Bettis gives a creepy and unattractive performance as Jenna, the drug addicted mother of Cody, the blessed child. The scene when Jenna runs out on Cody early in the film, leaving her with Maggie (Kim Basinger) is so badly presented that it gives the illusion that she committed suicide instead of just ran off. The little girl who played Cody as a three year old girl was absolutely adorable, but you have to wonder why such a cute little girl has a terrifying gargoyle just outside her bedroom window. No wonder she's so messed up.While the religious cult trying to utilize Cody's powers for evil is the same old garbage, impressive performances and an interesting subplot save this film from obscurity. Kim Basinger is excellent as Maggie, Cody's aunt and guardian since her ninth day of life, and Jimmy Smits plays the part of the most interesting character in the film &#150; a former seminary student who decided to join the FBI as another way to fight Satan. Well, he gets his chance with the creepy Eric Stark, leader of a group of Satanists who want to utilize Cody's powers for their own purposes. (spoilers) There's nothing new here, and the relationship between Maggie and Cherry ( another good performance from Christina Ricci) is ridiculously unlikely from the beginning, but at least they were both well acted. Also, one of the film's few real thrills involved Cherry, after having been beaten to death in the subway but a bunch of satanic nuts. I don't care what anyone says, the part where Cherry's head rolls off is a great scare! There was another good scare that took place in front of the satanic church, but for the most part, the film was a jumbled mess of clichés. Besides that, it seemed like every five minutes, something stupid would happen. The scene where Maggie bursts into Cody's bedroom after hearing her scream from the other room is taken directly from The Exorcist, especially the part where she bursts through the door with a horrified expression on her face. This is blatant plagiarism, but at least it was followed by a sequence in which dreams and reality are effectively confused with each other, and this scene also makes an amusing comment about slow computers. There is a candlelight scene that is fairly effective, but that is ruined by the old Crying Statue trick, and Cody's dumb line, `She's sad, so sad. She's crying for us.' The return of Cody's mother when Cody is six years old is just weak scriptwriting, and the whole thing with the gargoyles, while impressive as far as the special effects, may have been a little bit excessive. But the worst things were the continuity errors and logical errors. For example, in the scene before Maggie crashes her car and drops it off of the bridge after being saved by some random hero, she wakes up out of a drugged sleep and she's sitting in a moving car heading the wrong way on a busy road. Clearly the bad guys didn't put her in the car and give it a good push, and it's obvious that SHE didn't drive herself there, so what the hell happened? Was the car remote controlled? And how about the scene where Maggie follows Cody as she is led into the dentists office, and when she gets upstairs, the dentist is just finishing? That is truly some lightning speed dental work. Then you have Maggie and Cody being chased into the subway by one of the creepy Satanists, and as she bangs on the subway door, breaking the glass in frustration, her true form, that of some sort of gargoyle, shows momentarily. If she is some type of demon capable of changing forms, why can't she get onto a freakin' subway car? I've complained too much already, I'm not even gonna get started on the mystery of the disappearing police backup.  Bless The Child is a run of the mill supernatural thriller with the ever-present religious undertones (or overtones, in this case). The only really interesting thing about the film is the investigation of the murdered children by the FBI, but we already know who the killers are. As a whole, the film is a mess, and the clichés are everywhere. Even the ending, when some Satanist runs up with a knife to kill Cody (or kill SOMEONE, at least), only to stop abruptly in shock when Cody turns around and looks at him. Yawn. And what better way to end a heavily clichéd film than with one more cliché &#150; `Are you alright?' `It's alright &#150; now.' Even Stigmata was better than this.

In fact, there is little in common between the screenplay and the novel other than the title, and that is a good thing.  The screenplay brings the battle between Good and Evil into much sharper focus than does the book, and dispenses with the book's muddy theology and theosophy.  The portrayals of the child's developing miraculous gifts and visions are little cinematic gems in themselves, and the vision of the weeping statue of St. Mary in the side chapel of the Roman Catholic church is particularly moving. The parallels between the temptations of the child and the three temptations of Christ in the wilderness are elegant theological touches. The portrayal of the gentle and fierce goodness of the child's aunt/foster mother by Kim Basinger are believable and engaging.  This is a movie that most will probably either love or hate.  Viewers who believe in the actual existence of God and Satan and the reality of the ongoing war between Good and Evil will probably love it.  In my opinion, this movie is on a par with the original Exorcist.

If that isn't enough, Cody can even bring dead birds back to life.Such an ability would land most children on the talk show circuit, but it makes Cody a target for the head of a self-help empire that's really a front for...Satan!Such is the premise of Bless the Child, a movie that mixes murder mystery with the occult and supernatural and throws in a Bible's worth of clichés about the Catholic church, new age religion, and devil worship.It's a silly premise which makes it all the more important that the movie's stars, Kim Basinger, Jimmy Smits, Rufus Sewell, and Angela Butts, take their roles very seriously. Gravity is the order of the day as the underdog forces of good are confronted by the seemingly insurmountable power of evil.It all starts nine days after the Star of Jacob shines in the New York sky for the first time in 2000 years. Matronly non-believer Maggie O'Connor, played by Basinger, is stuck with a baby left behind by Jenna, her heroin-addicted sister, played by Butts.On the bright side, it turns out that young Cody, played by Holliston Coleman, has not been born addicted to smack, but the girl is different -- not quite autistic, but not the most communicative little dickens either. Cody is enrolled in a special school for autistic children run by some Catholic nuns and the years go by relatively peacefully.But one day Jenna returns, this time with a newly-married hubby in tow. Eric Stark, played by Sewell, is the said leader of the human potential pyramid scam, and he aims to harness Cody's powers and is not above kidnapping this pint-sized power source.From there the chase begins.Bless The Child has its share of tense moments and suspense, but falls well short of such classics as The Exorcist and The Omen. The camera simply spends too much time on Basinger and not enough on what the fuss is supposed to be all about. Coleman's character comes across as little more than a supernatural cigar-smoking monkey, and Sewell is simply unconvincing as the charismatic leader of a cult.But by the same token, Bless The Child is a far sight better than Armageddon, in which a pathetic Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on a surprisingly wimpy Satan. And other than a rather unnecessary rolling-head scene, the violence is portrayed without the gruesome'n'graphic that plagues many movies these days.

Well even with SFX demons and spiritual visions this is a different kind of movie.  There are strong Christian overtones not indicated in the reviews.  The theme is about keeping faith and persisting in hopeless situations. The casting is good, particularly with Basinger and Sewell, even if the script skims over these archetypical characters.  The story is set up in a rushed, melodramatic manner.  A single doctor (Basinger) is visited by her junkie sister who leaves a newborn in her care and vanishes.  Six years later, sister returns cleaned-up and married to rich, self-reliance cult leader (Sewell), to claim her little girl Cody.  A custody conflict looks imminent, until the FBI investigator and former seminary student (Jimmy Smits) links a recent string of child murders to the cult leader.  From then on it's a back-and-forth battle over Cody, who has some kind of spiritual importance and is being tempted to join the dark side.  Some of these scenes are lifted out of the biblical gospels. The villains at the center of the cult are more clever than the heroes and seem to be everywhere, which maintains some paranoia in the film. The requisite gore, explosions and car chases are kept to a minimum in favor of tense confrontations and close-calls.  There were a few scenes that elicited the necessary horror. The conclusion was too convenient and lacked the irony I enjoy, but the pacing and tension kept me eager to see what would happen next.

The film looks pretty good, and has one or two actual moments in it (I'm thinking of a couple notes of grace the little girl has when she hugs a homeless man and a sick girl), but unless expectations are very low, this will surely disappoint.It's interesting, too, that the script is shot through with authentic Christianity but plays fast and loose with a significant detail according to Scripture, King Herod, attempting to assassinate the child Messiah, has all boys in the kingdom killed who were born within a two-year span.

I did not like Kim Basinger.  (surprise surprise) She can't act (and the girl can't run either). (I didn't believe a single thing she did. She brushed herself off from the rain... it wasn't convincing.) What didn't help matters is that her character was dumb... dumber than dumb. Jimmy Smits' character started off on the right foot. (I liked the idea of an almost-priest turned FBI because he found a different way to fight it.) But his part became pretty dull and worthless. (Oh the part he had towards the end was just stoopied.) Again they put scenes in the movie's previews to incite when that's all there was to it (the evil face by the subway). The music was bad and gimmicky. The camera's slow motion didn't work for me at all.What did I like?  Rufus Sewell did his best to play a fairly decent villain. Christina Ricci's whole two scenes were suitable. Angela Bettis was okay in her role as a drug addict. I liked the child, Cody. I thought she (Holliston Coleman) did exceptionally well. I liked the religious images (both good and evil). It did get a bit cheesy (as buttertree would say) and some parts were fake (but I liked some of those fake parts too). I liked the angels' presence throughout the film. I liked the message The power of prayer. Evil exists. There is a God. We all live with the struggle between good and evil every day. God is with you.The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.

So this movie whether or not it was intended to do so, acts as a recruitment film or more accurately a propaganda film for the Catholic Church. This film has very obvious enemies, including one man, who leads what Christina Ricci calls the opposite of Religion, a cult that is very similar to Scientologist's Dianetics, in image and presentation. The members of the cult, when not in public, wear black clothing and trench coats and otherwise fit the image of the Columbine killers.What makes this film worse is that our main character has visions of flying devils whenever the evil lurks. The special effects are tremendously lame and would make any person who has seen what can be done with modern animation, snort.Thirdly and lastly, all of the heroes are Catholic. The mother of the child, the FBI agent and the child herself. Also the only way they make any progress towards there goal is by praying, not by the investigation process they teach you in FBI school.The movie is tremendously goofy, and lacks any real excitement but did give me a hankering for some wafers and some wine.

I can imagine a convent erupting in cheers at the scene where nuns rally to save the girl-- by organizing a prayer group. It should be an exciting scene, but I'm the wrong audience. My sister, who's very religious and active in her church, would enjoy this film much more.The movie's weak points are the dialogue and character interaction. Despite Kim Basinger's desperation to get the child back, she seems to do everything she can to work AGAINST the agent who wants to help. Some character mood changes come too easily, while others wear a bullseye on their forehead the instant you see them. The good Samaritans, however, were a nice touch, and the subtlety of their characters was welcome.Some abrupt scenes make you wonder what they left on the cutting room floor. One such scene features Ian Holm. Despite His high standing in the credits, it's a cameo-- and his delivery is nothing short of blustery.I'm not a Basinger fan, but I wouldn't replace her or Jimmy Smits. The casting worked. I've read criticism that Basinger's glamorous looks are out of place and Smits's action-poor FBI agent wouldn't work on the NYPD. I can say the first is unjustified, and the second is inaccurate.Christina Ricci-- who I do like-- puts in the worst performance of her career. I've never seen anyone else UNDERact and OVERact in the same scene. Watch how she treats the cigarette in the diner, you'll see what I mean. I could understand if she claimed she just got her script the day of filming.The real reason I went to the movie was Angela Bettis, who had a small role in Girl, Interrupted.

The performances are surprisingly bad, as well, especially Basinger's emotionally distant Maggie, and Ricci's rather pointless turn as the requisite good-hearted yet troubled Goth chick.

Is there some sort of mysticism that Catholicism portrays that's supposed to make it more believable to us?  Personally, I'd like to see a spiritual warfare movie fought by one of those charismatic, snake-throwing Appalachian churches where they actually focus on using spiritual power to overcome evil.  Not some nun who sees a statue of the virgin Mary crying and gets this tingley feeling about her.  I want to see a force come out of a person to fight a spirit, not just see someone running around until they see a bright light that expunges all the demons from the room.According to the Bible, God considered Mary a very holy lady (being a virgin was only part of it) and that's why she was chosen to bear the Messiah.  In Bless the Child we have a very spiritually gifted girl born to a crackwhore.  That in itself wouldn't be so incredulous if the movie attempted to explain why this girl was the chosen one.  But no, we're left hanging.  We're just supposed to watch this girl perform miracles because... that's just the way it is.All the reasons listed above make this picture truly uninteresting.  Sure it's easy to follow, but that can only be accredited to the shallowness of the plot.  I just can't get into a girl with unexplicable powers being tossed around in a custody battle between a confused aunt and a New Age motivational speaker.

Please don't accuse me of spoiling anything - did you really expect anything enlightening or new?  Even a good ending couldn't have saved the movie from being so bad.While movies like The Fallen and Stigmata also had their share of problems, they at least had the guts to venture on their own and become their own movie, explaining in their own way why the spirits acted a certain way.

It seemed like this should be on MST3K.  The movie was one of the worst, yet best horror movies made. It doesn't even care how bad of a movie it is, and doesn't check up on itself.  There is so much to gripe/compliment about it.First, mistakes in the movie.  The movie is set in New York, yet many of the buildings have the word Center spelled Centre.  The movie was, therefore, filmed in Canada.  This is further affirmed by a brief glance of a Maple Leaf on a police car towards the end.  And is cemented in when, at the police station, while looking at a police report, the pages have the word Ontario printed at the top.  This all makes for good laughter, especially when talking to your friend.Next, the plot.  It is basically the plot from End of Days if they tried to kill the girl when she was six.  That movie was awful too.  It has a little bit of The Servants of Twilight mixed in.  So, who can point out that this was an original movie?Also, the child does not do anything.  So can spin plates in self-defense. She doesn't do anything out of anger, the best part of the movie, but she does not even defend herself too much.  However, she does have one bad-a** line in the movie, seen in the trailers.  In response to the order Jump if you believe in God she replies After you.  Great line.**spoilers****Spoilers** Next, Kim Basinger, while a strong role, starts off badly.  She starts by searching out the evil guy's cult.  Then, she e-mails him.  The e-mail is I need to talk about the girl.  Call me.  I mean, who would actually call the mother/aunt of the girl that he just kidnapped, unless they want ransom, which he does not?**Spoilers****Spoilers** Also, how do the nuns know without an explanation the situation exactly? I mean, this saves repetitive explanations, but that could have been avoided also.  The nuns also bring in God's angels with a mass prayer.  That was humorous.**Spoiler** Finally, the cult is a satan-worshiping cult.  Using it, the movie says that all Goths are satanists.  And all atheists who believe in self-empowerment are satanists also.  That was just ridiculous.  It also seemed like it was against Scientology.All in all, the movie was funny, and fun to watch.  As a movie goes, it was horrible, and awful, considering that you knew how everything would end. So, skip it, unless you like doing the MST3K thing.5/10 "},{"Title":"WAY over bashed","Date":"16 August 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Horror","Review":"  Sure this movie isn't perfect, but it is a hell of a lot better than the reviews may lead you to believe.

All she seems to do is hold slight telekenises and sense when the Devil is at hand.  oooh, scary. *slight spoilers ahead*~but anyone with a brain can see them coming halfway through the film.  This is the other thing that was terrible about the movie.  The concept of good and evil was entirely too simplistic.  God, or the Powers of Good, help this little girl at only one juncture, but seem to be absent during the rest of the film.  This emphasized how stereotypical it is.  And the Devil is magically defeated at the end, practically without a fight.  I kept waiting for the rest to take place, but to no avail.  The bright spots were Coleman (the little girl) and a few spare plot twists that managed to keep it interesting.  Too bad Christina Ricci didn't have a bigger part, because she was the best actress in the whole rotten production.  I gave it a 6, simply for nice imagery.

I have never seen Kim Basinger at her best. In fact the only thing I have seen her in besides this movie was her acting debut on an episode of Chalies Angels (it was a good episode though). I just don't really think she is that great an actress. The best way I can express it is that if Kim had been born a man, she would have been born Keanu Reeves.Now onto the movie. The acting was well done, the special effects were spectacular (and they were not depended on, this was not a special effects flick), and the movie did not depend on the actor/actresses fame to bring in the crowds. Christina Ricci is a very good actress, she played her part very well, but it was a very small part, contrary to the way it might seem from the previews. Jimmy Smits, the guy who died a little while back on NYPD Blue if you don't remember him from anything else, played a major role as a FBI agent (i hope the irony isn't lost on you) and gave a very good performance and the little girl (played by Holliston Coleman, a newcomer to movies but some might know her from a TV movie last year called Supreme Sanction) is a very good child actress (something there is a real shortage of in America right now *cough-Anakin-cough*). Rufus Sewell played the lead villain in the movie (you might remember him best from playing the lead in Dark City) and, much like his Dark City performance, he was very powerful and a joy to watch.The movie could best be desribed as Firestarter meets Stigmata. Cody O'Connor (Holliston Coleman) is a child with special powers of a heavenly nature who comes under the eye of satanist Erik Stark (Rufus Sewell). The movie centers around Rufus' attempts at converting Cody for his own purposes and Cody's caretaker and aunt's (Kim Basinger) struggles to get her back.I would highly recommend this movie for people that like a good Theological movie along the flavor of Stigmata or conspiricy movies along the lines of Firestarter.Overall I found little wrong with the movie other than the fact that Ricci had such a small part when I expected a larger one and the fairly wooden actings of Basinger (although, in her defense, she did have a few good emotional scenes).I'd give it a 93 out of 100.

Another loop hole that irritated me was the end chapter where Jimmy Smitts is being attacked and then is let go to run after the imposter child.  If I were a villain I am pretty sure I wouldn't make the same mistake by letting the good guy live to kill me in the end.  Could you get any dumber?

Sitting in a movie theater with my cousins and brothers watching My Stepmother is an Alien, and then Kim Basinger, in all her heavenly glory, rips off her nightie. Right off! I think I may have sprang right there. I mean, probably hyperventilated and everything. Spewed popcorn rows ahead. She was WOMAN. And ever since that moment of my life, I've segued from hardcore crush on Vicki Vale to having a fondness for her, she's like the pretty girl everyone hated. Well, Kim Basinger, you know what? It's your own fault people are mean to you. Or it's your agents. Lady, you've done some good work and you have a pretty well-deserved Oscar to prove it, but usually you pick the DUMBEST movies. While you read a script, do you READ the script? Or do you just think that your Oscar got you whatever you want? You still have to earn it! Why don't you just do a USA original and stick the stake in the heart of your career. And lady, you do look good. You have aged very gracefully. Thank you for making me the horniest ten year-old in America.And, damn it! Let someone else pick your next movie. Bless the Child is so filled with hate and vengeance and every other mean emotion imaginable, not to mention so poorly written, you have to wonder if these people were hired straight from the Unsolved Mysteries re-enactions team. It's also formulaic, absent of any interest in it's own characters and frightfully dull.Bless the Child begins with your usual Christmastime glee. Maggie O'Connor (Basinger) rides the bus home from work, talks to a woman about God, angels, stars, pretty everyday stuff and then mistakes her crackhead sister Jenna (Angela Bettis) for a homeless person. That's because they haven't spoken in two years. The audience gasps with surprise. And Jenna now has a child (hence the title) who is only nine days old. And Maggie is actually surprised to find junkie paraphenilia when she goes through the backpack for diapers. Then she knocks Jenna silly. Maggie is obviously a scapper, a fighter! Duh! That's why we all know when Jenna runs out the door, leaving her new baby daughter with Maggie, stealing the money from Maggie's purse like a coward, that the child is just so much better off now, anyway. Because...that's right, the child is blessed.And this is how the whole movie plays predictably. Except for one beheading, a couple of vehicular homicides, and some computer-generated dream filled with giant, red-eyed rats, this is a run-of-the-mill good vs. evil telemovie rip-off. The most embarassing thing is, everything in this movie was out of place with such strain and effort. It was basic and they had the nerve to make it appear as though they had spent hours on each detail. Is it so basic, actually, that a child, even a non-blessed child, would perfectly understand.I bet this movie, as all movies are, was expensive to make, really. Probably $7 or 8 million for Basinger, who actually isn't that bad in her role, but I do have that fondness, $2 for Jimmy Smits to read his lines like he's pulling from a teleprompter as an FBI agent who, like Maggie, is a non-practicing Catholic.I'd further guess $1-2 million for scenery-chewing ham/villain Rufus Sewell as Eric Stark, a former child star-cum-junkie who turns all satanist and starts a Rediscover Yourself and Flee the Needle Freak Within club or something.  At the same time in his life, Eric begins the crusade to find the child who was born so, blessed, I suppose for lack of a more predictable word. How convenient that mother of such child is a junkie! What inexplicable luck for the villain!**Note to Alanis Morrisette THAT is irony, ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife or a no smoking sign on your cigarette break is bad luck, but And isn't it bad luck, don't ya think? doesn't have that ring to it, I guess.  You could hire these screenwriters to pen your next album. They got the basics down. And I'm sure they're lookin' for work.ANYWAYS...back to the point maybe $1 mil for Christina Ricci in a role that was built to earn some budding actor her SAG card. But every other element of the movie turned it's back on reason, too, so why would the burning question of how such an accomplished young actress got her wasted self into this mess have an answer? Oh, yeah, answer is above one million dollars. Nice work if you can get it.Let's throw in another $5 for Chuck Russell, the director. Some people make him out like some great auteur for some music videos he did in the eighties, a Nightmare on Elm Street movie and Jim Carrey's The Mask. But after seeing Eraser and now Bless the Child, I think he's a wolf in sheep's cloth. He's like Eric Stark. Pretending to be a friend to those in need. Taking in junkies like Jenna, nurturing them, nourishing them. But, all too late, you realize you've been sucked into a little corner of his sick, poorly-written world from which there is no escape.With an additional $10 million in production and extra labor and $10 or 15 in marketing and an extra $10 for a few cool special effects and you've got yourself a little $50-60 million Satan-themed thriller, which are pretty big these days, in case ya hadn't noticed.Well, when those boys that spent all that money sat down and saw where all their money went, I wonder do they realize that they wasted sixty million dollars for me to waste seven?

Unfortunately this project was handed to the wrong people.The plot (if you could call it that) was terrible.  The characters were underdeveloped, the story never really hit on anything interesting, and nothing was explained in detail, making it really hard to get into this movie.  The parts of the movie that were supposed to evoke feelings in the audience just seemed cheap and contrived, because there was no follow up, no big payoff.  It was like a bad TV movie with expensive special effects and big name actors.Even pricey visual effects couldn't make this movie worthwhile.  There were a few scary parts that might make you jump in your seat, and a couple gruesome images that might stick in your head, but that will be the only thing you'll remember about this easily forgettable movie.It's also a real shame that such talents as Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell (who I affectionately call lazy eye), Jimmy Smits, and Christina Ricci were wasted on this undeserving film.  They did what they could with their meager characters, especially Holliston Coleman, who played the child.  Despite very little to work with, she put in a good performance.

The musical score was gorgeous, the special effects creepy or luminous (depending on the scene).  The story was edgy, with a slow unfolding from normal life to being ensnared in a hidden web of evil that keeps you on the edge of your seat and jumping.What makes this film unusual was that while you feel the horror of a fly being slowly wrapped in a sticky evil web, you also get glimpses (but did you see it or not?) that a finger might be moving to bend the web and (maybe) provide an escape... It's a side that's not often shown in a thriller, and it resonated with my own experience of overt evil opposed, if at all, only through tiny faithful decisions based on glimmerings of hope.Basinger and Smits give solid performances, Angela Bettis was absolutely perfect as an edgy, strung-out addict in way over her head.  Sewell makes a great bad guy, with a thin veneer of charm barely covering a menacing black evil.But the real surprise was Holliston Coleman, a kid who was only 6 when this film was cast and turned 7 as filming started.  I didn't think you could get this kind of performance from a kid this young.  Coleman is the Child, so as you might expect she is completely central to the film.  They took a huge risk centering this film on such a young child; the film would not have survived merely a good performance -- it had to be  great, and Holliston Coleman delivered.  The really tough part is that she's locked in her own silent world most of the film (as if she's listening to something we can't hear) -- so she has to convey this huge range of emotions purely in her looks, her eyes, the way she carries her body.

There are some chase scenes and a few fight scenes and a final confrontation at an old church.The general plot line is decent, but some of the acting is terrible. Some of the dialogue is just dumbLike when Basinger pulls a gun on the cult leader and says I've never shot a gun before! Why would she say that?Or when she goes to the police and says her (adopted) daughter has been kidnapped and the stereotypical uncaring police officer blandly says calm down... Really??Iam Holm is in this film, but don't blink because you'll miss him. He plays a wheelchair bound former priest who battles evil cults and tells Basinger about the cult. That's really the extent of his role.If they had made this movie without Basinger and really worked through the plot and took more time with it, this would have been a good film, but as it is...eh, you can find better.

Good Christians will be offended, intelligent people will be annoyed, and horror lovers will be bored. The movie's effectiveness goes only as far as it's having a bit more adrenaline than some of its equally unholy brothers and sisters like the Seventh Sign, the Ninth Gate, and/or Lost Souls. As lame as Bless the Child is, At least it won't put you to sleep. Although anyone who does fall asleep is not gonna miss much. The only people that I can recommend bless the child to are satanists with a sense of humour.Kim Basinger could not act even if her life depended on it, something that the casting director of Bless the Child has not taken into account. Her line delivery here is atrocious, as is the case with pretty much every member of the cast save Jimmy Smits. Indeed Bless the Child is a typical case of people serving the function of chess pawns. They are pure wood, and have but to be moved from here to there by a film maker who doesn't really know how to play. Perhaps it is a lack of talent or money, but Bless the Child doesn't try very hard. There are times when it comes close to being laughable. Take for instance a handful of demons in human form, who kill their chosen victim by beating him/her like the LAPD from twenty years ago. I don't see why morphing back into monster and biting someones head of isn't a more effective method. Perhaps such a creative decision was neglected because Bless the Child lacked convincing effects or was too sissy too enter the red zone. Indeed very little blood gets, spilled in this movie. What little computer graphics there are look way out of date, but they make for some interesting shots. The utterly dopey climax gives us one rendering of Satan (as a beast not a man) unfortunately this version has got nothing on that featured in End of Days made the previous year.Bless the Child is not unwatchable, but it's far from likable. Such a movie as this one, with its blatant silliness, lack of scares, and unoriginality is hard to recommend.

It's all there God, the Devil, Hell and the end of the world as we know it! Seriously, why were all directors and scriptwriters so obsessed with Christianity back in the year 2000? Anyways, Kim Basinger &#150; clearly still recovering from her unexpected success role in L.A. Confidential &#150; stars as the heroine/nurse Maggie whose tiny little universe is all shaken up when her estranged and drug-addicted sister (Angela Bettis) drops off a newborn baby girl and immediately disappears again. Maggie always wanted to have children but couldn't, so she gladly raises little Cody and slowly discovers she's gifted with exceptional powers. Quite ironic, everybody initially thinks Cody is autistic and they even send her to a special school, but turns out she's actually the savior of humanity, so...little mistake there! Meanwhile the miraculously reformed sister returns, accompanied by a satanic cult leader pretending to be a health-guru (Rufus Sewell). Just when you think it can't get any sillier, there's an ex-priest turned copper helping Maggie in her battle for custody. As to be expected, Bless the Child is a pretty lame movie with too many overlong & tedious dialogs and no excitement. Director Chuck Russell tries to evoke some false scares with his sub plot about a child murderer on the loose, but that's all rather pointless. The endless speeches about Good VS. Evil are almost as boring as reading the Bible itself and all the 'homages' to classic horror titles are just irritating & redundant. A diabolical nanny looking exactly like the one in The Omen? Come on... The only really good performance is given by Angela Bettis and the roles of Christina Ricci and veteran actor Ian Holm are not much more than cameos. There's no gore or even any special effects, naturally, apart from two unintentionally hilarious scenes involving fake over-sized CGI rats. Don't watch Bless the Child unless you've never seen any classic religion-themed horror before in your life, so you don't know what you're missing.

Let's take a history lesson shall we? In 1968 an Oscar winning film about a group of devil worshippers trying to take a women's baby way from her was made, it was called Rosemary's Baby. In 1976 Brain De Palma brough us a smash hit with the tale of a tormented teenager with special powers named Carrie. In 1995 David Fincher shocked audiences as he turned Kevin Spacey into a ruthless serial killer in the chilling Seven. Also in 1995 a priest turned cop tries to save a women and her child from the Archangel Gabriel player by Christopher Walking in the very scary Prophecy. In the new millenuim films like End of Days, Stigmata, and Lost Soulds failed at depicting good and evil in Biblical porportions. So with that said I don't see why this film needed to be made. If you have seen at least one of the above listed films there is really no need to see this extremely dumb and totally unbelievable thriller about a cult of satanists who are killing off children until they can find the one they are looking for and turn her against God. But it is up to the childs aunt (Kim Basinger doesn't need to worry about any Oscar nominations here) an a dective who couldn't quite cut it as a priest (can anyone say Prophecy?). The story tries to deal with issues of religion and put all its key players on different levels but relies more on atmosphere than character development. In fact the only character we know anything about is our villian, who isn't that interesting in the first place. The script is unbelievably bad and instead of providing any chills this movie tries so hard to be serious it is downright boring. There is really only three reasons to see this bland thriller 1) Jimmy Smits as the dective, 2) the great special effects and 3) Christina Ricci who's role was much to small.

Bless The Child has the ability to captivate the audience in a way the Omen did not.  This is mainly because of a strong performance by 7 year old Holliston Coleman who plays young Cody one of the central characters and the main driving force behind the story. Holliston, is very believable as the young girl who a satanic cult believes will one day become a saint.  Her charm and beauty easily captures the audiences heart from the moment she first appears on the screen.  Throughout the movie Holli displays a wide range of emotions from sadness to overwelming kindness and a wonderful ability to bring the audience to tears without saying a word. Holli's performance alone is reason enough to see this movie, but she's also backed by a wonderful supporting cast including Jimmmy Smits as an FBI agent skilled in the investigation of occult related crime, Kim Basinger as Cody's aunt who raised her from the time she was a baby, Rufus Sewell who plays the evil cult leader Eric Stark wonderfully I might add, Dimitra Arliss who plays the evil nanny (or the Mary Poppins from hell as many people call her) beautifully.  If you're looking for a typical teen slasher film avoid this movie since even though it's scary it only has two really violet moments. You're not going to see your teenage bimbette running into the woods when she should be calling the police in this one nor are you going to see young Cody start using her powers to burst people into flames ala Carrie (which if they had choose to go that route the movie would have never been good since I don't believe Holli could portray evil she's too sweet and lovable)in this one.

From the robotic actions of every member of the cast to a screenplay that is nothing more than a series of broken puzzle pieces used to justify later action.

Even the New York police are portrayed as bumbling fools who would be lost without the help of Jimmy Smits' character, an FBI agent specializing in the occult and a former seminary student.  Credentials that never become necessary since Maggie continuously avoids help and pursues the occult group on her own.The special effects in the film are even worse as spirits take the shape of glowing lights and a roomful of rats looks like a scene from an animated cartoon.

Not being strongly based in either pro-Christian or pro-Devil worship (For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. - Hamlet, Act III), I want to comment on the movie itself.Director Russell is not a good director of actors.  He doesn't get the best out of them.  Rufus Sewell can be very good if made to dig into himself and perform, here I felt he was just mailing it in.  Kim Basinger is wonderful when reigned in and not allowed to vamp, here she over-emotes to a fault. The other actors seem to just throw their lines in as an afterthought and the director has left them there to rot.The special effects are simplistic and not realistic enough to overcome the unintentional comedy of bad effects (try Plan 9 from Outerspace for a good laugh sometime).  I just couldn't find myself really involved in the outcome of the movie, the climax was much too wooden and staged.That being said, the concept is delicious.  The battle between good and evil and the incarnated child who will lead us to salvation are great themes and are the best reason to see the movie.

This is horrible enough though, and the reason they thought they could get away with it --they HAVE in fact made money -- is because such films have entered the realm of commodity.  What that means is that there are enough premanufactured parts and premanufactured audience perceptions that all it takes is a lesser craftsman to satisfy the formula by simple assembly..Great films can invent parts of society. Commodity films mirror parts of the society that are mature, reducable and thoroughly premarketed. What's depressing about this is that it successfully exists as a commodity. It says that fundamentalists and political consultants have succeeded in reducing the world of many people to the simplest dynamics of good and evil; a simplicity so profound that the mere appearance of code words mitigates the need for a story, for acting, indeed for any cinematic skill whatsoever.If anyone is reading this and considering seeing `Bless,' please don't.

Can the girl's aunt (who is change of her sister's daughter when the sister, a drug addict, left her at the doorstep) save the child? Will evil win? And will I care?Script? Let's see those clichés - pack 'em in. Evil rats? Check! Old wicked nanny figure? Check! Soft-spoken-devil-figure-prone-to-angry-bouts? Check! Black garbed followers? Elite but mysterious group dedicated to God? It's a go! Flat dimensionless characters? We're going. It's all quite dull, and has been done better in many other such movies involving similar themes (`The Devil's Advocate' for one). There's a lack of tension - you know the outcome from the outset and I, quite correctly, picked out those marked for death and those for life. No surprises and lots of `oh whatever'.Acting? I'm not sure why Bassinger selected this script (for the reasons above). Certainly she's the best thing here but she still seems tired and worn throughout the movie (never mind the fact her character often displays the common sense of a congenital idiot).  Rufus Sewell - the force of evil - is the usual smiling, collected, sort that was far better portrayed by Pacino in `The Devil's Advocate' (and even by Gabriel Byrne in the weak `End of Days'). Christina Ricci puts in a nice small role here, but alas she's not on screen long enough for us to enjoy. As to the girl at the centre of the fight, the would-be-pawn of God. she's actually not that great (or at least wasn't created well). She smiles, gives an odd look, is quiet and so forth in an attempt to appear mysterious. I was not buying it, and found the whole act mundane.

Maggie O'Connor (Kim Basinger) is a single woman who was recently left by her husband. Then, on Christmas Eve, her estranged, drug-addicted sister, Jenna (Angela Bettis) shows up with a baby, and ends up disappearing, leaving Maggie to take care of the baby girl, named Cody. As Cody grows older, Maggie notices things about her - like how she seems to be hearing things nobody else can, and has magical healing powers. While a series of child slayings (all children born on a certain date, strangely enough) are occurring in the city, Jenna resurfaces out of the blue with a husband, Eric (Rufus Sewell), a leader of a cult-like religion, and the two demand Maggie to give Cody back to them. A mysterious girl with a connection to Eric and his cult of Devil-worshipping followers, Cheri (Christina Ricci) reveals more about their intentions to Maggie, but ends up murdered by the cult after she tries to leave. Now it's up to Maggie to stop the cult from initiating (or killing) Cody, in a battle of good versus evil.Very suspenseful and nicely written, Bless The Child is an interesting and refreshing take on a story that has been done many times before. Similar to The Omen in some ways, but also quite different, the story is a very interesting one at that, and kept my interest the entire way through. There are some genuinely suspenseful scenes and some really pulse-pounding moments that are brought out nicely and really get you on the edge of your seat (I am really big fan of supernatural thrillers of this type, so this film was really a treat). The plot itself starts off very well, and as the film progresses, becomes more and more interesting and involving. I liked the entire story and I thought it was very well written and not at all hard to follow. I was rooting for Basinger the entire time, just like was intended, and wasn't once bored at all with what was happening on screen.The acting isn't bad either. Kim Basinger leads the cast, and plays the heroine well. Jimmy Smitts is good in his supporting role as a detective trying to help Maggie, and Hollistan Coleman, playing the part of the young Cody, displays a very innocent and adorable character (she actually reminded me quite a lot of my niece). Rufus Sewell is very good at playing 'evil', and Angela Bettis (I've always liked her) is again excellent in her role as Maggie's sister. Christina Ricci (like her too) also has a semi-small role as a troubled girl who was involved with the religious cult, and even with what time she has on screen, is excellent. The characters are all brought to life and very well fleshed out, which is a major attribute to overall effect of the movie. Some of the CGI effects were a little unnecessary though, but I suppose it was the director's vision of bringing actual evil to life, could have been done in a better way though. The film's conclusion was kind of predictable, but it wasn't bad in the least and it fit with the rest of the movie.Bottom line - Bless The Child is an excellent supernatural thriller film that fulfilled all of my expectations, and had me on the edge of my seat. It's a very original (and interesting) take on a story that's been done many times before, and is ultimately rewarding in the end. Highly recommended for fans of thriller films, you won't be disappointed with it. 8/10.

Then when the same critics are overwhelmingly praising an exercise in excess like the new King Kong, you begin to wonder if their judgment can be trusted about a film like Bless the Child. Not that Bless the Child is a small independent film, it had a $40 Million budget although there is little sign much of that money actually made it onto the screen; except the DVD has far more extensive special features than a low-budget production.Anyway, if you are curious enough to view Bless the Child and if your expectations are modest, you should find it a pleasant surprise. Not because of Ricci (who has only two scenes although both are done well). Or because of Holm (who makes an extremely short appearance of little consequence). And not because of Bettis, although she gets a fair amount of screen time and has one especially good scene at the start of the film. And not because of top billed Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits, who give competent if unexceptional performances.The real star is young Holliston Coleman (best known as the Me in the television movie Miss Lettie and Me) as six year old Cody. Director Chuck Russell (The Mask, Eraser) gets a restrained but glowing performance from Coleman as a six-year-old savior sent by God to restore mankind's faith. At the start of the film, a strung-out Bettis brings then 9-day old Cody for a long over-due visit with older sister Maggie, a NYC psychological nurse. Once Maggie starts fussing with the baby, Bettis sneaks out, leaving Cody behind to be raised by Maggie.At first it is thought that Cody is autistic but when she starts resurrecting dead birds and performing small scale miracles her Aunt Maggie (Basinger) begins to realize that she is something else. Without the right actress and the right level of performance this whole idea would be truly awful, but Coleman deftly alternates between playful and serious, giving the character a believability that has to be seen to (dare we say it) be believed.The suspense is provided by a self-empowerment guru named Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), who is actually an agent of the devil and intends to kill Cody if he cannot turn her to the dark side. Stark first appears about midway into the film, which begins to go steadily downhill from that point.There are a couple of good thrills (including a bedroom full of rats), one great scare (the nanny's face changes suddenly and unexpectedly into that of a demon), and some lame special effects stuff that doesn't work well (Maggie's drive against the flow of traffic). In a cool and perversely funny scene Maggie threatens Eric with a gun and he says, Are you really going to shoot me? Right here in front of Cody? Maggie simply tells Cody to close her eyes.

So this guy that appears to all as a Satanist, he is not; I wanted to get this clear because when Detective John Travis is looking for the cover of Eric Stark's book do what you will, will what you do, he notices that the exact same phrase is written down in some other book below Dr. LaVey's picture (for those who need information, Dr. Anton Szandor LaVey is the founder of the Church of Satan..a simple organization for Satanists that pay taxes..), why am I remarking this? Simple, Satanists and Luciferians are not best friends precisely.So, WTF was that about Satan appearing in the rotten church? If we stand by the movies principle of Erik Stark being a satanist, he could not believe neither in god or satan, because they are christian deitys and this is not precisely christianism...NOR anti-christianism... for those of you who dont know, Satanism was practiced even before Christianity appeared (no, we dont burn churches, no we do not hate christians..)..

The director of Bless the Child even makes reference to that exact point on the DVD.  Of course, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist and The Omen are the old-time classics of the genre, but more recently, we've been treated to Stigmata, End of Days and Lost Souls.  Now, we have Bless the Child to add to this group.  I have seen all the films I listed above with the exception of End of Days, which I am planning on seeing soon.  I have to confess that I didn't care for Rosemary's Baby (!!), and really liked Lost Souls (!!).  I have always enjoyed this type of movie, and was looking forward to seeing Bless the Child, and finally picked it up recently.  For the most part, I was really impressed with the film.  I think the box office was hurt by the unfair trashing the movie received from the critics.  No, it's not on the same level as The Exorcist, but few films are. The major players are good in their roles, and I was especially impressed with Rufus Sewell in his role of Eric, the leader of New Dawn, a Satanic cult masquerading as a self help clinic.  I came to really hate his character and enjoyed watching him get eviler as the movie went on. My only complaint with the performances would be at the beginning.  The early scenes with Kim Basinger and Angela Bettis in the apartment seem a little to scripted and don't flow very well.  Small thing, but it may put off some people for the rest of the movie.  Lastly on the negative, some of the sets and backdrops look too staged.  The rooftop scene of Eric's apartment comes to mind. I was relieved to see the director using restraint with the special effects.  Too often these days do movies get overloaded with F/X that look silly and distracts from the story.  In Bless the Child, there are only a handful of scenes that have computer generated demons, and each time the effects are top notch and welcome.

If it had been made prior to Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist, it may have been groundbreaking; but now, it's just another Catholic-horror, Satanist-conspiracy, we're-in-the-end-times flick, defeated by its familiarity.  The cast includes Kim Basinger, who I'm not a big fan of, but she's acceptable in a non-sexy, single-mom (aunt, actually) role, learning that her little niece's touch of autism may in fact be a touch of the divine; Rufus Sewell, who played the heavy in A Knight's Tale, as the millionaire head of a New Age self-help movement that turns out to be a Satanic cult (there's a stretch); Jimmy Smits as an FBI agent (he's done this sort of work before, in The Believers; the dialogue makes a film-buff's reference to it, when one of the cops refers to him as the guy who broke the Santeria case a few years ago); Christina Ricci as a street junkie; and Ian Holm (!) in a one-scene role as a scholarly priest in a wheelchair.  While the CGI effects are good, they're also pointless and gratuitous; for the most part, the movie actually would've been better without them.  Bless the Child is better than Lost Souls and somewhat better than The Ninth Gate (both of which also squandered talented casts and directorial flair on warmed-over Satanist nonsense), but what kind of praise is that??

As a seminary student who is into film, I try to see all of these kinds of movies as they come out.  I've been pleased with some of them (End of Days, The Exorcist, The First Power, The Prophecy) and totally disappointed by some (Stigmata, Omega Code.)  But this movie did what none of those others did it stayed (for the most part) true to the Catholic/Christian system of beliefs that the film claimed to be about, without warping it into some universalist faith (Dogma, Stigmata) and without sacrificing quality of film (Omega Code).  The angels and demons being visible to Maggie as well as the obvious power of prayer reminded me of a Frank Peretti novel.This film was extremely well acted with the possible exception (ironically) of the super-star lead, Kim Basinger.  She did not react with the horror that a normal person would in the same situations, but often like Vicki Vale. Someone like Demi Moore or Bridget Fonda would have been a lot better in the role, but on the whole this movie was excellent.  I rate it a 9 1/2 out of 10 as measured against other religious thrillers and an 8 out of ten on a general scale. Keep an eye on the cute but haunting child lead.  She was amazing!

There is no suspense to be found, and the actors are often slumming it, and to be honest I didn't blame them. Bless The Child often feels like a straight to video production, featuring an A-list cast. Kim Bassinger can be a credible actress, but here she is overwhelmed with crappy material. Are we really supposed to believe That Basinger's fatal gunshot wound in the end, can be healed by an angel, just like that?. I believe in god, but that was too far fetched for my liking. It's also very slow for the most part, I often found myself having trouble, paying attention to the silly plot. Bless The Child was a movie, I avoided for years, due to all the bad reviews, but I needed something to rent, so I thought why not?. I also found the kid abuse to be extremely unpleasant. Dangling a kid off a high roof, is supposed to be invigorating?. Bless The Child is one of the worst Horror/Thriller's i've seen in recent memory.Performances. Kim Bassinger is OK, but often looked bad, due to the terrible script. Her character doesn't give us enough information, nor does it have enough development, to make us care. For her age, she certainly looks good, though. Christina Ricci gets 1st rate billing, but is barely in the film. Jimmy Smits is OK as the cop, but has done this part, before. Holliston Coleman is the best actor in the film, and that's pretty bad. For her age, she gives a remarkably steady performance, I was quite impressed. Rufus Sewell gives an amusingly hammy Satan worshiping, performance. Angela Bettis is OK as Jenna, but overdid it in some scenes. She did good in looking strung out, though. Bottom line.

Mirroring biblical times 2000 years earlier, the young child, who is destined to be a prophet or saint, is sought out to either be converted to the dark side, or killed. In a pivotal scene the bad steward says, If you believe in God, jump from this high building and He will save you. The little girl, 6 now, eventually says, You first.Several places during the film, where a good person is in one bind or another (subway doors closing, car hanging off bridge), someone shows up to save them, yet no one else sees them and they disappear after the act.

Something that seems strikes me as a little odd, however when a boring, silly film like The Last Temptation of Christ (apostles with NEW YORK accents? How brilliant.) comes out, atheist types line up to see Christ being portrayed as just a regular guy who was just as weak and corrupt as the rest of mankind. They then praise the film as a masterpiece, a more realistic account of Christ than the one the Bible gives, as if they had some sort of inside knowledge about Jesus that those silly Christians just don't have. They then get on boards like this one and preach to Christians about how narrow-minded and silly they are for having faith in something, and even tell them that they have no right to be angry or upset when their God is portrayed this way. As if upsetting Christians isn't the primary reason trashy, overrated films like Last Temptation get made in the first place. Well, that and greed, since people will flock to see such a controversial (read blasphemous, degrading and disrespectful) film. But then, whenever a movie like Bless The Child is made, portraying Christ as a force for good and a savior to mankind; as someone higher and more powerful than common humanity, atheists also line up to see it, strictly for the pleasure of denouncing it as Christian propaganda. They then go on to exaggerate its every flaw and make it sound like the most horrible film ever made. They really hate movies that dare to suggest that the assurance that There is no God but you might be false. Similarly, a lot of people really seem to bristle at the suggestion that there are people who work against God and would kill for Satan. That's so unrealistic!, they proclaim. Tell that to Charles Manson (in case you don't remember, he was a leader of a cult of drug addicts and devil worshipers who thought he was some kind of dark lord and gladly killed for him), or Richard Ramirez, or one of the hundreds of devil-worshiping killers or cults that have existed throughout history. This movie isn't so unrealistic, when you think about it.  I also find it very odd when a Satanist gets huffy about being accused of being, well, a devil-worshiper. Don't be silly. You follow a religion named after the adversary to the Christian God, and then you get all offended when people think you might just be a bad person. Perhaps you should expect that reaction among sane people. Come on, you can't expect to brand yourself with the name of the enemy of God and man, and be surprised when it gets a reaction. If you are, that suggests that perhaps you're playing around with something you don't understand. I pray you'll grow up some day and see the truth. Sorry for the rant, but the way this movie is portrayed here is ridiculous. It's by no means the greatest movie ever made, but it's a good little film about good triumphing over evil. It's about love, faith, and the power of prayer. The child actress in this film is wonderful; she plays a believable and sympathetic character who possesses a vulnerable, fragile quality, as well as a quiet strength. She brings tears to your eyes. The supporting cast is good, Rufus Sewell, Christina Ricci, Ian Holm, Jimmy Smits and Kim Basinger all perform well. The story isn't flawless, but it holds your interest throughout and, if you're a believer, it's also quite emotional at times (whether you're Catholic or not). The movie manages to be frightening and thrilling without a bunch of gratuitous gore (although there is some) and nudity. But it also inspires us; it leaves us with a sense of hope and with the message not to be afraid to recognize evil and to stand and confront it with God's help through prayer and faith. That isn't a bad thing at all. So I would recommend this movie to people of faith and people with open minds. If you're a die-hard atheist or a Satanist, you probably won't enjoy it, unless watching movies you've decided to hate beforehand is one of your hobbies. There seems to be a lot of people who like to do things like that. But if you don't like it and decide to review it, try to be honest about its flaws and shortcomings instead of getting carried away with your emotions and preaching your non-belief to the rest of us. Or can't you enlightened ones manage it? Okay, now I'LL stop preaching. Sorry about that.
