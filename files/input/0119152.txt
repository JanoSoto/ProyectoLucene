[{"Title":"One of the best family films!","Date":"28 February 2001","Score":"12 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family","Review":"  Free Willy 3 is primarily about Max, an intelligent, inquisitive ten-year-old who accompanies his father on a whaling expedition.  His conscience bothers him about his father's career, but instead of taking the usual route of performing a string of silly pranks (like you would see in a lot of children's shows), he tries reasoning with his dad.  He also asks question after question -- not just about the technical aspects of whaling, but he also delves deeper into the more important questions of life (Do you always have to do the right thing, even if it hurts?). One of the things I liked best about Free Willy 3 was the realistic and sympathetic portrayal of the father, even though he was the villain of the story.  He was a man doing a job that has been in his family for years, and without it he wasn't sure who he was.  Despite having a career others disagreed with, he was a caring, compassionate person who loved his son.  Other characters are drawn out nicely as well -- Jesse and Randolph, from the first two films, and their new co-workers on the sea -- showing their tempers as well as their more positive sides.Couple all these features with stunning cinematography and a beautiful score, and you have one fine film!

If you can't appreciate such a touching film as Free Willy 3 The Rescue, I'd like to see what you guys watch. This movie really touched me, so did the other two movies in the trilogy. I'll admit, this movie may not have been as good as the other two, which is why I'm only giving it a 9 out of 10, but it still is quite the masterpiece. It's better than any of those other bullshit movies about animals, like air bud or MVP! Those movies were garbage and have absolutely nothing on free Willy. Free Willy 3 The Rescue, has, and always will have, a special place in my heart. I grew up with this trilogy and I hold it very dear to my heart. If you're a parent and you want your child to see some quality film making, I advise you to rent Free Willy 3. This movie doesn't have any violence or anything that'll warp your child's mind into growing up to be some crack-head, animal beating criminal, which is what most movies tend to be doing these days. No, this movie will inspire your kid to do good with his life, it'll make your child appreciate the beauty of animal life. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you watch it asap. It will appeal to people of all ages.

Basically, (Jesse Jason James) Richter is now sixteen years old, and has taken a job on a ship as both researcher and protector of Orca whales. He is working with old friend Randolph Johnson (August Schellenberg), sarcastic scientist Drew Halbert (Annie Corley), and on the ocean he is of course reunited with old friend Willy the Whale (Keiko). Meanwhile, on a whaling ship is John Wesley (Patrick Kilpatrick) and his young son Max (Vincent Berry), who after seeing many of them isn't very keen on killing the Orca whales. While he doesn't have the guts to say no to his Dad, Jesse gets Max to meet Willy and his new girlfriend who is pregnant with their baby, and he realises that his Dad is doing something illegal and nasty to nature. Also starring Tasha Simms as Mary Wesley, Peter LaCroix as 1st Mate Sanderson, Stephen E. Miller as Dineen, Ian Tracey as Kron and Matthew Walker as Captain Drake. The problem with this one is that the human story takes over and we hardly see enough of the beautiful, originally show stealing creatures, the birth of a baby nearly makes up for the lack of time they are used, but the first film is always going to be the one to watch.

Now, I watched the third movie and I found it excellent, almost as great as the original, though the first Free Willy movie is without a doubt the best in the trilogy. In this movie our main hero Jesse is now 16 and he begins to work with his old friend Randolph on a scientific researching ship. This summer new danger threatens his relations with giant whale Willy - illegal whalers. Jesse meets young boy, who is son of the captain of whaler's ship and he tries to convince him that whales are living creatures and not just a food for expensive restaurants. The relations and dialogs between captain of whaler's ship and his son Max (played by two newcomers Patrick Kilpatrick and Vincent Berry) and dialogs between them are the strongest parts of the movie. Acting is still pretty good and young Vincent Berry who was much better than slightly annoying Fransis Capra is the second movie created an excellent and memorable performance as Max, young and innocent kid, who learns that his father is involved in illegal fishing. Jason James Richter one more time (to my great sadness the last time) showed his acting abilities with strong performance as almost grown-up Jesse. Free Willy 3 is beautifully shot movie with gorgeous cinematography which is as good as in first movie but here we can entire ocean instead of small pool. With such a good cinematography, great scenery, well written and poignant story and good soundtrack the last Free Willy 3 is an excellent example how good can be a family movie. Sweet and innocent, bright and entertained and that's the most important to me without any sign of vulgarity and typical rude humor it easily became to all-time family classic. Anyone must realize that whales (and others animals) can be more human than people.My rating 9,5 out of 10. The movie is dedicated to memory of Keith A.Walker (the man who brought two great characters Willy and Jesse into our life). IMDb is a great source for any movie lover but some ratings can be exceptionally misleading.

This time Jason James Richter and August Schellenberg must rescue Willy from poachers who probably wish to eat the whale so to save viewers from a possible Free Willy 4. Director Sam Pillsbury does his best but even the photography looks bland. The screenplay is about as exciting as picking food from your teeth. Hearing a third grade kid read a book report on the whale would be more interesting than anything that happens in this sleep fest. Richter should be given some sort of an award for all the whales he has seen under the influence of bad sequels. Schellenberg also returns because he obviously pitied Richter and decided to share the blame. Also with Annie Corley and Patrick Kilpatrick who must deal with having this junk on their resumes. The animal rights message doesn't really matter here. This is just feeding off another franchise that never really had a fresh angle to begin with. We all understand the need to preserve wildlife but this feels more like an opportunity to milk a dying franchise to death. Even the whale looks like it ought to be moving on to better things, like the stage version of Orca. Perhaps the filmmakers should free Willy and come up with a new idea.

Most people who gave it a low rating were expecting exaggerated things, amazing adventure like no other and hence they were disappointed. This move, though short (that's what I thought), was simple and sensitive. The ending was rather lame they could have spiced it up like sending the guy to jail or something like that but right afterward you see the female whale give birth-hence with the facts without being too much like a lot of movies are nowadays.

I also loved the scenes between Nikki and Willy, and the one when Nikki gives birth which was brilliantly done. The score is absolutely beautiful, the pacing is brisk and the direction is amiable. And the characters are appealing especially Willy and Nikki, while Jesse and Max are great characters and the father is a sympathetic figure even for the villain of the piece, except I don't see him as a proper villain, just someone who means well but doesn't know exactly what he wants. The acting is good too, Jason James Richter and Vincent Berry are very likable, August Schellenberg makes a welcome return as Randolph and Patrick Kalpatrick does a great job with his character.All in all, a pleasant family film. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"A Whale of a Tale!!","Date":"14 March 1999","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family","Review":"  FREE WILLY was one of the best Feel-good movies ever made!  It isn't often that a movie makes you both Sad and happy at the same time and makes you want to stand up and cheer at the ending, but FREE WILLY was one of the few movies that did it.  Willy and Jesse met again in FREE WILLY 2 and it was great to see them together again, but unfortunately the enterprising premise (involving an oil spill in the ocean endangering Willy and his Family) turned out to be a bit too slow-paced and in some cases too hokey (like the scene where Jesse and Willy re-unite again after the first time Jesse plays the harmonica...it could have been thought out better).  Also the film spent too much time dealing with the issues of Jesse's new Step-brother, Elvis. However, the suspenseful last half-hour of the movie was great.  Which brings us to Part 3 which is actually almost as good as the first film and a lot better than part 2.  The storyline (involving the wrongful and illegal hunting of Whales and Jesse & Randolph's quest to stop a crew of nasty hunters) is very well written and emotionally charged like the first movie. I wish this film was marketed and advertised better because it really deserves to be seen!  It is emotional and heartfelt like the magic of the first FREE WILLY and in the end you will stand up and cheer.  It's cool to see what has become of Jesse and how he has grown up and it is good to know that Jesse and Randolph will always stick together to do what is right! If you passed on this because you were afraid that it was more of the same, guess again!  It is another wonderful story that deserves to be enjoyed again and again!  Check it out!!!

Although not as good, it still gives you the same feeling and remains an iconic landmark. Free Willy 2 was also great with many great elements. Now, there's Free Willy 3 the most different and edgiest which polarizes the opinions of the viewers. Jesse gets a job working with his longtime buddy Randolph. They discover that Willy is going to be a father, so Jesse is excited. Meanwhile, young Max Wesley sees his father illegally hunting wales. Max knows that's wrong, but his dad convinces him it is not a big deal. Max befriends Willy and starts to feel for him. When Jesse and Randolph get involved, they try to stop Max's father from more wale killings. Richter and Schellenberg are the only two returning cast members. Many people wonder what happened to Elvis and Nadine from the previous flick. I found Jesse and Randolph alone to be fine, as they are the best characters. One may also not like half the story centring around Max and his family. They also may not like seeing his father hunting and killing wales, which is shown. There are also brawls which make things less settling. Having said that, this movie needed that action and brutality. Doing another Free Willy movie in the same fashion as the first two would suck. Although the first two were good, they were also dry and stale with little excitement. The sheer danger rises which makes for more excitement. "},{"Title":"the screenplay for Free Willy 3 The Rescue follows its politically correct formula without a whole lot of style","Date":"15 September 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family","Review":" In 1998, a man named Steinar Bastesen publicly declared his opinion that the money spent on training the captive orca Keiko should instead be spent on grinding the poor animal into six tons of meatballs as foreign aid for the starving people in Africa. This coming from the same man who would probably encourage families with more than a single pet to grind up one of their cats for the villages of China. Well, Mr. Bastesen would have probably been&#x97;and just might have been, depending if he saw the movie or not&#x97;just as infuriated by the content of the last movie that Keiko had starred in. The movie is Free Willy 3 The Rescue, and it takes a politically correct hand holding a politically correct spear and jabs it into the guts of people like Mr. Bastesen. I support the cause all the way. I just wish I could support the movie for its dramatic content. Again, this is a review of the movie, not the movie's cause.Free Willy 3 The Rescue is a prime example of an underwritten kids' movie sequel something we unfortunately get too much of these days. It is the third and&#x97;until just recently&#x97;last installment in the popular franchise about a young boy (Jason James Richter) and his friendship with a six-ton whale (Keiko). In the previous two movies, Mr. Richter saved Keiko first from a neglectful theme park owner and then later from oil-infested waters. Now the threat comes from a band of poachers, the leader of whom is taking his son along on the hunt for the very first time. As one would expect, the son (Vincent Berry) doesn't conform to his father's illicit way of making a living and ends up siding with Mr. Richter to save Willy and his family.There are good elements to Free Willy 3. One of the promising dynamic between Mr. Berry and the superb actor Patrick Kilpatrick as his father. The latter does a particularly good job portraying a man who devotedly loves his family and blindly does what he does partially out of the desire to support his loved ones and partially because his family tree essentially demands it of him. His grandfather harpooned sperm whales so he feels he should harpoon orcas. I also appreciated how well Mr. Berry displayed enthusiasm at the beginning&#x97;going on a big event with his father&#x97;and then the horror when he first sees an innocent animal getting run clean through with a harpoon. The emotion in this sequence doubles the emotion&#x97;and lessens the gimmicky disturbance&#x97;from a similar scene in Michael Anderson's pretentious 1977 film Orca. I also enjoyed Mr. Richter's third-time-around performance. The only other returning character is August Schellenberg; he's reliable as well. Apart from that, I did enjoy some of the scenery when the characters on land; there's something magnetic about looking at a coastal village the docks, the boats, the water shoreline, the coastal trees. It's the sort of place one thinks about retiring to someday.However, the screenplay to Free Willy 3 follows its politically correct formula without a whole lot of style. Now the first Free Willy movie, released in 1993, did not say anything we didn't already know about the issue of whales in captivity, but it approached the subject with a great deal of heart. Hence why it won over the hearts of many children, myself included. But John Mattson's script for the third movie does not have very much of this, and there is zero sense of friendship between Jason James Richter and the whale. As far as the movie is concerned, these two just met for the first time and Mr. Richter is merely fascinated by the whale. And even the whale is not given much to do. The movie might as well be about a trivial whale, not one that starred in two previous pictures. The animatronic stand-ins for Keiko are utilized too often now, and the jaws open and close with too much hectic speed to convince that it's flesh and blood. A scene where the protagonist feed Willy and his mate oranges is very revealing. There's no sensation from past events, such as the time Willy saved Mr. Richter from drowning in the tank in the first film. And although Vincent Berry does have some cute scenes between him and the whale (at one point they start to play volleyball with the whale launching the ball back onto the decks of the boat), there are not enough of them.The movie overall is a lazy effort with a rushed mindset. It ironically comes alive mostly when it is on land and is not so exciting when on the water. And even the usually interesting concluding shots of the whales swimming and leaping freely through the frigid North Pacific waters is disappointing this time around, as they are merely reusing stock shots from the previous two pictures. It's really jarring when at one point the whales are moving behind a blue sky, then a red-laced dusk setting, and then a blue one again.

Maybe, Willy could be abducted by space aliens who don't have killer whales on their planet and want to study him, and Jesse and Randolph go into space to get him back, or maybe a story ten years later, Jesse is married and has a family and Willy is starting to get pretty old. Or Willy is once again placed in an amusement park-- in Paris, France! Jesse has to free him once again.
