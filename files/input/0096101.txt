But there are hundreds more memorable moments from the film which came flooding back to me as I watched, much to the annoyance of my housemates.Great film, maybe not in a 'Pulp Fiction/Donnie Darko' sort of way, but great in a 'Bill & Ted/Flight of the Navigator' way, that it's a testament of my youth and will be shown to my kids when I eventually have some!p.s. anyone notice a small similarity between Cynthia Gibb in this film and young Potter star Emma Watson?

Its massively entertaining, has got great laughs, some moral, an excellent, well sustained plot and well executed by a magnificent cast, namely Fisher Stevens.Its great that Stevens was credited with the lead role and rightly so, in an improvement from the original outing. Here, we are minus the Badham influence and that becomes clear, with really no breaks in the movies rhythm at any point with tiring government sequences and computer based scenes.It feels more light-hearted, captures imagination whilst developing the tone of the previous film. Here, now Johnny Number 5, and not just number 5 winds up in the big city absorbing as much input as he could possibly get. He helps build the toy number 5's in what should be a great money spinner for Stevens and his new found partner and watch seller, McKean.Along the way are the usual difficulties, those being Stevens' attempt to rid the crooks from his happenings, to fit in with society, i.e. girlfriend whilst hoping to prevent the sale of number 5 by McKean when he discovers the truth of the actual cost of the high-tech human bot.Although the original was still touching and heart-felt, there is more of this in the sequel, its just beautifully coordinated and will remain a classic for many years to come.Whilst there is no real feel for seriousness in this one, there is moral in every sense. The feeling of want, happiness and success and the idea of making a true friend, albeit in this case, in the form of a robot.And who has ever heard a non-Indian do an Indian voice as well as that. Very clever, realistic, Stevens is brilliant. I would really love to see this guy performing a great deal more in more prominent roles.All credit to Stevens and co, in an improvement to the previous adventure. A truly sensational motion picture.

This time he goes to New York City to help his co-creator Ben Jahrvi (Fisher Stevens) making toys-tiny robots that look just like Five. And he has named himself Johnny Five! Can you imagine what will happen when Johnny realizes that he's in a big city (No one has told that to him...he was put in a box to be transferred from Montana to where Ben is located...because they know how curious and crazy for input he is) and then goes out exploring just about everywhere?Johnny talks a lot more like a human than he used to, but people still treat him like a ridiculous-looking machine, they don't know he is alive, and they are not willing to believe it. As Johnny Five helps Ben and his partner Fred Ritter (Michael McKean), we can see Johnny is very intelligent, cheerful, full of life and loves to help. And then, Oscar Baldwin (Jack Weston), a man who's about to steal some really valuable jewelry, notices Johnny's being naive, enthusiastic about helping people and his abilities. He and two other thieves proceed to cheat and use Johnny Five. But Johnny will go chasing them soon after he's aware of what has happened. The movie is dramatic, breath-taking, dynamic and heart-warming.Interestingly, the endings of the original and of the sequel are quite opposite in some way, but they are both happy ones. Tim Blaney, as the voice of Johnny Five, successfully brought the character to life. Michael McKean as Fred, a smart, a little bit greedy salesman, who basically is not a bad guy. He played so beautifully that he made Fred become a very charming guy!I want to thank the creators, the entire cast and the crew for this extraordinary work. Also, the soundtrack is great.

Through very well-worn staples of robots-with-emotions stories, it explores the nature of personality and what it really means to be alive. However, it avoids total redundancy by pairing Johnny Five, a brainy, kindly robot with retro pop culture references just popping out of his head, with Benjamin, a nerdy, overzealous soon-to-be citizen played with equal silliness and empathy by Fisher Stevens. Two scenes in particular truly stand out one, when Johnny Five has been arrested, he sits chained to a wall contemplatively reading Pinocchio and Frankenstein. In another, after Five has been mercilessly beaten (as an adult, it still makes me cry), he meets up with Fred, played by Michael McKean. Too injured to speak and running on a stolen car battery, Johnny Five desperately (yet painfully slowly) scrawls his pleas for help on an alley wall with a rock. This film has many flaws from both technical and aesthetic viewpoints, but I still just can't divorce myself from how moving it is to watch a robot genuinely struggle to be alive in both a physical and metaphysical sense.

(Funny, in the first movie wasn't his last name Jabituya?) One of the toys rolled off on its own and into the office of Sandy Banatoni who desparately was trying to come up with a new toy idea to please her boss. When she saw the toy robot, she was extatic. She found Ben and requested more. But since Ben constructed the ten he was selling in back of his van, it didn't seem possible but a nearby watch merchant, Fred Ritter, promised to fill Sandy's order of 1,000. So he rented out a warehouse cited for demolition and hired a group of homeless people to be the workers. Meanwhile, two thieves, Saunders and Jones, were out to steal some very valuable jewels that were brought to the bank that day and the way to the vault was through that old warehouse. That evening, Ben, Fred and the workers were able to construct 25 toy robots, then suddenly Saunders and Jones burst in and destroyed all the equipment as well as the toy robots then left. Things looked bad. Suddenly, a package was delivered to Ben. Then out popped Number 5, or Johnny 5, the robot! He had been sent by Newton Crosby and Stephanie to help Ben. If you thought Johnny was a fast reader, you should see him construct a toy robot. He built 74 in an hour. By morning all 1000 were complete.         Ben went off to see Sandy about the robots while Fred stayed with Johnny. Ben knew that if Johnny knew he was in the city, he would be getting bad input, but that big mouth Fred told Johnny it was the city so Johnny went out to obsorb all new input. He was immediately shunned by people on the streets but was talked into helping a gang steal car stereos. They told him they were people who repaired them. Johnny boosted 57 stereos! They thanked him by spraying grafiti all over him. On his way back at the warehouse, he meets Oscar Baldwin, a chairman at the bank who was very interested in Johnny 5. Johnny says his value is eleven million dollars. Getting a conniving idea, Fred tries to sell Johnny but he escapes into the park amongst a bunch of art statues. Some critics tell him he's ugly. Meanwhile, Ben has a secret crush on Sandy but she only seems interested in that toy robot order. But with Johnny's help, Ben was able to take Sandy on a date and made all the right moves, not to mention several bad ones, but Sandy had a good time and things were really looking up. Unfortunately, Oscar was in cahoots with Jones and Saunders so they kidnap Ben and Fred and lock them in the freezer at a Chinese restaurant. Oscar uses Johnny to get at the bank vault. He successfully get's the diamonds.        Ben and Fred rig a telephone from a telephone line and Ben's calculator. They reach Sandy and lead her to them by golden oldies clues. They're soon rescued, but by then Oscar, Jones and Saunders were killing Johnny. They beat him up badly then ran off and what's worse, the police suspect Ben and Sandy as the bank robbers and arrest them. Fred finds Johnny who had 30 minutes before his power was completely gone so he and Fred go into a Radio Shack. Fred was not an expert on mechanics and they only had 15 minutes left, but with Johnny's guidance, his back-up power was boosted and his arm was reattached so he finished repairing himself. Now Johnny was mad. He raced after the crooks with Fred. Ben and Sandy are released and they follow Johnny. They soon all arrive at the docks. Johnny gives Jones and Saunders a work-out. Oscar escapes and Johnny's power is one minute from complete shut down. So Johnny devised a plan and it worked! Oscar was taken to jail but by then, Johnny's power completely run out. Ben luckily brought him back by a paramedic shock machine. So in conclusion, Johnny 5 was commended for saving the diamonds and he and Ben became American citizens!       Practically as good as the first. Fisher Stevens returns as Ben. I know in my Short Circuit review I said he was annoying, but that was when he was a sidekick. He did pretty good as Number 1 so I retract my earlier statement! Michael McKean (who was in practically everything in the '80s) is Fred. Tim Blaney returns to voice Johnny 5. They never made a Short Circuit 3, but if they did, what would it be out? Perhaps Johnny finds a female robot like him? Who knows. But anyway, if you enjoyed Short Circuit and want to see further adventures of America's favorite robot with an attitude, then I recommend Short Circuit 2!- "},{"Title":"Not as good as the original, but quite up there.","Date":"27 November 1999","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  Jonny Five's back... is this a good thing?

His options however, are limited and his new job sees him building toy Number 5's in the back of his van (which is also his home and office) and selling them on the street. A chance encounter with toy buyer Sandy Banatoni nets him an order for 1000 in only a month or two. Street hustler Fred helps him get premises for a factory (albeit a condemned one) in Midtown Manhattan. However unbeknownst to any of them the factory is already populated by bank thieves looking to tunnel into the bank across the road and steal a stock of diamonds. Their plans are greatly helped by the real Number 5 arriving on the scene but how will he react when he learns that outside the factory doors is a city full of input.Following on from the guilty pleasure of the original film, Short Circuit 2 brings Johnny 5 to a city that looks like New York in the same way as a goldfish looks like a shark. The narrative itself is a mixed bag as it runs together plots about toy manufacture, jewel heists, a romance and 5's ongoing struggle to fit in and be accepted as a living being rather than a machine. The majority of it is very basic stuff and just produces noisy stuff that kids will enjoy but will do little for many others. The romance aspect is forced and unconvincing and is the one part of the film that should have been totally dropped. The strength of the film is 5's attempts to fit in and his internal struggle with the desire to be accepted by others. The few scenes that have this theme at its heart are the stronger parts of the film and it is a shame that they are few and far between.Johnny 5 is perhaps a bit too wacky and comic to endear himself to adults but children (and people my age who were children back in the 80's) will love him. Blaney's voice work is a bit grating at times and is not helped by some of his dialogue but he is assured in the more touching moments while the robot itself has a surprising good use of body language to convey emotion considering it is just a big special effect. The irony of having white Stevens playing an Indian cliché in a film that has themes of acceptance and being yourself may have been lost on the writers but it did amuse me &#150; which is more than I can say for Stevens himself. He tries hard to make the material work for him but his performance seems more and more in bad taste as time goes on. McKean is amusing in a fairly obvious character while Gibb can do little with the side of the script she is handed.Overall then a solid children's film that could have done more but too often settles for simple comic antics. Children of the 80's will probably enjoy it since it is part of cultural knowledge and experience but just don't expect it to be as good as your rose tinted reminiscing would have you remember it.

The funny thing is that even sequels to these kinds of films, are welcomed with open arms by their previous viewers. Turned out I had the exact opposite feeling for this originally. Like most moviegoers, we like to see sequels with the same characters. Short Circuit 2 only provided two original characters from the first No. 5 and Ben. Before seeing the rest I didn't know what to expect and I wasn't sure if I would have liked it.Without reading any reviews, I noticed the approval rating for this film had decreased from that of its original. However, I also noticed that Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert thought it was better the first so it had to be given a shot. Surprisingly, I was satisfied more with this installment that I was with the first. The sequel to the first not only improves itself but also involves its characters more within the plot.Besides No.5, who now calls himself Johnny 5, being the main character, Newton Crosby's co-worker, Ben (Fisher Stevens) moves to the The Big City to try and make a living selling No.5 knock-off toys. Also trying to make a living is cheapskate speed talker, Fred Ritter (Michael McKean), who cops a deal with Ben to sell out his inventory so he can gain part of his profit. Fortunately, Johnny 5 is sent to them, from Crosby in Montana to help them get the job done.Stevens still plays a goofy Ben who still doesn't quite know how to speak correctly. McKean also has some comical moments due to his street smarts. I was amazed to find out he was the voice of Insaniac from Small Soldiers (1998). Johnny 5 is still the same; still speed-reads, still loves dancing, and is still constantly looking for input. Just like the first film, there is a love interest here. This time it is for Ben, her name is Sandy Banatoni played by Cynthia Gibb. I can't say Gibb gives anything for the movie character wise, but she is a nice addition to the cast. What impressed me even more was how the character of Ritter was given so much attention in character development. It was great to see him have a change of heart.The effects still look good even though they are obviously dated. The music, scored by Charles Fox, made me feel more during important scenes than Shire's in the first film and this made me appreciate it more. The comedy seems to be ramped out a little too. I got more laughs from the exchanges between McKean and Stevens than I did from the first with Stevens and Guttenburg. I can't compare Johnny 5 because he's the top character no matter what.However, what I really grabbed my attention here was how involved the characters became with being apart of something close to them. Johnny 5 wants to be accepted by everybody, Ben wants to be accepted by society and have a girlfriend, and Ritter wants to be successful (which I don't blame him for). And to see all these wants attained made me feel so warm inside that I was absolutely content to see such a well done sequel be released to the public.The next chapter of Johnny 5 not only has more laughs but the characters have much more attraction to them. The music and special effects are just the chrome and spit-shine.

The problem is, as with Crocodile Dundee 2 and numerous other sequels, the purpose and originality of the first movie is the development of the characters. The quirks, social ineptitude, surprising qualities, cultural clashes, are what make the movie worthwhile and even enjoyable to watch. With a revenue success, far too often a sequel will appear. Again and again, it becomes clear that when you apply the lovable characters from the first movie to some formulaic plot in the sequel, it fails. It not only fails, it becomes painful to watch, going from one cliché to the next. Funnily enough, the kids seem to like it...

I can see Star Wars ,Lord of the Rings and similar having sequels because the story is too large to be played out in one movie and it is telling a story that requires it. In movies like Short Circuit,Mannequin and tons of others and all time classics like Jaws and Grease, the main story is a one shot and the sequels just an attempt to cash in on the originals success and what they end up doing is cheapening the original,to me they arent really sequels because in all of them except maybe Jaws2,most of the main characters from the original are gone and the plots are very thin .This movie does have one or two cute and funny moments but all in all not even close to the funny romp of the original.Ally Sheedy is gone as is Steve Guttenberg who wisely opted out of this clunker.Spoiler Alert. They conveniently mail Number 5 to Fisher Stevens for hijinks involving crooks and thats all you hear about what happened to their characters. Michael McKean from Laverne and Shirley fame also stars .I do not find him funny like he was on L&S and Fisher Stevens while hilarious in SC1 is overacting way too much in this movie .Jack Weston who plays a sneaky crook who deceives Number 5 into stealing for him doesnt do much better and in every movies he's in ,I find him so annoying as to want him killed off immediately.

It's actually better than it sounds, as Johnny Five is the main character of the movie, and his giant Muppet-Like persona and actions are amazing. So many plot holes I could drive a double-decker bus through them 1.The Army would certainly notice the robot is still alive and reclaim him. 2.An artificial lifeform would not quality for U.S. citizenship. 3.The background for the ceremony doesn't look American at all.

This time, our hero finds himself in a city, and my main complaint with this sequel is the absence of Ally Sheedy. Still, I would say that this is a fair sequel, a needless sequel, but this was a thankfully discontinued franchise. Number 5 ( now requesting to be called Johnny 5, since he feels he has human emotions, he wants a real name.) gets involved with gangs, bad people ( who want to sell him ), and jewel thieves. It steers clear off course from our original sweet story line, but nevertheless puts together some solid performances from our familiar faces from the first movie, including Fisher Stevens and his funny accent! Also, to make matters worse, Short Circuit 2 has half the laughs as the first Short Circuit. It's probably one of the reasons why Hollywood didn't make any more of these, just because a movie is great, that doesn't always mean that it needs a sequel. Sequels are for films that have unresolved issues, Short Circuit was fine the way it ended. Hollywood's need to cash in on senseless sequels was very bad in the 80's, and this film was living proof. All in all, Short Circuit 2 remains to be an enjoyable family feature to this day, it limits its profanity to a minimum, so I would recommend it. I just won't praise it.

This time around the writers copied the fish-out-of-water in New York City formula from Crocodile Dundee, which had been the surprise hit of 1986. Fisher Stevens returns in his role as Ben (thick accent in tow), who has lost his job at NOVA Robotics and is peddling a toy version of Johnny 5 on the streets. He gets swindled into a business deal with conman Fred (played by Michael McKean) to build a thousand of the toys in just one month for a toy company. That's a problem, because Ben calculates it will take at least a year to fill the order.A convenient plot device puts a pair of bumbling crooks underneath our hero's makeshift workshop. They're digging into the bank vault across the street to get their hands on some expensive diamonds. Fearing their plan will be jeopardized, the crooks try to scare them away by roughing up the place when they discover Johnny 5.Johnny 5 can build the toys in no time but gets distracted by what the city has to offer. The mandatory scenes of Johnny 5 causing a stir in public are present and accounted for, as he gets into trouble looking for more input. That wouldn't be quite enough to fill out a feature length film, so of course the burglars take advantage of Johnny 5′s gullibility to break into the bank. It's a by-the-numbers plot, but at least it's better than the first film (though, that's not really saying much).Of course Johnny 5 is still a great looking robot character, and it's easy to see why so many people love him. He even becomes the first robotic American citizen! It's a light-hearted kid's movie, so don't expect many laughs if you're over the age of 8.

He makes a deal with a toy company and gains a business partner named Fred. They start to have problems with production so Johny Five gets sent to them to help them out. However as he discovers that he is in a huge city Johny Five needs a lot of input but also begins to learn a lot of good and bad things about the human race.Johny Five once again makes the film. He is an entertaining and highly amusing character and may be the best robotic character that I have ever seen in a film. He is just as great in this film as he was in the first one.Benjamin is back and that is pretty cool. He gets to do a lot more in this film than he did in the first. The love story in this film is much better than the one they tried to do in Short Circuit.I think a key to this film is that it has a great message. Johny Five feels like an outsider because he is not human, despite the fact that he is a living thing. So I think the whole struggle for belonging is something that helps viewers to sympathize and root for the character searching for belonging.There is also great action in this film at times. Johny Five gets to do a lot of awesome things in this film. The humor is just as funny in this film, mainly due to Johny FIve gets to travel through the city and gain lots of input.

Not the right word. Adore it ? That's close. Whenever you hear me saying I love the 1980s here is one of the reasons why. Actually it's hard to define what is that I'm crazy about here, but let's accept the challenge for the sake of love. First of all  it's everything ! Starting with the character of Johnny Number Five; imagine an electronic E.T with all the sentimentality, genius, and infancy, that speaks fluently also. (Tim Blaney) as his voice was perfect. (Fisher Stevens) as (Ben Jahrvi) got me to memorize his name well because he just amused me utterly, this guy is so talented as an actor and as a comedian, so bad that he didn't receive the credit or the fame he merits, let alone that it was such a rare matter to watch an Indian (or rather an eastern) character in American movie that wasn't meant to be a mean laughingstock, being an intelligent gentle hero without contempt or sarcasm. (Michael McKean) was so nice and charismatic as (Fred Ritter). (Cynthia Gibb) is exceptional as (Sandy), she portrayed the elegant, ingenuous, and smart 80s' girl, there is something ultra-charming about her in this flick that makes her watchable apart. Wanna talk about chemistry between all the cast, that's the movie to remember.Now let me versify a bit about the concept. JN.5 is this kind creature going through totally unkind world. He's soft intellectual person, who deals with evil life very innocently, which afflicted him with its deformity. We clap for how he fights back till he gets even, but forget the big picture. It's not about the machine that wants to be human, it's about a machine that mirrors how inhuman the humans have become. The script provided the movie with all I think  Johnny becomes a TV freak repeating memorable lines from movies and TV shows, Johnny hates his face in the street discovering how he's completely different (great moment by the way), Johnny helps Ben in his love, and the too touching conflict in the end to bear the pain of who thought as friend, and the combat to regain his self heroically, look at him dies like a Christ to relive again.. Just WAW ! There were so many fascinating ideas along the way, on the top of them for sure was the game of songs to locate the imprisoned (Ben) and (Fred), even the fortune cookies' lines were too comic as well.The directing was flawless, and take it from one who doesn't praise any director much. (Kenneth Johnson) made something really that enchanting. There wasn't one scene that you can call bad or so-so. There is a continuous merry feel all over it. Since the first scene at the toy market with the simple music tone it sets a special sweet personality for itself that never misses. (Johnson) was leading the movie as simple adventure however with so much love I suppose which gave it an assured magical touch. Damn, even the best live Disney movies that I can recall didn't reach to this level of being enjoyable, soul-stirring, and never boring after endless times of watching. Still the sequence of Johnny struggling for the rest of his life, walking lamely in the backstreets, bleeding in awful loneliness is one of the most sights that breaks the heart ever captured on film (I cry every time). Also, the finale result of the climactic sequence with Bonny Taylor's I Need a Hero is definitely one of the best climactic sequences I saw in my life. Although this song has been hackneyed so many times through some of the 1980s movies, such as Footloose (1984), Who's Harry Crumb? (1989), but here is the one eloquent use that marvelously clicked. It's disappointing that (Kenneth Johnson), aside from very good TV works, didn't make many cinematic movies, he could've been respectable lovable moviemaker as celebrated as Spielberg, or maybe better.The music score expresses the movie's funny and bright spirit, it was solidly romantic at places, with unforgettable touches like playing Eric Satie's Gymnopedie Nr. 1 while JN.5 was reading in jail; that's priceless. Finally, it's not another great movie, it's the great movie for me. It still delivers the highest times as its power of being cute and effective never seems to end. It's alive flick for sure, and one of the 1980s' best. I believe it's a kind of work that doesn't have even one shortcoming. I'm really confused every time I don't find it in any of the best 100 movies ever lists, though not to worry, it's surely in mine. To all the miserable lovers of (2001 A Space Odyssey) watch and learn, because this one is funny and has a meaning unlike so many overrated dreadful crap that you love. This is what movies are all about guys. Nearly one of the most ultimate movies in being a movie.P.S at the same year of 1988 there were as well (Die Hard), (Switching Channels), (Without a Clue), (Big Business), (Shoot to Kill), (Stand and Deliver), (High Spirits), or even (My Stepmother Is an Alien). I believe that the 1980s was undoubtedly the golden age of the feel good movies.

Basically Ben Jahrvi (Fisher Stevens), who co-invented Number Five, the robot struck by lightning and given a personality, is now living in New York selling small toy versions of his invention. With the help of con artist Fred Ritter (Michael McKean), Ben strikes a deal with a big toy company to produce 1,000 units of his toy with store buyer Sandy Banatoni (Cynthia Gibb), and Fred gets some loaned money for a warehouse, temporary workers and equipment. The workers vacate the premises due to some robbers, so Ben and Fred think it is impossible to get the order ready, until a crate arrives containing Number Five, now Johnny Five, sent by Stephanie and Newton (from the previous film) to help. Johnny Five proves himself a handy attachment to making the business successful, but with his vibrant personality, wanting to see the city and a need for more input, i.e. quickly scanning more books, the robot is easily distracted. The thieves are pressed for time to steal the diamonds from the vault which is located right next to the old warehouse, and they can't do anything about it while Johnny Five is around. But devious bank teller Oscar Baldwin (Jack Weston) sees the robot not as a threat but a likely ally, as the robot believes him to be nice, he sees no problem asking it to help him gain access to the vault. Meanwhile, the order is near completion, and Ben wants Johnny Five to help him tell Sandy how he feels about her, and he manages it. After being rejected by so many people trying to convince them that he is alive, Johnny Five does indeed unintentionally assist the diamond robbery, and the thieves badly damage him to the point of dying and leaking battery fluid. But he manages to stop the bad guys before they can get away with it, and in the he is saved, covered in gold plating and declared a real citizen.

I guess I can sort of agree with the two star rating by the critics in part, but on the other hand, this is still a good fun film, mainly because of the animatronic star.
