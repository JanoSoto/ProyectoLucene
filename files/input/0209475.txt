The Wedding Planner stars Jennifer Lopez as Mary Fiore, a hardworking, beautiful, single woman of Italian descent, who has made a reputable career as a wedding planner.  Fully dedicated to her work, Mary successfully coordinates all the details of her wealthy clients' weddings. She even acts as a kind of therapist, transmitting to the brides and grooms-to-be the optimism that relieves them of their second-thoughts, and that allows them to fulfill their true dreams of marrying. Yet one day, a literal faux pas turns Mary's orderly life upside-down she walks across a street and gets her shoe stuck in a manhole. Just then, a dumpster menacingly rolls down the steep San Francisco street, towards her. Noticing that the dumpster is rapidly gaining speed, a young man rushes to help Mary out of her dilemma. The two are instantly enveloped by the rush of the moment, falling victims to love at first sight. Soon, however, fate shows its cruel side, proving that the handsome Steve Edison (Mathew McConaughey) is tied to Fran Donelly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras), one of Mary's most promising clients. In the meantime Salvatore (Alex Rocco), Mary's concerned father, tries to inspire her to consider her childhood inamorato Massimo (Justin Chambers), who just arrived from Italy. Torn between acting sensibly and fulfilling her long suppressed dreams of marrying, Mary must first determine which love is the one destined for her.The Wedding Planner exploits the physical beauty of its star (Lopez) and emphasizes her character's style and professionalism at work, while defining her personality as that of a free-spirited, down-to-earth person who enjoys dancing and playing Bingo with her father and his elderly friends. Similarly, her costar (McConaughey) is depicted as a good-looking, sensitive man who enjoys his work as a pediatrician. However, the film's secondary characters, especially Mary's family, friends and coworkers, are sketchy and mostly inconsequential. Thus, The Wedding Planner creates a story that solely revolves around the coupling of its two main characters; a choice which makes The Wedding Planner's plot extremely predictable, although at times amusing. While the plot complications are limited to the unavailability of either of the two main characters (where Steve is unable to abandon his prior commitments and Mary is ready to take up new ones), The Wedding Planner is most enjoyable when it creates romantic settings for its lovesick characters.

Just watching the previews, you pretty much have a good idea what's going to happen in the end.  But unlike many romantic comedies, this is not predictable by the minute.  The characters are likable and charming, and you get quite engrossed in them.  The actors are charming as well.  Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McCoughnahey are equally good and have a fine chemistry.  The scenes, in general, are handled in a sweet-natured fashion without becoming nauseatingly sentimental.  The opening scene is very original and made me laugh.  In the first scene, we get an idea of how Mary (Lopez) plans her weddings, staging them like a secret service operation, strapping wires to the bride and groom, feeding them suggestions as they walk down the aisle and making sure all the guests are in order pronto.  There are certain moments of sitcom stupidity.  There's a scene where Steve (McCoughnahey) gets his hand stuck to a statue's privates.  The comedy was badly timed and the scene appeared quite lame.  A similar joke was used in Rodney Dangerfield's Meet Wally Sparks, but was done in a much more structured manner and spawned hilarious results.  About the member of the cast who I felt was a little hammy was Alex Rocco as Mary's Sicilian father.  His accent comes and goes, and in some scenes he struggles so much with it that he starts talking like someone with down syndrome.  Fred Willard has a short but funny, scene-stealing role (when hasn't Willard stolen the show?) as a ballroom dance teacher.  There are some moments in the plot that are forced and created simply to move the film along, so we can quickly arrive at the juicy climax.  One of the subplots involves Mary's father trying to fix his daughter up with this silly, thick-accented Sicilian cassanova.  He wants her to get married to him, but she refuses.  Throughout the film, they don't seem to have any more than a friendly bond.  Yet later in the film, he makes a sweet proposal and Mary actually agrees to marry him.  The ending is far-fetched and over-the-top, and though I can't discuss it you've probably seen this ending before.  One thing I have to credit the writers for is refusing to make Fran (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras--Man, is she sooooo beautiful!!!) a total b**ch, like they would in most films of a similiar plot.  The way the formula goes is the guy's engaged this girl, while another girl captures his heart.  But the girl he's engaged to is usually so unlikable that you wonder why he wanted to marry her in the first place.  I'm glad they didn't take that cheap route.  Even Fran has a certain charm to her character.  The charming characters and the charming actors are really what makes this movie worth seeing.  Yes, it's pretty much (though less than usual) a formula romantic comedy, but a likable one because of the way we're captured by the people on screen.  This is not a great film, it has its dull moments, it has its silly moments, but it's often a fun and pleasant movie experience.  You'll fall in love with The Wedding Planner.My score  7 (out of 10)         "},{"Title":"Cant give it negative","Date":"11 December 2002","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Seriously, this movie gets about a negative 20.

As I have said before, Jennifer Lopez has such a beautiful feminine figure that I would prefer to see her as the romantic lead as opposed to most other Hollywood actresses working today. McConaughey is of course sexy with a laid-back charm, but that's just who he is.This particular romantic comedy isn't all that funny, but the writers did seem to know which elements were necessary and included them. We find out McConaughey's secret the same time Lopez does, which is good because it helps us identify with our main heroine and we don't have to sit uncomfortably before the characters do. They also gave us another man - he's supposed to provide comic relief, and I did at least enjoy him. We also need to dislike the fianc√©e. Cast Bridgette Wilson and make her a stuck-up snob, so that is easily accomplished.One thing that I found that The Wedding Planner has over lesser romantic comedies, is genuine chemistry between the leads. Although it's certainly lacking in the comedy, I found the romance tangible.

Matthew McConaughey is charming as the conflicted Steve, and expertly plays both his character's dry, cynical side and his boyish joyfulness. The two play against one another well, unlike the boring Fran, whose idea of the perfect wedding song is Olivia Newton-John's I Honestly Love You, and who can't seem to find one legitimate reason why she wants to marry Steve in the first place.As there are no other true funny characters, Massimo is perhaps intended to provide the film's comic relief, but his humor flows less from witty screen writing and masterful delivery and more from the director's mistaken assumption that every line a character delivers in broken English must be funny. Overall, The Wedding Planner does a good job of fulfilling audience expectations and creating characters that, while likable, are simply rom-com archetypes. The true romantic, unsatisfied with paltry declarations of love and empty representations of it, hopes for a bit more.Read my full review here thecorrelationfilmblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/29/my-best-friends- weddingthe-wedding-planner/ "},{"Title":"A cute predictable romantic comedy","Date":"19 October 2010","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" OK so I saw this a few years ago on TV and it was on last night so I decided to watch it because I liked Jennifer Lopez in Maid in Manhattan and I am a hopeless romantic.The wedding planner is about a young woman named Mary Flores(J-Lo) who is an ambitious and hardworking wedding planner who tries to create the perfect wedding for her clients. One day she accidentally gets her hight heel shoe stuck in a manhole and a taxi man drops his ice cream in the car and hits a bin that nearly kills Mary. Suddenly a handsome doctor named Steve(Eddie)Edison comes to sweep her off her feet and to her rescue and she is smitten by him,but the problem is his engaged to be married to another woman who happens to be Mary's clients(Oh No).Anyway while his fianc√© goes off for a week Mary spends some more time with Steve and she begins to fall in love with him. Mary of course is supposed to be engaged to Marcello(Justin Chambers who was in Greys Anatomy as Alex who is sporting a fake Italian accent that is so bad you couldn't help but laugh). Of course you know that she ends up with Steve in the end which is so cute yet kinda wrong as she stoled someone else's fianc√©e who was so stupid she decides to not marry him after and goes off on their honeymoon on their own.I think Hollywood is running out of ideas when it comes to making Romcoms as they are loosely based on the same thing again and again.Having said the above I thought it was a cute Rom com that will have you either loving it or hating it. Matthew McConnaghey was hot in this and J-Lo was a bit wooden in some parts but still she's just acting like the same character again and again.Nothing new here but still worth watching on a lazy afternoon.7/10 "},{"Title":"Her best friends wedding...","Date":"11 June 2001","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSMary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) is a wedding planner and  single.

Also, she plays an Italian, though she is obviously Hispanic. You definitely have to suspend disbelief for those points.

I guess if you go into a romantic comedy starring J.Lo expecting brilliance you deserve some disappointment.There isn't much to this movie.  Jennifer Lopez is (guess what?) a wedding planner.  She falls in love with Matthew McConaughey (the groom) of the big wedding she is putting on, and hilarity ensues.  Ok, maybe not hilarity, but I did really laugh out loud a few times.  There's good chemistry between J. Lo and Matthew McConaughey, which probably turned a few lackluster scenes into something I enjoyed.  The old movie on the lawn scene was nice, and McConaughey is charming.There aren't any spoilers I can throw at you, because, well, if you can't figure out how this movie ends before you pop the tape in the VCR then you don't see a lot of movies.  There isn't much original here, but if you're looking to toss back a few beers, look at some beautiful people, and not have to think too hard, this is your movie.Worth a look!

Written by Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis.  Starring Jennifer Lopez, Matthew McConaughey, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras. Running Time 100 minutes.    PG-13Ah romance! They meet. They fall in love. They are kept  apart by circumstances of the plot. And finally, by the time we reach the bottom of our popcorn boxes, they get back together again. Whether it's Gable and Colbert in 1934, or Lopez and McConaughey in 2001, we love romantic comedies. But let's face it, some are better than others (and few are better than Frank Capra's Oscar-winning classic, It Happened One Night).Mary Fiore (Lopez) is a whiz of a wedding planner who seems to be leading the glamorous good life, until you learn that she spends her off hours watching Antiques Road Show or playing scrabble with her father (Alex Rocco), a first generation Italian. While hurrying across a San Francisco street one day, her Gucci pump gets caught in a grate just as a runaway dumpster hurtles towards her. The white-coated white knight who comes to her rescue is pediatrician Steve Edison (McConaughey), and thus the familiar cycle of the romantic comedy is set in motion. This cute meet is followed by a cute date, her first in four years (if you can believe that of a Lopez character!). Then, of course, come the complications He is about to be married and she is the one who has been hired to plan it; and her own marriage is being arranged by her determined dad.In the best romantic comedies, the filmmakers set up interesting and believable barriers for the characters to overcome on their way to the Big Kiss. In this film, the question is Why they don't just get together right away? The answer contrived plotting won't let them. One doubts, for example, that a character as smart as Mary would even consider consenting to her father's meddlesome matchmaking.But rather than tell a compelling story, the filmmakers seem satisfied to simply provide an attractive vehicle for the two stars, and to furnish a few good laughs along the way. The attraction of the leads is unquestionable, and that alone has filled theaters with admiring fans. Supporting characters, though not fully developed, provide a full measure of amusement Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough, rescued from canceled TV shows, are hilarious as the newly rich, tipsy parents of McConaughey 's would-be bride (Wilson-Sampras). The direction of the film is snappy, with accomplished camera work, brisk editing and lively choreography during the forties-style dance scenes. The look of the film is also greatly enhanced by its San Francisco setting.So, if you want to see two of today's good looking stars looking good, see this film. If you want to see an excellent romantic comedy, rent It Happened One Night.Rating 2 stars out of 4###  "},{"Title":"Highly enjoyable","Date":"2 March 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I have to admit, going into the theater, I didn't think that this movie would be very good.

It would make for a good date movie, or if you want a movie that does not require a lot of thought. The problem with this kind of film is that 1) most of the material has already been seen countless times before, and 2) it is pretty forgettable and undeserving. Adam Shankman, choreographer of over two dozen previous productions, directs a week story by Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis, and the film's overall failure is due to only a few script deficiencies. With a bit more work, The Wedding Planner could have succeeded.Jennifer Lopez plays Mary, you guessed it, a wedding planner. Mary is an extremely busy woman, directing weddings like a traffic cop and doing a great job at that. Surprisingly, Mary is currently single-but of course she is. If she was married, how could we have a romantic comedy without the main character thirsting for a consistent love life. Her father (Alex Rocco) has found a solution to her lack of affection he picked a young man for her to wed, an Italian childhood acquaintance named Massimo (Justin Chambers, a Calvin Klein model). Naturally, Mary does not want to marry this man, so her complicated life continues.Mary's business life soars. She takes her boss into allowing her plan and execute the wedding of a successful Internet entrepreneur named Fran Donolly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras), and if the wedding is a hit, she will be promoted. Fran's fianc√© is a handsome and charming pediatrician named Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey), who is also the person who just saved Mary from a collision with a runaway dumpster. The ironic thing is that Steve and Mary exchanged feelings for each other the night before, and Mary is now furious that he would allow her to fall for him if he is already engaged. To make matters even worse, Fran knows nothing about this, and neither Mary or Steve plan on filling her in on this little incident.So far so good-we may have had something if the movie continued with the entertaining first act. The first act works well, except for a few unconvincing character traits (Mary spends her free time playing Scrabble on a team with old people), the Lopez character is developed well, and her need for a romantic playmate is clear. When we learn that Steve is Fran's fianc√©, it is actually an effective moment because of a dance scene following, which is one of the movies best. In the amusing tango sequence McConaughey and Lopez share their thoughts about unusual circumstances. It is here when the two develop their elegant romantic chemistry, one of the movie's best factors.Unfortunately The Wedding Planner does not contain a positive second act. It is a blend of character clich√©s and plot contrivances that are so obvious they are often agonizing. Steve arrives whenever the plot requires his presence, and Fran frequently disappears so the two romantics can spend time together. It is clear after the setup the story does not know where to go. The script gets into an area where nothing really happens, yet the characters find themselves in unfunny situation after another, simply to kill time. In one of these comic situations, Steve gets his hand glued to a marble male statue's genitals. The incident has potential, but the payoff is ineffective. We have also seen this joke before, in the unpopular 1997 Rodney Dangerfield comedy Meet Wally Sparks. That movie knew where to travel with such humor, The Wedding Planner has Mary ungluing Steve with solvent located in her purse. Help me please, I can't stop laughing.Matthew McConaughey's character comes from nowhere, and is left undeveloped. That is also distressing because both he and Lopez are convincing and charismatic. They are the only things keeping us interested when the story takes an unexpected turn involving the right people separately marrying the wrong people. This contrivance does actually spark interest in the sagging story, but it also feels as if the plot needed a serious treatment for being quite boring, so that's what the script provides. The only thing the script doesn't provide for its characters is a passable excuse for why everyone in the movie seems to be resistant to using common sense.

The main character of this film, Mary Fiore, is a San Francisco wedding planner who falls in love with Steve, the fianc√© of one of her clients, initially without realising who he is.You can work out the rest of the plot from here. Mary and Steve end up marrying one another.You can call that a spoiler if you want. I prefer to call it the inexorable logic of two of the iron laws of romantic comedy.Law One states that there is no obstacle to the happiness of the loving couple that cannot be overcome, however formidable that obstacle might seem. That obstacle can be-He's rich, she's poor. (Maid in Manhattan, also starring Jennifer Lopez) He's poor, she's rich. (Notting Hill). He's white, she's black. (Life Size) He's afraid of commitment (Four Weddings and a Funeral) She's afraid of commitment (Runaway Bride) He's old enough to be her father. (Innumerable examples) He and she have taken an initial dislike to one another. (No Reservations , You've got Mail, and all the way back to Elizabeth and Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, if not Beatrice and Benedict in Much Ado about Nothing) He and she already have one failed marriage to each other behind them. (A popular plot in the thirties and forties- His Girl Friday, The Philadelphia Story- and it still occasionally turns up in modern films like Sweet Home Alabama). She's a lesbian. (Chasing Amy) She's a fruitcake. (Addicted to Love).Mind you, in that film he's a bit of a fruitcake as well, so perhaps they deserve one another. She's a witch. (Bewitched) She's a mermaid. (Splash). He's human, she's an alien from outer space. (My Stepmother is an Alien).The above examples will show that there is virtually no objection to marriage which cannot be overcome with the aid of some creative writing. About the only factors which Hollywood still recognises as a Just Cause and Impediment these days are he's black, she's white and she's old enough to be his mother, or nearly so. The first of these may soon go, given an increasingly liberal attitude towards racial matters; the second may take longer to overcome. (It was, of course, the subject- matter of Prime, but that was a rare example of a rom-com with an unhappy ending). He's already engaged to someone else certainly isn't going to deter the scriptwriter.Law Two states that first name above the title always gets the girl. Or boy. Nobody is going to make a romantic comedy in which an international megastar like J-Lo loses her man to Bridgette Wilson- Sampras, better known as a model than as an actress but best known as the wife of a top tennis player. (Bridgette plays Fran, Steve's original fianc√©e). And we all know that a leading man like Matthew McConaughey will never be a loser in love if his only rival is an actor as obscure as Justin Chambers. (Justin plays Massimo, the Italian immigrant whom Mary's Italian immigrant father would prefer her to marry).I could just about have overlooked The Wedding Planner's utter predictability were it not for the fact that all the main characters are so unsympathetic. Steve is a two-timing love rat. Fran is attractive but rather cold and remote. Massimo is good looking but a bit of an idiot. On the other hand, he is not such an idiot as to deserve the heartless way in which Mary treats him, even though he is quite genuinely in love with her. Quite apart from her behaviour towards Massimo, Mary comes across as a complete airhead, the sort of girl who would rather risk being crushed by a runaway dumpster than abandon one of her precious shoes. (She only survives because Steve is on hand to pull her away).Jennifer Lopez has occasionally turned in decent acting performances in films like Angel Eyes, An Unfinished Life and even Maid in Manhattan, but too often she falls well short of her best. The Wedding Planner is not her worst film- that must be the so-bad-it's-funny Anaconda- but among those which I have seen it must vie with Enough for the position of next-to-worst. She does not seem to put any effort into her acting, content to stroll through the film with her mind firmly fixed upon her paycheque. She was, for the first but not the last time in her career, nominated for a Worst Actress Razzie Award. (To date J-Lo has five Razzie nominations under her belt). None of her colleagues, however, seem to be much better; McConaughey seems very bland and ordinary for a man who supposedly has two beautiful women fighting over him. One reviewer writes that she has never come across a man who likes The Wedding Planner, which doesn't surprise me at all. What does surprise me is her implication that she has managed to find women who do like it. 3/10 "},{"Title":"Nope.","Date":"14 August 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Wow.

Jennifer Lopez plays a wedding planner who spends a romantic evening with a male who is engaged to a woman she is planning a wedding for. She is furious but we can certainly expect a cheerful reunion in the conclusion. Director Adam Shankman does his best with the low key material but he is labouring under formula material that never rises above stale bland storytelling. Prior to this his only credit is Cosmo's Tale but hopefully this isn't the direction he is heading. While Lopez is subdued in formula writing, Matthew McConaughey is hardly sympathetic. Anyone with an IQ can figure this situation out and they both play it out in full ignorance. Bridgette Wilson-Sampras plays the bride who is too understanding for her own bloody good. On one end she is being detached from a cheating louse, but on the other hand she is allowing Lopez to reap her mistakes. Of course, the whole film is one big mistake reaped upon all involved.

The script doesn't seem to deal with the situations at hand properly, and peters out to let the players make up unlikely scenarios as they go along. That being said, the viewer gets the general idea of why things happen the way they do, as it allows the charming characters to develop, like Jennifer Lopez's smart, likable portrayal of the title character and Matthew McConaughey's chance to play a role that fits him in the male opposite. Either take it or leave it, depending on what you think makes a romance good.

Typically, moderately-talented pop stars who long to get into movies fall on their keysters, but Lopez is rather adept at the job.  She seems to be aiming at the Julia Roberts market, ie. light romantic  rich-people comedies.  She's more believable than Julia Roberts in her parallel roles, probably because she's trying a little harder and hasn't yet developed any irritating tics. Matthew McConaughey and Bridget Wilson are much blander in comparison, but they do what they have to do.

Mary Fiore is a wedding planner, who finds out after almost kissing Steve that he is actually the groom-to-be of a big wedding she is planning.In addition to the fact that he doesn't bother to mention he is engaged when he flirts with her, he very rarely says anything nice to her throughout the entire movie.  He has an irritating drawl, and his mediocre looks can't make up for any of these things or explain what Mary's fascination is.  Still, it is apparent that she is in love with him, and although in her trade she is the best-of-the-best, she is having a hard time trying to plan a wedding in which he will marry another woman.The rest of the movie is just a drawn-out plot that keeps you in suspense while you wonder if she is going to end up with Steve at the end (the predictable ending), or another man who is in love with Mary, but whom Mary does not love back.There were many various annoyances in this movie, especially at the ending; I won't go into details as I don't want to spoil the ending, but let me tell you it was just plain dull.I have to admit Jennifer did a fine job of acting in this movie.

The movie was so boring and so cliche, I actually went to bed after it went off (it was 1000 mind you). Some parts were ok, like my mom cracked up at the statue scene and I did let out a little chuckle here and there, but something just didn't click.I'm usually up for anything when it comes to movies because they're my favorite past times and usually I like movies probably a lot of other people wouldn't like.

No, on second thoughts the only thing you need to know about the wedding planner is that it is astronomically, unbelievably extraordinarily, tedious.

A dislike for this character might make you hope more for the leads reunion but instead you guess that this character is probably going to get hurt.Director Shankman should go back to choreography unless he finds a better story to showcase any talent he may have.People may well dismiss my critism as the Wedding Planner is a chick-flick and I am a guy.

As he left, Matthew McConaughey stepped into the frame and consequently, the tonsil hockey duties fell to him.Mary Fiore (Lopez) is a successful wedding planner on the brink of staging the biggest wedding of her successful career. Whilst out and about in downtown San Francisco, her shoe becomes stuck in a sewer duct, and a mysterious stranger Steve (McConaughey) comes to her rescue, saving her from a runaway dumpster.After a whirlwind day together that culminates in an almost kiss in the park, Mary thinks that Steve may be &#145;the one'. That is until she discovers he's actually the groom to be in the wedding she's supposed to be staging.Released around Valentine's in the states, The Wedding Planner is a typical February 14th movie. Predictably it was a huge hit over the pond as Jennifer Lopez became the first person to have a number one album and film at the same time. Fame comes at a cheap price these days though, and the case of Jennifer simply underlines this.Her comic timing is sorely off and as such many of the jokes in this rom-com fall flat on their face. The credibility of her character is just as questionable too. How could someone like Mary who is obsessed with weddings not even have a boyfriend when she has perfect looks like Lopez's? It simply doesn't add up.With this in mind, the plot itself is simply not enough to sustain a two-hour movie either. Indeed Mary's &#145;fianc√©' Salvatore is a wholly irrelevant character and seems only to be there to add an extra half hour to the running time.You soon get the feeling that if Julia Roberts had been cast opposite McConaughey then we might have something special on our hands.

Now, whether or not this is a major health concern for the average M&M eater is debatable, but Doctor (Doctor!)

Not only does Mary fall for this inane bit of 'logic,' she starts throwing away non-brown M&Ms as well.  She is presented in the movie as a level-headed, quick thinking, intelligent woman.

A friend of mine once called her the sexiest woman alive, but to me she seems like a mini with a trailer hitch made for a semi truck. She's not bad looking by any means, but really, are her looks worth the one billion dollars she has insured it for? Anyway I digress. As you probably know from the deluge of trailers flooding your television, The Wedding Planner is the new romantic comedy staring Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey. Lopez plays Mary, a Wedding Planner so good that she makes as much business for her firm as all the other wedding planners put together times five. She's also a total neat freak and organizer, a person who folds her shirts and blouses around a piece of sheet plastic to keep them flat. She might plan weddings but her own heart was broken when her fiance screwed her over. She meets Dr. Steve Edison (McConaughey) when he saves her life. They then proceed to go out on a sort of date and he fails to mention that he is getting married in three months. Of course it turns out that his wedding is being planned by Mary (what a shock) and it is also the most important job of her career. Most of this is straight from the trailer, no surprises. And for the most part that is the way that the rest of the movie goes, no surprises. I find it interesting that Lopez would choose a project like this however, because while not all of her movies are all that great, most of them are interesting and challenge norms (think The Cell, Out of Sight or U-Turn not Anaconda). The unfortunate thing about The Wedding Planner is that there are a lot of good character interactions here, but they are diverted and pushed aside because the female lead has to get together with the male lead in the end. The relationship between Dr. Steve and his fiance Fran (played by Bridgette Wilson-Sampras whom you may remember as Sonya in Mortal Kombat) is portrayed quite well. Although the problems in Fran and Steve's relationship are subtle and not given enough screen time,  some of their scenes near the end of the movie work quite well. Along those same lines Massimo (played by Justin Chambers) does a good job endearing himself on the audience as the other man in Mary's life. By the end of the film you are quite ready to root for him over Dr. Steve. The romance between Steve and Mary however is quite a bit different. I never really saw the spark between the two of them. All I came away from the romantic scenes between the leads was that Steve wasn't ready to get married to Fran. The only real surprise is that, contrary to its assembly line style formula, there are quite a few funny scenes in The Wedding Planner. In fact, except for some of the labored romance scenes between Lopez and McConaughey almost every scene has some funny moments in it. Especially good in their roles as comic relief are Fran's parents played by Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough. Also Mary's friends in her Scrabble club lend a few funny moments. While I certainly wasn't busting my gut laughing, the comedy made me forget about the tepid romance through most of the movie. So should you see this movie? Well, if you're hard up for a date movie, and don't mind some gratuitously placed Lopez music, go for it. The slightly above average comedy makes the so-so romance bearable. But only go to this one as a last resort, there are plenty of good movies in the theaters right now and nine to twelve bucks is a lot to spend on slightly above average comedy.

They have a lovely evening together, one that almost ends in a kiss. Yet, each of them hesitate and the moment is gone. Soon after, Mary learns why Steve pulled back from her....he is the fianc√© of go-getter Fran! Should Mary continue to plan the wedding, even though she feels drawn to handsome Steve?

One look at Lopez in a high-necked black dress and rose-colored sweater and you will realize that true beauty is elegant, and not a mere flash of flesh. J-Lo also gives a sweet performance as the lady looking for an earth-moving love. McConaghay is fine as the mixed-up groom and Wilson has her tole as a spoiled heiress down to a T. The rest of the cast is also nice. The whole production looks very attractive and eye-catching, to say the least, from the scenes in the park to a winery setting and on to Lopez' lovely apartment. If you love romantic comedies, this one should be one your top twenty list, absolutely. But, even if you think romcoms are for chicks only, take a chance with this one. You might be surprised at how much fun these movies can be, in between the required lovelorn gazes, of course.

I'm as ready as the next sap to buy love at first sight, regardless of trumped-up circumstance, but when the romance novel plot complications settle in, scattering rational thought to the winds, I grow weary of bosom-heaving lines like what if what I think is great really is great, but not as great as something greater? It's a darn good thing Fran was thinking along the same lines, too--huh, Steve?--or you'd have been SOL along with J-Lo! If nothing else, The Wedding Planner provides grist for conversation centered on the various stupidities of the characters, and what you would have done differently if caught up in such an unlikely situation. Beyond that, I'm sorry to say The Wedding Planner is just another frothy confection, a candy for the heart that's all empty calories.Parenthetically, McConaughey does a much better romantic comedy turn opposite Kate Hudson in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, a film I'd give at least a point higher than this one, and might actually be willing to sit through a second viewing with the right companion.

Of course they instantly fall in love with each other. However, it so happens that Matthew McConaughey is engaged to someone else, and what is more, this other woman has engaged Jennifer Lopez to plan her wedding! What are we to do? It goes without saying that true love must have its destiny, however improbable, and just to underline that they are made for each other we have another contrived scene in which Matthew McConaughey has to rescue J-Lo from a bolting horse. On their return I was interested in the posture they chose to come home. Usually when people ride two up on a horse they do it as pillion riders do on a motorbike, one behind the other. In this case, however, J-Lo was sitting in front of Matthew McConaughey, entirely blocking his view, but giving her the chance to sit on his *****, which is much more important. I wondered how they would resolve it, since as the heroine J-Lo could hardly just pinch someone else's bridegroom, because she has to be a sympathetic character. In the end they thought of a very simple solution Matthew McConaughey's girlfriend just decided she didn't want to marry him after all, so that was all right. Do you see?

In what may be a most telling scene, when the main character has an accident and wakes up in the hospital, she just happens to be in the pediatric ward; perhaps giving those to whom this insipid drivel would appeal something with which to relate?  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  In regards to `The Wedding Planner,' directed (more or less) by Adam Shankman, that last comment should've been reserved for later, but by then I may have had to make it `cliche-ridden' insipid drivel.  Actually, early on this film seemed to have some promise; but then the opening credits ended and it was all downhill from there.  It may ring of paranoia, but the makers of this movie-- though unable to deny responsibility since they did, in fact, make it-- may have been able to make a case that they had been the victims of a conspiracy of sorts, beginning with the cast they assembled to bring it all to life.  I can think of no other movie that boasts such a grossly unappealing, miscast bunch of actors, beginning with Alex Rocco as Salvatore, the father of Mary Fiore, the character played by Jennifer Lopez.  Mull that over for just a moment, if you will; Rocco as Lopez's father.... 	For the life of me, I cannot understand Jennifer Lopez; she's beautiful and talented, and seemingly bent on making as many mistakes, career-wise, as she possibly can.  Perhaps I should make that `artistic' mistakes, since with her singing career and being given the opportunity to make movies (even ones like this) she is probably going to be very materially well-off, even if she continues to do nothing of artistic merit for the rest of her life.  Maybe when the teenyboppers have grown tired of her (which shouldn't be too long) and she realizes that she will only be able to invade Brittany Spears territory so far, she will go back to what she is really good at, making movies like `Selena,' and `Out Of Sight,' in which she demonstrated what kind of acting chops she has.  How ironic that in this film she plays a wedding planner, when what she needs in real life is a `career planner' for herself.  It just seems like such a shame that `J. Lo' has taken the fast-track to fame and fortune instead of employing her myriad gifts to better purpose.  That she looks attractive in this film cannot be denied, but neither can it be denied that as far as her acting, it was nothing more than a walk-through for her. 	Matthew McConaughey, meanwhile, winds up in even murkier waters than Lopez here, with his portrayal of Dr. Steve `Eddie' Edison, the character whom circumstances bring into contact with Mary Fiore at a pivotal point in his life.  He is engaged to Fran (Bridgette Wilson), but begins to have second thoughts about it after his encounter with Mary.  The plot line gets pretty complicated after that, and for anyone who has trouble keeping up with it, I can only suggest that they confer with some of those currently residing in that pediatric ward.  Any charm, charisma or screen presence McConaughey has must have been checked at the gate when he signed on for this one, because a more flat, uninspired performance you are unlikely to find without looking real hard.  Hold that thought; can anyone say Chris O'Donnell in `The Bachelor?'  And the lack of chemistry between McConaughey and Lopez is stupefying; interestingly enough, he has even less with Wilson.  The producers would've had to bring in truckloads of rocks and flint to ignite any sparks on this set. 	The supporting cast includes Justin Chambers (Massimo), Judy Greer (Penny), Joanna Gleason (Mrs. Donolly), Charles Kimbrough (Mr. Donolly), Fred Willard (Basil St. Mosely), Kathy Najimy (Geri) and Kevin Pollak as Dr. Dojny (but don't blink or you'll miss him).  Unfortunately, the best thing that can be said about `The Wedding Planner' is that it makes even the mediocre movies look good.  It's always a huge disappointment to see talent, the likes of which are involved here, go to waste in such an unmitigated debacle as this.  It would be so satisfying to see Jennifer Lopez, especially, in a project worthy of what she has to offer, and of which she is capable; as an audience, we can only hope that she gets some good advice about the direction of her career, and that she will have the guts to listen to and act upon it.

I hate most of Hollywood romantic comedies at the 2000s. And this one gives me no motive to think not ! Mainly it's in the script; seems the classic repetitive mistake in this kind of movies nowadays. Look at the situation, it's old but talented and creatively new this time; wedding planner who has no wedding plane for herself since her love life is empty, then prince charming comes along but he's a groom in one of her weddings. However, the whole time specifically from the horse problem to the double fiasco of the end's 2 weddings is one big crappy writing. The script didn't care about what's deep down the characters or establishing the idea of commitment or even making some fun thrilling time out of the in-the-nick-of-time-upheaval at the climatic sequence !While watching a scene like the one in which (Matthew McConaughey)'s character is trying to ask his bride do you really love me ? I was about to burst laughing indeed, saying well, this scriptwriter makes everything pretty easy, there is nothing cogent about her alteration after because of this talk ! (why he didn't say it earlier for god's sake ?!!). And (McConaughey) in the same scene even said something like our days in college.. !! Damn, we didn't know about their history together till now (or after !). And this father's move at the end ?? He's the last one on Earth to object to this fixed marriage, he himself had very successful one, and he didn't show us concern about the opposite way along the whole movie either. His last deed wasn't persuasive, like a move was done by the scriptwriter NOT his character ! Let alone other matters like when the lead was convincing the hesitating bride that she must marry using strange lines like you're timeless !! What is that ? The whole scene was corny. And truly as a romantic comedy I didn't run into comedy much, it had already some supporting characters and ironic situations that can make laughs but it didn't utilize any.The direction made it kind of smooth movie. The whole time is covered with pellucid diaphanous mantilla. But the music was just sonic comments without a character, being too soft to provocative extent sometimes ! It's obvious how they were using it to veil some weak situations (I wasn't satisfied with matter like the athletic competition between McConaughey and Lopez's alleged fianc√©) anyhow, they always think that with cool soundtrack they can get away with it ! Furthermore minor annoying points  (McConaughey)'s hair looks pathetic all the time. (Bridgette Wilson) is not a good actress in the first place. And (Justin Chambers) as (Massimo) was so young for proposing to Lopez, looking 10 years younger than her while he's supposed to be her childhood companion !.I loved the movie's first 20 minutes. Though still the gorgeous presence of (Jennifer Lopez) is the best about it (at least that lasted for the end !). She becomes better actress with every movie, maybe she wasn't the best drunken here, but she managed to do it wholly fine, the thing is that the whole script here was not a fine one originally.The movie finally has one great scene; where (Lopez) got to dance with (McConaughey) that inflaming dance while being honest about their relationship. All the elements (including Lopez and her astonishing beauty, dancing, and that red dress) just collaborated to make such a solid, hot, attractive cinematic moment. Ohh, if only the whole movie was like this !To end my review I only have one very old worn phrase, but the movie forces me to say it  This story has been done so many times before, and better too.

Basically Mary Fiore (Razzie nominated Jennifer Lopez) is a hard working and well organised wedding planner, who can make any wedding a spectacular event, oh, and she enjoys Scrabble. One day, she is rescued from a near accident by doctor Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey), and it is obvious after dancing and a near kiss that she has fallen for him. But there's a problem, he's engaged to one of Mary's biggest clients, Fran Donolly (I Know What You Did Last Summer's Bridgette Wilson), and even worse, Steve's hired her to plan the wedding. Not only is Mary finding this hard to do, but Steve might be having doubts that he wants to marry Fran at all, oh, and Mary might have accepted a proposal from childhood friend Massimo (Justin Chambers). So it comes to the wedding day, and thankfully, Steve tells Fran his doubts, and she feels the same too, and Mary pulls out of her wedding, and it ends happily ever after with them dancing. Also starring Judy Greer as Penny, Alex Rocco as Salvatore, Joanna Gleason as Mrs. Donolly, Charles Kimbrough as Mr. Donolly, Fred Willard as Basil St. Mosely , Kevin Pollak as Dr. John Dojny and Kathy Najimy as Geri. I can see what the critics mean about this being like a Julia Roberts film, it is close to the premise of My Best Friend's Wedding, just giving us the ending we could have had, and making it okay. Lopez is an alright female lead, plenty of chances to view her curves, and McConaughey has his small moments as the male lead, and even though there isn't a lot to laugh at, it is worth a go, at least once.

This winsome tale of woo about two wrong for each other couples delivers bouquets of cheers and tears without either humiliating its congenial cast or insulting audiences. Novice director Adam Shankman, previously a choreographer for films like George of the Jungle, Boogie Nights, and Mission to Mars, transforms an old-fashioned Pride and Prejudice storyline with stock characters in clich√© situations into a briskly-paced, modern day yarn.The Wedding Planner boasts charismatic performances, witty repartee, and farcical horseplay that should offend few. Actress-turned-pop diva Jennifer Lopez snaps back from last year's abysmal, avant-garde, psychological chiller The Cell and displays a knack for sophisticated humor. Imagine My Best Friend's Wedding rewritten so that the heroine wins Mr. Right, and you have a good idea about what kind of antics abound in The Wedding Planner. In the title role as Mary Fiore, Lopez plays the most sought after wedding consultant in San Francisco. Not only does she attract cream of the crop couples with big bucks to blow, but she also orchestrates her weddings with the same attention to detail that NASA observes during a shuttle launch countdown. Equipped with a microphone headset so she can talk to the best man throughout a wedding toast reception, Mary epitomizes perfectionism at its foremost. Nothing fazes this fastidious female. She never breaks a sweat solving problems. If the bride's father cannot face the prospect of giving up his daughter, Mary knows how to snap him into shape. If somebody's head blocks her wedding videographer's cameras, Mary dispatches an assistant to escort said 'big head' to another seat. If the bride herself develops cold feet, Mary restores the former's sagging confidence with a speech so intentionally corny that no woman could resist it. Woman marvel at her cool, imperturbable ability to stage these nuptials. They dream about the ultra-romantic life that Mary must surely live. Wrong! As a single, career-oriented, workaholic woman, Mary has few friends. Moreover, she hasn't dated in two years and dines at home along on covered dishes while she watches PBS-TV's Antique Roadshow. According to Mary, some women marry while others plan marriages. She belongs to the latter category and maintains an apparent quasi-monastic lifestyle. Mary still smarts from having been abandoned at the altar. Consequently, she spends her free time cleaning her drapes and playing Scrabble with her Italian-immigrant father Salvatore (Alex Rocco of Freebie and the Bean) and his geriatric friends at a nursing home.While she is supervising the wedding-of-a-lifetime for wealthy Internet entrepreneur Fran Donnelly (Bridget Wilson-Sampras of Mortal Combat) that will make her a partner in her boss's business, Mary has an unforeseen accident. Crossing a street, she snags one of her Gucci high heels in a manhole cover. Simultaneously, a taxi cab driver sideswipes a huge garbage dumpster. The leviathan dumpster lurches downhill toward our helpless heroine as she struggles futilely to extract her footwear. Pediatrician Dr. Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey) knocks Mary out of the way of the runaway dumpster seconds before it would have creamed her. Mary faints, and Edison checks her into his kids' clinic and checks her out. Meanwhile, Mary's hilariously hare-brained assistant, Penny Nicholson (Judy Greer of What Women Want), rushes to see Mary after the clinic calls her. She nearly faints when she sees handsome Steve Edison. Playing matchmaker, scatterbrained Penny suggests that Steve join Mary and her for a movie at Golden Gate Park. At the last minute, Penny backs out, leaving our heroine with the charming pediatrician. They dance to an out-of-doors screening of Two Tickets to Broadway (1951) starring Tony Martin and Janet Leigh. During their dance, they come perilously close to kissing each other.Of course, Mary walks on clouds until she discovers to her shock that Steve is none other than Fran's bridegroom! Ironically, Fran gets so bogged down in her own company's affairs that she convinces her new best friend Mary and her future husband Steve to coordinate the small details while she leaves town on business. Initially, Mary fusses at Steve for behaving so boorishly, but he soon overcomes her objections. He claims that he wasn't cheating on Fran when he saw the movie with Mary at the park. Neither can take their orbs off each other, until a conscientious Mary sends poor Steve packing. Our heroine refuses to destroy Fran's wedding. She regards Fran as her friend and valiantly shuts up the door in Steve's face. The recurring problem and part of the humor is that Steve keeps rescuing Mary from one accident after another until Steve realizes his impending marriage to Fran may spell doom. Meanwhile, Mary's sweet, well-intentioned father sets her up with another guy, Massimo (Justin Chambers of The Musketeer), a shy, hunky Italian immigrant who Mary met as a child when she spent a summer in Sicily. Massimo looks and acts like a woman's dream come true. Since she cannot marry Dr. Steve, Mary settles for Massimo in a justice of the peace ceremony.Like those classic Spencer Tracy & Katherine Hepburn comedies of yesteryear, The Wedding Planner chronicles the inevitable twists and turns of the guy-gets-gal, guy-loses-gal, guy-wins-gal-back formula. Sentimental moviegoers will embrace this chaste, clean-minded but nevertheless entertaining matrimonial merriment. You've seen this kind of movie dozens of times, but an invigorating cast and agile scriptwriting provide it with enough fresh angles so The Wedding Planner doesn't seem as recycled as most second-rate romantic comedies. Director Adam Shankman keeps everything light and breezy when he isn't ridiculing various wedding ceremony customs.Make a date to see The Wedding Planner.

The title sounds like a weak ripoff of the enjoyable The Wedding Singer.  To my great surprise, The Wedding Planner is a vastly superior movie.  Opening with,perhaps, the longest single take since Touch of Evil, director Adam Shankman and Jennifer Lopez create a fresh look at a yet another control freak discovering she only BELIEVES she is in control. Like its star, Jennifer Lopez, The Wedding Planner is tightly constructed and quite engaging.  Lopez is excellent, even if her gestures are more Hispanic than Italian. More convincing as an Italian is Justin Chambers as Massimo, Lopez's lovesick childhood suitor.  One of the great strengths of Planner is that both Chambers and Brigette Wilson are so likeable, one roots for them as much as he does the leads.This movie is almost equally romantic-comedy-drama.  Anyone who views the outtakes will see that much of the drama was left on the cutting room floor (including Lopez's best scene).The Wedding Planner is not necessarily a movie I would want to see again, but it was certainly time well spent.

Only as of recently has her musical career exploded internationally, her focus on acting seems to be diverted elsewhere as her last few movies have been quite awful (ie. ANGEL EYES, U-TURN). Before her musical career took off, her movie roles were quite commendable (ie. OUT OF SIGHT, SELENA). For Jennifer, it is unfortunate that I feel she should have to choose between one career or the other because I don't think she can handle both. She is a great singer and she can be a great actress but it is apparent that she can't manage both at the same time. This mess of a movie is supposed to showcase her 'comedic' talents yet displays the worst side of her one-dimensional acting abilities.The trailers for this movie depicted THE WEDDING PLANNER to be a few hours of enjoyable romantic light fluff that anyone could enjoy on a lazy Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately, I turned this movie off half way through after my nerves finally gave in.Yes, Jennifer Lopez portrays a successful wedding planner who is successful in her career but apparently unlucky in love. That is of course until she has a 'run-in' with her knight in shining armor (dryly portrayed by Matthew McConaughey in a 'phone-in' role). The only problem here is that Matthew is getting married to one of her new clients and she may very well be doomed to a loveless life married to some loser from high school who used to pick on her. It's a no-brainer in figuring out how this movie will end.Yes, movies like SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING and FRENCH KISS were enjoyable romantic comedies. We all knew how they were going to end yet we enjoyed the two hour journey that we had to take in order to see the grand finale. Unfortunately for THE WEDDING PLANNER, the two hours are a rocky mess that tries to pair two unlikely characters with no chemistry whatsoever backed by a sound-track filled with Jennifer's own songs. The only thing I really enjoyed watching was the San Francisco scenery (how can one not love that city?)Usually when the grand finale in these romantic films happen, you generally leave the theater feeling warm and fuzzy inside or at least basically satisfied for the plot outcome of the characters. When THE WEDDING PLANNER finished, I could only think Good, I'm glad this garbage is over.For a generic romantic comedy, THE WEDDING PLANNER fails to deliver. It could have worked had the characters shared at least a little bit of chemistry, but I didn't even pick up that vibe from what I saw. The credits close with Jennifer's hit song, My Love Don't Cost A Thing and that generally tops off the point I raised at the beginning of my review - Jennifer needs to choose between singing or acting because her film career is beginning to suffer as a result.My Rating - 2 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Just Okay","Date":"17 September 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" This movie didn't do much for me.

His part was relatively small, but important and superbly done.Watch it if you want, but don't expect to be blown away or swept off your feet.

With an exclamation mark. It's boring, contrived, silly and not very funny at all. Its two main stars, Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey, share absolutely no sense of chemistry whatsoever. The plot allows for devilishly funny situations that never arise from the recycled and visibly tired script. It's like sitting through a rerun of an old movie you've seen a million times before. And not a very good movie, for that matter.JHo - I mean, JLo - plays Mary, a wealthy wedding planner (hence the title) and control freak who is lonely and neglected in real life, forming no relationships for herself. That is, until she meets a doctor (McConaughey), who rescues her after she gets her high heel stuck in a pot hole in the middle of a busy highway. (Don't ask.) He takes her out to a fair and they dance and almost kiss.Then she finds out that he's engaged. Not only that, but he's engaged to one of her closest and friends. And, to top it all off, he's also her newest client - she has to organize his upcoming wedding. Then, his fiancee flies out of town for a week, leaving the two flirters together to sort out the wedding, and perhaps fall in love with each other during the process. But that will mean breaking up the wedding, right? Matters don't help that Mary soon becomes engaged herself to a man she has known since childhood. Why? Who cares? It's all part of the contrived plot I was ranting about earlier.First problem The cast. JLo can't act. Not only that, there's no chemistry/sparks between her and McConaughey, who also can't act his way out of a paper bag (or from behind JLo's most famous behind, in this case). And she also can't handle the role of the Beautiful Lonely Single Female, a role Sandra Bullock can carry off because she doesn't act like a...well...JHo the entire time.I like romantic comedies, especially the entertaining and sweet kind. A romantic comedy doesn't have to wow me over with its plot or technical achievements; all I ask for are likable characters and an entertaining premise, recycled or not. Good evidence of this is Alex and Emma, a film I attended a screening of some small number of weeks ago. I enjoyed that film despite its many negative reviews because I found the characters sweet and the story entertaining. The Wedding Planner is neither. It is both annoying and revolting, with unlikable characters (who come off as selfish and whiny as opposed to generous and optimistic) and a bad bundle of jokes.And as I stated above, The Wedding Planner's premise is like a rerun of another old romantic comedy - but not a very good one. The woman who has it all together is lacking love in her life; when she finally finds true love she can't have it. Quoting Dr. Evil, Boo-frickety-hoo.The movie was directed by Adam Shankman, who has directed A Walk to Remember (2002) and Bringing Down the House (2003), the latter of which is very similar to this film and also quite unfunny at times. But at least Bringing Down the House had a top-notch cast, and at least it made me laugh - if only a handful of times. The Wedding Planner didn't make me laugh at all; it didn't make me care about its cute couple; it made me want to vomit. That's not a good trait for a romantic comedy that boasts how cute and funny it is. Quoting one of the most catchy taglines for a film ever, You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll hurl. Take away the laughing part and you've got a two-sentence summary of this terribly mediocre movie.2/5 stars.- John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Wedding bells play a different tune.","Date":"28 October 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Forget the hype.

It shares many of the typical scenes you'd expect, but the differences are in the details. In the first scene we meet Mary (Lopez), she is running around - cool and in control complete with headset, code words and a veritable utility belt of supplies - trying to pull together all the participants so that a person's wedding goes off without a hitch. It's quite a production and Mary (a name surely based on the verb) tackles it as if she's coaching a Super Bowel team. In typical fashion of these movies our single hero is constantly being pushed into finding someone and getting married by friends and family. All her romantic endeavors have been losers. But getting past this stock stuff the movie injects some depth to the characters. I like the basic connection it makes with the wedding planner being a women desensitized to romance. She views love as a utilitarian part of her job, something to be used and constructed, despite or because she is surrounded by it constantly. Yet it never seems to find her. She starts to believe again when she meets Steve (Matthew McConaughey) when he pushes her out of the way of a speeding dumpster of death - an action that looks like it did more damage then the dumpster would have. One thing leads to another and the events line up for the two of them. Complications arise, but hilarity doesn't quite ensue because the movie is never really funny. It sounds like a standard romantic comedy plot complication when Steve turns out to be a groom in one of the weddings Mary is planning. It would have worked out better if the movie had set up beforehand how falling for a groom was the cardinal sin of wedding planning. It doesn't and as a result the movie doesn't feel as realized as it could be. I forgive it because the pairing of Mary and Steve works. Lopez and McConaughey have chemistry. Their characters are actually interesting - particularly Steve - and they bond over things like ballroom dancing and M&Ms. That likable chemistry propels the rest of the movie. This movie has it's head slightly above the pack because it does take some time with it's characters. Not just the leads but even perennial b***h Bridgette Wilson as Steve's bride-to-be is given some warmth and charm. The characters follow the line the story gives them, but when crunch time comes they open up and reveal a depth that most romantic comedies would plaster over with sugary coating. Big credit to the screenwriters and director Adam Shankman who appear to respect their audience. They don't just lay out absurd things and expect women to gobble them up because that's what the genera does. Like many modern romantic comedies WP is afraid to be it's own entity. Shankman is often calling to mind old fashioned love stories. He overlays the score pervasively through the movie to give the feeling of a classic, but more often it just sounds like a cartoon or a Disney Channel sitcom. The constant music is a little distracting at times and I feared Shankman was going to throw in sound effects to punctuate the action. Many of the supposed comedy set pieces our couple find themselves in hit the floor with a thud. Like a scene involving a male statue and superglue. It also has the standard race-to-stop-the-wedding finale, but that shouldn't be a spoiler. Maybe this is the decline of expectations after seeing such rock bottom genera entries as My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Two Weeks Notice, but I did like this one. It doesn't give us anything new, but it's charming and cute and won't insult it's audience. But, in the end I still wasn't fully satisfied. It never swept me up in that charm and fairy tale sweetness that truly good old fashioned love stories should.

The film boasts a storyline so hoary and wheezy that one could probably trace its antecedents all the way back to that marvelous 1934 classic `It Happened One Night' &#150; if not indeed even further back than that.  It's the oldie about the bride-or-groom-to-be who discovers just at that crucial last moment, when all the guests have gathered for the wedding, that he or she is actually marrying the wrong person and that his or her real, honest-to-God genuine true love is just out there waiting in the wings ready for the taking.  `The Wedding Planner' doubles our pleasure by having TWO such disastrous weddings happening at the same time.Like far too many lazy romantic comedies, `The Wedding Planner' is based on a premise so reeking of incredibility, coincidence and contrivance that any attempt to connect it to the real world vanishes at the outset (and before you accuse me of being an unromantic and of not understanding that suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient in any film in the romantic comedy genre, I will just point to the brilliant 1967 film `Two For the Road' as evidence that this does not have to be the case).  Jennifer Lopez plays Mary Fiore, a hotshot wedding planner so absorbed in the minutiae of her work that she just can't seem to find the time or the inclination to look for Mr. Right herself.  One day she is `rescued' from near-death &#150; in a scene of stultifying stupidity &#150; by a handsome pediatrics doctor named Steve, played by Matthew McConaughey.  A feeling of mutual attraction develops between them, which leads to heady complications when, to Mary's utter amazement (but to no one else's in the audience), Dr. Steve turns out to be the fianc√©e of the very woman whose wedding Mary has been planning.  As always, the well-intentioned characters struggle with the complexities of the situation, momentarily consider the feelings of their future spouses, then immediately run off and do what's best for themselves anyway.  And why is it that, in situations such as this one, those rejected suitors always turn out to be either so self-absorbed and hateful that we don't care a bit if they're hurt by the wedding day turnabout, or so completely self-negating and understanding that they end up happily wishing the newly formed couple bon voyage with the rest of their friends and family?  Either way the audience is let off the hook and we are free to root for our two main characters with a clear conscience.  Some genres just have hopeless conventions I guess.One could conceivably overlook the mountain of clich√©s under which the story lies buried had the film at least managed to bring even a touch of freshness, style and wit to its execution.  Instead, we are subjected to an assortment of silly, lowbrow antics such as Mary finding herself on an out-of-control horse so that Steve can ride along and rescue her, or Steve breaking off the genitals of a statue and having to hold the newly glued piece on while talking to a policeman.  The dialogue doesn't help to raise the sophistication level of the film much either.Where `The Wedding Planner' really falls down, however, is in the performance department.  Jennifer Lopez appears to be a reasonably likable and attractive young woman, but she seems hopelessly puerile and amateurish both in her line readings and in her body language.  McConaughey is his usual blank self, and virtually every supporting player is forced to indulge in the broadest sort of comic overacting in a desperate attempt to wring at least SOME laughs out of this tired material.  The way I look at it is this  if you have seen `Runaway Bride' &#150; yet another bad romantic comedy &#150; you've already seen `The Wedding Planner.'  So skip it and rent `Two For the Road' and see what great romantic comedy is really all about!

In this film she plays an unlucky at love, searching for Mr. Right, still living at home girl. To her credit this role is as about as far away as you can get from the real J-Lo. She attempts to hide her ample charms beneath a business suit and a pulled back professional hair style. Doesn't work. Lopez, in a role more suited for Sandra Bullock, plays a wedding planner for the rich and affluent and who has no prospects of her own. Along comes Doctor Matthew McConnaghy with his dimples and perfect teeth who just happens by and saves our Jennifer and her shoe from a rampaging dumpster. Naturally they fall madly in love, or so it seems. Turns out old Dr. Matt is engaged to a high society miss (Bridgitte Wilson) who just happens to be Lopez' latest client. Well you know the rest. That's how predicable the story is. Lopez simply is not believable  as a plain Jane loser at love. McConnaghy's role would have come off better had his character been the cad that Lopez originally thought him to be. Instead we get a one-dimensional Hollywood pretty boy stereo type of performance. Among the supporting characters, Judy Grier as Lopez' assistant is good but is not given enough to do. Alex Rocco stands out as Lopez' father who tries to fix his daughter up with a husband (Justin Chambers). Fred Willard is wasted in an all too brief appearance as Basil St. Mosely the dance instructor. You know what the ending will be as soon as the main characters meet. It is a little unbelievable how easy Wilson accepts being left at the altar by McConnaghy and you have to feel sorry for the Chambers character when he too is unceremoniously dumped by Lopez.

You say yourself that probably they couldn't serve you the same soup as did several times ago. Another good reason can be J.Lo, which is a quite good actress, it's true.To stay at home with your girl or your family it's probably a good choice (well, not for you, but for her), but there's a limit this film has overcome. Not a more predictable, nonsense story could have been invented. People in love at first sight, weddings crashing on the altar and runaways of brides. The script is stuffed with some comic gags (a bit vulgar, like the scene of the statue), and the eccentricities of Massimo and his family. At least they spared us the typical gay friend ! Too little to save the weak plot, clear pretext to give J.Lo a role and make a rich box-office.The direction is decent (the budget was quite considerable!), as for the soundtrack and the two good starring actors. Surely, a classic in the genre, a must see for women on the point of wedding. Otherwise, it's a romantic, ordinary comedy for lovers only.

When she lands a major wedding for the firm things look good despite her father trying to marry her off to an Italian boy she used to know as a child.  However when she is saved from injury by an attractive doctor she falls in love only to find out that he is the groom in the wedding contract she has just landed.  Will true love find it's course or should she settle for a relationship that she needs to work at to find love.I'll admit that it was with a heavy heart that I decided to give this film a try, but I'd like to think I had a reasonably open mind to allow me to enjoy it.  Despite this I did find the whole experience to be pretty bland and lacking anything that made it either screamingly awful or really enjoyable.  The plot lacks spark or fizz and relies on contrivances that are unlikely but equally foreseeable.  The jokes or funny scenes are marked with that horrid stuttering/comic music that average romantic comedies resort to in order to appear sweet or amusing.  None of them are really funny or even that amusing, the odd scene is quite sweet but it is not a feeling that the film ever manages to sustain for very long.The cast are average at best.  Lopez is an OK actress and she plays her character well &#150; very well when you consider that the image of her as a diva is far from the sweet girl she plays here.  She's nice to look at but she has no character and is just a by-the-numbers romantic comedy lead.  McConaughey is the same, all thumbs when it comes to the acting and just plays it very bland.  Support characters are mixed with some good performances but far too many mock-Italian accents kicking around.Overall this is an average product that only seems to be aiming to sell J-Lo as a product rather than it being a film in it's own right &#150; it is very star driven.  It is not awful but it is just very lame and chances are you'll be struggling to remember anything of note about it even as little as a day later. "},{"Title":"Seen the trailer?
