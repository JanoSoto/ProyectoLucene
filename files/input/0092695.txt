And I am not being sarcastic at all. This movie came out the year I was born and I've still not seen a better children's movie. And when I speak of good children's movies I don't mean things like Teletubbies which can mesmerize a two-year old; I mean movies that I can still watch today and adore. For example, I loved Finding Nemo, as well as Shrek (not Shrek 2) and a few others. But not since Toy Story have I really loved a kid's movie as much as BLT. Yes, I'm stealing the sandwich's abbreviation and giving it to the movie.The thing about BLT that amazes me the most is just how adult it is. I mean, sure, it's not very adult to have a toaster, a vacuum, a lamp, a blanket, and a radio (JON LOVITZ!!) going on an adventure to find their old Master, and it may even be considered a little childish to be caught up on your old things-- but forget about the overtones! What about that nightmare? I won't spoil anything but see this movie and remember that question WHAT ABOUT THAT NIGHTMARE?! It is...intense.Listen to the words of the songs (other than their little going on an adventure theme). The song all the cars sing is devastating; the broken appliances are creepy as hell and the modern ones are so mean! And that little fat guy! Oh man, you just have to see this movie for yourself. There is nothing quite as wonderful as the cuteness of Blanky, the hypocrisy of Toaster, the courage of Lampy, the pride of Kirby, and of course, the wit of the Radio, all rolled into one film-- plus songs, squirrels and frogs etc, a giant angry magnet, an awesome TV personality, and enough colors and fun to warrant a sugar high.See this movie if there is any love inside of you.

My young nieces are just starting to grow out of that stage, which is sort of sad to me. Because never again will their minds be able to dwell within and without the fantasy world. This film captures that sort of mindset wonderfully. Of *course* the appliances get up and walk around as soon as we turn our backs. That's why we can never find anything!Seems like a lot of people who have posted here have made one of two mistakes1) They have forgotten that children's minds have not yet been clobbered into creative submission like adults', or2) The adults didn't watch the movie before plunking their kids down in front of the TV and going back to regrouting the tub.While this is a fantasy about appliances, it is also a film about loyalty, companionship, and even fear. There are several disturbing scenes but I think many kids will find it intriguing more than scary. And if they do find it frightening, then it's a good way to discuss the things that scare them.This film is mostly for kids, but I think it has plenty of stuff to keep the adults awake, especially Rabbit Ears, the black & white TV guy (look closely at some of the pictures he pulls out of the file cabinet). This film is infinitely better than other Disney films like The Little Mermaid and that sort of claptrap.

BLT has a strong subtext of time passing and becoming obsolete by the new generation. Then being abandoned and forgotten about. This movie is full of hidden meanings which I did not realize when I was young.The first thing I noticed when I watched BLT was how simple the animation looked. You get kinda desensitized after watching the graphics on Toy Story & Finding Nemo that it takes a little getting used to the animation in BLT. Some scenes look now better than a flash movie you'd play on Quicktime. The animation is like a mixture of The Lion King and The Simpsons.

First of all, you have to give it credit for its premise alone.  Take a standard road trip buddy picture and cast it with talking household appliances.  Acid induced?  Maybe.  But they take this ridiculous premise and roll with it, turning it into something that is honestly funny, sometimes sweet and strangely enough, kind of thought provoking in it's own way.  The dialog is almost Toy Story sharp at times, referencing everything from Joan Rivers to Teddy Roosevelt, and just like it's computer animated descendant, throws around some heavy ideas.  We watch as cars reminisce about their glory days before being crushed into cubes, look on in horror as appliances are gutted barbarically at a used parts store and root our quaint heroes on as they are confronted with the techno marvels of the modern age.  The characters just struggle to get home but the movie is about the struggle to stay relevant when you're constantly being replaced by a faster model.  An interesting idea when you think about it, and a fun, cool little movie worth seeing no matter what your age.

Although the same concept had been done before (ie, Lassie Come Home, The Wizard of Oz and similar stories), it had not been done with appliances, and The Brave Little Toaster excels at telling a story, introducing lovable (and odd) characters, and teaching about friendship. It is a strong film with an emotional message - although a little frightening. This film has plenty going for it, no matter if you're looking for comedy, action, responsibility, and moral lessons. It's an all-around enjoyable film.The basic storyline of The Brave Little Toaster follows five different appliances on a trek across the country (and city) to find their 'master' in the city. Along the way, they meet unusual characters and have to get out of a lot of scrapes, but they all help each other and come closer together - for which they all need to get to their final destination. None of them can manage to do this all on their own, and each of them have to learn to 'grow up' and become more responsible (and get along) in order to accomplish their goal. They each of different 'talents' and flaws.The toaster is probably the most mature of the bunch, and he/she is the natural leader of the group, though he/she suffers from what people may think or what may happen. However, at the end, the toaster makes the largest sacrifice to sacrifice himself/herself to save the life of the master. The blanket is the more immature or childlike of the bunch, and it is his photo of the master that helps them to get saved. The radio is the motor-mouth and comical element (along with the lamp), and he is able to pick up radio signals to find their way to the city. The lamp is a little bit dim and gives in to peer pressure and hasty arguments (mainly with the radio), but it is his light and bravery that leads his fellow appliances to their final destination. The vaccuum is the grumpiest of the bunch, and he learns how to be more appreciative while using himself as the vehicle to transport the others.This film teaches children an important concept - to look at the situation from another point of view. When the lamp and toaster are talking at night about the master and how it feels to be around the master, the toaster compares the feeling to a warm loaf of bread. The lamp does not understand this because a loaf of bread is meaningless to him, so the toaster compares the feeling to a warm glow, and the lamp knows exactly what the toaster means. Dialogue like this is done extremely well and directly aimed at children, though done without talking down at them.In conclusion, The Brave Little Toaster is a heart-warming story with a lot of lessons, comedy, music, and adventure that children will appreciate and have already appreciated. Although it is a classic story rewritten throughout history, it's like a warm loaf of bread.The Brave Little Toaster is a must-watch, but don't bother with The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars. The latter was a disappointment and has nothing to offer that the original has. This time, the characters have to go to Mars to save the master's baby. There are too many characters, and some of the original and lovable characters from the original are over-looked, and there doesn't seem to be a coherent plot or lesson learned. It's a dull watch, and I personally don't know why they bothered. (Do note that I only saw this film sometime in my late teens or early twenties. I have seen the original in the past year, and it's still an adorable film.) However, see The Brave Little Toaster. Now.

Along the way, the five appliances encounter various adventures and trials, like a waterfall, a pond with frogs, and a fat little repairman.In the transference of human emotion to everyday objects, the story's theme is the yearning to be included, to be relevant, to be needed and loved. The five adventurers display varying human traits. Radio is the most verbal, and something of a comic. Blanket is a tad snugly and sentimental. Kirby the vacuum cleaner is proud and brave. Lamp is light-hearted and upbeat. Toaster seems the most ... grounded with common sense.The film makes these low-tech appliances sympathetic and heroic. But contrast, the cutting-edge electronics are portrayed as mean and possibly deceptive. I wouldn't disagree with that.Color visuals are fine. Animation is acceptable. Even though the lyrics to some of the songs are hard to understand, I like the soundtrack, especially Trutti-Frutti, B-Movie Show, and Mammy. I don't quite understand the rationale for including multiple references to Roosevelt. And radio is forever referring to past historical events. I'm not sure why.Entirely appropriate for kids, The Brave Little Toaster works for adults too, mostly through its all-too-human emotional themes, and as a pleasant change from real-life actors, their dramas, and their careers.

So when I had the opportunity to re-watch it, I sprang to the chance. And not surprisingly it's still a fantastic movie.The story of Toaster, Kirby (Vaccum), Lamp, Radio, Blanket and their journey to find their Master. Their Master was a little boy who used and cared for them.

Only their friendship, and the willingness to find their master is their only hope of making and surviving the arduous journey.As I watched it, it was remarkable that I remembered almost every single scene as it played out. With social commentary (which I had no clue about back then), emotional scenes (the flower and it's reflection) and even scary as heck clowns (probably a big reason IT scared the heck outta me as well), the flick delivers an unbelievable amount of entertainment. And I haven't even talked about Phil Hartman, the songs, John Lovitz and the amazing humor.Back when I was watching Secret of the NIMH, Transformers, He-Man, The Care Bears, Fraggle Rock etc. only a few do I always consistently mention as being timeless classics and without a doubt, The Brave Little Toaster is one of the best and one of my favorite children animations flicks of all time.

I finally saw BLT for the first time today.  I'm twenty years old, and I enjoyed every second of it.  Although it has a concept that sounds like it would only appeal to children (5 old appliances trek from the long abandoned summer home where they live to find their owner's new home), the film has more than enough to entertain adults too.The characters are very rich, and all develop in fairly deep ways that young kids probably wouldn't even notice.  Their dialog is also incredibly funny, especially John Lovitz's as the witty radio, as they trade barbs and insults.  Most gripping though is the movie's dark tone, set by the acerbic characters' tenuous friendships and dangerous struggles.  If they were people, instead of appliances, this would probably be a horror movie. But thankfully they are appliances, gives the movie a fun angle by setting it in the secret life of electronic devices.  This is especially creative in Toaster's creepy nightmare about forks and bathtubs.There's music too, but it's not an important part of BLT.  The songs and dance sequences are forgettable compared to 90s Disney films, but they do entertain and set some great mood.BLT really isn't a kids cartoon.  I can imagine that it's colorful and musical enough that children could enjoy it, but they probably won't appreciate a lot of its humor and mood (and very young kids might even be scared by it).  So suck it up and go walk into the kids section at your nearest rental place and make sure you see this movie.

Disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Bambi, Pinocchio, Fantasia and the Great Mouse Detective and shows like Darkwing Duck, DuckTales, The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and Talespin shaped my childhood and I still adore them now. The Brave Little Toaster was another childhood favourite, and while it has some rather dark moments, it is a wonderful film and I think underrated too, as very few people I know have either seen it or remember it. The animation is lovely with warm colours and nice backgrounds, and all the characters are well animated. The songs are not bad at all, not as memorable as other Disney efforts perhaps, but pleasant to listen to, compared to other animated films(such as the Secret of NIMH 2) where the songs are either forgettable or make you want to stick your fingers down your throat. The characters are likable and well voiced by the likes of Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartmann, I love the the title character's determination and loyalty towards his friends, and the story is timeless. But the best asset is the script, with sharp humour and heart-warming sentiment, it was this alone that makes The Brave Little Toaster worth watching.

I caught it one early morning, straight after a night of serious zonked-out clubbing - probably in the right frame of mind for it, you could say - and ten minutes into it I was hooked. Funny, witty, crisp and unusually dark for a cartoon kiddies story, it does work throughout, bar a couple of plodding moments. But the points the film makes and the motives it revolves around, although not new or original, are well placed and executed - companionship, callousness, bonding, slip shoddiness, arrogance, transience and loyalty are all treated in a way which justifies even the occasional lapses into exaggerated sentimentality.What's even more interesting is to see how the film works in the setting of it's own initial premise - that is, an older apparatus, with cruder animation, compared to the marvels of CG graphics which nowadays we take as set standards. And even there it's an overall winner, it shows that one doesn't need a high flying budget, the latest technology or big name voice characterisations to make a point and come up with a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming cartoon flick.Whether this will become a true children's animated classic is yet to be seen, but it's on the right path, and it's ageing really well. Recommended for pre-teens and their parents everywhere, plus just about anyone who gives it a chance. True, there are a few moments of horror which very young children might find upsetting (I myself never really got over my first viewing of Bambi all those years ago -even my mum was in tears) - but that's the deal.Watch it, highly recommended.

The Brave Little Toaster is a gem of creativity from a team of Disney animators independently of their corporate masters which never got the release it so richly deserves. Thanks to its smart writing, near-perfect direction, a glowing voice cast, and not half-bad animation, Toaster is cooked to the right shade of entertainment. In an isolated summer cabin, five anthropomorphic household appliances (a toaster, a vacuum, a desk lamp, a radio, and an electric blanket) wait forlornly in anticipation for the return of The Master, a little boy whom they formed a bond with before his 2,000 day disappearance with his family. Fed up with waiting, Toaster (outstandingly voiced by Deanna Oliver) decides its time for them to set out toward the City of Light to find him. Their journey includes the stuff of adventure including appliance mutilation at a parts shop, a waterfall, evil modern appliances, and a sadistic junkyard magnet. Along the way, they learn to deal with their differences and band together to get home.This film, based from the novella by Thomas M. Disch, was originally a vehicle for a young animator's directorial debut. That animator was John Lasseter, who sought to combine 2-D characters on a computer background in-house at Disney. Unfortunately, Disney's films were in the malaise era, therefore it's penny-pinching management pulled the plug on the project and fired Lasseter from his job. The project was then taken to independent studio Hyperion, where it ended up in the hands of Lasseter's good friends, animators Jerry Rees (Tron) and Joe Ranft (later Pixar writer) who transformed the novella into a smart screenplay that, unlike Disney, wasn't afraid to take risks with its imagery or ideas. Despite a budget that is practically an eighth of what it takes to produce decent animation, the heart and creativity gives it that special edge.What sets this film apart from other animated films during that time, and even some features nowadays is the way Rees and Ranft got a handle on their characters. Just like the finest work at Pixar (where Lasseter and Ranft expanded on these achievements even more) each character has a special personality, and has the voice cast to match. The cast includes great voice actors and some great comedians, like SNL alums Jon Lovitz (as the loud and bombastic Radio) and Phil Hartman (who hilariously impersonates both Jack Nicholson and Peter Lorre in great cameos), Disney/Tony the Tiger voice actor Thurl Ravenscroft as the rumbling vacuum Kirby, Groundlings Deanna Oliver and Tim Stack as Toaster and Lampy, respectively, and Timothy E. Day as the sweetly innocent Blanky.What makes Toaster very unique is its unabashed ventures into nightmarish imagery and scary sequences. There are plenty to go around in this movie, which some have seen as totally unnecessary and cruel. However, they're no scarier than the original Disney features, which themselves dabbled in darker images to offset the whimsy and sweetness. These scenes also add to the emotions of the journey that anything may face. I must say the darkest, but also the best, has to be the Junkyard sequence which is accompanied by the Van Dyke PArks song Worthless, which evokes more emotion in five minutes than many features can't achieve in two hours. This movie has all the right elements that work to a very good degree. David Newman and Van Dyke Parks' score and songs are pretty impressive, and dare I say brilliant. Jerry Rees' direction is pitch-perfect, the writing is good, the characters are good, its good to look at. This is a good, and very underrated movie. Give it a watch, and you will not be disappointed.

Disch imaging of when he created this story? I mean, this can be asked of for any novelist but I guess the fact that the idea seems so out in left field, just makes it so much more significant to ask. Did Mr. Disch have a connection between himself and the appliances he had at his house? It is definitely a creative idea but what inspired him to come up with it? In some ways it presents itself as a premature movie that inspired Toy Story (1995) (considering John Lasseter was on the animation team originally), and in other ways in dives into territories some viewers may not expect. The story follows the travels of five appliance items who long to hear from their master, or the kid who consistently used them from their childhood. Come to find out, their master has moved on permanently. Refusing to be left alone or to be taken over by another person, the group of appliances set out to find their owner. To do this, they test the fates by stepping outside the house and venture out to accomplish their mission. Along their journey they will also learn some very startling truths that the real world has in store (no pun intended).The screenplay written by Jerry Rees and now deceased Disney veteran Joe Ranft is praiseworthy for its creativeness and heartfelt characters. The voice casts behind the characters are great. Jon Lovitz as the radio is probably the most comical of the bunch for his quick remarks and energetic attitude. That's not to say the others aren't memorable either. Deanna Oliver as the toaster is by far the most memorable for her soft voice and caring heart. Every viewer will find his or her own character to latch onto. However, with good characters come some flaws that need to be addressed in the story. One of them is continuity - if the group needs an outlet so they can move; the story cannot all of a sudden drop the need for one.The other flaw that needs to be addressed is the element of death. A family picture has every right to portray a death in a story. The world is not always happy-go-lucky and that's something people learn to understand as they grow up. So the idea that this exists in the movie isn't the flaw - the flaw is how some scenes portray the death. A dramatic death is the best type to be used in a kid's film. But ones that involve torture or mutilation? That may be diving a little too deep for young viewers. Of course it's OK because guts and blood are replaced with nuts, bolts and battery acid, but that's just as graphic as portraying it to a kid as is blood and guts to an adult. I mean props for taking on adult material but why is it handled with such care as if it were for a horror film? Take it easy guys.Other than that the rest of the film provides solid entertainment. Along with likable characters, are unique songs (although they may not stick), colorful animation and appropriate film music. David Newman, who produced the score didn't create a theme for these characters but it does match the scenes effectively and do convey the correct emotion. If a family film is what you're looking for, this is definitely one that can be on your list. Hopefully for young one's now a days it shouldn't be too scary.Its story does suffer from minor continuity errors and portrays death fairly harsh for young viewers, but that doesn't stop the characters from being any memorable than they already are today. It may seem kiddy when in fact it is more adult like than some may know.

It's a great kid's film, but there are plenty of hidden themes for adults if you look closely enough at it. Out of all the Disney movies, I think it's one of the more obscure ones compared to the overly popular ones you always see on lunch boxes, T-shirts, and what not. That's the beauty of it. Any fan of film can easily tell the same writers here would go on to work on the Toy Story series, especially when in comparison with the recent Toy Story 3. The due credit starts right there, but it only continues on with an awesome voice cast. My favorites would definitely be Thurl Ravenscroft as Kirby and Jon Lovitz as The Radio. Each character is pretty distinct, and the story allows each their moment to be a hero.The artwork style has a nice aged look to it, and can be quite menacing at times. In fact, I'd say more often than not the atmosphere and lighting is quite dark. This goes right along with the aforementioned themes, which are prevalent throughout the film; themes of solitude, the need for companionship, which coincide with truly bizarre, cold and heart-breaking scenes. One of the few moments in film history to ever actually draw tears from me is the flower scene. It was strikingly depressing, making one almost subconsciously ask themselves if life without intimacy is worth living at all. Another theme I noticed, and appreciated just as much as if not more, is the very important message of not forsaking the antiquity of life. All of this helped along by a score that is dark, adventurous and mysterious all at once. Done by David Newman , it always heightens the mood of the film. Plus the songs by Van Dyke Parks are really well done and quite catchy. My favorite would definitely be Worthless. I must definitely recommend Brave little Toaster to anyone who wants to experience a truly unique animated film, to me a classic and one of the best of all time.

The entire movie from beginning to end is one of those classic Disney adventures start to stop, and it truly holds true to that time late 80's animation where they weren't afraid to spook kids out a bit, or make people feel sad in a movie, or just draw really imaginative, fluid things. I do compare it to Toy Story, although it reminds me more of Homeward Bound.The one cool thing, is like Toy Story, is that I would say this movie dives into 'scary' more than most children's films, also like The Rescuers and Once Upon A Forest. No doubt this movie is also a very bright, classic story, but this movie really twists and turns all over the place in such a great way. Even at 20 years old, I still personally love the really random Alice In Wonderland feel to it, the characters really and truly go through so many different feelings, settings, and movie genres that I think it's a great movie that truly introduces kids to many types of films; drama, adventure, family, spooky, etc etc. In a way, it's a movie that I think the boys enjoy a little more than the girls, and since every cartoon aimed at boys today has to do with robots or digimon, I have to say that The Brave Little Toaster was indeed more imaginative and fun to grow up on than asain anime garbage.

I saw a good bunch animated Disney flicks as a kid, from different eras, and I would say The Brave Little Toaster is by far the least Disney-like of them all! However, I guess it isn't really a Disney flick. It was released by Walt Disney Pictures, but was produced by Hyperion Pictures. Obviously, that explains a lot. Anyway, sometime within the past four years or so, I watched it for the first time probably since the 90's, and finally, once again last night. Like a number of films that were actually produced by Disney, this Hyperion Pictures production is a decent family adventure that has held up well for me in recent years.In a rural cottage, a group of living, anthropomorphic appliances reside Toaster, an electric blanket named Blanky, a lamp named Lampy, Radio, and a vacuum cleaner named Kirby. They used to see their master, a young boy named Rob, every summer when he came to the cottage with his family on vacation, but they haven't seen him in a while. They wonder if he will ever come back to this house in the woods, or if they've been abandoned. When they see a for sale sign put up in front of the house, the Toaster decides to lead the rest of the appliances on a journey to find their master. After getting the reluctant Kirby to agree to come along, and a bit of a struggle to find means of transportation, the five of them set off on a trek through the country to the city where Rob lives. Their journey does not turn out to be easy, however, as they experience conflict and life-threatening situations on the way! After watching this cartoon again after a long time, there are certain negative aspects I can point out. Some of the voice acting is a little weak, sometimes with Deanna Oliver as Toaster, with lines such as, It's the blanket, and especially the voice for Blanky (though I'm sure Timothy E. Day, whoever he was/is and whatever happened to him, was just a little kid at the time, so I guess I shouldn't complain too much). I also didn't care much for the part where the cottage air conditioner loses his temper and blows up. However, there's definitely a lot I still like. Most of the voice acting is good, including the voice-overs from two Saturday Night Live stars, Jon Lovitz as Radio and the late Phil Hartman as Air Conditioner (an imitation of Jack Nicholson) and the Hanging Lamp in the shop (based on Peter Lorre). There are definitely funny parts as well, often involving the conflict between Lampy and Radio. The part with appliance shop owner Elmo St. Peters can also be funny (it's sad to know that Joe Ranft, the multi-talented man who provided this character's voice, died in a car accident in 2005), and so can some of the characters that appear later in the film. There's some really good animation here as well, plus some good songs, such as City of Light and Worthless, and the characters get into some very interesting situations on their journey.There are lots of popular animated films featuring anthropomorphic animals, but anthropomorphic appliances? This is definitely something unusual and bizarre! I haven't read Thomas M. Disch's book of the same name, which this movie is based on (I never even knew it was based on a book until just before my most recent viewing), but I'm sure it's very similar. The Brave Little Toaster is probably not quite what you would usually expect from an animated family adventure movie. It has a rather strange, eerie feel to it, which I found when I was a kid and still find now, even though it has never really scared me. Mind you, there are parts that could scare little kids, such as Toaster's nightmare with the evil clown. I feel I should warn parents about that. Nonetheless, despite its moments of horror, this movie clearly has entertained many kids over the years, and can probably appeal to many adults as well, even if the idea of anthropomorphic appliances sounds childish.

Along the way, they meet other appliance and things in the woods and also get wet. If you're a child watching this, you probably wouldn't question the water.

There's a vacuum, Kirby.A radio, a lamp, an electric blanket, and a toaster. They've been up there for sometime. Their master is a young kid, he moved to the city with his parents some time ago. Ever since, the appliances kept busy by bickering with one another. Radio and Lampy are always at eachother's plugs, Kirby eats the dirt off the floor, and Toaster awaits the day when he can cook toast again. The only other appliance in the house is an air conditioner, voice of Phil Hartman. He tells the otherstheir master isn't coming back, then throws a fit and blows a fuse.           Then they learn the cottage will be sold. So to avoid getting new masters, they must go and find their old one. That's no easy task.So they strap a big battery to an office chair and have Kirby pull it. Lampy tried a bunch of bogus suggestions first, like them traveling on a pogo stick, a mattress on wheels, and in the refrigerator.          They camp out in the woods, next morning they make friends with some forest animals, then weather a stormy night where Blanky blows away and Lampy acts as a lightning rod to recharge the battery. Kirby rescues Blanky but states he just did it because they were wasting time. Kirby may be a grump on the outside, but he must have a heart inside, because when his friends fall down a waterfall, he goes in after them. They're found by a collector. He actually butchers appliances for parts. Radio's tubes are about to go on display, but his friends have a plan, using Toaster's reflection.            They escape and make it into the city. Their master had grown up since they were away at the cottage. He was going away to college and his mom wans to make sure he has plenty of socks. Now as bad luck would have it, Master (Rob) and his girlfriend were heading to the cabin to pick up the appliances! But they're not there! They're in Rob's apartment and meet modern gadgets who toss them into the garbage.       At the junk yard, they avoid a mean crane/magnet and a machine that smashes things into cubes. At one point, Rob is trapped on the machine, about to be smashed, but it's Toaster to the rescue. That's sort of why he's called the Brave Little Toaster. Well, it's a happy ending and the appliances are going off to college.       I've liked this movie since I was a little kid. The part where Rob is stuck on the Smasher and is about to be squashed used to scare me. It was followed by two shallow sequels! But do stick to the original.

I hadn't seen the movie in a long time, and I was wondering if it still held up to me even nowadays. The answer? An enormous yes all the way to Jupiter. The story is actually not bad, with a bunch of home appliances embarking on a journey to find their master. The characters?

The songs are still just as good as they were back then as they are now. And the Disney animation really hits a bullseye as well.

"},{"Title":"A toast to The Brave Little Toaster! While, the movie is indeed creepy. It's a guilty pleasure of mine. I kinda Lovitz!","Date":"15 February 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" This movie directed by Jerry Rees probably traumatized a lot 1980's & 1990's kids. For me, the eerie story produced by Hyperion Pictures, distributed by Disney, and based on the 1980's children's novel by Thomas M. Disch The Brave Little Toaster A Fairy-Tale For Appliances was a fun watch. It tells the story about five household appliances Toaster (Voiced by Deanna Oliver), Radio (Voiced by Jon Lovitz), Blanket (Voiced by Timothy E. Day), Lamp (Voice by Tim Stack) and Kirby the Vacuum (Voiced by Thurl Ravenscroft) on a dangerous long quest to find their owner, referred to as the Master. Disney had bought the movie rights to the novel before it was even able to get published! I noticed about the novella, was that it was generally much lighter in tone than the film. The film really is very unsettling for a kid's movie. As much, as I like it, I don't believe, really younger audience members should see it. There are disturbing things that cannot be unseen, like the firefighter clown or the poor blender getting his motor, rip out, like a person getting his organs harvest in the black market. The worst had to be, the withering death of a love-sick flower or car death camp scene. Those scenes still make me sad. The movie really tries hard to contributing a feel-good nature to the already depressing premise. Sadly, it doesn't match up that well. A good example of this is the meadow segment, with a burlesque comedy of beavers, turtles and squirrels, culminating in a grand 1930s style musical water ballet of frogs and an operatic fish. It felt out of place. For a film that has a really dumb premise, it's surprising very smarten delivered. There are tons of fan theories about this movie. You really can go into the movie hidden themes, like how the movie acts like a social commentary and critic to 1980s over-consumerism and throwaway society. The appliances could represented, the older generations like the Baby Boomers & the Greatest & Silence generation trying to find a reason to live in a Generation X, type world, where they don't matter as much. Older people can relate to those appliances, because they saw themselves, being replace in the job field, family life and others. A good example of this, is the scene with the pickup car that formerly belonged to a Hopi reservation. His driver told him to his face that he was worthless and junked him, despite his being in near perfect condition. It could represent how even the Native American became a bit too materialism in the world. Another theory is that movie is secretly really about the Holocaust and how they 'the masters' AKA Nazis dealt with the mentally challenge. People say that the appliances represent mentally ill people that had been abandoned, because people see no use with them. The toaster has extreme Claustrophobia. Lamp has aggression issues. Vacuum has OCD. Blanket has stalking issues/extreme co dependence and Radio is bi polar. I can see, where people might get this idea. After all, characters like the Radio talks as if he's living in the 1940s and the car junkyard could represented the Nazis death camps. Other people think it's about Uncle Toms slave during the days of American slavery. Once again, I can see why people think that way. The biggest fan theory that I heard is that the movie represented how God sees suicide. Just think about it five appliances wait patiently for their Master to return AKA God/Jesus. They are almost tricked into thinking that he has abandoned them, but they overcome this and set off to find him and the City of Light AKA Heaven, only to believe, they been replace. Their many adventures are metaphorical for the trials and tribulations of life, when they gave up on him, they went sent to the junkyard, representing hell and Satan. Then, we meet sad stories of car, telling stories about their owners giving up on them or themselves like the Texan, the Indy 500 car, and the woody wagon. It's really heavy to take. This movie is 2010's Toy Story 3 if it went to the extreme. It's a lot more mature than a lot of kid's film, even today. A lot of dark imagery, but at least, the movie ends with a happy note. The animation seems a bit dated and grainy, but it somehow acts to reinforce the notion that the appliances are out of pace with their city competitors. It's not the best. The voice acting are pretty good for the most part. The movie has a lot of great music. It's A B-Movie Show, City of Light., 'Worthless' and 'Tutti Frutti' are fun to listen to. The comedy is at a minimum, but somewhat funny. Most of the humor comes from the smartly written dialogue for the Radio. Mostly a hit, with a few misses. It should be noted that some of the people behind this film such as John Lasseter and Joe Ranft went on to work for Pixar. In fact, Lamp may be based on the same lamp used for the design of Pixar's first CGI short - which became the studio's logo. The original film was followed by two sequels. The first sequel was 1997's The Brave Little Toaster & 1998'sThe Brave Little Toaster Goes To Mars. Those sequels are not worth checking out. Can't recommended that. Overall You can never be too old for this classic, but you could be too young for this film. Not a little kid's movie. More like a PG-13 film in today standards. So, grab a plateful of buttered toast, and your cozy electric blanket for this good, but gloomy film! It's worth watching.

After the air conditioner commits suicide because the other appliances make fun of him for not missing Master, they reluctantly leave the safety of the cottage to find Master, in a journey filled with unexpected danger where new commercial items like CD players and Laserdisk players (new at the time), are quickly replacing older items in the big city. Unknown to the group of outdated appliances, Master has gone to college and comes back to get his items from the cottage, and upon finding that they're missing he searches for them, leading up to a suspenseful rescue at a garbage dump that reunites everyone.I personally loved this movie, especially how it shows that new isn't always better (I think texting is also a great example, ugh). I also love how the animators brought the appliances to life, personifying them as sentient beings (my favorite was the radio). However, in doing so, several very disturbing situations are created within the film.The situation famous as being extremely creepy is when the toaster has a nightmare involving an evil clown with a fire hose (water wrecks electrical appliances). Clowns are creepy enough on their own but put them in a kid's movie, while the clown tries to murder the toaster, and that's a freaky scene. Another freaky scene is the radio's 'organ harvesting', where the radio is squeezed in a vice and has its inside components removed while it calls for help. The air conditioner's suicide, the lamp getting struck by lightning, the car crusher in the garbage dump, the Vincent Price hanging lamp and the vacuum nearly drowning are all very disturbing scenes, and to a child they could be very frightening. I should know, I was six when I first got this movie and it freaked me out for three years or so.That being said, the soundtrack, especially the songs B-Movie Cutting Edge and Worthless are both amazing, as are the voice actors. The plot is very original, based on a children's novel that differs greatly but still keeps the essential plot points. Overall, it's a pretty great movie, if you get the chance, check it out.

This is one of the first and probably one of the few or only animated movie I've seen that was very complex and had a lot of depth to it.

The flower mistakes Toaster's reflection for another flower and falls in love with it. After Toaster tells the flower that its only a reflection, the flower dies before Toaster's eyes.All of these scenes (Especially the flower scene) are made even more touching and moving thanks to the beautiful music by David Newman.

I even recall staying home from school some days back when the days seemed so long to my small mind and watching this movie. I think I'll one day buy this movie on DVD for my children to see.

Instantly, my mind rushed with many vivid, powerful memories that, I truly think, have had an impact on my childhood years. My childhood imagination was profoundly driven by watching this movie. Last night, I really thought about my youth. Reminiscing those years, it brought a tear to my eye; BLT's beautifully crafted nature stays ingrained in your mind. When you think about the movie, it's easy to stop what you're doing and just think on those years of innocence, starting off fresh, and not knowing what you have until you lose it. For the first time in a long time, thinking about BLT last night has really unfolded everything that was conveyed, sort of as if it were saying, Now do you understand what all this means?When I was only 3, I remember going down to visit my grandparents and I would refer to myself as the Lamp and my dad as the Radio. When I was 4, my dad video taped me and my brother talking to Santa Claus about our Christmas lists and I clearly remember referring to myself, yet again, as the lamp. With my curious young mind, I grew a deep interest in ceiling fans that everyone in my family remembers. This mostly has to do with the scene in the dark room of the fat, greedy man's shop of old appliances where the fan spun into the air; their gadgets and plugs moving about. And the times I used to draw whatever was on my mind as a young kindergarten student, it would usually involve landfills with cars, ceiling fans, and even this idea of becoming the entrepreneur of an appliance shop. Now, I don't have these same interests anymore, but BLT is not a sterile cartoon; if it were enough to be remembered now, it surely has made a point. It does this using innovative plots; really, who would have come up with the idea of appliances running the show and personifying virtually every modern machine? Silly little details that are subliminally presented in the movie I remember to the core and it was reinforced by my interests. To the person who brought up the cheesy Tootie Fruity song, it took me just moments to remember everything that happened in the first scene. The radio wakes up blaring the song and the movie kicks off. Cute, cheesy, but it stays with you. The essence of memory is something so hard to explain, yet the mystery of how it works is what makes it so amazing.The more I think about each scene, the more incredibly vivid memories I have. From the dark repair shop of the fat business man, I now remember all the appliances floating in the air, shunning their worthlessness and inviting our heroes to join their fate, while the Toaster and Blanky cringing in a crib; Kirby sitting on the floor being confronted by an oven. The landfill with the decrepit cars singing until their last dreaded moments of existence as they become aluminum cubes (one by one); the magnet chasing the appliances around; it all comes back to me and I haven't seen the movies in several years. I can almost play the entire movie again in my head; I still remember what the characters sounded like.You really will never ever forget this movie even the first time you let it sink in. As a child, every message presented is subliminal; but the colors, cute plot, and details stay in your mind. All of this goes on, only to be unleashed in your more mature years when you reflect on your youth and realize the messages BLT explained about society, how we cope with abandonment/loneliness, working as a team, etc. Now do you understand what this all means? In a world shattered by apathy, cynicism, and waste, the sense of hope is manifested in the pursuit of the characters to find happiness again. Clearly, this is one childhood memory hidden in the unconscious mind that Sigmund Freud would likely refer to! I don't understand why, but no other movie I have ever watched in my life has had this same effect as the Brave Little Toaster had on me. Even though I am nearly 18, I almost want to go out and buy the DVD to just let it rejuvenate me, a return to innocence, and believing in your highest ambitions. It's more than a child's movie. True, you watch it as a child; but everything comes together when you're older. I overwhelmingly recommend this film to any parent. Take it from one of the first people who saw this movie (generation wise.)

Kids must be exposed to these sorts of things at a younger age, so they can understand them, trust me it's worse for a kid to find out about death from a classmate, than it is from a movie about toasters.  I am positive there is symbolism and social commentary in here somewhere, and I'm working on just what they're poking fun at... It's good to hear old Phil Hartman's voice. anyways, I grew up on this movie (as well as Ghostbusters), and I think it's definitely something that every toddler should own, it's also got some great songs in there that adults will know. All in all this is one of the best family films to watch with your kids because of it's mature themes and jokes, butit's childish appeal.

I have watched this movie so many times, I can pretty much recall every single scene into detail, every single one with it's own unique feel to it.The story is about the appliances craving to get reunited with their owner, after they see a man putting up a For sale sign in front of the cottage they are currently in. They go on a huge quest to find their master, along which they meet overly curious squirrels and evil, misleading, top-of-the-line appliances, travel through dark woods, and of course the all-too-well-known scrapheap.There are very dark scenes in this movie, yes. Even as a 19-year old, some bits still creep me out (clown scene, lightning strike on Lampy's bulb, etc). But it is wrong to not let your kid watch it because of that. And concerning the supposed strong language (i.e. idiot and stupid) it's not like they will never learn those words. Anyway,the scrapheap scene (and the Worthless song) is something that really stuck with me for my whole life ever since I saw it. It's fairly gruesome. The cars there all feel like there is no point to their existence anymore (being broken or outdated), and they have grown to accept this, waiting until they get picked up by a menacing-looking magnet, and then crushed in a huge clash between the crusher's jaw, and the rollers. Compacted into small metal cubes.It shows no emotion at all during any of this. It does not care less or more whether he is demolishing his fellow machines. This is a very good representation of in all reality, a serial killer. The magnet is his henchman, reeling in the defeated and outdated for the crusher to end.This all sounds very gloomy and disturbing, and that is because it is. But that is what makes this movie so special. It doesn't float around on a dreamy story (even though these are, like I said, appliances). It shows fear, companionship, abandonment, and the ongoing need for love and care.I will always keep this movie close to my heart, and it's story will go down in the grave with me. I can't help but like it for all it's characters, stories, and thoughts that get put into us. And of course, just the characters themselves make this movie worth watching it, and even though I only mentioned the scary stuff, this movie has a lot of very nice and happy scenes. Such as the frog ballet, trial-and-error with the transportation, and the likes. I will always be proud to have this as a part of my childhood, and I definitely plan on showing this to my kids if I ever have any.If you are worried about the scrapheap scene right now as a parent, you can look it up on www.youtube.com, under the name The Brave Little Toaster - Worthless (No Interruptions).Sincerely,- Victor Bischoff "}{"Title":"Not really a Disney movie, but a rough gem of a movie nonetheless","Date":"27 June 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Though animated more like a saturday morning cartoon than a feature and featuring rather bland character designs, The Brave Little Toaster is still better than a lot of other cartoons.  It has a visual creativity (part-Looney Tunes, part Silly Symphonies, and (a small)part MTV) that makes up for its limitations.  Plus, the story (about animate appliances going on a road trip to find their master) beats Toy Story to the punch by about seven years (though I suppose animate inanimate objects were just about the first things put into cartoons).  The songs are fun, if not performed perfectly, and fit better with the story than in a lot of recent Disney movies.  The scene where the appliances all clean the house to Little Richard's Tutti Frutti is a lot more entertaining than the whistle While You Work scene from Snow White.  The best thing about BLT, though, is Toaster himself, who is the most convincing of the characters as he transforms from a bit of a coward and a follower into a full-fledged hero in the end.  The scene he has with the flower is really beautiful.I was ten when this movie first came out, and I watched it whenever I could on the Disney channel.  It's still one of my favorite English-language cartoons from the eighties.

It is.This film has elements every children's movie should have, and in a unique and fun context. The humourous aspects of conflict between the appliances shows children that they can resolve differences no matter how different they are in reality. The musical interludes are not as corny and systematic as those in the mainstream Disney films, and are hilarious in themselves. The animation is smooth and captivating, and the storyline lacks nothing.If you're thinking you need a good children's film and you've seen all the popular ones, go get The Brave Little Toaster.

The other appliances include a hoover, Kirby; The Radio (Jon Lovitz); a blanket and Lampy. They go through quite a lot to find their master, e.g. some sort of park with animals, a dark forest and storm, a river and a scary repairs man, but they do eventually find him, or rather he finds them in a junk yard, after going to his house.

The Brave Little Toaster is probably not the best recommendation for viewers of any age. Once you've watched it for the first time and you are at a very mature stage, you will be ready for years of therapy! It's not all bad, though. The only weird part about it is just seeing appliances come to life and have personalities of their own. The story mainly focuses on six specific appliances left behind at a country house (who all happen to be guys; not one female). They decide to go on a journey to find their owners. One of them, an air conditioner, didn't go with them since he was attached to a wall. The team consisted of a bright (yet easily annoyed) lamp, a comical and annoying radio, a short-tempered vacuum cleaner who's oblivious to reality, a cuddly blanket (probably the best representation of a youngster), and their leader, a courageous toaster. The strong points and weak points of these characters are both equal in a lot of ways. Now for the things I liked about this movie. Now that I look back at it, a lot of great actors worked on this movie. Many could probably easily recognize the voices of Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman, and of course, Thurl Ravenscoft. I also enjoyed the songs on this movie. You gotta admit, the songs on this movie are really cool songs; well, this movie came out in the 80's, so one would very likely expect it to have songs with very high-tech styles. It kinda sucks that I'm not able to find those songs anywhere. Despite the cast and the songs, the movie is still overall weird; then again, the movie did come out in the 80's, and I guess a lot of people were drunk around that time. Yeah, that may have something to do with it. My suggestion, if you ever get an urge to watch this movie, watch it for the songs; those are really the best part of the movie. That's pretty much all I gotta say about it.

This movie implies that the toaster, a fairly common household appliance, has natural predators.  In my years as a wildlife biologist, I have had the opportunity to observe several taosters in nature and it is abundantly clear that it, as the loon, has no enemies in the wild.  This movie gives children a false, negative impression of forest dwelling animals which is completely unfair.  Children the world over will be led to lives of big game hunting and generally slandering the good names of these animals. As a rule of thumb, I never underestimate something which has the ability to turn bread into warm, crunchy, and often dark brown bread.

Despite being household appliances and perhaps not best suited for long outdoor journeys, a toaster, a lamp, a radio, a blanket and a vacuum cleaner all join to start their impossible quest with only loyalty, friendship and hope to guide their way.Although I'm not such a fan of film that I'll watch anything, I did quite fancy this animation because some of the names involved made me hope that while this entertained kids it would have enough for adults &#150; maybe not Toy Story style humour but at least something for me. The fact that it didn't really aim for the adult section of the audience is not a major problem because it is for kids after all. As such the story does OK and the characters are all bright and colourful in a simple story that doesn't really challenge the audience (kids or adults) very much. The film occasionally interested me but really it is fairly simple lesson stuff and I must admit that the ending would have been much better if the toaster's sacrifice had been the ultimate one rather than something easily fixed &#150; now that would have been impacting but then I suppose it is a children's film.The voice talent is recognisable and do pretty well considering the material isn't up to the sort of things they have been best in. Oliver's Toaster is cute visually and in regards the voice but there isn't a great deal of depth to it. Lovitz without funny material is a bit annoying and that is how he gets eventually here. Hartman is always welcome but he hasn't got the material either. Stack is OK, Day is uninteresting and a bit whiney and none of them really make much of an impression although they do meet the kids' movie requirements of being fairly noisy and relentlessly cheerful.Overall this is a kids' film and I doubt that adults will get much from it unless they have warm childhood memories and viewing it feeds them. It's all very noisy and colourful but the script is average, the animation nothing that special and the songs leave a lot to be desired.
