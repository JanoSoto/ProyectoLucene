[{"Title":"5,2??? Don't believe in this rating!!! This is the best family movie of the 90-s and the sweetest one","Date":"20 April 2004","Score":"81 out of 99 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family","Review":" First of all, I want to say some of my thoughts about IMDb ratings. If you look at IMDb top 250 you can hardly find any family movie . In fact, there are only three family movie (I mean live action movies not animated flicks) in this chart. They are Princess Bride on the 99 position (haven't seen yet), A Christmas Story on 142 (a movie nobody heard of besides English speaking countries) and the E.T. on the 244 (forever classic - no point denying that). And I bet you would be unable to find another one even in top 500. On the other hand you can find in this list, for example, more than eighty thrillers or more than thirty 30 war movies. Does that result means that family movies can't be good. Obviously it is not. For me the point is that many of people as well as lots of critics don't appreciate movies sweet movies without profanity, drugs, sex and violence. Cheesy movie for kids only that's not a fair grade. Well it's only my opinion but for me it's very sad when such a beautiful movie become so undeservedly underrated. Now, more directly to our movie. I watched Free Willy no less than four or five times and found it one of the best family and animal movie ever made. The bonds of friendship between man and animal are shown incredibility well here. From this point Free Willy remembered me another beautiful animal movie The Black Stallion. The unlikely friendship between twelve years old Jesse and giant whale as the main element of the story is very sweet and touching. Overall plot is well constructed (and there's no point to complain its unreality) with decent development of the main characters. Young and definitely talented Jason Jammes Richter created terrific performance of a young lonely problem boy Jesse. Also very good in the movie were August Schellenberg (as Randolph) and Michael Madsen (as Glen). As I always mentioned cinematography is pretty good, including first-rate animal action (Keiko is so cute there). The beautiful movie soundtrack written by Basil Poleuydouris a bit resembled for me terrific Carmine Coppola's score for The Black Stallion. And finally, that's maybe the most important Free Willy is a very humanistic movie, a movie that what was made with love and care about nature. Thanks to Simon Wincer for this great masterpiece. We need more movies like this, not a laughable rubbish that Hollywood studios now provide for family entertainment. I rated Free Willy 10 out of 10 as an excellent and beautiful family friendly movie. Check out also its two sequels. They are also pretty good.Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.

The story of Jason James Richter's character trying to escape from a life of crime and missing prospects is way beyond the average. The growing affection for Willy is not even stereotyped or clich√©d. It's a genuine bond that focuses on two outcast characters who slowly but surely come to experience true friendship and the value of trust. Jason's performance really appealed to me when I saw this movie as a kid. It is a sincere depiction of friendship, of a way out, of fighting for your values against all odds and of never giving up. Right, I'm grown up now, but this is one of the movies of my childhood I'd like to watch again, and I'm sure I'd enjoy it almost as much as back then. Jason James had very few acting appearances, but the Free Willy series assured him his place in movie history. His entire performance in here is sincere and straight, he doesn't laugh nor smile if it wasn't just natural in the specific sequences. His facial expressions and body language fit into the total frame as well. The story has some profoundly human themes to it. I can't help it, I think this one is both entertaining and deep, dealing with emotions and prospects of life, with integrity and courage in the face of danger.

But if you can appreciate films that have something important to say and something that it wants people to open their eyes to, then Free Willy is just as important and gripping as anything from Gandhi to Platoon, Mississippi Burning to Boyz and the Hood and JFK to Dancing With Wolves. And that is the truth.  The problem with films like this is that it is viewed in the same light as movies like Gorillas In The Mist and Instinct. And that is they are bleeding hearted fluff.  They ask you to feel for animals.  It asks you to realize that we are bad people and that we should change the system from within.  The only problem with that last statement is that it is said while people are rolling their eyes and using a sarcastic tone.  But if we can look at films like Schindler's List and Cry Freedom, films that examine the atrocities perpetrated towards humans, see them for the genius that they are, why can we not take a film that has something to say about the abominable treatment of animals more seriously.  After all, as Shylock once said, Does a Jew not bleed?  Does an animal?We are so desensitized towards cruelty to animals that we are practically oblivious to their plight.  When we hear of a stray dog that shows up at the humane society with internal bleeding and a missing eye, we say that it's terrible and then we turn away and forget about it until the next ones shows up.  When we go to water parks and see captive whales performing tricks we laugh and cheer and go back to our freedom and think nothing of the life that was destroyed when that beautiful beast was taken from its habitat. If anything, this movie shows us that we should not imprison these or any wild animals, and it does it so well that if you have any ounce of compassion in you, it will affect you.  This film is not just for 10 year olds, it is a film that should be viewed by everyone that takes their freedom for granted. Because if all of a sudden one day we were put in prison for no reason, then and only then would we truly understand what animals go through.Perhaps you think this review is not really about a movie and all I am doing is expressing my political beliefs, and that may be true, but if someone doesn't say something about this, then what good is our right of freedom of speech.The film itself is about a parentless boy that ends up in foster care. There he ends up working at a Sea World type place where he meets a newly captured whale.  He then takes it upon himself to free the whale knowing that the whale is going to be killed for insurance purposes.As I said though, I believe this is an important story and if you disagree, think about the film  A Time To Kill .  Matthew McConnauhey ( wrong spelling, I know ) gives his speech at the end about the heinous crimes that were committed against the little black girl.  He asks the all white jury to close their eyes as he tells the story.  At the end of his graphic description he tells them to imagine she was white.  It won him the case. Now do the same thing in regards to stories like Free Willy.  Close your eyes and picture a whale held in a cell just big enough to move in.  This whale is fed every once in a while and he is taught to do tricks so that people can laugh and cheer.  He is separated from his family and his friends and his natural surroundings.  He can hear them crying for him to come home at night.  He has done nothing wrong, committed no crime and he just wants to go home.  But he is kept against his will, for our entertainment.Now picture what I am describing to you isn't a whale.  Picture it as being human.I applaud Richard and Laura Donner for making this film and I certainly hope people can see this and change their thinking about things.  It is a powerful film.  And it is one that should be taken more seriously.

Keiko played the part of the whale terrifically! James did a great job too acting as Jesse, and gave the perfect image of a young boy who has lived on the streets. Some people call it the best friendship movie since ET. This movie rocks over ET!, and shows us the true meaning of friendship.

I didn't see it in the theatre, but I don't think it was too long afterwards when I saw some of it in the VHS format. I don't recall ever seeing the whole thing during my childhood, though I did see the first of the two sequels, Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home, from start to finish one time. When I rented the original Free Willy just yesterday, I could only remember a little bit of it from what I saw back in the 90's. After all these years, I've finally seen the entire film. However, as much as a fair number of other people seem to like it, I definitely didn't find it as entertaining and touching as many have made it out to be, which didn't surprise me after seeing its mediocre rating here first.Jesse is a troubled 12 year old boy who was abandoned by his mother years ago. One night, while getting into mischief with a group of friends, he is caught by the police after vandalizing an aquatic park. His social worker, Dwight Mercer, manages to get him off the hook, provided he cleans up the mess he has made at the park. As Jesse works at the park, he looks in the tank and sees an orca whale named Willy, who was sadly separated from his family in the ocean recently and brought here. The 12 year old boy befriends this whale, and manages to teach him tricks, which nobody else has succeeded in doing. However, it turns out that Willy won't do these tricks in front of a big audience, with kids banging on the tank windows. Dial, the park owner, has an evil plan, and the homesick orca whale's life is in danger! The beginning of the film, showing whales in the ocean, may not be that bad at first, but it's a little too long. After the capture, we are introduced to Jesse, played by Jason James Richter, and it doesn't exactly improve here, which leads me to another slight problem I have with this movie. This problem is the characters. This includes the main kid. At the beginning, he's one rotten little brat, but I guess that can easily happen with the kind of childhood he's had. Yes, much of the film is supposed to be extremely touching, and clearly is to some people, but to me, it just seemed a little too phony. The story may have some occasional mildly touching moments, but they are very brief. There may be a bit of excitement as well, but in the end, despite the fact that I wasn't completely bored throughout, I was still left with indifference. Nothing too overwhelming. I know this is a film about saving whales, and I assure you, I do not approve of the captivity of marine animals. They're meant to live in the ocean, not chlorinated tanks. Still, this movie just didn't quite do it for me. I also know I'm writing this just a couple days after the death of Michael Jackson, who sang the closing theme, Will You Be There, for this movie, but that is of mere coincidence. I didn't know he sang the theme song, nor did I even know what this movie's theme song was, before I rented it yesterday! If I had seen the entire film from start to finish during my childhood, it just might have been a more entertaining and memorable experience than it was for me watching it after growing up. Free Willy should be a nice, moving family drama, but somehow, it fails. Many kids might like it, and adults as well, but in my opinion, it's far from the perfect, heartwarming family film it seems to have often been considered.

It's a semi-good family movie","Date":"11 June 2015","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family","Review":" Whale! Whale! Whale! What do we have here? It's Free Willy and I love blubbering about Free Willy. It's a whale of a tail. It's one of my favorite nostalgia, early 1990s kid films. Directed by Simon Wincer, Free Willy tells the story of a delinquent boy, Jesse (Jason James Richter) who become friends with a captive killer whale, Willy (Keiko). Seeing that Willy was upset due to the absence of his family and the fact, that Willy didn't like his small living conditions; Jesse set up a plan to kidnap Willy, and tries to set him free in the wild. Can Jesse and Willy escape from the cruel owners of aquarium or will Willy end up, being fish food? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; I found the movie to be a bit predictable. After all, the title of the movie, kinda gives it, away. It's not like the movie posters, DVD covers, and trailers, pretty much spoils the outrageous end of the movie, as well. The film's ending has been spoofed several times in popular culture, due to how over the top, it was. It was a bit unrealistic. The movie also suffers from overused clich√©s. I really didn't like the sub-plot of Jesse's handling of his new foster parents. It seem a bit forced and underdevelopment. I really didn't buy into the whole surviving on his own, as a runaway bit. Around thing that was hard to believe, was the chemistry between the whale and the main actor. It was too similar to previous movies of a child bonding with a wild animal like 1966's Namu. I really found the whole idea of Willy connecting with the child, a little impractical. For a creature that been left alone in a small dark tanks for hours, I would have, thought the orca would be a little more aggressed and bite Jesse's head off or try to drown him. It's seem a bit, off. After all, they are killer whales! I guess, Keiko was just that well-trained. While, the film does make a good persuasive case against keeping these creatures in captivity for the purposes of human entertainment by highlighting incidents that Willy has. The movie is a little one-sided argument about whales being in captivity. I find it a tad odd that this movie is basically condemning the very thing it is exploiting which is using captive wild animals for entertainment purposes. The movie also fails to tells how important, some aquariums are, for sick killer whales. Now, every aquarium seem a bit evil. Like the 2013's documentary, Blackfish; viewers of this movie, might not understand, that some places, like SeaWorld honestly, tries hard to keep whales, healthy, enough to return to the wild. Still, when this movie did came out, I was one of those, who really believe that the whale that play Willy should have been free. At least the filmmakers followed their own preaching, and campaigned for the freeing of Keiko, the actual killer whale who stands in for an animatronic Willy in many scenes. The plan for Keiko to return to the wild was a topic of much controversy at the time. Some critics felt that a return to the wild, was somewhat impossible, because of the years of him being in captivity. They were somewhat right, most of the attempts of him going back into the wild were mostly unsuccessful, due to the fact, that he often return, seeking contact with human beings and allowing children to ride on his back. He was so dependent on humans that he really couldn't connection with other whales. In 2003, Keiko sadly die in one last attempt in the wild at the young age of 26 due to Pneumonia. He will be miss. Despite, him, not living long in the wild, I still came out from this movie learning more than I came into the film. I love the fact that this movie help spark the Save the Whales Foundation into a success organization. I love the fact that this movie had singer Michael Jackson produced and performed Will You Be There, as one of the theme songs for the film, which can be heard during the film's credits. The song won the MTV Movie Award for Best Song in a Movie in 1994. It was also included in Michael Jackson's Dangerous album. It's one of his best songs, ever. It really help the save the whales program. The main theme by Basil Poledouris was also amazing and majestic. Even the harmonica music that Jesse plays, wasn't that bad. While, the music was good. The acting, not so much. While, some of the characters strongly express of human emotion like James Jason Richter who work well, on-screen with Keiko. Others were kinda one dimensional. The worst, had to be the over the top money hungry, villain played by Michael Ironsides. He was really hammy. The movie made great use of stock footage of whales. It was really nice, seeing them, in their natural habitat. The movie was followed by three sequels 1995's Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home, 1997's Free Willy 3 The Rescue, and 2010's Free Willy Escape from Pirate's Cove, and a short-lived animated television series. I don't recommended watching the sequels, but I do want you to check out 2010's Keiko The Untold story. It's a documentary film about Keiko that is worth seeing. Overall Despite its cheesy nature, Free Willy is great movie for fans of Marine life. I really enjoy this film.

Whenever I watch this movie, it takes me back to the year this movie came out, 1993. I remember seeing this when it was in the movie theaters, and how my mom bought this movie on a videotape which my parents still have from back then. I remember this movie as part of my childhood, I became obsessed with Free Willy after seeing it. Man, that was a long time ago over 20-years ago. Sometimes, you wish you could relive the days of your childhood. Besides that, I have to say that no matter how old I get, I feel like people will always remember my generation the Millennials form of entertainment we had especially as kids. Some of the kids today prefer what we grew up with compared to what they are growing up with.So, here is what makes this movie great. Well, again if you saw this movie when you were a kid, it will take you back to your childhood, be a trip down memory lane. You'll even understand the movie now better than when you were a kid. It can be a fun educational form of entertainment. I remember studying Killer Whales/Orcas as a kid. This movie will tell you a lot about them that you probably don't even know as an adult. It's a really happy and entertaining kind of movie. When I watch this movie, it makes me really happy. It's beautiful to see the kind of friendship we see between a kid named Jesse who was abandoned by his mother, and a killer whale held alone in captivity. I'm sure the actor who played Jesse, Jason James Richter is most remembered for this movie, I can't think of any other movies or TV shows he's been in besides these Free Willy movies. They've done 4 Free Willy movies. I've only seen the first two, but the first one is the best. I feel like the second one doesn't seem canon as often times sequels don't seem canon. The 4th one which I haven't seen has a new actress and is a different story. They occasionally do that with movies. Have a movie that's part of the franchise, and while it's a relatable story it's completely different. Like with Home Alone. The first two are the ones we remember the most with Kevin McAllister and his family. They've done 3 more since then, and the last 3 are not relatable minus the slapstick humor and having a kid who is supposed to be Kevin McAllister in the 4th movie.I can't think of too many movies at the top of my head, but there are lots of movies showing the friendship between a kid and an animal. Recent movies which are based on true stories are the two Dolphin Tale movies. I've seen them, and they are wholesome movies that will help you feel good. However, they definitely are not as entertaining as Free Willy. Free Willy is arguably the best movie showing the friendship between some kid and an animal.

But those flabbergasting twists are what makes Free Willy a good movie. It never ran out of good ideas to convolute the screen portrayal so that the audience may be stimulated. In fact, boredom seldom touched me, being an audience and a critic.There were just some scenes that irritates me because I believe that the producers could have intensified these sequences even more by adding some action scenes so that they may be able to add a greater tension on the viewers and that the audience may really feel and take in what is happening on screen.The animatronic stand-in that was used in most close-up scenes of Willy also was quite good. There was never a time when the CGIs (Computer Generated Effects) failed. They really looked like real and natural. And the stunts made, although was created with the extensive use of CGI, was perfect and was pleasing to the eyes.The screen portrayal of the actors and actresses also were quite good and was enough to please the audience.The musical scoring of the movie was satisfactory, nevertheless. It was good especially during the crises of the movie, but I was expecting for more since musical scoring are a great factor to catch the audience.I guess there's not much to say about this movie because I believe that its succeeding sequels are enough to prove how successful the movie is and that couldn't have been achieved if the quality was poor.

Like their kin the dolphins, there was just something magical and awesome about them just in their very presence that displays their astounding intellect and friendliness. So the movie Free Willy was right up my alley as a kid. Now nearing adulthood, and still fascinated with orcas, the movie does not strike with the same impact, but most of it is still remains and thus, I still thoroughly enjoy Free Willy. For those not familiar with the story, mainly meaning those who did not grow up in the 1990s, the film is about a boy in foster care (Jason James Richter) who upon committing vandalism at a local aquatic park near the coast is given the task of cleaning up his act. And during his visits, he befriends a captured and neglected killer whale (Keiko), whom he soon realizes is planning to be destroyed as a failure attraction. And before long, the story unfolds into just what the title hints an effort to free Willy.Looking again on Free Willy years after I saw it for the first time, I can still see the charm and majesty that had fascinated me in my youth. Director Simon Wincer's major achievement in this film is not trying to make it spectacular, but trying to make it cute and harmless and magical and although my opinion is merely divided amongst the rest of the moviegoers, I say he succeeded in all regards. I thought it was a very moving and touching story about friendship between this boy and this whale, both of whom are troubled, and the way that they struggle to save not only themselves, but also each other. And it doesn't carry away to the point where it seems like Willy the whale has become super-intelligent, but bases all of his motives on instincts. And at the same time, we feel sympathy for this six-ton, sharp-toothed denizen of the sea especially when we compare his massive size to the relatively small container that he's placed in, the rough treatment he's given, and when he cries for companionship.In regards to Willy, it's quite an achievement. As many know, in a lot of scenes, the whale was represented by Keiko, a real-life orca who actually shared many of his character's situations during his lifetime, and this adds to the genuine realism and the touching moments of the film. In other scenes, such as the rescue, Willy is portrayed by a well-realized animatronic and the two blend so well together it's impossible to tell which one is which. There is only once lapse in the special effects and that regards to the CGI whale that was used for the final scene in the movie and people familiar with the film should know what I'm talking about. The computer graphics in that shot, which was thankfully brief, was detailed but not convincing. Nevertheless, that's a minor fault in an otherwise impeccable special effects effort for an entire motion picture.What's also commendable is how the whale does not become the only interesting character or aspect in the film. Free Willy also has a great human drama story subplot to boast, to keep us interested during the scenes where the boy and the whale do not share the same shot. I liked Jason James Richter as the boy, and I especially liked Michael Madsen as the foster parent trying to serve as a father figure and also August Schellenberg and Lori Petty as some of the few friends that the boy and his aquatic friend have around them.Again, looking back on Free Willy and having read some of the criticisms leveled against it, the movie does not fascinate me with the same power that it once did some years ago. But it's still a sweet, charming story with a warm heart and it still works for me.

Think LASSIE as a harmless 3-ton marine mammal, specifically a 3-ton Killer Whale, and you got the concept of FREE WILLY. But don't let the predictable fluffy areas fool you! This is a surprisingly charming and oftentimes wonderful twist on the boy-and-his-dog plot line. It's sweet, a little predictable to be sure, but a noble and quite impressive movie of its kind. If your looking for a harmless, but entertaining, family diversion, I suggest to take a shot on FREE WILLY. If you don't find yourself assured, a rental might be fine.Perhaps one of the startling affair about FREE WILLY is that it doesn't solely concern the dog (the animal), but finds its time to for the boy as well. Instead of a movie heavily devoted on the save-the-animals aspect of the fable, FREE WILLY finds time to make the human dimension interesting and relevant. The boy of the story is Jessie (Jason James Richter), an orphaned boy forced to run amok the streets hang out with a bunch of trouble-makers. He picked the wrong place to mess with when he stumbles upon a too-small tank of a 3-ton Orca in captivity. Since he sprayed graffiti all over the walls, Jessie is sanctioned to clean the place up. He's also going to be assigned to his new adoptive parents (played by Michael Madsen and Jayne Atkinson). The moments where Jessie tries to adapt to his life under foster-parenthood isn't one of the film's best scenes, but granted, they're welcome addition to an otherwise predictable fare.Still, the moments between Jessie and the gigantic cetacean, as played by Sea World attraction Keiko as well as a believable animatronic double, is what basically FREE WILLY is all about. The moments between the boy and his whale are sweet and often tear-jerking on some occasions. Sure this thing has more Save the Whales slogan than any other film I've ever seen dealing with the same subject, but FREE WILLY does so with shamelessly but not dully. The movie doesn't make us go Yeah sure! Save the whales already!. It does its predictable and preachy elements with relevance. We care about these characters, and to what might happen to them.The movie isn't flawless of course. With slightly glacial-paced midsection and a number of schmaltzy substance, FREE WILLY isn't free from its faults. But for sweet, feather-weight family entertainment, FREE WILLY still holds water. Your kids might love it. You might love it too. Consider that the surprise bonus in this cheerful little tale.Rating **** out of 5.

One night, Jesse and Perry, one of his friends, venture into a wild animal water park and decorate the place with graffiti. Jesse is caught and placed in a foster home The Greenwoods. They seem like yuppies, but they've got hearts of gold. Jesse didn't take too much of a liking to them.          He was also put on probation to clean up the mess he made at Northwest Adventure Park. His employer is a man named Randolph.He's a Native American who has all sorts of Orca statues and stories at his house. That was also the day Jesse met Willy, a giant killer whale, and that would be the start of a fabulous friendship. Willy took an immediate liking to Jesse. Jesse acted as trainer and they put on a small show for the cureators of the park. They saw big bucks in having a show for the entire public! But that plan was yet to backfire in their faces!         Either Willy was nervous about being around so many people or he had a migrain from the endless tapping on the glass of the underground observation area by a bunch of bratty kids. Either way, the show was a disaster. Jesse was heart broken, as well as aggrivated. Their friendship was in jeopardy, not to mention Willy's life, because some men were sabotaging the tank. Jesse woke Randolph and fellow trainer, Ray, and they worked hard to lift Willy from the tank and get him back to the ocean. The plan was called Operation Free Willy. How would they tow the trailer with a giant whale on it? Glenn, Jesse's new foster father, let them borrow his truck--without him knowing it. They finally make it to the ocean, but some whale hunters were out to stop them. Willy would have to jump a stonewall to freedom--and he does it!

Also offering a good performance was August Schellenberg as Randolph, the native man who works at the aquarium Willy is held at. Undoubtedly the weakest performance came from Lori Petty as Rae, Willie's trainer. I can't really judge her performance fairly, though, because she wasn't given much to do except smile, watch in awe as Jesse works with Willy, and walk around in a bathing suit. I also thought that Michael Ironside offered a rather uninspired performance as Mr. Dial, Willy's owner, who is quite happy to let the whale die in order to collect the insurance money.Those relatively weak performances aside, however, the movie was still enjoyable enough, and I rated this one as an 8/10.

So they decide to open The Willy Show, with the help of marina owner Dial (Michael Ironside) and Willy's capturers and carers.

So with some help from Lori, Randolph and his carers, Glen (Michael Madsen) and Annie Greenwood (Jayne Atkinson), Jesse and Willy set off towards the ocean to free him. The moment where Willy leaps over the rock wall is obviously the pinnacle of the film, and the end credits feature the great Michael Jackson song, Will You Be There.

I watched it every single day, wore out two VHS tapes, and now have the DVD. I think the acting is great, especially Jason James Richter's performance as Jesse. He did a fantastic job at displaying all of the emotions Jesse felt throughout the movie, especially in the ending. I always cry at the end of this movie and I honestly believe that if it weren't for Richter's acting, I might not be as effected by this movie. He does a magnificent job at portraying the character development and changes in Jesse. The storyline itself is pretty believable, until the jump at the ending, but its obvious that it isn't meant to be realistic, but inspiring. The bond between Jesse and Willy feels very powerful in this movie, more so than in the second and third, in my opinion. When watching, I can't help but feel like there's a genuine connection between Richter and Keiko. Overall, a very heartwarming, inspiring story about what friendship can accomplish, and that its always best to do what's right, even if its painful (Jesse didn't want to say goodbye for Willy, but had to look out for him and do what's best for him). One of the best movies about the bond between a child and an animal.

Now, several years later, I bought it again on DVD just yesterday. I watched it back, and even though it's clearly a children's movie, I was filled with nostalgia and I fell in love with this movie again, even through an adults view. The concept of a friendship with an animal that wild, powerful, big, gracious and un-pet-like, used to stimulate my imagination as a kid, and the movie still knew how to charm me. To see how the connection between Willy and Jesse develops is a moving thing to see. So it's not true that only kids can enjoy it, I still loved it even now. You should judge it in the perspective of the target age group it's meant for, it's a great children's movie. One of the greatest, if you ask me. They don't make 'em like these anymore.Main actor Jason James Richter is great as Jesse, he has a lot of charisma, and his acting is very natural. I also have always liked the character Randolph, the wise Indian guy. He just makes the Free-Willy-picture complete somehow.Moving story, and fantastically performed. Show your kids this one, and not the remake. It's a pleasure to all the family.

Its looks like the Puget Sound area in and around Washington State. I would be very grateful for a reply. I enjoyed the movie but I don't care for Michael Jackson. My mother thinks that it was filmed in Canada . I would like to get any information that you could give me on this subject. It was very disturbing when Keiko passed away . I would also like to know where or if the Northwest Adventure Park is real or is it a staged area . I am just South of Olympia Washington and am curious as to that information. Is any part of this movie filmed in the State of Washington. Thank you for your time and consideration on this subject.

The part where the orphan boy eats all that cake was magical. I was very disappointed when the cops showed and he couldn't eat more of that scrumptious cake. The cake has a lot to do with the young boys relationship with that Indian and willy. In the end you could say that Willy really takes the cake, but in the beginning it's certainly that short blond haired whale trainer who takes the cake. the Indian is an underthought character because he doesn't explain his love for the cake. The movie does have a rather sad ending, it is true that willy jumps over an entire island and gains his freedom but it's also true that the orphan boy doesn't ever get back that cake. The boy would have rather had another birthday cake than have willy be free anyday. When the a couple of the skateboarding goons in the beginning step in the birthday cake this is basically the catalyst of all that's to come to whales and humans alike. The notion of this movie is, we can steal a greak looking birthday cake but there's no certainty that some dirty street kid won't step on it fleeing from the cops. The birthday cake taught me that life is entropy and there's nothing we can do control our destinies. I am also eating cake right now.

First, it's about an orphaned boy who lives on the streets.  Second, it's about a killer whale who's been separated from his family and taken to a sea park.  I really hate this film, my mom hates it as well, but I guess it's good that they made it because it sends a message that large whales like Willy should not be in captivity.

I naively ignored the health warning on the box, and watched it.  Since then, the minion has been tortured to death with a pencil.  It has the most ridiculous plot I have ever heard of.  Whoever wrote it should be thrown in my dungeon with Glen Hoddle and the Spice girls.  When the kid fell in the tank, I really wished he would drown. Perhaps I should mention at this point that I wasn't mad BEFORE I watched it.  Overall, watching this film will result in severe dementia, and a waste of a perfectly good pencil.

No, it wasn't really because of all the animal abuse involved (the REAL Willy was not released at the end but returned to captivity--had he read the script, he wouldn't have gotten his hopes up). Instead, it was because of a fundamental flaw--I simply HATED the kid who was Willy's friend. This little sociopath was supposedly fixed by his tender friendship with a whale?! Gimme a break--in real-life, I would have expected the kid to poison the whale and sell it by the pound on the black market! And this kid is a big jerk throughout much of the movie BUT we are supposed to listen to HIM when he tells us he cares? I didn't want Willy to jump OVER the kid at the end of the movie, but land ON him--thus doing everyone a favor!The bottom line is that the film is very predictable, difficult to believe and has contempt for the intelligence of the audience. For a MUCH better kids' movie about Orcas, see the New Zealand film, WHALE RIDER.

Like the fact that it's a family film is a sign of greatness or something. The Michael Jackson soundtrack is a joke, the whale who plays Willy unimpressive and the main star is horrible. Michael Madsen and Lori Petty are embarrassing in their supporting roles. One of the worst of the 90's. And because of IMDb's ten lines roles, I have to fill this space with useless crap about the movie and how bad it is. It's bad. I'd give it less than a star if I could. And they're making a Free Willy 4 next year. That's how bad it is. Somebody needs to free me from seeing these piece of crap films.

I can be, but it doesn't take away the fact that this is the sort of formulaic phlegm that makes me proud that I'm that pain-in-the-arse amateur film critic most people hate.Gawd, this is an awful movie. At one point the goodies threaten the baddies' lives (human lives, mind you) to protect the title's blob of blubber.Oh, well. Forget the morality. If you must watch this crap, enjoy the fact that any kiddies in the room will probably be stuck to the screen, rooting on the whale, and your spousal unit will be thanking you for not being a jerk.Glub.
