[{"Title":"A fun, witty, exuberant treatment of Shakespeare","Date":"2 July 1999","Score":"40 out of 43 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This is a film version of a Shakespeare play the way Shakespeare would have wanted it to be seen - as funny and entertaining.  The gorgeous colour in the sets and costumes reminds us that this story is taking place in sunny Italy - maybe it takes an Italian director to realize and bring out that light-hearted joyfulness.  The actors are all wonderful, so natural in their roles that the Shakespearean verse sounds like believable daily conversation. Richard Burton is perfect as Petruchio, a self-confident, swaggering lout at the beginning, who in a way undergoes his own taming process to become a loving husband, proud of his wife and delighted with the happiness ahead of them.  Elizabeth Taylor as an actress is not really up to the demands of Shakespeare, but she certainly looks her part, and on the whole does pretty well, especially as she is given a lot of action rather than speaking in this film, until the very end.  Zeffirelli does wonderful things with the visuals - the scene at the beginning, when what appears to be a solemn church service suddenly erupts into a wild carnival can be seen as a joking reflection of the typical viewer's reaction to this happy treatment of Shakespeare; where we expect to be bored by solemn, po-faced reverence in the presence of Art, we suddenly find ourselves swept away in a merry romp.  And the recurring glimpses of a huge grotesque blonde woman continually attended by her small, dark-haired pretty sister, always scaring away the latter's possible suitors is a witty summary of the main story we are watching.  This movie is a great introduction to Shakespeare for anyone who hasn't seen his plays before, and a perfect antidote for anyone who's been intimidated into thinking that Shakespeare is too hard for anyone but experts and scholars to understand.

It is full of color and fun, and some very fine comedy.  All of the actors are brilliant in it. It's a big, romping chase of a movie, and when you hear Petruchio's deep chuckle, it makes you laugh, too.It's based on the bare bones of Shakespeare's play about Baptista, a rich man with two unmarried daughters.  The older daughter is so nasty that no one can stand her long enough to marry her, and everyone in town wants to marry the younger daughter but can't till the older is married off.  A bad-mannered fortune hunter shows up and agrees to take the older daughter off the father's hands for a steep price.  After the marriage, Petruchio sets about breaking the pride of Kate, and eventually he wears her down, but she works her own magic on him, and in the end they both find that they love each other.Richard Burton should have won the Oscar for this role; he IS Petruchio. It's a national disgrace that he didn't get it. And Liz is really good as Kate.  She makes us believe that she is a horrible shrew, and when her soft side emerges she makes us believe that she could have been sweet all along.If you can find this film at all, try to watch it in it's letterbox version. You miss far too much of the action in the pan and scan format.  It's shown on cable quite a bit, but mostly on the pay channels.

Although Liz Taylor had no experience of playing &#145;the bard' she is actually entertaining as Kate, that fiery girl who has no intention of becoming any man's plaything or possession.  Richard Burton is on surer ground as Petruchio and doesn't disappoint, this is a rip-roaring performance and one of his best.In Zeffirelli's cast we also see Michael Hordern, Cyril Cusack, Natasha Pyne (as Kate's sister Bianca), and Michael York (making his film debut as Bianca's suitor).  The action can drag a bit when away from the leads (who always did tend to swamp other players in their movies), but the wit and mischief of the original play shines through.  My only quibble would be with Kate's final speech.  Interesting that Taylor plays it this way, but my guess is that it isn't the end of the bumpy ride for these two!

Although many suitors beg for Bianca's hand, her widowed father is determined that she may not marry until her elder sister Katherine is wed--and Katherine is a hot tempered, willful, and vicious woman who makes life miserable for all who cross her path. Fortunately for Bianca, Petruchio is in need of money, and he is more than willing to marry Kate, no matter how resistant Kate herself is to the whole idea.Shakespeare's original script has been trimmed here and there, and while purists may scream about it the result not only works for film, it also manages to capture the flavor of Shakespeare's language much better than any other film version of SHREW both before or since. And the look of the thing is beautiful Zeffirelli brings his mastery of opera's larger than life visuals to bear upon the project, and the result is eye-popping production values, most particularly in reference to the costuming. Every cent spent shows on the screen.Although she was a very fine screen actress, Elizabeth Taylor is not a name one would expect to find playing Shakespeare--but she carries it off in fine style, kicking, snapping, and snarling with tremendous panache in the first portion of the film, and then making Kate's taming seem entirely plausible in the latter portion. Unlike many later Shakespeare plays, SHREW is not greatly noted for its language; even so, Katherine's final speech is widely known and extremely memorable, and Taylor pulls it off with such credibility that one wishes she had done other classical roles as well.Taylor's then-husband Richard Burton co-stars as the deliberately uncouth Petruchio, who sets out to tame a shrew and finds himself as much tamed by her as she by him. Burton, of course, was accustomed to the classics in general and Shakespeare in particular, and he plays with tremendous bravado. The supporting cast, which includes a young Michael York, is also very fine, and when all is said and done the 1964 THE TAMING OF THE SHREW is a tremendous amount of fun even if you don't like Shakespeare.The DVD transfer is very nice. The picture has the occasional blemish, most often in the opening titles and closing credits, but on the whole it is remarkable, showing every detail of every set and every costume to fine effect. The sound is also quite good. Sad to say, there is really nothing in the way of bonus material, but the film is the thing, and Taylor, Burton, York, and Zefirelli do it up brown.

But it wouldn't be enough  without a terrific Kate, and Elizabeth Taylor, certainly in her prime in 1967, more than  fills the bill. She hams it up when hamming is appropriate to the moment, and plays it  with more subtlety when that is required. She is well matched by Richard Burton as  Petruchio. He is good, but there is something not quite there. I think perhaps  he seems more jaded and a tad less calculating than I'd expect in the role.

He's wonderful as Petruchio and she acquits herself well as the shrewish Katharine.Michael Hordern is the harried father of the lovely Bianca and her older sister, the beautiful, but independent Katherine. The sisters, Natasha Pyne and Elizabeth Taylor are as different as they come. Young Michael York is most interested in Pyne, but Hordern wants to see the older daughter married off at first. But Taylor scares off would be suitors.Enter Richard Burton who's a roguish fortune hunter, but Hordern is quite willing to overlook that if he'll just take Taylor off his hands. The rest of the film concerns both Burton and York's parallel quests for their mates.The Taming of the Shrew is probably best known to today's audience as the basis for Cole Porter's biggest Broadway success, Kiss Me Kate. Yet it's still stands well on its own as William Shakespeare's most rollicking comedy and a medieval treatise on feminism. Yet even when it's over, you're not quite sure just how submissive of a medieval wife Elizabeth Taylor will be.Director Franco Zefirelli recreated medieval Padua with a great eye for detail. In that wedding, I'm sure he must have gotten Richard Burton good and plastered for the scene. Burton was one of the most legendary imbibers in screen history, but that scene was way too real to be just acting.Laurence Olivier supposedly once told Richard Burton that he had a choice of being the greatest classical actor of his generation or a movie star. Too which Burton is supposed to have replied that he wanted both. I think he succeeded with The Taming of the Shrew.

Encore!!!","Date":"12 November 2005","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Perhaps one of the more entertaining Shakespearean adaptations to make the screen during the 60′s, Zefferelli is a master at using exquisite set design to compliment his films. The Taming of the Shrew is no exception in this regard, and it is the attention to detail that gets the production out of the many potholes it falls into. Adapted from Shakespeare's play, the story focuses on the brutish and obnoxious Petruchio (Burton) who arrives in Padua to find a wealthy wife. Signor Baptista, an elderly gentleman from Padua wearily attempts to find a husband for his eldest daughter Katherina (Taylor), a self-willed shrew. Petruchio, determined to make Katherina his wife embarks on humorous escapades to woo her and loosen her independent ways.The film is naturally light-hearted due to Zefferelli's fusion of mild slapstick with the original Shakespeare narrative. This particular comedic tone makes the film problematic and there are moments where the lead actors appear uncertain of their next move or utterance. For example there is the dreadful song, which Burton is required to sing, 'Where is the life that late I lead', dreadful in composition and in performance. Considering Burton was renowned for his voice, the fact that the song still comes across as cringe worthy despite his panache in deliverance, is a testament to the poor musical composition. It is also surprisingthat Zefferelli decided to keep the song in the film as it is distracting and an uncomfortable moment. Burton's dialogue has also been dubbed over in ADR in some parts and to the trained eye, this is very noticeable and equally disruptive.The film does give Richard Burton a chance that he was rarely given in his under-appreciated career. A chance to act with excellent dialogue, story and supporting actors. Particularly in the oh-so-hilariously named scene 'Kate on a Hot Tin Roof' (a nod to Taylor's 1956 portrayal of Maggie in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof). The scene sees Petruchio chase his bride to be across the roof of her fathers house and fall through into an abandoned barn. Although it is highly contrived and at times plainly clear to see that Taylor is fearlessly tip-toeing across the 'roof' with a safety net mere inches below her, the scene is saved by Burton's outstanding talent and Taylor's ability to use that shrill, irritating voice to good effect.The Taming of the Shrew also allowed for Elizabeth Taylor to give one of the best performances of her career &#x96; when she wants to. (Many myself included, consider her role as Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? to be her best.)The controversial final sequence of The Taming of The Shrew sees Taylor shine as she speaks of the stupidity of women to wage a war of independence against their husbands when they should in fact, 'kneel for peace'. Granted, Shakespeare wasn't exactly known for his liberating views on women in society, but Taylor delivers a performance that is as believable as it is entertaining, particularly as the audience knows she would sooner have danced on Shaky's grave than adhere to his strict admonitions about marriage!Regardless of the comical contrasts that are immediately obvious between Taylor and her character, she shows the amateurs how it's done in this scene.Despite the films discrepancies with ADR timing and musicality, there are many excellent scenes. The dialogue is naturally innovative as one would expect from Monsieur Shakespeare. The Taming of the Shrew remained a film that Burton and Taylor were always proud of, so much so that they put $1,000,000 of their own money into the production (a fact that they both seemed overly keen to mention in the 'Making of' featurette). Not a film that will change anyone's life but well worth watching for entertainment value and a must for Taylor-Burton fans.

She is just uncomfortable delivering Shakespeare's words. However,the action scenes(Petruccio's wooing of Kate) are very enjoyable.  A strong supporting cast helps the film greatly. In particular Alan Webb's fussy old Gremio,Victor Spinneli's foppish Hortensio and Sir Michael Hordern's comiclly downtrodden Baptista.

Burton was of that English stock of actors who first would engineer the words in designing the character. Then he would figure out the bodily and facial motions. The reading was the core. That belief comes in part from the minute variations in speech that discriminate class in Britain.Burton was fresh from his/her success in Woolf, a project that was engineered differently, one in which the words don't matter as much as how they support the weaving of the characters. Mike Nichols stuff.Zeffirelli has a different motive altogether. His notion is to take something inherently rich -- which is how he sees Shakespeare's plays -- and increase that enrichment with the addition of cinematic luxury.Add to this mix old Will himself. He's all about situation, at least in the comedies of this period. Disguises, and hidden stratagems that misdirect. Everything is annotation to that, starting with the poetry, then the language, then -- and only then -- the characters and finally and only nominally the set.Four different theatrical notions. Here they are squeezed together without merging Burton working his vocal shapes to death in the context of a Nichols-like combat between the then two most famous actors alive. Both him and Zeffirelli picking and choosing which phrases to selectively use to support their conflicting goals. And around those phrases Zeffirelli swirls with exiting visuals and music.What a hash. You should know that Shakespeare wrote comedies set in Italy because Italians were seen as comical. The way they elaborated language apart from meaning. The way they dressed where the decor had nothing to do with the purpose, so far outstripping it that by Elizabethan conventions just seeing an Italian in dress would elicit guffaws. Shakespeare's plays were essentially without sets, so some of the language would be designed to have the audience imagine a humorous excess of surrounding.Now along comes an Italian to reshape the plays. And he brings the very excess that is the whole tenor of the joke. And along comes an actor that -- quite independent of that -- wants to turn what is a tussle of words into a tussle of emotions. This is also an Italian flaw that Elizabethans would have laughed at.So instead of mining the inherent richness of the play, we mine the inherent ridiculousness around which the play builds its riches. That ridiculousness is enriched in appropriately ridiculous ways campy theatrical rage; astoundingly colorful clothes (influencing and influenced by The Beatles and later to form the basis of their clothing store run by the aptly named Fool), and swirling motion of the crowds.Everybody loses. To see how a similar mix can actually work, see how Emma and Ken spar -- but WITH the language -- in his Much Ado About Nothing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.

Nevertheless this play is very problematic, as Shakespeare's wife-taming narrative, in conjunction with the protagonists' inquisitive reticence regarding her disposition, makes it a challenging play to implement today, as ideas about a forgotten historical background as well as ideas of gender and marriage have changed considerably since the 1500's. Set in 1850, Shakespeare's play tells the tale of the penniless Petruchio who comes 'to wive and thrive' as he ensnares Katherina, a rough, stark mad, obstinate shrew, then sets about viciously pulverizing her morale, in the effort of 'taming' her and re-establishing his wealth. At first, Katherina is a reluctant partake in the liaison, but Petruchio hits her with several psychological afflictions&#x97;the taming&#x97;until she transforms into a submissive, devoted and perfect wife. The subplot presents a contest amongst the admirers of Katherina's more enticing sister, Bianca. 'The Taming of The Shrew' is the foundation for a sub-genre of Shakesploitation flicks, whereby they cite Shakespeare in films, such as '10 Things I Hate about You' (dir.Gil Junger, 1999), which is based on 'The Taming of the Shrew', presenting a Shakespearean subject as a theme. The Taming of the Shrew commences with a framing scheme, identified as the Induction, whereby a roguish nobleman deceives a drunken character, Christopher Sly into thinking that he is in fact a lord. The nobleman then has the play enacted for Sly's amusement, describing it as a comedy-a practical joke, juxtaposing the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet with a Shakespearean comedy, characterized by a universal classification that has some fundamental procedures and melodrama techniques a witty and light-hearted nature; ingenious prose and humorous teasing; trickery, disguises, youthful love that must conquer some type of struggle; incidents of mistaken identity; household drama; unforeseen events; and numerous scenarios that ultimately amalgamate&#x96; which consistently encompasses the reunion of a household and/or a marriage. The Taming of the Shrew has an alluring outlook on relationships, on authority, on sexual roles and on marriage. Yet, because of the era in which it was composed, The Taming of the Shrew is a production whereby sequences of objectionably exploitive actions are carried out on a woman. By placing a contemporary framework around Shakespeare's play, the audience has to try to recognize the dilemmas presented to us, as a contemporary audience, in an approach that is humorous, passionate and intriguing. Franco Zeffirelli's big screen interpretation of Shakespearean comedy is portrayed in a humorous and pleasurable manner. The stunning coloring in the apparel and stage sets point out to us that the adventure is presenting itself in sunny Italy - perhaps it takes an Italian director to appreciate and succeed in accomplishing that airy merriment. Zeffirelli's cast are pleasing and believable in their characters' roles in that the Shakespearean lyric resembles a natural everyday discussion. Richard Burton plays Petruchio; an arrogant, boastful lout in the opening, in some ways goes through his own taming measures, in becoming a devoted companion, satisfied with his wife and looking to their future ahead. Elizabeth Taylor, who plays Katherina, is not really up to Shakespearean standards, nonetheless she undoubtedly looks the part, and considering for the most part, she provides a great deal of action in place of conversational dialogue within the film, prior to the ending scene. Zeffirelli creates magnificent effects with the graphics, such as the act at the beginning of the film, when he gives the impression of there being an earnest religious ceremony taking place, which unexpectedly breaks out into a chaotic festival. This can be viewed as a humorous observation of a quintessential audiences' response to the joyful approach to Shakespeare's work; whereby the audience expect to be uninterested by the intense, humorless worship in the presence of Art, as the audience unexpectedly notice themselves swept away in a cheerful frolic. The frequent sights of a large incongruous fair-haired woman constantly accompanied by her petite, well-mannered attractive sister, all the time discouraging her sisters potential admirers is a clever analysis of the drama being viewed.

Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, the famed Shakespeare enthusiast whose works include the successful later adaption of Romeo and Juliet in 1968, this film showcases his devout love of Shakespearean plays. Zeffirelli was clearly ahead of his game at the time, which can be shown through his use of some of the best resources Hollywood had to offer; including leading actress Elizabeth Taylor and Actor Richard Burton.The film boasts the use of prodigy Nino Rota's music which draws the audience into the atmosphere of the film and gets them hooked on the storyline. The set and costumes are immaculate; they truly lead the viewer to believe that it is set in the late 1500's. Attention-to-detail is impressively significant; fine details in the background, such as a labelled drunkard hanging in a cage over the street, are what intensify the film's quality greatly. There is one point in which Lucentio's accomplice talks directly to the camera about the situation and I found that this brought an interesting touch to the camera work; it almost felt as though I was part of the film! The script is also relatively similar to Shakespeare's original text and some memorable line's such Petruchio claiming Will you, Nill you, I will Marry you are none the less brought to life by Burton's macho voice. The fiery character of Katharina is also brilliantly portrayed through Taylor's acting, although some could argue that perhaps she should have toned down her make-up and overacting in a role such as this. The priest's obvious fear of Katharina is shown at the marriage ceremony; a fear which is only too common in the story! Humour is rarely used vocally in the film, but it seems as though Katharina's rages and reactions, as well as a personal comedic key point of Petruchio chuckling as well as engaging in a choking fit during the marriage ceremony, appear to be examples of the type of humour seen in the film. Compared to the original text, it could be said that the humour was quenched and replaced with a more modern quirky version.However, it is inevitable that one would notice that this film seems to focus overly on the characters of Katharina and Petruchio, even perhaps on the real life relationship of Taylor and Burton, as this was filmed during their first marriage. The couple lived their lives in the eyes of the media and I somewhat got the impression that Zeffirelli may have used this to his advantage in order to secure more popularity for his film. The power of Elizabeth Taylor as an actress is highlighted and despite that fact that her character is quite unattractive to the audience, I found that towards the end of the film, I had almost become a fanatic of her and was interested in viewing more of her work. The role of a young, unmarried girl is almost unrealistic for her as she was in her thirties when the film was released. The chemistry between Taylor and Burton positively enhances the impact of the film and it is undeniable that the pair are profoundly comfortable with each other, even though the storyline tells a different story. On the other hand, it is noticeable that other characters in the film were very much in the shadow of Katharina and Petruchio. The character of Bianca seems to have gotten much less attention in the film than I had expected, which I disagree with as she is the cause that led to Petruchio trying to woo Katharina.The film had flaws which were more substantial than the previous. Petruchio's mental abuse of Katharina after their marriage in the film was short of appalling. I found that, at times, I became quite uncomfortable during the film and would have preferred if Zeffirelli had perhaps sugar-coated some of Petruchio's harsh actions. Katharina's spirit is more so shown as broken, as opposed to her personality being tamed, which added an unwanted melancholy touch to the film. The duration of the film was likewise exhausting, as I perceived that my attention diminished at times.Over all, The Taming of the Shrew is an enjoyable film, but unfortunately it is not suited to modern audiences, as some aspects may disgruntle viewers, particularly feminists. At the time of its production, it was of remarkable quality, but in today's world it is somewhat timeworn. However, older audiences would definitely gain a thriller from watching the film and viewers of any age would kindly warm to the character of Katharina and even Elizabeth Taylor as an actress, as I believe that amongst Cleopatra, this film is doubtlessly one of the greatest showcases of her career.

Directed with visual flair and a great deal of energy, yet star-couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (ideally suited to the material though they are) do uneven work. Burton seems to believe cackling his way through his role will suffice, while Taylor's mincing little post-Taming smiles aren't completely convincing (her best scene is her initial one, leaning out the window). Whole sequences such as the wedding ceremony and the final gamble fail to take off, this mainly due to the slapdash timing and a general lack of focus. Zeffirelli is wonderful with the small details but grand-scale storytelling seems to hinder him. A modest success at the box-office, the film set the stage for Zeffirelli's follow-up, 1968's Romeo and Juliet, which finally made the Bard '60s accessible. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Shakespeare as performed by the Two Stooges","Date":"26 July 2007","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were the '60s equivalent of Brangelina or TomKatt - a couple more celebrated as gossip fodder than their work. O, would that this had been another play, or that they had been 15 years younger, or that another director than Signor Franco Zeffirelli had taken on this project. As it is, Taylor's fabled beauty has started to fade, she is obviously no young girl, and there's no chemistry that I can see between ... well, anybody in the production, but especially not between the stars. Learning his lesson, Zeffirelli went on to direct one of the most commercially successful Shakespeare films the next year, but with the leads played by kids that looked the part - Romeo and Juliet was a huge hit, partially because it spoke so well to the young audience it was aimed at (but also because it's a bulletproof play, unlike this one). My impression of the play as written is that it's kind of a problem play anyway - if Shakespeare were writing it for TV, it would be a failed sitcom. So it's not like this is a travesty, sullying the eternal beauty of a masterpiece like Macbeth or King Lear. The script appears to be a Cliff's Notes version of the play - large sections of the film are without a word of dialog - and, depending on your point of view, this may be the best thing about the film - it's already cringe-inducing enough seeing Burton pretend to chase Taylor through barns and cotton bales, without having to try to think if the dialog has anything whatsoever to do with all of the prankish stage business. I found myself thinking that somewhere in here there really can be a witty, amusing, subtle and entertaining play - this isn't that performance.The only thing that really redeems this for me is part of Burton's performance. Occasionally, in spite of everything he, Zeffirelli, and the costume designer can do to obscure the fact, he can act, and delivers a scene here and there that shows that he might be worthwhile seeing in other Shakespeare roles (like his Hamlet a few years earlier). Other than that, the continuous slapstick gags, the visual noisiness of the production, and the fact that this is a very strange play in the first place, make this pretty tough sledding for non-fans of LizAndDick.

"},{"Title":"Intro to Taylor","Date":"29 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Franco Zeffirelli's 1967 feature The Taming of the Shrew acted as my introduction to Elizabeth Taylor. Elizabeth Taylor was an actress I had often heard about yet never seen in any films. In this film, Elizabeth Taylor acted with her husband at the time Richard Burton in one of their 11 films together. The two exuded brilliant on- screen chemistry, as you would hope any married couple would as they play a married couple on-screen. As I'm sure he did in real life, Richard Burton's Petruchio had his hands full with his shrew for a wife, Katharina. The fair, young Bianca (Natasha Pyne) cannot take a husband until her older sister Katharina does; as proclaimed by their father, Baptista (Michael Hordern) The problem is, Katharina is a shrew with no interest to marry and devote herself to a man. Hopelessly in love with Bianca, Lucentio (Michael York) poses as a tutor just to remain in close proximity to Bianca. Yet another man after the heart of Bianca, Hortensio (Victor Spinetti) devises a plan to sling Cupid's arrow at Katharina in order to lift Bianca's marriage ban. Hortensio finds the perfect suitor in Petruchio (Richard Burton) the money focused miscreant who recently arrived in town. Petruchio's desires are also fulfilled if he successfully marries Katharina, as he is searching for a wealthy wife. Once Petruchio is warned about Katharina's fiery temper and brash disposition and ensured that the debt he incurred winning her love will be paid for by Gremio (Alan Webb), yet another suitor of Bianca's, he willingly accepts the challenge of attempting to make her his wife. I was a little bit surprised at how much of a comedy this film came off as. I knew it was one of Shakespeare's lighter works but felt as though the comedy was overdone a bit throughout the film. Some of the scenes were reminiscent of even slapstick comedy, they were so overdone. Perhaps it was this overtly comedic tone that the costuming was so dramatic. Irene Sharaff, Danilo Donati enjoyed Academy accolades being nominated for Best Costume Design and certainly deserve the recognition given the intricacies of the period pieces used in the film. Praise being given, however, Richard Burton's arms often looked like piñatas on-screen in his overly elaborate costumes. The Taming of the Shrew was a fun film, with an exceptionally acted, albeit sexist, finale involving Elizabeth Taylor. Certainly the most glowing part of The Taming of the Shrew was the acting of Richard Burton. I was expecting to be blown away by Elizabeth Taylor only for her to be overshadowed by Richard Burton every scene they shared. It is quite apparent that Richard Burton was no stranger to Shakespearean roles before his turn in The Taming of the Shrew, as his acting was simply phenomenal. I would be outraged at his not being recognized by the Academy for his Petruchio, had 1968 not been one of the most stacked years for Best Lead Actor that I have ever seen. In addition to Burton's fine acting, the ensemble cast added immensely to the film as well, each having their turn in the spotlight. The lighting in this film also adds a great deal to the plot. First showing Katharina in dark lighting, later to show her in brighter lighting is an apt allusion to her losing her Shrew moniker and becoming a noble wife. The expectations of women in this film make me glad to have not lived in Shakespeare's time. Once a woman became a wife, full obedience to her husband was expected, and one was scolded if this obedience was not given freely. Each piece of this film, the acting, lighting, and costuming work in harmony to forward progress the thematic content of the film creating one of my favorite Shakespeare adaptations I've seen to date. "},{"Title":"A Romp of a Comedy!","Date":"27 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Shakespearean comedy has not always fared too well on film, and there are far fewer successful film versions of these than there are of the tragedies and other dramas. But there are one or two that do stand out and The Taming of the Shrew belongs to this select group. I think there are several reasons for this the casting -which is magnificent and inspired; the acting -which balances just on the edge of over-the-top without succumbing to out-and- out farce; the pace -which is boisterous and bonny; and the profusion of little touches and details of scene, direction and picture. It is like a series of rather fine paintings from the Renaissance that are brought before us and taken away just as we start to think a little deeper about what is being shown. Here, as in most good comedy, we are never allowed to dwell too long before the next chapter unfolds. Zeffirelli's vision for this film is very theatrical, almost operatic, and he sees it through, so that it is a well-rounded whole; it's certainly beautifully designed and fascinating to look at. I quite understand why the choice was made to focus on the main story of Petruchio and Katharina (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor are terrific together), though purists may claim their histrionics flourish at the expense of the sub-plot, which is more heavily cut compared to its place in the original play.In Shakespeare's play much of the business involving the wooing of Bianca contains references that are less accessible to modern audiences than they would be to those watching in the 1590s. But I think quite enough is kept to retain the gist and thrust of the scheming. Bianca as a character does remain rather bland though, as indeed she does in the play. The film does away with the framing device &#x96;the Induction that Shakespeare used in his play, so here there is no opening scene in England with Christopher Sly and thus what we are shown is presented as real and not as a play being presented to this drunken character. Many stage productions do away with this frame device too, and most people are probably unaware that it is even part of the original story.There are many fine and colourful performances here, right across the board, but more importantly the cast works particularly well as an ensemble, each actor embracing the communal spirit of the piece and firing off each other. I find Michael Hordern deliciously perfect as the distraught father of the two girls . His facial expressions speak a thousand words and I think he gives one of the finest performances of his career; as does Burton. And Elizabeth Taylor is just fantastic! Recommended.

It proved to be very popular when released, probably because it was meant to be fun and entertaining rather than dry and intellectual. One has to realize that William Shakespeare's plays were entertainment for the masses of his era.As for the story itself, some reviewers have complained that it is about a husband's brutality and submission of his wife. These critics seem to have missed the part where Kate is rude not only to strangers, but to her father as well-and cruel to her sister as well. Kate isn't intended to be a sympathetic character. Also, contrary to politically correct myth, men were not all-powerful and women weak and powerless even in ancient times, as many tales from ancient and more recent times have indicated. And Petruchio did marry Kate for money-but he realized he would have to live with the woman he married. The ending of the movie suggested that Kate did not necessarily end up such a submissive slave after all.

That said, I can't say that I found the physical sparring between Petruchio and Kate funny, though the verbal sparring was often hilarious. The most notable omission from the film is the Christopher Sly frame story, which is a shame as the henpecked drunk serves as a great contrast to Petruchio.An accomplished Shakespearean actor who had previously played Hamlet on Broadway, Richard Burton is excellent as Petruchio, putting his excellent voice and beautiful accent to great use. In stark contrast to her then husband, Liz Taylor had never performed Shakespeare before but she does very well with the material and, as always, they had great on screen and, in this case, particularly intense chemistry. Burton and Taylor were of course famous for two tempestuous marriages so perhaps they could relate to the characters more than other actors would have! The supporting cast is generally very strong, particularly Michael Hordern as Kate's father Baptista, Cyril Cusack as Grumio, Michael York as Lucentio (in his first major film appearance), Alfred Lynch as Tranio and Vernon Dobtcheff as the Pedant. On the negative side, Alan Webb and Victor Spinetti are very over the top as Gremio and Hortensio respectively but neither of them play a big role.The crux of the play is Kate's speech in the final scene in which she says thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, thy head, thy sovereign and the way in which it is interpreted consequently determines the message of the relevant adaptation. The most common interpretations are either that Petruchio has successfully tamed Kate or that she is deceiving him into thinking that he has done so. Liz Taylor's delivery of the speech suggests that Kate is being sincere. However, the fact that she runs away laughing immediately afterwards belies this so I assume that the message that the screenwriters were trying to convey was that a strong man can be controlled by an even stronger woman without him realising it.Overall, this is an outrageously fun and extremely good adaptation which is very well directed by Franco Zeffirelli in his film debut. However, it is on nowhere near the same level as his version of Romeo and Juliet released the following year. As in that film though, the sets, costumes and locations are fantastic.

Also hearing that this film was a Zeffirelli production, I came to film with mixed expectations. Not exactly knowing much about The Taming of the Shrew as written by William Shakespeare, although I knew enough about Shakespeare himself, and seeing as he wrote it as a comedy, I thought i'd go see it. As the music started, the lush matte paintings faded in, some of the first lines spoken, I found myself pleased with the language. The individual lines themselves were pleasant and pleasantly executed, I loved the costume design and the sets, the parades and the playful scenes were fun, but, by the end, not so fun.For all its qualities, by the end the writing kind of caved in for me. Of course, certain aspects were appealing, but the whole thing itself has only 3 big appeals. Elizabeth Taylor being the first, we must all admit. Her part was nice, she looked nice, that British undertone in her voice really brings her out, and playing herself as a curst shrew, as it were, her role brings out that sort of tense undertone under the scenes in the comedy when she lashes out and makes a fuss. Richard Burton is the second biggest appeal, himself being one of my favorite actors, I absolutely love that semi-low voice, his specific enunciation in every syllable, his performances always enchant me. You bring them together in a Shakespearean comedy, place the man Zeffirelli in charge, give him a slice of Italy and a comedy by Shakespeare, and it all sounds at least a little interesting.The third biggest appeal is the language. Exhibited by the actors (and they're great actors, they make the lines great), the archaic terminology, the words are a joy to experience, that kind of quirkiness is refreshing, if you'd like to see this movie for the language, I strongly recommend you see it.Of all the good things I got from the film, there was one very unfortunately bad thing. One big, bad thing. Abridgment. Such brash and violate abridgment seemed to follow Taylor at a particular period in her career, one example being Cat On a Hot Tin Roof. The playwright Tennessee Williams himself was expressly offended and disgusted by the way his play was altered. Another such incidence with Elizabeth Taylor and abridgment was Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Of course, that might be an exception, since the transition from stage to screen required at least some toning down from the original play, and even after it was toned down, the film version was still pretty weighted.And I absolutely did not like the ending. At some point in at least any partly good film a central character needs to change or come across the chance to change. Petruchio does not come across any such chance. At the end he makes a bet against the other newlywed husbands as to whose wife would be more obedient. The entire basis of this bet for Petruchio is arrogant and unsavory. And worse, Katherine was the most obedient one. The speech Katherine delivered to the other wives was kind of sexist, I thought. Then again, it was a different time, and it only makes think of what Shakespeare thought of women. The arrogance remains in Petruchio throughout the entire film. He wins over Katherine, gets his money, wins the bet and delivers one of the most maddening and self-centered last lines I have ever heard in film, I won the battle you have yet to fight, and being the winner, God give you goodnight.

The exceptional acting in the film has been made by Elizabeth Taylor as Katharina and her second husband Richard Burton as Petruchio. It was a golden time for them too while acted together. The others were starred by Michael Hordern as Baptista, Natasha Pyne as Bianca and Michael York as Lucentio. It won an Academy Award for the set direction and costume design. Though it's a faithful version of the play, it had the subplot of Bianca missing plus the tinker which is not that important. It was produced by Franco Zeffirelli and MGM studios. This is the story about a hot-tempered but beautiful woman named Katharina who married to a wise noble named Petruchio. According to the director, this film is based on how Katharina rediscovers herself from a hot-tempered woman to a gentle lady that her husband transformed her to. The costumes are authentic as expected in Shakespeare's time. It was set in Italy as told in the play but it was shot under the studio. This version inspired most people that some other directors can make a contemporary version based on the same. Elizabeth Taylor as in real life didn't do any of the Shakespearean films before as this film is her first role in the Shakespeare play. She looked stunning in her costume but was also exceptional as she showed her 'tamed side' after meeting Petruchio who also done justice to his role. The atmosphere almost adjusts the play due to the dialogue was written. Some dialogues were replaced to help the contemporary audiences to understand the Shakespearean language. Burton made an exceptional acting rather than Taylor but the chemistry was superb as I think. The comedy was worth laughing due to its content. Michael Hordern was not there much but he gave an active role as a father which was worth laughing. The climax shows the message where both the play and the films tried to represent. The message of the film was shown by running its plot but it sometimes dragged that we become bored and miss the subplot of Bianca but foreshadowed by its comedy. Natasha played a cute Bianca but a cat-like expression that wowed the audience. The development of the characters was not perfect except for Baptista, Katharina, Bianca and Petruchio's acting. Overall, the story and its screenplay were authentic but the acting was mind-blowing, as I think. As people say 'Old-is-Gold', yes it is true that the 'real' movies ruled the 60s. It was such an era that anyone cannot forget where educative films were made with a little entertainment.

This production feels more earthy with its muddy streets and overdressed characters, unlike the later film, which feels romantic and almost ethereal. This approach works best for such a bawdy, vulgar comedy, filled with witty repartee, innuendo, and slapstick.Richard Burton is oafish, rambunctious, and a little sexy as Pertruchio, but it's Elizabeth Taylor who steals the whole film as the titular shrew. Despite never having been involved in a Shakespeare production on stage or in front of a camera, she delivers the verse well and gives Katherina an inner fire which never dies, even after she is supposedly tamed by Pertruchio. Her delivery of the controversial speech in the final scene is filled with irony. Though she seems to be extolling a wife's total subservience to her spouse, it's obvious she is only playacting for the public and her marriage will be more equal than Petruchio realizes.A good adaptation, especially for those who prefer traditionally staged Shakespeare to more modern re-imaginings. "},{"Title":"Chemistry is key","Date":"18 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Often overshadowed by his most famous of love stories (Romeo and Juliet), there is no denying, in this most flamboyant creation of a dramatic comedy and romance, Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew is in comparison, highly unknown and unrecognized to the common world of today. However, in saying this, there is also one place where this story is indeed recognisable in many shapes and forms. Though it may not possess the same marketing value as that of Verona's famous pair of star crossed lovers, The Taming of the Shrew has always had an unusual popularity in the world of film. So much that it was this story to be the first put to the screen with sound and dialogue by Sam Taylor in 1929, which made it the first Shakespearian play adapted to film with the actual use of the language. Yet while Taylor's attempts are certainly admirable, there is simply no competing with a Franco Zefferelli production of Shakespeare. In true Zefferelli fashion, his 1967 adaptation is visually spectacular, and from the very first few minutes in, you are immediately captivated by the buoyant spirit and energy present within the streets of our fair Padua. Though Zefferelli is not completely faithful to the original script, it is barely noticeable and easily forgiven as he still remains so wonderfully loyal to the story in many other important ways. For example, through the use of exuberant music and bright costume, Zefferelli manages to intensify the vibrancy of the comical atmosphere as well as the contrasting character personalities. However, the most intensifying aspect to the film in itself is most definitely the acting. There is a clumsy and awkward unpredictability in the energy of the crowds that gather throughout the film. But this is also present in the behaviour of central characters, and there seems to be conflict almost everywhere. Even the little children who carry the train of Kate's wedding dress are fighting. Though this does give it a sort of pantomime feel at times, I believe Zefferelli's intention was to keep the arguments amusing rather than actually violent. Therefore, he chooses to tackle the destructive nature of the play in a way that is true to the story but still entertaining for the audience. A story so renowned for its daring and rambunctious nature, The Taming of the Shrew is truly unique to its time and setting. With a love/hate relationship present between our two central characters (who often seem more prone to violence than anything else) Shakespeare does extremely well in challenging the typical preconceptions of love and marriage between man and woman of the time. Therefore, in order to successfully give us the right balance of this vicious yet amusing relationship on screen, the director's most important task lies in finding the actors who are capable. This is something of which I believe Zefferelli succeeds in more than anyone. With his risky and bold decision in casting a couple almost as notoriously wild as their characters, Zefferelli like others before him, deemed only a real life marriage worthy enough to possess the experience and knowledge needed in order to truly do the relationship justice. The difference was that this couple excelled. The legendary Richard Burton with his long career of Shakespearean drama was the perfect fit as our tamer Petruchio. Although his then wife Elizabeth Taylor was not the most ideal choice as Kate, (with no previous experience of Shakespeare,) it was not her reputation as an actress that landed her the role of the shrew, but her reputation as a tenacious wife. I must admit, as a massive fan of Taylor, I found myself trying extremely hard not to be bias in judging her performance as Kate. Although it wasn't exactly an Oscar winning performance, especially in comparison to Burton as Petruchio, I found Taylor's efforts as Kate truly commendable. Especially after having to bare the close to mute version of her played by Mary Pickford in 1929, I found myself almost grateful for the over dramatic moments given by Taylor. There's no denying that overall Burton was the ultimate star, but I believe that without Taylor as his fiery Kate, the film could have never reached its full potential. This was primarily the reason why Zefferelli took the risk of casting an amateur like Taylor in the first place. He knew that without an independent woman who was just as capable of handling Burton, as Kate is in handling Petruchio, the film would fall flat. And so he bases his decision on the chemistry of the actors rather than the ability to act, as they are truly believable on screen and everything is very natural between them. For example when you see a furious Kate giving Petruchio that signature scowl from across the room, you cannot help but feel like they have exchanged this look a thousand times before. Overall, I found Zefferelli's 1967 adaptation of the Taming of the Shrew truly enjoyable. While the imaginative costume, music and architecture is signature to a Zefferelli creation, it was the rustling and energetic atmosphere of Padua so exceptionally represented that had me immediately enthusiastic from the very beginning. I also found myself extremely grateful for the length of the film, as the 1929 version disappointingly, just ran over an hour long. Though he will always be criticized by some for his decision to not stick to the original script, I believe that Zefferelli was faithful to Shakespeare in all of the important ways. His efforts in paying enough attention to the main characters were his greatest success. As he had learnt from Sam Taylor's mistakes before him in 1929, how that passion and chemistry could very well easily be the determining factor to the films ultimate rise or fall.

While I've never been known for my feminist principles even I was aggravated by the outdated plot of Shakespeare's battle of the sexes comedy. Though produced in a period where women's rights were finally garnering attention, Zeffirelli's adaptation remains mostly oblivious to this fact. With the main gag being domestic violence this film was never going to be a smooth ride for Zeffirelli, yet he treats this issue with the delicacy of a troop of stampeding elephants.So here's the story Kate (Elizabeth Taylor), a woman with some firepower -okay a LOT of firepower- is too hot for the men of Padua to handle. No big deal, right? Wrong! Until Kate is married off, her sister Bianca must remain single (shock horror!) much to the annoyance of her various suitors. First world problems, eh? Luckily, Petruchio (Richard Burton) a booze-loving, money-grabbing brute comes to town to 'thrive and wive', and that he does, Kate being his chosen victim . . . ahem . . . partner.The first scene of Kate and Petruchio together just goes to prove that when Zeffirelli is good he's good. He captures the brilliant wittiness, the sexual tension, the hint that these two could actually be good together. Sparks fly- along with the furniture. Never mind if Petruchio's flirting is practically sexual harassment-this exchange is an enthralling meeting of minds! Kate certainly gives as good as she gets and is a joy to behold in all her sharp-tongued glory. Yes indeed, things look very promising for Zeffirelli.However, we want serious conflict, drama, obstacles and boy does Petruchio deliver! Cue violence, torture and starvation. Be warned, this is no harmless S & M to spice up the honeymoon, this is Petruchio's disturbing 'taming' process. Naturally this taming concept is challenging to make funny thus the film promptly nosedives. Zeffirelli cannot skilfully navigate the abrupt change in direction. He attempts to continue the bawdy and boisterous tone of previous scenes and this is his downfall. Shockingly, domestic abuse humour just doesn't sit with a modern audience. Let the bra- burning commence!Unfortunately,one of the biggest lures of the film turns out to be one of its biggest turn-offs; Burton as Petruchio. He fails miserably in his misguided attempt to make Petruchio the lovable rogue. Burton's interpretation is no more than an abusive, drunken lout. Whether he actually falls for Kate is irrelevant because he is cruel and revels in her suffering. The taming is a source of entertainment for him which makes his treatment of his wife all the more derogatory and humiliating.Combined with his constant alcohol consumption and 'heh heh heh' chuckle (which is a form of torture in itself) he makes for a despicable and extremely irritating character.Despite the problematic domestic abuse Zeffirellli does create some much needed comedy thanks to the eccentric Hortensio (Victor Spinetti) who wears enough makeup to put Maybelline out of business. Rejoice some gender equality at last! His camp mannerisms and ridiculous high-jinks add light to an often disturbing tale. His general cluelessness makes him an endearing character, so much so that a What Hortensio Did Next spin-off would be greatly appreciated. Hilarious facial expressions and slap-stick humour make him quiet the scene stealer and his ingenious disguise (fake beard and glasses) as he woos Bianca is so bad that it is in fact pretty good. Undoubtedly, Hortensio provides a fun alternative to the overbearing Petruchio.Other highlights include the sumptuous set designs and costumes, particularly Katherine's stunning wedding dress. Certainly this is a visually beautiful film, it's just a shame the other elements didn't come together so seamlessly. Also, Taylor gives a powerhouse performance, executing Kate's infamous speech with great dignity and poise despite stomach-churning lines like 'Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper'. Indeed it's a relief to finally see her get the better of her husband when she speedily disappears after their kiss. Yet, strangely in spite of Kate's small triumph during the ambiguous finale the film's overall vision still seems to mock women's rights just as they were coming to the forefront of society.Shakespeare's play provides the perfect platform to make a statement supporting female independence yet Zeffirelli wastes the opportunity, reducing his adaptation to a sketch on physical and mental domestic violence. Considering the film's questionable tagline 'A motion picture for every man who ever gave the back of his hand to his beloved ... and for every woman who deserved it' it seems deliberately misogynistic rather than a lack of skill on Zeffirelli's part, especially given the brilliance of his 1968 Romeo and Juliet.With adaptations as awkward as this, it's no wonder The Taming of the Shrew remains one of the Bard's lesser loved works. Indeed, I never thought I'd see the day when a nineties teen flick was more female empowering than a supposed classic but you'd be better off watching 10 Things I Hate About You (with the added bonus of Joseph Gordon-Levitt!) as Zeffirelli simply doesn't do The Taming of the Shrew justice. Tabloid followers and Taylor-Burton fans will enjoy the antics but for anyone else avoid it like a playhouse in the plague!

Costumes Design and Art Direction attained Academy nominations, although the film did not receive any. The score written by Nino Rota is characteristic of the the Late Middle Ages when the motion picture is set. Scenes from the original text are gathered around Padua, Italy, and surrounding countryside, which are pleasantly reflected as this project was recorded in Dino De Laurentiis Cinematografica Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy.This is William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew according to the introduction credits, in comparison to Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet. We are left wondering about the machine which is operating behind this movie as it has its star actors in Burton and Taylor and its fanciful title William Shakespeare's... but when reflecting on the original text you will be led to confusion; is this movie based on the induction or the latter part of the play? Shakespeare makes it perfectly clear which end we are receiving. If it is a mash in which Burton plays more to a Christopher Sly than a Petruchio, then it is not William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, it is Burton-Zeffirelli's...Ten minutes are spent in the initial taming. Petruchio takes off his sword, rolls up his sleeves and after some chasing, bantering, threats of physical violence, and swinging Katharina is silenced and hurt to a limp as she is dragged by her suitor to be paraded in front of her father and his guests. There is far more action in the motion picture than in the original text where the banter flows mentioning animals such as an ass, a turtle, a wasp, a crab, and domestic fowl, as well as flowers! (This film loves flowers.)Burton-Zeffirelli decided to cut the inductions found in the original Shakespeare text from the beginning of this feature film, although they included some reference to the induction. Early in the movie we receive the image of a religious drama on-stage playing to the drama within a drama concept. This is followed by a man in a wig and what seems to be a man dressed as a woman, the second man is carried off in a parade on a death bed, is this the boy dressed as the wife of Christopher Sly? And how does that relate to Petruchio who is presented as a drunk in this film. Maybe Burton only read the first few pages of the original text... Soon after we meet our hero, the drunk, Hortensio (Victor Spinetti) lays the plan of the marriage of Kate to Petruchio. After the conversation Petruchio is so drunk he is unable to undress for bed. The most striking reminder of the induction is the next morning where what is described in these lines occursLet one attend him with a silver basin Full of rosewater and bestrewed with flowers, Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,Act I line 57-59 William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew)Burton plays a Petruchio who often chuckles to himself funnily and we are convinced by his taming of Katharina who is driven off to his country home for some more taming. Unfortunately this Shakespeare adaptation was undone by Elizabeth Taylor's Disney-style acting, she was unable to aspire to the standard presented by Burton, York, Pyne and most members of the acting unit involved in this Burton-Zeffirelli production.It is chilling how inapt Taylor's acting can be. She has two emotions throughout the entire movie. Her emotions which are expressed through her throwing things and not throwing things and her voice which is pure monotone and varies between angry and placid. Take the scene just as Petruchio arrives at Baptista's home for the first time. Taylor chases Pyne who screams in a multitude of ways while Taylor throws out her lines in her monophonic fashion.If she has only two emotions Taylor's face knows only two expressions of wide-eyed and squint-eyed. If it were called Burton-Zeffirelli's The Squinting of the Shrew it would delve a fitter example of the quality of acting presented to the amateur and Shakespearean audience alike. When Taylor first appears on screen peeking out from between the shutters of her father's house she exhibits this wide-eyed to squint- eyed and vice versa look. Every time she appears she maintains the on-screen presence of a spoiled 2D Disney princess. Over-acting might be the term to insert here or over-compensating for not being an actual Shakespearean actor. However Taylor did win two Oscars during her lifetime for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Who are we to judge?

I remember my housemate come in and was appalled at one of the scenes in which Richard Burton held Liz Taylor down and commented that such a scene would not be accepted in today's world. For me, it was Katerina's final speech that outraged me, and then the more I thought about the play, the more outraged I became at a play that on its surface, treats women like dirt. Granted, the concept of selling one's daughter to the highest bidder is something that still occurs today in some cultures, but it is the status of women in this play that outraged me.Let us consider it for a minute. The entire play is about how a man, Petruchio (played by Richard Burton) psychologically beats a woman, Katerina (played by Elizabeth Taylor) into submission. What is strange though is that many of the people that I spoke to about this either laughed and said that it is Shakespeare, or berated me for taking 21st century thought into a 16th century play. However, a little research (read wikipedia) suggested that the play was quite controversial even in Shakespeare's time, and a further play, The Tamer Tamed, was written a little later in which the tables are turned on Petruccio.However, there is still my position on the play, and on the film. The film is very good, and treats the play in a way that many people treat it, and that is as a farce. In another sense, what we can be seeing is social criticism, Shakespearian style. However that still begs the question of whether Shakespeare is a misogynist. I don't think so. Some of his women are very strong characters, as well as being very respectable, and very eloquent (read Miranda, one of the most beautiful of Shakespeares' characters, in my opinion). Then there is Titania, she is very much an iron lady. Further, we need to consider the context in which it was written. There was a woman on the throne of England, who succeeded another very brutal and bloody woman (by which she earned the moniker, Bloody Mary).In my opinion, the jury is still out on this play, and I will be returning to it once I have read it. However it is interesting to note that even Germaine Greer liked the play and wrote highly of both Petruccio and Katerina (though she probably did read a bit too much into it - but then again, so have I).

The 1967 film version of this play directed by Franco Zeffirelli is one that captures many similarities and differences between this film and Shakespeare's original play text. This film is set in Italy and is based around the marriage of two sisters who come from a wealthy family. Their father declares that until his eldest daughter Katharina is wed he shall not allow any man to pursue his younger daughter Bianca. Katharina's character in this film is very similar to Shakespeare's original portrayal of her, she is fiery, sharp tongued and ill-tempered just as she is in Shakespeare's original play text. In contrast to Katharina is her sister Bianca, Bianca is portrayed as a perfect and obedient character in this film as well as in Shakespeare's original text, however over the course of the film the characters of Katharina and Bianca develop and they change into completely different people to who they were at the beginning of the film and this is another similarity these characters have with the original text of the play. The character of Petruchio is represented in the same manner in which Shakespeare had originally portrayed him. Petruchio is driven by money in this film as he was in the original play text and he loves the idea of taming his shrewish wife Katharina. Zeffirelli makes multiple references to this element of his character for example he dangles things in front of her that she wants and establishes that he will decide if she gets them or not. There are many similarities between this film and the original play text however there are also some significant differences, for example Zeffirelli excludes the opening scene of the play from the film. This doesn't impact the film too greatly though even if we don't know it's a play within a play, as elements of this first scene in the play are seen in the first scene of the film as there is the drunkard tied up in the cage which may represent Cristopher Sly.Another difference between Zeffirelli's film version of this text and the actual play text itself is the comedy that is present throughout the entirety of this film. There are plenty of examples in the film of where comedic references are present one example is at both wedding scenes and both are by instigated by Petruchio, another example is when Petruchio is chasing Katharina around her house, another example is in the scene with Lucentios father just before the wedding. Petruchio seems to be at the heart of most of the comedic scenes in this film which makes him differ from Shakespeare's original portrayal of him in the play text. Zeffirelli's choice in casting for this film was spot on again as Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are outstanding playing the characters of Katharina and Petruchio. There is undeniable chemistry between the two of them and as the film draws to a close this becomes more and more noticeable. Zeffirelli also does an exceptional job of capturing the colour and comedy present at the time in Italy. The costumes for one were outstanding and kept very much with the time capsule in which this play is set, the differences in the costumes of ordinary daily life to the ones at the wedding is captured with phenomenal detail in this film and Zeffirelli does an exceptional job in showing the differences between the two. The differences in costume between a poor woman and a wealthier woman are also present throughout this film as we see Katharina and Bianca in much more luxurious dresses than the less well-off women in this film. The comedic references that are made throughout this film are extremely precise within which time this play was set, for example in the very opening scene when there are people making fun of the drunkard. All in all I believe Zeffirelli's adaptation of The Taming of The Shrew by William Shakespeare is outstanding as he focuses on the little details such as the traits in which the characters present throughout the film, the development of Katharina's character, the comedic references throughout the film, the casting choices and the costume design. "},{"Title":"Film Review The Taming of the Shrew (1967)","Date":"4 November 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Film Review The Taming of the Shrew (1967)My film review is on the 1967 version of The Taming of the Shrew directed by Franco Zeffirelli. It is a film based on the very popular novel by William Shakespeare. The story is set in the Italian city of Padua and is about a father who wants to wed off his older, vicious, wild daughter before anyone can marry his younger, sweeter and prettier daughter. It is quite a humorous film and I think Zeffirelli picked the cast very well and they suited their characters. Elizabeth Taylor who plays Katharina plays her character very well; at the start of the film she is a loud, scary, violent person who acts crazy. She fights with her sister and father constantly and refuses to get married, she has wild black hair and very colourful clothes and she is very strong, independent character. However at the end of the film she is completely different after being tamed. She is quiet and respectful to her husband. She agrees to whatever he has to say and does what he tells her to do. Her hair is pulled back off her face and neat. Bianca, Katharina's sister is played by Natasha Pyne is a completely different character to Katharina. She is quiet and polite. Bianca is smaller, prettier and sweeter than Katharina. You can really tell the difference in the two of them in the film even by what they are wearing. Bianca wears pale, pretty dresses and has her hair always done nicely, whereas Katharina wears colourful crazy dresses and her hair is always messy until she met Petruchio. The costumes in The Taming of The Shrew are very colourful and old fashioned. They wear long, puffy, colourful dresses like what they wore in the 1600's. The men then wore massive woolly jackets and tight trousers. Both men and woman also wore big head pieces. Men wore hats and sometimes a few feathers on it and woman wore very expensive looking head pieces especially to occasions like weddings which we see a lot of in The Taming of The Shrew. The setting of the film is also old style; they live in massive old castles. In the scene when Petruchio chases Katharina we see a lot of the house and the barn or storage area, there was onions hanging all around it from the ceiling, big blocks of cheese and a massive area for storing sheep's wool which shows how well off Katharina's family were to have so much sheep wool which would have been very expensive back then. I think The Taming of The Shrew is quiet a humorous film. There are some funny parts throughout it like when Petruchio is at Katharina's house ringing the door bell and Katharina gets so frustrated that she pulls the doorbell off and breaks it and slams the door in Petruchio's face. This scene shows how angry Katharina is and how violent she is but is also witty. Another funny scene is at the very end when Petruchio sends his servant to command Katharina to come into him. As the servant is walking out the door he blesses himself because he thinks Katharina is going to attack him for telling her what to do and feels like he won't make it out alive. I think one of the main scenes in The Taming of The Shrew is when Petruchio and Katharine are heading back to Padua to Katharine's father and Petruchio tells her that the sun is the moon and she agrees with him he then says that it is the sun and she agrees with him again. She is completely controlled by Petruchio and is now tamed. She would never disobey him like she would before they got married, she is completely different person. Another major scene in this film where it shows Katharine completely different is at the very end when each man calls in their wives to the ball room, none of their wives would come out to them apart from Katharine. Who was the last person everyone thought would come out. This also shows how much Petruchio controls her. I really liked this film. I thought it was really interesting and funny at parts. Franco Zeffierlli also directed the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet and I much prefer his version of The Taming of The Shrew. I think I might like it better because I feel there are so many different versions of Romeo and Juliet and I've studied it so many times whereas this was my first time studying The Taming of the Shrew so it was all new to me. I also loved the costumes and the characters in this film, especially Katharina.

Zeffirelli's choice of cast suited the characters very well especially Elizabeth Taylor as Katharina and Richard Burton as Petruchio. These two fiery protagonists added excitement and action to this adaption of Taming of the Shrew. Zeffirelli added a great variety of music throughout the play by Nino Rota, also his choice of costumes allowed the audience to visualize back to the 1500s and get into the setting of the play. All of the characters are dressed in puffy, frilly and extravagant costumes in each scene throughout the play. This play is set in a small merchant village in Padua, where we meet a rich merchant called Baptista played by Michael Hordern, he is the father of the fiery shrew Katharina and the sweet, innocent Bianca (Natasha Pyne). Baptista is against his youngest daughter Bianca getting married until his oldest daughter Katharina is wed which he and the whole village think will never happen as she is referred to as a 'hot- tempered shrew'. It is clear Baptista treats his daughters very differently, he shows affection to Bianca with kisses and hugs, and it is clear he is afraid of Katharina as he tries to avoid her and stay out of her way. We see Baptista is only interested in money and not the happiness of his daughters as he agrees to let Petruchio, an arrogant, violent man marry Katharina. Katharina is a very fiery character in this play but because she has a temper and cannot control her anger her feelings are not considered by her father as he marries her off. Bianca is a very different character to Katharina; she seems to be 'daddy's girl' in this play, even Katharina agrees as she states to her father 'She is your treasure'. Bianca comes across as spoilt in the play as she has her own music tutor at their house. Lucentio is a student and the son of a wealthy merchant who poses as a tutor to gain access into the Baptista household and to get closer to Bianca. As the relationship between these two characters blossom it is clear they are in love with each other unlike Katharina and Petruchio who cringes at the thought of having to kiss him. In this adaption of Taming of the Shrew Zeffirelli does not focus much on the relationship between Bianca and Lucentio he makes it more about Petruchio trying to tame Katharina. In the film there is a very action packed scene between Petruchio and Katharina as he tries to 'woo' her and she attempts everything to get away from him. She tells him 'I would rather die than marry you'. One of his techniques to tame Katharina was locking her in her room for days until their wedding day. In the wedding scene Petruchio's choice of wedding attire is very controversial among the village he does this to show he is the dominant one in the relationship and he also does this to embarrass his bride to be. After the ceremony he rudely whisks her away from her family to his house outside of the city. She got no say on who she got marries to unlike Bianca. Bianca is allowed to marry the love of her life Lucentio as he is wealthy, Petruchio is allowed to marry Katharina as he was looking for a wealthy wife and Hortensio and another suitor of Bianca agreed to cover the costs for him as he tries to tame the 'shrew'. In the final scene there is a change in Katharina's personality, she comes across as happy for Bianca there is a moment when you think has Petruchio tamed her? After she wins the wager for him and lectures the other women on how they should obey their husbands at all times, Petruchio thinks he has finally tamed her. But she is trying to show that women can control men by pretending to obey them as she slyly exits unknown by Petruchio he is made chase after her. Showing she has not been tamed at all she is the same Katharina she has learn to outsmart Petruchio. "},{"Title":"Well Done Zeffirelli, Burton, and Taylor. Well done.","Date":"1 November 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Of all of Shakespeare's comedies, the least funny is The Taming of the Shrew. It may have been a hit back in Shakespeare's day, however, in modern times most of the jokes are lost. When reading the play, we can romanticize the play to our fluttering heart's content. When faced with the slightly more concreteness of a film, we cannot escape the actions of the characters. One of the best film adaptations of The Taming of the Shrew was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1967. The set and costumes were historically accurate, a rare thing to see with Shakespeare on film. Zeffirelli follows very closely to what Shakespeare wrote. Far more impressive than the costumes, the set, and the script, is the casting choices. Richard Burton plays a very convincing Petruchio with just the right amount of a arrogance mixed with enough soft and caring glances to make us want to like him. Yes, his reason for wanting to marry Katharina is purely for monetary purposes. Yes, he does chase and flirt with Katharina in such a physical and dangerous way that they end up breaking the roof and injuring Katharina. Yes, he does lie about Katharina's consent to marry him. Yes, he does sabotage the wedding by dressing and acting ridiculously. Yes, he does treat with new wife in an appalling manner. But the soft and caring glances he sends to Katharina when she isn't looking just makes up for it in our love tinted glasses. Elizabeth Taylor goes farther as Katharina than many women dare to do with Shakespeare's female characters. At first glance, Katharina is a wild, raging, furious demon-like woman. She is physically abusing her sister Bianca, Natasha Pyne. She goes into fits of rage, throwing a breaking anything she can get her hands on. Taylor could have easily kept up that one level of Katharina through out the rest of the film, but she didn't. After Petruchio lies about her consenting to marry him, Katharina looks like she just might not completely hate getting married. She seems to like that Petruchio is not only showing an interest in her, but putting out the effort to compete with her and is actually looking forward to her wedding. Following the sabotaged wedding, that really can't count as a marriage because Katharina was in the middle of objecting when Petruchio kissed her and sealed the deal against her wishes, there is a power-play between Petruchio and Katharina that smells far from right. Petruchio only wins the power-play because he was louder and, in a caveman-esque manner, carried off Katharina. The family and wedding guests were by far the worst characters in the film, they simply watched as Petruchio made a mockery of the wedding and even laughed. When Petruchio carried Katharina away, instead of being concerned for Katharina's well being they joke and laugh. This film is perfect for showing what the play really is. Rather than a comedy of mistaken identity, disguises, and witty language battles the film shows the raw abuse that Katharina receives from Petruchio. Zeffirelli, Burton, and Taylor spend no time sugarcoating their actions. It was almost uncomfortable to watch as Petruchio teased Katharina with nice things only to deny her them. He wont let her eat, he wont let her sleep, he wont let her have a nice dress for her sisters wedding. The abuse is not hidden in any way. Petruchio is doing what the title suggests, he is taming shrew. He does this the same way one would tame a wild horse, by breaking it. The concept is barbaric and socially unacceptable today. However, this is not set in modern times and it was written when this kind of behavior was acceptable. Zeffirelli truly did an amazing job with such a controversial play.

Sometimes they disappoint, but every so often there is one, mainly forgotten, that resurfaces with the force of a revelation. One such that I had recently rather unenthusiastically acquired and put aside for a rainy day when I might be hard up for something to watch, was Zeffirelli's 1967 adaptation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Although surely tailor-made and type-cast for Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton at their most violently vitriolic, I hadn't remembered particularly liking it at the time. However, such was its effect a few day's ago that I couldn't wait to experience it again a few hours later. I suppose I must have become accustomed to the pleasure of those medieval costume romps of Pasolini such as The Decameron and The Canterbury Tales in the years since I first experienced Zeffirelli's foray into one of the Bard's most extravagant comedies. Anyway, The Taming of the Shrew is nothing but pure delight from its rainbow landscaped opening to the grand finale, a contest to find the most obedient wife. When two young travellers first arrive in Padua, they and us, the audience, are immediately drawn into the life of a city that always seems to be en fête with music (terrific stuff by Nino Rota) and gaiety. It appears a place devoid of medieval misery with only the odd drunkard in a cage swinging from the side of a building to remind of the fate that may befall a malcontent. For the rest almost everyone appears to be having a high old time, eating, drinking, revelling and dancing, with even the shrew, Katherina, exuberantly delighting in her bitchy rants in spite of being drenched in a muddy pool at one point or having food snatched from before her very open mouth. Elizabeth Taylor was never more voluptuously lovely than when she screamed her way through to eventual submission. As for Richard Burton, he was at his misogynistic best when taming such a beauty. But those many faces in the crowd are what stamp the film with so much joy and vitality. Was there ever a cast, from leading players right down to the most insignificant extra, that appeared to be enjoying themselves so much!

He, 42), as well as (2) Both of them being co-producers of this less-than-satisfying production.In my opinion, these 2, together, literally ground Shakespeare's 16th Century play right into the dirt without even giving it a fair chance to really breathe and come to life.Featuring lots of irksome scenery-chewing by Taylor (who, as usual, wore way too much mascara and eyebrow pencil) and plenty of pompous bellowing by Burton (who was nothing but an egocentric windbag), this 1967 costume comedy certainly did wonders for encouraging spousal abuse from both sides of the matrimonial bed.Taylor, as Katharine (the shrew), scored high points through verbal castration and the flat refusal of any sexual contact with her partner. While, on the other hand, Burton, as Petruchio (the tamer), did his best through humiliation tactics and the forced starvation of his mate.(My-oh-my, aren't these 2 just a wonderful pair?) Apparently, this $4 million production was a huge, box-office hit upon its initial, 1967 release. But, now, 47 years later, it sucks. Had this film's 2-hour running time been reduced by a good 30 minutes, then, yes, perhaps that might've helped matters, somewhat. "},{"Title":"Review","Date":"14 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Franco Zefferelli's adaption of William Shakespeare's classic play, The Taming of the Shrew, released in 1967 is one of the most effective Shakespeare adaptations of its time. Filled with celebrated actors, decadent costumes, and set against an opulent Italian backdrop, The Taming of the Shrew is a fast-paced and enchanting watch, infused with the classical comedic screenplay which made the original comedy-drama such a success. Zefferelli's adaptation stays true to the original play, whilst also receiving a more contemporary lift, making it an entertaining and enjoyable experience for all modern audiences. This attraction can certainly be partly credited to the casting of two renowned film stars, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the leading roles of Katherine and Petruchio. The casting of this particular couple who were actually married at the time allows them to bring their natural chemistry to the screen, adding a fiery disposition to their characters and making the principal relationship more authentic. In fact, the couple were described in the original trailer as playing, 'The motion picture they were made for...need we say more!' Indeed Taylor and Burton seem to intensely connect with their on-screen counterparts, the eccentric and passionate husband and wife. Taylor and Burton excel as the plays principal chaotic duo and for me, they were the major attraction of this adaptation. Taylor perfectly portrays Katherine's tempestuous nature, capturing the wildness of the Shrew so effectively that anyone who had formerly doubted Taylors potential to portray a leading Shakespearean lady were proved extraordinarily mistaken. Likewise Burton flawlessly depicts Petruchio as a self-absorbed and arrogant man, with the flair we have come to expect from the talented actor. Burtons Petruchio excellently emulates his wife's unruliness with his obscene expressions and constant state of inebriation. However, personally it was Taylor's performance in particular which captivated me. The adaptation for the most part stays true to the original plot, one crucial exception is that the traditional Induction is eliminated, commonplace for the majority of Shakespearean adaptations of the epoch. Some of the original subplot is omitted, such as the extent of attention on the relationship between Lucentio and Bianca, making room for more focus on the leading couple. The overall tempo of the film is fast paced, creating a dramatic and entertaining experience. The themes of male chauvinism, domestic violence and the repression of women are dealt with in such a comedic fashion it's easy to forget how harmful and prominent these issues actually are in contemporary society. Fortunately, Taylors Katharina appears to turn the tables on her Petruchio in the end, emphasizing the underlying control held by woman and giving a new edge to the apparently submissive character. The new domesticated Katharina who emerges in the end is ultimately proved to be deceptive by her exit, by cunningly pushing Petruchio to follow her and subjecting to him to scrutiny from his contemporaries. This pursuit is reminiscent of the chase which also occurs in their introduction. This portrays a power reversal which is contrasting to Shakespeare's conclusion and also slightly rebuffs the misogynistic overtone of the film making it evident who is really in charge. This slight alteration which shifts the balance of power is an appealing finale for the female audience. Overall the film retains its comedic aspect which makes it a humorous and enjoyable watch. Zefferelli shoots his exuberant motion picture against a picturesque Italian backdrop, certainly deserving of its two Academy Award nominations, Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction. The opulent costume design is reflective of the era, epitomizing the decadence of dress the 60's has come to be renowned for. The scenery is certainly inspirational, perhaps the sunny Italian atmosphere is intensified by the fact that Zefferelli himself is Italian which makes the environment more authentic, by having a native director who certainly knows what he is doing. These aspects are a key attraction to this version of The Taming of the Shrew, adding to and emphasizing the energy and fervour of the picture. On aspect of the film which was not so favourable and would have greatly added to its appeal had it been more successful was its score. Following the musical success of 'Kiss Me, Kate', which opened in London's West End in 1951, Nino Rota's musical composition feels slightly lacking in drama and excitement, a feature which did not escape the critics. Otherwise, The Taming of the Shrew was received to generally positive reviews from critics at the time of its release and it retains its timeless appeal even now.

This film was ideal for a related text comparison. We looked into the techniques and sub-related areas of the film and did a comparison to the original play by Shakespeare. Elizabeth Taylor and Burton portrayed the characters very well and gave our class an insight to the Elizabethan times. The lighting was sometimes hard on the eyes and the characters clothing and props were quite drab but for anyone debating on whether to watch the film i would say definitely because this is a great film with even better actors. Definitely great for a rainy afternoon in front of the telly. Good luck to all and blessed be.

That aside I love this film and she makes a reasonable job of Kate (and she was always stunning to look at).I love the way the whole thing looks and Burton is magnificent in spite of what the theatrical snobs (who never forgave him for leaving the theatre) say. WS is difficult to make a popular movie-going choice for most people and Zefferelli had the talent to do it. His Romeo and Juliet was exemplary too. Victor Spinetti and Michael Hordern were never better and it is a pleasure to see that talented actor Alfred Lynch as a young man in a great movie.Likewise Michael York. I love the music too and I recommend this as an introduction to the bard. Before you shoot me down, you purists should welcome the fact that the plays are sometimes rendered intelligible to the unwashed masses!! Shakespeare was never so precious as the literary set would have him be.

Any director who selects The Taming of the Shrew in the 20th (or 21st) Century has a problem. How to you deal with a play that is basically about spouse abuse? We all know the basic plot-- Katharina is a strong-minded woman, therefore a shrew. Petruchio marries her for her money, and then subjects her to physical and psychological torture. Ultimately, she breaks, and becomes the docile, subservient wife that Petruchio wants her to be.Some directors have chosen to tell us that Katharina isn't really broken. She has learned to manipulate Petruchio so he thinks he's the master, but she knows that this isn't true. (Mary Pickford famously gave the speech about man as master, but then she winked.)Not so here. Elizabeth Taylor as Katharina appears to really mean it when she says that the husband is the master. Richard Burton, as Petruchio, appears to really desire and accept Katharina's defeat. It's painful to watch. (We'll never know what Shakespeare really thought about this. But we know, it would seem, what Zeffirelli thought.)There's a second plot, involving Katharina's sister, Bianca, but Zeffirelli brushes this aside. It's actually a pretty funny and interesting plot, but you'd never know it from this film.What we get instead is lots of color. See Padua the way it looked in the Renaissance. The crowds, the prostitutes, the petty criminals. (Note to Zeffirelli--this is Shakespeare, not a travelogue.)Burton was handsome, Taylor was beautiful, and the movie was pretty bad. If you want to see a Taming of the Shrew, see the Pickford-Fairbanks version. Fairbanks was handsome, Pickford was beautiful, and the movie was pretty good.

I didn't get any sense of sexual tension between Burton and Taylor other than the fact that they were into year-X of their very public torrid romance. And, quite honestly, that's the only reason anybody went to go look at this thing, otherwise it's a so-so (some times ham-fisted) production with lots of A-list talent.I didn't like it a whole lot when I first saw it, but I can still appreciate the language on the screen, and bought it strictly for that. A reshoot with new actors, A-list talent who are non-Stars would be welcome. If you have a passing interest in Shakespeare then give it a shot, but don't be surprised if you find yourself yawning by the end of the movie.See it once.

Though accepted by his father to come, yet rejected by whose delicious, raging elder daughter Katherina. The proud gentleman appears to be after her but... will he woo the furious girl to bring a shrew from a wild cat to Kate? Can she ever come obedient wife to become? Indeed, a sophisticated task he appears to undertake until she finds her eyes mistaking...Shakespeare's magnificent comedy, THE TAMING OF THE SHREW, which is believed to have been written in the early 1590s, is built upon three major aspects, or to put it more clearly, pillars story, entertainment and wit. These three have been rarely respected or retained in various screen adaptations. Nevertheless, the one that deserves the name 'faithful' is this Burton-Zeffirelli co-production made more than 40 years ago. How is it? First of all, what we find here is a decent combination of dialogs and situations that altogether make for a wonderful comedy. The script in this film is, on the one hand, perfectly adapted to the requirements of viewers being, on the other hand, faithful to Shakespeare's idea. There is nothing verbatim but the text is executed naturally and there is no confusion of so called 'pompously dated interactions.' Moments that were supposed to make us laugh still amuse us to the equal extent. Just to note here the hilarious scenes of Petrucchio-Kate's 'battles'. At the same time, the movie is a terrific entertainment which does not purely rely on humor itself but primarily on the merits of THE TAMING OF THE SHREW as a movie only. Here, the key aspects referring directly to our concept of entertainment are performances, costumes, scenery and music...everything Zeffirelli proved to be excellent at in a number of later productions. Let me now broaden these aspects for the sake of a more detailed analysis.Casting the lead was a terrific choice. Although Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren had been considered earlier, Zeffirelli met Richard Burton in the USA where Burton agreed to undertake this project. After all these years, we can say without doubts that there would not have been any better choice than Burton and Taylor. What comes out is an unforgettable burst of chemistry combined with affection, rage and changeable emotions. Simply two raging fires meeting together in real life, in play and on screen... Burton wonderfully emphasizes Petrucchio's strong will and savage humor while Taylor focuses on Kate's change from a fury of a tiger into a softness of a lamb, from an independent maiden into an obedient wife. The supporting cast are also excellent, just to note young Michael York as Lucentio so much in love with cute Bianca (Natasha Pyne). Michael York later played in some of Zeffirelli's great films, but his role here is highly worth attention as genuine and convincing. Actors like Michael Horden, Vernon Dobtcheff make brilliantly for various details that appear to be significant, too.OTHER ARTISTIC MERITS Costumes by Danilo Donati, a mainstay of Zeffirelli's earliest films, are truly exquisite. Wardrobe together with marvelous scenery and studio sets for Padua leave a lasting impact in the viewer. One can say without hesitation Real visual feast beautifully photographed. Music by Nino Rota is, perhaps, not as good as it is in ROMEO AND JULIET filmed two years later (1968) but I also find it very entertaining and memorable. This rhythm and tune appear to be a combination of strong emotions and calmness. As a result, it is based upon contrast, change, specifically resembling all the story is about. Very good musical score!Considering the criticism of this movie, I would say, together with many people who find Zeffirelli's productions valuable and accurate, I cannot understand how someone may call this movie a 'destruction of Shakespeare'. What constructive arguments could be presented here as the reaction to such baseless viewpoints? The critical opinions about Zeffirelli are also based on strikingly illogical phrase too beautiful Should the director make ugly looking pictures?... Yet, my comment is, fortunately, not meant to become a dispute but rather an expression of my personal opinion and I can say proudly and openly Zeffirelli is my favorite director! But here, the movie was not and is not any Zeffirelli vehicle.THE TAMING OF THE SHREW is one of the most beautiful, overwhelming, memorable Shakespeare adaptations, a movie that is still going to amuse you, thrill you, entertain you, particularly when you keep your eyes open to art. 9/10 "},{"Title":"The Taming of the Shrew","Date":"21 April 2011","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I saw the musical comedy Kiss Me Kate and really liked it, and I was looking forward to seeing this more to the original version, especially following the tragic death of the leading actress, from director Franco Zeffirelli (Tea with Mussolini). Basically rich merchant Baptista (Michael Hordern) doesn't want his fair young daughter Bianca (Natasha Pyne) to be married until her older sister, hellish shrew Katharina (BAFTA nominated Dame Elizabeth Taylor) has wed. Son of a wealthy Pisan merchant, Lucentio (introducing Michael York), has fallen in love with Bianca, and poses as a music and poetry tutor to get close to her. From Verona to Padua comes fortune-hunting scoundrel Petruchio (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Richard Burton), is looking for a wealthy wife, and another suitor for Bianca, Hortensio (Victor Spinetti), directs him to Katharina. Hortensio does warn Petruchio about her fiery temper and sharp tongue, but he sees her as a good challenge to gain her love for him, and he has Gremio (Alan Webb), another suitor for Bianca, is paying costs to help win her round. I will be honest and say that I dozed off half way through, and a little towards the end, but I do know that Katharina did indeed fall in love with Petruchio and they did get married. Also starring Cyril Cusack as Grumio and Alfred Lynch as Tranio. When I did pay attention Taylor did give a really good performance as the hard to handle woman with attitude, and Burton is as good as the man trying to win her round. It being based on the work of William Shakespeare it is obviously hard to understand everything the characters are saying, but when I understood I enjoyed most of it, and I did find it funny in places, a likable comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. Very good!

However, Burton & Taylor removed all the comical elements to make it just plain drama probably to portray their own lives.Shakespeare wrote comedies where a great deal of the comedy is acted by minor characters in the stories. In this production, no minor characters were allowed to do that and the removal of all that comedy can only be attributed to Burton & Taylor being producers of the film. It appears that Burton & Taylor wanted to use this production to portray their own personal marriage travails, not to portray Shakespeare drama.The scene where Biondello brings the books for Baptista's daughters to study became very dry though Biondello is supposed to be comical in this scene. The scene where Petruchio gets clothes becomes dry because the Haberdasher is not allowed to react to Burton's comments.All this might be of small consequence if Burton & Taylor could act comedy themselves, but they can't. Neither Burton nor Taylor were capable of comedy. They are both fine dramatic actors, but not for comedy. They take their parts far too seriously to act comedy. Unless the actor is doing a monologue, comedy usually requires a working relationship between two actors. Burton & Taylor did not allow that relationship with the minor characters in this production, though they did attempt it between themselves. But they are far too serious in their dialogue to come off comically.For real Shakespeare comedy, see Much Ado About Nothing with Kenneth Branagh & Emma Thompson. Now that is real Shakespeare comedy. Be sure to observe the flippant dialogue & bantering between Benedick & Beatrice, as well as Dogberry's lines to the judge and the criminal's reactions when they are brought before the judge. This production of The Taming of the Shrew is a true disgrace to the spirit of William Shakespeare.

If you like filmed Shakespeare, you'll probably like this, because it's a fairly strong adaptation. I'm not a huge fan of Shakespeare films, so you won't get any sort of ringing endorsement from me, but that's not necessarily because of anything wrong with the way this material is presented.

It glorifies suppression of women in a disgusting manner. Initially, the relation between Petruchio (Richard Burton) and Katarina (Elizabeth Taylor) is like a cat playing with a mouse. After that it gets much, much worse and Katarina is constantly abused, at least mentally, throughout the rest of the movie. Her possibilities to control her own situation is soon reduced to nothing, and the tormentor (Petruchio) is hailed as a rightmost king of her world. It is hard to imagine that the human values and the view of a sound relation between man and wife, represented by this movie, were acceptable as late as the mid sixties when it was recorded. I watched this movie in true agony. It is by far the worst film I have ever seen. "}]
