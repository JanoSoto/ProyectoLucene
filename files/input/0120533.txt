[{"Title":"Not bad, not great either","Date":"14 November 2004","Score":"44 out of 55 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" The problem with Woody Allen is that he has made great films, a lot, and that expectations for his work are always high. With 'Celebrity' it was not different and therefore it is a little disappointing. If another writer director would have made this film I think I would have liked it better. Maybe that is strange, to compare it with his other films simply happens.In 'Celebrity' we follow Kenneth Branagh who plays Woody Allen, although he is named Lee Simon. A movie without Woody Allen himself is nice, but with a character that basically is Allen, why not play it yourself? On the other hand, Branagh does a terrific job. We see how Branagh divorces his wife and after that we have single episodes of his life where he meets women, tries to make them his, fails or succeeds, only to enter the next episode. At the same time we follow his ex-wife, Robin (Judy Davis), who meets a new man Tony (Joe Mantegna) and does settle.Branagh is a writer. He writes a novel, has written two novels with bad reviews and now he finished a screenplay. In the episodes he tries to offer his script or new novel to people who can change it into a movie or book. We have Melanie Griffith and Leonardo DiCaprio as spoiled actors, Famke Janssen as a girl who really likes him and could help get his story into a book, Winona Ryder as the girl he has some real chemistry with and Charlize Theron as a supermodel.The problem is that every episode feels like an episode instead of everything combined as a movie. The Theron and DiCaprio episodes are great, the Winona Ryder episode is sweet, the others are pretty standard. The intercuts of the ex-wife's life are pretty good as well, but still feel as single episodes.Although the film as a whole is not that great there are enough moments to enjoy it. You will not be bored. The black and white photography looks terrific and that is something that makes the movie more pleasant. It is well acted and of course directed, but for a Woody Allen comedy it is not my first choice.

The film is hilarious but deep--like his best films. It explores our obsession with celebrities and the media's obsession with them, and I wonder how much acting Leonardo DiCaprio did for this film. But the more I thought about it afterwards, the more I realized how sad the movie is at its core--the word help being written in the sky may be what Allen is thinking--is this what we have become? So obsessed with fortune and fame that we literally prostitute ourselves and become someone we aren't (i.e. Judy Davis' character)?The movie seems more timely now than in 1998.  Americans seem to be more interested in what Paris Hilton does on TV, or what J-Lo and Affleck are up to, than what's going on in the world.  Celebrity nails it, and like Deconstructing Harry, does it in a rather vulgar manner.  But you have to wonder how much of this is based on real events (again, I cite Di Caprio).  This was the second movie (after 2 Days in the Valley) that made me aware of the statuesque beauty of Charlize Theron.  I didn't think she could act worth a hoot (that opinion recently changed), but she sure looked like a rich runway model to me.   This movie is one of my favorite Woody films of the '90s, and one of his most underrated.  It's also visually beautiful, in black & white that recalls the photography of Manhattan.

It's much more subtle but every bit as scathing as Deconstructing Harry. Everyone says Woody's films just aggrandize himself, but I feel that his latest few have been exercises in self-loathing.Certain people (in these very pages) have felt that one is supposed to sympathize with the Branagh character. Certain people, we must remember, are on crack. Branagh plays a low-life louse who gives the word narcissim a whole new meaning. He is looking to revitalize his life by entering the world of celebrities. He is contrasted with his ex-wife (the always amazing Judy Davis... who doesn't she do more films?) who is also looking to change her life, but not necessarily by becoming famous. She does become famous, and near the end she says what I think is the key line I've become the kind of person I've always detested, but I'm happier. My friend and I had an argument later about what the film was saying a) that Judy has given up on seriousness and meaning by becoming a celebrity, but now she's happier, or b) that the entertainment products that these people turn out don't matter at all, and that if one can find personal happiness (Judy eventually becomes much more social and comfortable with people) by doing them, then that's great. I don't know, but this is a far more interesting treatise on finding happiness than the dreary Happiness was.This is also the funniest Allen film in years, with two total laugh-out-loud lines which I won't spoil here.Overall, I felt the celebrity part, and all the walk-ons we not at all the focus of this movie, it just uses that world as a backdrop. This film is also very sweet and real, with the scene in which Judy Davis visits a psychic being one of the most intimate and touching I've seen.One last thing, it's fun to see a Woody Allen film in New York City, because you can watch the audience trying to identify all the places where the scenes are set.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies www.cinemademerde.com "},{"Title":"Branagh is not Woody","Date":"17 May 2008","Score":"16 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" One of the most brilliant Woody Allen's 90s' pictures, such a mockery of the beautiful people with some traces of a romantic comedy and some reflexions about couple troubles made in Woody.

But what has he done instead?  He has simply cast Kenneth Branagh in his place as a somewhat younger and more handsome substitute,  but one who is, alas, no less frumpy, neurotic, unaccomplished and ultimately dislikable as AllenÂ´s now-stock character has become in recent years.  Really, watching Branagh imitate Allen to a T may be an interesting idea for a skit, but after about 25 minutes it is painful, and by the end of the film it is downright embarrassing.  The Allen theme of womanizer gets his comeuppance is by now quite predictable, and this film does not deviate from it one bit.  Some of the social satire is clever, as usual, but Celebrity ends up dying on the vine because of its wildly improbable insistence that nymphomaniac supermodels and barely-legal literary beauties cannot keep their hands off of a male protagonist who neither exhibits any sort of charisma nor has any kind of achievements to his credit.  At least in many earlier Allen movies--and despite this and other recent efforts I am still a big fan of his work as a whole--there was a certain charm and allure to that one-note character of his.  But merely inserting Kenneth Branagh to talk and act exactly like Woody Allen was definitely not the solution to the creativity problems which have plagued his films lately.

Lee Simon, unsuccessful journalist & wanna-be novelist, tries to get a foot into the door with celebrities. After divorcing his wife Robin, Lee gets to meet a lot folks of the rich & / or beautiful, partly through journalism, partly because he has a script to offer. But life among those from out-of-this-world is hard, & his putative success always results in defeat. Meanwhile Robin meets a very desirable TV-producer & takes the first steps in the world of celebrities herself. This film is really a marriage mid-life crisis type movie about luck. Who has luck & who does not have luck (actually they have rotten luck). The film is done in black & white. Kenneth Branagh plays the Woody Allen role. The film has a huge roster of celebrities in big roles & many big parts with this all star cast. If you were a famous somebody actor in 1998 YOU WERE IN THIS MOVIE!! HAHAH. Branagh does a terrific job-he is fantastic in this role. Kenneth Branagh does a wicked Woody Allen imitation, and what's most fun about it is that Allen wrote and directed the picture. Is Allen lampooning himself? Was it Branagh's idea? Who decided how far to take it? And what does this all mean in Allen's ongoing dialogue with his viewers. Branagh gives us the quintessence of Woodyism. This goes a good deal beyond the average nightclub comic's Allen shtick. What Branagh offers is a finesse job of skewering, homing in precisely on his target's speech patterns and mannerisms. I disagree with many in that I do not feel like this is just another Woody Allen movie & he is just doing all the stuff over again. Boy is that wrong. This is his best film since Deconstructing Harry & Husbands & Wives. The film is hilarious but deep--like his best films. It explores our obsession with celebrities & the media's obsession with them. He embarks on a string of neo-Felliniesque encounters with the rogue's gallery of celebrity actors who bring out the best in Allen's barbed dialogue. The movie seems timelier now than in 1998. This movie is one of my favorite Woody films of the '90s, & one of his most underrated. It's also visually beautiful, in black & white with that nice the photography of Manhattan. Cast wise there is great ensemble work here, with both witty & intelligent writing from Allen & amusing set-pieces, & excellent cinematography/photography. Allen's carefully crafted, anti-celebrity image -- the shunning of interviews and so on -- is just as much a celebrity image as anything he makes fun of here. But Allen remains a very potent fantasy figure for critics and moviegoers who want to see him as something like America's resident European filmmaker, untouched by the vagaries and vulgarities of the industry he works in. His familiar, formalized, art-film aesthetic reinforces that perception. It's impressive that, in the age of blockbusters, Allen has managed to keep making movies his way. Here he captures that vapid, empty malaise of celebrity life in a hysterical way.

This is not a common thing here, but it has also happened to DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, SWEET AND LOWDOWN and now SMALL TIME CROOKS. It seems that they have something against Woody Allen and his fans, but in fact it is a problem among the distributors. However, the wait was worthy CELEBRITY is a great film.It received bad reviews in the US for no apparent reason- here in Brazil the reviews were almost universally positive. Maybe the critics are tired of Woody Allen, maybe they just didn't get his point. The truth is that CELEBRITY is no ANNIE HALL, MANHATTAN, HANNAH AND HER SISTERS or CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, but is a great film overall.The story is about a divorced couple- Lee and Robin Simon (Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis), who try to find their position in the society. Lee is a journalist who starts to write about art, so he gets closer to celebrities. He gets involved with lots of women- the futile actress Nicole Oliver (Melanie Griffith) who belongs to her husband only down the neck, a supermodel (Charlize Theron) with an erotic failure, a cold woman (Famke Janssen) who wants to live with him, and a second rate actress (Winona Ryder) who is not his obscure object of desire as he thinks. He is between finish writing his novel (after the bad reviews for his first novel) and trying to sell a script- when he meets another futile star (Leonardo DiCaprio). In resume, his life is a mess with no way-back. In the meantime, his ex-wife Robin, an English teacher, ironically gets more luck than him she meets a TV producer (Joe Mantegna), who thinks she has a future as a TV presenter. With a good story in hands, Allen turns it into an acid, funny film. But you know the laughs in his films aren't gratuitous- they come naturally, or depending on the way you get into the scene. And they are also bitter (remember the subtitles scene in ANNIE HALL)- this taste of humor is not for everyone. The funniest, best scene is when the prostitute teaches Davis' character how to do a blow-job, using a banana. As usual, Allen takes great performances from the whole cast. Kenneth Branagh has been criticized for imitating Woody Allen too much, but I think he did a great job. We already know Judy Davis (especially), Joe Mantegna and Winona Ryder are terrific, but it is a miracle what Allen can do with Melanie Griffith, Leonardo Di Caprio and Charlize Theron, usually bland performers. Charlize is the most peculiar character and delivers a great and funny performance.The main detail of the film is the use of black-and-white. This is not the first time Allen uses that (MANHATTAN, STARDUST MEMORIES, SHADOWS AND FOG), but it is almost a character in this picture- it shows a world that is even more sufocating than ours. With that, he makes an acid critic about our society, that turns superficial, futile people into instant celebrities. This is not new, of course, but here these people are also victims of the sufocating society. If a society can be interpreted by who it chooses to celebrate, it is worse than it seems to be. Allen commits some mistakes here and there with his critic, but you don't find many films like this out there- clever, funny, bitter and realistic. Remember the HELP sign on the air...

It was very well done and it is very culturally relevant. It also utilizes an all-star cast, but Woody doesn't emphasize on the star power.Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis play Lee and Robin Simon, a divorced New York couple heading in separate directions after his mid-life crisis divorce. The film then explores and critiques their adventures and lives after.Lee divorced Robin because he had married too soon and wanted to explore what was out in the world. A travel writer, he tries to insert himself in the inner circles and this is expressed through clever and witty anecdotes. He tries to seduce an actress he's interviewing, Nicole Oliver (Melanie Griffith), only to be rejected because she is married. Then he almost gets his chance to have all of his sexual fantasies fulfilled by a Supermodel (in an erotically charged performance by Charlize Theron) only to crash his car and watch her walk away. Lee commits to Bonnie, his elegant editor girlfriend (in a charged performance by the reliable Famke Janssen) only to dump her for rising starlet Nola (a typically neurotic performance by Winona Ryder). Lee also has a wild time with the hotel-trashing, druggie actor Brandon Darrow (in a funny performance by Leonardo DiCaprio)and his wild entourage. He ends up alone however, although he had experienced what he wanted to.Robin meanwhile, nearly suffers a breakdown after the divorce and stays at a Catholic retreat with her friend. She tries to make herself over at a prestigious plastic surgeon only to get a date with charming, Tony Gardella, a news reporter. Joe Mantegna plays the supposed perfect person for Robin with grace. After an uncomfortable encounter at a movie premiere with Lee, Robin indulges herself into Tony's world. She gets her own TV series, a trashy talk show. In a quirky scene she tries to get help on fellatio from a neurotic hooker (in a too-brief performance by Bebe Neuwirth). She is about to get married to Tony, when she instead runs off, unable to bear how perfect it all is. After help from a psychic, she tries to find him.As the story winds down, Robin becomes a gossip talk show host, mingling with celebrities and married to Tony. She's also pregnant. Lee is alone, having dumped Bonnie for Nola and having watched his novel float away. His relationship with the neurotic mess Nola also dies out. Their meeting is bittersweet as is the ending as they watch the movie that is being filmed when the movie started.The film has a plethora of short but sweet performances. Dylan Baker plays a charming priest who befriends Robin at her retreat. Isaac Mizrahi plays a trendy artist, a friend of the Supermodel's. Anthony Mason plays himself as a suitor of the Supermodel's at a nightclub. Michael Lerner plays the prestigious Dr. Lerner while Debra Messing plays the quirky reporter doing a story on him. Larry Pine, a Woody Allen regular plays an editor. Gretchen Mol has a minor role as Vicky, Brandon's companion in a thoroughly funny scene. Hank Azaria plays David, Nola's boyfriend in a scene set at Elaine's. Allison Janney plays a real estate agent that is interviewed by Lee while Donald Trump plays himself in an amusing cameo. Aida Turturro and Tony Sirico both have small roles. Aida plays a psychic Robin visits while Tony plays a Mafiosi guest on Robin's talk show. Jeffery Wright also has a small role in the last segment of the film as Nola's pretentious director in a play.The film for the most part is quirky, funny and not as perverse as say Deconstructing Harry. The only complaint that I can make is that while Woody Allen satirizes the current celebrity society, he goes for the easy targets when possible. He is refreshingly self-referential and in a nice surprise, he references the New York art scene, the models and movies of New York, along with cultural references to current celebrities and references to people like Andy Warhol. The soundtrack is elegant and sophisticated. Despite my small complaints, the movie is refreshing and at times hilarious. A well-done picture.

It also shows us how we as an audience can be fooled, and how we worship celebrities for moments of fabricated beauty.

The movie starts out with Woody Allen ('scuse me, Lee Simon, which is Kenneth Branaugh basically proving what I previously thought impossible -- that somebody who was not Woody Allen could pull off Woody Allen) at the highest in his life, getting beautiful women, enjoying the company of the famous elite, getting anxious over nothing... and his wife Robin Simon (Judy Davis), who is at her lowest point, being dumped by Lee and considering plastic surgery. Over the course of a year, their lives will completely reverse course, as misfortune hits Lee and fortune picks up Robin, and in the meantime no end to silliness and celebrity-related nonsense keep things chaotic, moving, and Allen-style funny.It's a pretty good movie but it's rather exhausting. At least this movie makes Allen's womanizing seem a bit more understandable, as Branaugh is much more charismatic. One of Leonardo DiCaprio's best roles is in here as a coked out screen star. Judy Davis does an amusing impression of Blanche from A Streetcar Named Desire, and then later performs fellatio on a banana. It certainly will entertain you, if you're the type to handle Allen's neurotic approach to humor. I for one am a friend.The point? Apparently, love, celebrity, all those things that people want just strips down to luck. Of course, whence in it, it all becomes so solipsistic, but this comedy of errors shows that the most solipsistic ones are the most blind to the precariousness of their position.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"very underestimated","Date":"30 October 2000","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  A precise portrait of Hollywood and its inhabitants.

Not that the movie is bad, but it certainly doesn't come up to his other recent efforts.  The film suffers by a lack of something to say.  Allen appears to want to say something about the nature of celebrity, but the message is muddy.  Judy Davis's role (the best thing in the film) is clearcut -- Allen says that you are better off achieving celebrity by being yourself and achieving it as a byproduct.  Nice sentiment, and well down.The Kenneth Branagh story, however, doesn't seem to be saying much of anything.  (It seems to be intended as a parallel contrast to the story of Davis, his ex-wife.)  Branagh's character is too immature and self-centered to be likeable (unintentionally similar at heart to Allen's character in DECONSTRUCTING HENRY -- who wasn't supposed to be likeable).  It was also a mistake to have Branagh doing a Woody Allen imitation; you immediately compare him to Allen (who probably wanted to play the part, but was too old for it) and the mannerisms are distracting.As a side note -- and spoiler -- the fact that Branagh's character, a writer who has had two novels published doesn't have a copy of his third is ludicrous (though dramatic).  What with word processors and even carbon paper, it beggars belief that he doesn't have something as backup.Some of the elements are good ones -- Judy Davis and Leonardo Di Caprio, for instance.  But the Branagh character doesn't jell and neither does the movie.  Interesting for Allen completists, but definitely one of his weaker efforts.

With Celebrity, he finally nails it. It's a beautifully Felliniesque film, not only in its structure but in Allen's affectionate use of black and white cinematography. In a Fellini film, every scene involves a large ensemble of people and infinitely busy goings-on. Hardly any more than one shot in the entire film has only one person in it. Allen, whether he likes it or not, is different. If Fellini is too dry to make the audience feel truly attached to his characters, Allen probes his own the way his own nebbishy characters probe themselves. This gives Celebrity a very effective and intriguing structure, as the film has about five million main characters, but gives them pockets of significantly focal screen time. Leonardo DiCaprio's time on screen here is told in an agitating, fast-paced vignette where we drop in smack dab in the middle of his character's personal life, watch how it spills without any self-control into his public life, and watch his oddly unpredictable and brilliantly drawn character as what can loosely be called the protagonist, Kenneth Branagh's journalist, tries to pitch his script to him and is taken aback by the overwhelming amount of distraction.Basically, Allen pinpoints the style he wished to emulated by creating a movie that is a story that could only ever truly be impacting as a movie. Like any Fellini film, there could never even be a worthy attempt made to adapt it as a play or a novel. It's too innately cinematic. Also, this particular time when Allen cannot help but seek to mold his own out of an homage to Bergman, Fellini, or Antonioni, it really truly works because he built upon it by injecting his own voice into the work. Interiors and Stardust Memories were like Bermgna and Fellini carbon copies.The cast works well for the most part, as DiCaprio plays his said role very acutely, Theron takes on a similar role with interesting reflective flair, and Judy Davis is a wonder of dramatic energy as always. Kenneth Branagh is a little awkward, though, and perhaps that's not entirely his fault. He is cast in a role that is clearly a screen personality of Woody Allen himself, but likely because Allen is too old to play such a specific role, he chose another actor, a personologically similar one but a lesser one nonetheless, not because Branagh is at all a bad or unaffecting actor but because Woody's screen persona is too much of a signature of his own. We don't want anyone else to play that role. But as one would probably imagine an actor trying to act like Woody Allen would, Branagh is smart enough to approach the neurotic, self-centrally worrisome part from his own perspective.Celebrity is much under-appreciated and is on par with the vast majority of Woody's filmography.

Jokes at the expense of shallow lifestyles among celebrities are what drive the film, though. And that's where all the laughs are.

First of all, Kenneth Branagh, known chiefly for his Shakespeare adaptations is hilarious as basically, Woody Allen. With absolute flawlessness he creates the speech pattern, the accent, and the self deprecating persona. Judy Davis gives us an amazing transformation from jilted house wife to TV talk show host. Her scenes with Branagh are priceless. In each scene another celebrated person appears to take us on a roller coaster ride of delight and terror.

Again at the IMAX we revelled in the truly magnificant performance that Brannagh gave, quite clearly playing the role that was/is Allen, but playing it so well.There were some of Allens best lines in this movie, some of his best visual gags, and some excellent performances from people who, on the whole are not renowned for their acting skills. As usual Allen gets the best from people and he deserves applauding for this.The cinematography, as usual, was excellent, the dialogue first rate, the score as ever will make another exspensive but wonderful album.Over all, I would say that this is the best film since Manhatten. In years to come this film WILL rank as one of the best films he has ever made. The fact that he was playing to a 75% full cinema at 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon is a testimony of the draw that this man has. And herein lies the dichotomy. He fills the 'arty' and off-beat cinemas, but main stream won't show him. Some films never even make it across the water. Yet Allen has films that main stream would die for, if only they were not fed the big budget Hollywood dross of the Armegeddon genre.Woody Allen films should be shown along side the  big budget special fx driven films with thin plots and see though dialogue.

Call it a matter of personal taste, but the main problem I had with the film was the complete lack of interest in any of the characters or the situations that they find themselves in; with Allen creating a shambolic, Fellini inspired freak show filled with grossly caricatured pantomime players parading from one scene to the next with no thought or feeling. When you think about the ideas behind the film, this particular presentation becomes almost genius (albeit, unintentionally so) and should have really led to some wicked satire on the nature of celebrity and the lengths that people will go to in order to maintain it. Unfortunately however, the film fails to build on this premise and becomes disengaging; largely because it has absolutely nothing of interest to say!I suppose if it was simply Allen's intention to truly capture the sense of vapid, empty malaise of celebrity life in a way that created a similar feeling for even the most inattentive of viewers, then he certainly succeeded with this; creating a film in which pretentious, narcissistic characters wander from one improbable scenario to the next, continually complaining about the dissatisfaction of their personal lives and relationships, whilst never quite seeming to realise that their actual problems are really a result of their own repugnant, self-infatuated personalities. One of his more recent films, Melinda and Melinda (2004) suffered from some similar problems - with the idea of affluent, well-to-do characters complaining about how hard life is from the comfort of their Park Avenue penthouses really crippling the identifiable elements of the drama - but even then, Allen was able to offer at least some level of technical invention and an approach to the story that was interesting and unique. Here, the style is generic and unadventurous as we follow Branagh's self-infatuated and highly deluded writer/journalist and part time Allen-caricature from one assignment to the next, usually resulting in a comic seduction of an incredibly attractive woman, and a lot of talk about his supposedly great, unfinished novel.Unsurprisingly, the lack of focus and Allen's inability to put his ideas into context or character, results in a difficult film that is sometimes OK, and other times woefully embarrassing. I understand Allen's ultimate intention and what he was trying to achieve with both the film and the characters, but for the episodic plot to really work he had to offer us some original insights, moments of imagination and a series of larger than life characters that were truly iconic. There's nothing here that is as unique, exciting and exotic as something like Nights of Cabiria (1957) or La dolce vita (1960), two films that Celebrity (1998) seems most heavily indebted to; with the characters generally trying to outdo one another in terms of bland pontification, snobbery and self-delusion. Certainly, I can understand why some viewers would enjoy the film - the cinematography is impeccable, there are some definite laugh out loud moments and some fine supporting performances from the talented and eclectic cast - however, there's nothing here that hasn't already been said before in far greater films such as Manhattan (1979), Stardust Memories (1980) and Husbands and Wives (1992), to name just three.Both Branagh and Davis are terrible as the divorced couple central to the narrative, with both actors employing the usual quirks and ticks of Allen's regular on-screen persona in their own delivery and mannerisms, with Branagh in particular trying to act the part of Woody Allen, albeit, with none of the comic timing or genuine feeling of self-deprecation. Davis is just as bad - woefully over-the-top and shouting her lines in a way that was at least fitting when she played the same part in Husbands and Wives - whilst the scene in which her character and Bebe Neuwirth's prostitute perform Fellatio on a pair of bananas is cringe-worthy and really beneath a filmmaker of Allen's great stature. Many of the other members of the cast are fine however, including Charlize Theron as a seductive supermodel, Leonardo DiCaprio as the typically hedonistic Hollywood trouble-maker, Joe Mantegna as Davis' sensitive love-interest and Famke Janssen as one of Branagh's numerous bedroom companions; but ultimately the lack of an interesting central character is a real handicap that severely affects the impact of the film.Ten years on, and Celebrity still remains one of Allen's most difficult and polarising works, and a close relation to Deconstructing Harry (1997) in terms of dissenting critical opinion amongst long term fans and admirers. For me, it is simply a film that I didn't enjoy on any level; whilst the people that did like it probably liked it for the reasons that I failed to connect with it. I suppose there are some individual factors that are interesting enough in their own right, however, for me it simply felt like Allen repeating himself; going over the same old themes and scenarios that he'd already expressed in far greater films and creating something sluggish and lazy. I'd still rank him as possibly the greatest living American filmmaker, simply off the strength of the films that he produced in the 70's and 80's, but this is surely a middling, or perhaps even mediocre effort by anyone's standards? "},{"Title":"The selfish generation","Date":"20 September 1999","Score":"9 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Woody Allen is certainly a celebrity if attention from the tabloids is any judge and well qualified to write a film about Celebrity.He lives openly in Manhattan amongst the rich yuppies he loves to write about and has attracted plenty of tabloid attention to do with his private life. Whether he has succeeded in presenting a film about the concept of celebrity is debatable though because this film throws itself in probably a dozen directions, not really leaving familiar Allen territory.His films usually feature himself playing a character very like himself or a character who is recognisably Woody Allen. He's portrayed as a dithering, well meaning but self serving sophisticate who's friends and lovers spar their way through self induced minor crises of the heart.Allen's films usually contain a myriad of set pieces, often centered about religious guilt and a fear of commitment, and they're nearly always very funny.In Celebrity the English master actor Kenneth Branagh has taken the Woody Allen part playing a journalist Lee Simon with terrific energy and authenticity.Lee is facing a mid life crisis. He confesses infidelities to his wife Robin (Australia's Judy Davis - in another wonderful performance) and then bounces from one disappointment with women and with his career to the next. He wants to write a novel but can't get together the courage. He no doubt fears he lacks the talent.Robin on the other hand has a classic female Woody Allen female break down but then haltingly blossoms when Tony (Joe Mantegna) falls unreservedly in love with her. But can she cope even with this? In fact Woody Allen films are so much about lack of confidence and are seemingly so autobiographical that it's a wonder Allen hasn't lost his nerve in real life and ended up not being able to face Central Park or a movie studio at all. It's a wonder he's not permanently in therapy (perhaps he is!)The secret must lie with the generosity and concern he feels for the rich cocaine and diamond social set he  shares. His humor is warm and never cruel, although women may take issue with this.There are some particularly demeaning (but not nasty) scenes for the women in Celebrity although humiliation isn't confined to the women. The men are often equally lost and at the mercy of their uncertainties and lack of clear direction in life.Oh to be so spoilt! Woody Allen films are often about the nearly idle rich and more importantly about the selfish generation. Love affairs always seem to be temporary affairs, even if they last years, ready to make way for a new model.Viewers, as often happens in a Woody Allen film, can play the star spotting game. As well as Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis and Joe Mantegna there's Leonardo DiCaprio, Gretchen Mol,, Famke Jansen, Winona Ryder, Bebe Neuwirth, and Charlize Theron to recognise.The wit is often sharp and very funny with solid stabs being made at Catholic idolatry, the media, supercilious film directors and spoilt brat stars. There's a fine moment of two some, hilarious, some touching.The Woody Allen moaning becomes a bit of a whine once or twice but Celebrity wins hands down with plenty of fine, fun dialogue and beautifully realised photography and a final meekly despairing plea from the scared to be committed.

There are many great moments here, but they fail to come together as a whole. Kenneth Branagh does a decent job impersonating Woody Allen, but it's sad that a role so clearly written for the Allen persona had to be performed by someone younger. Judy Davis' performance is way too overwrought and manic. Couldn't wait for her scenes to be over and there are far too many of them. It's a role that would have been more well suited to Diane Keaton at a younger age. Other stars fare much better. Charlize Theron excels as an oversexed fashion model. Leonardo DiCaprio's episode is a shrewd display of egotism run amok - I don't think Leo's ever been better than he is in this movie. Winona Ryder comes across well as a struggling young actress who leaves a string of broken hearts behind her. Beautiful black and white photography of New York City, an Allen trademark, keeps things visually interesting. Celebrity should have said more with less.

And yet, there are sporadic choice moments / lines / situations in it, like for example the restaurant scene where Branagh meets Ryder again after a long time and tries to start a conversation with her while the other people at their table continue their own talking. Although there is no apparent reason why this film had to be shot in black & white (in fact, in one of the best jokes in the film, a director who always shoots in black and white is called an arty, pretentious a**hole!), the cinematography itself is exquisite. There are some pointed jabs on the issue of celebrity; on a more personal note, the final shot of the film is perhaps one of the brightest ideas Allen ever had. Judy Davis stands out in a huge cast, giving an all-out comic performance (some cast members are not used to their full advantage). And Winona Ryder has probably never looked as transcendently, glowingly beautiful as she does in Celebrity. **1/2 out of 4. "},{"Title":"A disappointment from Woody Allen but not that bad","Date":"22 June 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" It seems like Celebrity is one of Woody Allen's most polarising films and that is understandable. It is one of my least favourite films of his along with What's Up Tiger Lily, To Rome with Love and Cassandra's Dream(remember September, Shadow and Fog and Curse of the Jade Scorpion not being very good, but all three need a re-watch), but that is not to say it is terrible because it isn't. It is wonderfully photographed(by far and away the best thing about the film), not surprising seeing as this is Sven Nykvist- responsible for a lot of the photography for the films of Ingmar Bergman, the best of which are some of the most visually beautiful and best films ever made- we're talking about. It does have some funny and witty lines, the best of which really sparkle, not to the extent they're quotable but they are funny still and raise a good smile. There are some scenes like Bebe Neuwirth teaching Judy Davis how to improve her sexual skills and Leonardo DiCaprio's tempting Branagh, or at least trying to, into group sex that are memorable. Allen's direction is a little unfocused in places but his style is unmistakable still, so Celebrity at least feels like a Woody Allen film and it has enough quirky moments to not be too dull. The performances on the most part are a lot of fun as well, Winona Ryder, Bebe Neuwirth, Leonardo DiCaprio(who had the most energy in the cast) and Joe Montegna being particularly so. Famke Janssen is appealing too, in short though this is a case of the supporting cast being better than the leads.Kenneth Branagh I have to agree doesn't work here(a shame because he is a great actor and just as talented a director), giving a rare irritating performance that is so careful channelling Woody Allen that he comes across as a pale imitation instead with no sense of originality or coming into his own. That his material is not the best works against him as well. Judy Davis is a little better with some signs of charm and humanity but a lot of her performance is way overdone, for somebody who was so good in Husbands and Wives it was disappointing. The script and gags have their moments and much of it is most admirable, but the humour could have been more biting and more acerbic. It was a very good example of humour that was funny in parts but wasn't consistent, it wasn't clever, sharp or thought provoking enough and came across as mean-spirited in places. And there are scenes that just don't work, some of the blow-job jokes did to me come across as distasteful while the scenes with Davis's doorstepping television interviews, Ryder's rehearsal in seducing women and the opening of the gallery in Soho were particularly risible. The story could have been much tighter and could have dealt with its themes more freshly, much of it is very muddled, painfully predictable and rambling as well as dealt with in a self-indulgent way and paced ploddingly. The characters don't have much personality(excepting DiCaprio's) and very little of Celebrity rings true, the risible scenes being very difficult to take at face value. In conclusion, definitely could have been worse considering the dislike it has but Celebrity personally was a disappointment. 5/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Woody Allen's back again","Date":"31 July 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" What makes Woody Allen so good (besides the witty dialogues) is the striking way in which he failed (and to a lesser extent succeeded) customers can bring in pictures. Often Allen's films run the relations piece for reasons you often hear around you. The power of him is that he often credible and interesting to capture on film.In Celebrity, it is not about nothing, but it is about something... the fraud of celebrity existence, having relationships in this world, no longer appreciating your current relationship, falling in love with another, or rather thinking that you are in love with another. For me, Woody a great director who knows me regularly to laugh at, but also knows how to intrigue with his outlook on relationships between people / loved ones and know me in a fresh way to point out the common pitfalls.Normally I find Woody himself comfortably in the lead in his films, but in Celebrity, he made a good choice to give the role to someone else. Woody namely fits less in the world of glitter more than glamour. His replacement is also good and again I have again enjoyed a Woody movie.

And he is crying Help! right off the screen. Because they are reasons to fear. The world begins to look like a TV show. Fame has depriced. Instead of real qualities it gives us a parody of them (a preacher from TV thinks about whether The Beatles were more popular than Jesus).The main thing is how to find yourself in this world. Allen seems to doubt. He think that we might be zombificated. Let's look at Robin Simon (Judy Davis) from his movie. Soon ago she was an English teacher, A specialist in Chaucer's poetry. Then she met a handsome producer Tony Gardella (Joe Mantegna). She becomes a host of a TV show and makes stupid interviews. What's worse, she feels good doing that. She sees nothing inappropriate in walking into Charles Manson's (the massacre at Polanski's villa was his inspiration) cell with camera. The TV producer seems to be a modern wizard. At a family party his relatives ask his to do this or that. He can do everything.The character of the film, celebrity journalist Lee Simon (Keneeth Branagh), can't resist of that kind of life's luxuries. His first two novels weren't successful. He has problems with finishing the third one. He'd rather work on a movie screenplay. It's bigger fame and bigger cash. Only a simple old woman, Gardella's grandmother is left with the remains of sanity. She is disturbed when hearing about a guy that was being held hostage by some thugs and now he is giving performances in schools as a hero. She asks surprised whether it is enough.Celebrity is a great fun about revealing the rules of that crying game that involves selling your own identity. The memoirs of a star taken back to the house she used to live in, seem like if they were written for a tabloid. A young actor Darrow (self-ironic DiCaprio) demolishes the hotel room, but the owners have nothing against his destructive actions. His presence in the hotel is in fact an advertisement. Darrow pretends for a second there that he takes life seriously. Just as he treats the script given by Simon. But all in all Darrow is interested only in parties, women, drugs and boxing fights. Nola, the statist (Winona Ryder) will go to bed with anyone who will make her an actress.In Woody Allen's movie people are attracted to fiction. Nola allows Simon to seduce her when he speaks to her with words take out of a novel. The reality gives no one satisfaction, need re-editing. That is why everyone is after Dr Lupus, a plastic surgeon.For many years now it is said that Allen is repeating his own motives and frustrations. Maybe it's true, but he still does that perfectly. He is even capable of making fun of directors shooting in non-color, while his own film is shot in that technique (cinematography by Sven Nykvist). The greatness of Allen allows the viewer to accept with astonishment such scenes that they would have been inappropriate if made by anyone else. That includes a runaway bride five minutes before wedding and a couple breaking off in a moment the removal company places her stuff in his apartment.A master is a master.

However the first part is much more brilliant than the second one. The latter loses a bit of the brightness and cleverness of the former. Kenneth Branagh who replaces Allen as a talking machine gun analyzing everything and most often undecided, does a splendid role. The sequence with Leonardo DiCaprio is particularly funny in its crazy development seasoned with a pinch of nonsense which makes it delicious. The problems of marriage and divorce are once again present and as usually treated in a humorous way. Not the best of Allen's movies but one of the best indeed.

It seems like he can't get enough of those neurotic characters that he bases more or less all his pictures on.Kenneth Branagh is a disguised W.A. and practically plays his role; he actually mimics W.A., which is somewhat annoying. Like usual in W.A.'s films, Branagh's character is a man who doesn't have a hard time finding - and getting women; his weak spot is rather that he never get satisfied with them (which is pretty hard to feel sorry about). So, what does this movie have that other W.A. pictures didn't already bring us? Most of all, it has a tremendous (to use a typical Allen word) beautiful photo. However, you could argue if this is the kind of film that fits well with Nykvist's black and white photo. Some scenes do, and they are great, but on the whole, I am doubtful.The movie does get better towards the end. It's not bad, but it could have been better.

This brings me back to Brannagh, I just can't stop being amazed at this performance, which brings out all the neurotic desperation, fear of death and ultimate sadness which underlies Woody Allen's comedies and perhaps all great comedies. The photography and the direction is terrific, I caught echoes of Manhattan, Stardust Memories and even Annie Hall; somehow it just works and doesn't seem at all redundant. This film is a little gem.  "}{"Title":"A muddled but enjoyable spin on the effects of fame","Date":"13 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  After continually bringing his audience through one high after another with a brilliant comeback in the 90's, Woody Allen has a little bit of a letdown - but still manages to entertain - with Celebrity.  There are many components of the film that make sense, but the whole balance between showcasing the pratfalls of fame and chronicling his usual neurotic-Manhattan marital fallout don't always work.  Why Allen cast Branaugh to play Woody is puzzling.  Perhaps Woody is all too aware of the audience's despondence with him cuddling up to women one-third his age, or maybe Branaugh was used just to see what kind of response it would provoke.  Either way, Branaugh does well; it just depends if you can stomach him playing Woody.There are as many good jokes here as any other Woody film, but the frame of reference is different.  His jokes don't exclusively concern the absurdity of fame, but also how ridiculously far it extends into American culture and how it's now seen as the ultimate power play.  The fame of religion, sex, excess, the lack thereof and the just plain fame of fame (It's all showbusiness! Branaugh complains).  Allen acutely demonstrates how fame corrupts a person (Branaugh shamelessly hawking his screenplay) and how some seem to find normalcy in life despite it (Joe Mantenga's easy-going TV producer).  We also see how the culture of celebrity affects everyday people and how they think.  Witness the scene where a group of rabbis, appearing on a talk show, calmly ask beforehand Have the skinheads eaten all the bagels?  Meaning it didn't matter to a group of Jewish clergymen that they were sharing a green room with Nazis, because they're about to be on TV.  Also consider the scene where the wonderful Judy Davis (somewhat reprising her excellent role in the fantastic Deconstructing Harry) seeks out a high class hooker with nervous, star-struck adoration in search of sexual advice.Just when the film starts to sag (or seem in search of a plot) we are given a brief jolt by the crafty Leonardo DiCaprio.  Woody may have predicted the attention DiCaprio was about to attract with Titanic and offered him this role out of sympathy.  DiCaprio gives a frenetic cameo as Brandon Darrow, allowing him to lampoon his public image before the press ever constructed it that of the young, spoiled movie star.  With this bit part, DiCaprio joins Woody in extending his middle finger towards the media (as Woody had been doing in his work throughout the late 90's).  Overall, the film is quite puzzled in its presentation.  The black-and-white cinematography is a nice touch, it's doubtful Woody chose B&W for the same panoramic methods he held in the late 70's / early 80's.  I assume the B&W photography was designed to impress you with more of a behind-the-scenes feel.  Maybe some of the humor got lost in Woody's determination to hold contempt for the famous high life, but Celebrity is worth one look if you consider yourself a mild Woody fan.

Woody Allen's Celebrity is basically a harsh criticism on modern day society, I say it had it coming! Allen is trying to show us the we (the American public) like to accept odd things, which is perfectly true about us (and to be fair, so people don't think I'm being a snob, I freely throw myself into the ring also). As in the movie, when people do terrible things, they are turned into celebrities! Why do we do this? This is what's at the core of Allen's film. Why are we so quick to give a basketball player 20 million dollars, but, shy away from giving that same amount of money to some sort of medical research? Why has politics turned into some sorta daytime soap opera? These are things Celebrity trys to answer. The only problem I have with the movie is, it's not mean enough. It's not tough enough! The movie needed more bite to it. I think perhaps one of the reasons many people hated this movie is because Allen is trying to tell us, we're stupid. I know not one person who likes to hear someone bad mouth them. And the same goes with this movie. If it's telling us we do moronic things, some people could get a bit mad. Now, do start to think that's why I feel everyone hates this movie. The other reason is because Woody Allen wrote and directed it. I often wonder if Allen would keep his name  away from his movies if people would go see them. It's as if once people find out Woody Allen made the film people are turned off. Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis star as a divorced married couple, Lee and Robin Simon. Lee (Branagh) is a second rate journalist who is trying to sell a screenplay. Robin (Davis) is trying to get her life back on track and put Lee behind her. After Lee interviews or has run in's with people like famous actress Nicole Oliver (Melanie Griffith), and a supermodel (Charlize Theron) Lee starts to think his life is meaningless. And who are we to disagree. I don't want to give away all of the plot here, but, Branagh by the end of the movie is where Robin started and Robin is where Lee dreams of being, happy! The acting by Famke Janssen and Winona Ryder is delightful to watch, especially Ryder. I thought Bebe Neuwirth was very funny as a hooker who trys to teach Robin a few tricks. And Joe Mantegna was pretty good as well, only problem is he wasn't given enough screentime. I absolutelly hated, Leonardo DiCapro! He just cannot act, I'm sorry all you Leo fans. All he does in his scene is scream, while yes, I'll give him credit, he has a very loud voice, that doesn't make up for his zombie look through his part. Wonderful black & white photography by Sven Nykvist, truly one of the highpoints of the film. And Allen has written a very sharp and witty script that is just as great as his directing.

The usual themes are here--failed marriages, writer's block, sexual voraciousness--but Woody makes it fresh again.  In fact, Celebrity is a summation of the last decade of Woody Allen movies, and may well be one of  his very best.Whereas in Deconstructing Harry (1997) Woody finally achieved his version of Wild Strawberries, the much-admired and emulated Ingmar Bergman classic, Celebrity is his answer to Fellini's La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2.  As in those two films, Celebrity examines infidelity, aging, and fame.  The central figure (the Woody Allen character of course) is played by Kenneth Branagh who gives a superb performance albeit eerie in its realism.  He perfectly captures Woody's famous neurotic personality.  As Lee Simon, he's a travel writer who interviews the rich and famous, pedals a movie script and an unfinished novel, and has an eye for beautiful women.  His marriage to Robin (a zany and sensational Judy Davis-again!) has fizzled (in his eyes), so he ends it and becomes a mid-life crisis in an Aston-Martin.  Ultimately though, he succeeds only in screwing up his emotionless life.  Meanwhile, Robin finds not only emotional stability and unquestioning love in David (nicely underplayed by Hank Azaria), a successful TV producer who accidentally enters her life, but unexpected fame of her own.This central story line is expertly woven with numerous very funny but seemingly unconnected sub plots and episodes.  The various cameo performances by Winona Ryder, Leonardo DiCaprio, Charlize Theron, Melanie Griffith, and others are terrific, the beautiful black and white cinematography by Swedish veteran Sven Nykvist is a visual feast, the script excels with great dialogue, and of course the tight direction all make this one of Woody Allen's best.

Yeah right.OK so we'll suspend reality for that one. It's amazing Woody can make good movies without knowing any normal people. The characters in this flic are so superficial they make the cast of Seinfeld look like Ghandi, Mandela, Mother Theresa and a few Buddhist monks. The Allen/Branaugh/whomever character is the most despicable, narcisistic, repulsive person on the planet. Much like Woody himself.The movie tells us that there are celebrities on every level of existence. You can be a celebrity in your house, your family your neighborhood whatever; but whatever level of celebrity you reach you always feel insecure and insignificant. It's best to be yourself, do your best and try to be happy. This is a great movie and I don't use the term loosely. It's not preachy, it just turns over the rock of urban American society and lets us peek at the disease and garbage underneath.Joe Montegna and Judy Davis do Oscar quality work. DiCaprio is in a great segment that is so good it's hard to tell if he adds anything or not; probably not. Winnona Ryder is lovely as usual. The big model whose name escapes me is beautifully awful. I think Woody used a terrible actress on purpose to get back at all the models who have rejected him. Finally Anthony Mason is da bombThis is the best dialogue in my Woody memory and I will definitely see it again. Another reason to see it is that New York Times political columnist Maureen Dowd absolutely killed it. Be Well Jimmy Bagga Doughnuts "},{"Title":"If you're a Woody Allen fan, you will like it.

It is overly written and has a large cast of today's well known screen personalities with some stars.  The dialogue is the usual talkly Allenesque verbiage, for which he has become famous.  Kenneth Branagh has the Woody Allen role, presumably because Woody has become too old for it, and performs Woody's ticks and mannerisms to the point of parody.  The weaknesses in the film are (1) that Branagh is able to earn the interest of such attractive women (never believable), and (2) Joe Mantegna's interest in the Judy Davis' paranoid, goofball character is never remotely believable and is in fact never explained.  What is remarkable is that Allen is able to bring out a wonderful performance by Winona Ryder, something I have never seen before from this wide eyed, cupie doll actress.  This film is probably only going to be really enjoyed by strong Woody Allen fans and fans who like to see a lot of movie stars parading across the screen.

I'm not too familiar with the man's work yet, but what I've seen so far was OK. Now that I've seen it, I'm puzzled about the fact why this movie doesn't score any better, because in my opinion it really wasn't that bad. One thing that worked well for instance was the story.Lee Simon hasn't got a successful career. He has always been a journalist, but what he really wants is to become a famous writer. He has already published two novels - both were sabred down by the press - and has finished a movie script. After divorcing his wife Robin, he tries to meet as many rich people and celebrities, models,... as he can, but he isn't all that successful in that either. In the meantime his ex-wife meets a very desirable TV-producer and takes her first steps in the world of celebrities, a world which she has always despised...Even though this is a Woody Allen movie and this story is clearly based on his own life, you'll not see him in it. That's OK with me, but somehow it also felt a bit strange. Why would a man like Allen write such a movie and than not perform in it like he always does? I really don't know, but I'm sure that he had his reasons for it. But don't let that be a reason not to watch this movie. Kenneth Branagh is at least as good in the role. His performance was really good, although I must say that he wasn't the biggest surprise in this movie. Personally I was more surprised by Charlize Theron who played the role of a supermodel and did a great job with that role. Of course all other actors were more than just OK as well, but what else can you expect from people like Melanie Griffith, Winona Ryder... What I also liked in this movie was the typical humor and the sometimes biting criticism on Allen's own world. Take for instance the part in which he lets one of his characters say He's terribly pretentious. He is one of those assholes who film in black and white, while this movie too has been shot in that way. Another great moment is when he makes fun of movie critics, but there are so many good jokes and laughs included in this movie that it is impossible to name them all. I guess that if you can't stand Allen's kind of humor, you better don't even watch this movie, because it's full of it, but when you like it, you shouldn't hesitate to give it a try, because there are some fine examples of it to be found in this movie.All in all this movie deserves a lot better than the actual rating of 6.2/10. The acting is nice, the story has been well written and is full of excellent jokes and biting criticism. I really liked what I saw and I believe that this movie deserves at least a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10.

This is pretty much the attempt to update Annie Hall -- amorous trials and tribulations of neurotic Manhattaners, this time with a celebrity twist to it -- but unfortunately in such a way as to make you wish you'd be watching the original. If you haven't seen Annie Hall then you might find this refreshing, but you'd still be better advised to watch the original instead. The problem is that our old friend Allen Konigsberg doesn't have anything to say about celebrities that really needed to be said, that would make this movie worthwhile. Instead, the inclusion of high-falutin' celebs only adds to this movie's implausibility (such as when filmstar Melanie Griffith basically falls over herself to offer our everyman hack Branagh oral sex). Almost more than with Allen you keep wondering what that endless string of divas, supermodels and budding actresses see in Branagh's character. Are stutter and occasional rhetorical diarrhea really that cute?On the other hand, great performance from Judy Davis, and her storyline is more interesting too. It's also fun to see also those then budding young stars such as Leonardo di Caprio, Charlize Theron and Winona Ryder, who have since all become staples, at a time when they hadn't yet dropped their thespic gonads (figuratively speaking).PS a few later, I've pretty much forgotten this movie.

A couple (Branagh and Davis) split after 15 years and move in entirely different directions. Leigh (Branagh) becomes obsessed by the glittery world he has only observed as a journalist, but discovers he is, in Allen-speke, a thinker not a do-er, paralysed from participating successfully. The twist is that his neurotic Catholic ex-wife accidentally ends up working in fluff television doing lifestyle pieces on the stars, and in the inevitable looking glass world of tv, becomes a minor celebrity herself. Along the way there are plenty of swipes at the United States own plastic monarchy, the eponymous celebrities. Its a mess. Despite some good jokes and a truly arresting performance from Judy Davis this is probably the worst film of what has been Allen's renaissance decade. Chief blame must lie with the director for casting Kennenth Branagh as his middle-age stand-in. Allen's films are in the main carried by his leading man (himself, natch) and Celebrity is no different. If the public long-ago became happy to lose sight of the division between Allen the man and Allen the character this is one sudden wake-up call. The charmingly self-effacing yet witty persona has gone badly awry here. The same lines and mannerisms delivered by a light English actor sound cloying, derivative and irritating. When one considers the success of John Cusack (Bullets over Broadway) in a similar 'substitute' role one can only wonder at how Allen took his eye off the ball in casting one of Peter's friends. Worse, the themes of a man unsure of his emotional and career goals are all borrowed from 'Manhattan'-era Allen; even down to discussions of 'polymorphous perversity' and the sublimated masculinity inherent when bookish types buy period sportscars. The characters endlessly talk about celebrity without really ever making any substantial criticisms. Yes, it makes for a colourful backdrop, but to what is essentially a lukewarm Allen-by-the-numbers midlife crisis-comedy. Shame.

This isn't fair, no, but it's inevitable.  While I will certainly admit that Celebrity is far from Woody Allen's best work, I did endeavor to focus on the film itself and try to ignore the disappointments that come from dashed expectations.  In that light, I'm pleased to report that Celebrity is a good film.  First, let's get something out of the way.  I'm sick to death of people complaining about Kenneth Branaugh imitating Woody Allen.  Ok, so if you happen to find it irritating, well, then it'll pretty much ruin the movie for you.  That's fair.  But I don't find it irritating in the least.  Moreover, I think it's a legitimate artistic choice which succeeds in what it sets out to do.  Consider  it wasn't Woody Allen's idea for Branaugh to ape his own screen persona.  In fact, Allen did all he could to discourage Branaugh from this approach, because he knew critics would skewer it.  But Branaugh decided to play it that way regardless.  Why?  Well, perhaps to make it funny.  Looking at the script, it's a perfect role for Allen to have played himself, and Allen would have made it extremely funny.  However, the role really needed a younger, more handsome actor.  So, what's the ideal solution?  Get a younger, more handsome actor to deliver the same performance Woody Allen would have.  You can debate all you want whether or not this is a good idea (as, presumably, Allen and Branaugh did), but I think it's a legitimate artistic decision.  Anyway, it isn't Branaugh that pulls this film down, in my opinion.  It's the lack of focus.  Allen's films frequently include a number of major characters.  This allows him to explore an issue from several different viewpoints.  He does this here, but Celebrity seems to lack the central core that binds most of his films together.  It's exploring the idea of celebrity, and raising all sorts of questions and issues about it, but it seems to lack a coherent, central thesis.  It doesn't seem to have any strong premise at all.  So, the film consists of disconnected pieces fitting together into a sort of formless, unsatisfying whole.  But the pieces are funny, insightful, well-acted, and gorgeously shot.  So how bad can it really be? Plus, I think what framework the film does have is overlooked by most of the audience.  Some viewers here have said that the film is about making movies in contemporary Hollywood.  It's not.  That is one aspect of celebrity that this film explores.  But this film is packed with almost every conceivable form of celebrity, from movie star to senator to literature critic to TV weather man to coma patient.  Yet people seem to fixate on the Leonardo DiCaprio sequence (in my opinion, the weakest part of the film).  Why?  Perhaps because Leo is such a celebrity.  As usual for Allen, this film boasts a tremendous supporting cast of famous and not-so famous actors.  Charlize Theron, Joe Mantegna, Bebe Neuwirth, Famke Janssen, Hank Azaria and Winona Ryder all put in strong performances in supporting roles of various depths.  The only weak link, acting wise, is DiCaprio, who is entirely unconvincing.This film, while quite legitimately not numbered among Allen's strongest films, has never the less been unfairly maligned.  It's funny, it raises interesting issues and makes insightful points about it's subject matter, and it looks great.  What more do you want?

This film by Allen is shot in black & white, is pretentious, self-serving and self-indulgent.  There is a story in here somewhere that seeks to explore the nature and effects of fame, but toward that end the viewer is subjected to a vast array of unsympathetic characters, mediocre performances and a lot of endless stammering and hand wringing.  Kenneth Branagh should be happy with this one, however, because for him there is no place to go from here but up; this is far and away the nadir of his film career.  He plays Lee Simon, a writer, a role written by Allen obviously with himself in mind, and Branagh does little more with it than give a Woody Allen impersonation throughout the entire movie.  Inexplicably, he fails to create any semblance of an original character, so caught up apparently with `doing Woody,' and the result is a ridiculous caricature that lacks any credibility and is annoying in the extreme.  How a terrific actor like Branagh, with so many personal tools at his disposal, could produce such a pretentious portrait is beyond comprehension.  Judy Davis comes off looking bad as well; playing essentially the same type of role as she did in Allen's `Deconstructing Harry' (which she pulled off so well), she has been `over-Woodied' in this one, taking her character of Robin (Lee's wife) to a teeth-clenching extreme.  Watching such a gifted actress give such a fingernails-scraping-the-blackboard performance is almost beyond endurance.

Everything else, including the abyssmal Annie Hall, I find pretentious, silly and so incredibly boring.  Deconstructing Harry was one of the worst films I have ever seen, and even though this film isn't as bad DH, it is still awful.  What I don't understand is why Hollywood producers continue to fund Allen films.  Do they actually make money?  Does the studio ever turn in a profit after all is said and done?  I don't see how.  And at first it surprised me as to all the positive comments on here about this flick, but then I realized that it is only hard core, die hard Allen fans that will comment on this piece of garbage anyway.  So it is only natural that most of the people in here are going to like Celebrity, because they already like Woody Allen as it is.  I guess that would be like me seeing a Bill Paxton film, no matter how bad it is, I will always like it ( by the way, there are no bad Bill Paxton films!!!).  Celebrity is a film about one character going through a journey after his marriage breaks up.  And of course his marriage is in shambles because of infidelity.  What else could it possibly be?

When Allen has his brilliant final shot, it was supposed to be symbolic of the main characters life.  To me it was symbolic of how I felt by sitting through this film.****  There is one final comment that I have to make.  It has little to do with the film itself except to say that it concerns Leonardo DiCaprio.  Why is it that Hollywood is claiming that he is now the hottest star in the world?  They claim it because Titanic was the biggest film ever made and teenage girls were throwing themselves at him.  People say that he is going to be the next Tom Cruise or Will Smith in terms of box office appeal.  But do people not remember that it was the film that made Titanic as great as it was, and as good he was in it, he was but one part of the movie.  If that was true ( that he made the film the hit that he did ) then Celebrity would have made 100 million just from his name alone.  But it didn't.  It didn't because young women don't want to see him in this kind of role, they want to see him in Titanic.  If you remember before Titanic, he was always considered a great actor that no one really knew about.  But now he is in Titanic and  Oh my God, he is the hottest thing since Marlon Brando from the 50's.  Tell me why no one went to see Celebrity if Leo is so hot.  Why?  I'll tell you why.  Because Leo is not as hot as people say and think and because Celebrity is not a good movie.  That's all I got to say about that.

Whenever Allen makes a movie that is so blatantly related to his own personal life, the outcome is never good. Branaugh stutters through a mid-life crises in the same manner I'm sure Allen did himself during his divorce from Mia Farrow. He deals with the ups and downs of being single, middle aged and sort of successful by dating younger women and immersing himself in the world of actors and actresses who are certainly out of his league. Thankfully Allen did not cast himself as the love interest of Melanie Griffith or Wynona Ryder. I hardly believed that Helen Hunt would have fallen for him in the curse of the jade whatever... In any case watching a younger version of Allen at his most obnoxious stumble through life in the shadows of the young and beautiful was to be frank, boring.

It may be just her character is supposed to be played this way, but it looks like Davis herself couldn't calm down at all during filming. That aside, I love the beginning and ending with the Help in the sky and the final sequence at the film premiere is haunting. Sure, this is a Fellini knockoff but who better to imitate? On a more physical level this has to rank at the top for Charlize Theron's sexiest time on screen. She looks almost unapproachable here, like beyond super model status. Her moments are all too brief but memorable and most of them hit the wow factor without any dialogue. She could stand in a corner and still be a knockout.

Moreover, he seems to have noticed that exhibiting his adventures with women who are often three times younger (Juliette Lewis in Husbands and Wives, for instance) no longer appeals to the audience. But his obsessive vigor has not been extinguished after all these decades, enabling him to clock out at least one film per year (a feat that no living American director can duplicate). In 1998, Woody has to resort to other venues of expression a computerized ant and the former Prince of Denmark himself, Kenneth Branagh. For Celebrity, the usually well-articulate and consistently noble Brit transforms into a bumbling, confused version of Allen, laying it on like some sort of an Elvis impersonator strangely amusing and absurd at the same time. Branagh's act is not terrible by any means, but one cannot help realizing that it's a mere imitation of a master whose style is unique and unreproductible. Aside from this fundamental flaw, and the not-so-subtle homage to a certain Fellini masterpiece about a journalist trying to run with the Bohemian pack, (just as Deconstructing Harry the year before was to 8 1/2) , the film is as good as anything that Allen made during the 90's. It's all pure, undistilled Woody cynical, exhillarating, malevolent toward every aspect and product of society (except old Jazz), and of course, saturated with appropriately hilarious sex jokes. How this doesn't become redundant from one movie to another is known only to the director. As always, the pace is lightning-fast, with virtually no pauses in the dialogue, or dull, lingering shots something seldom matched in indie film and practically unheard of in Hollywood. The five supporting females are in most excellent form from Judy Davis (typecast as a neurotic) who inexplicably generates sex appeal, to Winona Ryder, who is simply beyond description. Leo DiCaprio's brief semi-autobiograhpical turn is the definite highlight of what could have been Allen's best film of the decade if he had only tried to create a protagonist whose mannerisms were slightly different from his own.

But after seeing Celebrity I wondered, has Woody run out of original, exciting ideas? Go rent Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Crimes and Misdemeanors and you will get all of the plot situations of Celebrity done better. The story besides being unoriginal, tries to do too much. Celebrity has too many characters which bog down the story. (For instance, the Winona Ryder role seemed tacked on.) Instead of having one Woody Allen type, Celebrity has two! But while Judy Davis handles the insecure neurotic role well, Kenneth Branagh is so extremely whinny sometimes that his voice sounded like finger nails on a chalk board. His role needed to be drastically edited down and it might have worked. Why the music from the 20's and 30's? This was ok for a period movie such as Bullets Over Broadway but it made me think that Woody didn't have the money to pay for a decent film score. Why black and white? If a movie has mundane scenes like Celebrity, then why not shoot it in color? A black and white film calls for spectacular photography like Manhattan.Now that that is off my chest, I must say that I did enjoy parts of Celebrity. Judy Davis is a terrific comic actress and has several good scenes. Leonardo DiCaprio has a fine cameo as the spoiled movie star. The car crash scene with Branagh and Charlize Theron is very funny. In some ways Allen is trying to bring more ethnically diverse characters into his stories which makes sense when the locale is New York City. But these Italian Americans or African Americans are just a backdrop for the same Yuppie type of characters from his older films.I give Allen credit for taking on an ambitious subject. The overall plot about the confused gossip columnist/publicist reminded me of Fellini's La Dolce Vita and I think Allen again tried to draw inspiration from Fellini, one of his main influences.

Kenneth Branagh, doing a dogged but effective imitation of the film's director, Woody Allen, plays a self-obsessed would-be novelist circulating in the demimonde of Manhattan artistic chic. He is plagued with a pointless case of satyriasis;  his incessantly propelling lust seems to have neither a emotional nor, weirdly enough, even a physical dimension.  I thought of the shades circulating and moaning in the eight circle of Dante's hell.  Humorless, solipsistic (a literary critic in the film uses that wonderful word to describe the character's writing), fretful, unfetching, he brings to mind  the classic lament of the unrealized dweeb  `I'm not much, but I'm all I ever think about.'   	I found the film both sad and frightening, although it was intended to be neither.  I also was reminded of the famous play of Sartre, although here the Huis Clos is all of Manhattan, rather than one room.   I will mention only a single humiliating scene, that in which a hooker, teaching Judy Davis to administer oral sex, chokes on the banana serving as the instructional tool and has to be administered the Heimlich maneuver.	I'm sorry that it took 9/11 to overshadow this artistic train wreck, and to convince us that that city has both love and soul, and is populated not with Dantean shades sniggering as they lavish their emptiness on each other, but rather with real people and their attendant hopes and agonies.  By contrast, all the characters in this film were nothing more than colliding oil slicks. 	Woody has enlisted the talents of some of the world's great actors, but to what end?  Branagh is a consummate technician, and there is not a single false note in his American accent nor, indeed, in the speech of any other non-American native in the film, including Judy Davis.  One should carefully compare Branagh's performance in this film, though,  with that in the masterful 2001 tv film  `The Conspiracy.'  The subject there is the Wansee conference wherein the details of the final solution were hammered out.  Branagh plays Oberstgruppenfuhrer Reinhard Heydrich, Head of the Security Police and Security Service, the architect of the master plan to rid Europe of its Jews.  Powerful, charismatic, twinkling with irony, deeply frightening, Branagh's portrait of this ubermonster is flawless, and the contrast with the present performance suggests, disturbingly enough,  that evil, at least artistically,  may sometimes be more moral than vapidity.

Spike has at least at times shown potential for getting out of his untalented hole but Woody seems to feel driven to continue to use his name solely as a driving force. And all those actors still buy into it and his outdated potential. Shame on them! I know and you know they have talent but they continue to put out movies that fall shorter in results than a soldier on the first day of basic training. How do you sit in an editing room and look at the final copy of this film and say 'oh yea this is a great film.' This movie definitely puts Woody on one of those one hit wonder shows. It seems like a long way from 'Annie Hall' and he still can't find that magic. Somebody get this guy a road map or at least make him take filmmaking 101 over again.      "},{"Title":"A Rare Misfire for Allen","Date":"1 January 2012","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Celebrity (1998) ** (out of 4) Disappointing feature from writer-director Woody Allen has him taking shots of celebrities but the end result is just bland. Kenneth Branagh plays a Manhattan entertainment writer who starts to lose control of his life after getting a divorce from his wife (Judy Davis). A year later he's trying to get a script and novel off the ground while his ex hits a string of good luck after suffering a breakdown. CELEBRITY was mangled by critics when it was released but over the past few years it seems to have gained a small cult following but this time out I must say I'm on the side of the critics. I'm sure there were some good ideas going around Allen's head but whatever happened between his mind and paper is something rather shocking because the problem here is without question his screenplay. It's weird to think but at 113- minutes this here is actually one of the longest running films from Allen and what's so amazing is that it probably says the least. The film is certainly trying to make fun of rich New Yorkers and stuck-up and spoiled Hollywood types but there's never any hint of insider's knowledge and it's as if Allen didn't want to go all out. I'd probably go as far as to call the screenplay lazy. Just take a look at a young, violent actor played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The entire sequence with him screaming and trying to beat up his girlfriend just comes off very weak. You even have a bit with a model (Charlize Theron) who has an orgasm no matter where she's touched. Neither of these segments are any good but the sad thing is that they're perhaps the best stuff in the film. Another problem I had was with the performance by Branagh. There's no question that he's one of the most talented actors out there but he's just horrible playing what's basically a version of Woody Allen. The mannerisms don't work and the actor just never captures that nervous twitch of Allen. One of the best performances in the film actually goes to Winonna Ryder playing a love interest in the film. Davis is also pretty good in her role but the screenplay doesn't do her character any favors. Michael Lerner, Joe Mantegna, Gretchen Mol and Melanie Griffith round out the supporting cast. CELEBRITY is without question a rare misfire from Allen. The only real thing going for it is the brilliant cinematography by Sven Nykvist who makes the film look a lot better than it actually is.

And another if you must make a film about the making of films, whatever you do, don't make it about Hollywood.  Films about Hollywood are invariably tedious.  At least, they're more tedious than they would have been if they'd been about something else.You think there are exceptions?  Look closely.  I can think of two obviously brilliant films about Hollywood Singin' in the Rain, and Barton Fink.  (The former is Stanley Donen's best work, the latter is the Coen brothers'.)  Both these films are set in the past - even Singin' in the Rain was set twenty-four years in the past - and don't purport, in any way, to be about the present.  You need to be able to place some distance between yourself and your subject matter in order to photograph it properly.  So it's really films about CONTEMPORARY film-making that die on their feet, and even then, it's not the subject matter per se that kills them it's the insidious little worm of self-reference.The film that comes closest to being an exception to THIS rule is Sunset Boulevard, which works for a variety of reasons it's less about the present (i.e. 1950) than it is about the past, the strongest scenes are the ones which place themselves most outside any particular era, Wilder was a writer and director with enough hard-headedness to distance himself from anything - and for all that, Sunset Boulevard is one of his weaker films, precisely because the worm of self-reference DOES eat away at it, at least a little bit.  In any event, Sunset Boulevard is the BEST that can happen.  A more likely result is something like The Player, which is ENTIRELY about contemporary Hollywood, and has been so eaten away by the little worm of self-reference that there's nothing left.  It might as well be its own making of documentary.  (Indeed, making of documentaries themselves prove my point they're only of the slightest interest when they're made by outsiders looking in, and these days they never are.)Celebrity is more fortunate than The Player, but the little worm has left Woody Allen with a hollower than usual script.  Even Manhattan Murder Mystery had more substance.  Luckily, the central character (played by Kenneth Branagh) is NOT a celebrity, and it's the clash between his work OUTSIDE Hollywood (the novel) and those sections of his private life that are also outside Hollywood, that generate what interest there is.  The image that sticks in my mind is the climax of this conflict, set down at the docks - I suspect you, too, will have difficulty remembering much else.  This scene alone inclines me to think that the film is, in the end, good, but all the same it IS Allen at his weakest.P.S.  Someone else wrote Why black and white?  If a movie has mundane scenes like Celebrity, then why not shoot it in color?  Because if it had been shot in colour, it would have been just as appropriate to ask Why colour?  If a movie has mundane scenes like Celebrity, then why not shoot it in black and white?  Just because colour is the industry default doesn't mean it should be treated as such.  Obviously, a work in black and white should USE the medium, and Celebrity does fall short of Manhattan - but it doesn't fail to realise the potential of black and white nearly so badly as most modern films fail to realise the potential of colour.

At first I found this slightly irritating but I soon settled back to enjoy it. I was uncertain as to how his character was supposed to illustrate the pros and cons of being a celebrity since he is only a newspaper feature writer with very little public visibility. Consequently, it is not really clear why so many beautiful women throw themselves at him. I think this film is really a cautionary tale about the consequences of infidelity. Lee (Kenneth Branagh) is a serial philanderer who is always willing to abandon a relationship on the promise of something that may be better or newer. He walks out of a 15-year marriage with Robin because he wants to play the field. He gets involved in a relationship with Bonnie that is successful both personally and professionally but he gives it up for the promise of something new in the shape of Nola. Counterpointing Lee's descent into the abyss is Robin's rise from neurotic ex-wife to blissfully married successful television personality. Judy Davis as Robin is always a joy to see in any film, even though she does go several miles over the top in this one. She just cannot believe how happy she has become and concludes that happiness is just a question of luck. In this film it is just that but it does not make a very convincing thesis.This is masterly filmmaking by anyone's standards but because it came after Deconstructing Harry and because it is not quite the tour de force of that film, some critics have expressed disappointment. To me that reaction is churlish. This is a fascinating, funny, thought provoking film by a master at the height of his powers. It is understated, fast moving, subtle and literate with a script that must be about 10 times the length of the average Hollywood production. I would particularly pick out the scene where Lee and Nola eye each other across a crowded restaurant table and they know that they are going to start an affair. The hand-held camera circles slowly around the guests, everyone is talking except Lee and Nola, who just look at each other.I also enjoyed the scene where Robin visits a hooker in order to have lessons on performing felatio. The hooker demonstrates on a banana, accidentally bites into it and ends up choking herselfThe film is nicely framed by an opening scene of a skywriter writing Help in the New York sky as part of a film-shoot and ends with a disconsolate Lee, at the premiere of the film watching the same scene.Celebrity seems to have had a greater commercial success than Deconstructing Harry, probably because of a small role played by Leonardo da Caprio as a hellraising film star. For once the music is rather disappointing, even the Billie Holliday song is one of her less memorable numbers.

It starts out slow and doesn't appear to go very far by the end.  It is sad to say, but I could have told you who wrote this movie without seeing the credits.  Many of the talented cast play a stereotypical Woody Allen role.  At least now I know for sure, that Woody Allen writes the way he acts.  I could not even enjoy this movie on a cultural level and feel that the movie industry has really let down the viewer by allowing it to be made.

His brilliant days are over. but not in a quiet way. but in an embarrassing attempt to defend his own celebrity, his own decline and his scandals (which don't concern me). I felt so sorry for K Branagh playing woody even though he did a great job of imitation without overplaying it. when woody was in his prime he did a film called Stardust Memories that touched on similar themes. His cruelty and disgust for his audiences and what he thinks are normal people was evident but his film-making and writing overcame the faults and it's still a valuable movie to see. but celebrity made me wince.

I couldn't get half way through this one. Robin Simon's and Doug McGrath's Woody Allen impersonations were very irritating. Can you say overdone? Why would a good director like Woody Allen direct his stars to do bad impersonations of himself?Most of Allen's movies have a throwaway scene or two that degenerate into his nervous stream of consiousness, but this film's main two characters just rambled on like 2 mental patients. Sweet 'n Lowdown and Bullets Over Broadway had those moments that reeked of leftover standup material. They detracted from the flow of the movies but were over quickly. All of Celebrity is made up of one 2-hour long such moment.I didn't even see Leonardo DiCaprio to criticize him. Halfway through, I caught myself realizing that the two neurotic victims would just get back together in the end, and I was simply waiting for that to happen. I bailed.Maybe this film could use some quality kills. And a couple of flesh-eating zombies.Sad. "}]
