[{"Title":"Trivia question what is the name of the guy that Jason gets the mask from?","Date":"25 June 1999","Score":"39 out of 47 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" There are very few horror films that are like Halloween ( the first one ) and Nightmare on Elm Street ( the first one ). That is, horror films that not only scare, but have a good story and great direction. Steve Miner is obviously not in the same league as Carpenter and Craven, but what he does manage to do is make an effective sequel that is much scarier than the first and next to the final chapter, it is the best and scariest among all the Fridays.This film is laughable in parts, especially in terms of continuity with some of the stories that are told by Chris, but having said that, Steve Miner makes a very atmospheric and very tense film.The film starts off the day after part two ended. We know Jason is still alive because he kills two disgusting people at the beginning that at least establishes Miner's style to come for the rest of the movie. The false scares, the open doors with no one there, the strange noises, the missing props that the character knows she had just a few seconds ago. The beginning is very well done. But again, the continuity and stupidity of movie characters is at all an all time high here. ( A quick example Harold is about 5'6, rotund and clumsy. His wife calls out his name when she sees a well built figure standing behind her sheets at night. This figure is at least 6 feet or more in height and he looks squared, not pear shaped like her husband Harold. Plus, on the television is the news about the massacre the night before saying that the killer has not been caught. DUUUHHH!! Should this not click into her brain that who she is seeing may be Jason? )But what is excellent about this film are some of the same elements that made Halloween good. And that is the use of foreground for false scares. There are numerous times when the camera scans the for-ground and you are so sure that Jason is going to show up, and then he doesn't until whammo, someone loses an eye or their life. It is very effective. There are also numerous shots of Jason in the background waiting for his next victim to turn around to see him. And when we see him standing behind one stoner guy, his pure size really makes him menacing. And that mask....How he gets the mask is one of the great trivia questions in Friday the 13th folklore.Steve Miner did a masterful job of directing and why he decided to hand the reins over to Joseph Zito for the final chapter is a mysteryAs Fridays go, this is one that you can't go wrong with. It also has ( I believe ) one of the five most gruesome and painful deaths in the series. Watch for Andy walking on his hands, it will make you cringe for quite a while.Edit The new remastered edition in 3-D is worth seeing. I found the 3-D to be entertaining in some parts and lacklustre in others, but there is some added footage in the deluxe edition. You get to see more of Fox hanging from the barn and in a truly jaw dropping moment, you get to see all of Andy, chopped up after he gets split in two walking on his hands. In the original version, you just see a glimpse of him as his blood drips onto the magazine, but now, you see his blood, his legs severed, and much more. I would say this alone makes the purchase worth it.Answer to the question Shelly "},{"Title":"The Hockey Mask Is Here!","Date":"14 January 2006","Score":"24 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" I liked this sequel. Yes, it's stupid, but it's a guilty pleasure thing. A van load of stupid twentysomethings head up to Crystal Lake for the weekend for no other purpose than to smoke pot and screw each other cross eyed. Among them are the painfully unattractive Shelly who enjoys immature practical jokes, a newly pregnant girl, a hippie couple who are constantly ensconced in a cloud of pot smoke and the emotionally damaged Chris, who loves Crystal Lake but has terrible memories of it. It seems that, some time ago, Chris was attacked in the woods by a man with a terribly deformed face. During the attack she passed out and woke up the next morning, safe in her own bed at home. She is not entirely convinced that it was all a dream, and so decides that a weekend at her former haven may just be what she needs to deal with the past. Unfortunately, it was not a dream, as all of us already knew. The man who attacked her was Jason Voorhees, and no sooner do the kids settle in and start partying and screwing than he shows up, ready for some post-coital killings. First to go is an obnoxious trio of motorcycle thugs who harassed our heroes. Then Jason gets right down to what he does best - stabbing, skewering, bisecting and impaling anyone who is stupid enough to wander off alone and wait for him to approach.Still, I liked this movie. Jason finally gets to don his signature hockey mask in this one, and I love the ending, when the rotted remains of Mother Voorhees rise from the lake in a nod to the first films shock ending. I'm still not sure how Mother Voorhees got her head back on, but who cares? This isn't a movie you're supposed to think about too much. I also love Jason's unmasked face in this one. A friend of mine succinctly pointed out the fact that he looks like the banjo player from Deliverance all grown up. A scene at films end when his deranged piggy face appears in a window is actually rather shocking. Dana Kimmel does as good a job as she can with the character of Chris, although Chris is not given a whole hell of a lot to do other than scream, act like a whiny wimp and run. Yeah, this movie is stupid, but its harmless fun. It's not as bad as some of the sequels that followed it, believe me.

The cinema was packed, the screening sold out and the audience absolutely loved it. Every scare worked, the 3D effects leaped right off the screen and lovingly poked us in the eye and when the film was over it got the longest applause I've ever seen a film get. For those pretentious cynics who think that the Friday the 13th films are not great then there's nothing like a 350+ audience to prove you wrong.Since this film was in 'polarised' 3D (see-thru glasses instead of a red-blue blur)then it's not possible to transfer the effect to DVD. Besides, nothing beats seeing this on the big screen with Jason's face 10-feet tall and his massive hands reaching out for you. If there is EVER a 3D screening of this then you really ought to go see, even if you have to sell your own grandmother for a ticket.

But now, after seeing it again on DVD, I have changed my mind about the movie. It isn't that bad.The film starts with a recap of the last scene from Part 2, where Jason is seen getting up after he is assumed dead. Then the movie begins, with a funky and upbeat 80's background song starting the film. Right after the song ends, Jason begins his killing spree, starting with two unsuspecting store owners, and then moving on to unsuspecting teens at a small farm area...The thing I like about this movie is the fact that Jason first gets his trademark hockey mask in this movie. The mask is a big improvement over the sack from part 2, and makes Jason look much scarier.Another good thing about this movie is Dana Kimmell. Although her lines & dialog in the film are somewhat cheesy at some points, her character is very convincing as the teen heroine. And whenever she's frightened, she screams the cutest scream ever. I loved how she screamed in the film; she was cute and funny at the same time! A bad part of the movie is the fact that the rest of the characters are unlikable. The teens are generally stupid and naive, and the biker gang are very mean-spirited. Those characters are so unlikable that you will really want Jason to kill them all.Another bad thing Some viewers might be disappointed that they cannot see the film in its actual 3D format. I myself would have liked to see the movie's 3D effects.Overall, Dana Kimmell and Jason save the movie from being bad. You have to hear Dana's screams to know how cute she is. And you must watch this movie in order to know how Jason gets his hockey mask.I give this movie a 7/10.

This time Jason leaves Camp Crystal Lake and heads to an unknown destiny, which later turns to be Higgins Haven. On his way to the haven Jason murders Harold and Edna (the owners / attendants) of a rural K-Mart like store. This time Jason's unlucky victims include Chris Higgins (owner of the haven), Rick, Chuck, Chilli, Shelly, Debbie, Andy, Vera, and a gang of motorcycle bikers Ali, Fox, Loco. Highlights of the movie Jason and the bikers, Chris revealing to Rick about her previous encounter with Jason (not knowing it was him), Chuck watching Jason thinking it's a hallucination, Andy's death, and of course , Jason getting his trademark mask; and at last but not least the great funky groovy opening theme. This tune added some humor to the tension felt towards the beginning of the carnage.Friday 3 came in the right moment when the slasher genre was at it's peak. After the box office success of part 2, this sequel was a coming on. This movie has plenty of gore, suspense, and some good scare scenes.The acting is regular, the best performance comes from Dana Kimmell.Jason looks menacing, big, and surely very angry. Richard Brooker portrayed Jason in a good way, he knows how to act violent and looks like he's blood thirsty. This time the teens aren't as smart as in the previous film, still I liked some of them. Shelly was a good character, although he was annoying you felt sorry for him at the end. Rick was an unlikeable character, he seemed tough but in the end he couldn't even fight Jason. Debbie's pregnancy was overlooked, I guess that Jason didn't know he killed an unborn. What the heck, even if he knew about it he would still kill Debbie. Andy's death is by far the best in the movie, and one of the best s in the series. Chuck and Chilli (who aren't exactly teens) had potential, but in a 90 minute slasher movie you can't get much character development. The gang situation was unnecessary, I mean there was a lot of hype about a possible confrontation between these guys and Jason. The ending of the movie is great! The chasing scene is the best in the series (even better than part 2's). Jason seemed angry and desperate to kill Chris, who wasn't by no means braver than Ginny but still manged to give some fight to Jason. Unmasked Jason looked frightening, specially if you consider that Jason's unmasked look from part 2 wasn't that creepy at all. Unlike the Jason from part 2 this Jason seems to be invincible, the producers probably wanted to create a Jason that would impose respect, and create fear among the other characters.Miner's direction is still good. This is where part III didn't improve from the 2nd. movie. Miner's job in part 2 is magnificent, probably the best (apart from part VI) in the series. Still, Miner shows his talent in creating a scary, and dark setting.Friday the 13th part III3D is a good horror movie, the 3rd. installment in the series is worth a rental for horror fans and if you are a die hard of the series -like me- then you should buy it even IF it isn't the uncut version on DVD. I'm sure that this movie is more effective in the fear factor if you watch it on 3-D. Sadly, it isn't available in that format.Give a try to this flick even if you're not a Friday the 13th fan, it's surely a great slasher flick. Not the best in the series but delivers some good scares, gore, a cool theme, and a hockey masked Jason!.4/10 8/10 in the Friday the 13th scale.

You have to judge a film based on what it set out to do, and decide whether it met that goal or not. I don't think it's fair to judge these films by the same criteria as The Godfather or something.If you go into this movie just expecting to have fun, you won't be disappointed. The story is essentially the same as every other Friday film, with a minor twist this time it takes place on a little ranch owned by one of the main characters. Jason, fresh off his killing spree in part 2, makes his way across the countryside to find a new batch of hormonal kids vacationing at Crystal Lake. Of course, this time it looks nothing like the Crystal Lake from the previous two films, seeing as it was filmed on a ranch in California instead of New Jersey, but oh well.The kids are all walking stereotypes--pretty much the only way to give them any characterization in a 90-minute movie that has to dispatch one of them every ten minutes. There's a pair of stoners that look older than the rest of the cast and make you question what they're even doing there, a hefty practical joker, and a couple expecting a baby of all things. But they all manage to be likable enough, and thankfully there is no one irritating enough to make you wish they would die already. There is no mean girl or jerk; they all seem to be friends, which is nice.Jason gets his hands on the famous hockey mask in this installment, courtesy of one dead joker. The kills are the most creative in the series thus far, obviously taking advantage of the original 3D format this was released in back in 1982 one character's eyeball pops out at the screen in what must have been a pretty cool gag in 3D, an unlucky guy doing a handstand gets split in two, and a harpoon gun is put to deadly use.The highlight of the film is the chase sequence in the final act. The Friday films are known for some of the most entertaining chase scenes, and this one is no exception. It starts out in a cabin and goes all over the place from there, with Jason pursuing our terrified heroine relentlessly. Jason is actually creepy in this film--some form of degenerate who runs (not walks) after his victims with something approaching excitement. Wait until you see him unmasked later in the film--clearly he is not feeling burdened by his work.This is a perfect movie to put on with friends. It's entertaining, fun, and you'll have a blast watching these goof-balls bite it in interesting ways. You'll laugh at the dialogue, chuckle at some of the acting, and jump at some of the scares. So order a pizza, grab some beer, and just sit back and enjoy.

I also thought the character developement was better than the first two (yes, I know character developement and slasher movies aren't birds of a feather, but I though it worked in this particular slasher).  I actually became attached to some of the characters and didn't want them them to die. Most people, however, think the time spent developing characters slowed the pace and made the movie boring.  This was also the first Friday the 13th movie to have it's climax in a barn. I thought the fact that it took place on a ranch was kind of neat, I was getting kind of tired of camp.Most of the death scenes were original, the gore level was average, not a whole lot of suspense (but what do you expect?

One of the better aspects here is the exceptionally high body count which generates plenty of gory, blood-soaked goodness during it's time with a rather wide assortment of weaponry, delivering with the bloody goods impaling people on staffs, knifes, and many other sharp objects as to be expected during a film as this. There's even an all-time favorite in the infamous handstand kill, which is part of the charm with unique and fantastic kills, as all the killings are great to a degree and is pretty chilling. As well, the film manages to get plenty of fun in its traditional slasher moments as there's a ton of incredibly suspenseful moments in this, from the barnyard massacre of the biker group as the group continually reaches another level to find one of their members killed unexpectedly, to the different stalking tactics against the friends in the house. Those are incredibly fun, with the lakeside ambush, the attack on the post-coital couple upstairs hallway and then taking out the remaining group as the last couple arrives and then parts of the final chase throughout here, which is a highlight effort of grand style here. it's lengthy, gets in numerous close encounters and provides the kind of high-quality stalking, chasing, close-encounters and battling that runs through the house, out into the woods and back into the barn for one of the best parts here, though in the end this segment also highlights part of the film's problems. The fact that, what should be the biggest sequence is instead merely presented as a tired retread of the other two in the manner of knocking him down then failing to press the advantage in order to hide and do it all over again, which makes this one of the lesser examples of the style. Also problematic is the 3D effects here are just plain ludicrous, with the examples coming across as just stupid as the tactic itself geared toward finding the stupidest possible examples to accomplish the feat as possible, getting yo-yos, popping popcorn, flung wallets, juggled fruit and more flung towards the camera that has no bearing on the plot and they all stick out quite obviously. The last problem here is the film's pacing, which is off and quite drags at places as the beginning is endlessly overlong with the massacred couple who are completely unworthy of being focused upon for way too long, the meeting-the-friends is too short and is over too quickly, while the middle section is bogged down with the irritating ploy of her trying to get her past out only to constantly force herself not to then try again and repeat the process. Once we finally get the flashback, which was an important part of the movie, was handled very weirdly as instead of the usual flashback where the character narrates over the action that is happening on screen, we see a silhouette of her face over the action, completely blurring the scene which reveals itself to make no sense in the grand scheme of things, leaving it utterly tiring quite quickly. These here really lower this one in the series.Rated R Graphic Violence, Brief Nudity, Adult Language and drug use.

It's just so darn entertaining, you can't help but love it.No, the acting isn't even approaching Oscar territory, and the story is basically a re-tread of the first two, but so what? The strength of these films is their sensible, straight-forward approach. They're just meant to be fun, and this one certainly is.For those interested in the plot, this time Jason sets his sights on a group of young adults spending the weekend at a friend's cottage, which just happens to be situated on--yes, you guessed it Crystal Lake.The fun begins almost immediately as we meet two of cinema's quirkiest general store owners who unwittingly fall victim to a very much alive Jason as he vacates the scene of the last entry's bloodbath (and searches for some new clothes).We then pick up with our core group of fun-loving kids who, among other things, enjoy activities such as sex, playing practical jokes, and smoking pot. Despite all of this, they manage to remain surprisingly likable--probably the most approachable cast in the series. I could see myself being friends with these guys.Once Jason makes his way to the ranch, the blood-letting ensues. We even get a fun sequence involving leather-clad bikers who venture onto Jason's land in search of revenge following a grocery store incident with two of the main characters.From start to finish, the film stays entertaining throughout, ending with one of the series' best finales, as Jason chases his unfortunate final victim all over the place, giving us lots of thrills and scares along the way.It's also worth mentioning that this is the first film in which Jason dons the now infamous hockey mask. And let's just say his first on-screen appearance while wearing it is pretty memorable.Originally shot in 3D, the film contains plenty of obvious 3D gags with things popping out at the screen, lending an even cheesier, entertaining vibe to the entire experience.Ignore the recycled plot and the hammy acting--just have fun with this film--the way it was intended.

We soon meet a group of teenagers, led by Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell), who are going out to the lake for some summer fun. Jason meanwhile is hiding out in the Higgins barn watching the teens every move. Eventually some members of a biker gang decide to check out the barn when Jason strikes. He also gets his infamous hockey mask in this sequel which has become a trademark for the horror genre. Many of the teens are murdered, and it's up to Chris to battle the evil madman.Part three was originally presented in 3-D back in 1982. I would have loved to see it in the theatre, watching on your TV screen doesn't do it justice. This part was a very good addition to the series. It carried on a continuous story of Jason stalking residents of Crystal Lake over a period of a few days. Having Part 3 take place the day after Amy Steel's Ginny battle Jason in part 2 was pretty cool. Jason Vorhees looks different in this one than he did in the second one. Potato sack and hockey mask aside, his face was very different. His face/head were shaved and he looked inhuman. In the second Friday, he looked like some backwoods grizzly type man. In Part 3, he looks like a mutation of some kind.Dana Kimmell is amazing. That's all I can say. I loved her portrayal of Chris Higgins and her battle and chase scenes with Jason were the best of the series next to Amy Steel's in part 2. And one cannot overlook that this is the movie where Jason gets his legendary hockey mask thanks to Shelley and his assortment of costumes/makeup he brings on the trip.

I rate it really bad though on the anaglyph transfer. Finally we get a home 3D version of the film released by Paramount. Obviously though Paramount had more than one person working on the transfer since some of the scenes work and some fall flat on their face. Anaglyph (Red-blue) means the images have to be presented side to side. Some of the scenes in the opening of the film are correct but some are obviously transferred into anaglyph in over-under anaglyph which just doesn't work. Also, when you present an anaglyph film you have to increase the contrast on the DVD so people can see an image through a dark filter. That wasn't done here. Instead we get a dark image which is hard enough for the human eye to see. Next gripe is that Paramount used the original over-under negative which shows horrible grain in both the 3d and 2d versions of the film. May as well watch this on an old 8mm projector. Glad to have a 3D release but get people that know what they are doing to transfer the film. Making an over-under film into anaglyph doesn't work because that isn't how people's eyes work. Also, if you are going to call it a delux edition, include a few extras. This DVD doesn't even include a chapter card and no extras at all. Typically Paramount.

Tagging along are the requisite body count; nymphet, jock, stoner, nerd and way-too-old boyfriend. You know, the disparate people that make up every group of friends. Beginning right where Part 2 left off (how else could we follow the plot without a reset?), Miner attempts to give the series a narrative thread, a concept that goes south quickly with subsequent entries. Shot in 3D for its initial release, Part 3 is far more playful and better directed then the bulk of the Jason films. The 3D forces Miner to play with perspective and composition in more interesting, artful ways than in previous film. This entry also bears the distinction of being the origin of the iconic Jason, the hockey-masked, machete-wielding, disfigured psychopath that has become a permanent figure in horror pop- culture. Stealing a goalie mask from one of his victims, Jason is allowed more room in front of the camera, the series finally finding a really effective way of utilizing his movements on screen, than merely having him stalk around the edges of the frame. Here, Jason hasn't yet become the immortal slasher monster, his movements and reactions far more humanoid. He reacts to pain, limps and verbalizes injury, moves at different speeds (in contrast to his latter singular, lumbering zombie state) and is even given screen time with his face visible and expressive. This makes Miner's Jason the most terrifying of his incarnations, as he appears to occupy the same plain of existence as his victims. Miner takes his time actually developing his victims, and then begins to dispatch them with staccato bursts of violence, rather than prolonged, detailed gore. His most significant directorial decision is to overlay Christine's flashback scene, with her telling the tale presently. This creates a Godardian visual rift in the film, so purely cinematic and bizarre. Employing goofy 3D antics such as popcorn popping, yo-yo's, juggling and harpoons in the eye, Part 3 is by far the best sequel in the entire series (with X being the nadir). Here, Miner attempts to wrap up the Crystal Lake saga in a narratively cohesive manner, long before Jason goes to Hell, or Manhattan, or Space.

My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's Friday the 13th Part V A New Beginning on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer&#x97;who increasingly becomes an infernal monster&#x97;just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Jason Voorhees that especially sets Friday the 13th apart from similar franchises.The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduces a campy element with Part III, which pretty much plagues the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway. Still, this is the main detriment of Part III, released in 1982. The opening credits song tips the viewer off that this isn't a wholly serious horror film (like the first two), which is compounded when a couple of the protagonists meet some sinister bikers at a convenience store in the boonies, which takes place about 25 minutes into the story. These hoodlums are too cartoony to take serious and so it's hard to take the horror of the story serious as well. This doesn't mean it's not an entertaining installment, just that it's my least favorite.Another noticeable difference between Part III and the two previous films is that, although the story takes place in the area of Crystal Lake, the film was shot on the West Coast instead of the East Coast, specifically Santa Clarita, CA, and nearby Melody Ranch (where the barn is located). The geography is obviously dryer, but this won't make much of an impact on most viewers and, besides, it is a nice change of pace from the first two movies.As usual, the film features a nice assortment of young women &#x96; three white girls, a Hispanic and a black woman, the latter being the biker chick, Fox. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the main protagonist, Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, is probably it, followed by the stoner chick, Chili. Debbie and Vera are also on hand.Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but&#x97;with the exception of the 2009 reboot&#x97;I don't find these movies particularly scary, although they have loads of jump scares. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary, for me anyway. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.BOTTOM LINE Part III is another entertaining segment in the series and it's notable for switching the filming locations to dry Southern California, not to mention Jason is bigger and more imposing than in Part II and he finally acquires his iconic hockey mask, but Part III is my least favorite of the franchise due to the overt goofy elements.The film runs 95 minutes.GRADE C+ "},{"Title":"Misunderstood Entry.

Steve Miner again is at the helm , and frankly he does a great job. Right away with part 3 the standout difference from the others is the use of 3D. Some see the use of 3D as cheesy , in fact a lot of the time that is the truth. Yet with the slasher genre I believe it fits in quite nicely. The effects in this film were very top notch for the time period. Now onto the story. This is not a new group of counselors , this is not at Camp Crystal Lake. The setting is an area on the lake but that of a farm if you will called Higgins Haven. Part of me wants to dislike this idea because the campgrounds as a setting with the woods was flawless. However , this setting has grown on me. It is still a wooded area and we still have some horny young adults looking for a getaway weekend. There are a few things that I personally felt we could do without in terms of the story. In the beginning there is a flashback to the ending of part 2 ,this then leads to a couple who own a grocery store. The couple are very random , and granted both kills are good they just seem as unnecessary characters.One thing I noticed in this film is when Chris (Dana Kimmel)has her flashback it is almost implied that Jason was going to assault or rape her. I just don't know if that is what was intended or not but I find it unnecessary. I really enjoyed the addition of the biker gang. They made the story interesting and brought some freshness with their attitudes. The kills in this film are a bit tame as far as blood goes. However , a few of my favorite kills by Jason are in this film. The first being the spear-gun kill , the second being Rick's head being squeezed until his eyeball pops out in 3D, and lastly Andy's kill might just be the best F13th kill. Walking on his hands , then being split in half was a crazy thing to see. This film was much more intense as Miner showed us in part 2. He wanted to make the film suspenseful , terrifying and gory. I think he was quite successful with this formula. If you get a chance both versions 2D and 3D are worth watching please note that a widescreen formula does this film so much more justice. So stop waiting , grab the popcorn, and enjoy this film as Jason makes his way from the screen into your living room.

The opening sequence (excluding the ending from Friday the 13th Part II which was put in there originally to remind people in the theaters of what happened last time since the movie hadn't been released on VHS) is slow and builds tension. It was the best part of the whole movie. It was then that I thought...hey, maybe this movie isn't going to be so bad after all. The tension buildup was agonizing. I knew the couple was going to buy it...it was a question of when. From there, it seemed the movie just lost the road and came down the embankment. The only somewhat lovable character that anyone has any sympathy for is Chris...and seeing how she turned out at the end of the movie seemed to make sense after all she'd been through, but since the movie sucked it probably would've been more appropriate to have Chris traumatized but not a babbling laughing lunatic. After the opening sequence, typical slasher/splatter movie format takes over. Semi-likable characters, some with unusual talents or personalities (all the better to kill them with), simply there because they're going to be killed. What was up with Shelly. Did he turn out that way because he was named Shelly? I'd be bitter toward my parents if they had named me Shelly. The homage to Psycho (and I took it as somewhat of an homage to Halloween, too, after all Steve Miner was directing and he went on to direct Halloween H20) where the guy gets killed while going downstairs to get a beer for his girlfriend after having sex with her. The homage to Psycho comes with her in the shower. And what was up with the biker gang, and the big black dude, who was the leader, at the end seemingly coming back to life to get back at Jason right when he's going to kill Chris? That was messed up. And why, when she had the opportunity at the end with the ax, wouldn't Chris just chop Jason's head off!!! I'd gladly do it if I was in her position. If some lunatic comes after me in an attempt to kill me, he'd better hope he gets the job done, that's all I'm saying.

When Chris and Rick return, Rick is killed and Chris battles Jason with the brief assistance of one of the bikers from town who came to the farm to get revenge on the teens who upset him earlier. But Jason, like he did to the other two bikers, kills him and Chris, in turn, kills Jason. And like the dream sequence in Part 1, Chris goes insane when she dreams someone has jumped from the lake and brings her underwater. This time, it's not Jason, but a decomposed Pamela Voorhees, with head reattached!

It also introduced the iconic hockey mask that Jason wears for the rest of the series and the characters are good but boy I hate Shelly however the film has great kills even one of my favourite involving a harpoon going though one of the charters eye which would have looked brilliant in 3-D. The 3-D in the film was a big marketing point and the score was fantastic and just really catchy.Now the film starts of right after the end of part 2 with Jason killing two randoms people and then making his way to crystal lake. The teens then make there way to the camp and Shelly just happens pranking the main characters like 10 times in the film and am glad it comes back to bite him in the ass later on. So they end up getting in trouble with a biker gang which end up going after them then they end up getting killed. So at the end Jason gets hung and dies until the sequel.So I would watch part 3 it's a fun horror film and the first good one.

"},{"Title":"A Familiar Plot Shown in 3D","Date":"4 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" This movie essentially begins with a group of young men and women who decide to ignore the warnings and spend some time in the woods at Camp Crystal Lake. Also involved are three motorcycle punks who are upset with them after a confrontation at a local convenience store and want to get even in the worst possible way. What none of them realize is that Jason is still alive and well&#x97;and waiting for them. Now, if this plot seems slightly familiar then it's because it is the third time it has been used and like Jason the producers simply brush it off and begin again. However, what makes this movie somewhat unique is that it was filmed in 3-D in order to enhance the effect at local theaters. Unfortunately, what the movie producers may not have counted on was that this movie was released during the height of the VCR craze and as a result audiences were just as likely to see this movie on a television screen than anywhere else. As a result, some of the special effects geared for 3-D may have fallen a little flat. Another interesting fact about this movie is that it is the first time that Jason dons his iconic hockey mask as previously he used a burlap bag over his head similar to the psychopath in The Town that Dreaded Sundown. In any case, even though the plot followed the standard path of the Friday the 13th films preceding it still managed&#x97;along with the Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street series&#x97;to attract huge audiences and rake in millions of dollars during the decade of the 80's. That being the case, who can argue with success? Yet despite everything just mentioned there really isn't that much here, in my mind, that separates this movie from countless other slasher films of this type. And it hasn't aged well. Accordingly, I rate it as about average. "},{"Title":"Jason's back for a turd. A one-dimensional 3D horror of a film.","Date":"13 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Friday the 13th is one of the highest grossing horror franchise in the United States, nevertheless, it's Friday the 13th Part III, where it become very crystal clear that the film series to starting to get stupid. Directed by Steve Miner, and originally release in 3-D, Friday the 13th Part III is the first movie to feature the antagonist Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) with his iconic signature hockey mask, which has since become a trademark of both the character and franchise as a whole. As a direct sequel to 1980's Friday the 13th & 1981's Friday the 13th Part 2, the first part of the film follows the aftermath of the massacres at Camp Crystal Lake, very loosely. We see a recap of the last minutes of the previous film through archive footage. However, it doesn't really fit well, with the rest of this film, since that part wasn't shot in 3D. Other glaring factors is that none of the previous cast, return for this film. Not even, Amy Steel as Ginny Field, who surprising, was never even kill by Jason. I guess, they didn't want to do the Ginny at psychiatric hospital route, since 1981's Halloween 2 kinda did it first. Instead, the movie focus on a new batch of teenagers lead by Chrissy Higgins (Dana Kimmell) in a new location, Higgins Haven trying to have some vacation time, before the new school year on surprising Sunday, the 15th, not Friday the 13th. I wasn't impressed with any of the actors acting here. It was a bit jarring to see, mid 30s somethings, trying to act like teens. Not only that; unlike the other film, where most of the supporting characters were likable. Most of them in this movie, weren't likable! They were all, highly obnoxious! First off, you got Rick (Paul Kraka) whom loves, surprising and forcing sex on supposedly rape victims. Then you got the over-the-top Cheech & Chong rip-off, stoner, Charles 'Chuck Garth (David Katims) who looks like, he has step into the wrong set! Then you got the cheesy Michael Jackson's 'BAD' looking motorcycle gang that really had, no purpose in the film, just to serve as filler. Then you got the guy, Andy Beltrami (Jeffery Rodgers) and his pregnant girlfriend, Debbie Klein (Tracie Savage) whom gimmick was it, to walk on his hands. Then you got Debbie, whom I really don't know, why they had to try to kill her and unborn child. I guess, the producers really hated, teen pregnancies. Then you got the really horrible character, Shelly Finkelstein (Larry Zerner), whom I didn't like him, at all! He really ruins the film for me. Does he have mental problems or something!? Who does mean pranks like that!? Are you sure, this movie wasn't made as a comedy, because they all, look like a joke! The only person, besides Chrissy that was somewhat decent was Vera Sanchez (Catherine Parks) who had an eye on things. Honestly, for the most part, I wanted all of them to die, quick. It's a bad sign, if you cheer for the bad guy, more than the good guys. Anyways, the movie is full of silly 3-D gimmicks. We get to see, a number of mundane 3-D effects from Yo-Yo being tossed at us to juggling tricks. It seemed like they were really stretching, when coming up with ideas on how to use the 3-D in this film. Still, there were a number of really cool shots that was worth seeing, such as the harpoon gun or pitchfork scene. Still, some of the deaths in the film were edited in order to avoid an X rating, and you really can tell, where the cuts ends. The film also contains an infamous alternate ending in which the lead character Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, is decapitated by Jason at the conclusion. Though this sequence has never been commercially released, stills of it can be seen. Still, the ending, they did choose, was very lackluster, with all the fake-outs dream sequences. Despite all the blood and gore, this movie lacks the suspense, compare to the previous two. I really didn't find, the movie to be, that scary. After all, the movie has a funky disco soundtrack by Harry Manfredini that sounds like a Halloween dance-off party and lots of nudity that give anybody, a chubby. When first released, the film was intended to end the series as a trilogy. However unlike its sequel Friday the 13th Part IV The Final Chapter (1984) and the later film, Jason Goes to Hell The Final Friday (1993), Friday the 13th Part III did not include a moniker in its title to indicate it as such. Overall it's one of the films, you have to watch at least once, if you into the 1980's horror genre. Just don't think too much about it when watching. It's just one of those films you watch if you want cheap thrills, nothing more.

I only know Savage because she was a newscaster in Dayton, Ohio when I was growing up. This movie brings it, especially when Chris tells her story to Paul about her 1st encounter with Jason. The Lake scene at the end was a added surprise also, it will make some jump. It still makes my skin crawl, but not like the ending in the 1st one. This is not a bad sequel at all, in fact I prefer Part 3 over the Final Chapter. The 3-D effects are good; but they are nothing compared to today's 3-D magic.

Jason meanwhile is hiding out in the Higgins barn watching the teens every move. Eventually, some members of a biker gang decide to check out the barn when Jason strikes.He also gets his infamous hockey mask in this sequel which has become a trademark for the horror movie genre. Many of the teenagers are murdered, and it's up to Chris to battle the evil madman.This film was originally presented in 3-D back in 1982. I would have loved to see this movie in 3D, but I was born in 1998 and I did not know anything about movies when I was young, but now I do.The hockey mask is why I put Jason Voorhees on my Top 10 Horror Movie Villains list and because of the way he kills his victims is just amazing. In the first and second Friday the 13th, he did not wear that hockey ask, but in the third film, he finally got the hockey mask.Dana Kimmel is amazing and the rest of the actors are just amazing. The ending to this film is a little odd, but most of the time in Friday the 13th movies, the endings can be very confusing, but in scary movies, the killers' living eye must snap open.If not, how can you make a sequel? A prequel? A interquel? Or a remake, reboot or a trilogy? If you want to keep the money flowing in, you have to keep the killer alive.Overall, Friday THE 13th - PART III is awesome and I give it an 8 out of 10. "},{"Title":"A flawed but hugely enjoyable film","Date":"10 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" The film is not as well paced in its first hour as the second film and it suffers from poor casting in the leads. Dana Kimmell, who plays Chris Higgins, is nowhere near good enough of an actress to play the lead role in any film and Paul Kafka, who plays Rick, can't act to save his life. His next on screen role wasn't for another 24 years, which isn't terribly surprising. Both of the film's supporting female stars, Tracie Savage and in particular Catherine Parks, would have been much better as Chris while Jeffrey Rogers should have probably been cast as Rick instead of Andy. The characters are all likable and some of them even seem like real people but I have to say that the bikers were more interesting! One thing that really bothered me about the film though was the fact that the Wild Bunch as they like to call themselves decide that it's a good idea to holiday within a few miles at most of an extraordinarily brutal murder spree which left eight people the day before and the killer is still at large, which is reported on the news at the beginning of this film. I suppose that you could argue that they didn't hear about it since they never mention it but that seems a bit far- fetched considering how extensively comparable events in real life are reported in the media. Failing that, have they no parents, friends or siblings who would have heard about the massacre with the good sense to warn them not to go? Besides which, you would think that the police would have the entire area cordoned off as Jason is still at large. In the previous film, the filmmakers at least had the good sense to move the action forward five years and even then the characters discussed Mrs Voorhees, Jason and the previous massacre.Released during the 3-D craze of the early 1980s, the filmmakers decided that it would be good idea to enhance the audience's illusion of depth perception for the third film. I'm not a big of 3-D but at least we were spared the film being entitled Friday the 13th Part 3-D as was the case with Jaws 3-D and Amityville 3-D, both of which were released in 1983. I think that 3-D is lazy and can be very irritating. I watched the film in 2-D but the fact that the film was shot in 3-D was still very obvious when things like the baseball bat and yo-yo come at the screen for no reason other than the fact that it's a 3-D film.However, I'd no such problem with the numerous scenes of murder, violence and mayhem, many of which were very well done and among the most gruesome to grace the series up to this point. I highly doubt that if I had watched the film in its intended format, I would have enjoyed than any more than I did. In fact, I would probably have enjoyed them less, if I'm perfectly honest.Overall, this is a flawed but nevertheless hugely enjoyable film which comes into its own in its second half, particularly the last half an hour.

A friend of mine had this on video and I was so desperate to own it that I bought it off him for £13 quid out of my pocket money and never looked back. I just loved it and even though I was already a fan of the series, seeing Jason get his infamous hockey mask for the first time just made me smile and just watched it over and over again.Well where do I start, for all those familiar with 1 and 2, then this one will come as no surprise and has all the right ingredients that makes this series work and viewing it again as a grown up, I do view it differently that I used to, I still love it though, even though it's not quite as perfect as I remember it. Firstly the 3D elements just too gimmicky and not used to full effect, and were just a blatant attempt for money grabbing and everything else like story and character development took a back seat. But some of the kill shots were pretty cool.The opening disco music scene which gets a lot of complaints, but personally I love it and justs adds to the cheese factor. But there a few small elements that don't work like the flashback to where Chris got attacked, just seemed muddled and not fully explored and was just thrown in to add more to the thin plot and just felt unnecessary. Then there's the dream sequence ending which just felt rushed and after some research I found out that it was just filmed because they couldn't go with the original intended downbeat ending where the survivor has her head chopped off, which would have been cool, but sadly didn't happen.But the positive aspects like I already said the iconic hockey mask was a genius touch to the proceedings and the death scenes are really cool we getting the eye popping scene which was awesome, spear gun in the eye and a guy chopped in half while doing a handstand was again brilliant. Even though the acting was quite to the level of the first 2 there were still some pretty decent performances. Larry Zerner who plays Shelly is one of the more developed and lovable characters in the franchise, Dana Kimmell plays one of the best final girls in the series, she proves more than a match for Jason, the 80's punks were hit and miss, plus the stoner characters just seemed to be there for the body count, but Richard Brooker who plays Jason definitely stands out as one of the best, bringing a hulking menacing, but human vibe to the character.All in all Friday The 13th Part 3 definitely ranks one of the best in the franchise, just don't expect any substance, it's just brainless popcorn fun with some cool killings.

Friday The 13th Part III doesn't give viewers anything new in the series and gives fans all of the familiar elements that are in Friday The 13th seriesthe young campers,a high body count,blood,gore and last but certainly not least seeing everyone's favorite Summer Camp killer Jason Voorhees doing what he does best for 90 minutes offering fans another marathon of slaying and we as the viewers are entertained and having fun. The kills in Part III are well done and creative and what really adds to the kills is the 3-D effect which makes it seem like your feeling the kills yourself. The blood and gore is also in great effect here because we see human limbs coming off as well a wonderful eyeball gag(you'll see)that is one of most memorable scenes. The atmosphere and look of Part III is one of best in the series especially during the night time scenes which are dark and mysterious and makes the some of the scenes more suspenseful and creepy whether Jason is in the scene or not. The atmosphere also adds to the chase scenes towards the end of the film which is one of the best chase scenes in the entire series and will keep you on the edge of your seat. And what about the main characters in Part III? Some of them are a combination of being interesting and forgettable because let's face characters and depth have never been the Friday The 13th franchises strongest suite because Everyone knows that the main attraction of this series is Jason Voorhees. Jason in Part III is in top form here in this film and is at his creepiest,hiding in the shadows,killing his victims in a vicious fashion in the best way that he knows how like the silent killer that he is stalking and hunting his prey like a shark in the water ready eat it victims and unleash his brutality. Perhaps the most famous scene in the film and in my opinion one of the best scenes in Horror movie history is the introduction of Jason's famous Hockey mask which made Jason not just a Horror icon or a Slasher movie icon but a movie icon in general. Where as Freddy Kruger has the finger claws,red and green sweater and fedora hat and Michael Myers has the white mask and butcher's knife The Hockey mask(along with the machete)helped define Jason and gave the character a symbol that makes Jason Voorhees unforgettable. The ending of Friday The 13th Part III is great and filled with intensity,suspense and surprises that will leave excited and fearful. A terrific ending.The cast is good. Richard Booker is excellent and memorable as Jason Voorhees,with Booker being creepy and intense. RIP Mr. Booker,you were one of the best Jason's. Dana Kimmel is wonderful as Chris,a the main heroine. Paul Krafta does a fine job as Rick,Chris' boyfriend. Tracie Savage and Jeffrey Rogers are good as Debbie and Andy,a couple. Catherine Parks is memorable as Vera,a friend of Chris'. Larry Zerner is funny as Shelly,a practical joker who has a crush on Vera. David Katims and Rachel Howard are Humorous as Chuck and Chili,an older couple. Nick Savage(Ali),Gloria Charles(Fox)and Kevin O'Brian(Loco)are fun and interesting as a Motorcycle gang.The direction by Joseph Zito is great,with Zito giving the movie a dark and moody atmosphere while giving the film a nice pace. Fine direction,Zito.The score by Harry Manfredini is another wonderful,suspenseful and intense score that adds to the film. Great score,Manfredini. I also like the opening Disco theme song that goes with the movie.The Special and Practical Make-up effects are fantastic,well-done and add to the movie. Great Special effects.In final word,if you love Horror Films or the Friday The 13th franchise,I highly suggest you see Friday The 13th Part III,a terrific,entertaining sequel that is one of the best films in the series.

Jason is able to remove the machete from his shoulder and crawl away, moving onto another part of Crystal Lake to find more people to kill.Jason doesn't waste much time finding new victims, and now viewers get an idea of the size of Crystal Lake. Jason moves to another area where his fodder seemingly don't know what's been going on in the area. Even though the setting is still around Crystal Lake, the area has a farm look and feel to it, taking it out of the woods from the first two films and putting things out in the open.Chris, our go-to girl, is taking her friends out to her parents' cabin. She's there to show her friends a good time, and get over a traumatic experience she had there a while ago. On top of that, her old flame is there to spend the weekend with her, giving up a shot to hang with Mary Jo Conrad. Sorry to say Rick, you should have spent the weekend with Mary Jo.We get our usual teenagers here, the pot smokers and practical joker, the sexpots and the serious ones. You could actually point to this movie as having every single teenager cliché in it, before they were clichés. One in particular, the practical joker Shelly, would change the entire face of the franchise, literally. Shelly introduces the world, and Jason, to the fabled hockey mask. A lot of people forget, Jason didn't get the mask until the third film, and boy, did it change the series.By the time the third installment of the franchise came around, the producers had decided to use a gimmick that was making its comeback in the early 80's, 3D. 3D films have existed in some form since 1915, but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film.By the 1950's however, technology had come along well enough that many films used 3D to enjoy plenty of success, and for the most part, the technology worked. However, as with all gimmicks, people got tired of 3D and even though the technology was good, it wasn't perfected. So Hollywood did away with it, and the film industry wouldn't bring it back around until the 1980's.Friday the 13th Part 3 (marketed as Friday the 13th Part 3D) jumped on board the 3D bandwagon but not just for a few scenes in the movie, but rather the entire film. I didn't have the chance to see the film on the big screen, but thanks to HD TVs and the ability to put 3D onto DVDs and Blu Ray, I can get a pretty good idea of what people saw back in the day on the big screen.The deluxe version of the film comes with a 3D copy of the movie and glasses, and I can assure you it does in fact work. Not all of it is perfect however, and some of the effects are quite gimmicky, but there are some things that stick out. There is a depth to the film the entire time, and it looks pretty damn cool. Scenes where trees are blowing in the wind, bugs can be seen flying around, popcorn popping and some other things look great. I mean, it's nothing compared to the 3D movies of today, but you gotta think, 1982 3D technology actually working is pretty damn cool.However, the film really didn't need to be in 3D, and thanks to some of the best shots being centered around 3D, the movie lost a lot of its edge because 2D just doesn't work the same. Some of the kills look really bad in 2D, and that's a shame because I've always found the film to be pretty damn creepy.Steve Miner, who directed part two, did a good job here with the pacing of the film. You get kills every few minutes, plenty of jump scares and of course, Jason finally gets a face. The film uses the creepy vibes from the first two films, and at this point the franchise wasn't completely milked, so the formula works.One of my very few complaints is Jason's appearance from part two to three, and how it changes drastically. In Friday the 13th Part 2, Jason is a small guy with long hair, here he's a big guy who's bald, and yet it's only been a day since part two! I know the reason for the switch to a bigger guy, and I can say that it was actually for the best, but it's an annoying continuity error.Another issue I have with the film is the subplot of Chris being attacked in the woods and coming out to face her fears. We find out the person that attacked her is Jason, and we see this in a flashback sequence. The problem isn't with the idea, the problem is Jason is wearing the same clothes he does in this film, and those clothes he actually gets at the beginning of the movie! Big time error on the filmmakers part.Even with the films issues, the 3D effects that work are cool and Friday 3 brings everything you could want. A little sex, a lot of kills, and Jason finally gets his face. Oh, and a funky opening song to boot.

In 3D it gets irritating after about half an hour or so, and in 2D its utterly pointless and makes the film look really crappy, just a crap load of stuff from rakes, eyeballs, yo- yos, all of the above really being shoved into the camera.

Bodies being found all over the place, killer getting ever closer and the final 2 minutes or so are really disturbing. An unmasked Jason banging at the window is actually terrifying which considering this is the same character that went to space (in Jason X) thats surprising. Overall, could have been better but as it stands, its still a good entry in a mixed franchise.

If you notice, the name Jason is not spoken once throughout the movie and Chris refers to him as This hideous looking man when explaining her story to Rick and It's you! when Jason pulls off his mask to un-hang himself at the barn. With all this, she doesn't know who he is or his history at all, how then, can she dream up Mrs. Voorhees attacking her in the lake????? It makes zero sense. The rest of movie is fun and scary, the way F13 films should be. Kudos to the Rick's eyeball pop out and Vera's spear to the eye-in 3D, these are great effects. The lesser 3D effects are good with poles, juggling balls, red-hot fireplace pokers and yo yo's coming right at you. The replacement Crazy Ralph, Chili and Chuck were somewhat pathetic but Shelly and the bikers make up for them. The We don't accept no food stamps and Is this your rubber? scene along with the white biker's wimpy arms provided some much needed laughs. So, while it is not as good as Parts 2 or 4 and no where near the original, it is a quality Friday worth watching, especially in 3D, so pop on them glasses and enjoy.

A pretty routine Friday sequel outside of that. Still entertaining though. This one doesn't have Jason killing camp counselors but he does find some other twenty-somethings to kill. He also wastes a multiethnic biker trio. Dana Kimmell is a pretty but bland 'final girl.' Tracie Savage brings the sexy this time. There's an annoying fat guy named Shelly, played by Larry Zerner, who I hated. I was counting the minutes until he was dead. The music score for this one has some nice funky '80s beats. It was filmed in 3D so there's lots of scenes where things are shoved in your face. Like when a crazy old man awkwardly thrusts an eyeball at the camera. Yes, I said an eyeball. The worst is when a guy plays with a yo-yo and we get a rather irritating point-of-view for that one. I'm sure audiences in 1982 were thrilled. My favorite scene is when two characters go to a gas station and are told by the rude cashier we don't accept no food stamps. Classic.

There isn't much reason given but Jason (Richard Brooker) kills a middle age couple at their store than heads back to camp Crystal Lake. A fresh new crop of teenagers have shown up to have sex and die. Part 3 Boasted some great 3-D effects at the theater and just recently on DVD. Returning Director Steve Miner uses the 3-D well and many of the deaths are very inventive using this gimmick. The cast is likable and Harry Manfredini's score is solid once again. This is the chapter when Jason gets his iconic hockey mask. His first kill wearing the mask is a classic as he harpoons a character in the eye. The story is by-the-numbers, like all the films in this series, so it comes down to the death scenes and this chapter has some great ones. One character has his head crushed and his eyeballs pop out of his head into the 3-D laps of the audience. One of the most violent deaths of the entire series happens to a character named Andy (Jeffrey Rogers). Andy is walking down a hallway on his hands and runs straight into Jason who brings the machete down and it just destroys his body. The end chase sequence between final girl Chris (Kimmell) and Jason happens in a barn and it has good suspense and some hair raising moments. In the end, Part 3 certainly doesn't deliver anything special, but delivers on what fans of this series expects.

The reasoning was because I always heard this one was only memorable because of the hockey mask and that was it. I finally decided to watch it the other night and I came away pleasantly surprised at how great it is.I will not spoil the story but will tell you this much, it takes place 24 hours after Part 2 and has a great opening scene. Unfortunately the pacing is quite off in this one compared to the first two and there is a little more back story to our heroine this time around. This means it takes a little time to get to the actual killings but once they start its great to watch. Shelly is also one of my favorite characters in the series because of his humor and of course for what he provides our Jason.I wish I could have seen this in 3-d like it was originally meant to because the kills in this movie are the most brutal yet. Between the harpoon and the handstand kill(which is very sick and pleasing I admit), this movie out did its self and helped set up the rest of the series. I can see why some fans detest this movie but I love it. Even though it loses its scare factor from part 2, Jason actually runs in this movie and jumps off of barns. He is more menacing but is still human and not undead yet. For the people who read my part 2 review and noticed I scored this one slightly lower than part 2 but noticed I said I like this one better there is a simple reason. The kills in this movie are great and its a more fun ride than the previous two. I believe this movie started the series into an attractive ride and focused less on scaring the viewer. But the kills are still just as shocking and as usual you cant help but root for Jason in this movie. So I give this movie a 4 outta 5. Watch it after watching the previous two.

Again, we have a sex crazed couple, the boyfriend who likes to walk on his hands, more than his knees. Then we a red headed, movie freak/aspiring actor who likes masks to hide his plain features, and their female friend, Chris, returning to the scene of the crime, haunted by her recollections of the never dying Jason Voorhees. Chris meets her old boyfriend Derek, back up at the lake who tries to get her through this tough time. And then we have the slashings and the mutations by our lovable Jason, and this includes a middle aged couple at the start, running a market, the woman actress apparently used to date David Caruso at one stage. Yeah, believe it. We also have three bikers who our teen loving spirits clash with, but like all the others, all these three of course meet their demise. I loved the two hippies, Chuck and Chilli, that rode with our teenies, they were probably the only saving grace. I loved it especially when they smoked up their van. Check out the strained monologue between Chris and Derek. Typical Friday fare, not badly shot, but most of the cast here are in desperate need of acting lessons.

So after stealing new clothes from a local couple who owns a local store and of course sends his thanks by murdering them. So he then hides in a barn by the lake when our lead girl Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell) and her friends come to the lake for the weekend (also I will say she's one of the most attractive lead girls in the series) and one by one her friends are offed by Jason some of which very cool (the character Vera gets a harpoon in the eye & Andy gets a machete in the willy). Then we get to the climax where now its Chris & Jason going 1 on 1 and she actually has the smart idea of leaving however the car doesn't have any gas. Then in the barn she knocks out Jason puts a rope around his neck and hangs him but much to her horror and shock HE'S STILL ALIVE!!!! So then a biker who Jason knocks out tries to get revenge but is immediately killed (which is obviously time to stall for Chris) so after Jason kills the biker Chris takes the opportunity and puts an axe in Jason's head and he's still going for a few seconds before collapsing and seemingly dead. So the. Chris sleeps throughout the night in a boat and has a nightmare that Jason is still alive and comes after her but then she's dragged into the lake by Mrs. Voorhees but then she wakes up and freaks out and the. You question her sanity after that the camera zooms in on Jason's dead body and then an eerie shot of the lake ending the film.Now I said in the title that I'd be happy if the Friday The 13th films ended here (and doing research it really was supposed to end here) and I like the sequels but this should've been Jason's death an axe in the head no way he survives. Also I know about the wide consensus that the original trilogy of Friday The 13th with a human Jason are the best of the series and I somewhat agree with that. I say that because even though I like zombie Jason and a few of the zombie Jason films I prefer human Jason. Human Jason is better because he's more intimidating because he's human, he's one of us and this could be a real case scenario. Also this is my second favorite of the series because here I'd say Jason is either 75/25 or 50/50 because in Part 2 there's no doubt in your mind that Jason his human he felt pain, he was cunning, and he could be knocked down for the count but however in Friday The 13th Part 4 The Final Chapter he's more of a supernatural human because apparently not even an axe to the head could kill him & he has the strength of 1000 men. But here he's still human but this is where you see he begins to take a more supernatural turn because close to the end he crushes the character Rick's skull forcing an eye to pop out with his bare hands and obviously survive an axe to the head but despite that he still can feel pain and has emotion (as seen when he was limping throughout the last 15-20 minutes of the movie). Anyway this still stands as the Second best Friday The 13th behind Part 2. 4.5/5 Stars.

What better feature to use than 3-D, which experienced something of a resurgence in the early 1980s? This leads to some pretty ingenious and memorable gags, and it doesn't matter if we can clearly see the strings manipulating the objects coming towards the camera, it's really all part of the fun, in this sequel which is more about the 3-D effects and excellent use of widescreen than graphic violence.The formula was really becoming like a well worn pair of shoes by this point, in a script (co-written by Martin Kitrosser, script supervisor on the first two movies) with a standard set-up of unknowing young folk hoping to have a good time in a remote cabin but instead falling prey to the maniacal Jason Voorhees.One will note just how unknowing these horny fools are they truly have no idea who this killer is; the name Jason is never even uttered here. He uses a variety of implements and methods - spear, head crushing, electrocution, the standard slashings and stabbings with his trusty machete, and as played by Richard Brooker, is a very stealthy and creepy character here, possessing that relentless Terminator like quality that we know and love so well. Harry Manfredini's score is highly enjoyable as always, and even gets a funky disco style reinvention during the opening and ending credits. In terms of the acting, it may very well be (mostly) amateur night at the movies, but that doesn't mean the characters and performances aren't at least entertaining. Standing out are trouble making bikers Ali (Nick Savage), Fox (Gloria Charles), and Loco (Kevin O'Brien) - definitely a priceless trio, Tommy Chong lookalike stoner Chuck (David Katims), and lovable, pathetic Shelly (the engaging Larry Zerner), the man who will go down in history as having provided Jason with the hockey mask that was to become part of the iconography of the horror genre. The lovely Dana Kimmell is an appealing final girl.Steve Miner, the man with the distinction of having helmed two F13 series sequels, Part 2 and this one, does a capable job; the movies' pacing is just fine, and its great moments are always timed well, with a healthy nod to the first film in terms of shots near the end, a healthy amount of humour, and a cracking finale with some wonderful chasing going on.The sentimental favourite in the franchise for this viewer (it was the first entry I saw), it remains great fun upon repeat viewings.Eight out of 10.

Just when you thought it was safe to go back to Crystal Lake. The first hour of the film is almost a carbon copy of the second. Dana Kimmell does a good job following in the footsteps of other Friday girls Adrienne King and Amy Steel, but unlike the first two films the rest of the cast of teens are annoying. Larry Zerner's character of Shelly in particular is almost unbearable to watch. They try to make the character sympathetic but he just comes off an irritating and nosy mess. Being a Reagan era 3D movie, the film is full of gimmicky moments of characters consistently poking sharp objects at the screen. Viewing in 2D can cause these moments to take away from the serious tone of the film, so watching in the intended 3D is best if possible. And once again Miner shows the last five minutes of the final film which combined with the opening credits, wastes roughly eight minutes. The use of techno music was a mistake, and the surprise dream endings are really starting to get me rolling my eyes. This Friday is famous for being the first to put the old style hockey mask on Jason. The long awaited reveal of Jason strolling down the pier first dawning the mask, as well as other impressive kills heightened by an even more menacing Jason keep an otherwise brush away movie from a lower grade in the mid to high forties. Although the movie isn't that good by any means, the decision to throw on the Hockey masks helped make this movie directly responsible for creating one of Horror's greatest villains as well as inspiring thousands of kids to throw away their Spider-Man costumes, and through on the jumpsuit and mask. Also features the handstand death, one of the more effectively executed kills in the series.

For one it is absolutely an acquired taste. I mean the first several instalments which I am watching in order are essentially the same. Friday the 13th features more of a story and a background to set up the series, the second instalment literally is just a pile up of bodies and now Friday the 13th Part 3 features a new group of youngsters who fall victim to the one and only Jason Voorhees. Basically to enjoy these films and truly become a fan of them you have to enjoy the lore they create, and enjoy them coming up with new and fantastic ways for Jason to cut his terror through a new group of campers or some variation. This instalment is most important because it gives Jason two of his most iconic features. One if of course the Hockey Mask that is synonymous with him, and the large gash on the forehead of the mask. Friday the 13th is about nudity, blood, teenagers, and Jason and Part 3 doesn't disappoint. Is it brilliant? No. It's the same formula as part two only the cast is a little better and the deaths are amped up. The attempt at a back story in this case is a young woman who had met up with Jason years ago in the woods. She returns to the farm with her friends to try and get over that memory.Because Friday films usually have such a large and varied cast I am only going to call out the performances that are main characters or characters that do actually stand out. Dana Kimmell is our scream queen this time around. She plays Chris, the heroine who saw Jason years ago and is faced with him again. She does as well as any previous or future scream queens in the series. She isn't particularly stand out but does well. Paul Kratka plays her estranged boyfriend Rick. He is monotone and not the greatest actor but fits her decently well. Larry Zerner is Shelly, who is a legend in Friday lore because it is his mask that Jason takes which lasts the rest of the entire series to date. Zerner is probably the most entertaining and probably the best performer in the film. Jeffrey Rogers is also decent as one of the victims, Andy whose death is pretty unique and tailored to a particular talent Rogers has of walking on his hands. Richard Brooker takes up the role of Jason and does a good job of carrying on the character from Steve Dash in part 2. I don't think Jason really reaches his stride until Kane Hodder took over the character.One of the interesting points about Friday the 13th Part 3 is the fact that it was shown in 3D. The DVD copy I have of this film does actually have a 3D version and two pairs of the old red and white cyan glasses. I started watching it in 3D because there are definitely some cool aspects of 3D in it but it became annoying in the first half hour wearing the paper glasses. Still they were ahead of their time and actually made the 3D work. Steve Miner returned to helm the third instalment which is always good to keep consistency in check. Miner knows what people want to see and not to mess with what works. To some this film and the previous ones would seem atrocious, silly, predictable but to true slasher/horror fans this is what makes us tick. Good vs Evil, a killer that can't be stopped, ridiculous over the top kills, and a campy silly good time.

Vera getting the ole' harpoon in the eye still makes me cringe. Jason's choice to hide in a dimly-lit barn was perfect. Seeing that monstrosity emerging from the shadows could give a robot the shivers. The only thing I didn't care for was the Voorhee's pop-up dream sequence at the end. They should've used Jason decapitating Chris instead. Speaking of Jason, Richard Brooker's portrayal of the killer is the most powerful out of all the actors who've played him. They've all done great work, but Brooker really stands out. I loved how he smashed his head through the van's window as he tried to free himself. His peering out the window of the cabin is the creepiest Jason scene, in my opinion. Plus, the make-up used on the character was totally disgusting and unsettling.

Before that, it looks, feels and acts way too much alike the two predecessors, and there's few things to enjoy except three local hoodlums who gets mixed up with farming.

This was the first of the series not only to have the hockey mask but also to feature a hulking Jason (rather than the average guy he was in number 2...well, sort of average....). Also, since Ralph from the previous films is dead, they had some random bum lying in the middle of the road as the Doomsayer. He's hilarious not only because his scene starts off innocently enough, but also because he doesn't have any other scenes and because (for some unexplained reason) he carries around a disembodied eye. I really wish this guy would've been in one of the sequels, but I guess he just didn't have the same impact on viewers that crazy Ralph did. Also, like number 2, this attempts to ape the final scare from the first film. But the results are, to put it lightly, moronic. Besides the nutty homeless guy, the only character I really like in this one is Shelly. He's the token nerd who's significant for two reasons. One, he's hilarious. His incessant and gruesome practical jokes (possibly ripped from Pete Walker's proto-slasher The Flesh and Blood Show) annoy his friends so much that I'm surprised they still talk to him. Two, his character is the one who brings along the hockey mask that Jason goes on to wear in all the sequels! So this is indeed a very important character. The others annoy me to no end. Dana Kimmell as Chris is one of the worst heroines in Friday history. Every word out of her mouth sounds so snotty that I'd swear she can't even help it. Her boyfriend, played by Paul Kratka, is as dumb as a bag of rocks. I'm willing to forgive him only because he has the coolest, most eye-popping death scene in the movie. Come to think of it, I also kind of liked the couple from the beginning of the movie, but they don't last too long. Steve Miner returns from the excellent Friday the 13th Part II, but his work here isn't quite as great. The frame is filled out nicely, and there's a number of moody tracking shots, but it falls victim to the film the movie around the 3D gimmick rather than manipulate the 3D gimmick to suit the movie. Still, there's a number of great moments. I love the first scene of Jason in his mask - the wide shots of him approaching the girl are very creepy, especially with that moody Manfredini score in the background.I was very excited to see this one in 3D, but sadly the DVD suffers from a sort of double vision effect, rendering the 3D almost worthless.

Things, such as Jason's grubby hands and various weapons, are constantly flying at the camera. It was probably fun to watch this second sequel in 3D, although it is is one of the dullest Jason flicks in the series. Jason at the very least is finally sporting a hockey mask, but the actor playing Jason clearly was given no sharper directions than to chase after various teens and kill them. He even appears to stumble once or twice. It must be the mask. This is definitely not Kane Hodder's Jason, which had real presence. Plot-wise, there is no plot. Just poor stumbling Jason chasing after and mowing down a bunch of nitwit kids. To be fair, the supernatural, unkillable, Frankenstein-like Jason will not make his appearance for another sequel or two. But this Jason looks like a punk. After all, a slip of a girl ends up besting him. Still, any Jason flick is better than all of the HALLOWEEN sequels strung together.

Totally cheesy too, but you have to laugh when someone does this which puts the movie in the so bad it's good category.The kills are actually pretty good, especially with the guy walking on his hands but they're just ruined by the fact that they're still pointing things at the camera as they die.However, I love how this movie shows the origin of the hockey mask which became the classic look of this murderer. The problem is that the mask looks very cheap looking and Jason pretty much looks like a normal guy of average height. He really should be taller and larger, because he didn't look scary at all.

Not so with Friday the 13th - the first two installments are mediocre slasher films but the series really hit its stride with Parts III and IV (and then hit the nadir with Part V ... then got okay again in part VI ... then dumb again, etc.).In my humble opinion, Part III is the second best of the series right after The Final Chapter. It's a bad film by any stretch, with horrible dialogue and acting, many moments of bad camp and a completely cheesy disco theme. Still, I loved every second of it. Richard Brooker's version of Jason Vorhees as a deformed, murderous hick was by far my favorite - I like it better when Jason is burly like a truck driver and runs around a lot. This is also the film when Jason gets his hockey mask, in a scene that isn't nearly as iconic as you might have guessed. There are some memorably creative / gross kills, and the best damn final chase scene in the entire series. Jason appears without his mask for some of the run time and he's pretty creepy. I even liked the fake / dream ending.This film is horrible cheesy and stupid but it's a really enjoyable guilty pleasure and a pretty solid example of the slasher genre. I'd sooner recommend The Final Chapter but if you like that, give Part 3 a try. Trust me, plot is not the strong suit of the series and you'll miss nothing by watching them out of order. "},{"Title":"The Hockey Mask!","Date":"21 May 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" The opening is recaps of Part 2's exciting climax.Viewers are treated to zany music from Harry Manfredini during the intro credits that seems abit out of place for a Friday The 13th film.On the night of the day after Ginny's plight of survival, we have a couple that run a ma and pa mini mart in the general area of the murders. Edna is scalding her procrastinating husband Harold about chores. On the television a fleeting news report authorities are hailing the crime the worst ever in local history and have been combing the area for more bodies since dawn. This sequence involving minor characters is a pleasant mixture of comedy and horror but it is also rather long running nearly ten minutes with a barrage of silly false starts and 3D gimmicks. Edna even sees Jason in the shadows outside but mistakes him for her husband. Easy opportunity victims.Now the central players enter the picture, Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell) is driving her van full of friends up to her parent's cabin at Higgins Haven to enjoy the weekend but first they have to pick up Vera a blind date set up with Shelly by his roommate Andy, also in the van is Andy's pregnant girlfriend Deb, and couple of potheads named Chuck and Chili F13's very own Cheech And Chong.They stop outside Vera's home where Shelly's asked to come out to meet his date date but the humorous muffled response from the bowels of the van are Bring her to me! Chris tells Andy and Deb that they are going up to the cabin to have fun not to mind her that it has been two years since she has been up there. A hint of a terrible experience in her past at the cabin.But Shelly does exit the van and viewers learn he has a obnoxious habit of playing scary pranks on people. Andy chides him to quite doing those things and not to embarrass him. Shelly's answer is Could you be yourself if you looked like this? hinting at personal issues of condescending self esteem.Back in the van and on the road they pass Edna and Harold 's mini mart watching the medical staff load the couple's bagged bodies up into a EMR vehicle. An ominous atmosphere hangs over the group in the van Deb says encouraging words to Chris. The first of two scary omens.Next omen they nearly run over a sleeping hobo in the road but once wakened by the gang he with a disembodied eyeball removed from his pocket and hung-over fueled rants escalating into warnings look upon this omen go back from whence ye came I have warned thee I have warned thee. The sight of the disembodied eye repulses the gang to scramble back to the van ignoring the old man's gibberish they drive around him.Upon arrival to the cabin Chris' boyfriend Rick surprises her with a playful scare and the group begins to unpack and rooms are determined. Everyone is in cheery moods until Shelly pulls a prank on Chris that ruins it. Vera and Shelley leave for the store in Rick's VW bug.The blind dates are harassed by a trio of motorcycle gangsters Ali, Loco, and Ali's girlfriend Fox at the register in the store and extorted of $20. But Shelley guarantees writ in stone the wrath of the bikers by striking their bikes down with Rick's VW bug making an attempt to flee back to the cabin. Ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma Shots of Jason partially in picture in the foreground spying on the kids from behind barns and through windows foreshadow the coming massacre.This is my second favorite Friday The 13th movie. Livelier characters than the two previous IMHO dull characterless tensionless Fridays with some funny lines, campy moments, and some of the best on screen kills offered in the franchise.Shelly Is that all you two are going to do this weekend? Is smoke dope? Chuck Why not man is there a law against it? Shelly There are better things to do with your life! Chuck Like what? Chili I can't think of anything? Also there is a undeniable post traumatic abuction and rape subtext ruling in Chris and Rick 's relationship that the traumatic event of 2 years ago spoken of and the couple's lack of bedroom intimacy is related.The film drops a lot of obvious information, Rick snickers cold in here when Chris pushes his playful advances away. Another example Rick loading hay bails into the loft of the barn he remarks this is sweat of a worker not of a lover. And again, three hours a day to fulfill our needs, one in the morning, two in the evening. Before she recounts to Rick what exactly happened that day two years ago just moments earlier Rick whines about barriers coming between them all the time suggesting Chris is unusually frigid.And her confession to Rick of the real reason for coming back to the cabin and the woods where she was abducted is to prove something to myself, prove I am stronger than I think I am. Chris and her courage and Shelly and his faults are sympathetic qualities a refreshing change in the slasher genre.By far Richard Brooker is my favorite Jason Voorhees he plays up to the role of a mongoloid mass murderer with brilliant subtleties. He is a pleasure to watch. The climax in the barn (always the dreaded barn) has become iconic among F13 finishes in fact Part V attempts this to much inferior effect.

What do we get that we haven't seen before? -We don't have all the cool cabins by the lake where the surviving heroine must dodge every corner from the hydrocephalic killer (that's bad), BUT we have a really creepy farm (complete with barn and outhouse) with a lot of creepy corners of its own (that's good).-We have to suffer through about a minute and a half of crappy disco music as the beginning credits roll (that's bad), but otherwise, Harry Manfredini stomps out a great score for this one (a bit of a rehash of the first two, but the last reel has some GREAT chase music, and that's GOOD).-We don't get a single blond haired girl, be she heroine or victim (that's bad), BUT we DO get three bombshell brunettes and a chunky black haired pothead who either get naked or look good in the clothes they are in (that's good....well, luckily, the pothead chick does NOT take her clothes off....again, very very VERY good).-We get all the same great kills with less gore (that's bad....), BUT...we get them in super cool 3-D (that's GOOD).-For over 26 years, Paramount Pictures would not release a 3-D version of the film in VHS or DVD--making all those gore-free killings pretty much POINTLESS (that's bad), BUT due to high viewer demand, they finally caved to the fans' demands and released it in all its three dimensional glory (that's good....not as good as I'd hoped, but damn it's cool watching Rick's eyeball pop RIGHT out atcha....).-oh, and Jason finally gets his damned hockey mask....that's VERY good! OK, that pretty much sums up the movie.....it ain't at the camp anymore, four chicks and their horny boyfriends go on a vacation of the damned, you get an eyeball, and Jason decides to play Goalie for the first of 10 times.LOL, I'm teasing....well maybe not, but that's pretty much it...The acting, is to say the least, BAD, but there is actually a good humor that runs through the length of the film. You don't get the deeper character development you manage to get out of The Final Chapter and a few of the subsequent films, but you will actually grow to like some of the doomed campers (particularly Shelly and Vera....the film's odd couple.....and you end up pretty dang surprised that Vera bites it, because in all honesty, her character is better developed and more all-around likable than the film's solo survivor, Chris Higgins). There is an interesting side note with a biker gang, a grocery store manager on a crapper, and a Crazy Ralph-esquire doomsday prophet. Pretty much all of the familiar clichés are here (the weird fat guy, the jock guy, the stoners, the hot chick...OK, several of those), and we even get a strange little back story that really adds nothing to our surviving camper's likability quotient....but DOES add a little bit of tension between Chris and Jason that we have not seen in the series yet (but an idea that Part 8 eventually tries to duplicate....even more poorly than this one does....at least in this one, it's an ORIGINAL idea...).The chase scene is a fairly big stand-out in the movie....it starts with a BANG as Chris finds the first body, and it doesn't let up from there....even if her annoying moaning and screaming gets on your nerves as bad as it did mine, the fight that she puts up with Jason will be appreciated by any horror fan. With the exception of the Final Chapter, this chase scene is the best (and, arguably better, depending on what you like in a good chase scene) of the series. Jason sustains decent damage, but as we all know, Mr Voorhees takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'.....and even though the big scare moment at the very end is TOTALLY ripped off from the original, you just can't help but be creeped out by the way Jason just appears in that upstairs bedroom window watching Chris in the canoe.OK, there ya have it....not a masterpiece, and in all honesty, barely even worthy of an R rating (seriously....I've seen some PG-13 flicks with more violence, F-word, and bare breasts than this film), but it's definitely a worthy addition to the franchise...in fact, none of the first four are bad at all. DEFINITELY better than the other 3-D gimmick films of the early 80's (ever notice how Jaws 3-D, Amityville 3-D, and this one are all the THIRD pics in their series'?.....hmmm.....maybe Halloween 3 shoulda been in 3-D....but then again, nothing could save that slop....but i digress). If you are new to the franchise, this one is a great little campy movie to see, and if you are a fan, go pick up the new 3-D DVD version!

The characters, the suspense, the soundtrack, the deaths and even the clichés are pretty much the same. I would mention two deaths the one in the lake when JASON shot a girl in the eye with an arrow, and when he slice a guy which was standing with his feet up in two.

So even though the technical high points of this movie may very well have been by accident this film never the less boasts a lot of creepy positives!

A much scarier Jason than the sack-head from Part 2. How he gets it you'll have to watch and see for yourself...OK, Part 3 starts off showing the last scene from Part 2 to get us caught back up on the action. From that we are introduced to a couple who own a small store that is built in with their house. Also it appears that the woman owns the man as well, as she is very cranky and complaining about him. We kind of feel sorry for the guy, but we want Jason to shut that B***h up! Well, we know what happens to story-filling actors, so let's move on to the naive teens down on the farm...Horrible acting here. This is what sets this film back from Part 2. I wanted to like the characters, but the only two I really could say that I liked was Shelly and Chris. And it wasn't really their acting (because like I said, the acting was pitiful), but I liked the characters. Shelly was the curly-headed guy that played all the horrible jokes that everyone else seemed to hate (but I liked them). And of course Chris was our heroine. Another thing the film fails to do is catch us up on what happened to Chris when her parents found her. We basically had to fill in our own thoughts there. She was attacked by a man in the woods. Well, yeah...Jason obviously, and that becomes apparent when she sees his face again near the end of the movie and says, It's you! It can't be! You're dead! ...or something like that. One scene I found funny was when Chris was hiding in the closet upstairs, and after Jason chopped at the door with an ax, she came at him with the knife slashing and stabbing him in the leg...Jason grunted and moaned! The biker gang could have been a nice touch if they would have been used a little differently. But then again, story-filling actors play story-filling roles... And Rick the hick, I wanted him dead from the moment his character was introduced! Oh, and the scene near the end with Mrs. Voorhees coming out of the water, IMO, was either just a dream Chris was having, or it was to pay homage to the original Friday the 13th when Jason did the same thing at the end of it.All in all, this is one of the weaker films in the series thanks to some horrific acting and bad characters. The only true bright spot was Jason getting his mask. I would have liked to give it a higher rating than 5 out of 10, but the acting was just that damn bad...

If you want to hear something original and professional, well that ain't going to happen on this instalment&#x85; so don't hang around. But I guess you'll know what you're getting yourself into, anyway. So, what we got here is Jason in 3-D land, but most likely you won't get to see it in 3-D, which makes the gimmick very tacky and flat with its constant prodding. The yo-yo madness takes the cake! Actually, it would've been tacky anyhow&#x85; but still definitely way more fun. Part 3 is my favourite flick in the rancid series, which wasn't always the case, but with repeat viewings it has really grown on me. I find it enjoyably clunky, despite it having some very nihilistic and unforgettable slaughters. But how can you go past the infamous trademark that bestows itself on Jason, to help him become an icon figure in the horror genre. You can thank the practical joker, Shelly for the noteworthy hockey mask. Although, I found the sack over-the-head in part 2, to be far more creepier. Larry Zerner, who played Shelly (the boy who cried wolf), provided some humour and the script adds a few dabs of irony. The acting is surprisingly decent, and the dim teens are quite likable. The beautiful Dana Kimmell in the heroine role, as Chris, makes an impressionable mark. Uh, now what is hard to shake off, are the badass bikers&#x85; these guys you don't want to mess with&#x85; um, actually that's not quite the case. They're pathetically hopeless and very laughable punks! The jolly teens are your typical kind of sinners that are there to get the chop in quick concession. Most of them don't put up much of fight and are blind-sided. Richard Brooker as Jason is more human and gives the villain a lanky, but still quite towering figure of brute strength. The generic story is a smörgåsbord of clichés, lacking continuity, unexplored details (like Jason's connection with the heroine) and has only a singular objective on mind - watch the bodies pile up, courtesy of Jason.Steve Miner's direction won't set the word alight with such conventional methods, but it's able and he adds an organic rawness to the feel of the film (that only the earlier features seem to have). While, there might little suspense, some drawn-out moments and plenty of false build-ups, but the isolated backdrop still injects an silently eerie air to proceedings and Henry Manfredini's chillingly sneaky theme score hasn't lost any of it's infectious nerve. One thing that ran through my mind was the alluring attraction of that barn. Is there some sort of message lurking there for its important attachment to the story&#x85; with people popping in and out and simply staring at it in amazement?An entertaining, cheesy romp, if somewhat quite standard entry to the series.

Maybe in part it is nostalgia for the 1980s. You have to admire that they created the Jason character and made some pretty good movies with good suspenseful atmosphere. This one is one of the best of the series.I think the first four are overall the best. The later movies were just too unrealistic (although they did have some interesting scenes). I say that because in the later movies Jason is too invincible (being brought back to life by lightning in Part 6, e.g.) and they have scenes where Jason walks through woods and yet catches people running. Just too unrealistic. I know it is known that the actor who played Jason in the later movies, Kane Hodder, didn't think Jason should run since it was beneath the character or something. However, the first four movies are better (ignoring the fact it was Jason's mom in the first one killing people) because Jason is more realistic. It's scarier when Jason is tough and is not easily hurt or killed, but at the same time does not act superhuman. He is scary due to his determination. That is why I think Jason in parts 2, 3 and 4 are the best overall. It just got too over the top in later movies.POSSIBLE spoilers below This third installment is great, certainly among the best of the series, maybe the best (probably a close tie with part 4, it's hard to say part 3 or 4 are not the best two overall in the series). We have a great heroine, played by Dana Kimmell, Jason first gets his hockey mask, we have unique killings. Richard Brooker does an excellent job playing Jason, the subtle body language he uses to make Jason menacing. Jason is deliberate in this, very focused on his mission of killing people. Plus, compared to part 2, you see a lot more of Jason now. Many of the part 2 scenes were filmed too much in the dark, you don't see much of Jason. Here you have more shots of Jason openly tossing over hay bales in the barn, for example, looking for the main female (Chris), where you get to see more of him from interesting camera angles, his body language, his determination. The sack Jason wore in part 2 was OK, but Jason just looks scarier, more menacing here. Maybe it was due to the hockey mask in this movie, and to Brooker playing Jason well.The final chase sequence is, as others have noted, action packed and suspenseful. The first killing where Jason is actually wearing the hockey mask is memorable, he is deliberate and patient with his weapon of choice (speargun). This is the movie where Jason really develops his own style, and becomes iconic almost in the horror genre.

The acting ranges from believable to just plain silly. Dana Kimmell is a good sport through most of the movie, but her acting can get corny at times, but then again the script doesn't give her too much to work with.

Unfortunately for them, the infamous hockey mask-clad, axe-wielding maniac, Jason, has other plans for them. This 3rd entry in the Friday the 13th series is goofy and dumb, but nevertheless an entertaining slasher flick. While the film may have been a lot more effective in 3D during it's original release, on DVD the images&#151;including characters putting object in the viewer's face, yo-yos being lowered into the camera, snakes striking and, silliest of all, a guy's eye being popped out of his dead&#151;are laughable, but in a fun sort of way. The characters are clichéd but fairly likable, there's some alright gore and the film has an overall decent sense of humor, something that is desperately needed to make generic slasher flicks work. In the end this was one of the more enjoyable entries in the Friday series, by no means a masterpiece but enjoyable enough for a brainless slasher flick.Director Steve Miner has since gone on to direct the 1986 horror/comedy House and the 1999 killer crocodile flick Lake Placid. None of his horror efforts have been especially great, though he clearly realizes that the main objective of a horror film is to entertain and as a result his films are never boring or sloppily made. 5/10.

This time, Jason gallantly ventures from Camp Crystal lake to a barn, where he battles evil bikers, hippies and slays teenagers and the like.The character Shelly is very oddly sympathetic, which is strange because most of the time characters in these films are never sympathetic.Of interest to Jason fans for being the first Friday film to feature the hockey mask. Once again, there's something funny about hearing Jason grunt whenever he falls down or gets hit with something and watching him chase after his victims (something Kane Hodder, the most famous of all the Jason actors, ruled out as soon as he took over).

The group almost runs over a bad attempt to replace Crazy Ralph from parts I and II, perhaps they should have. One of this bunch is a practical joke playing goofball who wears a hockey mask right before getting killed, and Jason, needing a replacement for his burlap sack from part two, decides to try it on, and gets his hockey mask for the first time here in this movie. And for the second Friday the 13th movie in a row, there is VW bug used throughout. The climax, which rips off both Friday the 13th parts one and two, is good, as our heroine axes Jason in his head, but the film goes on for two scenes too long, with a ridiculous deus ex machina (involving a biker who was shown getting hacked to bits coming back to life to intervene in Jason's attack on the girl) followed by an equally weird encounter with Jason's mother. The real attraction to this one was probably the 3D effects, but the 3D effects aren't really that good. They basically amount to nothing more than people pointing at the camera, handing cigarettes towards the camera etc. It's obvious that they didn't have any new ideas with this one, so they just basically remade the second film, only with a more light hearted tone throughout. This has probably the most likable characters in the series, even this film's Cheech and Chong clones weren't that bad, and again, for the most part, the ending is good, too. Part III isn't as intense as the first two were, and doesn't have the darker tone of the first two, but it's still a worthwhile.

You got hippies, a terrible actor, and bikers. After Jason decides to keep up his old gig and start picking them off one by one, you must consider the simple facts inside the movie.

Four, bikers who steal the actors wallet, then gets all pissy whenever they run over their motorcycles. Ok whatever, the deserve to die in my eyes. Chris battles Jason while finding out all of her friends are killed off. Jason picks up his infamous hockey mask from the terrible actor and will never put it down. Chris tries to run from Jason, well obviously that won't work, so now she must put up a stand to fend him off. She hits him over the head with a piece of wood, nope. Tries to stab him, keep trying. Tries to hang him, wrongo. Finally puts an ax into his head once and for all. But is he dead is the question?The hockey mask is still inside the movies today along with the ax mark that Chris put there at the end.

After his success with part 2 of this series, this film goes down as a disappointment, however. Miner's name appears in the credits of some truly great horror classics going all the way back to Last House On the Left among others. The 3D concept of this film seems to have clouded his typically stellar vision, though.Jason is back, and this time he is bigger, stronger, and more resourceful than he has been up to this point. He trades in his overalls and gunny sack from part 2, and ushers in the era of the khaki pants, green work shirt, and of course the hockey mask for this one. Plenty of youngsters (and a threesome of bikers) get wasted with various implement tools, and even a spear gun. This film has all that you'd think it would need to be good, except something is missing.The acting is so wooden it's unbelievable. The film isn't as suspenseful as you would hope it to be, until the typical last female standing vs killer sequence where it picks up quite a bit. Jason gets the crap beat out of him as he tries to track the pretty brunette down. The conclusion is murky, just like in part 2, and it clearly left things wide open for further sequels (as intended).The main reason the film comes up short is the fact that you cannot view it in 3D on your home screen. I'm sure it looked cool in the theater, but those days are two decades past. Steve Miner's work now looks forced as he had to spend so much time setting up shots that would look good in 3D, that he didn't really have time to make the film very scary.Oh, well. It's not like this is the worst film of the series. It's just not up to par with Miner's prior effort which was excellent.5 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound p.s.

The actors are terrible, and show absolutely no character at all, except maybe the effects kid who likes scaring his friends with pranks, such as fake knives in the back, but you already know what's going to happen to him right from the beginning, so I guess his character doesn't even really count. Aside from him and a pot-smoking hippie, I really started having difficulty telling who was who; everyone looked and acted the exact same. Of course I don't think the producers were even looking for good actors; I mean what would they need them for, their characters don't even have last names.I know what director Steve Minor was thinking, and it wasn't that he would like to make a good horror movie. He was thinking, Why not take the first and second films, put them together and cash in on their success. Much to my dismay, he did exactly just that. Any originality that would have been thrown in to this story, got thrown out the window when the opening credits stopped rolling. This movie is not just a typical Friday the Thirteenth movie, it's a remake of a typical Friday the Thirteenth movie. The story could be summed up by saying yet more teens go to a camp where a whole other load of teens have been killed already,and then, in the same fashion as their predecessors, the group is killed off one by one. Except, of course, for the sole survivor who must do battle with Jason in a ridiculously long and draggy manner. I honestly believe that even people watching movies for the first time could predict this horrid piece of film work. There are a couple of good moments in this movie, for instance there is a hilarious scene in which the pot-smoking character is in the outhouse and thinks he's hallucinating. There are also a couple of good gory effects done in the movie especially a scene in which you see one of the characters split completely in half. Though I have to say these minor instances give very little overall impact on this bottom feeder of a film. Minor isn't going down alone though. Writers Carol Watson and Martin Kitrosser contributed absolutely squat themselves. It seems they just told the actors to act like themselves and then run around the woods and inside a cabin until it was there turn to die. My friends kid brother could have done more with Frank Mancuso's scrawny budget.I could go on for hours about how terrible this film was, but I won't. Instead I will warn everyone, including the fans of the series, that unless you get a chance to see this in the theatres in 3-D do not go rent this movie or even think about watching it on cable, even if there is nothing else on.

This one picks up right after part 2, with Jason surviving being stabbed with a machete. He abandons his cabin in the woods, kills a couple of people, gets some new clothes and then arrives at his new hunting ground. The victims are just the usual teenage fodder, nothing new or special. What does make part 3 stand out is the suspense and gory deaths. This is genuinely creepy as you are always wondering where Jason will jump out from next. The death scenes were outstanding- a guy is cut in half whilst he is walking upside down, a girl gets a harpoon in the eye and a guy's head is crushed until his eyeball pops out! They would probably look better in its original 3D format, but it still looks good. One major complaint though- this film sees Jason ditch his whole motive of revenge for his mother's death and just slash everything in sight. I felt that the set-up of part 2(cabin in the woods contains his mother's severed head) was a lot more believeable. He does get his hockey mask, but i think it would have been better if in later sequels he got a different mask each time. This could have been the director's intention but his successor in the director's chair took the lazy way out. This could have added a small bit of originality into the same old formula.This is the second last installment where Jason is still thought to be human, even though he survives a machete through the torso in part 2 to go on this rampage, and an axe in the head in this installment to go on his final rampage as a human in The Final Chapter, where he is finally stopped by a machete in the head. An enjoyable film for slasher fans, I give it 7 out of 10. "},{"Title":"Jason III Electric Boogaloo","Date":"16 February 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Let's be honest if you're a fan of the so-called slasher genre, you know what to expect from the early 1980s entries in the Jason franchise. While not masterpieces at any rate, the films to continue to rake in a steady stream of cash through online sales and rentals, new movies are still being written and produced every few years.  There really is no end in sight!The first film Friday the 13th set the standard for the subsequent films, usually following at a rate of one per year (excluding 1983 & 1987). Unfortunately, this was the problem the first Jason flick was  lacking in almost all departments, and today, is mostly revered for the legendary post-cult status and historical significance (Once in a while, you're like to come upon a fact sheet somewhere that mentions how Betsy Palmer, who played Jason's mum in that film, drove to the lot in her own car every day she was to be on the set). But as ridiculous as it was amusing, Sean Cunningham was able to get the film into orbit, although it doesn't seem particularly stable at any point the plot sets us in Camp Crystal Lake, following what seemed to be a modern riff on a classic urban legend--a psychopathic family hiding in the woods, preying on clueless teenagers bent on a summer rife with sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll (sound familiar? the type of story was actually cinema fare long before Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre of '74, though most GenX and GenY fans probably aren't in any hurry to scoop up many pre 1960's horror classics like The Corpse Vanishes, the original House on Haunted Hill, or the Cat People--which was also remade the same year Part 3 hit audiences stateside) The second film followed suit a year later, and was essentially a rehash of the first (and not in an endearing fashion, either--after viewing the entire series, one could argue Part 2 is the worst in the series, but it's photo finish for last place, in my opinion).  Making another film was akin to spitshining a turd, and Part 2 is possibly the worst thing Miner ever directed.This brings me to Friday the 13th, Part 3.  From it's comical video box cover and theatrical posters, it's obvious that the movie's bent on reaching some new kind of low. And it succeeds on every level (it set out to be a Jason movie, and well, it IS a Jason movie)...But it also intrigues as often as it repulses--the production values blow away Part 1. The storyline, while not something worth really debating over afternoon tea, is a vast improvement over the previous film, and there's actually a real emphasis on campy humor that one shan't overlook.  The 3-D sequences are nothing more than cash-cow gimmick ressurected in the early-to-mid 80s, but are worth noting all the same.  Keep your eyes peeled for the secret Roy Orbison cameo!Many people pass up Part 3 as just more of the same, and while I can't recommend it just on it's own merit (which I can do for parts IV and IX, which are decent even as standalone titles).  It is weak (as a rule, all the films are), but the chances are, if you see one Jason movie, you're going to see them all and you're going to enjoy this entry.Criticized for it's generally bright look and feel, Steve Miner (who also directed Part 2) is actually clearing the air for the viewer. Jason isn't just hacking up camp counselors anymore--he's really invading simple backwoods townfolk in broad (and bright) daylight.  The blood looks fake (and actually sort of tasty), and while the acting is pretty subpar and there's virtually no sympathy for any of the characters, it doesn't make for such a terrible movie. The motorcycle gang members are a absolute hoot, and when Shelly finally died, it started the whole world laughing. I consider Friday the 13th Part 3 to actually be the 2nd best title released in the 1980s, surpassed only by the epic that would follow it two years later.Rating (includes previous two films for comparison) out of 4 stars Part 1 *+/**** Part 2 */**** Part 3 **+/**** "},{"Title":"A great horror movie.","Date":"10 February 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Friday the 13th part 3 gave you a awesome look about the early 1980's.

It's the best of the series, 3-D or not, largely due to lead actress Dana Kimmel being such a pain. Apparently she was on some soap opera at the time, and was therefore something of a name, so when she was approached about starring in a F13 movie, she laid down a couple of conditions no explicit sex, no excessive violence. The studio complied and told the filmmakers (led by director Steve Miner) to tone down the skin and gore. Miner chose instead to go for shocks and suspense, and was surprisingly successful, especially if you got a chance to see it in 3-D. A group of friends (one of whom had survived an earlier attack by Jason) ventures to the woods of Crystal Lake where Jason is alive and well and still slaughtering anyone who happens to cross his path. After disposing of an obnoxious couple of shopkeepers and a biker gang, Jason dispatches the vacationers one by one, in some creatively grisly ways (a crochet needle is driven through a woman's neck and comes out her mouth, a boy is cut in half vertically, a girl is impaled with a hot poker, a boy's head is crushed until his eyeball pops out), until he finally has a showdown with his previous escapee, resulting in his first being hanged, then being axed in the head. This movie utilizes its 3-D gimmick to its fullest effect, never passing up an opportunity to shove something in our face(including a yo-yo, a rattlesnake, a harpoon gun, a pitchfork, juggling apples, and the aforementioned eyeball popping), and makes full use of its scope aspect ratio. It's much more stylishly shot and edited than the previous two, and plays out as a decent thriller even when viewed flat on TV. Other points of interest include the debut of the infamous hockey mask, a rather bizarre nightmare appearance by Mrs. Voorhees (decomposed and worm-ridden) and the opening and closing disco theme! Despite the fact that there is no implication whatsoever that Jason is still alive at the end of this one (which was actually intended to be the final entry in the series), Paramount carried on with five more sequels, until New Line Cinema acquired the rights and unleashed JASON GOES TO HELL and JASON X. Also known as Friday THE 13TH PART 3-D. "},{"Title":"Pretty standard, but enjoyable.","Date":"26 January 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Most people will love this film simply because it marks the union of our favorite mentally-retarded murderer Jason and his beloved hockey mask. Most people will remember it for it's corny 3-D sequences that have no purpose on video/DVD. Most people will hate it because it has a pretty boring beginning. However, all Friday fans should watch this because it does have a different setting/plot than the previous two, and there are some nice atmospheric touches that actually give this film a creepy edge, not to mention that whacked-out ending. The story picks up on Saturday the 14th, the morning after the events of part 2. We follow a troubled female named Chris, who apparently had a run-in with Jason years earlier, who is returning to Camp Crystal Lake with a group of friends to help get her over it. Included in this group is a sexy latina lady, an overweight joker, a Tommy Chong look-alike and about a half dozen pieces of insignificant morgue meat. Along the way they run into a biker gang, whose fate is more than obvious and after the exposition (which takes awhile) the movie starts treading down familiar territory. What helps this movie out is that the events take place at a farmhouse, as opposed to the standard campsite, and there is a little more back-story to the leading lady this time around. Jason is a lot creepier and he actually runs in this movie! (as opposed to teleporting, as exhibited in the latest installments). This is one of those movies that is just average. It's not my favorite F13 movie, but it's not the worst. If you miss it, don't lose any sleep over it.

Jason lurks in the shadows as he prepares for his blood bath, and this time he picks up the now famous hockey mask from one of the kids who happens to stumble across him. This is a good movie to watch and not think about. There is great suspense and something happening every minute, and lots of dead bodies piling up in the running time.

Most of the body counts are presented on screen and in a special way (like the guy who gets split in 2 while walking on hands). There are also scenes with great photography(referring to the scene where the guy plays the yo-yo, and how it reaches the camera), well, basically the scenes that were meant for the theaters in 3D. As for the surprises, this is where we see Jason in his infamous hockey mask for the first time in the Friday history. That was a pretty pleasant surprise for I who had skipped part 3 and watched the whole series. But the other surprise is a let down at the opening credits where we see a cool Jason Voorhees corpse from part 2(?). But as the camera gets closer to his face, we see a HUGE FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 logo fly right out of his face mixed with a technical dance music(what the hell!!!???), that opening scene made the movie look like funky dance movie or some cheesy musical if you had missed the FRIDAY THE 13TH part. Overall, the movie is pretty good and is worth renting. 8/10   -2 for the opening credits, they could have done better by mixing the audio with the creepy chi-chi music.

I'm so used to the FRIDAY films being solid, above average horror films with the usually classy studio backing. But this, the third installment, is totally amateurish in both the acting and the writing departments. Not too mention those cheesy  3-D effects! I was cracking up the entire time. FRIDAY 3 is a good film but it is totally inconsistent with others in its series. First of all, it doesn't take place at Camp Crystal Lake (maybe that can be considered a nice change of scenery). But my biggest problem with this film is that the makers don't even try to finish the backstory started in Part 2. Our answers were never really answered in the previous entry What is Jason? How can he be alive? Where has he been for the past thirty years, etc. etc. Well, this movie doesn't even bother explaining it. Jason just shows up and starts hacking people to bits. This film is a riot. A lot of the acting is atrocious. Dana Kimmell is OK as the heroine but Paul Kratka is awful (and he dies in the film's funniest scene). Jason looks like some hunchbacked buffoon (check out the scene where Kimmel drives away from the cabin and a wounded Jason hobbles after the speeding van on one leg!) and his kills aren't as gory as the previous installments. Besides that, there's also a hilarious disco rendition of Harry Manfredini's classic score. Top it all off with a, ahem, twist ending stolen directly from the original (and which frankly makes very little sense) and you've got yourself one fun little movie.To be fair there are some good scares and the climax is exciting. The most memorable thing about this film, however, is that this is the one where Jason finally gets his hockey mask. And it also has the honor of containing one of the series' most popular murder sequences, where some fool doing a handstand gets chopped in half lengthwise with a machete.So all in all one of the most amateurish of the series but easily one of the most enjoyable.

The traditional 'Jason' hockey mask was introduced for this sequel.  The movie picks up pretty much where the second installment leaves off.  The lady with curlers in her hair is watching the news about what just happened at Camp Crystal Lake, which was the second sequel.  The news clipping that is shown on the TV is actually part of the end of Friday the 13th part 2.  The day after she was murdered by Jason, there are a group of people going to Camp Crystal Lake for a weekend.  It is not mentioned whether they are counselors or not, so it is understood that they are just there to camp out in the cabins.The lake where the movie was filmed was obviously different from the ones in the original movies, probably because it was filmed on a movie ranch.  Even though the lakes in the first two were different, at least they looked to be the same.  The acting was rather poor.  In the beginning where the man is in the store eating the food and sees the snake, the wire that makes the snake move is visible.  Later on in the movie, Jason tries to crush Rick's head and when he does that, his eye pops out, which looked really cheesy.  A few of the scenes were poorly reproduced from the original Friday the 13th movie, especially at the end when the last survivor climbs into the canoe and drifts on the lake.  Jason's mother pops out of the lake half decomposed and pulls her into the water.  Immediately after that happens, she awakens.  Other murder scenes seemed very fake, such as when the girl was shot in the eye with a dart gun by Jason, there was an obvious difference between her real face and the makeup job.  Don't expect this movie to be as good as the first two Friday the 13th movies, but at least it's worth watching.

The harpoon scene was great as well, but I don't understand why they used a dummy instead of the actress. The dummy effect was bad as it looked so unrealistic. They could of easily and realisitically attached the harpoon effect to the actress and used her slumping more realistically into the water.

(Just as 2 picked up after 1). Just like my thoughts on Part 2, I will list the good and bad The Good 1) The tension in this film is unrelenting. With a small exception early in the film to introduce some characters, from start to finish there is never a dull moment. Director Steven Miner - who also did Part 2,  had this craft mastered. 2) Several victims to be slaughtered are not weak, frail, stupid (well, maybe stupid) characters, which was a case with many in Part 2, and in many, many slasher movies. Some characters here are from a biker gang, and others just have bad luck in getting killed. 3) Jason is very intimidating. In my Part 2 review I credited Kane Hodder, he was actually not Jason until later in the series. But the credit can be shared, Jason is a very menacing, towering figure here and in most of the sequels. His hockey mask fit him perfectly! 4) As another reviewer noted, Harry Manfredini's manic score is fitting.The Bad 1) While a few of the characters are formidable, the acting is often weak. Amy Steel gave Part 2 a great hero, with good acting. Outside of Jason too much acting here is stiff, with weak characters. 2) The body count is too high, and too quick. Just like Part 2 (and many horror/slasher films), not enough time is frequently given to allow you to care about the characters (a root problem) thus, feel the tension to build before the killing. 3) The ending does not have the crescendo that parts 1&2 had. I liked the finale, and lack of absolute resolution in the first two films that seems tired by now. 4) The filmmakers tried to overdo the 3D, and it takes a bit away from the film. All in all, probably 3rd best in the series, perhaps 4th (1, 2 & 4 are all good horror), but while the series continued, it didn't have much left to say.

So anyway, the plot had eight friends staying at Kimmell's barn in the middle of the forest, where, very recently, two people were just murdered. So anyway, we also have a biker gang who serve for no other purpose than to be butchered by Jason via machete and pitchfork. Then the teens begin to start dying. Now, like I said above, some of the murders are innovative but generally bloodless. One teen gets a spear in her eye, another one (in a very memorable moment) is cut down the middle while doing a handstand, and, in the great bravura moment, Paul Kratka gets his eye popped out!So anyway, FRIDAY 3 is by no means a good movie, but it will generate some laughs, and, admittedly, some chills during the final chase between Jason (his first time in a hockey mask!) and Kimmell.GORE 6/10 (which is pretty tame for FRIDAY movies) ACTING 3/10 DIRECTION 4/10 SUSPENSE 6/10 ATMOSPHERE 5/10 "},{"Title":"good and bad!","Date":"9 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Ok first off I did enjoy this movie but it was so stupid I won't spoil it but basically Jason rises up at the beginning but it turns out to not even be him which made absolutely no sense at all!

Many people can't tell one Friday the 13th movie from another and that's always kinda peeved me, so let me start by saying if you're gonna watch any of these you should limit yourself to the first four, of which this is the worst.  But when you consider that there are nine+ of these movies that's not bad at all.Jason is alive in this one, and by that I mean he's not a bullet-proof, maggot-faced zombie who could take on 50 armed guys and not break a sweat.  I will always prefer this version of Jason to the latter, because every character actually has a CHANCE of beating him at his own game.  The main character in this one hands him the worst beating yet, and it's always entertaining to watch little Dana Kimmell fight the massive Richard Brooker and win time and time again.  She hits him with a shovel, a log, a knife, books, and an ax, and Jason really seems frustrated at his own inability to catch her.  The murders that lead up to the chase scene are hot-cold, ranging from the awesome handstand death to the very lame electrocute the hippie.So watch F13-3 and see Jason do his thing before he could take 100s of bullets, teleport, possess people and breathe underwater.  When the series granted him these super-powers it basically turned him from a mountain-man psychopath into some sort of alien, and it's a change for the worse.  You'll find that he has more character in these early films, and part 3 has more of the original Jason than any of the other films.  By the end you'll be itching to see what happens next, and you're in for a treat- part 4 is even better!

How could it not be? Little character development, stupidity beyond belief, bad acting, horrible dialogue, and an almost completely unlikable group of teens create one of the worst horror sequels in my history of viewing.The overacting Dana Kimmell is Chris, a whiny bitch who has survived a near-death experience at a lake (is it Crystal Lake? we're never told) and ventures back for a vacation with a group of her friends, all horribly acted and for the most part, unlikable. The superman killer, Jason, who has survived from PART 2, somehow crawled away and has now decided to wreck the kids' vacation. Lots of false scares created by Shelley the joker (who I couldn't wait to see slaughtered), some T&A, unintentional humor (It's you! You can't be alive!), dialogue worthy of an Ed Wood movie (but worse), and great gory deaths are what make up the 90 minutes. The trick ending rips off PART 1, by the way. Also are some great camera tricks utilized for the 3-D theatrical release that look like they would have worked quite well. Now if only Paramount released this on DVD in 3-D......In the long run, PART 3 contains some great splashy gore effects (speargun to the eye, firepoker through the stomach, cutting a handstander in half, squishing a head with bare hands, knife through the chest), but little else worth recommending to a serious horror film fan. Still, it will remain a staple at teen horror parties for years to come along with its previous (better) and later (worse) installments.

It was directed by Steve Miner who helmed Part 2 and later on, Halloween H20. If one thinks about it, there really isn't any plot in the film. Just Jason finding a new place to hide and hack teenagers in weird, gross ways. Anyway, the film picks up one day after the events in Part 2. Jason is now hiding at another cabin in Crystal Lake where a bunch of teenagers get together for a weekend full of drugs and sex. Not long after they arrive, he starts to kill. That is the main plot. There is also a little subplot about the main heroine being attacked by Jason some years before. Well, if you thought the kids in the first two were bad, this one is the icing on the cake. Let's see the heroine, the heroine's loser ex-boyfriend trying to patch things up, two pot smoking hippies who look twice the teens ages, the fat prankster who has an afro, the nice girl who the fat prankster tries to get with, the pregnant friend of the heroine and the horny boyfriend of the pregnant girl. Oh! Also add in a biker trio. Some trivia This is the only Friday flick where Jason's name is NEVER mentioned. This is the first flick to show him with his famous hockey mask.

Since there are 13 survivors from all eight Friday sequels (including Steel,Kimmell,Corey Feldman,Kimberly Beck,Melanie Kinnemann,Shavar Ross,Jennifer Cooke,Lar Park Lincoln,Kevin Blair,Jensen Daggett,Scott Reeves,John D.LeMay and Kari Keegan), a great idea for Part Ten would be for the survivors to return to Camp Crystal Lake as part of a group therapy session...one by one,they are murdered...instead of Jason being the killer,one of these survivors could be suffering from a severe case of psychosis brought upon by post traumatic stress disorder (my money would be on Feldman's creepy Tommy character).

This movie and the series pales in comparision to the Halloween and Nightmare movies, simply because all of the Friday movies seem to be the same (and hence all of these comments seem to be the same, with minor differences, get the irony?--> love that irony). Anyway,                               The story-line does not transition from movie to movie with ease. True, this one along with the others in Parts 1-4 had transitions, but 1-4 use flashback scenes (not cinematic). Then 5-9 skipped the transitions and instead used flashback scenes to connect to Jason's grave or pre-original movie (part fives flashback does not even make sense) and with minor exceptions the later movies do not have (major) related story lines (even Jason (and his mother) disappears, in the 5th (in reality) and 9th (basically) ones, and he is the main guy).Anyway, this is one of the best in the series (top 5 anyway) because 1- it was the first to give Jason the Real/hockey mask 2- it has juiced up music.  3- it even starts out by mind-bending the viewer (if you saw part 2, the beginning of this is not totally expected).  4- it is in 3D. 5- It even had Steve Minor (Friday director) in a cameo/newscaster role (thus it does have something to set it apart from the rest).In general, While none of the Friday's are terrible (5 and 9 probably being the worst), none of them are tense or suspensful or anything more than the routine slashing and killing. Part 3-D has juiced up music, but the same story. Part 8 has a new story twist, but no new music,etc... The better ones in the series add something (like strip monopoly, or Jason with mask, or Jason with 'hockey'/real mask, or 3D, or a claustrophobic environment of a boat), but none of them seem to put it all together in one film.As horror goes, better than average, a good series, but not one of the greats.In general nothing special.Rating wise, three is better than the usual and it may be the best.However,  the 3D version would probably put it over the edge/tie with a latter in the series.

The 3D supervisor was there to introduce it, and to share a bit of previously unknown fanboy trivia. He said the idea for Jason to put on a hockey mask (instead of a potato sack like in part 2) was an inside joke among the Canadian members of the crew (who were responsible for the 3D effects), who wanted to add something that represented Canadian culture to the movie. Ever since then, while the hockey mask has made an important mark on American horror, nobody ever pondered the reason why he wore a hockey mask, instead of a baseball umpire mask or Quiot Riot mask.

Friday the 13th part 3 is classic old school horror. Remember that this movie was made in 1982, that's 17 years ago, so one shouldn't expect the stuff you see now in todays hi tech horror films. No, there's no top notch or even marginal teenage actors, and Steve Miner didn't focus on a reviting, intricate plot, instead his focus was to throw a scare or two at you.This movie has a certain eerie vibe and atmosphere to it, and at the time it was made a lot of people went to see it because it was in 3D. Upon entering the movie at the theater they gave you these cheap 3D glasses, I mean this was mad cool back then, and funny thing was, the glasses actually helped the effects somewhat. Times were different then and morality could be left behind, you watched and laughed at corny humor and fantasized about what it would be like getting a hot babe and got a pretty good scare while you were at it. It was quite neat to look around the theater and see everyone wearing these neon 3D glasses and wiggling and squirming at each killing scene, I mean the theater was packed and you could tell tension was high.

The 1st one was just an introduction and caught people's attention, Part II was a little more scarier due to Jason's deranged mindset. Jason Voorhees is a complete homicidal lunatic there's no doubt about it, this is the last guy you'd want to meet in the woods. In Part III, he is released to menace and slaughter. Part I was a little dull, Part II was better, Part III was terror. Sure the music is corny now but back then it gave the movie a sadistic feel. You always remember the biker gang with Fox, the old man in the middle of the road who warns them of the omen to come holding an eyeball, you wonder what it would be like to make out with a girl in a hammock bed, the weed head couple in the back of the smoked out van, Shelly and his unleashing to Jason the now infamous hockey mask, seeing Jason's hideous face with the hockey mask off, the one guy who could do the quirky, walking hand stand getting totally obliterated with an axe down the crouch (oouch!) The sheer ridiculousness of Jason squeezing poor Ricks head in so hard his eyes popped out, Part III is a classic. What about the black bald headed biker guy who gets his arm chopped off? there was just something about this guy, I mean he epitomizes a guy who should be in a horror movie. You don't watch a horror movie to rate acting, give me a break. You want to see the different characters, you want to see the guy who's a stud with the ladies, the one guy no girl wants to make out with, the guy who DESERVED to be killed. Part III had all of these elements. I feel Steve Miner did an outstanding job with this film. Jason was totally ruthless in this movie and kept on coming at you. Jason's relentless pursuit and chase of the lone survivor Chris was intense. After Jason is hanged and she opens the barn door only to see him standing there was nice scripting by Miner, all of a sudden the black biker who we assumed was dead reappears only to be savagely hacked apart, even as Jason is hacked in the head with an axe he still extends his arms at Chris to suggest her demise is his ultimate goal, unrelenting terror.Opinions certainly vary on this film but it is my favorite of the series. Watching it takes me back in time, a perfect getaway  to the days of old!

Jason gets his hockey mask for the first time, of course.I love all of the Fridays, but the first four are the best. The stories are very close together in the first four. Making them great sequelizations. However after Part IV, the stories are not as close together. But the later ones are very entertaining. Part VIII, is my favorite of the later Fridays. Still, if it were up to me, I'd somehow bring Jason back as his classic figure in the first four. The first four, seem to be Jason's goldest years. James Robinson was actually going to bring this classic image of Jason back. As well as bringing back Freddy as he was in his early movies, for Freddy Vs. Jason. But Robinson was fired.

I decided to base my feelings on the very first screening I ever had of the film, way back in 1982 upon its initial theatrical release -- when it was on a big wide screen and in full-blown 3D. I think it rises above its limitations considerably when viewed as it was intended, although most viewers reading this will probably not have had that original theater experience. I would shave off half a star when watching the standard flat 2D version, as the gimmicky third dimensional effects are really the main star of the movie. There's not much in the way of story, of course ... another group of young people head off on a weekend getaway where they encounter the deranged psychopath Jason. The main girl is a cutie named Chris (Dana Kimmell) who is trying to work out some emotional problems while all her friends are engrossed in the usual weed-smoking and bed- hopping. The lack of a real involved plot here is not a detriment because most F13 fans such as myself only require our man Jason to be doing his thing by dealing unprovoked death in a variety of creative ways. The death scenes here are especially fun in 3D, and they include such gory treats as a guy walking on his hands getting split in half, a spear gun being shot straight out at the audience and into a chick's eye, and a crushed head's eyeball shooting forward. The action really picks up during the exciting climax, which is the best part of the film and worth waiting for. *** out of **** (3D Version) **1/2 out of **** (2D Version) "},{"Title":"Best of the first three?","Date":"18 January 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" A new batch of counselors... oh, wait, no... well, someone should tell the people who wrote the text on the back of the cover of this.

The characters still aren't developed(except for the obnoxious Shelly, who pulls pranks to not be ignored and is somewhat sympathetic), if there are a few that you might remember, such as the deliciously stereotypical, look-at-what-they're-wearing, was-that-ever-fashion 80's gang. It's clear from early on who the lead is, and it works out fine... we somewhat get to know her. There are a couple of creative, memorable deaths, the atmosphere leading up to them(in spite of excessive fake-outs) means we get a chance to be scared out of our minds from it(and it isn't gratuitous the way it is today... well, at least not as much), and it tends to work. This has a good opening and excellent ending, but the middle portion is also effective enough. It's the most fun of these three, that's for sure, the one I could most see myself re-watching. We again get the climax of the film prior to this one, at the beginning of this(and they're really not even cutting it anew, they're just showing it again).

Friday the 13th Part III is a very good movie; the music is fantastically creepy yet upbeat at the same time. The colours are very nice in this film, which shows a horror movie can have nice glowing colours without needing dark rooms to scare the audience. The acting varies, Dana Kimmell as Chris is one of the most appealing and convincing heroines throughout the Friday the 13th series, and she pulls off a very genuinely terrified young woman, being terrorised by Jason Voorhees. Jason Voorhees is also appealingly upgraded in this movie. He is big, sturdy, muscular and menacing; he is a big hulk of horror on two legs. And the legend also gains his infamous hockey mask in this movie. The characters are also very fun in the instalment. Some are humorous and make us feel sympathetic when they are killed off. Some are serious and are easily relatable to, so we also feel pity for them as well. There is also the annoying jester who we come to feel sorry for, and the rejecting bitch who gets her comeuppance. The locations in this movie are really picturesque and fits the Friday the 13th feel very well; a cosy, warm cabin snuggled up deep in the woods. The script is also upgraded as well. Humour and small jokes are inserted here and there, for relief and also to make us feel warm and closer to the characters. The gore is quite well handled in this movie; gruesome in parts and much more inventive in this film. It is enjoyable, however is much more appealing when the popcorn, eyeballs and yo-yo's are flying out of the screen. There are also background stories and flashbacks weaved into the main story, about Chris' past, which tries to give the movie more depth. This is quite unnecessary, but it still works well, and it doesn't bring the movie down in any way. It actually gives a reason as to why these teenagers are visiting these cabins. The ending has it's trademark surprise scare, so look out for that. This third movie in the series is an absolute pleasure.

You'd never guess who it is because the person is supposed to have been beheaded...but she's not now. Weird.This movie was also the first time we come to realize that Jason is an animal lover. In fact I'm thinking that the reason he is so mad and kills people isn't because the people want to have sex, but maybe because he saw them mistreat an animal. Like for instance, the first couple to get offed in this flick don't even want to have sex at all, they just want to bitch at each other and poop, but Jason I think kills them because the dude forcibly stops a bunny from eating veggies, and then eats all the fishes food! What a jerk. So that's that. Jason did the right thing and murdered them. If you look at the movie that way. You realize this was a proactive effort to stop animal abuse.

She even has a sort of back-story to tell involving an encounter with a hideous looking man. Hmm, could it be Jason? One drawback of F13 part 3 is the off screen death of Shelley(who turns up later with a severed throat), and pretty much the rest of the death scenes in this one are not as creative as the deaths from the previous two films. Fox had a good execution but it wasn't even seen. Loco's death was great and looked very painful, and when I was younger I was always grossed out by the bloody cigarette drooping from his lips. The eyeball thing with Rick was pretty cool but has probably seen some better days. My favorite is the handstand one with Andy!! It rocks! The reason I rated it the same as part 2 is because of the last twenty minutes of the film...Chris is running around, she's hiding in the rafters of the barn, she's rolling Jason's head up in the van window, and then she even tries to hang him from the hay rope thingy. All of this gives the pacing a much-needed boost.And I do like the conscious effort of the filmmakers to provide us with an early reason to the classic car not starting (which is in a lot of the F13 films) so we can't yell at the screen. Remember.. the biker gang siphoned the gas from the van so they could burn down the barn! So that was some good foreshadowing...if it can even be called that. My vote is 7/10!

It may be because of the fact that it managed to stretch out the relatively simple premise of a retarded serial killer to 9 films (with another one upcoming that takes place in the far future, no less!).  I mean, take Jason's first appearance, which featured him with a pillow over his head, and then take at a look at Jason Goes to Hell, in which Jason is a semi-supernatural being with the ability to hop into other people's bodies.  The series has evolved quite a bit, if you ask me.  It will be odd to see how different the latest sequel will be than say, Part 3, which is pretty much the same as the first two, only this time Jason has his hockey mask and the girls are better-looking.The film takes place only several hours after the events of the previous movie.  The focus is on a group of teens headed to a farmhouse not far from Camp Crystal Lake for a weekend of sex and fun.  These teens are the basic slasher cliche characters, ranging from the heroine to the geeky loser who seems to p*** everyone off.  The heroine is Chris (Dana Kimmell), who actually once encountered Jason.  She's having trouble adjusting to being in a forest and heads out into the woods(!) with her friend Rick while everyone else stays behind at the house.  Jason then arrives and begins his massive slaughter. The story is as simple as that.With a plot that's basically a carbon-copy of the previous two films, it feels a little odd to review what is pretty much the same movie over again. For 70 minutes,  the movie is every bit as boring as Part 2, due mainly to Steve Miner's inability to build up any good scares or shocks as well as the fact that he takes too long to get the movie going.  His direction hasn't improved much at all (only in the finale, which I'll get to in a moment) and he's certainly not helping himself by not trying anything new or different in this film.There are a few memorable death scenes, particularly one guy who gets slashed in half when he's walking around on his hands.  But these moments aren't built up to particularly well, there's no sense of dread and almost no suspense, and what little of it is there is mainly because of Harry Manfredini's very effective and creepy Ennio Morricone-esque score (It's a little funny to note that the score sounds a bit like the one from The Thing, so Morricone might have received a little inspiration from these films).  It's interesting to note that Part 3 was made in 3-D upon its original theatrical release, which probably explains the numerous scenes of knives and other dangerous objects maniacally waved in front of the screen. I'll admit, if I had seen this movie in the 3-D enhancement, I probably would have found a lot of these scenes more entertaining, but without the gimmick, it's almost a complete bore.The gore effects are in more abundance than in the previous two films, but they still look rather cheesy sometimes.  The most laughable effect is the literal eye-popping scene that was obviously shot to get a reaction out of the 3-D viewing audience.  It just looks fake now.  Nudity is also expected out of a Friday the 13th film and there's very little of it here, almost none at all, and none of it comes from the good-looking girls.  It would have been nice to see Catherine Parks or Dana Kimmell topless for a scene or two, but the fact that Kimmell is the heroine already pushes those chances to zilch (the closest thing to nudity that's been revealed by a series heroine is probably from Melanie Kinnaman from Part V, who was featured running around in the rain braless with a white shirt on).The acting is pretty much as bad as the first two films and I suppose that's to be expected out of a low-budget 80's slasher flick.  Though I hate to sound shallow, this cast is easier to bear than the previous installments because Dana Kimmell and Catherine Parks do make for very good eye candy, and at least they're both better than the horrendous Amy Steel, a scream queen who seems to have her fans despite having all the acting skill and charisma of cardboard.But there is a reason why I rate this above Part 2 (and probably the original Friday the 13th, too) despite how much my criticism seems to place it on the exact same level as that film.  It's because of the last 20 minutes, which features the typical climactic chase where Jason moves around trying to get at our heroine.  All the cliches are used here, such as the car that (in)conveniently runs out of gas, the dead body in the closet, the killer who's really not dead, etc., but Steve Miner actually handles the entire sequence quite well, and I certainly felt just how frantic the situation was.  The finale was good enough for me to rate the film * 1/2 instead of just *.  It by no means makes the movie good or even middling, but it was enough to pull it above the worst of the series.There's a grand unmasking scene at the end which reveals Jason in all his non-glory.  He looks a little different than he did in Part 2, probably because this time he has no hair and was played by a different actor. Actually, he looks a bit like the Ferengi Quark from Star Trek Deep Space Nine and that's not a good thing.  Oh, and what's up with all these scenes of women passing out and finding themselves safe from Jason?  In part 2, Amy Steel was attacked by Jason but woke up in a stretcher with paramedics around her.  In this film, Kimmell relates a similar story about an encouter with Jason in the woods and how she woke up in her own bedroom.  Does Jason just not like to kill girls who pass out in front of him or what?It's a little hard to believe that this film was only 1/3 the way through the entire series.  The next installment, The Final Chapter, differed from all its predecssors in that it was actually scary and consistently entertaining, making it the first wholly enjoyable film in the series.  I'd say just skip the first 3 and go straight to The Final Chapter since that film has a good opening prologue that relates what happened in the previous films, but most people seem annoyed at the idea of skipping installments in a series.

In this edition, we learn that Jason is still on the loose, this time in nearby Higgins Haven. Higgins Haven was a farm owned by the lovely Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell) who is there for a weekend of partying with her boyfriend and her stoner friends. Instead, they become more fodder for Jason and his machete. It is in this installment that Jason first dons his now infamous hockey mask.Interestingly enough, this edition actually has *gasp* character development. Turns out, 2 years earlier Chris had been attacked in the woods by Jason and managed to escape. But will she be so lucky again? Or do we even care at this point? It's a good thing I am a fan of the franchise, because if I wasn't I would definitely give this film a lower rating than I have. The acting is abysmal, the dialog is utterly ridiculous and the idea that the entire area is not SWARMING with police officers (the events of Part 2 happened the night before) is ludicrous.The movie's saving grace is the special effects. I felt like they were very well done, especially if you can see them in 3D. If not, then they look fairly humorous. There is also some decent gore and some of Jason's most brutal kills are demonstrated here. Dana Kimmell is never going to win an Academy Award, but my god is she hot ). Based on these two very important criteria, I'll give part 3 a very impartial 5/10.

That spooky music can only mean one thing. Jason Voorhees has again risen from certain death, ready to slash his way through a new group of innocent teens. And although it introduces that horror landmark known as Jason's goalie mask, Friday THE 13TH PART III is pretty average fare.Even three entries into an 11-film (and counting) series, the plot is no shocker. One, show Jason pulling another Lazarus. Two, introduce a group of semi-likable, horny teens looking for a good time in nature. Three, bring Jason and an assortment of blood-spilling weaponry to the teens. And four, allow the last one or two survivors to do in Mr. Voorhees yet again. I don't want to sound cynical, because I have a special place in my heart for these films. But like it or not, they certainly don't deviate much from a set formula.Among Jason's targets this time out are a couple of potheads, a burly man running a general store in the middle of nowhere, and an evil biker chick and her two henchmen. Director Steve Miner did inject some new life, even a chill or two, but unlike several of his predecessors, didn't go far enough. Despite an enthusiastic young cast of unknowns, it could have really used a bolt of energy to liven up the slow spots. To be fair, however, viewers today are not seeing the film as it was originally intended -- in 3-D.Though it's one of the weaker films in the series, Friday THE 13TH PART III is sure to please fans of low-budget 1980s horror.

Even in terms of Friday the 13th sequels, this is really poor stuff. I'd already seen the original film many years ago, as well as the sequel, but I somehow avoided this one until just tonight, in the year 2006. I wish I had put it off a few more decades.To pad out the run time to feature length, the movie opens with a long sequence from the last film that is completely unnecessary, because it doesn't show us anything we need to know in order to make sense of the rest. I'm not implying the rest of the movie does makes sense, just that you don't need the flashback sequence. It's only there because the movie would be too short without it.Then we get the murder of a random couple who just happen to operate a small general store in the vicinity of Camp Crystal Lake. You'd think that with all the dismemberment and bloodshed that seem to be a hazard of the area, there wouldn't be any people left there, let alone a store, but there it is. In a scene that seems to be played for laughs, we see a man murdered shortly after sitting on the toilet (which features fairly accurate sound effects). I hope you like seeing men take a dump, because this movie takes you into dirty outhouses with skeezy looking men twice. But anyway, this guy has a deliberately obnoxious wife who looks like she's about 21 and yet wears curlers in her hair and does knitting, probably because the filmmakers thought knitting would make her look like an old shrew. She's watching a news bulletin on TV about how they just discovered eight hacked-up bodies just down the road. The newscast informs her that the killer is still on the loose. This alarms her, but not so much that she feels she must alert her husband and stay behind locked doors. She instead decides it's a good time to go out and collect the laundry hanging from clotheslines in the back yard. Then the murders happen. He gets cleavered, she gets knitting-needled.Yes, a massacre that features at least eight bodies seems to get by everybody in these parts, because pretty soon we have another group of young people going out into the vicinity of Camp Crystal Lake to spend some time in the secluded rural area. Even though the female lead (in other words, the one we know will survive until the end) once had an encounter near that very cabin with a deformed man who tried to kill her with a knife, she doesn't seem to put two and two together, even when she drives right by the police removing the two bodies from the general store (kicking up that body count a notch).That's why I say this movie is like a comedy. Nobody in it behaves like a thinking human being. None of the conversations seem realistic, or like anything real people would say to each other. One especially ridiculous scene occurs when two of our protagonists (and I use that term loosely) encounter a trio of ill-mannered bikers at the grocery store (NOT the store where the murders took place, fortunately). I dare you to believe this scene for one minute, or the halloween-quality biker costumes the unfortunate actors are forced to wear.Let's see, what else sucks about this movie? Oh yeah, the gore. Once the killing starts, it looks really fake. One guy's eye pops out of his head with a wire attached to it. Someone gets a harpoon in the eye, which looks pretty fake. Someone is macheted down the middle, yet we see the body later and it's been cut in half at the waist. A red hot poker goes through someone's body. None of it looks real or shocking, because the director's game plan for suspense goes like this the character is alone. They are unaware of danger. A random sound suddenly startles them. They look around and perhaps call out _______, is that you? Then there's a false scare. Then we get either a dumb laugh (oh, it's just the boyfriend/girlfriend/funny fat guy!) or a murder (ho hum). When the survivor goes out in a canoe at the end, you know what's gonna happen next, and it does a monster jumps out of the water and grabs her. This time it's the rotting body of Mrs. Voorhees, whose head seems to have been mysteriously re-attached post-mortem. Huh? Then as the police take our now-bonkers heroine away in a squad car, the camera pans over to Jason's body, lying there with an axe in its head. Here's where the body moves and gets up, right? Wrong. It just lies there. What the hell? This just might be the most pathetic horror movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them. In retrospect, Friday the 13th Part III seems more like a boring cousin of the Scream series. There are so many slasher clichés in it that we think This has got to be a joke. Somehow, I think they were serious.

The start here differs to allow you to see Jason (sorry, he died as a child in the 1st movie so this isn't him) as still alive.The newscaster tells us 8 bodies were found (I only counted 7 murders that I could remember from my review of pt 2), as they were saying the assistant was the only person to live (so they forgot about the boss and the guy who was left at the bar and the dog).1st dead is a totally innocent shopkeeper, closely followed by his wife (I assume, we never see her killed). Now this is clearly the next day so this is no longer Friday the 13th. It's now Saturday the 14th. So no need for Jason to go killing as it's not the anniversary of his death.Now we have a new bunch of people (mainly stoners) going to a place called Higgens Haven and if they say where this is in relation to Crystal Lake then I never heard them.After pissing off 3 bikers in the local town, they soon reappear stealing gas from the truck of the campers. the biker girl is killed next (in the barn, unseen by us) along with her 2 male cronies. The girl whose family owns the cabin finally tells us she was attacked by this unknown terrible looking man (we're supposed to assume it's Jason), although she says he caught her and was dragging her away and she blacked out but she's still alive? Not Jason's M.O. at all that, is it?.Frizzy haired Joker Shelley is next to be attacked (off camera in the barn we assume) and this is how Jason acquires his now infamous hockey mask and he kills the snooty woman with a harpoon next. The couple who were left in the house having sex are the next victims to die, 1st the boy and the girl is killed in the hammock.When the power goes out, the stoner guy goes to check and gets electrocuted for his troubles by Hockeymask. Shelley shows up to try and warn stoner girl only to be ignored and die in the doorway from his slit throat. She is impaled with a red hot poker.Rick gets his neck broken leaving only the girl whose family who owns the cabin left alive out of the group. She discovers one of her friends dead in the bath and finds a dead biker in a tree. Ricks body is thrown into the cabin through a window, she discovers yet another dead friend in her airing cupboard.She stabs Hockeymask in his hand and knee (he cries out in pain both times so is NOT superhuman). For someone recently stabbed in the knee, Hockeymask walks down the stairs with NO hint of any injury.When she finally tries the truck we all know it's going nowhere as the biker gang siphoned all the fuel in the day time before they all died. The bridge breaking a plank was an obvious thing to happen as they'd taken great pains to show us the loose planks when they 1st drove across it earlier that day.When Hockeymask is hung from the barn that should have killed him. I totally agree with her You can't be alive statement (the drop on the rope would have broken his neck) and the pointless reveal of his face was to allow her to remember the face of her old attacker from the woods 2 years ago.The black biker turns out to have not been dead but is killed very quickly (while she makes NO attempt to escape, why?). Hitting Hockeymask in the head with an Axe also would have killed him.The scene of her escaping on the canoe is supposed to remind us of the original movie and it's fake scare (we are now in Sunday the 14th, by the way) and the various non-scares of her hitting the log, being spooked by a duck landing then seeing the very alive and injured Jason without the mask screams this a dream. Especially when she's dragged into the water by dead Mrs Voorhees (who has a head, despite being decapitated in the original) and it dissolves to the cops talking like the other 2 movies did.The final shot of Jason shows him looking bloodied with stabbed knee, hand and Axe still in his head looking very dead indeed and unlikely to be rising for any sequel.

Okay, the acting in the other two first FRIDAYS wasn't stellar too but in FT13P3, they spend loads of time on the actors acting and everyone is painfully bad. Imagine Soap Opera level of acting but 10 times worse! Yep, it's that bad. Coupled with the nails-to-the-board dialogue, having to watch these losers for what seems to be an eternity is akin to torture. Dana Kimmell wins the award of most expressions in a single scene she's inquisitive, introspective, contemplative, sad, happy, giddy, sassy, sexy, in love, plucky, shocked, terrified in one 60 second stretch of film! Image having to watch her for 90 minutes. Another truly annoying thing about her is she often talks to herself (I don't know what kind of games you guys are playing but I don't like it, she says with a pout). The flashback scene alone is worthy of the worst acted scene ever award. And to make things even more dreadful (as if the latter wasn't enough), Kimmell is peppered with an endless series of false scares, something like 15 or 20 false scares! And that doesn't include the other false scares the other characters are subjected to. And when Kimmell screams, and she screams a lot, she sometimes sounds like she's having an orgasm. The mind boggles!Like all slashers epics, the characters are just types the cute and perky virgin (Kimmell), the horny young hunk, the pot smoking hippie, the fat nerd who likes to play pranks. And most annoying of all, the Mae West like sexy broad (she looks like Jennifer Aniston) who talks with a low voice and always dispenses witty repartee (Was it you, me or the hammock?). BTW, she's also pregnant, making her the first pregnant FRIDAY THE 13TH victim to be skewered by Jason. Nice, huh?The subplot of the biker gang is just padding (and more stupid victims for Jason to butcher). The scene at the store where the two youngsters meets the three gang members is terrible. The disco version of the FRIDAY THE 13TH theme playing in the background doesn't help. Where's Jason when you REALLY need him? Quick, kill them now, not later! One of the actors playing a biker looks like Scott Thompson. It's hilarious.This is supposed to be a horror flick and yet it's not scary for one second. A bored looking Jason dispenses his victims with all the enthusiasm of a janitor duly killing cockroaches infesting his sector. Watching Jason repeatedly killing these types is excruciatingly dull. It's anti-horror. It doesn't elicit shock, horror or even suspense. It's as compelling as watching someone working on a factory line and with quotas to fill. There are only two good money shots in FT13P3, the one where the guy walks on his hands gets chopped between the legs and the scene where the hispanic girl gets a harpoon in the eye. Even without the 3D, these scenes are effective. But the rest is a total waste of time! Many of the killings don't even make any sense and the multiple surprise ending is pure schlock.FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 is so bad, without even realizing it, it's a true post-modern creation. Every scene is so clichéd or badly acted or derivative or choreographed workman-like to nth degree that one can easily take the whole film apart like a puzzle and rearrange the order of the scenes, extend them, loop them, or simply let them stand on their own and it wouldn't make any difference. Some scenes are pure minimalism with nothing but a character calling out another character's name for several minutes (Andy... Andy...Andy?). And because FT13P3 was originally shot in 3D, many scenes start or end with or are simply about objects being propelled at the audience (wow a yo-yo!), making for pointless moments. And the look of the film, grainy and really ugly and plastic throughout (most likely due to the type of lighting needed for the 3D effect) only makes the whole thing even more fantastically bad.

So here's Part 3, in which Jason gets his hockey mask; that's the only interesting thing about it, unless you count the fact that it was shot in 3D.The strange thing about the 3D is that rather than the effect being used on the scenes in which various 2D characters are murdered with knives, machetes and hot pokers, the film-makers instead concentrate on yo-yos, popcorn and juggling balls. Entire sequences are built around this gimmick and it's utterly baffling that a film as sleazy and empty as this one didn't take advantage of the opportunity to increase the trash factor.Aside from that it's nothing we haven't seen in the other films, with boring set-ups leading to the expected bloody pay-offs, although it's all a bit nastier and grimier than before. There's not much to recommend this rather disheartening experience, other than the short running time.

Although many credit Thomas Edison's THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY as the first attempt. By and large, 3-D is usually a sign of filmmaker desperation. They know that their work is a bomb, so they decide to use 3-D in hopes of jazzing it up. Mind you, there are some good ones the Vincent Price flick HOUSE OF WAX being at the top of my list. But for every good one, there are ten bad ones JAWS 3-D and the MY BLOODY VALENTINE remake, anyone? Fascinating, every thirty years or so, there seems to be a renewed craze in 3-D. First, there was the 50s. Then the 80s. And now in the early 2000s. Deep in the heart of 1982, the Friday the 13th franchise was starting to flourish. Of the original four FT13 movies, this one is my least favorite. Don't think I didn't like it. If nothing else, this movie should be noted as the one where Jason adopted his hockey mask! The movie opens with five minutes of padding, I mean, footage from Part II, another sign of filmmaker desperation in fact. And then for the next ten minutes, it drags through one of the slowest openings in slasher history. We're introduced to a disgusting middle-aged couple who bicker and argue. At this point, I wanted to turn into Jason and hack them up myself. In terms of 3-D, we get an occasional object thrown or held towards the camera. But take out those shots and the movie is still a piece of well-made crap. In terms of favorite characters, mine is the fat dork named Shelly. If only they had fleshed his character out more! And what is the deal with the two aging hippies, or the mixed-race biker gang of three? For early 80s entertainment, watch this for laughs with a group of your funniest friends!

But part 3 has two special things. It is available as 3D on the Deluxe Edition and I must say, it worked out fine. Sometimes the 3D doesn't match and you see some faults but overall it is a nice feature, for example the famous speer coming at you really works. Another thing that became iconic is just the fact when the movie is exactly 60 minutes going on, Jason appears with the hockey mask. Sadly it takes again way too long before things really happens and the, I call it remake of the ending of part 1 does makes it feel a bit shitty. Also here for the first time Jason has some supernatural power by squeezing a head with his bare hands.

But the old-school aesthetic it shares with the first four Friday films offers it an air of nostalgia that at least makes the film a fun ride. Alhough, the less said about the quasi-disco opening theme, the better. (Naturally, I had to track down a vinyl copy of the soundtrack). Working very hard against any opportunity for this movie to distinguish itself in the series is the assortment of bodies on Jason's smörgåsbord, who are far and away the most ridiculous group of future victims to grace not only a F13 film, but perhaps any slasher film ever made. Even if you can deal with a pair of potheads who appear to be twice as old as anyone else in the group, and who offer un-needed and un-funny stoner humor throughout the kill-fest, you still have to contend with Fox, Loco, and Ali, the lamest and least intimidating biker gang to ever set foot on a movie screen. The film is notable for being the entry in which we see Jason don his iconic hockey mask for the first time. Unfortunately, said mask is inadvertently provided to him by a cloying d-bag named Shelly, perhaps the most infamous character in the Friday franchise. Shelly spends the majority of the film instigating funny pranks like sneaking up behind people and stabbing them with rubber knives, and faking his own death, and his witty apex comes late in the film when he dons a hockey mask and sets out to impress the girl he likes by trying to pull her into the water, then lunging out and attacking her with a spear-gun. A brilliant strategy, this. Nothing steals a girl's heart like pretending you're going to kill her.In a franchise that demands we accept the unacceptable, Shelly is the most problematic wild card. You see, I can suspend my disbelief and play along with the idea that Jason can be chopped, stabbed, maimed, hung, etc. and recover from his wounds unscathed. I can force myself to ignore the logistical improbabilities of Jason's ability to stage corpses in such a manner that they fall from a tree at the precise moment our heroine is standing by the tree. I can even begrudgingly concede that it's remotely possible for a killer to operate in a self-contained area with an identical modus operandi for several films and still not elicit any suspicion or vigilance from law enforcement. What I can NOT accept is that a character as unlikeable and annoying as Shelly could not only find and maintain a group of friends who endure his insufferably lame antics, but that anyone would invite him along on a road trip that would necessitate being stuck in the middle of nowhere with him for an entire weekend. That, ladies and gentlemen, is just too hard to swallow.I have yet to mention the 3-D gimmick, which was sort of negated until very recently, when this chapter was finally issued on DVD in its original form. The effects aren't really all that spectacular, despite the fact that the film-makers latched onto any opportunity they could to throw snakes, eyeballs, yo-yos, and pitchforks at the screen. These jump effects are far too clunky to have any impact, even with the 3-D process employed. However, the 3-D presentation offers some improvement, since on the film's original two-dimensional home video release, these scenes just looked stupid. Surprisingly, the more subtle dimensional effects are far more impressive, such as rows of clotheslines blowing in the wind as Jason lurks behind them, and the final haunting shot of the seemingly tranquil lake. Since there aren't a lot of 3-D films available on DVD, this tactic certainly offers an experience that makes the film worth checking out despite its glaring flaws.One particularly mean-spirited aspect of the film that gets glossed over is the revelation that one of our characters is pregnant. Perhaps the film-makers didn't think that this disposable piece of character development was all that important, but the idea of Jason butchering a pregnant woman is inherently worse than him killing a score of obnoxious teens. It also confuses things when you're trying to tally up the body count here. Do we count the fetus as a victim, or is there some sort of asterisk designation involved? The ending is particularly dicey, attempting to recapture the classic final boo of the original Friday The 13th by having Mrs. Voorhees leap out of the lake and pull lone survivor Chris into the water. There are a couple of possibilities to make sense of how this improbable scenario could have happened. One is, quite simply, Mrs. Voorhees leaped out the lake and pulled lone survivor Chris into the water, although that fails to explain how Pamela's severed head moved from the shrine Jason adorned with it and reattached itself to her decapitated body. The other possibility is that Chris was merely dreaming this happened, or that it was a hallucination borne from her traumatized mind. Only problem there is that Chris has no idea who Jason is, let alone who Mrs. Voorhees is, and she has no knowledge of the legend of Crystal Lake. Can you hallucinate being attacked by someone you don't even know exists? This is never explained, and those who took the reigns for future installments wisely left this twist in the dust. Although, the final scene when we see Chris completely paralyzed with madness brought on by her ordeal is a nifty little fade to black.The series would eventually get much worse than this, but Part 3 is not even remotely a high point in the Friday franchise. Recommended for completists and those interested in the 3-D aspect, but this is assuredly the worst of the classic and otherwise solid original Friday quartet.

Jason is shadowed enough for the first half of the movie to avoid diminishing the terror, something today's flicks don't respect. The acting was a little spotty, but this film still has a campy feel. The actors who did the best in this installment were Tracie Savage and Dana Kimmell. Jeffrey Rogers was OK, but the others were pretty bland. What is respectful about 3 is the nudity was there, but minimized and it was more situational, rather than sensationalistic. The only nude actress (Savage) was showering, and we are wondering if Jason is going to butcher her next. It was kind of interesting and iconic the way Andy was walking on his legs, foreshadowing his potential fate. Debbie's death was subtle and terrorizing, as we felt the horror creep up on us as the blood dropped. Chris was pretty determined to take out her assailant, dumping a bookshelf on him, stabbing him in the hand and knee, knocking him over the head with a log, hanging him and eventually axing him. She seemed fairly smart, even going for her vehicle where many of these movies have girls running instead. Unlike almost every sequel filmed, this one didn't involve rain, but another terrorizing weather force, wind. Overall, very good!

One of them has a hackneyed back story about being chased by Jason as a younger girl that isn't particularly interesting or memorable but gets the job done.The characters are all annoying and predictable. I couldn't care a less about any of their lives by the end. In fact I only remembered one of their names simply because he was the one who brought the hockey mask to the camp (I believe his name was Shelly). It doesn't help that they are all acted by complete incompetents. After Amy Steel in the second movie the Last Girl in this one really had a lot to live up to but she ultimately failed. I will cut the actors some slack, as there isn't a hell of a lot you can do with a script that god awful.Essentially this movie boils down to an hour and a half of badly scripted, badly acted 80s trash that is only barely scary and will probably bore you to death.Review For Friday FansFewwwwwww.

Whether it is Jason getting his hands stuck in a car window, or a blatant rip-off of 'Psycho', you cannot help but occasionally chuckle at Steve Miner's sloppy film making (no wonder he was not hired for part iv). Even the idea about how Jason gets the hockey mask is ridiculous and random. I'm guessing that Miner was probably in a store one day, saw a rack of those masks, and thought to himself, gee these things look scary, wouldn't it be great if we could integrate this into the movie. It's the little things in life (and film) that cause the big problems. Friday the 13th part III is the ideal movie to prove this point. It's not terrible, but it won't work for anyone other than die hard fans with little plastic masks and machetes.

There is no doubt that the series is influential, and that every Horror lover should at least see some of the films, but, as far as I am concerned, they are in no way essential, and I must say that, when re-watching the entire series recently after some years, my most prevalent feeling was that of boredom. This third entry to the series is slightly better than Part 2, and yet I couldn't say that the film has anything particularly interesting about it. The most memorable aspect about Friday the 13th Part III (1982) is probably that villainous Jason sports his trademark hockey mask for the first time in this one. Other than that, the film is basically a repetition of the same formula Horny teenage idiots getting butchered by a masked killer, namely Jason Voorhees. That's it. How imaginative. The killings are gorier and more stylish than in Part 2 (which was obviously tamed down due to the controversy over Part 1), and I also hated the teenagers in this one slightly less (except for the idiot named Shelly). For whatever reason, a constantly pot-smoking couple of 30-something Hippies is also traveling with the teens. Then again, Jason's motives are even more obscure than in Part 2, as his victims in this film are neither working, nor even staying at Camp Crystal Lake. Seems like he just took a shine in butchering teenagers, no matter what their occupation is. My favorite character in the film was a crazy old guy with a long beard carrying a severed eyeball. Crystal lake looks completely different than in the previous parts. The lake looks smaller in this one, the ambiance looks more southern, and there's less forest, which is a minus in my book. As always, there's a sole survivor of Jason's massacre in this one. In the end she dreams of Mrs. Voorhees coming out of the lake and grabbing her, as Jason did in the end of the first part. This is utterly idiotic, as she doesn't know who Jason is, and therefore couldn't possibly have any idea about his mother. Overall, Friday the 13th is another silly and utterly unoriginal entry to this generally overrated series, but I cannot claim that it isn't enjoyable on a certain level. However, if you want to watch a Friday the 13th film, it hardly matters which one, as they're basically all the same.

She triumphs in the film's final showdown, but has a bad dream where she is dragged underwater by Mrs Vorhees and goes crazy anyway.The effects in this are poor, worse than the first two. It takes a bit away from a movie when a person supposedly gets knifed in the eye and it is obviously a knife sticking out of a rubber mask.The only reason this movie gets a higher rating than it deserves off me is because this is the film where Jason picks up the hockey mask that would define his character from then on.

Shortly after that he arrives to a farm area where - surprise, surprise - a group of teenagers are having a quality vacation. The third massacre is about to begin...Friday the 13th part 3-D has one of my favorite death sequences in the whole series, which are even more creative than in the previous film, for example a harpoon in the eye, machete sliced vertically through a person's whole body, and the classic head squeezed until eye pops out.The characters are obviously ridiculous, at least the tough guys at a grocery store who eventually end up in the same farm as the teenagers and get killed by Jason for being total dumb asses (pitch fork in the neck, stomach and wrench in the face).In the end Jason gets an axe in his head by the last survivor - who just by coincidence happens to be a female - and dies for real.

This movie seemed very slow paced with plenty of scenes which would have been awesome in 3-D, but not at all interesting in a flat format.Friday the 13th Part 3 DOES have some very good and violent kills.

This has, however, come to be expected from the series. I liked the side story about the small biker gang stalking the kids, except when looking at it in another way, it was just a gimmick used to fill time.

Friday the 13th Part 3 is pared down to the fundamental essentials of the subgenre, and is all the better for it. Because it was originally filmed in 3D, it is blatantly clear that significantly more time was spent on getting the effects right than fleshing out the characters and storyline. In any other genre, this would sink a movie, but not in a slasher film. Friday the 13th Part 3 graciously spares us the hackneyed idea of Jason actually surviving the drowning in the lake and coming back to avenge his mother's death and instead turns him into an anonymous killer. Indeed, Jason's name is never uttered, not even once, during the ENTIRE film (unless you count the archival footage from the previous film tacked onto the beginning). The complete lack of a backstory for Jason thus augmented his frightening mythos and, combined with his acquisition of the trademark hockey mask in this film, put him on the trajectory towards becoming one of the major pop culture icons of the 1980s.Our heroine Dana Kimmell is a terrible actress -- just watch her diorite-encased delivery of the line, You go ahead. I'm going to take my bags in the house first and look around. However, she is strikingly beautiful in that glitzy '80s soap star way, and she manages to hit some nice congenial notes that suit the Final Girl trope well (plus, Amy Steel, the Final Girl from Part 2, is an impossible act to follow). And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Larry Zerner, who, as the portly and piteous practical joker Shelly won the hearts of millions of Friday the 13th fans -- who, incidentally, tend to be rather portly and piteous themselves (okay, don't kill me for this, fanboys -- I really am on your side, I promise).If it wasn't for Amy Steel's stunning performance in Part 2, Friday the 13th Part 3 would easily be the best sequel in this lengthy series. It is condensed slasher goodness with less filling. It is the archetypical Friday film. It is, from what I hear, quite a treat in all its 3D glory. It is genius in its stupidity.

Friday the 13th Part 3D is the best in the series, and that may not mean a lot to most people, but to a slasher fan it is certainly a blessing.Friday the 13th Part 3D is most famous for introducing the world to the iconic hockey mask, which as not only come to define the series but come to symbolize the genre as a whole. Anyone who truly loves horror movies should definitely see the film where the hockey mask comes into play. The story is pretty much the same as the first two films - it takes place directly after the events of Part 2 with Jason on the run and hiding out in a barn on Crystal Lake that is occupied by a group of college kids. Also on the barn are a biker gang that truly do make the movie. Dana Kimmell shines as the heroine of the story, and she certainly lands her mark as one of the most likable heroines in horror history. There really aren't any famous faces in this entry, with the exception of Newscaster Tracy Savage who plays Kimmell's best friend.The film really defines the 80's in its own way. You have every type of character; the country boy, the pretty girl, the tough biker chick, the abusive biker, the biker gang leader, the obnoxious wife, the bizarre animal-loving husband, the two stoner's, the bitchy beauty, the athletic fellow, the final girl, the nut-case carrying around body parts, and of course the prankster outcast who was the one to introduce the famous mask. 80's fans will also enjoy the musical theme, which isn't so much a standard horror theme but more of a disco theme that will make you giggle at the time period. The direction is very good and at times the movie manages to be suspenseful, even on today's standards.Friday the 13th Part 3D is available in a single bare-bones DVD with just a trailer or it is available in the From Crystal Lake to Manhattan box set with the first eight Friday the 13th films. In the box set you get a commentary by select cast members including Kimmell, a trailer, a featurette dedicated to this one film, and a lot of extras for the whole series. If you have the money the box set is worth it, but its still a shame that this film can't be presented in its original 3D format. Rumor has it that some DVD's have managed to put this format, however those DVD's generally go for very, very needy prices.

If your not familiar with the series then you should know that this is the one in which Jason gets his trademark hockey mask. For the first half of the movie you don't see anything above his chest. Though this one is an important part of the series, it is not quite as good as the other first four in the series. That's not to take away from the fun of the movie as this one has some extremely memorable moments.The story starts right where part 2 left off. Ginny (only surviver of part 2) is getting taken to the hospital thus ending her tale. The police start a search for the killer and have no trace. Of course, Jason starts killing immediately. Now we introduce the teen characters to be slaughtered. They seem to be on vacation and decide to stay at an old barn house. A perfect place for a massacre.Pretty standard for a slasher movie. Some of the ups for this movie are the gore scenes and the fact that this movie was released in the theaters in 3-d. I was a bit to young to see this one in the theaters but I can imagine it would have been a lot of fun. The few scenes of gore are side splitting hilarious. A scene where a guy walking upside down is almost to funny as Jason makes short work of him and the scene where Jason decides to crush this poor saps head is probably the funniest moment in all of the Jason films.The downs for the movie are only very few. I am sure that seeing this in 3-d was completely awesome but it seeing without the 3-d effect is kind of sad because most of the movie has things that jump out at the screen and what not. Without the 3-d effect it just looks incredibly goofy. Also, the opening music that plays with the credits is just so eighties. I like the eighties but man, stick with the original theme. At least they didn't change the rest of the music as we here the original score for most of the movie.This is a must see for the fan of the Friday the 13th series.

I like the scenes where you can see the back of Jason watching his victims. And in the beginning when he's behind the barn door you can barely see his face. The camera effects did a superb job.Dana Kimmel was sexy! Richard Brooker did the best in any sequel playing Jason. He was flawless, intimidating and huge! And his face was perfectly scary and evil. In my opinion, they should have ended the saga in Part III. I thought part IV,(the final chapter) was worthless. It was boring and dragged out. The ending was the only action in the film. They should have extended F13 Part III about 15 minutes longer and killed him in a more violent way.The music in this one is almost equivalent to part 1. Awesome!! What I hated about part 4, is that Jason looked totally different. Black Fingernails and a totally different face.Part III his fingernails were clean. You didn't see much of Jason in part 4, and the acting was terrible. There was no spark in part 4. Part 2 was good as well. The first 3 had a plot and suspense to the movie.

This time, one girl has already faced the monster, and she must face him again. Couldn't stay away, could she?First of all I must say that I'm a big fan of the series. The original is a classic of the genre but the sequels are hit or miss. Director Steve Miner, who did a good job on part 2, struggles a bit this time around. No doubt the fact that this film was shot with 3-D in mind helps to hinder the film's look. The extreme closeups probably looked swell in theatres back in '82 but now look kinda hokey.Pacing is rather off, as well. While Parts 1 and 2 had mostly pointless middle sections, the one here goes by rather painfully. Perhaps the fault lies mostly with the characters, here they're not interesting at all. Potentially funny moments are wasted, like the two junkies who look like they're going to provide some comedy relief but don't. The actors are way below average this time around as well. Dana Kimmell (who reportedly had some influence in downsizing the film's gore) looks pretty enough but her acting talents are mostly confined to screaming a lot. At least she does that well. Paul Kratka has to be a huge contender for the worst actor in the series, his performance is bad beyond words. I bet most people are cheering Jason on when he's crushing his skull. All others are pretty bad as well, the two junkies seem to fare best. And those bikers...pretty lame.One other thing, not really the film's fault, but rather those blasted MPAA pruners; It's drastically cut and it hurts the film badly. You can clearly see some sloppy editing at the time when some gore seems to be coming and it's terribly annoying (but this is mostly evident in the British cut of the film).But not all is bad. Once Jason gets going the film comes to life and Miner manages to extract a decent amount of suspense. The cinematography looks good in a widescreen version and it makes quite a bit of difference. Plus it's here that Jason dons the fine mask.Now, if only they'd release an unrated version of this film and maybe in it's full 3-D incarnation I'd be a happy camper.

It's just like the previous entries; plotless and often tedious, but with fairly entertaining climaxes. I have to admit the ending made me jump once, and the next-to-last scene actually managed to grip me. However, up till then, I kept getting impatient, waiting for things to get going. After dispatching that white-trash couple, Jason doesn't even kill any of these young people till the movie is nearly half-over. In the interim, we have to put up with that awful motorcycle gang, which is a subplot introduced merely to provide Jason with more fresh bodies; at least they get killed off before annoying us too much. Still, the deaths themselves aren't too bad. Best of the lot the part with the spear-gun.This is the very first film where Jason wears his now-legendary hockey mask, since revered as one of the icons of horror. It is interesting to note that the infamous killer is still more or less human at this point in the series. Towards the end, he is stabbed, and actually shrieks in pain. It's a far cry from the nearly invulnerable undead Jason who would haunt the later sequels. It even strongly implies that he has raped the heroine in the recent past. While few have cared to ponder his sexuality, it is certainly plausible that part of his rage stems from repressing his basic urges.Friday the 13th, Part 3 arguably has the best-looking heroine in the bunch, played by Dana Kimmell. At this point, it is very well-known that she had requested that the producers cut down on all the violent and sexual material in the script. If that is the case, one wonders why she agreed to appear in the film at all. Didn't she know that it's a slasher movie, and that people would expect graphic violence? Still, she does an okay job, at least for this type of movie. The young characters are at least more sympathetic than their counterparts in subsequent sequels. I was amused by the presence of an aging hippie, obviously a homage to Cheech and Chong.Looking at some of the shots, it's clear that the film was originally intended to be viewed in 3-D. I am aware that some midnight theaters still show it in this format. I suppose it plays better that way, but it's still a gimmick that obscures the fact that otherwise it's just an ordinary slasher that doesn't carry the series in any new or unexpected direction. And is it just me, or do all cheesy 1980's horror sequels have to have flashbacks? Is this a law or something? Most of the Friday the 13th movies had them. Even Hellbound Hellraiser II did.

The film was released during the new interest in 3-D movies in the early 1980's, and was a success at the box office. Once again the plot is very simple (possible SPOILERS ahead) Jason of Friday The 13th, Part 2, continues his rampage of gruesome murders close to the lake where he just slaughtered several people at a summer camp. This time he stalks a married couple at their grocery store home, a trio of bikers, and a group of young adults spending the weekend at a country home. Chris (Dana Kimmell), the main character, was attacked by Jason a few years before. Little does Chris know people are being murdered, and she will soon have to fight for her life. A highlight of this movie was the excellent 3-D. The depth in the scenes created by the 3-D process was excellent throughout the movie! The opening credits were simplistic as the cast and crew's names are presented in 3-D, but yet fun and well done. The opening credits also feature the funky, fun, disco-like Theme From Friday The 13th, Part 3. Some of the 3-D effects that were to pop off of the screen, and come at the audience included a baseball bat, a rat, a yo-yo, popping popcorn, a snake, an eyeball that is held out in someone's hand, and an eyeball that pops out of someone's head. Most of the 3-D effects were well done. The gore effects looked gruesome and real for the most part (from the theatrical viewing experience, and not from viewing on video or DVD where you can freeze or play in slow motion to see how fake some of these effects look.) However, even on the big screen a couple of the gore effects looked unrealistic. There are a couple continuity errors between Friday The 13th, Part 2, and this one. One contradiction is Jason's appearance Jason is a much larger man in this film, and he has no hair. Harry Manfredini's original music helps set the mood as it did in the first two films. The change of setting from a summer camp to a country home with a barn makes the atmosphere of this film somewhat different than in the first two films, but this change does not seem to hurt. The acting is more balanced on an average level in this part, but Dana Kimmell (Chris) doesn't seem to be able to pull off here scenes of upset as her character remembers being previously attacked. Kimmell does very well with her scenes of terror, but the more dramatic parts in this film are not her best. Friday The 13th, Part 3 3-D does attempt to give the main characters a little more character development, but it is clear to see this film goes more for fast thrills than substance. The last shock in which Chris is pulled into the water by Jason's previously decapitated mother is a fast thrill low point. Friday The 13th, Part 3 3-D was a breakthrough film for 3-D advancement, but not a solid or totally entertaining production. Still, the film was more entertaining than many of the other slasher-type movies released in its era.

When a group of teens converge on the lot to spend the weekend, Jason sets out to dismember them one by one, using whatever he can get his hands on to put them away, while donning his trademark hockey mask for the first time. Highy enjoyable third entry, to the long running & very entertaining slasher series, this time does all it's gory business in some rather fantastically done 3D effects. What makes F13TH PART III, work even after repeated viewings & what I feels keeps the film fresh, is the atmosphere, the creative kills, (& the already mentioned 3D effects) & great performance by RICHARD BROOKER as Jason (Jason's never been more terrifying than he has been here!) Like GUNNAR HANSEN'S performance as LEATHERFACE, in the original THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, Brooker is able to invoke a disturbing presence when he is on screen, that is not easily shaken & stays with you no matter how many times you see the film & goes to show what a talent Brooker really is, as he is able to pull off such a feat for a monster who's face we only see for roughly a minute through the whole film & who never once utters a word, while at the same time wearing a mask to conceal his looks, Brooker, in what is surely one of the best, if not the best performances of any of the Jason actors, could so easily have played the role with almost no acting whatsoever, but he is able to convey all of Jason's actions & emotions just perfectly, not an easy feat for a faceless & non talking movie monster. What a shame he never played more monsters after this!. The suspense really shines here, with director STEVE MINER able to pull off some pretty good edge of your seat thrills & chills in many scenes, that still hold up despite constant viewings. All that aside however, the film does have a few faults, most notably in the wooden acting, with many of the actors looking much to old to be playing teenagers (Like Chuck & Chili, who look well into their thirties!) & just like his work in Part 2, Miner & company seem to be to afraid to shy away from the formula established in Cunningham's original classic. Like Part 2, the film is a complete remake of the first film, this film even more so than Miners last outing, simply because many of the scenes & scenarios that were played out in the first film, is redone here, such as a victim who falls from a tree right in front of the heroine, a crazy old man who warns of the dangers of Crystal Lake, the stock characters you usually see in films like this, the practical joker who pulls one to many stunts on his pals only to be ignored when he really is set to bite the big one, heck even some of the deaths from the first are repeated here! The ending of the first film is also ripped off, as we see the heroine dragged into the lake by a person long thought dead (the first film had Jason pulling a stunned Alice into the waters, this one Mrs. Voorhees) perhaps this is the most disappointing part of the film, since it doesn't make a lick of sense, for starters, Chris, the lead heroine, doesn't know who Jason is, doesn't know the legend, if she knew of the legend, the ending would certainly be understandable, you could say she dreamt about his mother coming back for revenge (Mrs. Voorhees is seen here as a corpse that looks like she's been underwater for the past five years & oddly has her head still attached to the shoulders & not rotting away on a altar like we seen in Part 2!). But again since she doesn't, it makes for not only a confusing, but really lousy ending. Now I understand that Miner & company thought this would be the final entry & probably did the scene to make audiences wonder if Mrs. Voorhees would come back to avenge her son's death yet again, but since there were tons of sequels afterwards it's really lame, making one wish that the filmmakers used one of the alternate endings instead especially the one that see's Chris decapitated by the masked maniac, in a scene that was reminiscent of Alice decapitating Mrs. Voorhees, only with maniac killing the heroine instead. It makes one wonder just how much this would have made the equally scary & entertaining fourth instalment, all the more scary & suspenseful, since with Alice, the heroine of the first dead, Ginny left for dead & her boyfriend Paul killed in Part 2 & if Chris would have died here, how much more terrified would we feel for the fate of the brother & sister as they were being terrorized at the end of Part 4, would Jason kill them like he did to Alice, Paul, Rick & Chris? It makes you think...All that aside however, F13TH PART 3 makes for a highly enjoyable viewing experience, if you can look past the bad acting, daft dialogue & repetitive storyline, you should find this highly amusing & scary.

The characters make the movie somewhat light and bearable and the movie obviously doesn't take itself as seriously as the previous two installments did.As you can expect from a movie of its kind, the movie is being filled with some graphic deaths, that are nice to watch for the fans of horror and gore but of course aren't all very surprising anymore.What I didn't really liked about this movie was the portrayal of Jason. It shows that you can not just put any actor under the mask to make his character threatening and scary. Also his look differs so much from the first two movies that it becomes quite distracting. They probably did this to avoid confusion with the Halloween movies, in which the killer has a sort of similar look and hockey mask. Jason in this movie never works out as a scary or threatening character, perhaps also because he gets featured, full frontal, in too many sequences. In the first movie there still was mystery and suspense because you never actually got to see the killer until the end. The second movie already abandoned this but it still knew to create and threatening, dangerous, murderer, that above all also had a good look, even though he was wearing a ridicules sack over his head.It's more of the same, only in 3D this time.

I saw the original as a kid and recently re-watched it with the second nearly back to back and only after watching this third installment am I actually excited to watch the rest. I found the first two to be simply okay in terms of watching a movie in the year 2006. This movie was great. I rated this movie based on its appeal and enjoyment as a movie-watching experience. I am sad and ashamed to say I wasn't able to enjoy it's 3D features as intended, but they were great nonetheless. This movie is full of hilariously enjoyable 3D gags with or without any glasses or a big screen. Each kill is unique and interesting. Unlike many other horror movies (especially of its era), this movie doesn't spend a torturous amount of time developing character for people you don't care about nor go obnoxiously slow at any given point. If you're looking for another Jason movie, this is obviously an answer. If you enjoy a hearty laugh while watching someone get an object lodged through some twenty-something year old you don't care about, this movie is for you. In fact, I'm not going to bother to comment on story further than to say that I was very much entertained all the way through and if you're interested in this movie for great plot and character development, look elsewhere... look to a doctor because you should know better.

This film is the one that gave Jason his hockey mask and put him into the nightmares of children for decades to come. Dana Kimbell does a great job in this film as Chris the new last girl. She even gives Jason something to remember by, with the famous Ax Cut wound to the head she inflicts on Jason giving him a chip on his mask that is still there today even though he has changed out masks no less than three times sine then. Richard Broker as Jason does a fine job in all the murder scenes and the walk he does rules. He does not run like the last guy. Richard is third only to Kane Hodder who is number one and Ted White who is number 2. Thats good for there having been seven guys to play the role. Now as for Steve Miner, I don't know how he did it. It's certainly a fluke because this is the only good film the man has ever directed. This film being in 3-D takes something away from the DVD edition, but in the theater I'm sure it was something to relish.

I found it amusing how cardboard the characters were.  One scene features two guys juggling. Two other scenes feature a character walking on his hands. You get the feeling the director asked all the actors what tricks they could do, in a desperate attempt to make the characters more interesting. Two of the characters are the stereotypical stoners. One girl is deemed pregnant in a conversation near the beginning- this info sorta distinguishes her from the other women, but the subject is never dealt with again.  We are also treated to two scenes of somebody using a toilet, just another time-filling substitute for actual dialogue.   As lame as the characters are written, I don't think the actors are all that bad. Except for Dana Kimmell's sweater-wearin' boyfriend. His acting is very flat. He sucks, but that's what makes him cool.    The unironic script also treats us to two different characters in two scenes saying the same thing (Where's this coming from?) for different reasons (blood from a body above, water dripping from the floor above). And perhaps the most awkward line is when a girl,speaking of a past run-in with Jason, says he had a knife... and he attacked me with it!.  It's not a hilarious movie, but is funny at times. If you first saw it as a little kid in the '80s, nostalgia can be your ready-made excuse for watching it now.  But anybody else watching this has some serious explaining to do.

No one with a modicum of common sense would approach a movie like this and expect it be any good, in the strictest sense of the word. There are, however, at least two things which one expects to see in a cheesy slasher flick. The first is some serious gore, the second is boobies. Unlike most of the films in the Friday 13th series, this pathetic entry fails to deliver the goods on both counts.The plot is hilarious. It seems that, in spite of the savage murders that occurred at Camp Crystal Lake both last year and the year before (as well as the murders fifteen years earlier), yet another group of unsuspecting and apparently mindless teenagers go to the camp for a bit of fun and frivolity. In a huge twist, Jason returns from the dead - again - and starts killing them.As always, the first seven minutes of the film is just a replay of the last seven minutes of Part 2. One can't help but think that they were trying desperately to bump up the lousy running time, and they still couldn't make it to 90 minutes. If you think that's a rip off, keep watching.The only interesting thing about this film is that this is where Jason pioneered the iconic killer in a hockey mask look, having opted for a hessian sack over his head in the second instalment of the series. This is mildly diverting for about 30 seconds but is a long way from saving this turkey.The murders are all pretty tame here compared to the first two movies. Most of the violence happens off screen as the scenes all cut away just as the blade (or weapon of choice) is about to hit. We get to see the bodies afterwards, but there's nothing even remotely shocking about most of the shots here. The one exception is a body sliced almost in half (from the groin up), delicately balanced on a roof support beam. Personally, I couldn't help thinking what a lot of effort it must have been for Jason to lift the body up there and balance it just right, but by this point I was seriously bored.The real tragedy of this schlock-fest is that, despite the presence of some fairly hot (in an 80s way) teenage girls, none of them get their baps out. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure this is a flagrant violation of horror movie etiquette not to mention the fact that we had all come to expect some boob from this series as if by right! Ultimately, for me, this proved to be the last straw.This is a movie for die hard Jason fans only as it is easily the weakest in the series.

As soon as you hear the twanging disco music over the opening credits you know you're in for a bad night in front of the box. Picking up straight after Part 2's night of carnage, a group of campers (or something like that) head out into a farm/camp thing in Jason country for some weed-smoking and more sex.The characters this time aren't the typical mob of teenage jocks as per the first 2 Friday's. This time, apart from the teens, we have a college geek, 2 hippies, and a really sad looking bunch of bikies. Sounds promising, but these guys aren't interesting in ths slightest. Annoying is more like it, and I was praying that they'd be mown down pretty quickly, but alas, Jason takes his time to get things going.From here on, things travel along much like the last 2 entries in the series. Campers get randy and are picked off one-by-one in the usual disgusting manner by a (this-time) hockey mask clad Jason Voorhees. Unlike part 2, the death scenes are incredibly boring and come about very suddenly with no tension or buildup (much the same way part 1 did). Not only that, they look incredibly fake. Watch for eyes popping out, arms being hacked off and a harpoon through the head for prime examples of this.Speaking of fake, get a load of the flashback sequence towards the middle of the film. This was meant to be a serious scene, but some of the worst acting you'll ever see turns it into one big joke. I think this was about the only time I laughed (or even smiled) the whole time during this piece of trash. Sure, nobody expects oscar-winning performances from these flicks, but there's got to be better than this.And finally, what is it with the vague endings in this series? Setting up for a sequel is one thing, but did they really have to rehash the same thing as the previous films? Worse still, this time the ending defies logic completely if you've seen part 1 and 2, and if you haven't, you'll be wondering what on earth is going on.This was a big disappointment for me.

These movies are an insult to my intelligence, yet I keep coming back for more, mostly because I remember these from being a kid and so they have a nostalgic tug to them.At least this one is the most 80s of the series...it's like a slasher version of Roller Boogie.

But I have to assume that some of the other 3-D effects, like an overhead shot of exploding popcorn (Oh my God, it's coming right at us!) were less than terrifying to experience.Jason outdoes himself with the body count this time around--whole scenes exist for the purpose of introducing someone he can poke, prod or skewer.

Aside from being (quite surprisingly) skilfully photographed in Arri's three-dimensional process, the film has very little to recommend it. Indeed, aside from the unconventional manner in which Jason X was processed, this marks the only episode in the franchise where the photography wasn't strictly by the numbers. No other FT13 director has even attempted to use the 2.351 aspect ratio, and it is quite a surprise to see it used so effectively here.The 3D effects, to give the makers some credit, actually work well. Not in the sense that they enhance the story, but at least to the extent of giving the audience something to be entertained by. The shots of arrows, eyeballs, or yo-yos flying out of the screen are well-realized here. The wide angles, while nothing that the likes of Clint Eastwood or Sergio Leone would be impressed by, still give the film a dynamic missing from its predecessors or successors.Unfortunately, skilled photography and well-realized special effects are not enough to save a film by themselves. Without at least a good story, any film is doomed, and aside from the recent tenth installment, a good story and the FT13 franchise are mutually exclusive. The story content in this episode could have been easily written on a single leaf of A4 paper. Somehow, you have to give a director credit for being able to make ninety-four minutes of feature film out of something so patently uninteresting. Okay, eighty-seven minutes if you discount the stuff that was recycled from the previous film.The acting, as is always the case in an FT13 film, is largely reflective of the script. In other words, you'll find more interesting or convincing performances in your average grade school play. You know a film is garbage when the most memorable performance involves a man sitting on a toilet. Then again, the sound effects and dialogue involved tend to deliver a summary of the film that few other scenes can. Every bit of dialogue here is truly abominable. It seems a trademark of FT13 directors that they cannot even make a conversation about a day's work feel vaguely natural.The characters are probably the worst feature of any FT13 film, but this is an exceptional example. Try to name one unique aspect of the characters shown in this film, and you'll soon see what I mean. If there has ever been a film more reliant on stereotypes to fill character space, I have yet to see it. Probably the funniest characters in the whole film are the biker gang, and they're hardly distinguishable from the rest of the largely white-hat cast.Two stand-out features of this film, widescreen 3D photography aside, are the truly riotous disco music during the opening credits, and this being the episode in which Jason acquires the signature hockey mask. I have to say, however, that with the hilarious break-dancing motif of the opening theme, it would have suited the style a lot better if Jason had held onto the cloth bag.Not surprisingly, I gave the third FT13 film a one out of ten. They were obviously expecting that simple 3D effects would make the film. While this is supposedly the most profitable 3D film ever made (which is nothing to brag about considering how much most others have grossed), history will otherwise not remember this particular 3D film in kind terms.

The 1980s were a big time for theaters to capitalize on the slasher craze that was going on at the time. The best known being Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, Michael Myers and of course Jason Vorhees. All of which these particularly iconic characters had significant entrances respectively. Yet it seems as if so far they all managed to decrease in quality as their subsequent sequels were put into production. Of course not every entry was the same, but at some point the facts in the story began to either contradict itself or totally deny its previous installment. Why haven't these famous production studios paid attention to their competitions' mistakes? Of course, the reason is to make money but really?Like many other third movies to a series, most people end up seeing the flaws and begin to know that the series has run its course. Then again, Part III to this series serves an even more mixed bag than Part II but without being extremely frustrating to watch. The story for this new opening takes place two days after the last movie by showing the aftermath of Part II (interesting how it already contradicts itself by taking place on Sunday the 15th). Here, the audience is introduced to another new set of stock camp characters. Leading the group is Chris (Dana Kimmel) a girl who's trying to confront her fear of returning to the camp (not Crystal Lake) where she had a frightening encounter with Jason. Aside from this particular reason, there isn't much a plot besides this. The writing provided by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson obviously did not think that much of a story was needed. Sadly, more is required though. A good question is what was Jason doing when he ran into Chris? Not explained.Kitrosser and Watson also included two other characters in the group who sounded like they were going to be developed but weren't. These two characters belong to Larry Zerner as Shelly and Catherine Parks as Vera. At the beginning they were supposed to be hitched and do try to get to know each other, but their arc is so short the audience cannot establish an attachment to them. The rest of the characters are the typical bunch seen before. You have the two that are just joining so they can run off and have sex, then there are the drug addicts and even a punk biker gang. It doesn't get more 80s than that. Another gaping issue in the story is the transformation of Jason Vorhees and his newly unexplained powers. In a matter of days, we went to what was a young teen looking for revenge to what is a massive hulking monster (played by Richard Brooker)? How'd he get so large? Also the fact that he is now depicted as a superhuman brings into question how he attained these abilities. Where is that writing you guys are credited for?Even more embarrassing is that director Steve Miner, who directed Part II didn't see a need to do anything differently either. The other two factors that do not work are its cinematography and the point of being a horror film. The cinematography provided by Gerald Feil is just another repetition of prior DPs' work to the last two films. There are lots of POV shots, perhaps too many. The way Feil tried to get 3D shots was somewhat okay but also looked forced too. Lastly, the film just isn't scary anymore. There were so many false jump scares and the amount of times somebody asked who's there? became more obnoxious than creepy. There are only a few areas that work to this film's credit. The biggest note is the same for every viewer - we all learn where Jason got his mask. Since that is the thing everyone associates him with, that is important.Of all the protagonists, Dana Kimmel as the main lead is again the only character to really stand out. This reason stands alone because she has a connection (although weak) with Jason. Another good aspect are the kills which run between already used but also new. Like previous films, the kills are gruesome and would surely hurt if it happened to you. However, just the fact that it's Jason as a massive force the impact of each murder feels that much stronger. This doesn't let him get away with the mistakes in continuity. The final aspect to the movie that continues to work in its favor as best as it can be is composer Harry Manfredini's score. For the most of the composition, Manfredini keeps the tone and atmosphere the same with minor alterations. The biggest difference is in the main title which substitute strings for synth keyboard. This is the only subtle change though. It's not adding any layers of thoughtful writing to its ongoing series of entries and this is where it begins to not make any sense. The writers completely ignored Jason's backstory and hardly develop its main cast. Instead, a flimsy coincidence is thrown in just to have a reason for Jason to appear.

Cut six minutes out of that for recap (because this is a series that has a story so involving, you need a recap, let alone a recap longer than one given the season finale of an involved TV series) leaving us with 89 minutes. Cut about three minutes of that for the end credits. 86. Then cut the ten minute opening sequence of two shop owners who are killed by Jason and have nothing to do with the movie. So this is 76 minutes. Then you can cut any variety of bits and pieces out and you're left with a very bare bones film.A bunch of random teens get together to go to camp and get systematically murdered by Jason. The back of the box likes to tell me they are all camp counselors, the victims of Jason's attacks, but nowhere in the movie does it say. It seems that the revenge killing that was the driving force of the previous films has been replaced with killing for the heck of it.Despite the fact the plot is paper thin, the characters stale stereotypes (a jock, a loser, eighties bikers, potheads), and the movie is so padded out you could skip half of it, it still improves the series in a few ways. First of all, gone is the The cameraman's gonna kill you directing of the other two. I prefer to see the killer doing his stuff and rather than keep the killer behind the camera, we see him, making it a lot more exciting. Also, the gore is much better with a couple of ultra-ridiculous deaths rather than the boring ones of the previous two films.That said, the formula is getting stale. The ending of the woman surviving and going insane has gotten extremely boring. They could at least try to do a different ending. Instead, we're given a padded piece of crap that is, once again, a terrible movie overall but so bad it's good. Easy to riff, hard to take seriously.

With Part 2's competent director Steve Miner returning to offer more effective frights and gore, whilst taking every opportunity to thrust assorted objects, weapons, and body parts right into the audience's lap, the result was a fun entry that starts off as a semi-comic piece of silliness packed with stereotypical characters and genre clichés, but ultimately ends up in full-on scary horror mode.After a brief recap of events from the second film, Part 3 starts proper as a group of teenage friends set off for a break at a cabin located near Crystal Lake, the scene of not one, but two horrific massacres! This fact doesn't seem to bother the kids, who proceed to make out, play pranks, smoke dope, and generally behave in a manner guaranteed to make them ideal victim material for legendary deformed killer Jason Vorhees (Richard Brooker).As in the previous two films, the number of teens is gradually whittled down until only one girl remains to fight back Chris (Dana Kimmell), the pretty survivor of an attack by Jason several years earlier.Although this entry in the series is less serious in tone than the previous films, offering very cheesy dialogue, dumb plot development, and some silly death scenes, it is still a very enjoyable film there's plenty of killings, a fair bit of gore (although some of the deaths were trimmed in order to avoid an 'X' rating), a shower scene featuring a hot 80s chick, and several effective jump scares. Oh, and let's not forget that this film is also the one where Jason first dons his hockey mask!Even when watched without the benefit of the added third dimension, the film is a total hoot, with the moments designed to make the most of the 3-D technology often resulting in hilarity rather than horror gratuitous 'in your face' shots include a yo-yo going up and down, a snake lunging at the camera, falling books, popcorn popping up in the air, a harpoon flying towards a victim, a pitchfork handle poking at the viewer, and best of all, an eyeball shooting from a crushed head.

The murders are robotic, and there is no real compassion or feeling to be generated toward any - ANY - of the characters.

Part 3 is no exception--after a somewhat spooky opening, it devolves into a pointless, poorly-acted, and awfully dull slasher flick, with makeup effects that are rough and often laughable (be sure to hold back your chuckles during the 'unmasking' scene).  Even more laughable is the fact that TWO writers are credited for this rubbish, one of which I'm determined just picked out stuff to be thrust at the screen for the 3D process.  The lead actress is one of the dumbest heroines I've had the displeasure to put up with since watching Bloody Moon.

Isn't that the most inspired horror idea you've ever heard ?  Pardon my sarcasm...I shouldn't be too harsh when reviewing a Friday the 13th sequel. Obviously because this entire series never intended to win any important awards. Friday the 13th is a money-making franchise and, as long as the story contains a few nasty and inventive killings, the audience is happy. So why should I be any different. I enjoyed ALL Fridays up till a certain level and I even think this third installment is a huge improvement over the second one. I might even say it slightly surpasses the original.Part 3 was directed by the same person who brought us episode 2. Steve Miner obviously learnt a few techniques in the time between his two efforts. I watched Friday the 13th part 2 only a couple of weeks ago and I already don't remember anything about it. I just know it was slow and boring with no killings worth remembering. And that's in fact the only thing that counts when making a slasher !! Memorable killings ! In that point of view, Friday the 13th part 3 is far more superior. Jason becomes a bit more creative when he's wasting the lives of his young victims and ... even more importantly... he develops his personality and own style that he'll continue to use for the rest of career. In this movie, he becomes the slow moving brute with the typical hockey-mask. Let's just say he got that mask as a gift from one of his preys. Furthermore, there's not much more to tell. Except for a few weird details. Crazy Ralph from the first two movies is being replaced by an even bigger weirdo, although his appearance is rather short. It also seems like Jason once left a survivor behind ( this sequence is explained through a flashback )...that was hard  to believe for me. And - last but not least -  even though this movie was shot in the early 80's, one of the leading characters is an authentic hippie !! Friday the 13th part 3 ranks pretty high when all the separate episodes are compared with each other, in my opinion. Plus, I think it's a pretty important movie for the series. Along with episode 6 ( which remains my personal favorite ) this movie was responsible for making Jason Vorhees the immense horror icon that he is. A must for the fans.

She eliminates a group of teenagers who have come to reopen the camp, but in the end she dies. Then in the second chapter her son comes back as a grownup (masked) man taking revenge for his mother. (In my view since sequels II-III-IV occurs on same continuing periods, they can closely consider as F13th SECOND PART TRILOGIES!).This sequel starts from where the previous film left off, continuing from same day of the last movie, Jason wakes up from the machete stabbing then walks towards for the next mission. With a body count of 12 and some chilling 3D promoting camera works with very excellent unexpected scary moments, this sequel features a different tone on Friday franchise.Scripted by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson, did their best for extending Jason's image as a horror icon. The killings, the camera pans, and the situations they wrote for the screen were good but the problem comes from the story narration. There are lots of boring moments, stupid dialogues, and silly cheap suspense we have to go through for getting some thrilling scenes. Or did they aped those 80's usual suspense tricks.Soul of the movie is provided by Harry Manfredini, in this chapter he done a nice job for creating tensions especially in those chasing scenes. Editing by George Hively was not good but O.K when it comes to 3D setting views.And as for the second chance of Jason, the man behind the mask, Richard Brooker did a great tremendous work. His effort to play Jason by keeping that character as the same maniac, but adding an unexpected scary element was just outstanding. Having an historical importance, in this movie Jason first time wore the now-familiar hockey mask.Richard Brooker was the first one to appear in the most appreciated outfit of Jason.

I wish I could have seen it in that version, because it would probably have made it a lot more interesting. I imagine the makers decided to add that little bit of cinematic trickery to create another surge of interest in the series, which really hasn't done anything new by the time the second sequel came out to add on to the original idea. I've been going back and re-watching all the old classics, I'm working on the Nightmare on Elm Streets and the Friday the 13th films right now, and in comparison it's amazing how much more callous and brutal the Friday the 13th films are, while the Nightmare on Elm Street films, while equally campy, I tend to find much more entertaining and well-made (not that that's saying much.).Watch, for example, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, and then watch just about any Friday the 13th movie, and you can see what I mean right away. The Elm Street films are peppered with low-brow and goofy (although quite often effective, even when it's not really meant to be funny) comic relief, butthe Friday the 13th films (especially part 3, I've noticed so far) are little more than strings of scenes of teenagers doing teenage things at Camp Crystal Lake and getting brutally murdered by the relentless Jason Voorhees.Friday the 13th Part 3 concerns yet another crowd of idiot teens who go out to Camp Crystal Lake, bypass yet another ominous warning from a crazy old man along the way, and proceed to engage in a lot of the exact same antics that we saw in the first two movies. There's the addition here of a hopelessly geeky kid with them who have an annoying habit of faking his own bloody death in order to scare all the girls (after which he wonders why none of them like him), but at least providing the only bit of mystery in the entire film. As I watched the movie, my roommates and I were betting on whether he would get killed, then someone wouldn't believe him and then get killed themselves, or if someone else would get killed, he would think they were trying to get revenge for his bad jokes, and then he would get killed for real. Kind of sad when the only thing that it really interesting in a movie like this is in what order the teens will get killed.That strikes me as a definite sign that the movies are starting to lose their thrill (either because of the 20 years between the film's release and now or because each sequel really does nothing new). I wonder if the 3D element really did add that extra needed bit of excitement. One thing that was really funny was the motorcycle gang. These people were awesome. Seriously. On their way to the Lake, the kids stop at a store to get some junk food essentials, and are confronted by what I assume was supposed to be a hardened gang of bikers. These people were HILARIOUS. After harassing the kids in the store, the geeky kid accidentally backs the VW Bug into their motorcycles, knocking them over. The lead biker responds by calmly walking up to the car, smiling brightly at him, and then smashing the windshield and the driver's side window. Angered beyond ability to just leave, the kid decides to circle around and run over the bikes head-on, which he succeeds in doing because the aforementioned biker couldn't KICKSTART his motorcycle in time. Maybe had the poor biker realized that street bikes don't kickstart but are started with a key and an ignition button, he would have been able to save his pimp ride. He and his friends might even have avoided their fate as pointless fodder for Jason to slice and dice later in the movie. Ah well.So there was certainly no shortage of comic relief, and I really don't think it matters that the comedy in these movies wasn't originally meant to be comedy. At least they're still entertaining. The thing that really drags the movie down is that it is literally nothing more than a flimsy clothesline of a plot that is punctuated by gruesome killings of idiot teenagers. There's only so many movies that you can make about a lot of kids who decide to do something dangerous by going out to the haunted lake to taunt the legend of Jason Voorhees and then not realize that he's really there killing them all one by one until only one is left, and even then she hits him with a shovel or stabs him in the thigh and then starts clawing at locked doors, not thinking to maybe make a little more certain that Jason's not going to get back up. You would think that at least ONE of these last victims would realize that the best time to get the best of Jason is when he's lying unconscious at her feet. But no.The second sequel of the Friday the 13th saga is little more than a rehash of the old Camp Crystal Lake legend, and given the proliferation of sequels that followed, hopefully something new comes up later. Given the final scene, I would really like to see a character in a later movie throw out some jokes about Jason's mom. Can you imagine? How cool would it be to see some bonehead teenager laughing his head off around the campfire or something as all of his friends look at him in horror because Jason is approaching him from behind with a gigantic butcher knife as the kid says, `Hey Jason, yo momma's so ugly, she won't even come out of the lake!

Well I like Jason as a film character, he's probably my favourite horror killer, the character's are slightly better than usual with OK back-stories, it moves along at a nice pace, there's a decent body-count & the murders are pretty cool although it's a shame they had to suffer at the hands, or should that be scissors, of the censors... There isn't really much else to say other than if your looking for a slasher film that ticks all the right boxes as far as the slasher sub genre goes then you could do a lot worse than Friday the 13th Part III that's for sure. This is also the first time that Jason wears the now infamous hockey mask although he takes until about halfway through he film to do so.Director Miner does OK although the big point of interest as far as Friday the 13th part III goes is that it was originally shot in 3D & it is to date the only Friday the 13th film to be shot in the full 2.351 aspect widescreen ratio, so make sure you pick up that DVD version of it! Obviously the 3D effect is lost when viewed today although I thought it was quite fun to spot all the scenes where the 3D gimmick would have been used, from washing line posts shoved into the audiences face to juggling fruit, from a yo-yo to a chained fist shooting out of the screen & then there's the kills which use it as well like when Jason shoots a harpoon into someones eye, when he sticks a pitchfork trough someones throat & a strange bit when he crushes someones head & their eyeball pops out! While the kills have obviously been trimmed there's still some decent gore, someone is cut in half with a machete, someone is impaled on a hot poker, there's a slashed throat, someone has a meat clever stuck in their chest, there's knitting needles in the back of peoples heads, there's a knife stuck through a girls back which ends up coming out of her breast & someone has their hand cut off.With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 Friday the 13th Part III is well made & is certainly a lot better than most of the straight-to-video horror film crap that's been released lately. A special mention goes to the absolutely awful opening & closing credits theme music which is hideously bad! Thankfully the music used during the film itself is more fitting. The acting was alright, the girls are suitably good looking & that's what counts in films like this.Friday the 13th Part III is admittedly just another slasher in a limited & overcrowded sub genre but the Friday the 13th series is my favourite horror film franchise & I actually like all of them, anyway it's not for everyone but Friday the 13th fans like myself will lap it up. If your a slasher/horror fan the this is a must, anyone else would probably find little here to impress.

The plot is all over the place and it is poorly written there basically isn't even a plot its just people getting killed i don't know what paramount were thinking when they decided to make this film. when i was watching it i was in hysterics because it was so funny to watch the crappy reactions on the actors faces. If you want a good laugh then this is the film for you because this is the most rubbish piece of crap i have ever saw. i don't recommend you renting this out its only good for watching when there is nothing else on "},{"Title":"Sequels , Sequels , Sequels , That`s All You Guys Think About","Date":"15 June 2003","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Why on earth did film makers in the early 80s decide to make films in 3D ? It`s a worthless gimmick that died out in the 1950s when cinema audiences realised they looked completely stupid wearing the sort of specs Larry Fishburne later wore in DEATH WISH 2 . On top of that 3D films are always badly directed in an unnatural manner with objects poking through the screen. FRIDAY THE I3TH 3D gimmick isn`t as intrusive as JAWS 3 but that doesn`t stop it from being a poor movie . Strangely its failures aren`t down to the 3D but down to its script which involves nothing we haven`t seen before . A bunch of teenagers get stalked by an axe wielding madman , gee now where did I see that plot ? To be fair to the screenwriter he does change the formula slightly by adding a couple of hash heads and a trio of multi ethnic bikers to the list of potential victims but this is the third film in a franchise that didn`t need any sequels .Note to directors  If you`re going to direct a movie in 3D with a woman in a shower can you ensure she`s filmed from the waist up facing the camera otherwise it`s a waste of time filming in 3D  "},{"Title":"Decent","Date":"13 March 2008","Score":"0 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Friday the 13th Part 3 (1982) ** (out of 4)Friday the 13th 3 is best remembered for being in 3-D and this too hampers the film when watching it normally. Various scenes look so incredibly stupid on television because objects are simply walking towards the camera for no apparent reasons. Of course this was done for the 3-D effects but since we can't view the film that way then we haven't much use for it.This film here will always remain famous for being the part where Jason gets his hockey mask but outside that it really doesn't offer anything too enjoyable. I'm really not sure what it is about the film but director Steve Minor seems to be sleepwalking through every scene because nothing interesting really happens. We get the typical teenagers and the typical murders but everything because the murders and naked girls is just pure boredom, which I believe is due to the leading lady.Dane Kimmell was certainly a drop down from King and Steel and she offers nothing to the role and makes the film all the more boring. The supporting victims aren't too interesting either so we've got nothing fun added outside the murders, which once again are quite good including one scene where a man is split in half. Director Miner also seems to be going for more humor since one of the characters is an actor and we also get a quite humorous scene inside a grocery store where a motorcycle gang gets involved.**The below is for the 3-D version of the film. Mild spoilers as I talk about various killings.**** 1/2 (out of 4)Only God knows how many times I had watched this film in 2-D but this here was my first chance at viewing it in the original 3-D format. It's no secret that I've never been a fan of this movie and sadly it's only marginally improved with the added gimmick. If you haven't seen the film then minor spoilers are going to follow so that I can judge the 3-D effects. For the most part I thought the recent Paramount DVD was pretty good in terms of the effect but I've read it's going to depend on your television size. For the most part I thought the effects worked quite well even though there are a few that were poorly done. Both the snake and rat sequences from the grocery store didn't look too good in 3-D. The scene where the biker punches through the glass also looked rather weak. I think the gimmick worked the best when people were holding objects and pointing them towards the camera. One good example happens at the grocery store when the guy lifts the pole up and points it to the camera. His death sequence is also pretty good. Another great sequence is when arrow through the eye happens as you can certainly feel this one if you know what I mean. The infamous eye coming out didn't work as well as I had hoped but it still looks okay. These added 3-D moments improved the film slightly but I still consider this a weaker on in the series. It's obvious that everyone was worried about the gimmick that they forgot to write very good characters. I think most of them are quite forgettable and that includes the lead who was certainly a step down from the previous two films.

At least, we get a couple of inventive deaths (accentuated by 3-D) the harpoon through the eye and the squashed head - the latter leading to a hilarious moment as an eye spurts out at the camera! The first fifteen minutes of the film are actually wasted on yet another reprise of the climax from the previous entry - followed by an endless and irrelevant murder set-piece! This film also answered a question I had put up in my review of its predecessor, in connection with Jason's mask. Despite my obvious Iack of enthusiasm for this type of film, I went ahead and rented the next two installments in the Friday saga - and should be gradually rounding off the whole series by Halloween. Yawn... "}]
