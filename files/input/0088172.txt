His gentle alien comes in the form of a human clone (Jeff Bridges), and as we watch him interact with the rest of our race, we see both the good and the bad in all of us.  It is this particular role that I find to be Jeff Bridge's most superb acting (or close to it, given his amazing work in 'The Fisher King').  To me he always did seem an alien in an unfamiliar human body, rather than the actor Jeff Bridges.  While there is certainly some over-simplification in the movie, and it can get a little sappy, I find the 'sap' in this case to be both touching and beautiful.  How wonderful, how sad, how miraculous, to watch ourselves through the innocent and wise eyes of this alien being.  A brilliant look at human beings, a sweet love story, and an excellent exploration of our spirit.

This film is about love.  An alien lands on Earth to investigate the life-forms, and encounters Karen Allen.  A cross-country chase ensues as our alien has to meet up with his starship in Arizona. But for me, the main point of this film is not the chase, the cloning by the alien, the humor throughout the film, or the eventual outcome which led into the subsequent TV series.  The focal point comes in the diner where our alien asks Karen Allen to Define Love.  If everyone would take this definition to heart, this world would be a much better place!This is what movie making should strive to achieve.  This film has virtually everything...  romance, humor, action, suspense, a gorgeous soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, an intelligent screenplay with a most important message, and talented actors and actresses.

He has been acting for thirty-five years and only been nominated four times. Starman (1984) gave him his third nomination and while he had tough competition that year, F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce in Amadeus, his performance is brilliant and every bit as good. The way that Bridges takes the character and the little glitches in his movement and speech are fascinating. It is a complete transformation and it's flawless. I was reminded of how Dustin Hoffman played his character in Rain Man with all his little stutters and twitching, but Hoffman studied the disease and had something to work with. Bridges pulls this performance off from scratch and hits a bullseye. Karen Allen and Charles Martin Smith are both good as well and the score is wonderful. The story may be a bit derivative and there are some story lulls, but who cares. This is a must-see movie simply for Bridges performance.*** out of **** "},{"Title":"E.T. for adults","Date":"5 June 2003","Score":"49 out of 65 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" I'm amazed more people didn't point out the similarities in plot to E.T. when this adult version of basically the same tale came out. Maybe it was because Jeff Bridges performance is absolutely mesmerising, that you're much more interested in the characters than the plot, so you don't notice.Basically, a perfect little movie. Beautifully and simply set up, the characters develop naturally in such a way that keeps you hooked right through to the end of the film. The strength of the central relationship distracts you from little infelicities, such as the fact that Jennyhayden seems remarkably incurious about her alien visitor - even after she gets to know him, it's not until he's about to leave that she asks him what his world is like! The film nicely points out the irony of our having extended welcoming greetings to the Universe, while our own mutual distrust causes us to shoot down every unexpected flying visitor. Having established that, however, Richard Jaekel's character seems to be pursuing the violent solution for its own sake without really exploring any motivation. When Charles Martin Smith points out that our behaviour does appear a little rude, Jaekel doesn't even have an answer for him - he's just going to try to kill the alien because that's his role in the movie I guess! Do you know what I find most beautiful about you? You are at your best when things are at their worst.Well, it has been 19 years - I guess that the boy baby has grown up.

Starman was a significant departure and change-of-pace from all of Carpenter's earlier works.While essentially a science fiction story involving all the essentials - aliens, the United States Army, government cover-ups, a countrywide chase adventure and what's this, an intergalactic love story? - Carpenter is able to make sense of the material in such a way that it is both respectful to the sci-fi genre, the sci-fi fans, and to the audience members who may not give a crap about this sort of stuff and only want their corn popped.The biggest surprise about Starman is the script by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon. They're able to strip a laughable story of all that makes it laughable and create something new, something that is intelligent, heart-warming, action-packed, and romantic. Carpenter takes his cues from the material and makes everything in this wondrous sci-fi/action piece his own. And who can forget that awesome synthesizer score by Jack Nitzsche (strange since Carpenter usually composes his own film scores)?Evans and Gideon's script, taking its cues from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and E.T. the Extraterrestrial (1982), concerns an alien who has come to Earth after answering an invitation he found on the Voyager II space probe. However, his ship is attacked by fighter jets and he manages to make it to the Wisconsin cabin of young widow Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen), still grieving the death of her husband. After sampling DNA taken from a lock of hair of her late husband, the alien grows into a human clone of him, where he is now played by the actor Jeff Bridges.After overcoming the obvious speech barrier when he learns to speak in English, Starman then requests that Jenny Hayden drive him from Wisconsin to Arizona, where he will meet the mother ship that will take him back to his home planet. Unfortunately, they only have a few days before he'll die from what we can only guess is exposure to our atmosphere. Matters are further complicated when the military becomes involved, desperate to catch Starman at all costs, much to the horror of laboratory rat Mark Shermin (Charles Martin Smith). Along the way, Jenny grows from being fearful of this visitor from another planet, to respecting him and finally loving him, while he gets to learn about human beings and BEING human.It's not enough to say that both Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen are this film's magical centerpiece. They certainly make for one of the most dynamic, unusual and interesting screen couples in cinematic history, certainly one of the best screen couples in the history of science fiction cinema. The real stand-out of course is Bridges. This is a role that he rightfully received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for. We see no trace of the actor Jeff Bridges in there, all we see is Starman, defined largely by his awkward mannerisms and patterns of speech, and it is a skillful, humorous, and touching performance that is the pure anti-thesis to Carpenter's earlier The Thing (1982).John Carpenter, unfortunately, has not received a whole lot of recognition for this picture. Although it remains his only film to go to the Oscars, I only hope that this touching, once-in-a-lifetime science fiction/adventure-romance gets the recognition it so rightfully deserves.10/10 "},{"Title":"Great Allegory","Date":"9 August 2004","Score":"43 out of 55 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Reading all the comments on this film, I had to add my own. Unusual thing about the comments is that none were heavily negative. Good film in my opinion too. But only one viewer comment mentioned something that jumped out as I watched, and that is the heavy, but very heavy religious overtones in the film. A creature from the heavens comes to earth, assumes human form, has nothing but good intentions toward those who would capture him, has the power of life and death in his hands (the resurrection of the deer and Karen Allen), has to ascend to the heavens in 3 days, gives a boy baby to Jenny (who can't have a child) in a cattle car (manger) who will be a teacher and know all that I know. They even point out a star in the heavens that is the home of Starman. The allegory is strong and delightful to watch. Of course the ending is a perfect set-up for a sequel when Starman leaves the one remaining power ball in Jenny's hand saying that the boy would know what to do with it. With one exception, no movie I have ever seen with a Roman numeral after it was worth a bag of beans, and that was Godfather II. Starman does not need a sequel.

A strong story, that succeeds in avoiding all the predictable jokes about a stranger getting to know the customs of a new environment (like e.g. Crocodile Dundee, or Blast from the Past), good actors, strong directing and great special effects (Bridges' transformation from a baby to an adult!) that never predominate the rest of the story.  It's hard to believe this movie is already 18 years old!

In `Starman,' directed by John Carpenter, Jeff Bridges stars as the alien who responds, only to be met with a less than cordial greeting once he arrives.  Encountering hosts with a militaristic, if-you-can't-identify-it-shoot-it-down attitude, Starman is forced to take refuge and elude the very ones he has traveled so far to see.  The burning question of course is, why?  And, unfortunately, nobody seems to know. 	For his striking portrayal of Starman, Bridges deservedly received a Best Actor nomination from the Academy, and it proves to be the highlight of the film.  From the outset, even as he is transformed into the vessel he must occupy during his stay with us ( a terrific sequence), his presence on the screen is captivating.  He truly creates a unique character, distinct in form and substance, from the physical gestures that define him, to the subtle emotional depth he so aptly demonstrates and uses so well to convey to us who this being really is.  It is through him that we are drawn in to this story of the travails with which he is beset during his sojourn upon our world, and with him we can only try to understand the motivation of powerful men who seem to live their lives in fear of the unknown or diverse. 	As Jenny Hayden, the young woman who through circumstances beyond her control becomes involved with Starman, Karen Allen adds just the right touch of sympathy to underscore the emotional situation in which Jenny finds herself ensconced.  And there's just enough chemistry between her and Bridges to make this special relationship between their characters work effectively.  Ultimately, how they relate to one another, and the tenderness with which they pursue their objective, becomes the real thrust and focal point of the story.  Carpenter, in fact, would have been well advised to have stayed more within the parameters of that relationship and explored the workings thereof, rather than divesting the story into other, less fruitful areas and surrounding the main characters with a plethora of stringent stereotypes.    While an entertaining film, `Starman' is surprisingly lacking in originality and imagination, both in story and direction; not to say this isn't a worthwhile endeavor, because it is, and it's definitely worth seeing.  But it just seems that Carpenter could have mined the emotional depths a little more, developed the connection between Starman and Jenny more fully.  Had he taken that path, this could have been a truly exceptional movie.  As it is, it's a good film, better than the average sci-fi offering (especially for it's time, 1984), but given that Bridges brought so much to this with his creation of such a memorable character, the movie as a whole could have been so much more. 	The supporting cast includes Charles Martin Smith (Mark), Richard Jaeckel (Fox), Robert Phalen (Major Bell), Dirk Blocker (Cop #1) and M.C. Gainey (Cop #2).  Although it is not what you would call a `great' or `classic' movie, `Starman' does succeed in making us take pause to reconsider some of our possibly preconceived notions of the way things are or should be; in the end, it's a call for understanding and love between all people everywhere, and a proposition put forth for universal peace.  And with a theme like that, combined with the terrific performance by Bridges, you could do a lot worse for an evenings entertainment.  I rate this one 7/10.

I tell you this, for perhaps there may be a tad of latent hostility that has generalized from her to the movie. First, he is 100,000 years ahead of us and this is his functionality in our primitive culture? Look, the hen head movements get old really quickly and his whole depiction of such an advanced culture is utterly silly and poorly written. As a misanthropist, I can assure you when things are worst we are not at our best; wait till the power grid goes down you will see THE ROAD and not STARMAN. The main problem with the film besides its complete lack of verisimilitude is its need to milk the audience shamelessly for tears. One gooey scene after another with the requisite he loves all creatures great and small. Sorry, young people once you age, trust me the film loses its luster. Go out into the world; things will change your adoration of people.Bridges gives quite an overrated, unbelievable performance not close to being Oscar worthy. His actions do not bespeak an advanced culture; he, frankly, behaves like a sentimental, retarded person. It just never works. Their romance is so hurried and utterly silly. Tell me how to say goodbye? Tell me how to barf in the bag? Tell me how to flush the toilet? Does this seem like an alien 100,000 years ahead of us? The same evil government crap, we got in E.T., the monolithic army of faceless villains. Most of you are too young to remember that this came out one year after E.T. and you do not see it as we did then. John Carpenter's attempt to hurry and cash in on E.T. This was marketed as an adult version of E.T.Trust me, an alien that far ahead of us would not be remotely this helpless. We would be the helpless ones. I do not care for the new DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL but its depiction of what we would be to them is excellent. Klatu smiles at Bates when she tells him they will have to hold him; like give it a try ape woman. How did that go? Remember when the helicopters try to kill him, he turns their laser beams as guides for his energy and blows them up with a look of how pathetic their weapons are, you poor monkey boys. I understand that Carpenter has to draw him this way for the romantic needs of the movie; this is the core of why the film is so bad. It is a romance with science fiction in the background and the reality of the alien is sacrificed to make the romance work. An alien like that would be as afraid of us as much as we are of a squirrel. Please, and the stupidity of his trying to be human as if it is such a conundrum; please the self aggrandizement of humans kissing their own collective butts is quite nauseating. Go to Auschwitz then tell me how noble we are how about Pol Pot and the killing fields. Look if you are going to J off try not to make us all watch? Those of us who know our history. I gave one star for Jaekal and Martin Smith who are great actors; their scenes together are one of the only reasons to endure this gooey, silly, utterly stupid piece of crap.

Back in '84, I guess E.T. fever was still running high and a similarly told tale that was nothing more than competent was enough to rekindle the memories. Watching it in 2006 for the first time as I did today, I personally expected a lot more from a Carpenter favourite.As mentioned, he does well enough in the directors chair, but the script doesn't have his name on it, and it shows. Our Starman seems to have powers that are written as flexible according to what's happening with the plot at the time, which is hardly awe-inspiring if you've got the scope to craft an otherworldly being. He can learn to drive a car just by watching us, and yet he can NEVER get around to becoming a decent mimic of our speech patterns??? (Studio talking funny is endearing to the audience, keep it in!!!!!) Bridges does what the role asks of him (and got an Oscar nomination for it) but any admirer who's seen a representative sample of his work knows that behaving quizzically with a halting voice and beguiling charm is not exactly testing for him, he is capable of so much more. Karen Allen is a wonderfully pretty and talented actress but she didn't manage to 'sell' me the burgeoning romance between her and her co-star, here. So far as I could surmise, the character is seduced by an alien because he LOOKS the same as her dead hubby... So, 'personality' isn't important, then?? The entire romance is like trite manipulation, and it's even worse when the script attempts to describe love, because the sentiment is pretty accurate, but the practical demonstration of chemistry before our eyes isn't.Moving away from the main characters, all that's left is the big bad military bogeymen of the Cold-War era getting involved. Yeah yeah, it was a recurring theme throughout the 80's, it's nothing fresh. In fact, I can't think of a single scene that felt specific to this one particular film I was watching, it all felt somewhat stale; so either it's been ripped off too much in the intervening years by its multitude of descendants, or else it wasn't all that 'inventive' in the first place. If you saw it when you were a kid, it also might be a personal favourite, but I don't think it's made the transition well into an adult sphere. If you're in the mood for some Close-style Encounters and you've overdosed on watching the Extra-Terrestrial, you might find this adequate to stoke your obsession as a stopgap; just don't expect a cosmic experience or you'll come crashing down to earth, because this really is a touch mundane.

He was very believable as an alien in an unfamiliar body, with all the nuances of body language finely honed to convince us in almost subliminal fashion. The ultimate fish out of water. There were a few incongruities, though -- such as despite a lack of precise physical control of his new body, he nevertheless manages some nifty moves with that handgun!Karen Allen was perfect as the bereaved widow, Jenny Hayden. And beautiful, as always, in her wide-eyed vulnerability. Her performance was the equal of Bridges', with the subtle development of her character's relationship with the starman from puzzlement to terror to trust to understanding to love. The only problem I have here is that sometimes her (Hayden's) deep understanding of the human psyche (Define love.) seems a bit out of character, although she (Allen) tries to compensate by delivering these lines in halting fashion.But that's Hollywood! If the movie was true-to-life realistic, it would be too dull for words!I admire Carpenter's restraint in avoiding the typical schlock humor typical of the fish out of water genre. The story wisely focuses on the character development of the two principals. I was a bit disturbed, however, by the overly bloodthirsty, shoot first, ask afterwards, bent of the Fox character as representing U.S. policy. But the shootdown and pursuit were a necessity to make the story work.The Nitzsche score was perfect unobtrusive, yet supportive, and with a bit of an other-worldly undertone -- rather like the whole production.This is a finely crafted film.

He lands in her backyard in Wisconsin when his ship plunges to earth. Little communication between them, but he makes Allen drive him across the country in her '77 Mustang with a working knowledge of English consisting of a few phrases here and there. His mission is to reach Arizona within a few days to meet his starship or it leaves without him and he dies.The fantasy aspect remains credible until about midpoint in the story when the alien exhibits some supernatural powers. Even a sci-fi romance of this kind shouldn't become too incredible. The romantic angle is restrained and nicely underplayed, especially by Bridges who gets his idea of kissing from watching a clip from FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.The second half of the story deals more with the police on their tail trying to rescue Allen, who by now has fallen in love with her kidnapper and doesn't want them to harm him. It's also at this point that the story loses steam and interest in the denouement lessens instead of increases--obviously the opposite of what Carpenter intended--nor does the climactic scene with Bridges joining his space ship have the punch it should have had. (Maybe it needed John Williams for that added dimension!)The film depends largely on JEFF BRIDGES' performance as the alien. He does it with strange gestures and head jerks but is always convincingly like an inhuman mannequin. Even his walk is stiff.Favorite line from driver who gives Bridges a lift You're not from around here, are yah? Summing up Offbeat and interesting, but could have had a deeper impact.

Starman is not only one of the best movies of the 1980's but it holds its own against any other classic movie from the corridoors of Time in Movieland.Iam not as such a fan of John Carpenter, but i will admit that he has a talent, and with talent must come the ability to control this. With Starman he does just that. He avoids any moves of vanity on his own behalf, wich he so often fell into in the past, and finds a style that is moving warm and even beautiful. It is worthy of note that this is a rare example of Carpenter having no involvement in the producing, Writing or Musical duties, so what he brings to the table is perhaps what the script might of been missing, and what makes Starman The Movie so great. At the core ofthe movie is the excellent overall story and well developed characters presented to us by the writers Bruce A Evans and Raynold Gideon. This is well in tune with the leisurely and even Alien direction from Caprenter wich moves at such a heavenly place its like picturesque music without sound. Carpenter does express his shock tactics and trick photography he employed on classics like Halloween, The Fog and The Thing, and even though Starman isn't a horror movie, these tactics seem more suitable to this Sci-Fi/Romance.The two vital components in making Starman work are Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen. As Starman Bridges is so convincing in an almost retarded role that when you see the images of the life the Alien has assumed, Scot Hayden BridgesIt is easy to believe that these are two different actors. Bridges gets to grips with the Alien he is playing but plays it so gentle and mesmeric that when the love affair between Starman and Jenny Hayden Karen Allen blossoms, you are at once cheering it on. Karen Allen is the real revelation to the film, she is us watching Starman's progression through his human life, and is just as amazed and in awe of what she see's as we are. Bridges and Allen make a very believable screen couple as both Scot and Jenny Hayden and Starman and Jenny Hayden, and it is beautiful to watch them on screen together.The one slightly disapointing aspect of the movie is that it falls into a conventional and predictable trap of Romance movies at it's Climax when Starman has to leave. O.K., so this is the whole point of the movie's kinetics, but it seems to resemble too much, Spielbergs E.T. The Extra Terestrial. This is not to compare it too much to that film, because a piece of Starman stays behind in this movie See for yourself, and i might annoy some people by saying that Starman is more profesionally and gracefully made than Spielbergs 1982 classic.All the elemnts work,from the special effects, to the make up and costume, and even the point of the movie being a road film, because you are so engaged by the developement between the Starman and Jenny Hayden Characters. And other than that minor quibble, I can't find anything else to fault with this movie. It is well made and acted, boast a fine Jack Nitzche musical score and is beautifully photographed by Donald M Morgan.A Highly Recommended winner........................................................................ 10/10 "},{"Title":"Great John Carpenter film!","Date":"20 May 2003","Score":"8 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":"  John Carpenter's Starman is a wonderful film!Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen are really good in this movie!The beginning is scary and the film is never boring and its very in interesting and yet sad and the same moment.It has great effects and a good ending!If you like alien films then check Starman today because it is a fantastic movie!

The only time a Carpenter movie got an Oscar nod. Karen Allen is also quite good. She and Bridges have a nice chemistry together. The often underrated Charles Martin Smith is another plus. It's an enjoyable film but probably more so for your average moviegoer than critical sci-fi buffs. I like it a lot and don't feel like it gets enough love from other Carpenter fans.

It's a lovely film headed up by Jeff Bridges' wonderful turn as the alien from outer space teaming up with Karen Allen for a road trip to a Nevada crater, where he will be picked up by his own species and taken home.Taking on human form, that of Allen's deceased husband, much of the humour is derived from how the alien tries to adapt to a human lifestyle. The language, food, customs and romance, but always there is a serious thread running through the narrative. He was invited here by the contents of Voyager One, but now the suits want him for less than honourable research, so the pair, coming together as one after she is obviously in a state of kidnap worry, have to stay one step ahead of the authorities.So there's suspense in the mix via the chase dynamics, as well as some beautiful sequences, one of which has animal lovers of the world punch the air with unbridled joy. The premise is of course flimsy, and cribbing bits from ET and Close Encounters did the film no favours under critical analysis, but the emotional whack is mightily strong, with the lead characters being so easy to root for. While Jack Nitzsche's synth based musical score is a sci-fi great, perfect.A vastly under valued picture on Carpenter's CV, Starman would like to come and see us, if only we would give it the time. 8.5/10 "},{"Title":"Mixes romance and science fiction exceedingly well","Date":"25 March 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" I don't know if it's cynical to describe Starman as E.T. for grownups, adults, or what-have-you, but the comparison's certainly there.

But Starman is definitely about healing, either literally with Jeff Bridges and his mystical marbles or helping Karen Allen to grieve her husband's death and start feeling again. Both actors are something to see here. Bridges transforms himself into an innocent, almost mechanized presence as Starman learns the cultures and barbarism of humans.

The movie Starman puts this fact to use when an alien spacecraft obtains this communication, crash lands in the Midwestern lands of Missouri and assumes the identity of a widow's late husband. While their first encounters are that of discomfort, fear, and plain awkwardness, both alien and woman form a friendship and even a romance. The plot sounds almost exactly like E.T., with the replacement of adults and more mature themes. And it essentially is. But what makes this movie so good is not its originality, but rather its interaction with the two main characters.Jeff Bridges as the alien, or rather Starman played the character in such a way that he is foreign like an alien and at the same time something to admire by his depiction of innocence, kindness, and above all his passion and care for living things. There are many great, touching scenes in this movie. One that particularly comes to mind is a moment where he revives a deer that had been slain by a hunter. He deliver such an action because he's a good natured being. Throughout the film, it becomes apparent that the interactions he shares with other humans are generally bad, displaying the darkness and thoughtlessness of the human spirit. In a way, Starman is someone who humans should be when we aren't. Karen Allen as the widow Jenny Hayden delivered perhaps her most complicated role. While it can be easy for an actor to show a variety of emotions that the script may require, it is a challenge to authenticate a person who cannot move on from a lost loved one and carry the bleak and often defeatist personality. In Starman, she gives her finest performance. Though Bridges garnered a lot of credit for his portrayal as Starman, such as a Best Actor Oscar nomination, Allen is an equal caliber. As a viewer, I could feel empathy for her character and desired for her to find the love and compassion she desperately needed to move on with her life. Despite some of its dated VFX and occasionally sappy/overly sentimental moments, Starman is a great film. It is one of the few science-fiction films that does not focus on monsters, robots, blood, explosions, and/or blatant special effects. It's core is in the hearts of the main characters. Jack Nitsche's score is an emotional moving force and John Carpenter's directing capabilities of engrossing viewers into his films is something to remember for the ages.

Perhaps because it is a romantic, rather than a scientific exploration of humanity. Of perhaps because the special effects in the movie were neither revolutionary, nor used very much - the alien looked like Jeff Bridges.I liked it, however. You can see that, even with a script that was not meant to be brilliant, someone took a lot of time to chisel it. It is an above average film in a golden era of movie making and that makes it clearly a good movie now. What I liked most is that the alien is neither excessively cold nor overly excited. He is kind, but not a hippie, maybe a little too naive for an advanced alien being with knowledge of so many other civilizations.Karen Allen was all the rage back then, with her hot cuteness, and Jeff Bridges does a very good job playing the alien. Frankly, he acted more like an AI probe than a member of a specific species, and perhaps this is one of the reasons people failed to resonate with his character; however he really did manage that alien vibe really well.As for the plot, it begins with irony. We send the Voyager probe in space to say hello to other civilizations and when they send something down here, we shoot it down. And it doesn't stop here, as the evil G- men are trying (overly ineptly, in my view) to capture the visitor and immediately dissect it. The alien takes the shape of the recently dead husband of a local woman and she helps him get away.The film is also a strange (and dear to me) depiction of America dusty roads traveled by hard working men and thrill seekers, rebels against their own state, hitchhiking and helping out being a common thing, with road side diners ran by families that cook their own meals. It was the depiction of a world defined by freedom and individuality, if not tolerance. Thirty years later and what an incredible difference.Bottom line I may be partial to late 70s and early 80s movies, but the feel I get from them is unmatched for me. The acting is good, the plot a little shaky, the script well worked out and the directing well done. I think the movie brings little to the table as sci-fi concepts, but the overall feel and mood of the film and the individual details more than make up for that. Plus, as was the custom back then, they leave some room for a sequel. Would the aliens notice the difference 30 years made on humanity?

He could have played the role in very corny fashion, but he felt like somebody that wasn't human. Watching him evolve throughout the film was a delight to watch, and so was his chemistry with Karen Allen. Karen Allen is pretty awesome herself in a more subtle way.

If you can get past that crushing defeat I think you'll like this movie.Don't expect a scifi, an adventure or an action flick of any sort (even though each of those elements figure prominently) because this is a love story. That's what differentiates it from the other films it has been compared to, namely E.T. and The Day the Earth Stood Still. All of these films share the theme of an advanced, benevolent alien visiting the Earth in peace but getting bushwhacked instead, but Starman focuses more on the love story between the alien and the human.In that respect I can only compare it to films like Ghost or Splash or the excellent David Bowie film Man Who Fell to Earth. These are love stories which revisit the old Shakespearean star-crossed lovers theme but with interesting supernatural twists.So with that in mind, watch this movie if you're in the mood for a sentimental ride. Do NOT expect laser guns and spaceships. I gotta hand it to director John Carpenter for pulling this one off, right on the heels of The Thing (1982) which is a dark, claustrophobic tale of terror, about as opposite as you can get to Starman. John Carpenter, known to most people as the master of moody suspense and disturbing horror, shows us a rare side of himself as the sentimentalist (for a third side, the comedian John Carpenter, be sure to check out Big Trouble in Little China).The excellent chemistry between Karen Allen and Jeff Bridges brings it on home.

But would they accept that person back into their life again as a totally different person? This is not an easy question to answer and that's if you had the OPTION. The character of the Starman was just arbitrary. Random. No one told the alien who to be. He just picked what was nearest to him. And although it felt like a curse at first, a miracle occurs and things get much more interesting.The Starman came to Earth for the reason of retrieving a message of greetings in all the languages of the world. So all he was doing was returning the favor and showing the people of Earth that they were not the only ones who were in space. So in order to look like everyone else he takes the form of a human. But which human? Karen Allen plays Jenny Hayden, a widow who lost her husband some time ago and is still grieving over the incident. And who can blame her? Losing a marital partner can be painful; some can't handle it. But she will soon realize that her husband won't be gone for long. For it is the Starman who becomes her new husband.However, problems arise when Hayden finds out that Starman cannot stay on Earth for if he does, he dies. Adding to this is a government agency on their tale looking to find and interrogate Starman; to probe him like a lab rat. Fortunately, not all the members of the agency are out to snag him. Mark Shermin, acted by Charles Martin Smith is man who tries to stick up for Starman and tries to have others realize that they brought him to Earth under peaceful terms; not for scientific experiments. So it is because of these two issues, Jenny and Starman are on the run to get him home before he dies.Playing Starman is Jeff Bridges, basically the same as Jenny's husband but with not with the same personality. At first, Starman is slow to react because he doesn't know he resembles to body of a dead man. The great thing is once Starman is on screen, amazing things start happening immediately! Director John Carpenter is known for having movies with deviant special effects and this is just another one to add to that list. A lot of Starman's personality is almost child-like; innocent. It's what makes him so likable as a character. There are so many examples throughout this film where Starman studies Jenny and watches what she does and then replicates it. It's funny because then Jenny is confused to why he does it!What really makes this a touching story is how well the character development is placed throughout the film. Originally, Jenny Hayden was uninterested and beyond shocked to see that her husband was alive again, only to realize that it wasn't him at all. But by the end of the film, not only will she have a greater understanding about Starman, but Starman will have a true understanding of the people on Earth as well. The music is great too, composed by Jack Nitzsche. The tone of the soundtrack has a nice sci-fi touch with an ambient feel to it.This is a sci-fi drama that not only has great looking special effects but a strong story with well-acted characters. All put together, the cast really pulls in its audience for an experience that's not see often enough.

An alien being (Jeff Bridges) comes to earth, after finding the probe, but his ship goes off course and instead of landing in Arizona, near a famous crater, it goes down in Wisconsin. Nearby is a young widow, Jenny (Karen Allen) who is still grieving over her husband Scott's death. As she sleeps, the alien enters her home, finds a scrapbook of memories of Scott and clones his body from a lock of hair. When Jenny hears noises, she is terrified to discover her the new Scott in her home! The alien has grabbed her gun and explains that he needs her to drive him to Arizona, in order to reconnect with another spaceship from his planet. Still very afraid, Jenny has no choice. But, at first, she tries to alert other travelers that she has been kidnapped. The alien always manages to foil her pleas for help and keep them on the road. Soon, amazingly, Jenny discovers that the Alien means her no harm and the two develop a strong friendship, one universal creature to another. It is just at this moment that the two learn that NASA scientists are on their trail, hoping to kidnap Scott and study him. Jenny knows now that unless he can leave earth, he will die.

The focus really is not so much on the fact that he is alien but rather what is human - both good and bad. Questions about love, courage, honesty, and integrity either directly or more subtly emerge as Bridges, giving a tour-de-force performance as the alien, tries to assimilate into the society and culture with which he has landed in. Humans are portrayed as one might expect hostile, intolerant, greedy, vain, compassionate, understanding, and a range of other emotions. Jeff Bridges shows us us through his learning to adapt to human form. Allen is as always very good in her role showing a good deal of pathos dealing with a life form that looks just like her dead, dearly-missed husband and who she knows is alien. There are many Carpenter touches that reinforce his sometimes overlooked directorial abilities. The film has a taut pace, suspense when needed, comedic interludes, poignant scenes, and an overall message designed to make viewers think.

It goes into much greater detail about the original form of the Starman, and how come our military was able to shoot it down. If you can find the novel, buy it (mine is so tattered by now!) Personally, I do not think that it is 'religious' material at all. It really isn't a 'virgin birth' as some have said (see below)MAJOR SPOILER HERE - the TV series About the baby that Starman left with her, Yes the government DID find out about it. George Fox (same character from the movie) did find out that she had a baby (Scott Hayden (Jr))exactally 9 months after Starman left. From the movie (& novel), Starman says that the only genes are Jenny's & Scott's, but in our DNA there are Blank Spaces and it is there that he wrote information that will make it his too. Jenny and baby Scott were on the run, but she put him up for adoption when he was 3. When he was 14, his foster parents died in a car crash but he unknowingly used his sphere to save himself from it (just like Starman did to save himself & Jenny in the car crash with the gas tanker truck). Unfortunately, a report got to George Fox about the crash, and he started investigating. Scott was placed in an orphanage and was having nightmares of the crash. One night, he went to sleep with his sphere in his hand (all he knew what it was that it was a Gift from your father) and due to these strong emotions, his mind activated it and 'called' his father(Starman). He came back and found a recently dead man and cloned a new body. The Starman & Scott went looking for Jenny who had been hiding from the government, using aliases all this time.Starman's star is (our name for it) is Algibia - in the Sickle of Leo (from TV series episode Starscapes part 1.)Now, sit back and eat your Dutch Apple Pie (with whipped cream) and enjoy (Just remember to use your fork!)

As someone who's seen many of his films, you can almost tell he's uneasy with trying to do a simplistic alien-comes-to-Earth-needs-to-get-home story - not least of which because his evil alien movie, The Thing, was released unjustly within weeks of the 'good' alien movie ET - so he infuses it with an admiration for the conventions while also skewing them just a little for his stylistic sensibilities. The opening twenty minutes, I must say, is pretty close to perfect in its surreal and wild establishment of a premise, and not just because of Carpenter's handling of it all. The special/visual fx are incredible, even by today's standards, as we first see a ship pass by a satellite playing Satisfaction. Then the ship crashes to Earth, and a beam of light (very intriguing, one of the best ideas in the film that is raised about life elsewhere not being in a concrete physical form upon arrival) finds its subject Scott (Jeff Bridges), who died some months early, and left a widow (Karen Allen), who sees this beam of light take shape into her dead husband, from birth until adult-form and bleating out alien language. This, followed by the inevitable push towards the plot of the alien having to reconnect with its own kind on the road, is fantastic storytelling, in how its acted by Bridges and Allen, and the immediate establishment of the themes. It's only when the plot has to go on into its predictable bits, of the government out to get the alien and it/his 'kidnapee' with the typical out-to-get-him general (Richard Jaeckel) as well as the well-intentioned and naturally curious scientist (Charles Martin Smith, who does look cool with a cigar in tow I must say), that it starts to get tricky. There's no real feasible way to pass by this in the sort of mechanics of moving the story along, which is fine. Carpenter doesn't insult the audience too greatly in sticking to conventions, and in fact tries to compensate with some diverting humor in the 'road-trip' form. Scott/alien Bridges is learning as he goes along, sometimes with some very specific and broad questions (Define 'love', what is fuel?), and with the mimic gags put up to a high level. It should get tired after a while, but it's one of the film's strongest and most rewarding points to see Bridges embody what is an alien entity without missing a beat. As the film goes along it should be becoming more human and like the old Scott was, yet Bridges always throws in little ticks and quirks. It's one of his best performances, strangely enough, even when he's given the position of being in a Christ-allegory late in the film.Meanwhile, Allen is game for the material too, and plays the 'straight' part with a grounded quality that gets also to the heart of the scenes. Even in a scene or two that verge on becoming much too sentimental, like the 'what is love' scene in the diner, or when she asks him to show her where the star is where he's from, she doesn't go for any corny angles- like, oddly enough, her part in Raiders of the Lost Ark she believes what she's doing every step of the way. Starman has the right cast, and the best special effects possible for the period (a silly scene with a Superman context of escaping from an exploded car not withstanding), and thankfully Carpenter is able to cull out the ideas that are bubbling under the surface of the archetypes. Like any fun 50's sci-fi effort it faithfully sticks to formula, but there are questions raised about love and compassion for the unknown. It doesn't mean that Carpenter reaches the Spielbergian levels that the script might be aspiring for, and it's a good thing it's not a repeat of a Close Encounters or ET.Quite simply, it's not exactly a great film, and not one particularly to herald as great art all the way through. However if there could possibly be any kind of 'chick flick' that the filmmaker could make, he could've done a lot worse than he did Starman, which remains more than twenty years later oddly touching and occasionally complex.

Oh, sometimes a lower-level general may appear, and sometimes other films have shown some high-level bureaucrats wringing their hands in Washington. But one always wonders.

With Starman, the trail-blazing director shows himself to be more than just a one-trick pony as he steers his focus away from the typical horror and action fare he carved his teeth on in favor for a unique romantic sci-fi story. The result is the director's most under-rated work to date and proof that the man can handle more than one genre at a time with the greatest of ease.Jeff Bridges stars as an alien who finds himself side-tracked upon landing in the backyard of a Wisconsin widow, played by Karen Allen. In order to reach his final destination, he takes the form of her deceased love and the two take to the road. Of course, no sci-fi love story would be complete without interference as the two find themselves being pursued by scientists and military personnel alike who -- you guessed it -- don't have the alien's best interest in mind.Although Starman is admittedly predictable from beginning to end, Carpenter keeps it fresh throughout by keeping the pace going and making sure we are engaged in the ride the whole way through. In true Carpenter fashion, the film looks good and boasts a great soundtrack. Of course, it also helps that Bridges and Allen have excellent chemistry and make for two rather charming leads. Bridges stands out in particular for taking a role that could have been paper-thin and turning it into an odd and endearing character that will be remembered long after the end credits have rolled. In less-caring hands, the film could have been a dud, but thanks to all parties involved, it's an entertaining, engaging and tear-jerking roller-coaster ride that rivals not just other films of its ilk but the rest of Carpenter's filmography as well. Starman is truly a must-see gem of the '80s.

The films relationship to outer space is quickly closed off and the film's focus becomes the relationship between humanity and alien-life as it exists in a complicated relationship of love. Jenny Hayden (played by Karen Allen) finds it difficult to accept that her late husband's image is being used by an alien so it can stay somewhat undercover from our government forces. After Jenny discovers that Starman means her no harm and the alien desperately needs to get him before Earth's elements kill him. Jenny becomes sympathetic towards him and even begins to fall in love. The question that remains is whether or not, with the aid of Jenny, Starman can return home safely.Obviously when you require a human actor to successfully portray a visitor from another planet while in a human body, one needs to choose a talented cast. The acting by Jeff Bridges is exquisite as he is able to show how understanding and misunderstanding the English language as well as facial expressions impacts the level of success in regards to communication. With his limited knowledge of the English language and his unfamiliarity with human expressions, Bridges must portray a being that not only does not understand but does not become frustrated with the complexities of human behavior.This John Carpenter film differs from his other directing jobs simply because he does not use the same style and techniques that he frequently used in films such as Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, and the Fog. Despite being stripped of Carpenter's 'Carpenter-ness', the film is shot very well and keeps it simple. The acting as well as the light-hearted story, carry this film, as opposed to Carpenter using his techniques in the aforementioned films to carry them to their respective conclusions. Overall, this film successfully portrays the love story, the sci-fi subtext, and human misunderstanding.

Along the way, he experiences and learns Earthly cultures and habits and she slowly falls in love with him. Will they reach their destination ?Carpenter's films are often unremittingly bleak, but this is the exception - a lovely, touching, romantic fable. Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon's script (they also wrote Stand By Me) seamlessly weaves together science-fiction, love story and road movie elements into a film bursting with intriguing themes; extra-terrestrial anthropology, a bereavement redeemed, the treachery and the kindness of strangers, and a messianic alien allegory. It's a complex story, but Carpenter's direction is dazzling in its simplicity - he cuts at once to the heart of the drama, the emotion of the piece, making his movie sad, funny, thoughtful, scary, touching and profound. It may be a movie where the hero is an alien, but it's really a movie about what it feels like to be an alien (isolation is Carpenter's ever-present theme), which allows it to focus on the romantic odyssey. We identify with both Starman and Jenny; him because we all understand what it means to feel like an outsider, and her because he brings meaning to a life that had lost all its meaning. Both Bridges and Allen are incredibly good in this film, and their performances truly bring the movie alive. He is a wonder to watch, growing into his new body, mimicking others and entranced by all around him, and she is astonishingly haunting in the depth of her sadness and bewilderment - the last, simple shot of her incredible blue eyes is one of the most moving final images of any movie. The support cast are good, especially Smith as the guy slowly realising he's sold his soul, and Carpenter regular Flower in a lovely scene as the garrulous cook Starman hitches a ride with. Technically, the film is just stunning - Bruce Nicholson's visual effects, Donald M. Morgan's subtle, unhurried photography, Daniel Lomino and Joe Alves' production design, and Jack Nitzsche's fine atonal score are all superb, and create a rich and resonant atmosphere. The movie is filled with astonishing moments (Starman's transformation, Jenny's face when she watches him revive the deer, the freight-train boxcar scene, the reveal shot of the crater) and wonderfully beguiling dialogue (You are a strange species, not like any other, and you would be surprised how many there are. Intelligent, but savage.). Although it contains many of his usual themes (pursuit of freedom, mistrust of authority) this is easily the gentlest and most commercial of Carpenter's films, so even if you normally avoid his work, do not miss this charming picture. If nothing else, the gorgeous Midwest locations of Colorado, Iowa, Tennessee, Utah and the famed Barringer meteor-crater in Arizona are a sensational backdrop for this fantastic story. This is one of those precious few films which seems flawless, with exceptional performances, fabulous imagery, a wonderful and exciting story, and masterful direction. A joy.

In one of life's great injustices, it is the only John Carpenter film to have received an Academy Award nomination, and it is an even greater injustice that Jeff Bridges did not win. If ever there were an example of how to play an alien life form that has come to Earth, showing how he adjusts to human quirks and routines, this is it. It is even more amazing to see Karen Allen turn in a masterful performance as Jenny Hayden, the young widow of the man whose visage our alien assumes. For the first half hour or so of the film, Allen so convincingly shows that she is in mortal terror of her visitor that she sucks the entire audience in on her own. When Bridges demonstrates to her that he means her no harm, she keeps the audience's interest by acting as a proxy for our efforts to understand the protagonist. She has only been in one high-profile film, but it is here that she proves her real mettle in acting.Oddly enough, this is also one of the few films Carpenter directed but did not write the score music for. Instead, that duty is passed on to Jack Nitzsche, who has done nothing so remarkable since if you read his credits. His music is far more conventional than is the norm for a Carpenter film, which makes it contrast well with the bizarre situations the character finds himself in. The sound design, by contrast, is quite minimal, merely foleying the environment the titular alien finds himself in for the most part. Special effects are also kept to a minimum, merely showing the facets of alien technology that our alien has at his disposal. The most elaborate effects occur at the beginning and end of the film, where alien technology makes itself more prominent. For the rest of the time, it is mostly trick photography and clever editing. And it is a testament to Carpenter's skills as a director that it works. The film relies almost entirely upon the actors, in a contrast to modern films, and it works.You will have noticed that my summary calls Starman E.T. for adults. Two years earlier, E.T. had killed Carpenter's previous masterpiece at the box office, but the DVD format gives Carpenter the last laugh. While Spielberg seems to be unable to let today's audiences see his runaway success as it was actually made, Carpenter's film seems even more relevant now than it did in 1984. Not long ago, I wrote a list of the top ten characters shown in film whose mannerisms, displayed emotions, and biographies most resemble the characteristics I have come to associate with Asperger's Syndrome, from my own personal experience. If I had seen Starman before writing this list, then the titular character would be featured somewhere very close to the top, if not right up there at number one. Bridges acts out the desire to learn information it takes most of us years to store in three days, as well as the results of not having it, so well that one could be forgiven for thinking he was in this situation himself.As he has always done, Carpenter shoots Starman in a Panavision aspect ratio, and as always, he makes such brilliant use of the frame that panning and scanning it should be considered criminal. We fine people for defacing public property, after all. Granted, Carpenter is not as dynamic as Sergio Leone, but he does approach that level in a number of shots. He also seems uncannily aware of how his shots will turn out after the special effects are added, making his scenes so visually compelling at times that they approach an alien quality. The only moment where his vision is exceeded by the limitations of his technical staff is the near-to-final shot in which the alien vessel makes its appearance. It was probably laughable even back then, but fortunately it is only used in a couple of shots, as Carpenter demonstrates his ability to tell when a solid performance from an actor will serve his purposes better than an elaborate attempt to convince the viewer they are seeing something they are not.Sadly, Starman became yet another brilliant idea from Carpenter that got lost in the changing economics of the film industry as the theatres became more and more the exclusive province once more of the major outlets. Finding itself marooned on home video and stripped of much of its photographic beauty, it has only been since it found its way to DVD-Video that Starman has been able to find its proper place in the market. Much like the 1970s, the 1980s is a time that self-imposed historians of culture would like us to believe brought us nothing of value, but like Devo or Tron, Starman stands for all time as a mark against them. It is a film that could only have been made in the 1980s, with 1980s culture and a truly 1980s view of the world with both the attendant beauty and the attendant ugliness hopefully preserved for when we truly are ready to make contact with an alien civilisation. Speaking as someone who is as alien as the human race is (not) ready to deal with at present, I can say we have much further to go than even Starman gives us credit for.For all these reasons, and others, I gave Starman a ten out of ten. They do not make films like it anymore, and that is a real shame.

The main reason for which Carpenter directed 'Starman' was that after the box-office disaster of The Thing (1982), he needed to make a movie that was the complete opposite of what 'The Thing' was so he could continue to work in Hollywood . The pic obtained important reception by the public and attained quite a few success at box office . Some years later , it was followed by a television series with Robert Hays as Starman . The yarn will appeal to science fiction and romantic cinema fans. Rating  Good and enjoyable.

She meets Starman, and he would emulate her screaming, and everything else surrounding him as well. He has these tiny spheres that can do many things. When the woman got shot by the law, Starman used one of the spheres to protect him and her when h rams the car into the tanker. He would later spend the whole night healing her. It was a bit of a hoot when one of the people from the government decides to disobey the leader rather than helping him. Perhaps one day, Starman would return and give mankind a peace of mind.

The witty and romantic love story between an alien and an earthling and situated in the eighties is in more than one way reminiscent of the good old sixties when concern for others was as natural as the present trend is to consider the cult of the ego as the sole aim in life. When Jenny gives her definition of love as total abandonment in the interest of the loved one ( or something along those lines), the viewer is immediately reminded of days gone by when Love Story and Jesus Christ Superstar seemed to be as much a part of our lives as Desperate Housewives is today. Starman is a movie for people who have not become completely cynical and knowingly kid themselves into believing that adult fairy tales really do exist.Jeff Bridges is a true artist who really excels when he portrays weired or borderline personalities as he also did so well in Jagged Edge and The Vanishing.

What if an alien species did pick this message up and decided to visit us? That's the concept behind Starman. Starman's particular breed of species stumbles upon Voyager II and sends one of its own (the Bridges character) to visit Earth. However,in spite of our invitation, American government and military personnel, perceiving this as some kind of threat of invasion, have the Starman's ship shot down upon reaching Earth. The ship crashes in some woods of Wisconsin and then enters the home of a widow, assuming the identity of her recently deceased house painter husband (Bridges) via hair in a photo album. The Starman then has the widow (Allen) drive him cross country to Arizona to meet the mother ship in 3 days. This journey becomes complicated by their pursuit of the military and government agents who want to take the Starman and study him.What's interesting about this movie in the beginning it appears like it could be a possible thriller/(horror, maybe) because we do not know anything about the Starman at first or what his (its) intentions are exactly. However, as the movie progresses, the Starman gradually grows more human and not robot-like like it was initially. Superior acting by Bridges.

After a while however I found it grating and annoying. Why can he not learn to speak properly? He figures everything else out without too much trouble but speaking seems beyond him. Even if we assume that his species don't use the medium of tongue flapping and instead communicate through their minds this doesn't explain his awkwardness using a tongue, he gets to grip with legs, arms, eating, pretty much every function he probably didn't have before this movie begins he picks up in no time at all. OK, so he has those little head twitches which show he is not comfortable using a neck I presume. So why isn't he stuttering using his knee joints or any other myriad number of joints the human body has to offer. If this had been done right there would have been a progression throughout the film of him coming to terms with all the human faculties, but the ones they decided to let him struggle with leave us with an endearing? alien. He had the means to learn the language before he went to earth so why didn't he?The dark descent into ridiculousness continues when he uses his magic 'balls' to uproot a few trees to scare off a guy shouting at him, to bring a deer back to life, and of course the lonely heroine. He doesn't think to use a ball to knock around the guys beating him up at the diner? He doesn't have any sense of self preservation which is essential to the survival of any species, speeding through the lights even though a lorry is bearing down on him. They have presumably evolved to a point where nobody dies but this is inherently ridiculous, and just paves the way for some bible bashing for the rest of the movie about how primitive and barbaric we are. It's easy for him to give his self righteous garbage about no living thing needing to die since he doesn't need to eat to survive. Let's all be vegetarians?Then we descend further into the murky abyss of ridiculousness with him apparently being able to tell the future of his unborn son who was conceived only the previous night using at least some of his magic 'balls' I presume. Then we learn that the lovable, preachy, deers have a right to life alien is in favour of abortion. Now this is murky water, but I think the moral ground liberals propose that abortion is alright is that the baby isn't actually alive, but it sure as hell smudges the moral lines when you know the child's entire future, suggesting that yes, the child is actually alive but this alien doesn't care. I presume that this is how his species who never die keep a firm grasp on population control on their planet. Their generation has an iron grasp on life and they aren't giving it up for future generations for anything, not even the right to life that he's been magnanimously drawling on about subtly throughout. It's almost as if someone with a strong pro abortion agenda wrote and produced this film as a mass pro abortion campaign. I guess we'll never know.Then he magically turns a quarter into a small fortune without using any sort of ball at all this time, by going into the nearest casino. Must have been lucky I guess. That ridiculous government guy is as cheesy and as forced a baddie character as I've ever seen. Then we get some more sloganeering at the end to give the false sense of something deep and meaningful. The sheer lack of anything having happened in this movie is offset by an overly zealous government official who gets the national guard out of bed to give the audience some helicopters to look at. At the very end you are left wondering why in god's name he even bothered to come to earth at all. He didn't do or talk to anyone important at all. You'd swear his mission was to impregnate the woman and leave since that's all he accomplished.All in all, a very average movie which I felt compelled to review since I don't understand the amount of positivity this is getting. Maybe Jeff Bridges nomination convinced a few people that this was a good performance and not what it actually is. An outrageously over acted and ridiculous film with every cheesy stereotype in the book for good measure.

The problem is that he's crash landed somewhere in Wisconsin, so he must more or less kidnap Allen and have her accompany him to the rendezvous site, with the police and the U. S. Army hot on their trail.As a kind of extraterrestrial anthropologist, Bridges must learn the speech and customs of his host country little by little. This leads to the expected but amusing sequences of his learning how to eat in a diner, how to give someone the finger, how to punch back when he's hit, and so forth.Of course Bridges comes to acquire all the feelings of her late husband's body, the one he's appropriated, and -- well, I guess I don't have to draw you a picture of what happens after that.It's a feel-good movie with lots of smiles and warmth. The holes in the plot may be the size of the crater in Crater National Monument but who cares? Majestic organ chords strike resonant notes in the viewers' cockles. The clutter of junk at the bottom of the crater -- left a hundred years ago by diggers who thought the meteor might be made of precious metal -- is carefully avoided in all the shots so as to promote the feeling of a pristine natural feature. He's as innocent as a new-born babe which, in a cultural sense, he is. But for no particular reason, the agents of social control are in hot pursuit. They seem to hate him. They're led by a major suit, the reliable and familiar Richard Jaekel, whose character's name is George Fox. I don't know if it was intentional -- probably not -- but in the old military phonetic alphabet George stood for the letter G, and Fox stood for F. George Fox was an offhand and polite way of telling someone to get lost.

With the government on their trail the Starman and Jenny go on a road trip to take him to Arizona where Starman will be able to get back his planet. While on the trip Starman and Jenny get to know each other and fall in love.During his career,master Director John Carpenter has made five films dealing with Aliens with Horror,Action and SCI-FI,his funny feature film debut Dark Star(1974),the excellent and terrifying The Thing(1982),the brilliant and thrilling They Live(1988)and the underrated and entertaining Ghosts Of Mars(2001). In between those four films came Starman in 1984,a wonderful SCI-FI-Romance that was a modest success at the Box Office,earned an Academy Award nomination for Jeff Bridges,spawned a short lived television series and next to Big Trouble In Little China is Carpenter's lightest film that remains underrated and gives people a different side to Carpenter that wasn't seen before this film. Starman is a movie that is while giving viewers a familiar tale remains re-watchable mixing together elements of not only SCI-FI and Romance but also Road Movie,Fantasy,Adventure with a little bit of Humor that is beautiful and amazing and told in a large scale that grabs viewers from the moment you watch it. Starman greatly mixes together the genres SCI-FI and Romance pretty well. The SCI-FI elements are dazzling leaving you with thrills and awe from a visual standpoint showing from showing how the Starman lands on earth and how he uses his power for good not evil because Starman is one of the nicest Aliens in movie history. One of the main reasons Starman works is the focus on the relationship and love that develops between Starman and Jenny despite being Alien and human. The moments of dialog,interaction and romance between Starman and Jenny keeps the movie going wanting you to see where it's going to go even though the government is after both of them. The love and Romance feels real and genuine with a lot of heart that connects with viewers on an emotional level and you would want Starman and Jenny to be together forever. If you watched Carpenter's other films you should already know he's never been the most sentimental or Romantic filmmaker but he does a great job with the Love and Romance in the movie. As the journey on the road goes along Starman not only starts to fall in love with Jenny but starts to act more human doing things that regular people do and when we see the scenes with Starman being human it's funny as it is touching whether it's winning money on a Casino slot machine or trying to smoke a cigarettes. Starman also tells a character how he feels about the people on earth and one of the reasons he visited Earth. Some have compared Starman with Steven Spielberg's classic ET which came out two years before Starman some calling this movie ET for adults and while the two have similarities without a doubt both stand on their own. The ending of Starman is terrific,beautiful and matches the tone of the movie leaving viewers with optimism and hope. An amazing conclusion.The cast is great. Jeff Bridges is excellent and at his best as Starman,with Bridges being sweet and amusing. Karen Allen is wonderful and beautiful as Jenny Hayden,Starman's love interest. Charles Martin Smith is terrific as Mark Sherman,a scientist. Richard Jaeckel is great as George Fox,a National Security Director. George 'Buck' Flower(Cook),Dirk Blocker(Cop#1),M.C Gainey(Cop#2)and Ted White(Deer Hunter)give good performances as well;.The direction by John Carpenter is amazing,with Carpenter always moving the camera and bringing a great flare and style to the film. Terrific direction,Carpenter.The score by Jack Nlitzsche is fantastic,beautiful and awe-inspiring matching the movie perfectly.

His Spielberg side. 'Starman' is certainly Spielbergian, feeling equal parts 'E.T.' and 'Close Encounters', but Carpenter never lets it stray into mimicry. The script isn't quite as sentimental as early Spielberg, but it also lacks Carpenter's trademark cynicism. Instead it feels like a more mature, adult take on the themes explored in 'E.T.'.While skillfully directed and featuring a (mostly) solid script, the bulk of the credit for the movie's success goes to Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen. Bridges' performance at first seems too affected, but as the movie progresses you understand what he was doing and you can clearly see the arc for his character's growth as he becomes more comfortable with his body and begins to learn about being human. He was nominated for an Academy Award for the role, and it's easy to see why. But the real star here is Allen. Perhaps best known as Marion from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', she's the heart and soul of the story, grounding all of the fantastical elements and keeping the focus on the humanity of it.I'd never seen 'Starman', and truthfully had little interest until my friend and I chose the short-lived 'Starman' TV series as the next subject for our blog.

The plot involves an alien, played by Jeff Bridges, taking the form of Karen Allen's dead husband and asking her to drive him across state to his spaceship. Bridges is marvellous in his role as the curious and likable alien &#x96; a well- deserved Oscar nomination was given to him. In fact, he's the only actor in a John Carpenter movie to be nominated for an Oscar. Bridges takes the role as an occasion to give us some sweetly affecting characterisation and it showcases his charm and precision as an actor. Though on paper this looks like a very sill movie, it turns out to be of the most touching and funny love stories from the 80's. Carpenter purists may look down upon this film for its family- friendly appeal and PG rating but he showed real maturity in Starman by keeping an emphasising on close human emotions rather than shocks and special effects. As a lot of alien films do, Starman asks questions about our nature as human beings and our impact on planet Earth. It does so in a way, however, without getting preachy. It's moving, in fact, as is the romance. And this is coming from a guy who generally despises romantic films. Best Scene Like most Carpenter films, Starman has a memorable ending. In this case, the film closes on Allen's face, full of wonder, as she looks up at the mothership taking Bridges home. It is accompanied by a poignant score which Carpenter, a rarity for him, wisely did not compose. Another thing I like about the ending is that it does not allow itself to get bogged down in politics &#x96; for all we know the government may have shot her a minute after the credits started rolling, or she may have become a drunk hobo 20 years down the line and jumped off of a bridge. But we don't need to know that.

Whether he proved his point or not is open to interpretation, although the fact that Starman was essentially his last big budget movie during the 80's and the director eventually kept spiraling farther away from the mainstream is probably evidence that this film didn't go as planned either. What Carpenter did accomplish though in the process, is craft the best serious take on an encounter with an alien civilization, at least until Contact came along.Compared to any other of Carpenter's films, Starman is perhaps the most singular and also the most genre-bending of any of his projects. You might have thought he pushed the envelope with Big Trouble in Little China, but Starman goes even further. The story is part alien encounter, part road movie, part romance and manages to mix its elements competently and switch gears expertly, propelled by two great performance by a young Jeff Bridges (this was his first Oscar nomination) and Karen Allen. Production values are also very high. Special effects, although not ubiquitous, are very imaginative and brilliantly executed whenever they occur. There are several shots in this one that have become iconic, such as the Starman transformation sequence early in the film, accomplished through a rare collaboration of two effects masters of the period, Stan Winston and Rick Baker. The movie is also graced with a spectacular score by Jack Nitzsche, elevating scenes like the finale into levels of otherworldly beauty.When it comes to Carpenter films, I consider this to be his finest, even compared to such gems as The Thing and Halloween. The fact that this isn't even remotely a horror film, so far from the director's comfort zone, makes it all the more remarkable. A classic and some of the most intelligent sci-fi you are ever going to find.

Jenny is recently widowed and still overindulges in the then-sweet-but-now-tormenting memories of his dead husband Scott, so the intrusion of Starman who regenerates himself into a human form of Scott through his hair kept in Jenny's photo album actually gives an impossible chance for Jenny to fall in love with Scott again, thus despite the initial terror to witness the metamorphosis of an unearthly creature turning into Scott, Jenny accepts him almost instantly as subconsciously she knows that her dream comes true in a supernatural version. The pair drives across the country to reach the picking-up location in Arizona, where a mother-ship will take Starman back as it has planned.En route, the affecting binding progress between them takes a lion's share of the film and romance burgeons inevitably and a nice job done by generously allowing Starman some time to learn in his new form as a male human in this three-day span, the film never intend to be a taut action piece or a CGI-ridden arena for Starman to show off his superpower other than when the plot requires, emotion always comes first, even poetically, which one might find it unexpectedly against Carpenter's grain, Jenny and Starman are each other's savior, once they builds the trust and affections, they are inseparable. As corny as that he resuscitates her from death, cures her infertility and gives her a baby boy, whereas she has the relentless will power to bring him to the appointed venue, to eventually save his life, Carpenter and his two leads pull it off satisfactorily. Bridges garners a surprising Oscar-nomination here, he demonstrates a primitive method as a newcomer habituating, mimicking and grasping human behavior, impressively carries on his otherworldliness through the journey with advanced nuances in gesticulation and language capacity. Allen brings about a force of momentum in her more mundane part, overwhelmed by the frisson of regaining and losing again of her true love, she and Bridges share many intimately heartfelt moments in this fanciful tall-tale, its CGI effects inescapably seem dated, but the kernel of its message - to evoke the basic humanity within us, leaves viewers a somewhat palatable taste which injects the movie a vital strength to be finely appreciated.

Apparently someone has and we were far from ready for it.A shape shifting alien is down for a look/see and when he arrives he takes the image of Karen Allen's late husband who looks a whole lot like Jeff Bridges.Though Bridges got a Best Actor nomination in my opinion the best performance in the film is from Karen Allen. Throughout the film she is registering all kinds of feelings and emotions multiple emotions at the same time like any of us would facing her situation. Imagine an alien creature taking the form of your significant other who has passed on?Obviously Voyager II's invitation should have been destination specific like the United Nations in New York or since the USA did build and launch the probe, Washington, DC. But instead it lands in rural Wisconsin and he's got to make a rendezvous for a pickup in Arizona, the heart of red state America where folks are having trouble dealing with all kinds of humans different from them. Bridges in the title role is a wonderful combination of genius and ingenuous. He's centuries beyond humans in his evolutionary development but a mere child in dealing with humans other than Karen Allen. But he's a quick learner and note he never harms a living soul.There's another conflict going on, one between scientist Charles Martin Smith who'd like to study and learn from Bridges and Richard Jaeckel the military man who wants to capture him and become light years technologically advanced. We are still in a Cold War. One shudders to think had he landed in the Soviet Union or in China. Probably no better than here and most assuredly worse.Bridges certainly takes on all the physiological aspects of male humankind and after a night of passion on a train boxcar with Allen all kinds of theological questions are raised since he most assuredly tells Allen she's pregnant from the encounter and their kid will grow up to be a great teacher.Unusual for a science fiction film Star Man does not depend on awesome special effects, they are there but not the main focus of the story. No accident that the film didn't receive any Oscar recognition in the technical categories. Just a nomination for Bridges and one that should have happened for Karen Allen. Both of them put over a fine and startling story.

The mood resembles both E.T. and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and this is no bad thing at all. The performances from Bridges and Allen are pretty exceptional and extremely heart-warming with more than one 'weepie' moment occurring throughout the playing time. Carpenter has a very under-rated eye for emotion and comedy and he uses the former to great effect here and you really can't help but be touched by the end of the film and for a labelled 'horror' director that is something very exceptional and why he is one of the all time great directors.So instant classic? Not quite!Starman has problems and this is where it falls just short of the epic it could have been.The main issue is with the pacing. The film is so incredibly slow that it really takes a bit of effort to keep with it. It is not until the last 20 minutes or so that things pick up a little and we are gripped that little bit tighter and things become really enjoyable.Starman has all the elements of a true epic classic but it sacrifices hook for displays of innocence and emotion. The story and script is great, the cast is amazing, the film looks good, the FX are nice and the score is touching.

All I can say is, what a treat! Starman remains an exceptional movie-watching experience over 25 years after its release.THE PLOT (**minor plot spoilers**) An alien crashlands in Wisconsin and is able to take the form of Jenny Hayden's dead husband via the DNA from a lock of his hair. Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen star in these roles. The alien needs Jenny to take 'him' to a rendezvous site, the huge crater near Winslow, Arizona. Jenny understandably feels kidnapped, at first, but starts to see things that may change change her perception. Meanwhile, the government led by George Fox (Richard Jaeckel, the MP from The Dirty Dozen) wants to capture the alien for nefarious purposes. This presents a moral conundrum for Mark Shermin (Charles Martin Smith) who comes to realize that the alien was responding to a message he sent out to space for the government. Will he side with the cold-hearted Feds or risk his bread & butter to possibly help the alien? (**end spoilers**) Starman possesses a palpable sense of wonder and beauty, as well as drama, thrills and suspense, not to mention one laugh-out-loud scene (I won't give it away but a grim state trooper figures in).It's interesting to note the many films that have ripped-off Starman. For instance, Thelma and Louise and the more recent Race to Witch Mountain, the latter essentially being a more action-packed, kid-friendly version of the vastly superior Starman (although I still enjoyed it). Yet Starman does its own 'ripping-off,' e.g. the kissing scenes from the Original Star Trek episode By Any Other Name. The Eastern scenes were shot in central Tennessee and Cedar Rapids, while the Western Locations include Colorado, Arizona, Las Vegas and Monument Valley. It's a nice mix of East & West.The film runs 115 minutes.FINAL WORD If you haven't seen Starman for awhile, be sure to give it a fresh viewing.

Certainly most of it is not new. The idea of an alien assuming the identity of a human being is straight out of It Came from Outer Space, which was the progenitor of all films about alien visitation. We have also seen the scenario of a misunderstood, peace-loving visitor from another world being pursued by ignorant and vicious earthlings. The uniqueness of Starman lies mainly in the romance that slowly develops between the two main characters. It is quite touching, and yields a totally unexpected blessing. There are also moments of magic throughout, and even touches of humor, something you don't often find in a film of this kind. And I don't want to forget the soundtrack, which is mesmerizing. My only complaint is that Jenny exhibits an unbelievable lack of curiosity. Sitting beside a being from another galaxy on a lengthy road trip, she doesn't ask a single question about his world. In the beginning, of course, she is fearful for her life and is only thinking about escaping. But when she knows he isn't a threat, she still doesn't ask him anything. This doesn't detract from the film, but it seems worth mentioning.

But this movie is just lovely and it has that Sci-Fi mystery feel to it.Now Jeff Bridges as Starman is just magnificent, he definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this. I also liked Charles Martin Smith as Mark Shermin. Maybe a bit of a stereo-typical Sci-Fi character, but the movie would have been a bit boring without him. Now I must admit Karen Allen as Jenny Hayden annoyed me a bit in the start as she was an very naive character. I instantly knew that the manuscript of this film was not written by John Carpenter. the character was not bad, i only wish they would make a film, where the person that finds the alien doesn't just freak out and acts like an idiot. Now as I said this is not Carpenters best movie, but it is far from bad. i was happy to see that he was given the chance to show that he can make romantic and funny movies and just not horror. i personally prefer Carpenter as the master of horror, but this movie helped him recover after the bad reception of the Thing which ironically is in most Carpenter fans opinion his best film.Nevertheless this was an charming movie, funny, and it had some great special effects.

Oh, and despite the fact that he has responded to the official invite included in the Voyager II it seems that people in power are worried and determined to stop him from getting away.It's nothing we haven't seen before. We have the usual fish-out-of-water situations as Bridges learns some of the finer points of human interaction, there's the overall chase scenario, the special powers to be sparingly used and the one member of the team tasked with finding the couple who appears sympathetic to their plight (a great turn from Charles Martin Smith). Thankfully, it's all done well and with a nice, fine balance between the alien and the human in terms of reactions, emotions and deeds done en route to the rendezvous.The movie really revolves around the central pairing of Bridges and Allen and they give superb performances. Allen has, arguably, the tougher role as she fights her disbelief and struggles with her feelings for someone who looks exactly like the love of her life but whom she knows is not. Bridges does very well portraying a child-like curiosity and yearning for knowledge, he's a sensitive soul who wants to help but can also take care of things when backed into a corner. As the creature even struggles with mouthing the English vocabulary it's a performance that could have been laughable in places but somehow just manages to avoid it.John Carpenter has, of course, dabbled with sci-fi elsewhere in his career but never (to date) in such a heart-warming way. I am a fan of pretty much everything the man does so am totally biased but I think this is yet another film from the man that many can appreciate and enjoy for many years. Perhaps a few notches down from his best work but a decent film nonetheless and one that deserves to be seen by more people who perhaps thought the only alien to visit us in the early 80s was a little guy who wanted to phone home.See this if you like Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, The Brother From Another Planet, K-PAX.

That's a tough act to bring off, as so sadly manifested in countless portrayals of movie aliens from the '50s to the present day. In my extremely humble opinion, it is Jeff Bridges' best performance, period. Karen Allen is her winsome self, first terrified, then confused, and finally resolved in love to the unique human form Bridges' alien has chosen to assume. Charlie Martin Smith, one of the most under-appreciated actors of his generation, is perfectly cast. Cameron's direction -- in a film you wouldn't have expected Carpenter to helm -- is some of HIS best work, and it all comes together as a hugely-satisfying and triumphal examination of what it is to be human, and how our innate humanity and love can extend even to the most unlikely and unbelievable circumstances and beings. Columbia may have ditched E.T. and lost a pot of easy money thereby, but they got the better movie, by far. I can't recommend this film highly enough.Bart "},{"Title":"Not bad.

This results in his 80s movies to not age well at all according to my standards. Some older movies, such as Alien or E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial for example, are much more appealing to modern audiences. This being said, I still do appreciate some 80s Carpenter movies, and Starman was entertaining enough, although somewhat silly in it's execution. I don't know if it looked silly to audiences back when it was released (I was minus 2 years old in the making at the time), but my feeling is that if it were screened today in 2011, audiences would laugh at many parts of the movie. Starman does have an intended comedic element, since the visitor obviously struggles with cultural misunderstandings which leads to awkward situations, yet I believe modern audiences would more likely laugh at the ridiculousness of it, and not because it's clever comedy.Starman was released two years after Spielberg's E.T., and follows loosely the same plot. A friendly extraterrestrial comes to earth and is helped to go home (he'll die if he stays) by one or more initially frightened humans, while the aggressive government and military want to capture him. The fact that Starman seems to plagiarize E.T. can't be a held against it, since the scripts for both movies were written at the same time. Unfortunately for Starman, E.T. is a much superior movie, whether it is in plot, acting, suspense or wonder.Karen Allen is both beautiful and simple, thus she fits perfectly for her role as a lonely and sensitive widow. Her acting is sufficiently good, not praise-worthy, but very acceptable. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar for best actor with his role as the extraterrestrial, and honestly, I don't see why. I think Bridges is a phenomenal actor, and he played his role accordingly in Starman, which means he stays pretty much passive throughout the story, with a few eccentricities when he tries to imitate human facial expressions. Thus his role wasn't difficult in my opinion, and was certainly playable by any low-level actor. Hence the Oscar nomination for such an easy role is surprising to me.One particularly interesting and original moment in Starman is at the beginning, when the extraterrestrial transforms into human form by imitating (cloning) the DNA from a man's lock of hair which was kept by the man's widow (Allen). In front of a terrified widow, the extraterrestrial progressively (monstrously) grows from the shape of a baby to a fully adult and naked Jeff Bridges, this in a matter of minutes.

The concept is indeed interesting and to a large extend, the concept gets it's due. But there are hiccups, which every film does! 'Starman' tells the story of an Alien, who takes the form of a young widow's husband and asks her to drive him from Wisconsin to Arizona to complete his mission.Like mentioned, this 1984 flick has potential and it must be said, that the first hour is indeed excellent. The chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen is superb, and acts as one of the major plus-points of the film. But the problem lies in it's writing, which loses pace in the final 30-minutes. It doesn't get boring, but you get a hitch in your seat. Even the culmination, appears half-baked.John Carpenter's direction is good. The screenplay is mostly super, but gets a bit dirty in the final 30-minutes. Donald M. Morgan's Cinematography is perfect.Performance-Wise Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen are the life of 'Starman'. Bridges delivers a remarkable performance as an alien, while Karen plays her part with absolute ease. And their chemistry, as told, is superb.On the whole, 'Starman' may not be a classic for all, but it surely is a good flick to watch. Recommended!

And yet he does a blinding job, and STARMAN proves to be a fine little movie; in parts poignant, touching and altogether human.Although this film came out in the wake of E.T., I find it superior to the overly-sentimental Spielberg movie. The storyline is subtle and the developing central relationship is slow paced, taking time to get to know the protagonists and present them in a realistic light. The love story between Allen and Bridges is low key throughout, and even the love scenes are handled sensitively.Allen has always seemed to me to be a completely natural actress, free from artifice; she has a rare ability to inhabit her roles which makes you wonder why she didn't become a bigger name. Opposite her in an Oscar-nominated performance stands Jeff Bridges, playing it kooky and mannered as the alien-in-a-man's-body; there's something oddly moving about his role in this film and he soon had me completely engaged in his character.Yes, I'll admit that I shed a tear or two at the moving climax, even though I'm a totally non-romantic person when it comes to films and you can usually find me watching gory horror flicks instead. Saying that, watch out for the utterly eerie scene at the opening when a baby transforms into a man. This scene scared the hell out of me when I saw it as a kid, and even today the icky sound and physical effects bring to mind a certain ice-bound Carpenter classic!

It was events of both the closing days of the Big War, as well as some non-related occurrences that brought us up to the Visitors From Other Worlds movie.THE EXPLOSION OF the two Atomic Bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki brought mankind to a new threshold of science, warfare and the resulting phobias and neurosis that have plagued us ever since. Never before had we known of the power to totally destroy both Our whole World and the entire Human Race, virtually at once.ADDED TO THIS is the technology of Rocket Science, long being around in mainly theory; but now proved, although admittedly in its infancy. And just what or who were the causes of this development of rocketry as a means of delivering weapons systems to enemy cities without having to be manned? It was the work off Dr. Werner von Braun und hiss colleagues, together mit dere V1 und V2 .USE OF THIS type of technology in WWII, mainly against out friends in Allied England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (Now called the U.K. for United Kingdom) that brought a new dimension to our mastery of the skies. Whereas the V1 or 'Buzz Bomb' was basically what we would now refer to as being a 'Drone'or unmanned aircraft*, the V2 was the nearly perfect prototype for all future rockets; be the I.C.B.M., or whatever.ADD TO ALL this hysteria about things in our skies, the occurrences that occurred around Roswell, New Mexico, July 8, 1947. It was then that the sketchy details about what was first described as a FLYING SAUCER; later revised down to being debris from a Weather Balloon, permanently changed our perception of our relationship with the Cosmos. Also, two new terms were to be ever in our language were coined then. They were UFO, for Unidentified Flying Object and Flying Saucer.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, POPULAR art forms and printed matter jumped on the new bandwagon, which was on a long trip building up steam and an ever growing constituency of Saucer believers. A seemingly never ending deluge of Space oriented pulp magazines, comic books, toys and movies for the Matinée, bubble gum crowd.HOLLYWOOD'S OUTPUT FROM this period was mainly occupied with attacks from those from other worlds; most always our being saved by a noble alliance of our Scientists with the Military. Sympathetic characterizations of Alien Invaders were almost non existent.REMEMBER THAT ALMOST only counts in Horseshoes, as one of the very best stories of extra-terrestrial visitors, then, now or ever, would come to the movie houses and become an instant classic. That film was, of course, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (20th Century-Fox, 1951); which of course starred Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal.AS GREAT AS this film was, it only took us so far; for all through the story, Klatuu (Mr. Rennie)managed to remain quite aloof of we earthlings. He departed in much the same manner as he left; his mission being completed, all completely business-like and all. No room for any romancin' the local girls here.WITH REGARD TO today's lucky honoree, STARMAN (Delphi II/Industrial Light & Magic/Columbia Pictures, 1984), relationships with friendly, altruistically motivated Alien Beings was taken some steps ahead of where KLatuu & Gort (his giant robot)left off. The visiting being has the ability to assume the physical make up and appearance of what ever creatures he encounters. In this case, he quickly clones a duplicate of heroine's deceased husband. The Lady, Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen-Woo,Woo,Woo,Woo!)is understandably frightened with his sudden appearance.BUT THE TWO become great friends in a cross country the real brilliance of the film becomes evident. Starman (Jeff Bridges) plays the character as if he were a completely blank cassette of recording tape, approaching everything about life on Planet Earth for the first time. For example after observing Jrnny's driving habits and repeating them, he says this about traffic signals, Red means Stop, Green means Go, Yellow means Go Very Fast! THIS IS THE essence of the film and it works very well; including the very intimate situations that the two inter-stellar lovers find themselves in.OH YEAH, THERE'S also a very fine supporting cast, headed up by Charles Martin Smith, Richard Jaeckel and Robert Phalen.NOTE * The V1 Buzz Bomb had the appearance of a small airplane, with wings, general shape and took off in much the same manner. The V2's design was remarkably advanced; as little if any improvements were made in Rocket design in the ensuing years. It was a case of If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

No, not entirely original, since I mentioned before this movie is like The Day the Earth Stood Still , meets Solyaris, meets E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial done John Carpenter style. This however doesn't mean that this movie isn't good on its own right though. It's an effective movie with all of its themes, though it also needs to be said that the movie is also a bit of a lackluster and I wish some more was happening in this movie and it went just a bit further with its themes at times.

Several years later the answer arrives in an alien (Jeff Bridges) who takes the form of a woman's dead husband. Soon the alien and woman (Karen Allen) are trying to get from Wisconsin to Arizona so that he can return to his planet and along the way get to understand human nature. It's funny that in 1982 Carpenter's THE THING was pretty much destroyed at the box office by Steven Spielberg's E.T. and then two years later it appeared the director was giving his own version of that film. I think there are a lot of similarities between the two films, although I think this one falls well short as the masterpiece status of the Spielberg film. The direction and performances are certainly what keep this film going even when the screenplay goes off track. Bridges rightfully picked up an Oscar-nomination for his performance of the alien. There had been hundreds of actors who played aliens by the time 1984 came around but I think Bridges managed to deliver something quite original and certainly very memorable. That incredible walk, that innocent nature to want to learn and the way Bridges makes the character just take in everything he's experiencing is something only a very talented actor could have done. The performance is original and certainly unlike anything we had seen before. Allen is also quite good here and she appears to always get overlooked and especially when it comes to this film. I thought the early scenes with her struggling with the alien and the memory of her dead husband were quite touching and the actress had no problems pulling this connection off. The two have a wonderful chemistry together and even when the screenplay gets pretty far-fetched in terms of their love story, the two are still so great that you want to believe what you're seeing. Charles Martin Smith adds nice support as does Richard Jaeckel. I think there are a few major problems with the film and one is the 115-minute running time, which gets to be a tad bit slow as the film moves on. I know a lot of people seem unhappy with the slow opening twenty-minutes but I actually enjoyed this part of the film as it perfectly set up the characters. I think the journey towards the end becomes way too predictable and the screenplay never sold me on the woman being able to fall in love with this alien. Again, the actors make it nice but at the same time the screenplay never sells it. As you'd expect in a Carpenter film, the cinematography is terrific as is the music score both of which really add another dimension to the picture. STARMAN has become a cult classic over the past couple decades and I think it's certainly a special little gem even though it falls well short of some of the other films the director made during this period.

Naturally this puts the fear of God into his widow, Jenny Hayden, who has still not yet got over his loss. With his craft lost, the Starman knows he must make it to his rendezvous point within three days of he will die. He forces Jenny to drive him there. Initially she fears him but with time she starts to trust him and help him with his journey.Perhaps most famous for being the film that a studio picked instead of ET, my memory of seeing this film when I was much younger was not good &#150; I found it boring is all I recall but then I was younger so I figured I'd try again. Although I found it better than boring I can understand why I got that impression as a youngster because it is pretty plodding and obvious for the most part. As soon as the Starman takes the form of the grieving Jenny's husband, everyone should know where this is going and, although it is not badly delivered, the film needed to do more than just go through the obvious plot thread &#150; which is sadly just what it does. The development of the relationship is nice enough but there is little depth or originality to it. The alien learning things and being slightly bemused by things very quickly gets old (not helped by the lack of heart or humour in doing it) and there isn't much more beyond that. Carpenter directs well but he can't produce what isn't there in the script.Likewise the cast can only do the obvious and they don't do it that well. Bridges seems to be stuck in a very robotic performance that limits his ability to find depth. I can understand why he does it but it doesn't help the film. This leaves Allen to carry the whole bag and she isn't up to it. She does the obvious but she doesn't convince with her emotions and reactions to the wider story. Smith and Jaeckel are nice distractions from the rather sappy main story as they run around arguing morals but they aren't given enough time and I would have liked them to have more time to develop this side of the story.Overall this is an OK film but one that doesn't do anything special or original. The cast and direction do what they can but they can't get over that the script is pretty obvious and predictable. Those accustomed to television movies and daytime filler will love it but personally I wanted much more than it delivered and found it lacking on many levels.

Smart aliens I guess.So they send out a probe to visit earth which the government welcomes by shooting it down. Amazing that aliens that can build a phonograph to play a record, decipher English and send a craft to earth, were taken down by conventional weapons. But Hell, by now all believability is out the window.Then, the amazingly advanced alien ball of light that crashed in Wisconsin transforms himself to look like the dead husband of Jenny Haden (Karen Allen). And he happens to have seven magical balls, one of which he wastes on resurrecting a dead deer.But it gets worse. He basically forces her to drive him to Arizona, because if he doesn't get there in 3 days he'll die. Was the writer of this film taking heavy narcotics? Okay, I can buy aliens intelligent enough to figure out how to play a phonograph record, understand an unknown language, transform themselves into any given human form and raise the dead.But what follows, the road trip romance, the bulk of the film, destroys the intelligent alien factor we've had to believe so far to follow the plot. Why? It all comes down to how Jeff Bridges plays the part like the little girl in Small Wonder. The head twitching, robotic like movements and stupidity just don't jive with such an advanced race. And&#x85; they are highly annoying.Don't get me wrong. I think Jeff Bridges is a great actor. But the way he plays this alien character is unbearable and destroys the film.
