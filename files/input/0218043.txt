[{"Title":"Superb documentary","Date":"23 October 2005","Score":"28 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Biography, Sport","Review":" You've got to wonder about wrestlers. They're always on the road, they're always carrying knocks and injuries, they don't get paid much (except the few at the absolute top), they get no respect from the public at large, they don't actually compete in the legitimate sense of the word and the vast majority of them are quickly forgotten. Yet nearly all of the wrestlers in Beyond the Mat continue to seek the spotlight. Why? I guess Terry Funk sums it up best It's fun.However, it's a strange type of fun. After all, I'm not sure that most people would class being hit over the head with steel chairs as 'fun'. Nor would most people relish the thought of being thrown off a steel cage. But as the film points out, wrestlers are hardly normal. At the same time, though, they're still people. They have the same problems as all of us. It's just that they earn their living by running around in spandex and by beating the crap out of one another.Of all the different strands in Beyond the Mat, I like the Terry Funk section the most. It just shows how bizarre wrestling is. Here you have a man in his fifties who has degenerative arthritis and who wakes up in the morning, like many old men, in his y-fronts. Yet in the ring he's a bloodthirsty maniac. But at the same time he's a loving father who cries at his daughter's wedding and he has an excellent rapport with the man who he has his most brutal matches with. As dim-witted as wrestling is, nothing out of the ring is simple.And the Funk section illustrates the problem that most wrestler face they can't give up the spotlight. I mean, just take one of Funk's friends, Dennis Stamp. He hasn't wrestled in years but he still trains (by jumping up and down on a trampoline in his underwear) in the vain hope of getting another match. And when he's finally made the referee in Funk's 'retirement' match, he's beside himself with excitement at the prospect of being part of the main event. It seems like when you don't get paid much, when you're forced to do lousy jobs and when no one really knows who you are, the only compensation for such a depressing existence is a few cheers.But although the film touches upon the dark side of wrestling, it's quite touching seeing Funk trying to persuade his friend Stamp to be part of his match. The man may be vicious in the ring, but outside it he's warm-hearted. And I like the way that when he persuades his friend to be part of his match, and when he walks away, he nearly trips over. Despite everything, he's just a lovable old guy. However, I also like the scene because Stamp is such a fool. He's so desperate to be someone and so desperate to be recognised, that he cuts a promo when he's explaining why he can't make the event (I'm not booked!). It's as if reality and wrestling are blurred. He can't tell them apart.Another wrestler who's been messed up by the business is Jake Roberts. He doesn't get on with his daughter and he's forced to pay for his drug habit by wrestling in fourth-rate events in backwater towns. He's even filmed urinating into a bucket and then falling asleep backstage. It really does give a depressing picture of what it is to be a professional wrestler &#150; your existence revolves around the road, run down hotels and small towns. No wonder so many of them are screwed up. But Roberts has even more reason to be screwed up than most. He's the product of a rape and his sister was kidnapped and murdered. And he has a terrible relationship with his father. They can barely look at one another. There's no connection there at all. And it's quite shocking hearing Roberts describe how he gave up his dreams just to shove wrestling down his father's throat (his dad was a wrestler and Robert's resolved to be better than him). Suddenly you can see why Robert's created such a compelling character. He was just drawing on his own life. Again reality and wrestling is blurred.Perhaps the only one in the film that has a decent handle on things is Mick Foley. He has a clear plan (he wants to retire by the age of 35) and he has a solid family to support him. Somehow you know that he's going to be fine. Not that there aren't a few bumps on the way. In one scene he's forced to watch footage of his wife and kids screaming when he's repeatedly hit over the head with a steel chair. It's a real wake-up call. I mean, as entertaining as it is for sadistic bastards like myself, you just can't make you family endure that time after time. But it's his family that will keep Foley on the straight and narrow. However, for the other wrestlers who don't have stable personal lives, they'll have to seek love in cheers and applause. It seems like wrestling is a drug that most wrestlers can't crack.Not that a few don't try. There's an amusing scene when a wrestler called New Jack, who has four justifiable homicides, auditions for a Hollywood casting agent. The people there are slimy beyond belief. They make the carnies in wrestling look honest in comparison.But why the film succeeds so emphatically is because everything is just presented as it is. No judgements are made and nobody is looked down upon. Yeah, wrestling may be something on the fringes of society, but the film shows that as weird as it is, the people aren't really that weird after all. They're just people with the same problems we all have.

Blaustien does an amazing job and it was no surprise that it was seriously being considered for an Academy Award nomination (sadly it never ended up being actually nominated).Wrestling fans have had to defend their love of the art of pro wrestling for many years. When the topic would come up that I am a wrestling fan I would be faced with the same idiotic question, with a tone of disbelief in their voice, You know it's fake, right?. My response has always been to follow that question with And what is your favourite TV show? I usually get an answer like Friends or something similar and I then mockingly explain to them that Rachel and Ross never dated and Monica and Chandler are not really married and that that isn't even their real names. Soon they began to see the stupidity of their proclaiming that wrestling is fake. Whew, sorry, kind of went on a rant there.Blaustien's film allows non wrestling fans to see exactly how fake wrestling can be. The blood, sweat and hard work that these athletes and their families endure is vividly shown. We finally see a human side of the often larger than life characters that these men and women of the squared circle portray.One thing that I found very profound was the drab, dark and gloomy colours Blaustein used in segments showing that human side as opposed to the colourfulness of the slick production of the athletes performing. We go from the glamorous pyro and bright lights of a live Pay per View event to shots of the wrestlers in their concrete, black and white, dirty and sweaty dressing rooms. I don't know if the director did this on purpose but I thought it was quite effective.Bottom line this movie is a must for any fan of wrestling but I feel it is even more important to the non-wrestling fan interested to see why all these people watch this fake form of entertainment.

But to be honest it was quite disturbing at times.In a way it can shatter a fans illusions. We fans seem to think of wrestlers as superhuman beings-we forget that they have personal needs, families, wives, girlfriends, children etc. This movie shows us how wrestlers lives can be changed due to their devotion to keeping the fans entertained.I won't spoil any of the film but one example is Jake The Snake Roberts. I watched Jake wrestle in the WWF from 1986-1992 and to me he was a brilliant wrestler who had it all-how wrong I was. It showed us another side to Jake Roberts-the human side who has sacrificed a lot to become a wrestler, including family.This is a thought provoking movie which helps remind us that wrestlers are human after all and that they spend a lot of time away from their loved ones putting their bodies on the line purely to keep us entertained. If anything, this movie helps us appreciate the wrestlers even more.

Perhaps no other spectacle involves personalities as much as professional wrestling and Barry Blaustein's insightful Beyond the Mat' explores those who thrill us with their lust for mayhem.  Men and women with self destructive appetites are drawn into this entertainment venue - those who make a profit like the billionaire promoter Vince McMahon are called smart and shrewd, those who are swallowed up by their maladaptive behavior like the pathetic Jake'the Snake' Roberts are simply called mad.  Beyond the Mat doesn't uncover anything we don't already know - the loud-mouth, hyped interviews, the staged choreography of flying bodies and colliding men against steel, and the spurting blood sacrificed in the name of violence.  What we do see are the showmen who strut their stuff inside the ring, more dedicated to their brotherhood and craft than you can imagine.  The battle wearied Terry Funk is a throwback to the self-managed, up-close-and-personal hero that Blaustein and a good number of his generation grew up with.  The much younger Mick 'Mankind' Foley is a creation of the media driven World Wrestling Federation, a syndication leap years away from the Amarillo, Texas of Terry Funk.  The deeply hurting Jake the Snake has fought so many battles in his long and troubled life that his only solace is crack cocaine and fighting in the ring.  But the blood that Funk and Mick and Jake spill is the same blood of wanton brutality.  It is the spectacle of harm and harming others.  And yet in a cruel and twisted way, Beyond the Mat reminds us that wrestlers are as normal as anyone, just different.  'Mankind' and 'The Rock' can talk pleasantries before a match,  before each tries to pulverize the other in front of their stunned wives and children.  Terry Funk, as a gesture of forgiveness, repeatedly begs an old nemesis to referee his supposedly final match - a match in which he knows he will lose and will get brains bashed in.  Beyond the Mat' is a well made chronicle of wrestlers who care less if they win or lose (the promoters see to that) but more on how they play the game.

Thinking I'd be seeing nothing more than an overview of pro wrestling, I was pleasantly surprised to see this documentary by filmmaker Blaustein that incorporates all the major wrestling organizations in the U.S. and also some of the greatest wrestlers ever to step in the ring...including a few personal favorites like Mick Foley and Terry Funk.  In showing these wrestlers as humans, Blaustein has created a view of wrestling unique in a world of trickery and promotional stunts.  This is one helluva documentary going behind the scenes of all the wrestling promotions, showing the real people involved, and in the end shows the viewer that, indeed, in wrestling nothing as it seems.  A few of the highlights include a touching, and tragic, portrayal of mat legend Jake The Snake Roberts, behind the scenes of a WWF pay-per-view, and the story of hardcore legend Mick Foley.  I would highly recommend this to anyone...it is an entertaining and revealing film that I think even non-wrestling fans would enjoy.

If you can watch the scenes where Foley is repeatedly hit in the head in front of his wife with a chair and then try and talk about how fake the sport is. Look at the life of Jake Roberts and say that there isn't something inherently messed up. Though it depicts horrible acts of violence and drug use, but this movie is more shocking in the damage people in this sport do to themselves in pursuit of this fake sport with so little respect for themselves.

I can still remember a long time ago on Sundays watching Wrestling at the Chase with Larry Madisick (The ringside announcer). Then, it was Crusher Blackewell, The Von-Eriks, and other various names that seem to have long been forgotten. Now, it's Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and women wrestlers like Chyna.     It was amazing to see the transformation from what it was into what it is. It was also sad to see the self destruction of Jake the Snake Roberts and to a certain point Terry Funk with his refusal to retire.     What was also interesting was the fact that the heads of the wrestling groups (like Vince McMahon)the movie did profile did not make light of what they did or even how they promoted it. This is sports entertainment plain and simple. They have tapped into a market not to be out done by any other mass marketed item except for PokeMon.     The only problem I had with this film was the fact that I did see it at the movie theater. Now after the fact, I believe that a documentary like this should have gone to video instead. It didn't diminish the quality of the subject, but it was just something not meant for the big screen.     None the less I did enjoy this film and I would recommend it for just about anyone who has the slightest interest in wrestling.

Director Barry Blaustein spent three years travelling up and down the highways of America in an attempt to find out what the wrestling business is really about. The end result was the compelling and controversial Beyond the Mat.Even six years after it's release, Beyond the Mat makes compelling viewing, even if it's just to see how the lives and careers of those documented in the film have progressed. For some, a great deal has changed, while for others, time has more or less stood still.For me, the three main focuses of the film were Mick Foley, Terry Funk, and Jake Roberts. The scenes with Mick spending time with his wife and children were particularly compelling, especially for those people who were only familiar with his sadistic in-ring characters, Cactus Jack and Dude Love. As Blaustein himself comments, Mick Foley is probably the sanest man in the history of professional wrestling. But the scenes during his Royal Rumble match with The Rock, where his kids are in tears and his wife has to take them away from the action are both compelling and distressing at the same time.Then we have the legend that is Terry Funk, as he helps launch Extreme Championship Wrestling onto a national stage with the company's first pay-per-view, Barely Legal, before moving onto his retirement, an emotional moment as he lost his final match to Bret Hart.Then there's Jake The Snake Roberts, Blaustein's most vocal critic in what are possibly the most controversial segments of the film. Jake's story is a tragic one, of his battles with drug addiction, and of his strained relationships with his father and daughter. While watching the tearful reunion with his daughter, you get the feeling that Jake isn't being entirely truthful with himself, and that this scene would have been better played out in private.But as I mentioned at the beginning of this piece, it's interesting to see where some of the film's main players are now, six years later.Mike Modest, who received a WWF try-out during the film, is still wrestling, having achieved a great deal of success with Pro Wrestling NOAH in Japan.Shortly before the film was released, Darren Drozdov was paralysed after an in-ring accident. Droz continues to make progress today, but is still confined to a wheelchair.ECW signed a national television contract with TNN during the making of the film, Two years later, the company went bankrupt.Terry Funk's retirement was, like his many other retirements, short-lived, and he continues to compete to this day, at the age of 61.Jake Roberts continues to battle his personal demons. Having fallen foul of the law while living and working in Britain, Jake returned to America this year, appeared on Monday Night War, and signed a merchandise deal with WWE. Rumour has it that Vince McMahon is personally paying for Jake's rehab treatment. In a shoot interview with Rob Feinstein five years ago, Jake said he would be taking legal action against Blaustein because of his portrayal in the film, but nothing ever came of this. Jake has been extremely critical of the director in numerous interviews he has given since the film's release.In conclusion, Beyond the Mat is indeed compelling viewing, and one of the best wrestling documentaries ever made, on a par with Wrestling with Shadows. Barry Blaustein did a hell of a job portraying the wrestling business in a positive light. It's a hell of a film, and one that any wrestling fan should make a permanent part of their collection.

In one famous scene, Mick Foley's family watching ring side is nearly put into tears after seeing their father and husband be beaten up by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson at a WWE PPV 'Royal Rumble'. Mick can't see that the abuse he takes on his body is hurting his family. Another wrestler focus on is Terry Funk whom can't find himself retiring even with him being 53 years old at the time of shooting and past his prime. Terry Funk represent the man who would die in the ring, rather than quit the business. A Randy 'The Ram' Robinson like personality whom just looking for the next big comeback. Lastly, the film focus on a wrestler who is at his rock bottom. Jake 'The Snake' Roberts whom popularity height reach in the 1980's is now in the late 1990's a crack cocaine addict that estranged from everybody he call family. His daughter wants no part of him, and his father doesn't want to speak to him. Yes, there will be short knit bits of other wrestlers in the film, such as short lived career puking Darren Drozdov, the movie star dreaming New Jack, and two wrestlers Tony Jones and Michael Modest trying to get a try out. The director spent three years endeavoring to understand the mindset of someone who would voluntarily choose to become a professional wrestler. Blaustein interviews a wide variety of wrestling personalities and ascertains their motivations. What the movie lacks is interviews with the big time wrestlers of the time, Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, and The Rock. It would be nice to see what their take on the business is. Another problem with the film is while they were able to film both in Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Federeration, I felt that when World Championship Wrestling refused to participate in the film, it really made the film missing opinions of those wrestlers. The interview questions could have been more driven to talking about more serious key issues dealing with pro-wrestling such as steroids, wrestling union, and the sense of faking- violence. There are a couple of laughs in the movie, but the overall effect is much more depressing than it is humorous. The self-mutilations in the movie might be hard to watch for non-wrestling fans.

Yes, it's pre-determined and choreographed, but you still need to be charismatic and athletic, and night after night these guys put their bodies on the line just for our entertainment. People have been killed and paralyzed doing this, so to anyone who says it's not real and takes no skill, I point to this documentary. Beyond The Mat looks into the lives of these guys outside the ring and show the ancient Terry Funk, whose body has been ravaged from years in the ring. He can barely walk anymore, but still has to get in there and has to do this because it's all he knows and what he loves. Jake The Snake Roberts is also featured and he talks about how eight years on the road with WWE and how it made him a neglectful father, a bad husband, and a drug addict. Roberts says between the pain and the constant moving around he could never have done it without drugs! Finally, they look at Mick Foley AKA Mankind, Dude Love, Cactus Jack and show how he's this normal family man and while his family knows it's for show, how much they worry. In the last 30 years, hundreds of pro-wrestlers have died under the age of 45, most of them due to the physical trauma they've put their bodies through or the dependence on drugs that has resulted from it. If those were NFL or MLB stars instead, there would be massive reform and congressional intervention, but the truth is no one cares about these guys, except of course their families, friends, and fans. Beyond The Mat is important because it shows just what these guys put on the line and just how little the people at the top care.

I guess we can only pray he has gotten better over time.Then Terry Funk, a lovable old man who doesn't know when to stop and is determined to make were he can't walk before he really retires, even though his family watches in horror every time.And Mick Foley, a really likable person and great father. We get to see him push it all to the extreme in one of the most violent matches in WWF history and then say I think we really touched some people with this. Some will say it was too violent but I think we really touched some people.

No, sport is a going against someone for victory. The victory here is planned before.Is it like football, people just playing for the love? Showcasing their athletic ability? No, look at what Vince said about Jake the Snake. He didn't have hardly any ability but he had stunning presence. And the same goes for Hulk Hogan. His two famous moves are a drop kick that my grandma could do just as good and the body slam, which everyone does. He became the most popular ever because of his presence, not ability.At best wrestling is entertainment with some athletic display. It should really be call a stunt show or something.Even though the filmmaker, a fan who wanted to make us fans made me anything but one. He did show it to me without hiding behind anything.

In the home video version, Blaustein frames the movie in a re-enacted view of himself as a young boy, when he first began to watch wrestling and was shocked to discover that these big, scary men actually had families outside the ring, and then he focuses the documentary on three wrestlers in particular Terry Funk, Mick Foley, and Jake the Snake Roberts.  Terry Funk represents the old guard aging wrestlers who continue to wrestle, retire, and then wrestle again despite their deteriorating bodies (his knees are so bad, he can hardly walk); Mick Foley represents the current young wrestling star, and he is shown as he tries to spend as much time as possible with his beloved family against the demands of his WWF career; and finally, wrestler Jake the Snake Roberts shows how the constantly on-the-road lifestyle of being a celebrity wrestler can gradually seduce and destroy a man, as he is now a drug addict who is permanently estranged from his own family.  Although I would've liked a short intro at the beginning of the film on how professional wrestling developed from its early days into the campy spectacle we're familiar with today, this is still a very engaging film that will humanize these men who play act with pain.

The wrestlers of my youth were overweight washed up ex-athletes with no finesse, little fanfare and even less skill who plied their trade in dingy little gyms in front of small crowds.  Wrestling was far from mainstream - you would never find it on respectable tv stations - and it was treated with derision at best.  Oh how far we've come.  Today, wrestling matches sell out stadiums and are featured in primetime on the major networks.  The wrestlers are generally in amazing shape, make six figure salaries, are adored/despised by millions, they run a flashier game and both celebrities and professional athletes alike have participated in the fun.  The typical match is an absurd male soap opera complete with surgically enhanced debutantes, chock full of bravado, angst, and filled with aerial acrobatics that would put most stuntmen to shame.***    Warning  there are some potential spoilers ahead    ***The debate as to whether or not it is fake has long been put to rest, by of all people, the promoters themselves, who freely admit that the matches are choreographed  - professional wrestling is now billed as sports entertainment and not a sport.  That doesn't mean however that there aren't casualties - for example, you can't simulate hitting someone with a chair - the secret is learning how to absorb the blow without being seriously injured (try to take it on the back or shoulders).  Still no matter how much you prepare, things can and do go wrong - Stone Cold Steve Austin was almost paralyzed recently when his head was driven into the mat, and Owen Hart was killed when his harness came undone as he was being lowered into the ring. Barry Blaustein's quasi-documentary focuses on three men who exemplify different stages in the evolution of the sport.  Terry Funk is a fifty-something old school fighter who can't bring himself to retire even though his knees are literally falling apart.  Jake The Snake Roberts, is the dysfunctional one-time superstar, who had the world at his feet and now wrestles in out of the way dives and looks to a crack pipe for solace.  And finally there is Mick Foley, the masochistic madman who subjects himself to extreme pain to please his fans. Although the movie isn't a hard-hitting exposé - Vince McMahon surely wouldn't have participated otherwise - it does reveal a seldom seen side of the wrestling world where dreams are dashed, and people are destroyed.  You will feel like a voyeur as Roberts details the demons in his life, breaks down when he meets the daughter he hasn't seen in four years, and spends an agonizingly silent afternoon with a distant father he has spent a life trying to please.  A casualty of his success, you wonder how many other Roberts there are. In a recent A&E Biography featuring Foley, they interviewed The Undertaker.  He revealed that it was Foley's idea to be thrown from the top of the cage to a table twenty feet below in a now infamous match.  He protested, fearing that Foley would be killed, but Foley relented, and was subsequently knocked unconscious in two separate falls.  Not surprisingly, these antics have upset his family on more than one occasion.  One such incident provides the setting for the most emotional moment in the film.Foley is watching a tape of his latest match, in which he is beaten bloody with a chair.  The camera then pans to his family, sitting at ringside, who are screaming and crying uncontrollably.  An articulate, humble man, and devoted father, he is stunned.  His voice quavers and he says (I'm paraphrasing here)  Oh my god.  What kind of father would put his children through something like that?  Surely, this epiphany led him to turn his back on the wrestling world.Even if you abhor wrestling, better yet, especially if you do, you will find this to be an interesting and well done film.

Wrestling for me was just a fun evening of cathartic violence, as my sweetie likes to put it. I always felt distanced from it because I didn't understand it much past the showmanship aspect. Barry Blaustein has been a wrestling fan since he was 8 years old.  Thirty years later (and a few movie screenplays under his belt - Boomerang, Coming to America and The Nutty Professor to name a couple), he takes a low res video camera and three years on the road researching into the lives of Mick (Mankind) Foley, Jake (The Snake) Roberts and Terry Funk, each at a crossroads in their lives.  Mankind at the pinnacle of his career, Jake The Snake trying to get out of the gutter, past the sad and tragic life he now regrets living and Terry Funk, winding down his career. Each with their own gifts, and their own problems.  We are taken back into the bowels of the wrestling world. Back to the beginning by way of APW's (Indy Wrestling) School for Professional Wrestlers and how they aspire to swim with the big fish at the WWF. We are led behind the scenes at the headquarters of WWF,  and their decision makers as they make (and break) careers. We sneak backstage and watch, wide-eyed,  at the beautiful choreography that is wrestling and see, without a doubt, that it is not for the squeamish, nor the unfit. We also realize there is some extreme pain to experience, both physically, emotionally and mentally, as we see through the eyes of  professional wrestlers and the life that they have chosen to live. For a brief moment, I was very moved by the sheer intensity of it all. And I left the theatre with a very healthy respect for the men and women who choose to call this their career, no, more than a career.  For some it's their entire lives.  For wrestling fans, this is a must see.  And for non-wrestling fans, it is very eyeopening and interesting.

And we see the underbelly of wrestling through Roberts, as he travels from independent show to independent show and visits a daughter he hasn't seen in years.  Roberts' story resonates most, because his tale is the most extreme of the three.We also see wrestlers trying to make it, and a wrestler beginning his career in the WWF with the apt name of Puke.

Beyond The Mat takes a specific content only recognizable to fans and specialists in their fields, and turns said specific content into something any average Joe can gain an instantaneous interest into the presented subject matter.  Beyond The Mat is a documentary in the purest sense of the word.  The director takes the camera where it doesn't belong.  He exposes that which is unexplicably mythological as smoke and mirrors, nothing more.  Best of all, and most important to the success of a documentary in the eyes of an audience, it allows us a glimpse of what makes us only human.  The drama, humor, and tragedy (not to mention the embarassment we feel for the referee of Terry Funk's final bout) are all elements that make for a successful documentary... a display of humanity at its best and worst.  Yep,  Hoop Dreams, When We Were Kings, Roger and Me, Crumb, Paradise Lost, and Beyond The Mat.  All films that remind us of just how normal we are, regardless of the extraordinary situations we're sometimes mooshed into.  Do you give hell about boxing, basketball, cars, comics, murderers, or wrestling?  Maybe, maybe not.  But it's documentaries like these that grab you and make you see the subject matter in another light.  And that's what a succesful documentary SHOULD do.  AND that's why Beyond the Mat is a successful documentary.  See it.

To that I might state that only an old wrestler is sadder. After all, wrestling is not a true sport- it's a violent theatrical production, and there is not much at stake for the viewers. As for the wrestlers, themselves&#133;.that's where this documentary from 2000 comes in. Directed by first time auteur Barry Blaustein it chronicles the re-rise of pro wrestling to prominence in the late 1990s- the era that saw Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and Cactus Jack become celebrities of a greater nature than any of their forebears, like Killer Kowalski, Dusty Rhodes, Bruno Sammartino, or Hulk Hogan. The film starts off as an exploration of the men behind the 'names', yet it makes a mistake right off the bat, by billing itself as an exposé of the sport, a film that 'Vince McMahon doesn't want you to see'. McMahon, to those in the know, is the owner of the largest wrestling league in the nation- the WWE, then the WWF, but there's little in the film to suggest that this is a tell-all. There are some wrestlers with gripes, and we see tales of failed lives, and failed wrestling circuits, like the ECW and WCW (long since bought out by the WWE), and McMahon's league certainly has a history of dealing in drugs (steroids, etc.- as the aforementioned Hogan testified against him in a highly publicized trial in the early 90s), as well as being shamefully anti-union, and not caring of its performers (not long after the film's release one of its wrestlers- Owen Hart, of a well-known wrestling clan- was killed in a spectacular fashion while performing, and the film acknowledges that one of its minor characters, Droz, was paralyzed not long after the film was completed), but all of this is public knowledge, and old news.What works, though is the portrait of the biz the film portrays, and the three main wrestlers whose lives it follows&#133;. The film has its moments of poignancy and insight, but they are too few and far between. A more pristine and jaded eye would have been necessary, and a more ballsy approach to the subject matter, to gain a following outside the 'choir' of pro wrestling. Still, since I go to those pews, every few years, I think it's a must see for any wrestling fan. The game has changed much during the decades, yet, in a sense, it hasn't changed at all. Whether good or bad is the crux, and what this film passes on.

It focuses on three Hall of Fame Wrestlers (in my book) Mick Foley, Terry Funk and Jake The Snake. It also shows scenes of up and coming wrestlers like the people's champ The Rock.This movie is one of the best documentaries on wrestling next toBrett Hart Wrestling with Shadows and the biography on Owen Hart both available through A&E home video.The movie shows what sacrifices and punishment these guys go through to put a show for us wrestling fans. We see Mick Foley get hit hard with a chair from the Rock when he was a bad guy while his kids and wife look on. His wife is in tears as she sees her husband take a beating.Anyone who says that wrestling is fake, should try out for the WWF and see how fake it really is. After only a couple of minutes getting backdropped, slammed and hit with a chair by these guys , I am sure you'll see it's not fake,as Hulk Hogan says its choreographed.The biggest controversy of the movie is when Vince McMahon, corporate mogul and CEO of the WWF, decided to have this movie pulled off during commercials of the WWF and to ultimately turn his back on the whole project. Thereby making this film an Independent Film since it would no longer receive any help from the WWF.Nevertheless, Vince, makes several cameos in this movie, trying not to look like the greedy pig he really is.The timing of this movie is ironic, only a couple of months before this movie came out,Brett Hart would get screwed in his final match in Canada with Shawn Michaels, then in late May his brother Owen would die in a freak accident where he would fall to his death in front of a capacity crowd in a WWF pay per view event (that footage was edited out of the event).Recently (November 2000), the Hart family made a settlement with the WWF for a whopping $18 million dollars for the lawsuit the Hart's filed against the WWF. The Hart's say they will use some of the money for charity. I can just see the smile on Vince McMahon's face go down right now -) . Now On to the review.The film is excellent and is a must see for all you WWF fans. It is already out on DVD with extra footage not seen in theaters. EBAY currently has several auctions for it starting at $10-20.A bargain for a really emotional,entertaining film.The Director, Barry Blaustein, who did some of the writing for the Nutty Professor, has shown here that he can do drama as well as comedy.If you're kid is foolish enough of thinking of getting into wrestling, you might want to show him this film, it will definitely change their mind.Which is the other theme of this movie, Wrestling is definitely something that is done by professionals.Kids don't try this at home "},{"Title":"I ain't a forty-hour motherf*cker, man.","Date":"25 November 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Biography, Sport","Review":" I lived outside Amarillo, Texas for nine years and never saw Terry Funk wrestle.

You see that they are actually men who have families that care about them very much. While Beyond the Mat is good, I would have to say that it is not the best wrestling movie ever made.

Wrestlers even Mick Foley who has been fairly honest in breaking character still protects the business even Jesse Ventura didn't break any new ground. Ventura could have said a lot about McMahon that was negative after all he sued McMahon over royalties and Venture was never known for keeping his mouth shut he was the wrestler who wanted to start a union in wrestling until Hulk Hogan ratted him out to Vince McMahonHad Blaustein gone in with the attitude that he was going to expose all of the underbelly of pro wrestling both Vince McMahon and the wrestlers would have handed this guy his butt. Most of the important issues in pro wrestling today like drug related deaths, the need for a union in the business. Both industry and the wrestlers are in denial about and will not address those issues in a serious way. Also Blaustein is an admitted fan and just wants to show wrestlers as being human rather then the characters we see on TV each week. Blaustein's choices are interesting Terry Funk is the old guy who just can't give it up Funk in many ways is a sad case heres a guy that can't stay away from the roar of the crowd. No matter how broken down he is as long as he can still get in the ring he will be thereJake The Snake Roberts is an interesting study and most likely could have been a movie itself. Roberts comes off as a needy self serving person who tries to use emotion to try and gain whatever he thinks can be gained from his daughter. But it is a work after seeing her he goes out and does Crack Cocaine.

I often find it odd that people who claim not to be fans of the sport are the main ones to be shocked when a certain wrestler doesn't win the match.  But anyway, BEYOND THE MAT looks behind the scenes of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and some of the independent shows.  We get to see Darren Drozdov, who was going to originally be called Puke, but went on to simply be called Droz.  He is currently going through rehab to overcome paralysis due to injuries suffered in a match against D-Lo Brown.  We get to see two rookies called up from a wrestling school to compete in a WWF match.  We get a little glimpse of Chyna as she's getting a manicure and a pedicure (I half expected her to bust out sing I Feel Pretty from WEST SIDE STORY).  Then, we get the meat of the film as we get a glimpse of three icons of the mat sport.      First is Terry Funk.  Fifty-three years old and STILL competing in the hardcore ECW, where the only weapon not allowed is a gun.  His doctor is amazed that he's still wrestling despite practically not having a knee.  Next is Jake The Snake Roberts, a former WWF/WCW (World Championship Wrestling, one of the few federations who didn't give the filmmakers consent to film).  We see old footage of a slim Roberts competing in WRESTLEMANIA III (in front of a record 79,000 fans) compared to the current, bloated, crack-addicted Roberts wrestling in front of a mere 200.  We also see his sad reunion with a daughter that he hasn't seen in over three years.  Then, there's Mick Foley . . .      An even bigger hardcore icon than Funk, Foley has competed in the big three federations and had three gimmicks going at once in the WWF (Mankind/Dude Love/Cactus Jack Manson).  We see him telling his wife and children that he isn't going to get hurt too badly in the match.  Their reaction to seeing him getting beaten to within an inch of his life is heart-rending.  I just wish that there had been some things shown about the tragedies that befell the Von Erich and Hart families.  That would have made a very poignant ending.

What we do learn is Blaustein really likes wrestling and it shows in his this one-sided perspective. Fodder for WWF fans and the like.

This guy has wrestled for years and has been injured before.  The filmmaker made it look like it was the first time she's ever seen it and that felt unnatural.Also, the entire piece was shot on video.  I wish distributors were forced to state that a film release was originally shot in low-res video (at least Blair Witch made that clear). One day everything we'll see in the theater will have been shot in hi-res video, but we're not there yet.

Why should we?","Date":"30 November 2001","Score":"0 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Biography, Sport","Review":"  The narrator (a screenwriter, complete with polished, insincere one-liners) tells us that professional wrestling is less fake than we think.  Yes, the fights are rigged, he says, but the blood and pain are real.Terrific.  Unreal contests with real violence - how perverted can you get?  I'd much rather watch real contests with unreal violence.  How could anyone prefer the converse?This question is never answered.  Nor are we given any other interesting information; the documentary is just an excuse to pry into the private lives of the wrestlers.  I don't care about the private lives of the wrestlers.  And I don't have much time for screen documentaries, as a rule.  At best they're a source of limited information for people too lazy to read; at worst they provide a disguised form of base titillation for anyone who lacks or doesn't want to exercise the imaginative capacity to form an interest in the lives of fictional characters (who, unlike real people, have no right to privacy).This is the at worst.  It should be fun for anyone who enjoys looking at human degradation and doesn't want to learn anything about or from it. "}]
