Silly, simple, stupid and ABSOLUTELY pointless. But hey, it IS a slapstick comedy, and a ******* GREAT ONE! MUCH better than the first movie! In EVERY SECOND of the movie there is a gag, a joke, or someone or something that is so damn funny that I can't help myself from falling of the chair laughing like hell! I think I've seen this movie over 20 times, It's still the funniest movie ever for me. I guess when it comes to movies of this kind, I just want them to be as stupid, with as many jokes per minute, as possible. I think Charlie Sheen is perfect for this role, he does look serious, like some kind of a bad Rambo-wannabe, and a serious-looking person doing stupid things is always great. It's also great that Richard Crenna plays almost the same character as in Rambo 3, with many of his lines unchanged. If you've watched the Rambo-movies, (most important the third one), you'll get more of the gags and the dialogs, especially in the scenes from the Buddhist temple. Saddam Hussein is also excellent, he looks really like the real one! If you like stupid and crazy movies...WATCH THIS! "},{"Title":"Damn funny!!

But for the fans of that one, and I'm one of them, this movie promised to offer a lot more pleasure and laughter. What has always appealed to me is the fact that they try to make fun of so many other movies. This time they have re-used parts from movies like Rambo, Apocalypse Now, Terminator, The Lady and the Tramp... Trying to find all those references is already a big part of the fun, especially when you already know most of those movies.In Hot Shots! Part Deux Topper Harley has retired again, now living in a Buddhist monastery. But again he is asked by the CIA to lead a special operation into Iraq. He will lead a rescue mission who has to rescue the last rescue team, who went in to rescue the last rescue team who were sent to rescue some prisoners left behind after Desert Storm. While saving them, he will meet again with his beloved Ramada and will shoot a couple millions of Iraqui soldiers...Even though this movie wasn't as strong as the first one, I must say that I still had a good time with it. Not every part worked very well, but scenes like the one with the chicken shot out of a bow or the 'I loved you in Wall Street' scene are just hilarious. But one of the best parts must have been the one in which they said that the critics wouldn't like it, because this was just a weak copy of the first one in order to make more money. That was so spot on that I couldn't help smiling about it.About the acting I can be quite brief. It's completely over the top, but what else can you expect from a movie like this one? This is a parody and some normal acting would never be able to put the emphasis on the already absurd situations. It's sometimes a bit too much, but I know that it's necessary for the movie and that's why I still appreciate it.In the end this is an absurd comedy and parody on many kinds of movies. If you like this kind of humor and know most of the other movies, then you'll probably have a great time with it. I sure liked it and that's why I give it a 7/10.

PART DEUX was released American comedy cinema has been in a steep decline. Part of the reason for this is that HOT SHOTS! PART DEUX is an Everest of film-making that has yet to been scaled since. And once you reach the peak the only way is down. HOT SHOTS! PART DEUX has everything. It is the most consistently side-splittingly funny film since Chaplin and Keaton at their peak. It is the most devastating and uplifting story of love, war and sacrifice since CASABLANCA and it has rip-roaring action scenes (Die! Energizer! Bunny! Die!) on par with the mighty movies it is (lovingly) parodying. Charlie Sheen, despite his off-screen propensities, has always been an agreeable screen presence and here he delivers his performances for the ages. Valeria Golino is a goddess for all the ages and also displays impeccable comedic skills. She also kicks a considerable amount of butt without ever losing her grace and femininity. This is quite possibly the last great American female role with substance to it and sadly none have close since.When people consider the great sequels of all time, usually they pick THE GODFATHER PART II. Then I think to myself - Why pick the three-hour plus GODFATHER PART II when a hundred times more out of the 90 minute HOT SHOTS PART DEUX? Does THE GODFATHER PART II have Al Pacino using a chicken as an arrow? No! So when you are looking at your shiny DVD collection and thinking I think I'll watch a GODFATHER movie my advise is to pick up HOT SHOTS PART DEUX and watch it... twice. The only way this film could be any better is if Miguel Ferrer had more screen time. That guy is a Plato of modern times. War. It's fantastic! Even Rowan Atkinson is funny in this film. Let's see Ingmar Bergman pull that feat off!

Charlie Sheen is an absolute blast to watch, this time, they are taking on Rambo, Predator, Commando, Basic Instinct, and many other references.Topper is asked to come back to save a bunch of American soldiers captured by Saddam Husain, but he has been dumped by Ramada and starts a steamy affair with a CIA agent who gives him her mole for luck. When he sees Ramada on the mission due to sequel casting, they stick together and the team puts in their best and saves the soldiers from the wacky dictator.Hot Shots Part Deux is a lot of fun for certain people, like me, who enjoy these zany goof ball comedies.

That doesn't really matter. The opening sequence in which Richard Crenna induces Martin Sheen to come out of retirement in a Harikrishna ashram is a little dull, but after that it's solid laughs.Most of the jokes are silly and played in perfect deadpan. Example an overly bemuscled Sheen, dressed in macho commando gear, steps off a helicopter at a remote jungle camp, accompanied by Brenda Bakke, a gorgeous long-haired woman in tight shorts who oozes sex from every pore. Miguel Ferrer, the camp commander, marches up to the two of them and demands to know, in his official voice, Which of you is Michelle Huddleston? Later a man is killed by a chicken shot from a bow.There are so many gags packed into some scenes that it takes repeated viewings to notice them. During an intense combat scene, Sheen and Ferrer hide behind some packing crates and Ferrer begins to sob because he's lost his taste for killing. Sheen comforts him as you might comfort a child Hey, buddy boy, we're all entitled to a few mistakes. The exchange itself is quite funny, an insertion of pop psychology crap into a scene full of whizzing bullets and exploding mortar shells. But behind the pair, we can notice that one of the supply boxes is labeled Spineless Jellyfish and another Yellowbellies. I think I'll quit with one more example, worthy of Woody Allan. Two bitchy women who used to be roommates are exchanging insults. One says I'll never forget what you wrote in my yearbook. 'Remember all the fun we had in speech class? And I'll **** up your life if it's the last thing I do'. None of the performances flop. How COULD they? You could drag some wino in off the street and have him stumbling around and retching these lines and he'd be funny. That said, I must admit that I enjoyed Loyd Bridge's performance the most. He's still the same character he was in Hot Shots, a bionic man, but this time around he's the president and he really gets into the part. Looks like this time the other hand is on the wrong foot. Well I don't want to get into what there is of a plot, and I don't want to give away any more of the gags. That leaves me pretty much with nothing more to say.You'd need to be in the throes of a major affective disorder not to laugh out loud during this one. "},{"Title":"precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys","Date":"25 November 2009","Score":"8 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as Hot Shots! Part Deux. Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first Hot Shots! was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds.Like its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of Top Gun but made references to dozens of other movies from Dances With Wolves to Gone with the Wind. Likewise, the sequel is a parody of Rambo III, but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in Rambo III, Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country.Now this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of Rambo III, but I spotted parodies of Casablanca, Platoon (which also starred Charlie Sheen), Lady and the Tramp, The Wizard of Oz, Terminator 2 and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody Star Wars, sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is The Behn Gazaarah as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)! Hot Shots! Part Deux opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from Lady and the Tramp, it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of Casablanca. It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner.And if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first Hot Shots! Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas Tug Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience.In closing, Hot Shots! Part Deux is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.

Part Deux beats the odds to be pretty good, not just as spoofs go, but as spoof *sequels* go. Granted, it's not always very funny, but enough of the verbal and visual jokes work to make this solidly entertaining comedy fare, and a worthy sequel to the hilarious first movie. It goes about making fun of the corpse littered action escapism films of the 1980s, which of course were a genre just ripe for parody. Charlie Sheen returns as hero Topper Harley, now living in Thailand after getting his heart broken by Ramada (Valeria Golino). He's approached by the CIA to undertake a top secret mission in the Middle East where he must rescue the rescue team who went in to save the rescue team who tried to retrieve some hostages.Also returning from the first film are Lloyd Bridges, who once again is an absolute riot; somehow, his idiotic character Thomas Tug Benson has become the President of the United States. Jerry Haleva makes an encore appearance as Saddam Hussein, and gets more to do this time, including a climactic duel with Benson. New characters include those played by lovely Brenda Bakke, Richard Crenna (who gets to poke fun at his own Rambo series role), Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Mitch Ryan, Ryan Stiles, Gregory Sierra, Andreas Katsulas, and Clyde Kusatsu. So there's a lot of familiar faces here, including some other famous faces in gag cameos. (The best one is by Sheen's dad Martin.) One of the brightest jokes is the bloodiest movie ever one; among the movies and shows parodied are Basic Instinct, No Way Out, Lady and the Tramp, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, and Bridges' own series 'Sea Hunt', but mostly co-writer and director Jim Abrahams, an old hand at this sort of thing, keeps his focus on skewering the mindless macho action flick.Overall, this is a very enjoyable comedy, no matter if some of the humour is dated (such as referring to then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton).

Maybe something will motivate him... like Crenna playing the same role he did in the First Blood series.With the new military-themed blockbuster ripe for parodying chosen(one with a grander scope, as it should be), a cast of new and old faces alike all game, this sequel does a lot to live up to its predecessor. Like the franchises of Naked Gun and Airplane!, this works in part because so much of it is played straight. One element in a scene or bit will be off, but usually only that, so that it contrasts against the real backdrop.The pop culture references, gags and jokes are plentiful, with a gradual rise towards the climax. We get to breathe, and it doesn't rush so that anything really goes completely unnoticed. Rarely does something fall flat. The material is both visual and verbal, with cleverness, silly stuff, plays on words, etc. Roles are well-cast, and no one is really given too much or little screen-time or laughs.This is Abrahams before these got excessive - in spite of the drop in/out nature of the hilarious antics, they never feel disjointed, and there is a clear whole... one with a defined plot, I might add, another thing some more recent entries in the genre have gotten wrong. FX and stunts look and feel real, thus successfully convincing us that we really *are* watching a big-budget action flick - just one where a lot goes wrong, strange things are said and done, etc.There is a lot of violence, some sexuality(both comically over the top) and a little strong language in this.

The real standout again though is the late Lloyd Bridges (RIP) who does an exceptional and funny job as President Benson. The duel at the end of the film involving Benson is a funny climax.

A great villain who has some of the best jokes, one consisting a vacuum in bed. But the wacky and out of no where jokes is what keeps this laugh train going. From the start with a spelling typo in the opening to a lightsabre fight between the President of the United States and Saddam Hussein, the jokes are fired at the viewer. They should have a warning stating that you could wet your pants from watching this masterpiece. This film spoofs all war classics starting from Rambo all the way to Apocalypse Now. If you enjoy the occasional slapstick comedy or just like watching soldiers killing bad guys by poking them in the eyes, Hot Shots Part Deux! is just your kind of film!

The picture is presented in 1.851 Anamorphic, which is generally a nice transfer (Though there is a little grain in the darker scenes) with solid blacks and vibrant colors. Audio is presented in Dolby 2.0 surround, which is quite decent, even though there aren't many surround effects. For extras we get two making of featurettes, the first being An adventure in film-making, in which we see some behind-the-scenes-footage, the second featurette, Early awareness, consists mostly of cast and crew interviews, as well as what it's like to do slapstick films. Both documentaries are nice little additions to an already impressive disk. We also are treated to the films trailer and a french and Spanish language track. My rating for the DVD 8/10.

Unfortunately, Hot Shots! Part Deux, as good a film as it is, it just doesn't live up to the first film.   Part Deux is about U.S. marines that have been captured in the Middle East and a mission is being planned to rescue them and it seems that there is only one man for the job, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen). Once being forced back into action after discovering his former commander was captured on the previous attempt to rescue the hostages, Harley and a handful of marines (including his ex, Ramada) go to the rescue. Little do they no that there is a mole who is out to sabotage the mission.Like the first film, Part Deux relies heavily on the visual gags to get the laughs. Obviously, if you've seen the first film then you'll know what to expect. Also, like the first, it relies on one main film to take the p*** out of, in this case it being Rambo 3 (which it undoubtedly deserves).Performance wise, Charlie Sheen is just the same as he was in the first just beefed up a lot more. The same can be said about Valerie Golino, returning as Ramada and Lloyd Bridges, this time playing the President (brilliantly it must said). Abrahams keeps the gags coming thick and fast right from the start which keeps the viewers mind of the very basic plot. It's also a good thing that the film is short otherwise it would just get too boring. Some of the jokes are really funny but nothing that will have you in fits.Hot Shots!

For those, however, who just watch it for the spoof that it is will be rewarded by a laugh-a-minute riot in the vein of AIRPLANE and NAKED GUN, whose creators, Jim Abrahams, also brought this hilarious parody to the screen. It's dumb all right, but not without being funny.Charlie Sheen reprises his role as Topper Harley, who in the first film is a parody figure of Maverick from TOP GUN. Now, he is more of a parody of John Rambo from FIRST BLOOD, and he's hilarious. Sent on a mission to free prisoners, and the rescuers sent to free them (and the rescuers sent to free them, and so on...). During the mission, he is re-teamed with his ex-flame Ramada (Valeria Golino), who is also on the same mission to save his brilliant husband Dexter (a pre-Mr. Bean Rown Atkinson). Lloyd Bridges is back, this time as the old and klutzy idiotic President Tug Benson, where in one very hilarious scene, duels with Saddam Hussein, which includes parodies of STAR WARS, TERMINATOR 2 and many more.In fact, this film has enough references to other movies and pop culture to fill in its own dictionary. Even if some of it seemed far-fetched and just plain stupid, that's exactly the point. This movie was not made to be smarter (or stupider) than what it is. Since it's a parody, and it is funny, it does its job well. Throughout the film, I laughed a lot, and as long as you don't expect anything more from it, you will to. Rating **** out of 5.

When he refuses to go, his mentor, Col Walters goes instead and is captured.  Reluctantly Topper goes in to rescue him and the others.While far from being one of the better spoofs this film is still a good comedy.  The plot is meaningless but it is hard to overlook the fact that it is rather tasteless looking back at it now - war in Iraq wasn't a joke back then but it is even harder to find it like total fantasy now.  However, if you feel very strongly about it, it is unlikely you'd watch this film! The jokes are mainly spoofs of films and genres, but I must admit that I didn't laugh out loud often enough to justify it.  I think the problem was that I found it too silly rather than clever silly.  Having said that, it is still amusing even if it is not as sharp and consistent as better spoofs such as Naked Gun or Airplane.If you know your films then you should get a kick out of it - a scene with Martin Sheen making a cameo manages to spoof three films within 10 seconds - but the generally quality of the gags is poor; like I said - just a bit too silly for my tastes.  Despite this the cast still do good work with the material.  Sheen is still as able as he was in the first film and is happy to send himself up; Bridges is very funny but gets lets down by his material here - he is funnier in the first film.  Golino continues her input by `looking very sexy' but not much else.  Kudos to Crenna and Ferrer for sending up their tough guy image - especially Ferrer!  Support from Stiles, Atkinson and Wohl is good but again the material isn't totally there for them.Overall, this is a silly film and enjoyable if you are in the mood for it. I would say however that, although the total misses are quite infrequent, there are too few really big laughs in it.  The end result is a feeling of mild amusement rather than me ending the film feeling like I'd really roared with laughter.

Part Deux","Date":"12 April 2015","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" The original movie turned out to be a big success so the inevitable sequel came along, this time they primarily went for an out n out spoof of 'Rambo III'. Most of the same cast members are back from the original in the same roles accept for Ryan Stiles who reappears again but as another character oddly (I guess we didn't see him properly in the first flick). As for the title...deux is obviously French for the number two, so was this suppose to be a funny alternative to simply having 'part 2'? bit lame.So everything you got with the first movie you get all over again with this...accept this time the belly laughs are much greater and the visual tomfoolery is much better. The plot follows along the lines of 'Rambo III' with the obligatory changes and simplifications here and there, again this is a complete story and not just a collection of jokes or skits tied together. Once again its directed and written by Jim Abrahams so the quality is still on par with his previous offering.The comedy angle in this movie is much more politically satirical in places with a slightly more grown up vibe. The film starts off with a brilliant sequence showing the dastardly Saddam Hussein (the 90's remember) getting ready for bed in his lavish palace. The entire scene is chock full of brilliant little visual gags, childish gags and some genuinely clever comedy, naturally it all ends in a farcical bit of slapstick but its all really well directed. Jerry Haleva who portrays Hussein really hams it up perfectly giving a great little dialog free performance whilst looking quite authentic. I watch today in amazement that they got away with such blasphemy, these days I'm sure there would be some nasty backlash.From that sharp controversial lampooning we move onto the next big sequence involving the introduction of Sheen's character Topper. Topper is now a buffed up Buddhist living in a small Thai village where he fights for the sheer pleasure of manly violence. Here we see a quite ingenious fight sequence littered with many great visual moments such as Topper's candy coated hand wraps, Richard Crenna's pig snout sub with running mustard, a crowd member getting his head kicked off and the fight ref getting his head squashed between the two fighters flying kicks. It sounds horrific at times and lets not beat around the bush there is some heavy Tom & Jerry style violence in here. But as before the effects are so cheap and tacky looking, so utterly ridiculous and hokey, its quite clear no one (including kids) is gonna be upset by anything here, its a complete cartoon once again. That's not to say the effects are purposely hokey everywhere, far from it, there are also some quite lovely little touches dotted throughout the picture. Who can forget the excellent freezing and shattering of Saddam ala 'T2', the enemy soldier splattered across the side of a hut and Saddam getting crushed under the grand piano. Some of the makeup effects are really nicely done too, clearly the budget for this was much beefier than before.What did impress about this movie was how action packed it was, one exciting scene after another. The attack on the enemy camp as the plot reached its climax is probably the most iconic although the riverboat attack sequence was pretty sweet too. Sheen looks pretty darn good all buffed which was surprising really, he actually went to a lot of trouble to actually look ripped just for a stupid spoof. Anyhow this is where Sheen shines as he runs around this enemy camp doing a Schwarzenegger ('Predator' if anything) and gunning down hordes of armed soldiers without getting a scratch. The video game high score text that pops up on screen telling us the body count and what other ultra violent adult movies the movie now equals and consequently tops, is totally inane but admittedly clever. I love how completely bonkers the action sequence gets trying to lampoon classic action set pieces...even to the point where Topper just grabs a handful of loose ammo and throws it at a bunch of enemy soldiers causing them to drop dead in overly theatrical ways. The action sequences in this movie literately lampoon the classic action man flicks to pieces...and it works.Stand out performances again go to Bridges who just gets better as he goes, some of his scenes are fecking hilarious and the way he whips out some of his dialog is monumentally montorific! Richard Crenna has a small part but his send-up of his Rambo character is super sweet, love his prison cage escape scene with Sheen. I've also gotta throw out a kudos to the small role of the Iraqi Captain played by Greg Sierra. I loved his little performances, he looked the part and has some great facial expressions. He's the bad guy who Crenna's character spits at and a huge bucket load of water hits him in the face...brilliant stuff.What I personally loved about this sequel was the fact that its crammed with so many little visual gags, there's lots going on both foreground and background, even more so than the original movie. Not only is there a lot of lampoonery going on its all of high quality, pretty much all of the jokes still hit their target even to this day. From the political jabs to the movie parodies to the out n out dumbass visual gags, like the now infamous bow and chicken firing scene. Even Rowan Atkinson in one of his first major film roles was pretty good. So yeah...I prefer this over the original any day of the week, its much funnier, wittier, visually more exciting, better effects and with much better in depth performances.'We'll settle this the old Navy way, first guy to die...LOSES!'7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Watchable,","Date":"13 May 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" Hot Shots Part Deux is a better than average movie with a alright story line and a great cast.Its definitely not better than the original Hot Shots,but its not an awful sequel.People who where fans of the first might be disappointed,but I didn't have very high hopes because I wasn't a huge fan of the first,but its definitely not as good as the first,I just found it to be a movie to just laugh at,but still misses a lot,its not as good as movies like Airplane or The Naked Gun.Fans of the first Hot Shots will probably be disappointed,but will probably still laugh at many scenes.Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) returns,this time in a parody of Rambo as he is the leader of a team in heading to Iraq to rescue a soldier who has been kidnapped.

You have a plot of a missing group of soldiers and they keep sending more in to seemingly get captured. Finally, Topper Harley is on the case going in with his own platoon to free the numerous hostages. So we get our various scenes making fun of the Rambo movies as these are the best. The ones before he sets off on his quest are not quite as good. I liked his first encounter with an old friend, the boat scene, and numerous others. The best for me was the scene when the kill counter was up and it became the bloodiest movie of all time!!! It also has a great scene between Lloyd's character and a Sadaam look a like.

Part Deux more times than I would like to remember, yet it's still funny.  The same thing holds true for its ancestors like Airplane! and The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad. In fact, I just saw it last night and noticed a sight gag I hadn't ever seen before.  When Arvid Harbinger (one of Charlie Sheen's men on the mission to rescue POWs...played by Miguel Ferrera) is cowering in fear of the battle, he hides behind crates that conveniently contain Spineless Jellyfish and Yellow Bellies. Also, does it strike anyone else as odd that they are supposed to be invading Iraq, but the scenery does not look desert-like?  The movie was so bent on making fun of Rambo that Iraq suddenly is covered with trees and looks more like the Amazon rainforest than an Arab nation near the Persian Gulf. Denton Walters (the appropriately-used Richard Crenna) is quite funny - especially since he practically walks out of his jail cell to grab the keys required to open it. The chemistry between Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) and Ramada Hayman (Valeria Golino) is absolutely spectacular...and the script makes me laugh just thinking about it.  For all of the talk about what the critics will say about the movie, you would never know that this was a spoof by observing their deadpan faces.Funniest moments Lady and the Tramp parody. Harbinger's cheer directly to the camera after blowing away a few Iraqi soldiers War.  It's FANtastic. The theme park-like map of the Iraqi camp. The shockingly lifelike animal sounds that the crew makes after knocking out a few Iraqis.  (Related - their remarkably effective Three Stooges-like guns.) The scene with the living former Presidents. The banana peel duel between Rabinowitz (Ryan Stiles from The Drew Carey Show and Whose Line Is It Anyway?) and an Iraqi soldier. The entire monk scene is very funny. The body count meter. A great cameo by Martin Sheen. President Benson (the late and great Lloyd Bridges) reference to Sea Hunt. Actually, every single scene involving Bridges is incredibly funny. The silly credits, including several female characters listed with the maiden name Rodham and a rather mean-spirited Michael Bolton reference.Gags that fell flat The stupid chicken-as-an-arrow bit...apparently the thought process was, Chickens are always funny.  Not true.  There would have been much better shots for the poster/video box. (Such as Charlie Sheen with his hands dipped in sprinkles and M&Ms.) The fishing boat scene was a bit lame and silly.  (What were you expecting, sophisticated humor?) Using Rowan Atkinson without any reference to Mr. Bean was absolutely tragic...the writers missed a golden opportunity.  Atkinson, as usual, was still very funny. Let's face it ... that whole wounded scene after the fishing boat scene was just an excuse for Valeria Golino to tear her shirt and show some skin. It was not really funny.  The script sort of admits it. The fight scene between Golino and Sheen was kind of stupid and unnecessary.

However, this is not to say this sequel is bad--it still maintains an excellent pace and will make you laugh. That's because even more than the original, the jokes come so rapid fire that if one falls flat (as many do), there is no doubt a good laugh coming only moments later.In HOT SHOTS, the film is basically a take off on TOP GUN--with many other movie references thrown in as well. Here in PART DEUX, the story is essentially RAMBO II along with many other movie references as well. Some of the parodied films include LADY AND THE TRAMP, CASABLANCA and NO WAY OUT.The major difference in this film is the inclusion of a new major character, Saddam Hussein! He is ridiculed repeatedly and comes off as an effeminate oaf. Late in the film, the action really heats up when the President (played wonderfully once again by Lloyd Bridges) has a final showdown with Hussein...and the film degenerates into the weirdest takeoff on TERMINATOR II that you can imagine! Overall, the plot is mostly stupid and irrelevant--which is exactly what you'd expect from such a film! This is because the plot is only an excuse for stringing together many jokes and while some of the great intellectuals out there may hate this sort of film, you can't deny that it makes you laugh...unless you LIKE Saddam Hussein! The film misses about as often as it hits, but still with so many jokes this is still a crowd pleaser. Not as good as HOT HOTS or the AIRPLANE movies, it is still well worth seeing.

But despite having seen the original many times, the sequel had largely passed me by. I guess I wasn't that bothered by it - how many spoof sequels can you think of that match the original - but thankfully, I shouldn't have been that worried. By switching its focus from mocking Top Gun to the likes of Rambo, Robocop and Commando, the film retains its delightfully silly outlook on things but still goes for the jugular against a soft target.Rock God from Mars Charlie Sheen returns as Topper Harley who has now left the military and is living a simpler life in a Tibetan monastery after having his heart broken by his former squeeze Ramada (Valeria Golino).

But as before, there is a saboteur in the side and soon, Topper must seriously rack up the body count in order to get the job done.Hot Shots Part Deux is not a film to take seriously - this is as stupid a film as I can recall. Like the first, it crams every scene with sight gags, one liners and slapstick and also like the first, a fair number do raise a smile if few out-and-out laughs. It isn't anything like as funny as its spiritual predecessors like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, despite the director being one of the three responsible for them. However, it is funnier than modern spoofs like Scary Movie or Meet The Spartans but to be frank, I find the BBC News channel funnier than those films. Sheen is surprisingly funny as Topper, aping Sly Stallone perfectly despite launching a chicken from a longbow with intent, and so is Crenna who is basically playing his Rambo character for laughs instead. The rest of the cast do OK, mainly following Bridges lead but he does provide another link to the earlier, better movies. It's as if the film makers were pleading for legitimacy, saying that this is a proper spoof even if there is no Leslie Nielsen in it.I understand that Rambo-style films aren't exactly hard to spoof but Hot Shots Part Deux does a decent job of bringing them down a peg or two. It isn't a laugh-a-minute mickey-take but it does make you smile and remind you how utterly stupid most action movies from that era actually are. Even compared to the first Hot Shots!, it holds up pretty well but I couldn't escape the sense that they were trying a bit too hard. What made the likes of Airplane! so special was the screenplay which was simply hilarious on its own. There was no need for special effects besides the crude aeroplane model being buffeted by lightning - the lines and performances were enough. Here, the gags are almost drowned out by the explosions and fire fights - each scene simply takes its cue from scenes in other films but replays them for laughs. Nothing wrong with that, as such, but I just preferred the earlier spoofs to these ones. And remember, it's been a long time since spoof movies enjoyed this level of success.

The movie doesn't really ever decide what it's spoofing and doesn't think it needs to, although a central theme is the testosterone-heavy hero movies of the 80s as it takes cues from Rambo, the films of Jean Claude Van Damme, and violent comedy video games. The film also plays on everything from Goldfinger, to American Gladiator, to President Bush's famous vomiting episode.The tempo of the comedy is very rapid and very random with jokes being thrown from all directions. At best, this film can pass as a guilty pleasure, as you could take in the jokes that hit and discard the ones that miss.In terms of working as a parody, however, it's too directionless and fires off so many attempts that you can't attribute the ones that work well, to anything but sheer luck. Good parodies like Austin Powers or Blazing Saddles take a film or series of films that's firmly established in our cultural pantheon and exposes the sheer joy in tearing down its conventions. Hot Shots Part Duex has a couple examples of this like when the macho hero becomes a mother/caretaker figure to a soldier offering him a handkerchief and assures him in a Kingergarten teacher voice, we all have permission to make mistakes or when Sadam Hussein's swordfight is interrupted with a call from his wife to pick up the laundry from the dry cleaners, but it didn't capitalize on those opportunities near enough, and opted for a fusion of that humor with cheap jokes, random gags, and bathroom humor instead.If you're willing to get past the bombs, to get to the good jokes, proceed with caution.

Basically Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) has been found working at a monastery, and the CIA need him to help to lead a rescue team into Iraq to save captured soldiers. Throughout the film we also see the clumsy and idiotic encounters with President Thomas 'Tug' Benson (Lloyd Bridges), and some flashbacks to Topper's past love interest Ramada Rodham Hayman (Valeria Golino), who he is reunited with later on. The spoofs I recognised were the obvious Rambo films, The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Wizard of Oz, Basic Instinct, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, Lady and the Tramp, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Commando, Predator, Star Wars, Gladiators and there were many more. Also starring Richard Crenna as Col. Denton Walters, Brenda Bakke as Michelle Rodham Huddleston, Miguel Ferrer as Commander Arvid Harbinger, Rowan Atkinson as Dexter Hayman, Jerry Haleva as Saddam Hussein, David Wohl as Gerou, Mitchell Ryan as Sen. Gray Edwards, Michael Colyar as Williams and Ryan Stiles as Rabinowitz. The jokes can be a little bit repetitive and obvious as times, and the stupidity of the characters borders on annoying occasionally, but it has amusing bit and pieces. Okay!

The first one is pretty good. But Part Deux is right at the bottom of the pile. Pile of what, I won't say. If you want a much better film, watch AIRPLANE! I won't give anything away because it's not worth wasting more of my time. 0 stars out of 5 "},{"Title":"Most of the jokes are lazy and mediocre, but Sheen was a Wizard-King!","Date":"10 January 2014","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" Boy, some movies really seemed better when I was younger. I was a teenager when I first saw this film. I mean, I can still appreciate a slapstick, stream-of-consciousness flick like the next guy, but I'm mature enough now to see that the jokes in this one were often lazy and mediocre. Then again, some of them may have been more relevant in the 90s, like when Saddam Hussein has a clapper installed in his bedroom. By the way, tell me Jerry Haleva isn't a dead ringer (Why yes, that is a pun!) for Hussein!On the other hand, this movie is also a reminder that Sheen really was a wizard-king who drank tiger blood. I found myself cheering for him to finish with both of his leading ladies in the end (Another pun! How fun!), at the same time&#x85;now that's bi-WINNING! However, if I had to pick only one of the two to receive the Adonis DNA, I'd have to go with Brenda Bakke. Wow, was she hot!

Well grease my axels I`m coming into land ! there can`t be anyone outside of Iraq who doesn`t know that . If your going to make fun of the Butcher of Bahgdad couldn`t the makers of HOT SHOTS PART DEUX done a witty Village People number ? And that`s the problem with this , the viewer will go through most of the film telling themselves they could have done better gags because the humour in this is rather weak . I suppose there might be some amusement found in Charlie Sheen and Richard Crenna sending themselves up and the viewer shouting out the names of the films being parodied but that`s not enough to carry the film . And don`t be fooled by Rowan Atkinson`s name on the credits because his role is little more than a cameo at the end of the film  "},{"Title":"HOT SHOTS! PART DOO DOO...OOPS...I MEAN DEUX","Date":"5 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":"  This should've never been made. The first one was average at best. The second one, total turd city!! Very few laughs from very little talent. If you want a much better spoof film, check out AIRPLANE! If your thinking about watching this one again...DON'T. It's a waste of time and energy. Just goes to show Hollywood has money to burn! This film sucks on toast! BAD MOVIE RIPPER gives it a big fat ZERO out of 5 Stars.  "}]
