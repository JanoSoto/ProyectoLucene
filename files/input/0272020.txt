Warden Tony Soprano. (Anyone who writes to me, explaining the distinction between an actor's character name and his real name will get a reply explaining the distinction between hebetude and tongue-in-cheek.) New inmate profusely-decorated 3-star general Robert Redford. Theme Battle-theorist (Tony, battle memorabilia collector) versus battle veteran (Redford, whose field credits include the Gulf and other inane political coups). Premise Inmate Redford takes a dislike to the way Warden Tony disses his marine and army peeps behind bars, so launches a prison revolt, inmates rallying behind him due to his iron-fisted reputation and rakish good looks.Let the farce begin.Requisite character stereotypes abound Aguilar, the dim bulb; Yates, the amoral prison bookie; the fallen-from-grace doctor, the big black guy, the big white guy, the big guy of uncertain ethnic descent and the token Latino guy. Redford coaxes The Patriot from this ragtag band of uncertain heroes, twisting Tony's panties into cat's cradles in the process.For we who came to see Tony Soprano bust a move other than his renowned Gansta Rap, we were not prepared for the impotent swab his warden character turned out to be - even as a 'character actor playing against type', Tony was reined in by director Joe Lurie to such an extent that even when the situation warranted explosive retaliation during the siege, Tony simply sulked around his crumbling office in a prissy rage.Saluting is not allowed amongst prisoners in a military prison - something to do with loss of rank and lack of hairspray. Redford's clich√©d one-liners evokes inmate-saluting soon enough, causing big trouble in Little Italy. Which leads to Redford's punishment to bare his virile, octogenarian man-torso (we're talking' carpet-chest that makes Paul Stanley's look like a bowling green) and to move a pile of rocks from here to there. With his blond ambition and undeniable desirability to prison men of all persuasions, Redford turns this punishment into yet another spectacle with which to win over the hearts of his fellow crims.All the philosophy, chess-playing and tough love comes from the convicted criminal in this film - Redford - so the viewer is cajoled into rooting for the WRONG side. The attempts at tear-jerking and patriotism and brotherhood are completely misplaced by the fact that this bake sale is held - in a JAIL. And the good guys.are the bad guys. When was the last time you supported a prison revolt, replete with murder and destruction of taxpayer property, cheering on the cons in their noble cause to usurp authority?Redford uses Tony's own armaments against him; the water-cannon, the trebuchet (the wha-?). This last weapon turned up out of nowhere, like Monty Python's Trojan Rabbit, when the plot had degenerated to guys running around and burning things, and the director thought no one would notice the appearance of a construct that literally cannot be hidden anywhere on prison grounds. (The Great Escape this ain't.) Checkmate is to capture the warden's American flag and fly it upside down, which denotes a distress signal, a concept which they make abundantly clear through the dialog of about twenty people. Okay - I heard you the SEVENTH time - so if the American flag winds up flying upside down, nobody's a terrorist or anti-American - sheesh!To cap this farce with the seal of disbelief, these guys don't even want to escape - they just want another warden. I got news for you, guys the warden may change, but the JOB-DESCRIPTION remains the same, i.e. it's his DUTY to retain your low self-esteem, disorientation and to KEEP YOU IN JAIL. Changing the management amounts to nothing more than amending the names on the doors and letterheads. Of all people, you military perps should understand that in contravening The System's laws, you yourselves have empowered The System to isolate you from it.A prison is NOT a democracy - at least, not the last time I was in one. Since when do we grant prisoners the expertise to diagnose anti-social behavior in a warden? Or the inalienable right to OVERTHROW the prison if they don't like the conditions? Yeh, jail sucks - it's meant to!In the final scene, Redford flashbacks to his Sundance Kid days, as an army trains their rifles on him in the rec yard, waiting for the word from Don Soprano to bake his ziti. Redford carries the folded flag stolen from Tony's office, and word on the street was that he was gonna raise that puppy upside down, thereby broadcasting Tony's incompetence to the Five Families. So Tony must stop him at all costs; he faces Redford, staunchly 'Give me back my flag!'Redford 'It's not 'your' flag.' Ouch! - now that was so patriotic, it made my thighs supple. Sundance strides to the flagpole and resolutely starts raising the flag, as Tony is screaming at his men to shoot him down - but of course, each rifleman's dreams were now rife with frolicking in that snowy-white chest-jungle with the blue-eyed avenger-general who defied a mob boss. They lower their weapons - and it is up to The Jersey Godfather to whack Boy Redford. Of course, he is arrested immediately by his lieutenant; something to do with The Law - The Law which they suddenly want to adhere to, after not giving it a moment's thought during the last hour's siege.Camera pans up the flagpole and - the flag is flying, proud and true - RIGHT SIDE UP. And the convicts salute it. And the guards salute it. And the music swells, as Redford dies with a smile, flag fluttering in battle-smoke breeze, cheese glutting all Exit doors.Probably the best advice one could offer to someone contemplating viewing this movie - Fuggedaboudit!(Movie Maniacs, visit www.poffysmoviemania.com) "},{"Title":"Redford has the ability to fade","Date":"20 August 2005","Score":"67 out of 103 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Redford's ability to fade into a character is profound. Sometimes an actor who has been in the business a very long time will become larger than any role he plays... John Wayne for example (with a couple of exceptions). He becomes Eugene Irwin in this movie. This movie isn't about Redford's character, just like The Legend of Bagger Vance isn't really about Bagger Vance. The Last Castle is about honor to one's self and honor among soldiers, even if they are prisoners. James Gandolfini's portrayal of a colonel who knows nothing of this honor or brotherhood is excellent. He makes you despise his character. Colonel Winters is a deeply disturbing study of corrupt power and jealousy of others' glory. A fine ensemble cast of characters make this movie well worth watching.

I thought the previews looked interesting and at the very least I loved The Rock and think Redford is great so I figured this movie would be good. Heck I almost skipped paying the $4 rental fee to just buy the DVD. Glad I didn't.Despite what others may believe, I feel that this movie strongly apes Shawshank Redemption and other heretofore well-tramped ground. We have a  power-hungry, egocentric warden, a quiet, reserved new prisoner who was quite successful on the outside and whose previous life is known of by his inmates. And a struggle of wits, warden vs. prisoner plays out like a game of chess. Interesting to note, both Shawshank and Last Castle incorporate chess as the greatest battle of wits...I doubt the similarity is coincidental.The acting is good...I won't take that away from the film. The characters are relatively believable and the actors handle their roles well. The problem with this film is that it relies too much on illogical or contradictory ideas to move itself along. Ok, first the title the last castle is contradicted again and again as Redford keeps saying that anywhere you raise the flag and say you can't take this away from me is a castle. It's almost the theme of the film and it directly contradicts the title...seems like a case of a line too good to throw out, even though it really does not fit.Also, Redford demonstrates a great deal of respect to the warden but speaks very harshly of him when the warden is simply removed to the other room to grab a book to have signed. Redford criticizes the warden in a most uncivil way right in front of the warden and it just doesn't make sense...it's completely unlike the character to do so. But there has to be some animosity between the two and that was the easiest way to do it...illogical yes, but whatever gets the action moving, right? The guards are also painfully one-dimensional. We get a glimpse early on that the captain is a good guy forced to do bad things but all that we know of the snipers, etc. is that they enjoy shooting prisoners and that the warden enjoys manipulating everyone within the walls. A scene that showed them to be human, to have any feeling other than hate for prisoners, would make them far more believable and make the story that much better...again, this is an action movie and moving the story along fast is key not a logical progression of events, not keeping the promise to show both sides of the story made in the opening scenes.In short, this movie is woefully inconsistent. Is it filled with good action sequences, especially for a prison movie. Is it entertaining...sure, it's not bad. But as a film, a piece of art, it just does not pass muster...in their attempts to push this movie onto the screen the film makers simply left too much out and obviously did not spend enough time developing the script. It has so much potential and so little payoff. A 6 in my book.

Yes indeed I can confirm this , castles are very old and they were built to keep people out . As THE LAST CASTLE continues we learn lots of other interesting information like bullets can travel very fast and can kill you ( No sh*t ) and where saluting comes from . What I didn`t learn was anything about the military prison where it`s set or about the inmates which is a major disadvantage seeing as the movie revolves around a military prisonI`ve no idea how the United States treats servicemen who`ve fallen foul of the law , but I do know how Britain treats hers . In Britain servicemen commiting minor infractions are usually sent to the  Glasshouse  ( Every military base has its own ) while for more serious disciplinary matters like testing positive for drugs or going AWOL British servicemen are sent to the military prison at Colchester for a period ranging from a few days to several months after which they`re returned to their regiment or discharched from the military . For more serious crimes like murder , rape etc servicemen are sentanced by a civilian court of law and this is what confused me about THE LAST CASTLE - Why are the inmates sentanced to many years in a military prison ? Wouldn`t they be sent to a state prison ? Not only that but if it`s a military prison wouldn`t it be a disciplined environment ? The one seen here is no different than any other one you see in cinema with all the inmates hanging around the yard , all aged in their mid 20s to late 40s and all hanging with their own ethnic groups . I often found myself forgetting this was a military prison for large chunks of time and was only reminded it was run by the military when the action cut to Col Winter`s office!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!The actual plot of THE LAST CASTLE is about the battle of wills between the prison commander Col Winter and new arrival General Irwin . Irwin was a hero from Vietnam ( I wonder if he`s based on John McCain ? ) who upsets Winter by stating that because he collects all sorts of military memorabillia Winter couldn`t have served on a battlefield which understandably upsets Winter because it`s a bizarre comment to make . Let`s see now absolutely no one in history who collects military artifacts has never been in the field ! I won`t bother to point out how inaccurate this sweeping generalization is except to say it`s used to set up the battle of wills in a very weak example of scripting . And the more the story goes on the more aware you become that the production team have little knowledge of military or political matters . It turns out Irwin was in charge of a mission to Burundi in central Africa which cost the lives of eight American soldiers and it`s this that led to him being sent down for ten years . Are you trying to tell me that if an American commander is in charge of a military mission that goes wrong he`ll find himself sent to prison for many years ? Well in that case General McArthur should have been sentanced to hundreds of years in prison for the Chinese intervention in Korea and General Westmoreland should have been shot for the Tet offensive . Did General Garrison do time in prison for the events in BLACK HAWK DOWN ? Oh and it should be pointed out that America never intervened in Burundi , just thought I`d point that out . But it goes from bad to worse as General Irwin leads his men on a prison revolt ( Bet you couldn`t see that coming chaps ? ) where the inmates reveal right out of the blue a siege engine .  What`s that ?  Col Winter shrieks . A siege engine , a catapult to be more accurate , a catapult that must stand thirty foot high that none of the guards seem to have noticed , isn`t there a minimum eye sight requirement in the American military ? Just curious since no one seems to have noticed a thirty foot catapult standing around . Perhaps Hollywood should bring in a basic intelligence test for its screenwriters ?I won`t bother telling you how the story ends except to say if you can reach the end credits without turning off you deserve some sort of medal for watching a movie above and beyond the call of duty "},{"Title":"Highly unlikely, but entertaining nonetheless...","Date":"4 February 2007","Score":"34 out of 56 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" A prisoner's fantasy decorated U.S. General Robert Redford has been Court Marshalled for disobeying orders during wartime--which resulted in the deaths of eight soldiers--and is sent to a prison for violent criminals (!). He immediately gets on the wrong side of warden James Gandolfini and rallies the inmates to take control of the yard. Fairly typical genre picture with all the usual details, including the stuttering innocent whose bad treatment becomes a catalyst in the warring sides. The film is well-cast and has some fine passages, yet the heavy symbolism (with flying flags, chess moves and endless talk of castles) comes off as self-important in a movie which uses its entire second half to allow violent criminals to run roughshod over security. Redford gives a modest, self-effacing performance--he's so noble he's like visiting royalty; Gandolfini plays his Colonel like an offended child, affecting a soft but precise, lispy voice, giving the one-dimensional role some unexpected subtext. The handsomely photographed film looks great and works its way slyly on the viewer until all defenses are down, but in retrospect its earnestness seems woefully silly. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Only watch this for a laugh","Date":"7 March 2006","Score":"31 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time - but unfortunately I don't think it's meant to be. From the forbidden salutes to jailed general Robert Redford - which prisoners get round by saluting and then smoothing down their hair - to the ridiculous siege weapons which the prisoners have somehow been able to make in the prison workshops. I mean, we know the director is trying to compare the prison riot to a medieval siege but do we really need all the prisoners running around with shields made of trays, bows and arrows and a trebuchet (oh yes). I was only waiting for the final swordfight between Redford and the warden to be shown as shadows cast on the prison wall. It's totally laughable and has one of the cheesiest endings you will ever see.

I didn't have many expectations for it either. I am not a Robert Redford fan and I was not familiar with the work of James Gandolfini, but because I am an action fan and the trailer made this out to look like a not to bad action movie I decided to pick it up. The problem with most action movies that run over two hours is that they usually become boring and bogged down with confusing plot twists that ruin the entertainment value. But this movie never once became boring, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. Redford and Gandolfini lit up the screen with red hot performances that kept you at the edge of your seat. This movie has everything you could ask for in an action movie, strong performances, strong script, beautifuly directed action sequences and dare I say it, a few touching moments. Redford plays a war hero who is sent to a prision for war verterians. He then plans an uprising against the corrupt prision guard. Your heart will instantly go out to a shy inmate who was accused of beating someone to death with a hammer. The film also has some of the most mouth dropping action scenes that I've seen in a long time. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. So whether you are a fan of prision movies like The Shawshank Redemption or Fortress or a hardened action fan this movie will not dissapoint. I rank this film as one of the best of 2001 along side Made.

Rod Lurie's vision, combined with the extraordinary talents of Robert Redford and James Gandolfini, is a morality play set in the most unlikely of locations. We have a man who has risen to the height of his potential, the Colonel, who will never advance above that rank, and is bitter with his role in life. He is an administrator among soldiers who wanted to be a soldier and was instead given the task of maintaining order at a prison. That he could show leadership by helping these men to regain their self respect and dignity has escaped him, and he is content to amuse himself by creating situations which lead to the prisoners becoming the animals he believes them to be. When the General comes to his prison, he thinks he has found a kindred spirit who can appreciate his manipulation of the men. To his disappointment, he finds the General a thoughtful and honorable soldier who has chosen to accept his punishment without excuse or explanation. While the Colonel must fight to maintain control, his methods and his intellect lack humanity and understanding. The General is given control by the prisoners because of his intellect and understanding. He offers the prisoners the one thing the warden cannot, dignity. Rated R for language and violence, this film is not for everyone, and certainly not for the very young. It is, however, an essential element in the creation of a leader, and should be seen by anyone who aspires to lead.

Having seen the previews I thought nothing of ever seeing the film, but saw it on the shelf in the video store and thought it would pass an evening.It did that very well, and is worth seeing for at least one reason. Although Robert Redford puts in a solid performance, James Gandolfini steals this movie with his simpering, bully-boy performance. Despite knowing from the opening scene that he will undoubted lose against Redford's disgraced general, Gandolfini's depiction of a man in authority but with little power is very subtle and worth watching.The rest of the film has some clever moments, but you see everything coming - Redford inspiring the other prisoners, the inevitable conflicts and the finale.  The Last Castle is worth seeing once.

For my money, the film's weaknesses slightly outweigh its strengths but I can easily see someone else's scales tipping the other way.The performances are splendid all around.  Most especially, James Gandolfini (who had the inside track with the most richly drawn character) excels as the ambiguous villain who is actually right more than half the time.The message which deals with the value of pride and the importance of identity and self-worth is certainly admirable.  The fact that this occurs among men who have marred their own self-worth through violent crime makes the concept that much more interesting.  It almost (but never quite) raises the idea of reclaiming integrity, once lost.  If it had gone this extra mile, it may well have been a better film.The weaknesses lie in the hundreds of stupid little inaccuracies which culminate into one stupid BIG inaccuracy  This place doesn't feel like a prison!It is difficult to make a prison movie within ten years of 1994 without inviting comparisons to The Shawshank Redemption.  Rather than belaboring the obvious, I want to note one detail that is exemplary of the earlier film's superiority.  Even the jolliest, funniest, most easy going prisoners in Shawshank had an underlying sense of danger about them.  You didn't want to get on their bad side.  You never doubt that they belong in prison (except, of course, for Andy Dufresne).  But this is not so in The Last Castle.  No matter how often someone reads from a prisoner's file and discusses the horrible things he has done, none of the words, actions, or other moods conveyed by the men in this film make them seem in any way dangerous.  Maybe it's a case of mass miscasting but I doubt it.Compounding this problem is the lack of scholarship to be found in the little details.  Robert Redford shaves with a safety razor in spite of the fact that no prisoner would be allowed such a tool.  Razor blades, like belts and shoelaces, are potential suicide tools and, thus, prohibited in prisons.  Also, people keep referring to an officer's side arm as his gun instead of his weapon.  These mistakes were easy to avoid and yet they remained in the film.All of this makes a potentially fascinating film, filled with talent, seem a touch removed from reality.  Like in The Contender, director Rod Lurie has shown that his view of reality is based on his opinions rather than the other way around.With all it had going for it, it's a shame really.

A former film critic, Lurie has emerged in the last few years as a maker of old-fashioned good movies well made.  He impressed me last year with the political drama The Contender, and this year he brings us The Last Castle, a prison picture that overcomes some dramatic potholes to provide a solid two hours' worth of entertainment.The castle in question here is a maximum security military prison, home to the armed forces' toughest offenders.  The whole place is ruled by Col. Winter (James Gandolfini), a tinpot tyrant who delights in turning his prisoners against one another.  Make them forget they are soldiers, make them forget they are MEN, and you will win...that's Winter's philosophy. Then, a monkey wrench is thrown into the works, in the form of Gen. Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford), a much-decorated three-star general court-martialed for a battlefield infraction.  Irwin immediately sees Winter for what he is, and as his weeks in the prison wear on, he begins to realize that he is surrounded by SOLDIERS, tough, competent, and ready to fight.  All they need is a general to get behind...and a villain to rally against.The Last Castle is a character-driven piece, and is carried by the strengths of its performances.  Robert Redford takes a character who is admittedly rather sketchily written and, through sheer force of his charisma and personality, turns him into someone quirky and specific.  Irwin is more like the Sundance Kid than any character Redford has played in some time a rebel battling against a system that has arrayed insurmountable odds against him.  This time, however, Irwin is a product of the system, and he knows its rules.  Redford conveys that wisdom with a bemused grin or a mere flex of his craggy but still handsome face.  This, folks, is star power.The actors surrounding him put in equally fine work.  James Gandolfini is miles away from The Sopranos as the despotic Col. Winter, and makes him a fine villain, loathsome yet pathetic and curiously affecting at the same time.  Mark Ruffalo comfortably wears the role of the prison bookie, a cynic whose father was a Vietnam P.O.W. with Irwin, and Clifton Collins, so creepy and evil as the assassin Frankie Flowers in Traffic, turns in a drastically different turn here as a stuttering corporal who first recognizes Irwin's greatness.Lurie helms this material with assured confidence.  He gives the film a gritty, authentic look and feel, he knows how to recognize a dramatic moment and pay it off, and he handles the film's quieter scenes and its boisterous action payoffs with equal elan.  Any way you slice it, it's just good filmmaking.Though David Scarpa and Graham Yost spike their screenplay with memorable moments and fine dialogue, they shoot themselves in the foot with third-act implausibilities (you'll find yourselves asking more than once, Now how did they manage to throw THAT together?) and an abrupt finale that leaves too many unanswered questions.Still, even with these problems, The Last Castle is a solid, rousing piece of mainstream entertainment.  It's well-made, it tells a good story without insulting your intelligence or your good taste, and it showcases some fine acting by veterans and newcomers alike.  And I bet Lurie didn't even break any of his cameras.  I'm sure Dreamworks appreciates that, if nothing else.

I'll get straight to the point. The premise of a highly decorated war hero Army general being sent to (presumably) Leavenworth military prison is, at the least, a bit unlikely. Much more likely is that he'd have been allowed to retire. But this is Robert Redford and he's got Principles (not to mention being a loose cannon)!Now, it's hard to get to the top of the heap in the military by not knowing how to play the game and by choosing one's battles very carefully (at least political ones). But then if the producers had been that realistic, the movie would never have been made. So the great general goes to prison, drawing from his 6 years in the Hanoi Hilton. What does he do? He starts leading the troops, er, excuse me, prisoners, because there are no soldiers among the inmates, and no rank, etc. etc.A military prison would not be that much different from a civilian one. The major difference is that the inmates of the former were convicted of committing crimes while serving in the military. That means you'd have your share of thieves, murderers, sexual predators and other assorted sociopaths. It seems, however, that the producers of The Last Castle thought otherwise. Why these are men who are just in need of a charismatic leader to whip them into shape.Well, I think I've made my point. The great general manages to inspire these thieves, murderers, etc., to achieve real greatness. Oh yes, there's the warden, played by Tony Soprano, er, James Gandolfini. I have to confess that I couldn't keep from thinking about The Sopranos every time I saw him. I also couldn't help wishing I were watching that instead of The Last Castle.The final sequence is so far-fetched that it borders on the ludicrous.Potential Spoiler Alert!It really crossed the line when a guy climbs up a chain and manages to enter into a helicopter and SINGLEHANDEDLY overpowers the door-gunner and pilot. He then slams the tail into a tower and survives the subsequent crash landing. This would have worked in a Die Hard movie with good ol' Bruce Willis, but not in a movie that takes itself far too seriously. Well, at least he was a helicopter pilot in the Army.Add to that an embarrassing assortment of clich√©s, rousing music, a gratuitous scene with the alienated daughter, and you have it, a solid 2 star movie. I only give it that because at least it was competently produced. I have satellite, so these movies are repeated quite frequently. However, this is one I will NOT be tuning into even if there's virtually nothing else to watch. I'd rather take a nap, read a book, go shopping, do just about anything than sit through this one again....

General Irwin's reputation is still very much alive, to the point that the jail's commander has a certain degree of respect for him. Regardless of this though, Irwin must not abide by Winter's rules and become just another of the men. Looking to just serve out his time and go home, Irwin tries to accept his new surroundings, but he finds that the men look to him with a respect that he wishes would go away. However as he becomes familiar with the practises within the prison, he cannot help but assume a leadership role &#150; bringing him into direct confrontation with Winter over the brutal, domineering methods he uses.Despite being a total box office flop, I was still sufficiently attracted by Lurie and the cast he had put together to give this film a chance (albeit on DVD rather than in the cinema). The film is a mix of two types of film and it manages to do neither of them that well, but well enough to produce an enjoyable if forgettable film. The first half of the film is a sort of drama, with Irwin teaching the men the respect and humanity that (supposedly) they once had as soldiers. This half is OK mainly because the fatherly Redford makes his character work pretty well at this stuff &#150; it isn't brilliant but it is OK to watch. The second half sees the film become increasingly illogical as the contest between Irwin and Winter intensifies up to the point where a slightly silly final action sequence. I won't say enough to spoil it for anybody, but the final sequence of events grows more and more unlikely by each passing event. Happily it is also quite exciting for what it is and the temptation to scoff at it is delayed (slightly) by the distraction value of it. It is not a great story by any means but it is workable &#150; and the director and cast are just about good enough to make the weak into the watchable, the empty into the entertaining.Ex-Empire critic Lurie will always interest me because he had the guts to do what few critics could &#150; stop analysing others and make something themselves. His direction is good and he handles the action sequences well (their weaknesses being in their writing, not in his delivery). The cast are talented and do their best with a script that is not as good as their talent deserved. Redford has an easy task &#150; playing an elder statesman, full of charisma and high principles. He does this well as one would expect from an actor if his caliber. Gandolfini plays back his accent in an attempt to keep his character away from his 'Sopranoisms' but the script doesn't help him. Gadolfini plays a 'little man', one whom we half feel sorry for and half we dislike; he does well to keep both these sides out, but at the end of the film the script is only really interesting in making him a controlling monster and his performance doesn't really matter one way or the other. The support cast has quite a few well-known faces, most of who are pretty good. Lindo is more of an add-on but the ever-reliable Ruffalo who shows here why he now has the reputation of a solid support man.Collins has a simple, stuttering character but it is still nice to see him in something other than a gangbanger role. The rest of the support are good enough, even if they don't have a great deal to do.Overall this is an average film that seems to aspire to a higher level at one point and then just settle for action and explosions at later stages. None of it really amounts to much but the first half is enjoyable as a fairly clich√©d drama and the second half is quite enjoyable even if it is silly and overblown. I can understand why it didn't really do much at the box office but as a DVD it works well enough to pass a few hours even if it never really does much more than go through the motions.

This is a movie shows how one man with a huge ego and in a position of power can single handedly break a man's pride and spirit and that of another who shows a group of men that despite their circumstances your pride and self respect is something no one can take from you unless you allow them to. If this is what is considered a bad movie, I'd like to know what a good movie is. The Last Castle is a movie that you have to watch to judge it yourself and not base it on the opinions of others.

It is dealing with justice for military personnel and soldiers. No one will question the justness of a court-martial but what happens to a soldier, what's more a three star general, if he is court-martialed to serve some time in a military prison. The prisoners in that prison have been humiliated and broken down into some wild animals because a colonel only decided to see the crimes of these men and not the good potential that was and always will be in them as soldiers, and probably as men. They were trained soldiers and they have made a mistake that they have to pay for, but they are no animals. They are human and they remain human, they are military and they remain military with some strong powerful values they still are ready to die for provided they find a good leadership. The colonel who is abusing his power as the boss of this military prison does not understand any other language than repression and force and killing those who do not obey. It can only work when the mass of the prisoners are divided and hostile to one another. Bring one high ranking officer among them who will know how to rebuild their self-pride and their sense of honor and they will follow him to regain their military humanity. The best part in the film is that it demonstrates how easy it is to organize a take-over in such a prison if you are imaginative and you have the sense of command and the sanity to respect the best in each man. What's more the soldiers on the side of the colonel will also recognize in the prisoners and their fight the high human and military values they believe in. These soldiers will decide to isolate the colonel and even arrest him for having lost control of his fortress by his own efforts and lack of moral humanism. The film is probably slightly optimistic on that point but it can go through because the flag of the fortress, which is also the flag of the USA but could be the flag of any country, is in the hands of the main rebel and he is going to hoist up on its flagpole. That very act, though the three star general prisoner will be shot while doing that by the defeated colonel, just before his own captain arrests him, creates a reaction among all the soldiers, prisoners or not that leads them to salute the flag and find an epiphany in that act. No matter what the colonel used to say, before being court-martialed in his turn, these men may have done something wrong but they remain human beings and soldiers. Once a corporal, always a corporal. You cannot have and have been, because once you have become you will always be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr√©teil, CEGID "},{"Title":"Robert Redford vehicle.

These men have been stripped of honor and a sense of humanity which is one of the reasons they put on uniforms and fought for freedom in the first place. These men are not merely prisoners or civilian criminals as in Shawshank, these are military men who at the time of their crimes wore U.S. Military uniforms. Many of them were burnt offerings or sacrifices by higher command to appease the masses for high crimes; someone must pay for these political faux pas, and seldom is it the one giving the orders. Granted, some were common criminals wearing uniforms, but a good number were merely following orders and were thusly blind-sided. The Warden, though rather gleeful in his job, understood the danger of allowing soldiers to play soldier. Redford, on the other hand recognized the necessity of that very diversion to restore hope and manhood to this group of men. I would hope that viewers would allow themselves to see beyond their own military vs. anti-military stances and actually watch the interactions of the representations in this film.

Eventually it didn't seem to be too far from the norm for a military prison, so the cause of the rebellion isn't shown to be all that strong.By halfway through it seemed at that it could be a remake of the excellent Mackenzie Break. In much the same way in this film I was intrigued whether Redford was supposed to be a hero or a reckless egomaniac. For this ambiguity it deserves a few points even though I now realise that this ambiguity was probably unintentional.The ambiguity is then destroyed in the final scenes. Redford is revealed as an all-American hero, and the film becomes just another gung-ho movie in the John Wayne mould. You could then laugh at the sudden appearance of a fully-trained and equipped army from among the prisoners. There were also some good stunts.I suppose to American audiences it seems to be yet another patriotic movie. It is about a bunch of hardened criminals who are so full of guilt about letting down the US Marine Corps, that they will all re-unite into a crack unit with minimal persuasion by someone they know had needlessly sacrificed his men. They really loved the army, they just needed another chance. They will even shed a tear for the US flag when it is raised.To non-US audiences the whole plot is more likely to seem both confusing and hilarious. It seems more likely that an officer as an inmate in a military prison would in reality have a hard time and would do well to gain any respect, let alone instant adoration. Yet Redford's character is able to lead the prisoners in a futile attempt to take over the jail causing many innocent casualties on both sides - some hero. Somehow the American flag is invoked to make it seem justifiable. I half expected Mel Brooks or Leslie Nielsen to make an appearance and the film to be eventually revealed as a parody. Amazingly the US can still make corny films like this with a straight face.

Robert Redford does a fine performance as the reluctant hero, but two other actors are stealing the scenes even more so.

I am a big fan of the TV series and I would never have thought that he would be able to play such a prick that I would actually hate him. The second actor worth extra praise is the new talent Mark Ruffalo who played so heartbreakingly well in the amazing You Can Count On Me from last year. He portrays an ordinary character with such heart and genuineness that the character becomes so much more interesting than it would with most actors. The film is saved by its actors and its entertainment value. What pulls it down is all the logical errors and holes in the script.

The Castle's commander, Colonel Winter, is an admirer of Irwin's, and initially treats him with respect and deference. It soon becomes clear, however, that Winter is a bully who treats the prison inmates with brutality and he soon clashes with the more humane Irwin. Irwin's charisma, experience of command and concern for their welfare win him the respect of the inmates, who come to look upon him as their champion.During the first half of the film, it seemed to have the potential to become a very good one. At the heart of the film is the clash of personalities between Irwin, the charismatic battlefield commander, and Winter, a humourless, pedantic, bureaucrat in uniform who has spent his career in the military but who has never seen action in the field. Winter sees the inmates as dangerous criminals and his role as being to punish them. Irwin sees them as brave and honourable men who have gone wrong and believes that the role of the prison should be to rehabilitate them and give them back their self-respect. The roles of the two protagonists are well played by Robert Redford as Irwin and James Gandolfini as Winter, who bring out the men's contrasting characters.In the second half, however, the film quickly goes downhill and deteriorates into a standard action movie as Irwin uses his gift of leadership and knowledge of military tactics to orchestrate a prison riot with the aim of securing Winter's resignation. It is never clear, however, exactly what the men following him are hoping to achieve beyond loss of life, destruction of property and extra years added to their sentences. The resignation of one particular individual will not necessarily solve their problems. As played by Gandolfini, Winter is not an insane sadist but a by-the-book functionary whose hard-line policies have at least the tacit support of the military authorities. A new governor coming into position after a destructive riot might well take an even harder line.Although the film is set in a prison, it never has anything of importance to say about penal policy. It has been compared to Cool Hand Luke, another film in which a rebellious individual challenges the prison system. Cool Hand Luke, however, is a very different (and much better) film, an indictment of a prison system which allows a down-on-his-luck war hero to be savagely mistreated after being jailed for a petty offence. Luke is the archetypal little man taking on the system; Irwin is an establishment figure. We are, moreover, aware that most of those in the jail are there on account of crimes far more serious than that of vandalising parking meters while drunk (which was Luke's offence). Although Winter is the unsympathetic figure, he gets some of the best arguments. He points out, for example, that under his governorship there have been no escapes and no guards killed, which was not the case under the more liberal regime of his predecessor. Irwin does not really have any suggestions about how to deal with men who have committed serious, and often violent, crimes. His idea that they can recover their self-respect through firm but fair military discipline seems inadequate; many of the inmates are, after all, in prison precisely because they could not adapt themselves to the disciplined life of a soldier.This is an example of the film's tendency to raise difficult questions and then to avoid them. Another example concerns Irwin himself. Winter suggests that he may be motivated by vanity and inability to come to terms with the fact that he is no longer in command of an army. Given what we know of Irwin's character and the offence for which he was sent to prison, this may well be a fair interpretation of his motives, but when the riot breaks out any doubts of this nature are abandoned and Irwin emerges as the noble, self-sacrificing hero. Unlike some recent films, The Last Castle is not anti-military in tone. The general impression given is that, despite the presence of a few bad apples such as Winter, soldiering is an honourable profession for decent men. The ending of the film is notably patriotic, flag-waving in the most literal meaning of the term. The film's weakness is that it avoids confronting the issues of whether the actions of a Winter are not, in fact, merely a symptom of a deeper malaise and of how the military should deal with those in its ranks who are neither decent nor honourable.I watched this film when it was recently shown on television largely because I wanted to see what sort of things Robert Redford has done in recent years. It did nothing to alter my view that he is one of those actors who is fated to be remembered largely for his work in the first half of his career. Although there have been some reasonably good later performances, posterity is likely to remember him for the likes of Butch and Sundance or The Sting rather than, say, Indecent Proposal or Up Close and Personal. It is certainly unlikely to remember him for The Last Castle. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Who is the bad guy??","Date":"29 March 2003","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  ***SPOILER ALERT***I will keep my comment short because the movie already wasted two hours of my time.

It relates the story of a highly respected and exceptionally talented army general one Lt. Gen. Eugene Irwin, (Robert Redford) who was court-martial-ed for disobeying orders. Thereafter he is imprisoned within a military prison compound presided over by a lack-luster commanding officer named Col. Winter (James Gandolfini) who although he admires the general, believes himself to be his superior. The disgraced general may have been broken in rank, but his reputation soon becomes apparent when the prisoners look to him to re-mediate the harsh, cruel and sadistic methods imposed by the warden. A mental chess game inaugurates between the imposing warden and the prisoner general. Everything the Colonal has learned from books now is tested against actual experience and the outcome is to be over-seen by Gen. Wheeler who seeks to either remove Irwin to another prison or discharge Winter for incompetence. A superb role for Redford who's every bit imposing as a military officer and the superior cast which includes Mark Ruffalo, Steve Burton and Delroy Lindo as Gen. Wheeler. Indeed, this is an exceptional movie and one recommended to anyone seeking the definition of a true leader. **** "}{"Title":"The General And His Jailer","Date":"20 December 2008","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" A military prison may be one like none other. In a military prison the inmate population has some history of order and discipline which can be a good thing for the guy who's in charge. But if a charismatic leader gets assigned in the prison population it could be a disaster.Which is what happens in The Last Castle. Prison commandant Colonel James Gandolfini gets a real special prisoner in his charge, a former three star Lieutenant General Robert Redford. This guy was courtmartialed for disobeying an order in a combat situation and got several men killed as a result of it. Still he commands a lot of respect including Gandolfini who'd like to cultivate the guy. But Redford sees him only as a jailer and no one who's seen any real soldiering. His view of him as a jailer plummets markedly downward over several incidents of downright cruelty he witnesses. Redford's career may be gone to hell, but he can still do something about what he sees around him. The Last Castle becomes a battle of wits and nerve between the general and his jailer as to who will control the prison. Gandolfini, most famous for playing Tony Soprano in the cable TV series, The Sopranos runs the prison just about the way you would expect gangland boss Tony Soprano to run it. He's a petty and vindictive little tyrant, a military version of Hume Cronyn's Captain Munsey from Brute Force.Redford is as noble as ever, it's hard to imagine him as a bad guy, even in Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, Redford's the upright one of the duo. Gandolfini and Redford get good support from a nearly all male cast (don't read anything into that even though this is a prison picture). Pay particular attention to Mark Ruffalo as a skeptical prisoner, Clifton Collins, Jr. whose fate prompts Redford and the rest of the prisoners to action, and Steve Burton as Gandolfini's second in command.Sometimes events have a way of thrusting themselves on people and that's what happens to Redford in The Last Castle. See the film and you'll see what I mean.

It's all well intended and professionally made, but the Last Castle has got to be one of the most pointless films of the last two decades. This is a conservative bunch of nonsense that just falls from one clich√© into another and it's very sad to see how the screenplay shamelessly covers every textbook situation. For example, our big military hero is estranged from his family and only wishes to see his grandson growing up, the initial non-believers die heroically and the American flag is raised high! It all looks ludicrous instead of patriotic and I don't think that has something to do with me not being American. Nobody really needs this type of films.

It owes a lot to other prison movies, except that it's more genteel than most stories about inmates.  The only real surprise is Gandolfini as the Colonel in charge.  He looks the part allright, burly and bespectacled, but his working-class accent keeps peeking through the pompous facade and seems to reveal him for the insecure fake he is.  My two main problems were these.1.  The plot's unbelievable.  Redford organizes an army within the military prison and they carry out their revolt with either pinpoint accuracy or surgical precision.  I can't decide which cliche is more apt.  (Maybe the inmates are angry because they're hermetically sealed within those castular walls.)  They couldn't possibly have rehearsed the action sufficiently to have carried it out with such panache.  And, anyway, whenever you plan something carefully, it always goes wrong anyway, as the viewer already knows if he's assiduously balanced his asset allocation before getting into the stock market.  2.  The revolt seems to me to lack motivation.  The colonel just isn't bad enough.  You want to find out how bad a military correctional facility gets?  Read James Jones' From Here to Eternity.  It isn't necessarily that the corrections officers are sadists, not the ones I've known anyway.  It's just that under the proper circumstances they can be pulled into the role of punisher without wanting to be, as Zimbardo's social psychology experiments at Stanford demonstrated decades ago.  (The experiment had to be aborted because the students playing the role of guards were becoming dangerous.)  Redford winds up in the slams, sees a few examples of mistreatment, and demands the resignation of the CO.  When that's not forthcoming he organizes an army and takes over the prison himself.  And for goals that aren't clearly defined.  Inmates are sacrificing their lives (and killing ordinary enlisted cadre as well) for reasons that are hard to figure out.  What actually do they want?  It's as much a mystery as it was at Attica, where every written document from the authorities, including one that granted all of the inmates' demands, were dramatically ripped up in front of an enthusiastic crowd.  Yes, what did Redford and the rest want?  To run up an American flag upside down?  To what end?   I'm afraid I can figure out the answer, although the writers and director don't tell us.  It is that they needed some kind of goal, no matter how ridiculous or petty, in order to set the story up for the final 20-minute burst of action, with the usual fireballs.  Sometimes I can be made to believe that there is a limited quantity of ideas circulating around in Hollywood circles like viruses and they mutate by rearranging their molecules, a cliche here, an obligatory explosion there.  Producing a new movie consist of filling them back and forth, switching them around, changing the order of the boxcars on a never-changing train.  What's Redford doing?  Maybe he needs the money.

But it's above the norm for the acting, and the acting alone. Redford & Gandolfini are both outstanding. Redford is the perfect hero in every way. He is able to make us believe in his plight, and I couldn't wait to see him get back at Gandolfini. James Gandolfini plays one of the most heartless people I've ever seen. I hated him, and that just shows how good of an actor he is. Mark Ruffalo is also excellent in one of his earlier rolesFinal Thoughts I did like it, but it is rather predictable as well.

While there are quite a few interesting and well-acted scenes and characters, I kept having thoughts of spy-vs-spy while watching this. It seems to be intended to be another feel-good prison movie, but it's no-where near the layered level of say Shawshank Redemption. Here you have Gandolfini's character slighted and hell-bent on getting back at the Redford who actually seems to underact his role. There are mentions of honor, code of conduct and the general list of military protocol, but they don't really fit - as the characters are prisoners. (spoiler) The ending is supposed to be poignant but it is too choreographed and predictable. Whatever the message is supposed to be it seems lost, and the movie on the whole seems mindless.

It might have some parallels to the occasional prison gone bad movie, but sometimes details can't be helped. In this case, I think that The Last Castle stood completely on its own.The acting was spectacular among the big names, and the secondary cast did a very good job of representing not only the general feeling of the movie, but with specific and importantly individual personalities.The grand finale of the movie to which it spends excellent time building is admittedly far-fetched. For instance, I find it rather unlikely that a bunch of military felons could have constructed a working trebuchet in complete secrecy, and even more unlikely to take control of a flying crowd-control helicopter. Still, even with these details the story did go a long way to explaining at least the basics of how it was conceived, planned, prepared and executed.Even at this, the movie is absolutely worth it, and enjoyable even if you might have to raise an eyebrow at the occasional detail. If you keep a DVD or BluRay collection, this is a must-have.

With good production values and good performances by the leads and supporting players, the movie fails on its premise and its surrender to Hollywoodization in the finale. The script would have us believe that every single prisoner will follow Redford's lead in taking over the facility for the purpose of getting Gandolfini canned ... every one of them! It would have us believe that the guards are uniformly sadistic, and asks us to believe that Redford can marshal a medieval campaign complete with weaponry, without being detected in advance. And it never really explains WHY this man would resort to an uprising without having exhausted the official channels to obtain humanitarian treatment in the prison.All in all, we have a pretty good first hour followed by an unbelievable conclusion. I noticed that most of the reviewers of this movie on this site are from other countries, indicating that the picture went almost entirely unnoticed domestically; unusual for a Robert Redford picture, and one may only think that Mr. Redford either needed the money (hope not!) or was doing someone a favor.

Redford's style for this brand of movie did not quite fit (the type of movie being bad of course, the only reason it is O.K. is from the headlining names and acting being mostly well done).  To get in depth to the film beyond the obtuse plot and the lack of reality, this story does have a few progressive figures that exemplify some major leadership qualities that I feel pick up the slack created by the producers and storytellers here.  It wasn't what was in the script that held these qualities, but in the actor's demeanor and how they did things. Gandolfini really made me believe he was trying to do what was right by being a hard ass, but his twitchy manner and inherent fear of the prisoners also held that underlying feeling of him playing god.  His manipulations and straight edge by the book rule, made him an effective leader to the guards (of whom several got a kick out of being the captors), but despised by the prisoners; while keeping them all in line.  Gandolfini's character's only flaw as a leader figure was his lack of creativity in battle, for up until the time of the war (riot) he was straight forward and predictable and Redford's character had him chasing his own shadow.  Now Redford's character (Gen. Irwin), was well written, he had inspiring speeches and courage, great networking ability and an excellent reputation.  His coming to the prison made the movie a bit easy though, in my opinion it should have been a lower ranking officer who had to work twice as hard and long to inspire.  Also, if anyone cares, did it seem like Redford was only half into this character? When he was there he was good, but it seemed like the other half he just said his lines and went home for the day.  Some of the best acting came from the lesser-known names, like Clifton Collins Jr. (Cpl. Aguilar). Sometimes the simplest character can be the most stirring as this actor's portrayal was of a mason workers son and the protection of his pride (the wall). Another movie to see how well he acts (even though the movie's concept has been overdone) is 187.  All in all with its good points, it needed something else to juice up the movie, maybe given more depth to events leading to Redford's incarceration or even his family.  The vagueness of these personal ties almost made it impossible to become emotionally involved in the movie and left you hanging, waiting for it, by the end.  So my recommendations are if you are going to see this movie, wait until someone else rents it and borrow it from them.

Irwin is now uniting the prisoners, and taking command in this single, last fight for a just, true system, and to reveal the corrupt running of the prison to the world. Rod Lurie the director wants his audience to understand that we can make a difference.  He wants us to know that we should never give up under any circumstances.

He wants to tell us we can change things for the better.  He wants to empower us to want to fight for what we believe in. The prisoners in The Last Castle made a difference, we could too. There was a need for change, and the inmates unified to make that change happen. This film portrays a sense of honor, dedication, courage, and hope.  It gets into us making us feel the glory of the moment. Irwin was the warden's hero, before he arrived at the prison, but by the end of the movie Irwin was the warden's worst enemy.

I rented The Last Castle when it first came out for rental and I thought it was just okay. My main selling point to customers is that it was filmed in Tennessee. On this Friday night I had a customer ask me what I thought about the Last Castle and I told her what I thought about it. I thought it was full of cliches, corny, predictable, and over long. One could say this did not please her to say the least. So she made some kind of pithy comment and this is an actually quote Well maybe I like all that stuff. I had enough with this customer so I said well that is your problem. Once again she was not pleased and stormed off with her movie. She asked for my opinion and I gave her my opinion. I guess she wanted the b.s. answer. Enough with the ranting and venting, even thou most of these customers would not know a good movie if it swam up and bit them on the ass. Finally here is my review of the said movie The Last Castle, it is all of the things that I typed. It also has little character development, but the actors do a good job with what they had to work with, and the movie is entertaining and at least renting once.

But also at this films core is the notion that the man to give them this treatment is Robert Redford. While no slacker in the charisma department, The Sundance Kid seems a bit too light for us to take the credibility leap needed to believe this a general who survived torture and multiple wars to end up here.The prisoners are a stock cast of types who get a brief definition but not enough so you are to either dislike them for any reason, or to their fault, truly get emotionally invested as well. Rod Lurie seems to have built his story on unstable ground in that his protagonists aren't all that compelling or driven (Redford's general wants to get out to spend time with his grandson and daughter and yet during the one scene with Robin Wright-Penn, Redford chooses glib responses and smart-aleck one-liners to avoid getting into any kind of honesty that Wright-Penn simply exudes. While it may be a choice for the general to defend himself emotionally, one must have a glimpse to see that this relationship is whats driving him throughout. Otherwise the scenes in which he pockets and holds his grandsons' photo have no depth and his motivation throughout lacks conviction). On top of this, Lurie hedges his bets and portrays Gandolfini and his prison cronies as, well, not all that bad.In the end one is left with an unrooted storyline about a prison uprising where you are never sure if you are truly on board for why it's happening. While Lurie has certainly shot the film well and it's stocked with great actors (the underused Mark Ruffalo and the always great Delroy Lindo) it never really gets off the ground. One can't keep you an arms length from the complexity of it's characters and then ask you to truly care about them when it most counts.

While it was moderately entertaining, I wouldn't be interested in adding it to my home movie collection.  The film starts out with two incidents that it fails to follow up on.  The first is a fight in the military prison between two inmates.  The music and fight leads you to believe that this will be like a lot of prison films people leading very hard lives, getting beat up on a daily basis, and having to fight to survive.  There was virtually none of this.  None of the prisoners are the least bit scary, and you expect them to hug each other by the final scene.  Robert Redford is immediately given respect for being a general, and doesn't have to earn anything for himself. The second surprise is that Redford's situation is left a mystery until halfway through the film.  It's alluded to several times early on that he is a 3 star general and he doesn't deserve to be in prison.  When it is finally revealed why he is in prison, it is a letdown.  You're expecting it to be a fairly prominent part of the film, and he's portrayed as someone who doesn't deserve to be there.  The director brushes over the explanation and the viewer learns that Redford, like every other prisoner, DESERVES to be in jail. This makes it very difficult to root for him when he decides to lead a gang of murderers and prisoners in an uprising against the warden.The other main problem with this film, is that Gandolfini doesn't come off as a very bad character.  Unlike the classic prison movies, you have a prisoner who deserves to be in jail, fighting against a warden who is supposed to be evil, but is never developed fully enough to show this. The whole time through the end of this movie, I kept thinking, these guys are killing innocent American soldiers who were stationed at the prison and are simply following orders.  While not many are killed, there are definitely a couple who go down permanently.  I'm supposed to be excited about this?

This means that there is definitely something of critical and psychological interest in them, which no-one has yet been able to describe or pinpoint accurately. I do not claim to be able to do so (yet), but it seems to me you must first understand where he is coming from - his personality and career progression (West Point and the US Army, followed by a period as a film critic who on occasion provoked extreme reactions of hostility from the studios whose movies he criticized, and in the last few years an undoubtedly brave attempt to put his money where his mouth is (or was), by entering the world of directing.The fascination of Lurie's films is that they deliberately deal with taboo or near-taboo subjects, - things many people consciously do not like to think about, like the prospective dropping of a nuclear bomb (by the United States) on human beings (in Deterrence).  There is a mixture of insecurity and daring in these movies - a wish to see how far he can go while at the same time desperately wanting others' approval for the technical skill he uses in doing so.Unfortunately part of this mixture also means that his movies so far carry an overtone of syrupy and simplistic political propaganda. The Contender contains, amongst other barf-inducing horrors, a cringingly embarassing presidential speech scene in which the character, played by Jeff Bridges, extols the virtues of our glorious democracy. The Last Castle is less bad in this respect, though much of it (despite the inherent interest of the military/loyalty subject-matter) still makes one wince, especially the ending.Spielberg has had a long career and has made many strange and imperfect movies, before he succeeded with the brilliant and far-sighted (but not so popular) political movie Minority Report. Maybe one day Rod Lurie too will indeed make the definitive political movie he - for the moment, elusively - seeks.

THE LAST CASTLE is the kind of good near-miss film that, in a way, is much more frustrating than a film that is truly and unredeemably awful. People watch a film like KUNG POW! ENTER THE FIST and know (if they hated the film--I'm assuming most people who saw that abomination didn't like it very much) that nothing could have been done to save it. But THE LAST CASTLE is a movie that's faraway and so close; the things in it that work aren't blotted out by the stuff that doesn't, but they are overshadowed to an unfortunate extent.What works? Simply put, the performances, especially the lead performances, are superb. Robert Redford has never had a problem playing characters who are leaders, who are used to getting what they want. The brilliant twist on that, presented through General Eugene Irwin, is that Redford doesn't just start out not really wanting anything, he basically finishes the film that way too. Oh, he wants Colonel Winter to lose his job and to give the ex-soldiers in the prison their pride and respect back, but he wants nothing for himself--after he concedes that he will not have a chance to have a relationship with his daugher and grandson. That 1 scene with Robin Wright Penn ends up selling, believably, Irwin's turn from wanting to do his time quietly to being a martyr for the cause of others. He doesn't even seem to hate Winter that much, he's just disgusted by him, and driven to show that he's a better military man at 10% of his resources than Winter is at 100%. Mr. Redford is great at showing a man who lives for the burden of command, even though that burden has left him imprisoned and could kill him.James Gandolfini is even better as Winter. It's very interesting, the way Mr. Gandolfini changes his persona so subtly to fit the role of Winter. Obviously, one difference is that his voice is almost deathly silent, a fair cry from the booming rage/joy/commanding nature of Tony Soprano, but his voice is also leeched of emotion; there's none of the introspection and black humor his Leroy had in THE MEXICAN. Something bad happened to Winter (never revealed explicitly what that was) that ruined him. He knows that he is all that he can be and that it's not nearly enough, and that Irwin either has the parts he's missing or had the life that enabled him to find them. The brilliant development in Rod Lurie's script is seeing how much Winter hates himself, and is ultimately not surprised that Irwin doesn't even care enough to hate him in return. This was an Oscar-caliber turn by Mr. Gandolfini. The other performances are on the sides, but Mark Ruffalo, Frank Military, Clifton Collins, and Steve Burton are all great in roles with rich characterization but limited screen time. And Delroy Lindo commands the screen in his brief turn as a General who doesn't even try to hide that he believes every word of Irwin's over Winter's.That's what drives the first 3/4 of THE LAST CASTLE and is very compelling. Unfortunately, 90 minutes of terrific filmmaking are badly undercut by the poor finale. Oh, in a dramatic sense this kind of climax is good, and the final scene is actually good, but the action scenes here are pathetic. There's no clear sense of action, the items the prisoners use are deus ex machina overkill, and the climactic effort (by Ruffalo's helicopter pilot) had me snickering when I should have been enthralled. So it was a mixed bag, but when a movie keeps you going for most of a 2 hours+ length and has such great acting, it gets a positive overall review.Note Some folks have criticized the flag-waving material in the film and said it reeked of hyper-patriotism after 9/11. THE LAST CASTLE finished filming long before 9/11, and the emphasis on the American flag in the plot of this movie is not only appropriate, but intelligent in showing the role of the flag in military leadership. Ironically, the early posters for THE LAST CASTLE featured an upside-down American flag (the distress signal), which were quickly (and also appropriately) changed after 9/11 to ones with Redford's and Gandolfini's faces.

The `castle' is a military prison run by a harsh, ego maniacal warden (James Gandolfini) and it seems bad things are being done to bad people in the name of discipline.  Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) finds himself incarcerated with these reprobates and promptly finds the good in them, ultimately inspiring them to enlist in his noble inmate army to fight for humane prison reform.Once again, Hollywood gets on its soapbox to preach to us about the rights of these fine upstanding violent criminals who are being victimized by society by having to endure the injustices of the penal system, just because they killed, maimed, raped or broke some other really unfair and irrelevant rules.  You see they are really decent guys at heart.This must be a pet cause of Robert Redford's because this is the second prison reform film in which he has starred.  The other was `Brubaker', where a reform minded warden enters the prison population to experience life in the yard, so he can get a prisoner's view of the conditions before he takes command.  Needless to say, he finds them entirely too inhospitable and immediately reforms the prison so they can all become model inmates and future civic leaders.The problem I have with this Hollywood version of reality is that they always make the authority figures evil, corrupt and sadistic, while making the prisoners into pure souls who are just trying to get by while living in these oppressive conditions.  Clearly, in real life the opposite is true, which is why I have major difficulty conjuring up any sympathy for them.The film itself pulls all the right strings, but it is contrived and unrealistic at every turn.  General Irwin's personality is completely different from the background information we have about him.  All the character development about his past indicates a hard boiled career officer. Yet, what we see in prison is a soft spoken, touchy-feely pussycat that sees the good in everyone.  The entire plot to take over the prison is full of improbabilities and incredulities (as if they could be building a makeshift trebuchet without raising suspicion; and prisoners would have easy access to gallons of flammable liquids with which to make Molotov cocktails).  Also laughable is the notion that a guard in a tower, sharpshooter or not, could consistently hit a prisoner in the head with a pump shotgun with rubber bullets and no scope from the standing position at a distance of two to three hundred feet.  How gullible do they believe we are?The acting is excellent and director Rod Lurie keeps the story moving, while drawing us in emotionally to identify with the plight of the prisoners. The action sequences are well done.  This is a technically excellent film that is effective at what intends to do, namely turning the bad guys into heroes and getting us to root them.  Still, not many of the movie-going public fell for it as the film failed to gross even one third of its $60 million budget.This is a good film with na√Øve political subtext and an utterly contrived plot.

It's very far from terrible, but it really is the same old prison movie that we've seen over and over again.  That's not to say that a prison movie that follows the formula can't be good.  The Shawshank Redemption was very good (I know I'm overstating the obvious, but this movie begs the comparison).In Col Winter (Gandolfini) we have the usual overseer of the prison who is a bad guy.  He's a guy that we hate.  He's a guy that doesn't deserve his position.  He's a guy who is drunk on his own power and has lost control of his emotion.  Of course we know this because that's what we're told.  All of those inmates (every last one of them a decent human being) tell us this.  This certainly saves the writer a lot of time.  This way, he or she doesn't have to establish Winter as a bad man through his actions or character development.  Just have some one say it.  This technique is also used in developing the hatred between Winter and Irwin (Redford).  It all happens so quickly (and thank goodness for that, now we can get to the wonderful action sequence at the end).Which brings me to the battle (trust me, I'm not putting any spoilers in here).  We have to remember who the director is.  Rod Lurie did last years' 'The Contender'.  This can't be your typical action scene.  This has to be the thinking man's action scene.  So let's throw some chess references in the movie early on.  That way, we can stage the battle so that the two leads will be caught in a battle of wits where they try to stay one step ahead of the other.  Look out Sundance!  La Fours is right on your tail!  If you honestly wonder who will end up on top, you probably wonder in Rudolph will save Christmas again this year.Finally (and I feel kind of stupid bringing this up) the cinematography in the first half of the movie left a lot to be desired.  The first twenty minutes suffered from a bad case of sweeping camera disease.  The movie is shot in scope, so once the camera does sit still, we have a lot of shots where two characters are at opposite ends of the screen at the same time.  Now there's nothing wrong with that except that when one is in the foreground and one is in the background, one of them is supposed to be out of focus.  Mr. Lurie and director of photography Shelly Johnson seem to feel that having both in focus would be best.  So they shot them both separately and splice them together like it was a kung fu actor playing two roles.  Why can't we just accept the medium of photography?  A film is supposed to look a certain way.  When you change that, it's distracting.  I've seen animated movies where the background is made to look out of focus.  If we can accept it there, why not in real life?

Rated R (for language and violence.)Contains Spoilers There's a degree of artistic license that I'll allow, as long as it's instrumental in forwarding either character or plot development. Former film critic Rod Lurie's The Last Castle is a highly entertaining fluff piece, which he believes, holds a profound and intellectual message. And because the movie takes itself so seriously, I cannot allow myself to ignore the barrage of improbable situations the screenplay presents.Robert Redford plays General Irwin, a highly decorated officer who has been court martialed and arrested for not following orders. He ignorantly ordered a Special Forces unit to infiltrate a foreign drug lair. Nine of his soldiers were brutally murdered. He's sentenced to ten years in a maximum-security prison in the aptly nicknamed Castle, similar to Leavenworth. His poor decision making isn't limited to work, but his personal life as well. On the day he's incarcerated, the daughter he abandoned (Robin Wright-Penn) visits and wishes him the best.Colonel Winters (James Gandolfini) runs the Castle. He's a voracious collector of military garb. His workplace has the appearance more of a museum than that of warden's office. Winters is the unlucky recipient of Gen. Irwin, who says the Army should be naming bases after the man, not sending him here. When the two meet, Winters asks Irwin what he expects from his time. Irwin replies, to do my time and go home. Of course, if that were to happen, it wouldn't have been much of a movie.Nope. Because like Bandits, the good guys are really villains and the evildoers are the heroes. Turns out there's speculation that Winters is corrupt. When there's the occasional uprising, he orders his guards to shoot the inmates with rubber bullets. Now that won't necessarily kill you, except if they hit you in the head. A couple errant shots knocked erstwhile soldiers in the noggins. So the prisoners warn Gen. Irwin about the treatment. Well that's enough to set Irwin off. So he builds an army inside the pen. Because they aren't allowed to refer to each other by rank, or salute, they create a language of non-verbal cues to fool the guards.Prisoner Yates (Mark Ruffalo) initially wanted nothing to do with the mutiny. He had himself a profitable business as a bookmaker, making bets as mundane as predicting the weather, to as malicious as betting on whether Gen. Irwin would commit suicide. Turns out, Yates' father and Irwin were POW's in Hanoi. Together they request Winters to resign. When they're refused, Irwin and Yates construct a battle plan to revolt.Between the plot point I finished with and the closing credits, there are surpluses of unlikely events that make this film a mockery. The prisoners assemble weapons, some of mass destruction like a makeshift catapult that not one guard noticed being built. And when they're not mimicking MacGyver, they're tackling the tanks Winters orders to attack them. Even Blackhawk choppers equipped with enough firepower to annihilate a small town are no match for the supposedly wrongfully imprisoned soldiers.The screenplay is most pathetic when Redford's character uses his fellow inmates as pawns because of his foolishly authoritative behavior. I kept wondering about the men on the front lines of the prison brawl, plenty of which die. And since when did a maximum-security prison become an appropriate landscape for a warzone? Sure Irwin's a general, and mind can overcome matter, but the accumulation of ridiculously scripted events left me shaking my head.What saves this film from simply becoming another Speed is that the actors take the brain dead dialogue and resuscitate it. Robert Redford appeared like an authentic general, uplifting his faulted character past its intended boundaries. James Gandolfini's does a remarkable job in a role that requires him to be a relative weakling despite his stature. However, nobody is better than Mark Ruffalo, who deserves to be a leading man. There's nothing spectacular in his presentation, just the command he has over the other actors is frightening.After loving Lurie's first film The Contender, my expectations were relatively high for The Last Castle. A key differences between the films is that Lurie wrote the script for his former film, and merely directed the latter. Another point to be made is that with a film like this, where the prisoners are the favorites, there truly isn't conclusion that would satisfy everyone. They didn't satisfy me. The Last Castle is only a good movie if you allow yourself to pretend that it's based in a fantasy world. I can't.

Thirdly, the movie is over-predictable the traitor turns a hero after all, the retard will die a hero's, the system will fail to break General Irwin, etc.Being generous, I give this movie 2 out of 10 only because of the well-paced action-scenes in the end (although the end as such is among the worst I have seen).

I finally got that opportunity thanks to HBO.  To say that I was disappointed would be a major understatement.  Where to begin, let's see.  The first thing that one must consider is that this film is set in a military prison.  As a member of the Armed Forces, I can tell you that persons held in a military prison are STILL IN THE MILITARY until they have completed their sentences.  As such, the inmates would be wearing military uniforms, and the last time I checked, do rags and orange skull caps were not part of any uniform that I am aware of.  Secondly, I seriously doubt that a 3 star general would be sentenced to prison in the first place.  If he committed a crime at all, he would probably be forced to retire, go quietly into the sunset and never be heard from again.  Third, let's talk about the character, COL Winter.  (a) I doubt that he would pass the Army Physical Fitness Test or be in compliance with the regulation covering weight control.  (b)  His rank is on the collar of his uniform in the WRONG POSITION!!  The same can be said about his aide, the captain.  The Armed Forces has an office that will assist film makers to ensure that the persons being depicted as being in the Armed Forces are being portrayed accurately.  Obviously, the makers of this film did not bother to consult with them.  I am not sure if the film makers wanted to make a military film or a prison film, but what they would up with was the worst type of film possible, a convoluted hybrid of both that does neither genre justice.   Give this film a DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE!

However, he had admitted his errors and is looking to do his time and go home.  His dignity soon makes him a magnet for the other prisoners.Gandolfini, as the head of the prison, is someone who looks down on all the prisoners, and is a little obsessed in keeping them in control (in an early scene, he deliberately sets up a situation where a fight among two prisoners is assured).  However, with Redford's character now in the jail, the balance of power in the prison slowly moves toward his way, something that Gandolfini tries to fight.  This inevitably leads to the Hollywood-standard prison riot at the end of the movie.The movie has some plot holes (how, for example, did they get all the weapons in a maximum-security prison), but the acting of the two main stars holds up the movie.  Redford plays a very understated officer who is more interested in doing the right thing.  Gandolfini plays the roll of a control freak without going overboard in his acting, which would have been pretty easy (look to Donald Sutherland in `Lock Up' for a good example of how Gandolfini could have gone wrong).The film is nothing that special, but a decent movie to see if it comes on cable.

One of these points I agree upon in that The Last Castle, a story of military prisoners struggling to overthrow their evil oppressor (played by James Tony Soprano Gandolfini), is at times sickeningly patriotic (just wait for the final few moments - eugh). Go American Marines! You rock!! You're the greatest!! etc... But I can forgive that.Firstly the acting is all grand. Now I don't think anybody was particularly troubled by this movie. Robert Redford, playing the lead role of US veteran Irwin, doesn't strain himself nor does Gandolfini playing the oppressor Colonel Winter. None of them shine here but they do what they're paid to do well enough that we can find them believable.The directing is competent. It doesn't stand out but Rod Lurie obviously has no need to be particularly innovative. As is usual the composer Jerry Goldsmith tends to go OTT with the score in a bid to drag us into the movie but, in this case, tending to push us away (such as when Redford moves a big pile of rocks..)The movie's weakest point is David Scarpa's script. It reeks too much of pappish American sentimentalism. The characters come across as mis-treated American veterans rather than the actual criminals they are. The argument is one sided - Gandolfini's character makes some half-decent arguments but they're side-lined by the need to have the characters march all around the place saluting one another (or brushing their hair..). There's too much of this twee glorification and we're-great-aren't-we (witness the sickeningly cloying character of Aguilar) and this element continues right until the *very* end (you're choking at this point as you almost expect a stirring round of the US anthem to start up). The other element of weakness is the revolt by the prisoners which sees them try to take the prison guerilla style. It's amazing how effective they are - they'd give MacGuyver a run for his money as they whip out home-made rocket launchers and other wonderful tools. It's quite unbelievable and also morally unsound in that the convicted-criminals lives are more worthy than the prison guards who they attempt to murder... Criticisms aside the script generally moves along nicely enough and you're never left bored. The lines, which can be a bit hand-on-heart, are for the most part written with enough skill that you're not left laughing.The Last Castle is a decent enough affair. It's biggest flaw is the script and it's need for zealotism, but the acting helps counter-balance this to leave the film just resting above an average flick and thus granting it a grand score of 6/10.

The Last Castle has similar logical inconsistencies driven by Lurie's eagerness to make us see the world from his different, challenging and ultimately fallacious view.Sparing you the plot and the debates over details of accuracy (I have no idea whereabouts an officer places his collar insignia) what I fail to buy is why an obviously intelligent and experienced officer like Irwin (Redford) believes his only strategy is to start a prison riot in order to achieve his objective of removing Winter.His tactics to achieve this, aided by some cinematic license, are impeccable and the most entertaining section of the film resides in his use of variants of classical siege weapons/tactics; catapult, trebuchet and phalanx that surprise and outwit Winter. The ironic message being that although Winter has a fascination with the weaponry of antiquity, he fails to see its true relevance in the field.This can be extruded into a Lurian philosophy - Winter is a banal bureaucrat, a fascist in nature, hell - probably a Republican; whereas Irwin is the romantic hero - flawed but compassionate, patriotic and brilliant. A truly inspiring leader of men. It's liberals taking back their country in the spirit of Jackson and Jefferson.Then what in hell does he expect to achieve with those tactics. His supposed aim is prisoner welfare and dignity, but it is unlikely that taking part in a riot is going to be in any of their individual interests even if they can present a compelling case against the conduct of the governor.In the real world it is inconceivable that the unlawful killings for which Winter is blamed would not be investigated especially with the weight of Irwin's testimony behind it. Yet that avenue is barely explored before Irwin decides to launch a suicidal mutiny against the facility via an extremely dubious and subjective analysis of the army code governing conduct.Irwin would know at this point that even if his plan succeeds, and even if Winter is dismissed, the consequences for himself will be catastrophic. Despite his exterior of calm and equanimity, the sane viewer can only see the revolt develop in terms of recklessness, not courage.The film relies on Winter 'losing it' in the final reel to provide the Manichean cancelling-out of good and evil forces that it needs to avoid being ridiculous. If, as is much more likely, Winter took satisfaction in allowing Irwin to make his typically Liberal gesture of raising the flag, then had him arrested for inciting the riot, the events of the past half hour would be rendered entirely pointless.

From there it is a battle of Type A personalities Redford only wants to 'do his time,' until he understands just how cruel Gandolfini can be, so he begins to take control of the prisoners; and Gandolfini only wants to make Redford know who's in charge.Plenty of corny scenes in this movie -- but the capper is that Redford sees nothing wrong in destroying the prison in order to make his point to Gandolfini that the colonel should resign.

The Last Castle is a good movie until the end. As I was watching The Last Castle I was waiting for the unrealistic parts to come, that I've heard about. And then BAM!!!.less then thirty minutes to go in the film, and they appear. The film was going fine, until the inmates started rioting so the warden would be removed for losing control of the prison. The only reason the inmates made up a plan and carried it out, is to get the warden removed. The inmates knew that the warden could be removed if he lost control of the prison to the inmates. The inmates knew ahead of time the consequences of this plan and they weren't going to be able to escape. Who's to say the new warden wouldn't be as bad or worse then he is. The only thing that was accomplished was both guards and inmates got hurt/injured and some were probably killed. Even more unrealistic, was when the guards that were armed placed their guns down and didn't listen to the warden's order to shot the general if he starts to put the American flag on the flagpole. The warden wanted him to be stopped because he knew that the plan was to put the flag upside down, which means distress. All I have to say about that is, Bull S***. No way in hell would the guards do that. If God appeared and order them to, some of them still wouldn't. They're not going to disobey orders. I don't care who's in that prison making plans for an attack. I don't know if longer sentences are giving for a prison riot, but if so, the prisoners probably received more time on their sentences as well. So pretty much, the inmates accomplished nothing. My final grippe is; why did the warden have to kill the general? He could of shot him in the legs and that would of surly stop him. The general of course, is well respected by other inmates, the warden himself, and probably most guards. He was sent to the prison for ten years for not following orders, and because of that, eight soldiers died. He is the one that starts everything, including the planning for the riot. When everything is said and done people died, especially the general, nobody escaped, the warden was taking away in handcuffs, and everybody saluted the flag, which wasn't placed upside down.

It is the story of the conflict and competition between two strong personalities. Robert Redford stars as General Eugene Irwin, a three star general, who has been imprisoned in The Castle run by Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini) after pleading guilty to disobeying an Executive Order. Winter is a career officer who has never quite won respect as a leader and sees an opportunity to impress his superiors by breaking Irwin. Irwin, on the other hand is held in awe by the other inmates and soon gains their confidence. As a protest to Winter's brutal tactics, he organizes the men in a revolt against the prison. Redford is excellent as the the officer who has accepted his fate but has not forgotten his leadership abilities. Gandolfini is equally as good as the prison warden who tries to out best the Redford character and prove that he is indeed the leader he thinks he is. Also notable in the cast are Mark Ruffalo as Yates, who has come to care only for himself, Delroy Lindo as Winter's superior General Wheeler, who tries to convince Irwin to leave the prison and Steve Burton as Captain Peretz, Winters assistant. There are little gaps of credibility that Director Rod Lurie probably sacrificed for the sake of time, such as how Irwin organizes and trains the inmates and how and where they get the materials for their weapons without being detected.

The face-off between the vindictive, whiny boy turned prison boss, and the stoical, combat hardened general was worth the cost--of money and for withstanding the pervasive jingoism. It was a fresh look at prisons--military prison in fact. Some things are done differently from civilian prisons. The Colonel takes advatage of his wider powers and torments the man he envies, loves, hates (just like he did his Daddy, no doubt.) That the general (R. Redford in his coolest, most noble persona) would proceed to rise in the non-ranks in non-uniform and receive a multitude of non-salutes was inevitable. He's just so tough and cool (like his rougher, sassier, cooler predecessor Luke.) Well OF COURSE there's a final conflict between evil and good, justice and non-justice, and the good general solidifies the worst element of the services into an ensemble for good; fashions a well-tuned fighting unit. And he has a strategy. I loved that totally unbelievable strategy--the catapults, flaming balls, shields and other middle ages paraphanalia because it was, after all, a castle. Some joker, that general. He gave men back their self-respect and dignity, but, even as he lay dying, raising his one true-love, the U.S. flag, he failed to save himself. And he never got to go home and see, Whatshernam, his daughter. Or whatshername, his granddaughter. owver, sempre fi! The greater good was (not) served.

To give you an idea what life is like in prison, the film will always include many conflicting characters heavily disagreeing with the system that put them away.  As a result of that, there's usually a little sense of hope among the prisoners.The one thing that makes The last castle different from other 'prison'-movies, is the fact that the main character *is* truly guilty and knows this too.  In this case, it's Robert Redford who's done a crime and has to go to prison for that.  He's not been set up by anyone else like so much happens.  Also, the main character in this film is given lots of respect by both the warden and other prisoners which leads automatically to a somewhat different kind of atmosphere.  These are the two elements that make The last castle an above-average'-film.The rest is good too, but we've all seen it before.

These days when you can't really just mow down New York Italians dressed as Indians so Hollywood often looks to their own Government. In The Last Castle the government is in the guise of the commandant of a military prison.	In The Last Castle James Gandolfini (The Sopranos, The Mexican) delivers the goods creating Colonel Winter, a sadistic, thin lipped, slippery skinned, never grew up as the baddie, although I thought he might have cheated a little, modelling the character on the Australian Treasurer.	The good guys are the prisoners, the criminals, in keeping with tried and true big business principals. The setting is an old castle which has been turned into a finishing school for the less compliant members of the U.S. military.	Robert Redford plays General Irwin who went against orders. This time this resulted in eight under his command getting killed. But the hoi polloi know his true worth because he's revered by his captors and the prisoners. As is said in the film, `They should have given him a medal instead of sending him to prison.' Now that would have saved a lot of trouble for Colonel Winter.	Winter initially admires Irwin but then hears Irwin belittling Winter because Winter hadn't actually gone into battle. It's true you know. you're no real soldier (or man) you know until you've actually spilt someone else's blood. And of course the use of firearms is almost mandatory.	So the war in the prison is on. It all comes down in the end as to whether the American Flag is going to be raised upside down, the distress signal. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether distress is an appropriate response in the U.S. today.	The Last Castle works well enough within the above guidelines, is reasonably engaging and not overly politically perverse. After all we can't have prisons being badly run by lunatics, and there's nothing better than a well orchestrated rebellion against a despot.3 And A Half Flys Out Of Five  "}{"Title":"good acting but some plot problems","Date":"25 November 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  What can you say about Robert Redford? He's been in a lot of movies and has dabbled in some directing too. I've always liked him as an actor and although the movies he's directed don't always appeal to the masses, they've always appealed to me. They have a beautiful cinematic feel and the storylines are excellent but I'm digressing here. The Last Castle was not directed by Redford but he was the primary character and to make things interesting, he's playing opposite `Mr. Soprano' himself, James Gandolfini. Gandolfini has made a living being a bad character on the popular TV series and he gets to do it again in this movie.The Last Castle is about a well-decorated General (Robert Redford) being convicted for a war crime and sent to a military prison. Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini) is the warden overseeing the prison and is a no nonsense type man. Although General Irwin is convicted of a war crime, he's no less respected and the moment it is made known to Winter that this great war hero is coming to his prison, Winter quickly gets his establishment `cleaned up' and his personal war memorabilia collection polished up to impress this man. Things don't quite turn out the way Winter hopes as General Irwin alludes to the Colonel's collection as a sign of a soldier never having seen combat. This comment basically sets up the remainder of the movie as the two battle wills and wits with ultimately one left standing.The interesting thing about this movie is that there really isn't a `bad' character in it. Gandolfini has refined the art of playing a character that does bad things occasionally but still being likable and he carries that into this movie. Although some of the things his character does can be out right despicable, you find yourself still occasionally rooting for him or at the very least sympathizing with him. Redford's character is likable throughout and he has always had a way of exuding a quiet strength and charm that is difficult to ignore. But this movie seemed to show what a talent Gandolfini is.As much as I liked the performances of the main actors, there were some flaws with this movie&#133;namely some of the plot events. The stunts were interesting but a bit on the ridiculous side and in the context of the characters and the personalities they exude, I'd have a hard time believing that Gandolfini's character would allow a mutiny to occur in his prison. There's one scene where the prisoners were able to build a catapult out of common building materials and essentially use it to bring down the guard towers. Now as interesting a concept as this is, it does sound rather ridiculous and all the more so on the screen. Overall, I liked the movie but there are some plot events that you have to take with a grain of salt. Suspend reality for a bit and you'll enjoy the movie.

I was so pleasantly surprised by TheLast Castle, I'll gladly watch it again.

There aren't those lines which seem spoken just to explain things, just in case the audience isn't following. The ending, for instance, there are many layers there and I kept waiting, expecting one of the inmates to turn to another and explain why the soldiers make the choice that they do. This line, or anything like it, is never spoken. Director Rod Lurie understands visual storytelling. A silent version of Last Castle would get across the same story with little difference. Not that this isn't a great script. I don't remember one bad line.This is also an unconventional take on prison drama because no one's trying to escape. The inmates are all criminals and know it. This brings so much nobility to the characters; this acknowledgment that they have yet to pay their debts to society. But they want to pay this debt as men, not animals. It's a different kind of freedom that they're fighting for. `Last Castle' is about a coup. Colonel Winter is the tyrant that has to be overthrown. Irwin pegs Colonel Winter on never having stepped foot on a battlefield. By rising up against him, Irwin's giving Winter a chance to prove himself and proves which one of them is truly a disgrace to the armed forces.        Lurie himself described this film in EW as being `deeply in love with the military' and it is. It's patriotic film that fits the times. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that footage was added to that scene near the end where many stop and salute the flag.

First of all, expect topnotch performances by the lead and supporting performers.  Robert Redford hasn't acted in a movie, since The Horse Whisperer and I was very impressed by his comeback.  He pulls off the role with the greatest ease.  James Gandolfini was great, too.  Though he played the rat, he wasn't over-the-top, and was creepy in a way that's not in-your-face.  I'm sure Gandolfini felt he was typecast.  Aside from his role as gangster Tony Soprano on The Sopranos, he also played a gangster in The Mexican and basically played the same role in the few other films he's done.  So he dropped his Italian-American New Jersey accent and took on the role of an earnest, but corrupt and egotistical prison warden.  Gandolfini is truly a fine, underrated actor and his role in this movie is proof.  I also have to give it up for Mark Ruffalo, who plays the prison bookie.  I've never seen him in other movies--at least I don't recall--and I think he's a good actor who has the tendency to become a household name with further film roles.The plot is predictable and expectedly melodramatic, but the characters are sharp and likeable.  So you feel for these people as the film goes along, and that's the tool in engaging the audience.  In fact, I was in tears at the end.  Just thinking back to the ending, I'm getting all teary-eyed.  I guess I sort of saw it coming, but when you create characters that the audience builds a good attachment to, that's a key in manipulating their emotions.  And that's what happened, in my case.  I was cheering for the prisoners at the climax.  How often do you feel sympathy for characters in prison, who are guilty of their crimes?  Even the Redford character felt guilty of his actions, which I also found interesting. The Last Castle is nothing deep or philosophical.  It contains elements of prison dramas of the past, but never wears out the cliches.  It stands on its own two feet, and proves to be a good, compelling piece of cinema.

The guards followed his command when their leader surrendered his flag.I, for one, could not keep my eyes off of Captian Peretz.  For a relatively small role, Steve Burton sure made the most of it.

The star of the film for me was Mark Ruffalo as Yates, a rebellious prisoner who is the only person that doesn't fall in line with Irwin's war and instead stays in the back for the most part. He has a huge struggle with his conscience when Winter asks him to be his snitch.

The battle of wills ensues and we are taken to the inevitable uprising as Irwin makes the prisoners proud soldiers again, they unite to depose the commander of the stockade as it were. The final third of the film is well worth the wait, the uprising is thrilling enough, which includes some fine set pieces, and the ending doesn't pander to sickly formula, but other issues weigh the film down. In a film calling for a sadistic Warden you need the actor playing him to be villain supreme, sadly James Gandolfini doesn't cut it, he's more prat villain than nasty villain, whilst his loyal force enforcers are equally none menacing. My other major gripe is having at your disposal a talent like Delroy Lindo and criminally under using him, he lights up the film for the brief screen time he gets. All the others fare OK, nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing that harms the film, Redford fits the part of the ageing and grizzled General, and Mark Ruffalo hints at the great actor he was to become in an integral role in the unfolding plot line, so all in all it's above average and enjoyable fare, 6.5/10.

Irwin (Redford), a revered war hero, is sentenced to 10 years for disobeying orders which led to several deaths of his men. Although Winter is an admirer of Irwin, and he initially plans to treat him with the appropriate respect, he soon starts to detest him as he realizes that Irwin is not willing to accept Winter's cruel ways with the other inmates. As Irwin gradually inspires his fellow prisoners, Winter becomes his lethal enemy, and the question is who will ultimately prevail.The story is interesting, as we watch how a disgraced hero tries and succeeds to restore morality and self-respect to others and himself. Some clich√©s could be absent however, as they produce a sense of deja-vu which could definitely be avoided. Moreover, it would be better if the director was a bit more restrained in his overly patriotic tone, as this spoils this otherwise good film.Redford is very good in his role as always, and so is James Gandolfini. They are both well-fit for their respective roles, and their duel develops perfectly.The Last Castle gets 7/10.

I thought it was a real tear-jerker.However, this movie still sucks because the reasons behind conflict between the prisoners and the prison commandant was very vague and lacked any on-screen justification. Although it is implied that the warden arbitrarily has prisoners killed(with rubber bullets, BTW), it is never made apparent that the prisoners were aware of this or of any unusual abuse.In a deleted scene in the DVD release, they show the villain at his worst... USING UP THE WHOLE GYM while the other prisoners wait outside. Jeeez! They could've at least made the guy out into some evil Nazi-like torture fiend, rather than just another asshole in a uniform. If the prisoners were true American heroes, they would've just put with things and do their duty by serving their time.A word of advice If you ever are in a military prison, put up and serve your time peacefully unless you're ACTUALLY being abused.

Our just-the-facts-Ma'm warden here acts on the premise that 'convicted' means you're purely vermin, and thereby deserve nothing, because justice dictates you should and must be punished, despite all those wrongfully convicted cases that are forever popping up. The system is flawed, yet literalists see only black and white, so can't accept that as even a remote possibility -- Why, what would my Sunday school teacher think if I was sympathetic? So, they played to the heartstrings a little too much to make a point -- that point is still valid! I appreciated the determined cleverness of Irwin's character, the loyalty of his Sergeant-major, but especially Yates' integrity and refusal to go along until convinced, selfishly playing the 'snitch' in the meantime -- all lovable character traits.

What most of the people who are commenting on here on this board don't realize is that this movie is based in a MILITARY PRISON!  It may seem like I'm repeating myself - there's a reason.  Military prisons do not operate under the civilian criminal justice system.  They operate under military law, military regulations, and are governed (as Redford / IRWIN says in the movie) under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ for short).(And in case you think I have rocks in my head, or should have to move the pile of rocks because I don't know what I'm talking about - I have a Masters Degree in Criminology, did an internship in the US Federal Prison in Terre Haute, and was also an officer in the INARNG.)Does anyone recall 'The Dirty Dozen'?  Those guys were all prisoners - yet they took their chances in combat because they were soldiers.  I suspect that most of the people who are making derogatory comments about the prisoners have never served in the military themselves, or they would understand something that we who have do understand.First, we all volunteer to serve in the military - to be soldiers.  Being a soldier is special - because you are what is preventing the barbarians at the gates from pillaging your home (when it's broken down to the basics.) This is taught to every person in every branch of the service - because it's true. Second, if you are in a prison, and you are abusing the prisoners, you should be behind the bars as well.  (Anyone ever heard of human dignity?) Third, men will follow a leader.  (Anyone who doubts that should read up on Theodore Roosevelt and George Patton.  They had lousy personalities outside the service - but they had the ability to lead.)So, what do we have here?  Redford / IRWIN is a 3-star general.  He's survived 6 years in the Hanoi Hilton.  He's led his men into combat numerous times - given orders that have no doubt led to some of their deaths in the past, that's just part of it.  He faces a court-martial for disobeying an order from the president which led to the deaths of 8 of his soldiers.  He accepts the responsibility for this, because as their leader, he caused their deaths, and pleads guilty at his court martial.  He gets to the prison, where Galdonfini / WINTER is the warden.  WINTER has never served in combat - never heard a shot fired in anger.  (Which is entirely possible, given that he's an MP.)  Many of the prisoners have already served with WINTER, during Desert Storm, or had family, such as Ruffalo / YATES, whose father was a POW with WINTER in Vietnam.Apparently a lot of people didn't pay attention - the trebuchet was built from the weight benches.  Easily done, especially if planned in advance. One of the most effective devices for laying siege to a castle - especially since it could throw weights in excess of 500 pounds almost half a mile. And the slingshots - we used to use something similar to that back in college in water balloon fights.  We called them a gazorch - surgical tubing, a funnel between the tubing, two-four strong guys to hold the tubing, and you can send a water balloon 300 yards or more.  (Been there, done that!)Most of the guards knew that ZAMORO was killing the prisoners with headshots with the rubber bullets, and that was wrong.  Why do people think that those guards would have shot WINTER from the towers?  The prisoners had control of the prison - they could have easily maintained that control - but they didn't.  They had already turned control back over the military.  The men on the walls were soldiers, also.  Unlike a regular prison guard, they are not going to follow an order that they believe to be unlawful.  Shooting an unarmed prisoner would have been an unlawful command.  (Goes back to the UCMJ - which is NOT civilian law!)As for Collins / AGUILLAR - don't forget one detail.  He was apparently the only Marine in the prison (which in and of itself was an error - he should have been in a navy prison, not an army one, although I'm not sure if there IS a navy prison anymore).  A Marine, especially a corporal, is going to respect the rank of a 3 star - period.To give you some idea of how the UCMJ works - read Article 99.  Punishment is death, and may be by summary court martial.  Misbehavior before the enemy - so being a coward can get you shot by your own side.  This is without a trial - your commander can be the judge, jury, and executioner - and is perfectly legal.  WINTER was guilty of Article 93 under the UCMJ, the prisoners knew it.  The prisoners themselves could, technically, be subject to Article 94 of the UCMJ, but since IRWIN was leading the prisoners, then he probably would have been the only one punished.Hey, under the UCMJ, you can go to prison for one year for adultery - so all you people out there who think this is a typical prison film just have no idea what you're talking about.10 out of 10 - excellent movie "}{"Title":"Very far from perfect, James Gandolfini and Robert Redford are reasons to see this movie.","Date":"20 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  The Last Castle refers to the military prison, and James Gandolfini plays the king of this castle.

Though James Gandolfini's character tries to remind us thoughout the film that the prisoners are in prison because they are in fact criminals, the film itself will not accept this simple fact, and attempts to make martyrs and paradigms of the American spirit out of violent men.  Redford tells a prisoner who took a claw hammer to his commander's head that since he was a Marine for 2 years, and a violent criminal for '5 seconds' it seems that he is still '98% Marine'. It is this easy dismissal of WHO these people are that begins to undermine the credibility of the plot. Though Gandolfini's character is certainly in the wrong in his actions, his observations that Redford's character wishes to create his own private army, to have a command, and to vainly attempt to lead these 'soldiers' is precisely on the money.  While the film badly wants to convince us that Redford is a truly great man trying to give these criminals worth, pride, and leadership, what it shows us is the fall of what may have been a great man into a pointless, egocentric crusade.  In the end, he of course achieves his tangible goal - but at a price that leaves me asking 'why?', and wondering how the filmmakers could have possibly thought that they had delivered the message they are so desperately trying to deliver. 3/10 "},{"Title":"Every Castle has a king.","Date":"30 March 2002","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Well I went in rather skeptical, but rest a short... this movie... is not boring.

Unfortunately, the movie's lack of character development, cheesy score, unoriginal scenes, and questionable direction leaves the viewer feeling ripped-off and slighted. In comparison to other highly regarded films of the same genre, The Last Castle fails to establish any kind of authentic sense of purpose and comes across as more of a self-aggrandizing Hollywood Blockbuster masking propaganda as American spirit and honor but failing to examine how or why those convictions were established among its characters in the first place.Instead, the viewer is left to assume that the men in military prison are basically good men somehow transformed into criminals by their experiences in the armed forces. And it is the viewers duty to feel sorry for them because they are all being mistreated by the evil prison colonel. Very original huh?Overall, the supporting cast of this movie is very likeable and somewhat memorable and the action (which all takes place during the climax) is solid but not sufficient to save the film from failure.

Come on! That must be a satire on all those flag waving movies!Well I guess The Last Castle is not meant to be ironic, because director Lurie is a West Point graduate. He made a spot for the army - almost as bad as those Marines-recruiting spots which said something like the strong, the brave, the marines. I thought people who still buy that stuff were extinct.Rating 4/10 (3.5 actually but I like Gandolfini) "},{"Title":"A terrible film, in my opinion...","Date":"26 November 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I don't think they could have packed any more clich√©s into this movie if they tried.

The prison warden (James Gandolfini in an Oscar calibre performance) tries to be a moral and orderly figure of authority but unfortunately his high moral ground turns him into a self righteous brute whose ethics go awry all the time believing in what he is doing with the best intentions possible.  Redford has never been a great actor.  Like John Wayne, he seems to play himself in all of his performances but is prepared and knows his routine so he is respectable but he has always been a better director and politician.  James Gandolfini is a very different story.  He upstages the entire cast of this film..... doing a complete turn from his brilliant portrayal of television history's greatest leading dramatic character, that of Tony Soprano on 'The Sopranos'.  Director Rod Lurie, in an encore to 2000's 'The Contender', does a great job here, always working better with his supporting players and he has a free flowing sense of academic style which makes his films believable and highly entertaining.

Some try to sweep it away casually as another prison film, some want to argue the lines are full of clich√©s and one feels sympathy for the warden, Col. Winters because if they're in a prison, they are bad guys in the first place.  Alas, most of these negative reviewers wind up telling us more about themselves than about the film and frankly, I don't really care about them.  No film will please everybody and this effort with some superb acting by Gandolfini, Redford, Lindo and others, works.  No, it's not Stephen King and Redford (who was born the same year as myself) is not over the hill.  This is a fine film with an engaging story that offers several departures from the mainstream of prison films, King's excellent story included.  Redford, a political activists, tends toward films with a statement.  Gandolfini, reunited with Lindo, after the hilarious Get Shorty, is excellent as the warden.  Lindo, who was great in Malcom X, is an often underused talent whose brief time on screen in this film makes us want to see more of him.  Also, wonderful support comes from Cliff Collins, grandson of Mexican character actor Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez and Sam Ball.  Likewise the support of Mark Ruffalo and Steve Burton, TV stars, adds to the texture of this fine screenplay. As for those skeptics who decry the departure from reality that makes up the story, I can only say, if it were true to life, we likely wouldn't have a story.

Unlike the Shawshank Redemption where the principal character (Tim Robbins) is innocent, and his sidekick (Morgan Freeman) has been incarcerated far beyond the merits of his crime, the inmates in The Last Castle are all there for completely legitimate reasons.  We learn that one of them attacked his officer with a claw hammer.  General Irwin (Robert Redford) disobeyed a direct order from the commander-in-chief and consequently forfeited the lives of 8 service people.  Sure, the warden (James Gandolfini) is a career underachiever with a deep-seated grudge for real soldiers.  Sure, he has a certain sadistic predisposition.  But does that justify a prison uprising all to take possession of the flag?  I say no.  General Irwin's entire purpose was to restore self respect to the other inmates and to himself. Couldn't he have accomplished his aims non violently?  Ultimately, Irwin works himself into such a bind that the movie's ending is all too predictable.

When I received the initial invitation for the screening, I read on the paper that it was about a convicted general and his fight with the warden. So needless to say, I went into this movie thinking that it would be more or less another crappy prison movie. Like The Shawshank Redemption meets Attica. Not that those movies are bad, but I was expecting a bad mish mash of the two plots. The other thing that was bugging me was the fact that James Gandolfini was cast in the role of the warden. Now, I have seen almost all of Gandolfini's work, including some of his plays, and I was doubting of his ability to pull off his certain role.Right from the beginning, my doubts of Gandolfini's ability were thrown out of the window. He was able to pull off something completely different from what I was afraid he was going to be typecast as. As for Robert Redford, he was vintage Redford. As I watched, I saw remnants of his roles in `Indecent Proposal', `Sneakers' and `The Sting'. Even more interesting, I had striking flashbacks to Harry in `The Great Escape.' As the movie progressed, I watched in awe at the way that everything was sewn up tight leaving no loose ends.All throughout the movie, I never once got bored or annoyed with the characters or the action unlike other recent movies like say, `15 Minutes' or the grossly treated `Pearl Harbor'.  For once, I was genuinely engrossed in the whole movie.  The characters were sharp; the plot was predictable but damn good in spite of that and the way everything was executed with pinpoint precision.  How refreshing to have a movie experience that doesn't leave you wanting more.I won't go into detail with the specifics of the film, but I will tell you that this is truly deserving of the $9 to see watch it. I also suggest that you go and see this one in the theater and not wait for it to come out on video.  I do apologize if this seems to be a little serving to the movie, but it was good enough to keep me interested and if any of you know me, for a movie to keep me interested, it has to be damn good.

Was that the way we felt before 9/11? You bet it wasn't.  And O.B.L. knew that.  We cruised around in our SUV's, talking on our PCS placing stock trades in our 401k's because we saw an opportunity on the internet via our wireless PDA's.Yes, I'm a flag waiver. But I was one before 9/11.  I am female and I served my country in the U.S Army.  And I understand this movie.  I understand that once a soldier always a soldier.  I understand the principles that make a soldier can never be erased.  I understand that a soldier is both ruthless and kind; duty bound but ethical.  THAT is the message of this movie.Most will miss this because they have been raised not to think about the freedoms they take for granted here in this U.S.  It's not intentional. Americans just have short attention spans.  Every day someone is making a difficult choice on their behalf somewhere in the world.  They don't think about it unless it directly affects them.This movie portrays the 'kind of people' most will never know.  The prisoners portrayed are led by a man very few could ever be.  Only a soldier could understand how and why Redford's General Irwin could or would do the things he did.  Did you connect the dots between suicide and flag raising? Could you imagine the ingenuity of those prisoners to make the weapons they made?  Gutsy of them, wasn't it?  But I find it very possible, very believable.  I knew people like this in my lifetime; flawed, imperfect, and wonderfully human.The reason you didn't like and perhaps didn't understand this movie, dear reader, is because you are not a soldier.  You do not think like, and therefore cannot see the hearts of these men.  But it's the way it's meant to be.  Who would a soldier defend if not for the blind, inattentive, ungrateful and self-serving contingent that they promise to lay down their very lives for?So you say, 'Hey wait!  I LIKED the movie!' Why did you like the movie? You liked the towers exploding, the shattering war trophy case, and the dramatic helicopter scene?  But you didn't understand it, not really.  It wasn't really about all of that.  Those scenes were merely supportive and not climatic. It wasn't really about any personal struggle between the general and the warden.  It was about right and wrong, the weakened and the strong, the forgiving and the vengeful, the human and inhuman behavior of mankind, both captor and captive.Did you understand Aguilera and the bulldozer scene?  Once a marine, always a marine; Semper Fi.  He was not rebelling.  It was just his 'Carpe Diem'. It was his day to be a soldier. It was his day to stand up against the stronger for the weaker.  He stood for what was right. Who can fully understand a marine, but a marine?  Perhaps a soldier could, but never fully.  A marine are a breed apart.  That's why their very job is to be where the fewest men stand the biggest chance of dying.  They say, 'I'll go first'.  Did you get that?  The marine died first, as marines always do.In short, don't just watch this movie.  But, watch it over, over, and over. Pay attention to the beautiful innuendos.  Perhaps, watch it with the soldier of your choice and ask if you don't understand.  Even the worst soldier loves his country.  It's why he became a soldier in the first place. God knows that McDonalds pays a better starting wage than a private gets in the U.S. Marines, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, National Guard, or Air Force airman. And if they joined because McDonalds wouldn't hire them, they won't make it out of basic.Soldiers don't become soldiers unless other soldiers say they are. The reasons there are military prisons is because only soldiers can say that you are not behaving like a soldier should.  And only soldiers are allowed to punish you.  This movie is about the RIGHT of being a soldier.  Did you get the part about the salute?  The warden wasn't a real soldier.  And the other real soldiers let him know it and relieved him of his command.This movie was about soldiers without the 'glory' of the battlefield.  It was about the perfection of the imperfect.

His only wish to do his time, ten years, and then go home. But he finds the warden plays by his own rules to keep his inmates in check. Inmates are given punishments that are in violence of the rules, at best, and unfortunate inmates suffer fatal accidents. To have the warden removed the general must unite his divided inmates to an army capable of taking the prison.Comments Pretty standard prison movie were a battle of mind and body breaks out between an evil warden and a leader in the inmate community. This time it just happen to be in a military prison, with one being a decorated general.It is not very innovative, keeping to a proved recipe. You almost know what you will get at the start of the movie, and I wasn't disappointed. It escalated the conflict slowly but steadily to a great final battle, a good climax. In this way it kept me interested all the way, there was enough suspense all the way.What it didn't use or do, unfortunately, was to use or evolve the unique story of the inmates being in the military. General Irwin's crime was kept secret at first, but that was discarded a little easily halfway in. It could have been interesting to evolve that story, to give the story an edge from the general's background. Something that made him fight, or something that might be a weakness to exploit. Not just discarded. Or could the analogy with the chess game be evolved more? What this movie lacked was the depth of the characters. It hinted at it, in some cases it actually introduced a possible sub-story, but never evolved any of them later.Still it was a little better than I expected. It was quite good for an evening in the sofa.

While the story takes place on only a couple of sets, the film does not want for lots of action, general mayhem and even the occasional murder.

The story is also about a warden vs. prisoner since the three-star general had unwisely mocked the warden by stating that whoever collects any warfare merchandise has never set foot on the battlefield; which I never knew why the general would take the time to say that IN THE WARDEN'S OFFICE! Therefore, the clash between the two begins. SPOILER Positive I literally liked the way how the director portrayed the general's role by inspiring most of his inmates especially the stuttering prisoner; the general defended Aguilar (the stuttering prisoner)because it was illicit to salute to another prisoner. What really grabbed my attention was the ending Redford (the three-star general) has formed a maneuver to overthrow the prison. The warden (who is also the lead cast in the Sapranos) played his part very well.Negative Several parts couldn't be real unless the guards were this ignorant. Number one, a prisoner who was an ex-drill sergeant started shouting to the general prisoners to stand in formation OUTSIDE AT THE OPEN FIELD WHERE THE WARDEN AND THE REST OF THE GUARDS COULD SEE. Even Redford started making a speech out loud! Then the prisoners started to sing the song The Shores of Tripoly. Give me a break! I am still wondering why the general would insult the warden, although the warden was beneficially treating the general. The movie is good and the ending twist is something to wait for. I hope you guys take the chance to watch it, but ignore some of the imaginary plot. After all, it is a movie and movies tend to play with the laws of reality.

Also starring Clifton Collins Jr. as Cpl. Ramon Aguilar, Steve Burton as Capt. Peretz, Paul Calderon as Sgt. Maj. Dellwo, Samuel Ball as Duffy and Robin Wright Penn as Rosalie Irwin. Redford, looking his age, provides a pretty cool leading role, with Gandolfini creating a very good supporting villainous role, with some exciting moments, particularly in the last twenty or so minutes, it is a worthwhile prison thriller. Robert Redford was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good! "},{"Title":"Worst movie ever. Period.","Date":"1 April 2006","Score":"6 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" The title says it all, really.American-o-patriotic & brainless. Stereotypic & inaccurate. An assault on the senses it really treats you as a moron. Not a single scene is believable. Exaggerated. The acting is awful & over-the-top. I am really socked that Redford participated in such a bad movie decay must be unavoidable for all the big stars, as my experience can tell.There is really no point in the plot. The moral lessons are childish and the end makes you think what was all this fuss about? Was all this demolition and cost in lives worth anything? At all? Probably the worst characteristic is that the scenes are illogical and inconsequential continuity is lost within seconds.Avoid at all costs. Worst movie ever. Period. "}]
