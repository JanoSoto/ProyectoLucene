The movies I've seen have been few and far between and while I certainly enjoyed the likes of Ninja Scroll, Akira and Ghost In The Shell, I've never had much urge to seek out a really wide knowledge of the genre. That being said though, Metropolis has to rank as one of my top five films of all time, not just the animated ones.Telling the story of a far future world where humans and robots exist alongside one another, it focuses on the adventures of a Private Investigator and his son visiting the city for the first time and hunting down a missing robot called Tima. And what a city it is! The animation, simply put, is stunning. The epic scope of this vast urban world is beautifully captured on screen. It is richly detailed and lit up like a fantastic world of colour, like a fine piece of dramatic art that has come to life. The animation on the characters meanwhile is no less amazing, it is more akin to French than Japanese in stylistic terms, but is still very detailed and beautifully realised.But this is no piece of aesthetic beauty with nothing to back it up as the storyline is truly gripping. As the boy befriends a young girl, both of them unaware that she is in fact an experimental robot, you find yourself getting swept up in their plight and they have just as much, if not more depth and emotion than any real-life actor's work.Come the climax, you'll be simultaneously thrilled and left emotionally stunned. This is a magnificent film, I can't praise it enough.

Metropolis is one such movie. While most will only give it credit for being a visual masterpiece, Metropolis is a well - rounded work with strong characters, themes and music. Not only does the character design have a fresh and captivating style, each character has his or hers own unique features. The setting is so rich and vibrant at times and dark and mysterious at others, it could only have been created through animation. The use of old western jazz and borderline ragtime music gives the huge city an earthy feeling, which is reflected in the architecture of the lower levels of the city. The themes are classic science fiction themes. I shy away from calling them derivative or repetitive because they still remain some of the most relevant ideas portrayed in any genre. Katsuhiro Otomo's screenplay is understated, contrasting the near in your face visuals. He is one of the most highly regarded writers in the genre, and he shows why here. The chilling ending is a destructive one, but it isn't the apocalyptic disaster some people make it out to be.   The use of Can't stop loving you by Ray Charles frames the scene so well, and I found it far more moving and touching than the ending of Dr. Strangelove, which it is rightfully compared to. So, to all movie lovers, not just anime lovers, I ask you to go see this work of art and let it absorb you and change you. You will be better for it.

It really made me lyrical in a way few anime does - Rintaro and Otomo really has what it takes to make a masterpiece. The blend of charming old-fashioned technology and allusions to modern phenomenons makes it the perfect anime for the beginning of 21st century! Metropolis is based on Tesuka Osamus first manga and later gave inspiration to his more famous Astro Boy. Some story elements and characters from Tesukas later works are clearly inserted in Metropolis to make it work as a movie, which in this case is good... The choice of music is, in my opinion, daring and rather funny; jazzy tunes spiced with hits from the 60s (Ray Charles) sets the tone of the optimistic atomic age. All in all, well made nostalgia...I could go on forever with this rant, so I spare you that if you see this little animated gem! Rent it, buy it, steal it (if necessary ;) , you won't regret it!

Graphically, this movie is indeed a milestone in animation, one that will definitely be referred to over and over in the future. If you are a fan of animation (Japanese or otherwise), you MUST see this movie.As for the story and character - they were somewhat underwhelming.

You learn really nothing about the youthful male protagonist or the female humanoid who he saves and takes care of. They hardly even say a word to each other! There were also some big jumps in the storyline, feeling like a lot of important information was cut out.The movie was based on a long manga, so it's obvious that A LOT of character and story development had to be cut out so that the movie would run at an acceptable running time. I honestly think this story would have worked - it certainly would have been somewhat better - had it been done as a miniseries. Maybe the visuals wouldn't have been so stunning, but a more compelling story and more memorable characters would have made up for it.

Shunsaku Ban is an investigator who came to Japan to find a criminal named Dr. Laughton. He came with his nephew named Kenichi. They don't know the Metrpolis well, so they hired a Detective robot to guide them. In Metropolis world, artificial intelligence has advanced a great deal and robots are seen everywhere performing many different tasks. But they do not have any of the rights that are granted to human beings,in order not to infringe upon human rights, they are not allowed to have human names nor to travel in the zones without permission.Ban and Kenichi discovers that Dr. Laughton was working for Duke Red, one of the main politics of Metropolis city, in a hidden place, creating a super Robot that resembles Duke Red's daughter once lost called Tima.The place suddenly stays on flames and Tima wakes up during the fire and is saved by Kenichi. Dr. Laughton dies shortly after being rescued by Shunsaku but manages to utter a few words regarding a precious notebook of his, which the detective saves from the flames. The movie is full of conspiracies, and one of the main characters in this plan is Rock, Duke Red's adopted son, who discovers his father's plans and decides to destroy the Robot and to kill Dr. Laughton. Rock is strongly against giving powers to Robots (to be honest he hates Robots in general) and he stays the entire anime trying to find Tima, the robot, and Kenichi. Rock is responsible for destroying the place where Dr Laughton worked and why it stayed on flames.Kenichi and Tima become good friends during the movie in a more romantic way.''Metoroporisu'' is a complex anime that actually shows more then people imagine. Definitely is not a movie for kids(( Even looking a little childish), since they probably will not understand the real message of the movie or the scene where Tima is shot in her heart, a metaphor for losing her humanity. o For instance, we see a theme of class struggle in a society full of riches and full of poor people and also the relationship of robots with humans.I am very glad that Rintaro and Katsuhiro Otomo united their forces to bring Metropolis to a film, contradicting Osamu's wish. Many of the scenes of this animation were very well done(like the one the ziggurat is connected to Tima) with great special effects, and the mix of a retro animation with futuristic city had a very nice combination in the product of the movie.I can say for myself that it was a long time since I watched an anime that made me feel touched, and this anime happened to be one of them. The end is very sad, and I don't think that Tima was rebuilt, as many people were speculating, since she was the most complex robot in the world and not easily rebuilt,specially without her creator.

A beautiful rendition of the 1920's Classic Metropolis. This film held breath taking scenes of high technology mixed with the old ways of how people lived in a city called Metropolis, a city full of wonder, crime, robots, and a girl who did not even know she was an android. Yet one boy Kenichi, who is the nephew of a Detective which is in the city to find a corrupt and sinister inventor by the name of Dr. Laughton. and to bring him back to Japan to face charges. Kenichi on the other hand befriends this girl named Tima (android) and together try to outrun a power hungry young man named rock. An orphan who was taken in by the figure head who had the Ziggarat built to keep Tima running things for humans forever. Instead by happenstance, a simple gunshot causes Tima to activate a self defence mechanism which nearly destroys the earth altogether. Through faith and determination, Kenichi tries to get her to remember on when they first met so the inevitable can be ceased. This film held magic in all forms, I loved the way they used old style Jazz music to mix with the confusing high technological world that needs to wake up from itself. Rintaro was brilliant using Ray Charles's song (I Can't Stop Loving You) for the last scene of the Ziggarat coming down like the tower of babel. Beautiful sequences of explosions, grand scale buildings, and just all round clean up of something the world could do without. I am very surprised this film did not get any academy awards for best foreign film, which contained many ingredients that people could actually relate to. A marvel in film making. Especially when it is hand drawn.

When it started I knew this was going to be different; most of the characters didn't look like anime characters, they looked more like characters from western cartoons of the 1930s. This fitted in with the feel of the whole film which was a 1920s/1930s view of the future reminiscent of Fritz Lang's film of the same name.Set in the city state of Metropolis where the robot underclass must stay in their designated areas and a scientist is building a robot that looks like a girl but is destined to run a new skyscraper known as the Ziggurat. Into this city comes a Japanese private detective and his nephew Kenichi who are seeking to arrest the scientist for organ trafficking. The state's de facto leader Duke Red's adopted son Rock is determined to destroy the robot thinking his father is replacing him. Rock starts a fire in the lab. During this the robot is activated and escapes with Kenichi although neither know that she isn't human. Rock continues to hunt them as the flee through the various layers of the city to a climax in the mysterious Ziggurat.I loved the retro feel to the animation along with a sound track that also felt like it was from that time. The use of the song I Can't Stop Loving You during the climactic scene was inspired. Even if you don't normally like animation this is worth watching as it is a good story which is well told.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.

I even liked the weird selection of music because it added a certain charisma to this film that I can't quite explain. I guess you could call the music brilliant by being seemingly inappropriate to what is occurring. The animation was good and was very reminiscent of other android anime like Astro Boy and Kikaider. However, the original Japanese version of this film makes more sense because it doesn't have the weird lack of the picture at the end.

Think of Tintin characters for example - very naive looking characters with primitive animation in 1920s style. The General himself looks like Mario - seriously. He is just laughable. These characters just do not fit to these great looking buildings.The story is absurd and seems to drift without any direction. The characters are not believable at all, they are not just flat, but they do behave in a simply absurd manner. Twists and kills are sudden and hard to follow - you just have no idea why something happened and motivation of characters is totally unclear. The most bizarre is the ten year old hit-man (or whatever he is) who is supposed to work for the Baron but not only ignores his interests but he is basically willing to kill everyone in his way like there is no law applying to him at all. The Baron seems not to have any connection with politics yet he simply builds super weapon and has no problem to test it live on his own without consent of Army or state. More or less it is just a roller-coaster of random yet beautiful scenes.In the end I'm not sure if the authors meant the movie to be full fledged serious cyber punk or just simple movie for the kids. It does not seem to be suitable for neither group. It is just too stupid to be serious scifi fan and too messy and hard to follow for the kids.

It's about a boy who runs across a girl named Tima while investigating a factory with his uncle, and tries to find out who she really is while evading an assassin named Rock and looking for his uncle. Apparently, the director got the idea for this after seeing a poster for the 1927 film, and wrote a manga series about it which eventually turned into a movie.To start my full review, let's talk about the animation. It's incredibly smooth and stylish, and reminded me simultaneously of Mega Man and Ponyo. Every scene is drawn with such attention to detail that there are almost no holes to pick at, and it actually tops most of the Hiyao Miyazaki films in that respect. Besides the traditional animation, there is also a large amount of CGI work. I generally hate it when CGI is used in an otherwise 2D film (especially in Lilo and Stitch), but it combines with the hand-drawn stuff so well that it compliments it rather than clashing with it.Beyond looks, Metropolis also has very solid writing. There are no corny lines, embarrassing moments, or slow scenes. Everything is there for a reason, and none of it feels like it could have been done better. The voice work is wonderfully done as well. Even though all of it is in Japanese, I could tell that it was acted very competently, and succeeds in making it feel like we're hearing the characters talking rather than actors at a microphone.In the end, Metropolis is simply one of the finest pieces of work I've ever seen. It has amazing animation, charging music, convincing voice work, and the most important thing of all heart. If you have any way of seeing this, do it. You won't be sorry.

On top of that, when Tima asks his uncle what she is, she comments that she is just like Kenichi and his uncle makes it a point to say Yes, just like Kenichi almost as if to hint to the audience that maybe he was also a Special robot. After all, his uncle had been tracking down the mad doctor all this time, it is entirely possible that Kenichi was just another victim along the way and adopted by the detective during some pursuit.

The techniques used at the time that it was made were absolutely astounding and it is still astounding to consider the technical achievement that Metropolis represents even these days. This Japanese re-telling of the classic story doesn't follow the plot of the original film, but they are linked due to the way that they both utilise grand settings for their thrills and although it was a lot more impressive in 1927, this version of the story is still a very decent film. I can't say that I'm a big fan of Japanese 'anime', but every time I see a film in it's style I tend to at least enjoy myself, and that can be said of this film. The plot has too many elements to be fully coherent, but it serves its purpose and is always second to the visuals anyway. The story follows two societies; robots and humans, and comes together when a private investigator's nephew meets a robot girl constructed to rule the city. The script is somewhat taught, this may be because of the fact that it has been translated into English, or it may just be a bad script. It doesn't really matter though as, again, the sharp visuals are always enough to distract the viewer from the other areas of the movie. It's almost a shame that this movie isn't better when you consider that it has an absolutely great source of inspiration, but then again you can hardly expect it to rival Fritz Lang's classic. On the whole, I recommend this movie if you've seen Lang's and want some more, but otherwise I just recommend the original classic.

The central theme of both manga and anime is the hubris of Man and his inevitable downfall, symbolized by the fall of the Tower of Babel, as it is in Lang's film.There are also character analogues - Duke Red could be John Fredersen, Dr. Loughton echoes Rotwang, the mad professor, and Tima, created at the behest of Metropolis's ruler, the robot Maria. Beyond this though, any similarities in plot are superficial at best; Rintaro's Metropolis is about a militarized Ziggurat, Duke Red's own Babylonian tower, through which he plans to consolidate his power base. The Ziggurat is designed to be the ultimate weapon, realized by its integration with Tima - a robotic super-human; the tower's 'brain'. This is where the hand of screenwriter and Akira creator Katsuhiro Otomo really shows itself Tima, only human in outward appearance, carries within her a potential for transformation that is far more destructive and all-encompassing than her creators could have imagined.Despite being relatively multi-faceted, however, the story is hardly original, riffing on everything from Tezuka's original Metropolis, Akira, Ghost in the Shell... through to Ghostbusters even (the old Gozerian paradigm). Behind this furious hotchpotch of narrative elements, the film is scored by a strangely ill-fitting Swing Jazz soundtrack (which morphs alarmingly at one point into what can only be described as Jazz Trance). But then there's the visuals - and what visuals they are. A combination of beautifully modelled CGI and hand-drawn cell animation, that reach an apex of immaculate, fluid detail in the destruction of Duke Red's tower; the symbolic liberation of Metropolis. It's a credit to Rintaro that he perceives digital animation as merely another tool in his armoury and does not, as other directors have done, abandon his artistic principles for technology fetishism.

Something about this show makes me feel that he was trying to comment on the social structure and where it's going. It's the natural thing of people in high power pushing down the lower class as they head to the top.Each of the characters that actually have a big part to play in this show actually has nice personalities even though they sometimes fall into a norm. Tezuka always had an interesting way of mixing robots and human characteristics. His robot creations are unlike anything you really ever seen before this time for the most part. They have a playfulness even if the story is supposed to get rather dark. Tezuka always had a reason behind his stories and this is no exception. The story talks about what separates man and machine, what it really means to be human, and all that wonderful stuff.The Artwork is definitely Osamu's style with its large noses and hair that mostly falls over the eyes. Everything about it is rather fun looking and interesting. A lot of characters are strange proportions with rather thick legs, hands about the same size as gloved hands and so on. The colors are mostly bright and colorful even in the darker parts, of the show, the rust pretty much showing up brightly. There is a small feeling that we are looking threw an antic lens at times with some of the grainy feelings it gives off. Sometimes as well, we get a rather panted look for the still images like the face where the hair actually moves about it on a cell. At least, that's what it looks like.The English voices aren't bad for how odd the show is though they play it off sort of like a radio drama. It works perfectly with the feel of the show since it looks like it's from the time of 'War of the Worlds'. The music also plays into that with the 1950's New York attitude. It makes the show a bit more relatable in a sense because it brings the old charms we know and love about a actually city with this new futuristic world that may come soon to us.

Parts of it were excellent, parts of it tolerable, and parts just plain boring. The art was fantastic, and while I liked the cartoon-y style of the characters, something I found a bit odd and disconcerting was that they just didn't stick to one drawing style. Some of the characters had the big shoujo-style eyes, and some had little dots for eyes &#x85; same sort of thing with the hair, clothing and body shapes. Contrast with the super-realism animation style of the backgrounds (which I will admit, were beautifully done) made it all a little odd. The plot was good, but dragged a little &#x85; characterization, again, half and half, some characters (particularly the character of Rock) were excellent, and fascinating. Others were just odd and came off as stupid overly gullible (the leader of the underground resistance, for instance, seemed to be very intelligent, and world-weary, but in other ways was very child-like and gullible.) Other characters acted oddly, and didn't seem to have human-like reactions to things, etc. It seems to me that the villains of the story were much better drawn-up than the protagonists.One of the big make-or-break things for me in a movie is the soundtrack, and this one definitely fell short. I've seen this done before, and I never think it's a good idea to cut out a good emotional score and replace it with a popular song. In this case it was horribly jarring, the placement of a jaunty fifties style swing song over the most dramatic and tear-wrenching moments of the movie all but destroyed the emotion of the moments. So, final verdict is an odd split. About half of this movie was excellent, brilliant, a masterpiece, the other half barely tolerable b- grade anime. I think with some key rewrites, a better score and a little more polishing, it might have gotten the place as a classic that it deserves.

The reason for that is hard to find maybe it lies in the mild presentation of the story or in the too brief romantic relationship between Kenichi and the robotic Tima.------- The director Rintaro's choice for an synthesis of detailed animation of buildings and caricature 40s drawings of the characters, high tech style and old jazz music resulted in a hermetic movie that isn't for everyone's taste, but which deserves at least a second viewing.

A friend of mine who is an anime addict suggested it to me, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch it.  I generally don't like anime.This one started off very interesting... and strange.  It seems that Metropolis, obviously a very huge city with several layers, has made a new ziggurat that is the tip of mankind's ingenius ability.  What this ziggurat is actually for, other than impressing the citizens of the world, we don't really know.It gets a little boring when the detective and his new robot partner begin searching for a crazed scientist performing illegal tasks for numerous people--including Duke Red, mastermind of the new ziggurat.  The newest project involves a robot named Tima.Metropolis was a little predictable in the fact that the boy, Konichi, was stuck with Tima and ended up running from Rock, the orphaned boy who claims to be Duke Red's son.  However predictable, though, it was very entertaining.  Some of the music, such as leaving Fifi's zone, was quite engrossing.A war eventually escalates, but we don't see too much of that.  I was a little disappointed.  But the suspense was kept up, as was the mystery, of Tima's purpose and whether or not she was a good guy or bad.  The final climax is quite hairraising, and I actually found myself saying, They HAVE to make it... they will... will they?The music of Metropolis doesn't really coincide with the movie.  While the movie is based on science and the newer robot generation, you'd expect to hear perhaps some techno (as is very common in anime) or even orchestration.  Instead, the composer took a right turn and used jazz.  It just didn't suit the movie.Character development is poor, but hardly any of the characters were corny.  There were some awkward parts (such as when Konichi tells Tima how to eat), but overall I was satisfied with how the characters spoke and acted.  For once, an anime has understood what humans are REALLY like.Overall, I was very pleased with the way Metropolis was done.  Although not an extremely good movie, it was good nonetheless.

Metropolis (2001) does an amazing job of setting a mood of the situation and explores it well while following the quest of Tima, Kenichi, and his uncle.Metropolis' opening scene, showing joyful celebration and blaring jazz music sets a mood for the soon-to-follow darker scenes, and shows how the city of Metropolis is not what it seems under the skin.  The people of Metropolis coexist with robots, but they do not live peacefully, thanks to the tensions of the unemployed whose jobs were taken by robots, and a secret police that opresses the robot population.  This leads to the main idea of the story.The plot starts with the opening of a huge tower called the Ziggurat by the nice on the exterior but ultimately nefarious Duke Red.  Lauded as a sign of power by the people, Duke Red is setting it up to be ruled by a superhuman robot modeled after his deceased daughter.  This, when found out, will create problems as you will see in the movie.The plot being a bit sketchy in places, this movie is driven by the animation, and its excrutiating attention to detail.  The characters are flawlessly animated, and every scene is stunningly well done. Little things, like people actually moving around normally in a wide-angle shot or the uncle having to flip a page twice because it wouldn't stay put, are not normally seen in anime or any kind of animation.  The jazzy soundtrack is great, and creates a rather interesting contrast to the action on the screen at the climax of the movie.Overall, Metropolis is a great piece of eye candy that is pretty well backed up by the other aspects of the film.

Filled with a 1930's retro/future style but with a distinctly modern sensibility, the combination of both cell shading and computer generated animation techniques gives the movie a very unique ambiance.The city that is at the core of Metropolis is a sprawling mass of commerce and industry that hides it's unstable politics behind massive construction projects and restricts it's malcontents and dissidents to lawless lower levels connected only tenuously with the light filled word above. This is the setting for our protagonists, who enter the stories as investigators tracking a fugitive, but are soon thrown in with murderers, robots, and revolutionaries.Metropolis pleases on several levels. The animation is beautiful and the story is a compelling meditation on the nature of self and mankind's inherent propensity for violence.

The 3D animated visuals are state of the art and the acting is good. The animation isn't as graphic as Akira, but the directing and the music makes it a visual treat. I knew when I heard Katsuhiro Otomo was writing the screenplay, that he wouldn't just write an epic love story, but an epic love story with a hard hitting, slap in the face message.  THE PLOTThe story is about a guy name Duke Red who is a powerful leader with plans to unveil a highly advanced robot named Tima. But Duke Red's violent son Rock distrusts robots, and intends to find and destroy Tima. Lost in the confusing labyrinth beneath Metropolis, Tima is beginning a friendship with the young nephew of a Japanese detective. But when Duke Red separates the two innocents, Tima's life - and the fate of the universe - is dangerously at stake.  The director Rintaro  sticks more to the visuals than to the characters but he stays with the plot and it still turns out great.  I would like to point out that the Message in Metropolis and A.I. is  similar.  The message being, don't create robots and don't misuse this kind of intelligence, or we could be killed.  And above all this is a sacred  story  of love. Metropolis is the new milestone in Anime. It has beauty, power, mystery, and above all... heart. Images from this film will stay with you forever.

There's the three levels--the government, the army (or in this case, Duke Red and his Maldock), and the maltreated rebellious poor--none of whom are right in either movie, and each is brought to some kind of end.  Then there are the outsiders (Kaneda and his biker gang in Akira; Kenichi and his uncle in Metropolis) who end up saving the world from some super-powered being that grows really large, at least for a time (that happened in Otomo's Roujin-Z, as well).  I don't mind the Dr. Strangelove references, though, not even when the filmmakers steal Kubrick's bit--they play nice old music that contrasts satirically with the destruction being shown.The good thing about this movie is that it's far less confusing and cryptic than Akira.Beyond that, I liked the way they made fast-cuts (old fashioned swipes and pinpoints), which kept everything going continuously, though I felt there were times when it was used to cover-over plot points--such as how Kenichi escapes the collapsed building at the end or how he met Atlas and stuff like that.  Very little explained.  It's like Star Wars or those campy serials George Lucas was in love with.Anyway, these aren't damning faults.

The little ads in the LA Times had James Cameron calling it amazing.  The reason I knew I had to see it because it was inspired by the great 1920s silent movie of the same name by the legendary Fritz Lang (a movie my Godfather made me watch numerous times when I was younger).  It took me a while, but I finally saw it this evening over at the Mann's Chinese Theater.Wow.From the beginning, from the very opening credit, the movie sets its sights high and on the right targetEvery great epoch sic deserves a sequel.The opening images invoke the groundbreaking art direction of Lang's film (with an opening shot that's meant to look like the shaky b&w silent film stock).  The rest of the movie takes it step further, bringing the early 1900s vision of the future to life with bleak skyscrapers, steel, sky bridges and dirigibles.  I've never seen animation this artistic and devoted to its source.The new, reinvented story was originally created by Osamu Tezuka (Astro Boy) for his 1949 manga of the same name.  The animation of the characters jumps between Tezuka's light-hearted Astro-Boy style and a style befitting the darker Lang movie, its noticeable but not a distraction -especially to anyone familiar with the Anime style.  I now want to find a copy of the manga, if anything to at least compare the artwork.The storyline also echoes key elements and themes of Lang's film, with Tezuka's storyline giving it more cogency In a great, hyper-industrial and scientific future, robots have become integral to the human lifestyle. The bourgeoisie have realized that the efficient, clean and very loyal robots are much better than the emotional, smelly and revolt-prone proletariat. In the passing years, the rich now live at the top of the enormous urban mountain, with the petty workers crammed into the very bowels of the ancient city -bitter and vindictive.Out of this hierarchy, a rich megalomaniac has created a massive tower (a ziggurat alluding the Tower of Babel) and plots world domination.  He has a renegade scientist create the key for this new civilization a robot-girl that blurs the line of humanity and take the throne of his new world.  A similar female robot was pivot to the original silent movie (again, the new movie creates an identical opening shot).  Yet it's so much more than a simple rehash.Even in this age of CG and ILM there are limitations to what can be believably done on screen.  Animation breaks those limitations by bringing us into a completely new world.  This new Metropolis uses this limitless potential (combined with the cutting edge of animation) to take the story of Lang's film where he could have only dreamed.  Other than the main character, there were no robots in the original, but this new version can explore and create a believable society where they are everywhere.  It creates a whole new level to the movie and its questions about humanity, consciousness, and playing god.  The plot is far more complicated than medium would've allowed Lang, and I'd rather avoid ruining it for you here.But visuals can only do so much for a movie, and director Rintaro (Akira) adds a score that includes classic jazz, techno-jazz and just a pinch of dramatic scoring to give the movie a wholly different feel that most dramatic Anime I've seen (the explosive finale, accompanied by the stark contrast of Ray Charles' I Can't Stop Loving You, struck me as moment of true genius).  I've heard that there's a badly dubbed version of the movie, but I was fortunate enough to have a subtitled version in the theater I saw it in (a major chain, no less).The original Metropolis influenced many of the great sci-fi movies of our time (Blade Runner, Dark City, The Fifth Element). Since many of the Japan's great movies, Akira, Princess Mononoke, and even the original Godzilla involved the struggle of humanity against cold technology it wasn't surprising to see Fritz Lang's film tapped as source material (the original was a response to the industrialization within Germany).  Osamu Tezuka and Rintaro have taken a great cinematic work and reinvented it with a bold, worthy vision.This is the kind of movie Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes wanted to be A great, coherent 'reimagining' of a classic movie -standing tall in it's own right.  One could only wish Fritz Lang could see it too.

In an interview of the crew of Miyazaki Hayao's latest Sen To Chihiro No Kamikakushi, anime was mentioned to have been the term first used by master Tezuka to refer to his over-simplified style of animation. In that sense, Miyazaki's Sen To Chihiro and its intricately animated background was closer to an animation than an anime--as master Tezuka meant it. The new Metropolis and its buzzing background is also an animation--ironically using the anime style of simplified characters which master Tezuka penned. I pray that this movie pioneers in a revolutionary rebirth of nostalgic abstract styles of past generations and marries them to the latest technology and aesthetic standards. This movie functions in the same ways as I.G.Productions' Blood The Last Vampire, it opens a door of infinite possibilities for anime style animations.

I am not talking about the 2001 Final Fantasy CGI film (which has no relation to the FF RPG games' magic, although it is beautiful in it's own way), but the original videogames that you can play on your PlayStation.

The film is true animated magic in every sense of the word.

Dr. Laughton was working with the upper class head of the politics, Duke Red. Who is very wealthy and has a lot of power on the city of Metropolis. He hired Dr. Laughton to create a Super Human Robot that resembles the daughter he lost. When Kenichi got separated with his uncle, he meets a girl who doesn't remember who she is or her past. Kenichi finds himself a new friend, but doesn't realize that his friend is the key to the power of Metropolis.I enjoyed every aspect of this film. One of the cool things about it is the original story was thought up by THE Osamu Tezuka(one of the founding fathers of Japanese comic/anime and creator of Astroboy). Directed by Rintaro(a close friend of Tezuka). And the screenplay was written by Otomo(the dude who made Memories and Steamboy possible).This movie wouldn't of been made if Tezuka were still alive as he disapproved in making a movie on one of his beloved works.

The iris-in-iris-out transitions, that song, I can't stop loving you, laid over the images of destruction, the toonish characters including the expressive, unrealistic robots; all these things are what I loved about the movie. It wasn't ACTION and the PLOT and all that crap. I knew what was going to happen in the end. Metropolis is a movie that reveals to its audience a gorgeous toyland of a city, showing each gear move and pointing out every reason as to why this 1940s child's dream could never work. In the end, I found myself devestated. I'll admit that my mind began to wander a bit during parts, but I suppose I was caught offguard (I was more in the mood for misogynistic action anime). I started to get into the movie a lot, paying attention the backgrounds and foregrounds, in which there is much. The story was definately nothing new, but, because of how it was told, it was devoid of Hollywood cheese. It felt innocent and genuinely sweet.I'd highly recommend this movie for those looking for a gentle but serious-minded cartoon about innocence (Not those looking for a movie with a good plot and good action, crap like that.)

The animation is an adaptation of the earlier works of late manga artist Osamu Tezuka.Speaking of the animation quality, the marriage of CG and cel animation could not have been more complete. In the context of the direction toward which Japanimation has been evolving for some time, it seems that CG generated backgrounds with cel animation that depicts foreground and characters are the norm. The CG backgrounds also use the extensive application of cel shading to allow the sprites of hand drawn animation to blend with them almost seamlessly. The technical aspect of animation rivals any animation feature released recently in terms of polish. The details of the city of Ziggurat are very diverse and intricate, all of which are evident in the final sequence of the film.The character design is reminiscent of Tezuka's works, and they are animated superbly, although too simplistic for my tastes. But that is but a minor qualm.What Metropolis lacks is not in the animation department, but in plot and character development. The characters are generally given stock personality and some motivations of the characters are either lost in translation or flatly assumed. The several points of the plot are left hanging (such as the revelation of relationship between Duke Red and Tima; the role of the government and its titular relationship with Japan; the significance of the Dr. Laughton's notebook), and some blatant assumptions are required on the part of the viewer to even make heads or tails of some sequences to maintain realism and interest. The pacing of the plot does not help compensating for aforementioned problems either. For example, the plot dealing with the 'revolution' was very scant and its pace too deliberate. Don't ask me about the general theme of the plot. The robot's plaintive 'Who am I? Am I a human?' tripe has gained another lease of credibility in this movie, and I am not really excited about discussing that.Another note the music theme is consisted of many derivations of one single piece. Some insertions of other works were notable, but some of the adopted scores were just misplaced and left wandering. Obviously striving for that formula that made the end sequence for Dr.Strangelove unforgettable, what Metropolis ended up doing is to remind me of how that sequence by Kubrick was so impeccably executed and how it was rather inexplicably misplaced and arbitrary in this movie.Whether my general disappointment is because of the translation is out of the question. Nonetheless, Metropolis is a mediocre action flick with a carefully guised pretense of meaningful depth. It does not succeed in providing either in a satisfactory manner. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Fritz Lang anime...","Date":"29 May 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama","Review":" As visually elegant as anything Miyazaki has ever done, Osamu Tezuka's METROPOLIS is as thoughtful as the best of Otomo (whose DOMU would likewise make a great anime).

But it just wasn't as good as other anime feature films I've seen. The emphasis was on the destruction, with all the explosions, etc. As a result, the plot was compromised. Even the subplot of Atlas's revolution is basically a carbon copy of revolution plots in other films. I haven't really seen many anime feature films, but I've seen enough to judge this one by. Metropolis just doesn't have the high stakes plots of the three Tenchi Muyo feature films, which I've seen, or of Beautiful Dreamer, the second Urusei Yatsura film, which I also saw. Neither does it have the exquisite animation and riveting plot of the film masterpieces of famous Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, known for his films Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, and Kiki's Delivery Service, to name a few. His plots really bring you into the story, and you feel as if you are with the characters when you see his animation. It's wonderful.

The strange and intriguing thing about the film is that there is a sort of daliance with multiple themes from other films that never quite go anywhere the marxist angle from the original Metropolis is here; with the final destruction of the ziggurat (no, I won't bother to look up the spelling) and the concomitant eruption of pop music we get an ironic (and wholly inappropriate) ending a la Strangelove and of course all of the freudian overtones; with the robot's identity confusion a little bit of Bladerunner creeps in.

I also felt that the storyline was strong and more accessible than most anime.Having said that, I really didn't like the combination of 3D backgrounds with cell animation. I'm surprised to see that only one other reviewer (Katherine Thompson) agrees with me on this point. I see this as a really disturbing trend in anime and I'm concerned that soon all animated features will be using this technique.The first movie I saw that made obvious use of 3D CG techniques blended with cell animation was The Iron Giant. At the time, I thought it was an interesting experiment that obviously had problems and was either going to get better or never be used again. Unfortunately it appears that its use is now widespread and none of the problems have been fixed. Although having said that, Ghost in the Shell (which of course predates The Iron Giant) also uses quite a lot of CG but it is done so well that it just adds to the beauty of the cell animation. I think the main difference is that the CG in Ghost in the Shell doesn't have that shiny, rendered look like the CG in Metropolis and Titan AE.I'm just thankful that Miyazaki's movies are free of this technique. Although I haven't heard much about Sen To Chihiro No Kamikakushi, please don't let it too have shiny CG backgrounds.I also didn't like the style used to draw the characters. Every time I saw the uncle I was irritatingly reminded of the old man on the box of the Monopoly board game (he also reminds me of one of the Super Mario Brothers). I know the style of the characters was a conscious decision of the movie's creators and was probably meant to be reminiscent of Tezuka's original manga, but I felt it was the one retro design treatment that I didn't find convincing. I think such abstract looking characters didn't belong in such realistic environments and it didn't add to the old-fashioned/high-technology design theme that otherwise worked very well. I prefer the squared-off, hyper-real look of characters in movies like Ghost in the Shell.Finally, the print I saw had very poor subtitles, that seemed to suffer from some sort of dithering problem when rendered over the top of white backgrounds.

Plop your money down for special effects and design, and you're there. And so we've seen Planet of the Apes and Sleepy Hollow and The Fifth Element and Pearl Harbor and Godzilla and Star Wars the Phantom Menace and even the original cut of Blade Runner.Yes, the images are great--but is there anything in the films themselves you can't get from a coffee-table book about them? Yes, the craft that goes into them is impressive--but is there any character you remember or care for?Metropolis is a bit better, because it has a thoughtful side, concerning whether a machine can love, or feel. And two of the characters, at least, make you care.It's based on an old Japanese manga which was inspired by Fritz Lang's silent masterpiece, Metropolis. It retains some of the images from that earlier film, and some of the same characters, but they're elaborated here in different ways, refracted through a Japanese perspective.The director boldy steals from other sources in ways that make you consider it more than your average HSLC movie. The music is 1930's and 1940's swing, several images could have been traced out of Miyazaki's Laputa, and the juxtaposition of Catastrophic Ending(tm) (you just *knew* a Japanese anime was going to end in Catastrophic Ending(tm), didn't you?) with an upbeat song seems designed to remind you of the bombs going off in Dr. Strangelove with Vera Lynn sing We'll Meet Again.But you do have the two central characters who make an impression, a young couple thrown together by circumstance who come to care for each other. Despite how cliched the idea is, it is done subtly and well here, and you believe it.One of the couple is a boy, Kenichi, who seems at first to be the comic relief, but turns out to be the hero. His great strength is his complete guilelessness, and complete emotional honesty. The other is Tima, a half-human android designed to run a complex weapon system, who is split between her machine and human sides.Unfortunately, the interesting story about Tima and Kenichi is never really emotionally resolved--the great images and the Catastrophic Ending(tm) overtake them.It is beautiful and worth a look, particularly on a big screen, but its maker could have made a greater film if he'd paid less attention to the images, and more to Tima and Kenichi.

The film's first half an hour goes by just marveling at the amazing imagery.Sadly, the film soon falls victim to it's own visual gorgeousness. Too many scenes in Metropolis have no other function than to portrait the namesake city. In a movie of this magnitude the story and the characters  are secondary to the scenery. Sure, the plot is more complex and the characters more interesting than in your run-of-the-mill anime. The script actually touches many topics explored by earlier dystopian sci-fi, but it hasn't got anything new or particularly interesting to say. The film tries to be deeper than it actually is, so when the hyper-dramatic finale is over, the viewer can only respect the creators visual imagination, not their intellect.Another flaw in the script, based on an original comic by Osamu Tezaki and penned by manga and anime legend Katsuhiro Otomo, is that it borrows too much from other science fiction. The setting is straight from the original Metropolis, the basic concept pays a strong resemblance to Blade  Runner, and the ending echos Yukito Kishiro's Battle Angel Alita, Otomo's own Akira, as well as Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. There's nothing wrong in paying homage to one's sources of inspiration, but enough is enough.Still, I can't deny liking the film.

I found the 3D elements sort of lacking (given the fact that its a cinema release), but still eye-pleasing.Metropolis looks simply gorgeous in every single shot. (like Blade Runner in blaring colours or Midgar in FinalFantasyVII(the game, not the movie)).The storyline is OK. Nothing too grand, and more of the been there more'n once, seen it-sort, but its still solid and carries the movie. Still, it was sort of predictable the whole way through. They could have done with a little less pathos, too. (come now, the most advanced robot that's ever been has a human shaped heart and it stops beating when the robot loses its humanity??? ...please...)The soundtrack is eerily fitting and, as someone wrote before me, I will probably always remember the final scenes of the movie because they absolutely nailed the music there.Now to the angry factor. I know it's a classic, and all the hardcore fanbase would have screamed in agony, but the character design is just grossly misplaced (to put it mildly), for this kind of movie. It's like Sin City would be drawn by Albert Uderzo. Storyline and Art just don't match. While Kenichi and Tima are not too bad (as they are kids), everyone else just falls out of the background. That duke for example. Or the detective. Every time they were on screen I got ripped out of an otherwise consistent world. You just shouldn't mix a serious story with visual oddballs. Look at the Ghost in the Shell-movies. They pretty much kicked Shirows Manga Designs into the can and went for a more realistic approach. What did we get? A more believable world.Well, this single fact pretty much ruined a lot of the fun this movie could have been for me. If you don't care about that (watch the trailer first), you're in for an above average piece of anime.

Personally, I dislike the use of 3D with 2D animation. It causes a film to lose its hand-crafted quality and is often too smooth and sticks out a mile. It is a trend that has developed a bit too quickly from convenience and adds very little to the experience - see any recent Disney film. The 3D scenes in this film not only jars with the 2D cel animation, but is also very primitive compared to other recent 3D animation. The camera moves are rigid, the modelling basic and the lighting bland. Compared to the exquisite watercolour images from various select scenes in the film, they seem to have been spliced in from an early animatic. Only the beautiful image of a dawn over the rooftops of the underworld (seen on a rather misleading ad poster) make up for this disappointment.Then the film begins and more problems surface. The characters are as 2D as their construction. The storyline is scarcely credible and seems more concerned with theme and philosophy than drama. I found myself wondering what was the point in creating a very advanced robot that thinks it's human to sit on a chair in a high tower and rule the world. Talk about pointlessly elaborate. Not one of the characters seemed able to explain their function and therefore any tension that might have been developed vanished as soon as more 'pretty' graphics appeared.No, for a film written, produced and directed by such masters, you would expect something more than this. There was no pace and no sense of emotion. Even the filmmakers on the DVD seemed more interested in their work of 'art' and technology than the audience that had to watch it.Why did Duke Red go to such lengths to rule the world? Why not just build a big computer or an army rather than a huge building to do something weird (and then never referred to again) with the sun? Even Bond villains don't have schemes this outlandish and intricate. Why does he make a robot to rule the world when he hates robots and has an army that seeks out and destroys them? And why did it have to resort to that final cliche of grand destruction? Hmm. I also found it surprising that no mention was made of the original film on the DVD, even in the production notes. The original film was about class structure, the new age of mass production and exploitation. This film seems to have been written after looking at a few choice clips and incorporating its 'style'.Despite appearances, it's completely 1D 3/10 (for some nice painting)  "},{"Title":"Spectacular backgrounds to superficial foreground","Date":"9 January 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  Anime is tantalizing. Its differences from its western counterparts are refreshing - the mythical themes, the slow tempo in the development of the story, the frequent focus on poetic moments or small scenes of peripheral importance to the story, and so on. Simply different, yet familiar in essence. One can still relate.Metropolis is a big anime production with spectacular backgrounds an effects, but the characters and the story they go through can not measure up to that background. The impressive scenery takes over the lead, and keeps it - all through the grand finale.The elements of the plot are easily recognized from a majority of anime films, especially the character who is unaware of his or her enormous inner potential and great destiny awaiting. Such a character is just about obligatory in anime, and one could elaborate on why. In this film it's a girl robot - of a very special kind - who is unaware of being a robot, and very reluctant to accept it.There is a love story, a rather childish one, between her and a human boy. Sort of beauty and the beast, or for that matter Romeo and Juliet. Unfortunately, it is not explored at any depth, though it would have made the movie much more interesting at length.Then there's also the Metropolis concept of a higher and a lower world, references to Dr Strangelove, and what not. A wonderful mixture of mythical and symbolical classics of the west, seen through Japanese eyes. That's all there, in the background. So the lack of foreground, of characterization and its development, is not that crucial.

The style of the characters don't work very well with the 3D backgrounds, even though the blend between 2D and 3D itself is seamless. A lot would have been gained by paying less attention to Tezuka's original style in favour of a more contemporary way of drawing.Much worse is the choice of music though, the kind of 20s jazz used throughout the film doesn't work *at all* with the futuristic and grandiose settings. This never becomes as clear as during the climax of the film, when Rock blows the tower up and Tima falls to her death, all to the tones of a bloody Ray Charles jazz-ballad. The climax immediately turns into an anti-climax.This is overall the main flaw with the movie; the director's insistence on making everything as twenties as possible, even when it comes to its polar opposites. On the one hand the 20s nightlife clichés the jazz, cabaret and variety shows, on the other the megalomaniac and modernistic projects aiming to build a new and perfect society. It's like trying to imagine Mussolini at a Josephine Baker show. It doesn't work.There's also quite a few problems with the characterisation of most of the characters (except perhaps Tima), we just never find out enough about what really drives and motivates these people.Which is all a shame, because this COULD have been really good, the film is (with the above objections in mind) visually stunning, and if they had fleshed out the characters a bit more the plot would have been a lot more intriguing. Oh well. Guess nothing will ever match Akira...

The tell-tale wierd hair and art style that is reminiscent of Tin-Tin and Archie really shows that the art that this animé was based on was drawn a long time ago... in this case 1947-49.Now, when I watch a cell-shaded animation I prefer it to look like it has been painted. In this day and age it has, of course, fallen to computers to make the production of animated shows a profitable venture. However, just because we have computers as the tools I don't necessarily think that we should be making our backgrounds shiny and 3D rendered.This is all I saw here. The combination of pretty 3D rendered backgrounds with cell-shaded characters grates against my sensibilities. This detracts from the overall production and distracts me from the plot. I feel that it looks hotchpotched and amateurish. I feel that some directors are relying too heavily on computers and not enough on good animation.Some people seem to think that computer graphics are the way of the future in animé. I feel that productions such as Shrek and other CG masterpieces are as far from the animé form as other regular films, and animé doesn't need to go there.Metropolis had a really nice plot, though it is amusing to note that it is very different from its original form in the manga. It is as different in film as any movie adaptation from a novel... possibly more so.I may watch it again... but it might be a while before I bother.

The story did not seem realistic or interesting in any way, I kept thinking Oh god, there just MUST be something more around the corner. There wasn't.Frankly, if you are really into animation and CGI you might want to check it out for the technical standpoint.

I hated everything in it, from the atrocious soundtrack to the cheesy visuals ; but most of all it was the lack of character development and the very long useless scenes that bored me.I found the characters shallow and uninteresting ; stereotypes in which I felt no inner life, no feelings, which is quite a bad point for a film which pretends to get interested about the nature of humanity.The plot is very thin too. Of course this is a remake of a very old movie. I feel this remake thing acts as a kind of trap for filmmakers ; it should be an occasion to build new ideas on an old theme, but it ends up restricting ideas. Ghost in the Shell; for instance, is a true masterpiece on the subject of man vs machine, and it did not need to copy any previous work.The ideas expressed in Metropolis are weak. Fritz Lang's Metropolis was much more political, much more disturbing, and it was many years ago.The visuals are very cheezy IMHO. Of course this is a decision from the filmmakers ; but it is not because they wanted to respect the original fritz lang esthetics that they had to put horribly fake CG stuff everywhere, like the big rotating gears, the fans, etc.Lang created a very perversely designed factory where the workers would spend their workdays running endlessly and senselessly. This was politic speech materialized into the sets. Here we get plenty of elements which were put here becaused it looked nice to put some rotating gears in the background. Give me a break...I think this movie is the Japanese equivalent of bad american cartoons like Disney does. Japanese animation movies (like Miyazaki's) have a strength that sets them apart and blasts away the old cartoon vs real film distinction. However, Metropolis is really just a cartoon, with a big budget and well animated, but it has neither brains nor heart.In the end it is as pretentious as the Duke's attempt.

But these days so many crap are out there that makes me value Miyazaki movie so much. At least he tell a good story. I want to like this movie. I really really hope it will be good. But at the end I was let down once again.The director, Rintaro, have no sense of story telling. Almost every scene ended abruptly without any elaboration of what the purpose is. The fade in/out is really being abused here.He could have use screen time to elaborate on the motives and background of various characters. Instead the film chose to explore everything in the world just a bit, then moved on to other areas. You think the story sucks? How about another far shot of some beautiful building in the mecha-city? About halfway through the movie suddenly everybody have a name. The robot is Fifi and Tima. Duh? Where that come from? Nothing make sense in this story. Who are the protagonists? Why do the police department send a COP to assist them in the story? Why does the old man reporter know so much about kung fu and computer engineering? What does the Dude Red want from the girl? Why make the girl robot at all? Who is Rocky? Why do Rocky hate robot? Did the robot rise up in rebellion at the end or not? The movie provide no answer to any of these questions. There are a lot of great ideas. I just wish the filmmaker will string them together into a story, instead of doing all the exposition in one stage where all the main character happen to stumble all into it. There you go, another samurai style scene with everyone laid down heroic dialogs without conveying any feeling in it.Oh one last gripe THe voice acting of Keiichi and the girl is just atrocious. I have no problem believing they are some relative of the producers who want to take a dip in the voice acting business.Otomo is a great manga artist, but his script sufferers from a lack of logic and lousy pacing. You want an example of bad scene? How about the angry mob waiting to confront 1 robot cop QUIETLY? They actually waited several minutes for the leader to explain to Mr.Robocop why they are rebelling before going nuts. Also one must remember NOT to put security guard outside your captured robot girl's room, so that she can escape with the made in a jiffy.Stop it Katsuhiro. Please draw more manga and let other more talented people write for anime movies.Also what's up with the obsession for the wiping out city Gozilla style? Just when i was wondering if this will be yet another anime that ends with the totally annihilation of Mega Tokyo, there it happen again. I guess Otomo runs out of ideas to how to bring it on that he actually put inside the huge building a SELF DESTRUCT button for the main villain to access.Brilliant.

But, while viewing the amazingly lush and detailed artwork of Metropolis, I began to feel a cold sense of indifference towards the characters and story line.  If the creators of Metropolis had redirected just a few ergs of energy away from the animation process and put it towards creating equally impressive plot elements, I belive Metropolis would be a masterpiece.While the concept of Metropolis is derivative of much Sci-Fi genre, the story has merit. The weakness of this movie is the need for the viewer to connect scenes together in their mind with story elements that lack any details. Basic information is provided so that the story has a framework and events can take place, but the viewer has to place their trust in this information because once a plot element is introduced, no further development of the idea takes place. I got a feeling of 'as it is written, so shall it be,' so don't question anything. The problem is I have questions. Why doesn't Rock let Dr. Laughton run off with Tima as the Dr. plans on doing (surely Rock overheard this, but then the story would end)? Why, if Rock is such a tough-guy, can he manage to blow-up the lab, but not kill Tima or the Dr. with his gun? What exactly did Duke Red do to gain such power? Is he an industrialist? Did he buy his way into public attention? When Rock and Uncle return to Zone 1 after the rebellion is put down, why does everything look normal and we don't see any carnage? Why are Kenichi and his uncle needed in the throne room when Duke Red reveals his plot? Exactly how will Tima's powers manifest themselves? Why does Kenichi insist on saving Tima now that he knows she's a robot and she is trying to kill him(we have to assume that they love each other, but given no reason why)?Metropolis makes a weak attempt at being a morality play. We are told that robots in this society are hated and to prove this point we learn of a 'fascist' group called the Malduks whose only existence seems to be to kill robots as violently as possible. The public being saved from robot 'tyranny' don't seem unhappy with the robots in their society or concerned when they are put in harms way when the Malduks execute 'bots with extreme prejudice. We also learn of a group of people living in Zone 1, an underground society for people displaced by robot labor, that eventually rebels against the upper society.  Zone 1 is described as being filled with hardship and suffering, yet seems to be a happy place to live.  If a statement about class struggle and the right to exist is being made, I don't see it. The people and robots of this world are faceless masses used to push the story along.Finally coincidence is also used in lieu of plot to push the story along. Why would five separate parties (Kenichi and Tima, Uncle, Atlas the rebel, Rock, and Duke Red) meet at one spot in such a metropolis? My answer is lazy or uninspired writers.Rating 2 (10 for animation, -8 for story).
