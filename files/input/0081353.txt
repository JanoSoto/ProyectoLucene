I guess I can see why. It's so idiosyncratic, so loose, so out there, so...Altman. But this is truly one of the sweetest, gentlest, and most tender movies I have ever seen. This movie can be enjoyed if for no other reason than for its total lack of irony. Like Popeye, it is what it is. And I believe it to be a masterpiece. This was Robin Williams first serious movie role (2 full years before Garp) and he is a brilliant Popeye. He brings so much humanity and pathos to this character that it is easy to see the great movies in his future. Shelly Duval was born to play Olive Oyl and she does not squander the role of a lifetime. And in a smaller role, a standout performance is turned in Bill Irwin as Ham, Olive's bumbling, stumbling, clown of an ex-boyfriend. The real star of the show, however, is the atmosphere that Altman conjures up, bringing the 2d comic strip vividly to life and setting you down in this magical little island town of Sweet Haven. Harry Nilssons score is pitch perfect and his songs help to sketch out the characters motives and emotions (He Needs Me, sung by Duvall, is currently being revived thanks to it's being prominently featured in PT Anderson's Punch Drunk Love). One more thing about this movie- I can watch it with my three year old son and we sing the songs and both enjoy it immensely. There are so few movies that can do that. Like I said, a masterpiece!

I never get tired of watching this warm, visceral musical that pulls me in with its myriad textures, striking colors, and unpredictable pacing and dialogue which never seems contrived or scripted (and of course was often expertly improvised). It is the unfettered antithesis to all the shiny, over-produced media of our age. No pretty faces. No product placements. No feel of a commercialized film crafted to be anything other than a comedy musical adaptation of one of my favorite comic strips. It adapts the world of E.C. Daily's style, before King Features cleaned it up for animation. Disjointed, rambling...borderline insane, just like the comic! And the music is bonus all the way through. Quirky, playful, simple numbers that perfectly reflect the feel of the old comic. But then again, I liked Hudson Hawk and the Forbidden Zone, so you probably don't want to listen to me. I'm not holding my breath for a commentary-loaded SE DVD.

It corresponded to DuVal's breakdown, and was all but the end of the heavy drinker Nilsson's adventures in film. But I think its great. You have to remember that it predates every comic/cartoon to film project except 'Superman,' which really was a version of the TeeVee show. And you have to appreciate that 'Popeye' the cartoon is one of the very few that featured humans and therefore was more abstract than most.Watch it now, and see that it was well ahead of its time and now stacks up as extremely introspective along the lines of 'Alphaville.'It had Robin Williams and Ray Walston, both famous TeeVee aliens, or so they were known at the time. It was penned by the notoriously ironic, cartoonist Feiffer, someone who specialized in personal social angst. The songs - a major element here - were by the self-destructive genius Nilsson, and directed by Altman when he was interested in social commentary.All, plus Duvall, were at the height of their powers. Even the quirky Van Dyke Parks appears.What makes this project so interesting and appealing is that everyone is completely simpatico with Feiffer's Jarryesque vision, which is disconnected from reality and had no cinematic model.How so many talents could be so adventuresome and coordinated at the same time is a real puzzle.The bit about how 'large' Bluto is - and how Shelly mentions it - makes me smile every time I recall it. The social text is a bit heavy, but so what?This is what made Tim Burton possible.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

Altman took obvious care in bringing the town of Sweethaven and its residents to life . . . notice the bustling activity, the individual characterizations, and even the big, cartoony special effects (e.g. - Bluto blowing smoke from his ears) that both pay homage to the original Popeye and separate it as a new direction for the story.This well-known story is brought to life by the actors in it, most notably Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl.  Robin Williams, complete with immense forearms and squinting eyes, gruffly plows through his adventures with the same tough sensitivity we've come to love from the character over the years.  And Shelley Duvall . . . is simply astounding.  She BECOMES Olive Oyl.  Her gestures, her speech patterns, her gliding walk . . . it has to be seen!  Duvall literally transforms herself into a living cartoon, one we care about more and more as the picture runs its course.Popeye is a great conversion, from the comic strip to cartoon to film.

I liked this motion picture since its release and just as someone else mentions here, I sit and watch it again whenever it's playing on television. I was a fan of Popeye's cartoons when a kid, and as a grown up I have become an indeclinable admirer of the films of Robert Altman, who I consider one of the greatest directors of American cinema. As someone wrote in a review of Dr T. & the Women, Altman is a genre by himself. One may go to see an Altman comedy, but it is better to be warned that one must emphasize the director's name instead of the genre. This is indeed a film version of a comic-strip character, but I believe Popeye is mainly Altman's (and writer-cartoonist Jules Feiffer's) vision of Utopia in a town by the sea called Sweethaven, where Flags are waving wet people from the sea, safe from democracy, sweeter than a melon tree (lyrics to Sweethaven, an anthem by Harry Nilsson). It is a love postcard from the filmmaker to his fellow Americans, who so far have preferred to follow the critics' failed opinions about his work, or his peers' disdain when the time comes to give out awards. And then Sweethaven is also more than that it is Altman's surrealistic vision of humanity dealing with its basic emotions and needs. For the recreation of a world where God must love us (Op. cit.), Wolf Kroeger created marvelous sets in Malta, photographed by Giuseppe Rotunno (the magician of light who captured so many of Fellini's clowns and buffoons), peopled with a cast giving its best and to the rhythm of simple, sweet and affectionate songs by Nilsson, that seem more than appropriate for this universe --I do not agree with negative opinions about the songs they are in complete atonement with the spirit of the film and cartoons. (Do you remember Olive singing I Want a Clean, Shaven Man?) What I find disturbing about the film is its sudden change of mood, from observation of people's strength and foibles, into an action movie. It makes me wonder if Popeye was severely cut by its distributors. In the soundtrack album, there are songs never heard in the movie. It would be great to see a restored version of Popeye. But there are many wonderful things about it as it is, that I can pass the deficiencies. For example, one of my favorite scenes is Popeye's first dinner with the Oyls it is pure Altman, with overlapping dialogues and his brand of humor all over the place. Then you have the whole engagement sequence, with Olive escaping from home as she sings He's Large, meeting Popeye and finding Swee'pea, while Bluto destroys her house. All the humanity contained in the cartoonish frame makes me love this film. I just can't help it.

His use of naturalistic, overlapping and mumbled speech patterns, used to such good effect in M*A*S*H, is the perfect fit for the residents of the shanty town of Sweethaven. Along with his production crew, he expertly reconstructs the environs and  reanimates the zany spirit of the early black and white Popeye cartoons, the ones before Popeye was cleaned up and turned into a tool of U.S. war propaganda. Robin Williams carries off the title role with expert skill in a performance that he, especially he, very easily could have gone over the top with. Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl and the kid who played Swee'Pea are likewise letter perfect for their roles.One of the things I always liked about this movie is the music. Harry Nilsson, a greatly underappreciated talent, came up with a delightful batch of songs that are that are as rich in character as the atmosphere of Sweethaven is full of sodium. Altman's Popeye, along with Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy, is one of the rare film versions of a cartoon that succeeds. It does so by staying true to the look and spirit of the original. It wasn't created by committee to be a summer blockbuster, hence it is allowed to have a personality and flavor -- a flavor that blooms with repeat viewings.

Better late than never, I guess, because I liked it. I thought it was good and....in a very different way. I had known of this film for a long time but did not realize it was a musical. That didn't excite me, but I wound up enjoying most of the music because it was only done in short segments and the songs were decent. None were excellent, but none were awful, either.Popeye was fun to hear. Robin Williams had Popeye's mumbling down to a tee. I suggest you watch this with the English subtitles on so you can get all of what Popeye says, or you'll miss a lot of funny lines because of his mumbling. The same can almost be said of Shelly Duvall's impersonation of Olive Oyl, although you can understand her better. She, too, was fun to watch. I read somewhere that she was very depressed over her performance in this film, but she shouldn't have been. She was perfect for the role.I didn't think the supporting characters were much, such as Bluto or Wimpy, but Popeye's dad, Poopdeck Pappy, (Ray Walston) who appears late in the film is a real hoot, and little baby Swee Pea is cute. Pappy adds a lot of spark and energy to the film, just when it was really needed. My only concern was that it was a really clean movie up to then and Walston changes that, although not with anything really harsh but a number of let's haul ass statements and the like. However, overall, it's a nice, pleasing type of film. It's no award-winner, but it's a lot better than what you might have read from national critics. If you like Popeye's cartoons and comics, you should like this film, too. I would gladly watch this again.

I've watched the movie four times now -- certain scenes, in fact, more than a dozen times -- and continue to find it funny, charming in a quirky way, true to the spirit of the Popeye cartoons, and in fact quite magical. Normally I can't stomach Robin Williams, but he and Shelley Duvall are delightful and endearing in this; it's a bit of casting made in heaven, and they've got real chemistry together. Some viewers dismiss the musical numbers, but I love their oddly loose, unpretentious, offhand quality; the songs are simple, infectious, and -- that word again -- endearing. (Lately I've been walking around with the songs playing in my iPod; they can cheer one up in the middle of a New York crowd.) For me the best musical number is the first, the haunting and memorable Sweethaven, when -- after those strange, dark, disturbing opening-credit shots of the lone figure of Popeye rowing his way across the dark and stormy sea -- the sun suddenly comes out and we're introduced, as on a stage set, to the population of Sweethaven as one by one the characters come trooping out of their homes.

That, combined with a rich selection of both staple Popeye secondary characters like Wimpy and new ones like The Taxman formed a fitting backdrop against which the interaction of the main characters takes place. Some of the audial clutter was simply Robin Williams duplicating with uncanny accuracy the verbal ramblings and running dialog that Popeye always had going on in the cartoon shorts (can't imagine anyone other than him in the role).And, bits too numerous to mention, pulled right from the cartoons, add to the fun. Bluto seeing red is just an example.A sadly under-appreciated movie, to be sure.

This film requires paying attention on multiple levels, and rewards viewers who do so, as few other epic films have.There are some detractors who can't handle the fact that the film is part Musical, but this is definitely in keeping with original cartoons, which frequently featured music in their storylines.

The kicker is it really seems like a live action version of the old classic black and white Popeye cartoons, right down to the spinning pipe.Im 30, grew up in Georgia, and have seen many of the old Popeye cartoons. These cartoons didnt make much sense, but they were very predictable. Their charm was in the little things.  Things like Popeyes constant punny comments, the confusingly random splice of ludicrous characters, and the overblown fighting gags.I remember a Popeye cartoon where Popeye has to walk Olives little dog. He reluctantly agrees (sap!) and he and sissy dog meet up with Bluto walking his big bull dog.  Harassment ensues, Popeye says Me pekinese is week in de knees, they both eat spinach, and in a barrage of whimsical yet freakishly brutal retaliation, Popeye and pekinese triumph.These cartoons werent really my favorite, but seeing them put to live action with intricate detail is a trip.  In creating the world Popeye lives in, there is a necessarily huge amount of artistic license, but the sets are so cool and colorful, it almost seems like another planet.  The movie is basically an introduction to the whole Popeye saga.  The central cast of characters are all well cast and faithfully portrayed and the rib jabbingly obtuse humor is playfully retained.One thing you must brace yourself for is that this is a musical. Critically lambasted after release in 1980, it was called boring, cluttered, and a lot of attention was called to the songs as being ill-conceived and vapid. But there is a quaint lowbrow feel to the songs, as the lyrics are intentionally simple and repetitive.  Personally I like the music, its catchy in its noticeably unsophisticated originality that seems to fit with the vintage, salty world of Popeye.I saw this movie in the theater as a kid, and Im not sure if I would recommend it as a kids movie.  But seeing it again as an adult in a slightly altered state, I found it a rush of memories and laughs.  If you plan to see this movie and remember the cartoon, think of the old show first, and be amazed as it almost comes to life.

However, the surge of early TV wanting to sell things to kids and thereby creating cartoon shows and using cheap (inexpensive) black and white cartoons from the 30s, reacquainted kids, like my own, with the Popeye characters.  We're talking real Americana here, fans.  Altman, Feiffer and Nilssen are taking on our history.  As in any art, we can ask, does it work?  Well, reading through the other comments, you'll find a concensus that supports the feeling that it works.  I'm not surprised that some of our Brit friends are put off by Popeye.  It's our humor and not their 'humour.' Altman and Feiffer have put together an eerie film, timeless in its scope and lonely in its landscape.  Nilssen's music seems a little silly at times, but so what?  Ray Walston IS Poopdeck Pappy; Shelley Duval IS Olive Oyl, and Robin Williams, even when he struggles to hold the squint, IS Popeye.

You can't not enjoy it really. One reviewer said that not enjoying this movie is analogous to not enjoying puppies and babies playing with rubber duckies in a bubble bath. I think that is appropriate. The sheer detached nature of this film and it's complete lack of substance, combined with some truly clever wit and subversive humor, make it a real gem for anyone that enjoys the finer things in life.

The town of Sweethaven has become a town under scrutiny when Olive's fiancé Bluto gives out a curfew, and the town's tax man(Donald Moffat) gives them a hard time. Popeye, the sea-fairing sailor comes to this campy town searching for his Pappy(Ray Walston). This old salt was working for Bluto until Popeye and Olive Oyl discovered SweePea in a basket. The Oyls discovered also what kind of a person Bluto was so Olive called off the engagement, because like she said about him, HE'S JUST A MEAN OLD BRUTE! The fight scenes in the movie are hilarious. The fight at RoughHouse's, the boxing match against OxBlood, and the fight fight scene against Bluto after feeding Popeye spinach, one punch turned him yellow. Scaredy cat! Scaredy cat!

This soundtrack is probably one of the last things that Harry Nilsson did as an actual job, making actual money. The simplicity of his lyrics is key, keeping the movie accessible to children (See The Point). A few of Harry's colleagues & friends have bit parts - Van Dyke Parks as the piano player, for example. Robert Altman's direction is dead on. He keeps everything moving. Robin Williams showed he can act. No doubt a lot of Williams' mumbling was ad-libs, but surely he and Altman created the character together. Shelly Duvall is a great of course. A 30's style musical updated for 1980. It still works. How hard has it been to actually pull off a musical since the 1950's? HARD; REALLY hard, yet Altman and company do it.The screenplay This is first and foremost a musical.

Having seen the film six times in the theater at age nine, I may be biased of course, but I found the world of fantasy that Altman, crew, and cast created, utterly brilliant. From the enchanting town of Sweethaven (built from entirely from scratch on the island of Malta off Italy's coastline) to the costumes and larger than life characterizations and double talk, it's all truly inspired. I still believe Robin's portrayal of Popeye is one of his great acting achievements of his career. He managed to harness something intangible about the cartoon that neither I, nor anyone most likely, had ever really seen to the full extent... the true heart of the irascible sailor. You feel like you're watching an emotionally three dimensional human being, a cartoon come to life. And some of the best moments are in the mumblings and mutterings that Mr. Williams seemed to improvise to a large extent. For example, when he interacts with Olive Oyl's mother and asks about their room for renk she responds in a mind-numbingly odd way that leaves Popeye bewildered. He looks at the mailbox and sees the name Oyl and mumbles to himself, Oyl. Dat explains it. She must be a quart low. Witty, clever, brilliant. Altman's direction is also key because he lets scenes play out and breathe so that the quirky, uncomfortable moments that happen in real life are also there in this fantasy world. It lends such credibility to what could've been an overblown, vacuous cartoon movie. It's a tribute to Altman's understanding of the human condition that he injected vulnerability and caring into the characters. Ray Walston's portrayal of Poopdeck Pappy is a great example of this emotional layering. We see his disconnect from Popeye and the bitterness and regret of years lost with his son which eventually gives way to love, acceptance and true joy. It's a heartfelt subplot that, again, adds to the broader canvas of honest emotion in the film. Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl is also one of the great casting moves of all time. Has there ever been a person more suited to play a part? Her physical resemblance to the character is incredible, but it's what she does with her voice, her walk, her eyes, and just about every single part of her being that makes her the embodiment of Olive Oyl. Finally, no review of Popeye would be complete without talking about the incredible soundtrack from the legendary Harry Nilsson. It is another truly overlooked gem. Best known for the classic theme Everbody's Talking from the film Midnight Cowboy, what Nilsson does on the Popeye soundtrack is as imaginative and emotional sonically as the film is visually. It is an anthology of the entire film, a storyline told in song. From Popeye's initial arrival into the sleepy harbor town of Sweethaven which is punctuated by Nilsson's small town celebratory anthem Sweethaven to his triumphant self-affirming declarations of I Yam What I Yam and I'm Popeye The Sailor Man, the music takes you on a journey along with the characters. Since Popeye is essentially a musical in large part, all the main characters get their theme. Bluto sings with conviction, I'm Mean while blustering around and intimidating locals. Olive Oyl croons, He Needs Me as a plaintive ode to Popeye's love for her and her realization of that love. Even Poopdeck Pappy gets in on the act as Ray Walston belts out the grumpy, It's Not Easy Bein' Me and Kids, an analysis of the parent/ child dynamic that could be an addendum to any Freudian psychology class. Really listen to the lyrics as Pappy uses double talk and double negatives to hammer home his litany of irritations with little tykes. Quite amusing. When it was released in 1980, Popeye was universally panned by critics, and it was partially responsible for sending both Robert Altman and producer, Robert Evans (former head of Paramount) into tailspins. They had both been legendarily out of control on set with partying and drug use. In an episode of Inisde The Actor's Studio Robin Williams spoke about this in response to a question about what working on that set was like. He said It was Altman and Robert Evans. Whoa! Throw in Harry Nilsson, and you've got yourself a weekend. Even Betty Ford's going 'I'm booked. Very funny way to sum it up. A side note of interest the song He Needs Me is also used by Paul Thomas Anderson in his film, Punch Drunk Love to great effect. Anderson is a self- confessed Atlman fanatic, and his films are reminiscent of the Altman style with the naturalistic over-talking and large, talented casts. Okay, that's it. Go rent the Popeye DVD and sit down with the kids to enjoy a fun ride. ***No spoiler below, just a hidden treasure to look out for**** There is only one curse word in the movie, but it was clearly thrown in almost as a subversive afterthought when Popey jumps off Poopdeck Pappy's ship into the ocean near the end of the film, listen closely to the word he screams on the way down. It's a colorful one that nearly slips by if you're not really paying attention. It ain't geronimo that's for sure.

MASH director Robert Altman takes a totally different look at life exactly 10 years after his most famous film and shows his lighter side.Like `Annie' and a few others, this film succeeds in bringing a well-known comic strip character to life. Although I recall it being panned at the time &#150; and I may be among the few who praise it here, I was charmed and entertained by `Popeye.'The Fictitious sea port of Sweet Haven is brought to surrealistic life, as Popeye (Robin Williams) rows into port in search of his father. Not being a Popeye connoisseur  (although I HAVE visited the Popeye Museum in Chester, Ill., where creator E.C. Segar first showed his caricatures of townspeople on glass plates between features, while running the camera in the local theatre &#150; now the museum), I'm not sure whether Sweet Haven was ever depicted in the comics or not and whether the Oyl family was ever fleshed out there. Altman depicts it wonderfully, though. Many musicals &#150; at least to jaded modern viewers &#150; seem disjointed, due to cast members feeling musical numbers `coming on' for no reason. With the surreal backdrop of Sweet Haven, it seems only natural.The tunes, meanwhile, may not be best-selling soundtrack material, but they have their own charm. I found myself singing `Sweet, Sweet Haven' after watching the film. These are not professional singers doing the singing, which also adds an air of believability to them.Robin Williams probably won't be remembered for his role as Popeye in 50 years; yet he turns in a fine performance. Bringing to life an animated character, better known for his superhuman strength after consuming spinach, than for any personality traits, is a huge challenge. Williams rises to the occasion and turns in stellar workShelly Duvall, as Olive Oyl, gives one of her very best performances. She is perfectly cast and makes a charming Olive. The two have wonderful chemistry together and even parody the Jimmy Stewart-Donna Reed `Wonderful Life' kiss, in their endearing `Phooey' scene. In fact, Duvall is probably more attractive as Olive Oyl than she is in any other move &#150; and if THAT isn't darning someone with faint praise, I don't know what IS! (lol)The cast is solid, with the Oyl family, Wempy, Bluto and others solidly played. The other truly outstanding performance, though, is by veteran actor Ray Walston. From Martian (in `My Favorite Martian,'), to Popeye's long-lost `fahddah' (and I hope this isn't a spoiler!!!), he is wonderful as Poopdeck Pappy. He and Williams are absolutely charming together and add their own chemistry to the cute movie.I'm not sure what E.C. Segar would have thought about it, but I know I was charmed by it. Altman didn't try to make `Popeye' a social commentary like MASH; he was wise enough to let the fluffy musical/comedy proclaim to viewers `I amg when I amg, and that's all that I amg!'

I remember watching it when I was a little kid, and loving it.  Now, many years later, I watched it again, and I realized what a weird movie it was.  It makes sense because of it's satirical attitude towards talking about everyday life and the people in the world today.  But by itself, it's very incoherent and difficult to understand.  People hated it, but my Dad and I found something a little bit deeper in it.  I never understood why they sang a song about food.  When I watched it with my Dad though, we discussed it a little further, and it finally made sense and had a profound message.  Everything is food?  Well, yes.  That's life.  The circle of life revolves around survival with food.  Life is food, when you think deeply enough about it.  It's strange, and it's made all the stranger the way it's presented in the film.  But it's very true!  Popeye takes place in the bizarre world of Seahaven, but it's really about our own world and it thinks deeply about many things that we the everyday people take for granted.  When I understood that, I started to love it all over again.  I was somewhat disappointed with the ending.  It seemed hurried, and there wasn't a real closing statement.  Since Popeye talked so much about the world we live in and the people who live in it, I felt there should have been something more.  I liked Popeye, but beware, it's weird and not for all tastes.  You have to watch it a few times and dig a little deeper with each viewing to get the full benefit of the film.  "},{"Title":"He Yam What He Yam!

That's right, Popeye's purpose was to sell newspapers long before he hit the theaters as an animated short subject star, and this movie brings to life those characters such as Rough House the cook and Bill Barnacle the town drunk that appeared in the Thimble Town Theater strip (and then later, Popeye comic strip).  It also brings along some of the subject matter usually handled in daily newspaper comics such as tariffs and land barons. Perhaps this is why Robert Altman, not a director known for family films, was brought onto the project.  (Screenwriter Jules Pfeifer incidently started out as a comic strip writer before venturing into adult film projects such as Carnal Knowledge and Oh! Calcutta.)  The problem is that the film should have been made, could have been made, in the early forties.  The audience would have at least understood the subject matter (For example, the delightful Blondie film series is now great nostalgic slapstick fun but younger audiences don't have enough understanding of WW2 family life to appreciate it fully).  Most audiences who watch the live action version of Popeye are expecting the cartoon series of the fifties (or egad, the 70's!). The contemporary newspaper crowd (who is the usual intended target of Altman) grew up with Popeye on TV, not in the comic strip, not on the silver screen sandwiched between newsreels of battleships and the latest W.C. Fields comedy!  Would they even understand the appropriateness of sweet sea chanties?  Some sort of concession was made by having the actors mimic the characters as portrayed in the film cartoons.  They do a really good job with it too.  Robin Williams has the under-his-breath mumble, the hick-upy laughter, the stance, walk, bulging arms that do helicopter blade turns in a fight.  Shelly Duvall (a former Robert Altman protege) pegs Olive Oyl perfectly, especially with her waving of arms and pretzel twisting of legs as she tries to turn around in confusion.  Just watch her walk out of a room and it seems like your watching a cartoon.  Together, Williams and Duvall have real chemistry and are a delight.  Swee'Pea is one of the most enduring infants ever (and so little is ever said about him).  His facial expressions are just magical (and without today's computer generated effects!). Incidently, he's Robert Altman's grandson.  I don't know how many takes it took to get some of those reactions, but it was well worth it.  Finally, to answer the harshest critics, was the plot slow and unfunny?  Yes to both. The production values, sets, actors, and songs were excellent.  The script could have worked under the direction of someone more suited to family-style slapstick comedy which was Paramount's (and Disney's) intention.  The pratfalls were too pedestrian, seeming like rehearsals (remember the dance scene from Speilberg's own flop 1942?).  Though the film really has heart, the pace of all the comedy bits failed.  Acrobats were hired to play many of the non-speaking townsfolks and it looks it.  This film needed a director who understood the comedy timing of slapstick routines (from Buster Keaton to Jerry Lewis).  Then it could have been the laugh fest it's audience wanted instead of a sweet film with heart and charm.  It's a time capsule buried in 1930, unearthed in 1980, and misunderstood in the year 2000. Perhaps Popeye's answer to film historians would be this  I yam what I yam and that's all that I yam.

Usually when I tell people that this movie is one of my all-time top five favorites, they laugh, but when I told him, I found a fellow fan who knew what an incredibly well-constructed and well-acted movie this is.It has some VERY minor harsh language, but all-in-all it's safe for the kiddies (who I'm sure have heard those words before), but has a lot of more mature elements thrown in for the grown-ups. That's another reason I love this flick just like the earlier original cartoons, the muttering and mumbling going on in the background and on the sly is quite scandalous and funny, if you pay attention to it. I'm sure it's Williams' usual ad lib that he's well-known for.One particularly humorous ad lib is when he's reading a letter, with Sweet Pea in a basket in front of him, and Sweet Pea clearly says Baby. Williams points to the letter and says, Yes, you're a baby, it says right here! going along with the baby's actual word (the baby was the grandson of the producer, if I remember right.)I don't normally like musicals, but I love every single song in this film, and have seen it so often that I can sing along to it.

Especially He Needs Me, sung by Shelly Duvall, recently fully realized in the movie Punch-Drunk Love.This movie looks amazing, IMO. The town is completely alive, and like others have said, the movie is like a complete replica of a Popeye cartoon. Shelly Duvall and Willams are amazing.Some things didn't seem so necessary, like the boxing match; but I thought it kind of fitted with the whole scheme of things.

The music is hit or miss, when it hits it hits just right; when it misses, it misses by a mile (Bluto's song). The all out musical numbers involving many people are hard to understand or just poorly done, but the personal numbers between Popeye and Olive are especially good. I think He Needs Me as sung by Shelley Duvalle is one of the best musical numbers in any movie I've seen. She sings it off key and dances in an amusing fashion, but it doesn't get any sweeter.

It ends up looking like someone with severe autism painstakingly recreated E.G. Seger's cartoons without realizing they're supposed to be funny. One thing in particular that I think deserves special mention is the HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE sound. User evan-152 is quite right when he describes the soundtrack as strangely quiet and confusing. The movie never should have been released in this condition. I had to turn up my TV volume almost to the max while watching it, and even then everything was flat and muted. The ambient sound is all mixed together to create this bizarre white noise effect, occasionally punctuated by an extra-loud cartoon sound effect. Believe me when I say there is nothing weirder than hearing a roomful of muffled voices suddenly interrupted by a loud BOOOINNNG. And the way the musical numbers seem to gradually rise up out of nowhere is just creepy. The movie should almost be required viewing for students who are going into sound engineering.If you are somehow able to look beyond the disastrous visuals, plot and sound and enjoy this movie, good for you, but I cannot imagine a sane person seeing this as anything other than a high-concept idea gone terribly wrong.

Many of the spoken words cannot be heard distinctly and you needed subtitles in order to know what was said. The movie can be praised for how detailed the sets and costumes that were used to portray the characters and locations from the cartoon series. But, it fails to deliver in plot coherence and spoken script. I could easily understand the cartoon episodes as a child, but I was baffled by the movie version as an adult. I know that making the cartoon transition to the big screen can often times be difficult, but I think they tried to make the movie version too much of a replication of the cartoon episodes and they left out the plot development.

I haven't seen Popeye since it came out (I was only eight), but I surprisingly remembered almost all of it, including those dreadful songs.I have to agree with those of you describing the strangeness of this film (I was especially amused by the reviewer simultaneously conflicted and, seemingly, terrified by the creepiness!). But for those of you who are fans of the old Popeye cartoons & comic strips from the 1930s, you have to admit,however, that this movie is pretty darn faithful. This may be why it's so bizarre it's a living cartoon. Bringing a cartoon to actual life usually takes away from the original's vibe, and creates a completely new, almost surreal, one through the attempt. It almost can't be avoided. Popeye's huge forearms, for example, are one thing in the comic - an exaggeration of workingman strength. Seeing them in real life is quite unnerving. Does this faithfulness make it a good film though? Odd, to be certain (almost fascinatingly so), but good?I was always a fan of those old black & white cartoons I grew up with,so I was REALLY excited to see this back in 1980. As a child, I clearly remember being disappointed and bored, except for a few fighting scenes. I like it now more, but like our conflicted reviewer friend, I'm not completely sure why. Robin Williams does a great job with Popeye's trademark always-mumbled-beneath-breath irreverent wisecracks (ad-libbed perhaps?). Shelly Duvall is downright perfection. Aloha Ray Walston! And then there are the songs....The late Harry Nilsson wrote some great stuff in his time, and had an incredible range and odd sense of humor. His music still permeates the movie world on a regular basis (Coconut from Reservoir Dogs, Jump Into the Fire from Goodfellas, Midnight Cowboy, You've Got Mail and, who could forget, the memorably annoying theme song to The Courtship of Eddie's Father). He was also, along with best friend & drinking buddy/sometime-collaborator John Lennon, known as quite the Wild Man. What was he thinking here? These songs have such a carelessness to them that some of them don't even seem like songs at all - they just kind of breeze in and breeze out. Lyrics are incredibly simplistic and repetitive. And I'm still not sure if Pappy's rant toward the end of the pic was intended as a number or not. But maybe this was what he was going for. Maybe Nilsson was experimenting with the musical format. Maybe he, like myself, had a hard time suspending disbelief when watching musicals, and finds it kind of weird and obtrusive when characters suddenly break into song and dance (you have to admit...the whole idea is pretty hard to swallow when you really think about it). Then again, maybe he was just losing it! This could've been the equivalent of a musical hangover. At the very least, as another reviewer mentioned, the songs DO ultimately have a catchiness that you can't quite escape. Who knows? Maybe this film will gain some cult appeal.Even though it was based on existing material, Popeye is definitely different! For that alone, it has to be worth something. Right?

This movie, more than any other that I can remember, is the best example of a live action cartoon, in the best sense of the term. Watching it was like a cartoon come to life. It was truly wonderful and extremely funny to watch characters behaving as if they were in one, from their movement to the way they spoke. And none exemplify this better than Robin Williams in the title role, who channels his unbridled comic talent into a completely dedicated performance which is equally hilarious and touching. The story is fairly simple, though. Popeye rows into the town of Sweethaven looking for his 'Pap.' While there, he (and the audience) find out about how messed up that town really is. They have an absurd amount of taxes, and everyone is kept in fear of a mysterious Commodore and Captain Bluto, who run the town. He also meets Olive Oyl, played (at times screechingly) by Shelley Duvall (who also fits her role perfectly). This film is also a musical, and there several catchy numbers which have the capacity to stick in your head if you aren't careful. If I have any complaints, it's that Shelley Duvall isn't as good a singer as she is an actress, but nothing she does really ruins the picture. The biggest flaw in the film is direction the narrative takes about two thirds of the way through. I also thought that Bluto wasn't really given his due as a character. Still, for Robin Williams fans this will be essential viewing. It's a wacky, manic experience that demands to be seen.

The stretch and squeeze, morphing (and other physical impossibilities) were hallmarks of these animated films. They also reflected the times. Snow White, Any Rags, Pots'n Pans, the Old Man of the Mountain are works I never tire of watching. They reflect gritty street life, wishful thinking, hunger (I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today), poverty, joie de vivre and hope.This era also gave rise to many cartoon strips which served as inspiration for animated films. Max Fleisher was one of the pioneers. He created Betty Boop, Popeye, Gullivers Travels and many more. I think the movie pulled off a miracle in keeping that surreal quality. Robert Altman was the perfect director with his busy visuals and overlapping dialogue. The set design reminded me of Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas with its crazy, cartoony settings. And Shelley Duvall was brilliant as Olive Oyl!This film reflects an imagined reality far different than that of Spongebob, and unless one seeks it out, it's not that easy to find.

The room is nothing to write home about yet there is an added attraction. Mrs. O has a daughter, Olive (Shelly Duvall) who is a skinny lass but pleasing to Popeye. Yet, horrors, she is to marry the town's bully, er, commissioner, Bluto. The only thing positive that Olive can sing about Bluto is he is large. Before long, Popeye wins her over, especially when they rescue a baby in a basket, Sweet Pea, and try to stay out of Bluto's way. At this point, Popeye REFUSES SPINACH so, despite his large arms, he can't best Bluto. After finding his wayfaring papa (Ray Walston) he learns some secrets that may help win Olive for himself. Even if there are octopuses circling in the waters! This unique movie may not be for all but its quirky delights and rapid-fire lines will entertain those who like it original. Watch Popeye mutter Au reservoir and you can double over with laughs. Yes, Williams is great and captures Popeye's essence well. Duvall is even better, she was made to play Olive and her voice resemblance to the cartoon character is uncanny. Walston, Paul Dooley and all the rest are fine support. Then, too, the scenery, which was captured on Malta, is wonderfully offbeat while costumes, songs from Niellson, a clever script by Jules Ffiefer and a one-of-a-kind direction by Robert Altman add up to something wacky and fun.

Director Robert Altman's Popeye is one of those films that should be given credit. For being a film that was released before CGI was a prominent special effect, it does a spectacular job at making all the characters look as accurate as possible. And that's just one of the aspects of this film that makes it stand out from the rest.Robin Williams stars as the one-eyed sailor and I got to admit, it was a smart choice casting him. Williams' acting is brilliant. All the mannerisms, speech impediments, and wisecracks are all like what Popeye would probably say and they're funny to hear. Not to mention the costume he wears is great looking too. I'm curious to how they got him to have such large arms. Playing Olive Oyl is actress Shelley Duvall. Her acting is also very accurate because of how physically lanky her body structure is. Her clumsiness adds to the humor as well. My favorite character in this film was Poopdeck Pappy acted by Ray Walston. Walston has some really comical lines and it's even funnier whenever he's laughing or ranting. I'm not going to list all the actors because the cast goes on and on but to summarize, Altman picked the perfect set of individuals to portray every character in this movie. Supposedly, Altman hired many actors from a circus to participate. This make sense because throughout the film, the viewer will notice many of these actors are quite flexible. This is a good thing to have when it comes to creating a live action cartoon movie. The area I wasn't expecting in Robert Altman's version of Popeye was the music. Discovering that the actors also have their own solos was an interesting add-on. At first, it may seem like the singing parts weren't necessary but it turns out that having the cast break out into song gives the story a little bit more liveliness to it. So in retrospect, this film doesn't have a musical score because it is a musical. The songs aren't bad so there's nothing to really dislike about it. My favorite was the Everything is food song. Throughout that entire song, there were a lot of funny parts.Going back to special effects, there is absolutely no CGI in this film. Everything is formed one way another that uses anything in the physical world. This is what makes this film so good because everything is real and on screen for the actors to touch. When Popeye and Bluto fight, the way they fight is all made to look like no matter what happens, they are still on screen. Also any objects that any characters touch can fall apart or break off which adds to the comedy of the film.Comedy is the other great element to this film. Even though much of it is over the top gags, a lot of it is still funny. What was most enjoyable was how the actors coordinated the gags. For example, Popeye finds his pipe on the ground and above him a group of men carrying a piano on a ledge. The group loses grip of the piano and it sways right over Popeye's head just as he bends down to grab his pipe. If that's not well planned timing, then I don't know what is!For 1980, the cartoon live action version of Popeye is done with utmost preciseness in its characters and comical elements. This is also probably the only cartoon adaptation that is a musical too, which makes it that much more culturally deviant.

Hence, we saw the storyline on the older AMOS 'N ANDY Radio Show go from the interplay between the two title characters, in which the character of Andy went from being the wise guy who was constantly out to cheat his partner, a very gullible and trusting Amos to a perennial storyline in which Andy most usually played the patsy to the super conniving Kingfish. Meanwhile, Amos evolved to a level headed, family man complete with wife, Ruby and Daughter, Arabella, This is the format that we're most accustomed to; as it was the stage of development that the series was in when it made the leap to the Television Tube.BOTH the character of Arthur Fonzarelli (Fonzie) on HAPPY DAYS and Ron Erkel on FAMILY MATTERS just rode the crest of the wave of fan popularity from supporting characters to the status of near co-star.SO it was on in the realm of the printed page; with the development of the Daily and Sunday Newspaper, continued story comic strips. There were occasional characters that rose high above the popularity of the original Stars to the position of numero uno. As an example, BARNEY GOOGLE first gave co-star billing to before being virtually run out of his own Comic Strip by his Hillbilly buddy, SNUFFY SMITH.THAT brings us to today's subject, the live action movie of POPEYE (Walt Disney Productions/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1980).WE'RE all familiar with the Sailor Man's legendary feats; but we may be a trifle foggy on his origin. (Do those of you still reading get that sneaking suspicion that you're gonna git a reminder? Well, you are!) Hearkening back to the post World War I days of 1919, a staff cartoonist for Hearst Publications' Chicago American, a young cartoonist from Downstate Chester, Illinois, Elzie C. Seegar, began a daily comic strip which featured the adventures of one Castor Oyl, his sister, Olive Oyl, her beau, Hamm Gravy and others. Entitled THIMBLE THEATER, it soon caught notice of the main editorial office of Hearst's King Features Syndicate and was run in Hearst Papers throughout the land; as well as being offered for the u$ual fee$ to other papers.IT was ten years later, in the early days of 1929, that a walk-on character, a funny lookin, bow-legged, squint-eyed, balding, red-headed sailor, came on board (so to speak). It wasn't very long before POPEYE was the dominating force and Star of the Strip (although it retained the title of THIMBLE THEATER, it added Starring Popeye the Sailor Man.POPEYE was such an instantaneous hit that he was soon starring in his own Max and Dave Fleischer Studios-Paramount Pictures Cartoon Series. Radio, Comic Books, Television and a whole sh*t house full of merchandising toys, puzzles, vibrators, etc., etc.THE day finally arrived and the time seemed ripe for a live action go round at a POPEYE Movie Musical. So they did it.AS a mutual collaboration between Walt Disney Studios and Popeye's old Big Studio, Paramount Pictures Corporation., we were treated to POPEYE. It stars Robin Williams as Popeye and what must be considered to be a most remarkable cast. The supporting players and their parts were Olive Oyl (Shelley Duvall) Poopdeck Pappy (Ray Walston), Wimpy (Paul Dooley), Bluto (Paul L. Smith), Castor Oyl (Donovan Scott), Rough House (Allan F. Nicholls), Swee'pea (Wesley Ivan Hurt), Hamm Gravy (Bill Irwin) and many others too numerous to bore you any further.* WHEN mounted, put together and staged for the camera, it has the look of a Broadway Musical. In a way it appears to resemble the filmed version of L'IL ABNER (Triad Prod./Paramount Pictures,1959).WE must confess that upon the completion of our first viewing, back some 28 years ago, we didn't care much for it. We found it a little l-o-n-g and d-r-a-w-n out. None of the songs seemed to resonate in our memories. We sort of panned it then; or at least would have if we were writing these reviews then.HOWEVER, just like the NFL, we now say; &#133;..upon further review&#133;.. We recently watched it on the tube on a rather old VHS copy. Well, we aren't sure if we've matured some since those bygone days at that Matinée at the Evergreen Plaza's Cinema, with our young 'uns or perhaps this time I ain't so tired from having worked the graveyard shift; but it seemed much more enjoyable! IT could also be that we now sort of understand just what this 'FILM', with the services of Robert Altman as Director and screenplay penned by the old Master himself, Jules Feiffer, was an attempt to salute both Popeye and Mr. Seegar with its ascension to the highest level of art that was possible for a wee, humble little THIMBLE THEATRE of a Comic Strip.NOTE * If you're so interested, just read the credits like me and Schultz always do, It's always worthwhile and occasionally it provides one with some little morsel of info heretofore unknown to yourself.POODLE SCHNITZ!!

A few other moments were a little less below par. And I personally don't think the songs in the film were that good or necessary. Popeye the cartoon was not a musical.

As another reviewer pointed out, turning on the subtitles makes a world of difference. I've seen this movie several times over the years including a screening shortly before it's original release. Until I turned on the subtitles, I never realized Popeye has so many great one liners!Which brings us to the highlights, Robin Williams absolutely nailed the role. The sets are gorgeous, and the characters (for the most part) are great. The story is pretty good. As good as you'd expect, turning a group of short cartoons into a feature length film.At the end of the day it's enjoyable for a lazy afternoon movie.

This was probably one of the first of its kind to bring legendary cartoon characters to live action. I guarantee many will see this and think how bad it is but then you watch it a few more times and it starts to grow on you and you begin to see the often brilliant things about it. It is the definition of a 'cult classic.' Director Robert Altman brings style and unique direction to the film bringing to life in such a cartoony and over the top but real life way. The citizens of Sweet Haven are so boisterous and fun to watch. Who better to bring to life Popeye than the legendary comedian Robin Williams who does a terrific job paying homage to the famous cartoon sailor. Never once will you feel like he is poking fun at the source material. Shelley Duvall certainly looks the part of Olive Oyl but my goodness is she ever annoying (perhaps that's the point.) Paul Smith is terrific as Bluto, the perfect adversary and like the other characters look his part perfectly. Same could be said for Paul Dooley who plays Wimpy, although he is very underused and sort of unlikable in the role.Popeye's cult status really thrives on the look of the film. There is just something incredibly unique and different about the style of the movie. I probably would have avoided making this a musical as it has a Broadway feel to it but the songs aren't very catchy and just don't add anything to the story. Fans of Popeye are sure to not be disappointed but kids might not take to the movie because it does sort of have a dark undertone. It is absolutely something to check out for its uniqueness but it won't ever be called a stone cold classic.

On the other hand, after starting out like a masterpiece, it doesn't really go anywhere. The plot lines get more conventional and less subversive as it goes along, and the climax is pretty instantly forgettable. At first you think it's going to be Popeye meets Threepenny Opera, a complex social satire under the jokes, but it ends up just sweet, good natured, wonderfully done, but slightly shallow fun.

Upon viewing it again recently, the thing that struck me is despite the fact that I hated it the first time, the second time around it is oddly entertaining in places, just for the downright weird nature of the film.The story is a prequel to all of the cartoons, telling how Popeye and all the assorted characters met. Popeye (Robin Williams) comes to the town of Sweethaven searching for his father, and rents a room at the Oyl's house, falling in love with their daughter, Olive (Shelley DuVall), and making an enemy of Bluto (Paul L. Smith). They find a baby who can predict the future, and Bluto schemes to use him to find some treasure. Popeye finds his father, Poopdeck Pappy (Ray Walson), and defeats Bluto and wins over Olive after discovering that spinach gives him super strength.It is a really, really weird film. A complete village was built for it, and it's obvious a lot of thought went into it, but it's just odd to see people pretending to be cartoon characters. There are several moments that are oddly jarring for a children's film, such as Popeye uttering an expletive (earning this a PG), and also a song where Olive says how Bluto isn't really that much, but he's large. These moments left me confused as to who the target audience actually is, as it appears to be trying to tell the story in a semi-serious vein, rather than being a sendup of the Popeye franchise.It also appears that they ran out of money at the end, as the finale, involving Olive being menaced by an evil octopus, is rather shoddy, with the octopus looking rather fake and plastic compared with other films of the 1980s.That said, if you like Robin Williams' aptitude for voices, his performance does capture Popeye quite well, and he pretty much is the source of most of the film's limited entertainment value. And it also is sort of ahead of its time with the entire prequel film/cartoon to film craze going on right now.In short, it is intriguing, but not really that great a film.

Characters like Castor Oyl (Olive's brother), Rough-House, Geezil, and others who are nowhere to be found in the excellent Fleischer Bothers' cartoons of the '30's play prominent roles in this movie.  Also absent in the Fleischers' shorts, but seen in this movie is the complete absence of any sense of time or place - Sweethaven is by the sea, but otherwise we have no idea where it is.  Is it in New Zealand, or Scotland, or Canada, or the U.S.A.?  And is it 1930 or 1830?  It's impossible to tell.  Of course, it doesn't really matter.I should mention that, although I like this movie, I thought the production numbers were some of the worst ever seen in a movie not made in Bombay.

Maybe it would be a different perspective had I seen it when I was little- frankly I'm not sure why I missed it, as I liked the cartoons and liked Robin Williams- but now as an adult Popeye is one crazy kind of movie. It's a work that is all its own, even as it looks way too derivative of bad kids musicals and second rate slapstick. But there's 'something' to Popeye, I can't quite put my finger on it, and it's due more than likely to Robert Altman. Some have said the film's a masterpiece (I wouldn't go that far), while some say it's a travesty (I wouldn't go there either). One thing is for certain under a different director, either more mainstream or of a more high-velocity action-movie kind of filmmaker, Popeye wouldn't look and feel this way. Yet Popeye turns out to be satisfying because Altman does what any of the exceptional directors- Sam Raimi, Tim Burton, Guillermo Del-Toro, Richard Donner- who've adapted comic books do, as he captures the spirit of the source in a specific style suitable for the director. It's far from being any great work of art, but I'd dare anyone else to make a Popeye film as joyful and buoyantly crazy as this.And maybe such an idiosyncratic director like Altman- who as Gary Trudeau once said is a great director of 'scenes'- could translate such simple little diddies like Popeye stories. There are no big arcs to follow or a whole host of villains that Popeye must thwart; the only story is that Popeye (Robin Williams) comes to Sweet Haven looking for his Pappy, only to find that he's something of an outsider among the town's multiple eccentrics, meets and sort of falls for Olive Oyl (Shelly Duvall), and gets into hot water with Bluto (Paul L. Smith) while trying to protect a baby named Swee'pea. The rest of the picture is like a big ball of impressions taken from the original strip, and a little from the cartoon (sorry, folks, not much spinach until the climax). But what Altman also goes for is the manic side of Sweet Haven, how many rules there are with the guy who fines you for every little thing (unless you're Olive Oyl for some reason), and bullies seem to be right at the Burger joint on the mark. Luckily there's not too much overlapping dialog like in his other films, otherwise it might get cluttered- that is, if it isn't already.Did I mention it's a musical? And not a great musical by any stretch. I'd imagine it wasn't Altman's intention- maybe more Robert Evans, or whomever, maybe Disney- to make this film a musical, least of all like this, where the ratio is split down the side half the songs are actually pretty catchy, or at least performed well (He Needs Me, which Olive Oyl sings and was used in Punch-Drunk Love recently, is probably my favorite after the original theme song), and the others are just bad, dead weight (the song that Popeye sings as he writes a letter to Swee'Pea and brightly hued images of Swee'Pea pop up, is atrocious, as is Pappy's number when he's tied up). Yet somehow the songs don't detract a whole lot from the rambunctious attitude to comedy. Sometimes it might be something unintentional, like a line from Williams as he mutters a throwaway jab or observation that's a riot. Or the physical pratfalls, mostly expected like Olive's clumsiness or Bruto's BIG anger in the house enraged at waiting for Olive, that do connect.It's this cheerfully mad attitude that keeps Popeye from becoming a total warp of a kids movie, where watching Popeye go to work on a Oxblood Oxheart in a boxing match is beautifully choreographed to the wacky comic-book mentality. The only danger in all of this then is to consider whether much of this is funny because it genuinely is, for a family movie anyway, or if it's just so corny that you can't help but laugh. It's not a Howard the Duck scenario, of course, but there are times when it is, frankly, stupid stuff Altman's dealing with here, and ironically photographed in mostly great compositions from Giuseppe Rotuno (yes, of 8 1/2 fame) and with wonderful production/costume designs. Where else will I see an animatronic pelican and (a totally spot-on) Shelly Duvall getting dragged underwater by a rubber octopus, least in an Altman film? Or Robin Williams with fore-arms larger than his head? Could it be a guilty pleasure? If it is, then damned if it isn't one of the sunniest and most delirious of the 80s. Well, blow me down!

I wonder if Altman insisted upon his regular method of film-making, in coming up with a lot of it on the spot, having his actors create the scenes. It feels like there was at least some level of improvisation, and it doesn't work because these characters are all two-dimensional cartoons. Neither Altman nor the actors are ever able to convince that these people are real, even in their fantasy world. When asked to improvise, I imagine the actors had a hard time imagining what their characters' motivations were, as there's not much psychology in your average Popeye cartoon. A lot of the characters' interactions consist of moaning, shouting and jumping up and down angrily and it gets annoying. The film might also have worked better if the music were better. Harry Nilsson's songs are almost all poor, except for the two performed by Shelley Duvall, perhaps only because Duvall's Olive Oyl voice sounds so good in song (remember how brilliantly P.T.

And Fate decided here to morph the classic cartoon into a cute little stage version of itself, so benign, so dull, so non threatening and so lifeless as a movie that it manages to be fascinating. And this, mostly due to the fame of its director, I suppose, but to tell you the truth, its mostly because Shelly Duvall and Robin Williams hit the cartoon nails on the head, and gave inspired, ingeniously perfect interpretations of Popeye and Olive Oyl. They are the reasons that even while you're cringing through this strange dud of a film, you can't stop watching it until its over. Ray Walston as Popeye's father captured it too. Whatever it is. Study the Kubrikian opening, when Popeye the Sailor braves a raging storm at sea in a rowboat, in end of the world gloom and doom, only to have the scene lighten into a sunny piece of fluff when he lands in Sweet Haven. Study this, and you'll see that a spirit of childlike wonder touched Altman and literally forced him to go in an aggressively silly, lighthearted direction.The problem with this movie was that the well written music was so poorly arranged and orchestrated that it did little more than hold the movie hostage as stiff and stagey, which we dismiss as quirky thanks to the genius of Williams and Duvall. I could listen to them talk to each other all day long doing those voices. Remember what John Williams did for Stephen Spielberg in Hook? If that had happened here, we would be having a different conversation about this classically strange and curiously compelling movie. It maintains a powerful innocence, an almost tragic naivite, that could help explain why Fate decided to release these classic cartoon characters in humility, instead of grandeur. This movie is for the pure in heart. The innocent, naïve child in all of us.

I remember it from when I was a kid, but I also remember it leaving a bad taste that has taken 30+ years to get over. So tonight I gave it another try and... well, it is better than I remember, but I also understand now why I didn't like it then. First, the good - it actually does a pretty good job following the feel and tone of the original cartoons. If you don't know the characters or cartoon, don't complain about Shelly Duvall's singing, or the goofiness, or everything that was completely and directly related to the original Popeye. (Why would you even watch it? Sheesh.) As for the bad... It's long. Really, REALLY long. Not like Desolation of Smaug long, but it's just hard to take a concept that was always meant to be 5-10 min. and turn it into a full length feature film. (Sadly, Hollywood didn't learn this from Popeye and has tried everything from cartoons to board games since; Expect Candy-Land The Movie any time now.) The first hour is cute, and quaint, and you think about the cartoon and it's kind of fun. The second hour is... well, I can't say for sure. I fell asleep for part of it, and couldn't stop thinking about what else I should be doing the rest of the time. Then there is the Haul Ass final pseudo-song ending. OK, maybe Popeye's Pappy is saying Haul Aft, but this is supposed to be a kids movie and it simply gets old and wasn't really funny the first time. So, I guess my suggestion is this - watch the first half hour or so, see some great performances, have a trip down memory lane and then let it go. It ends how the cartoons end - Popeye eats the spinach, Brutus looses, and toot-toot, all is well in the world. I just saved 60-90 minutes of your life. You will thank me someday.

His M*A*S*H film was greatly misunderstood by many critics. Popeye is also unique and has even been called boring by the great Leonard Maltin. It's a live-action cartoon. In the long-ago days before CGI, everything had to be fabricated or matted in. So, there is a charming crudeness about it. Only a few decent songs, like Sweethaven. Most of Harry Nillson's music is not that tuneful, but it explains the plot quite well He's Large refers to Bluto, of course. Basically, a series of set-pieces Popeye arrives in Sweethaven. The boarding house meal, which introduces the characters. Sweetpea is found. The prize fight. The horse race. The inevitable fight with both Bloto and the Octopussy. (I love the octopussy because it is so intentionally fake-looking and non-scary.) A few plot twists such as Popeye hates canned spinach, and Pappy's treasure is a memory chest, and not precious jewels or gold. I don't like Geezil the undertaker. He looks too ethnic and I don't remember him being in any early Fletcher cartoons, do you? I also dislike the taxman character. Both Robin Williams (Popeye) and Shelly Duvall (Olive Oyl) absolutely are their characters, through brilliant acting and costumes. Bluto and the others are not quite as memorable, by comparison. If you haven't seen this in a long time, you will have to see it twice to truly appreciate it. Often, most of the first half-hour is cut or shortened for cable and that's not so bad as the opening scenes are static with less action, except for Roughhouse's Diner. View this widescreen only, as the cartoonish sets make this movie. Nothing truly objectionable, except the phrase haul ass by Pappy (Ray Walston) is repeated several times and gets quite annoying. Finally, at the very end of the film, Popeye sings I'm Popeye the Sailor Man. Not everyone will like this movie. It is fun but not over-the-top funny. It is kind of a curio. There is a new animated Popeye projected for 2015, by the way.

Popeye I wasn't sure whether I wanted to see due to its dubious reputation, but I saw it anyway because of the cast.I actually thought Popeye was decent. However I do think it could have been better, and while I personally don't think it is as bad as its reputation I can understand some of the criticisms made. Popeye is far from the best movie musical, I do not think it is as bad as Xanadu, Can't Stop the Music, Mame or Grease 2.And while it is one of Altman's weakest efforts of what I've seen it is as far as disappointing movie musicals from great directors go it is not as bad as Lumet's The Wiz or Attenborough's A Chorus Line(I am in the minority who loves Huston's Annie, despite its maligning).For my thoughts on the movie, Altman's directing is not as efficient as it was with Gosford Park, MASH, Nashville or Macabe and Mrs Miller, but while it lacks buoyancy he does do what he can and while some scenes are better directed than others, it is not as heavy handed or as lethargic as the directing jobs of The Wiz and A Chorus Line.Popeye does have its flaws. Some of the editing is a little scrappy, not always but some scenes don't always flow from one scene to another as seamlessly as it could've done. The story benefits from a great idea once you get over the idea of Popeye hating spinach(people say that it is a contradiction to the timeless cartoons and I am sorry to say they're right), but is bogged down sometimes by some pacing that comes across as a little too manic and the fact its execution is a tad too over-simplistic.The dialogue is often silly, some of the slapstick didn't work for me such as the destruction of Popeye's room, and I think incomprehensible too, I understand they were trying to recreate the spirit of the spirits with the mumbling but with it happening a vast majority of the times here I think they went a little overboard though I credit them for effort. There were however some lines I chuckled at such as the Baby Oyl one and was touched by.My feelings on the songs were mixed. Some are great, I enjoyed Popeye the Sailor Man and also He Needs Me, SweetHaven and I'm Mean. Others suffer from forgettable melodies that lyrics that either don't make sense or don't have much of a structure. The incidental score however especially in the end credits is fantastic.I was also mixed on the effects. Most of them are not too bad actually. One however looked cheap and in a very distracting sense as well, and that was the octopus puppet.Flaws aside, the film aside from some scrappy editing looks fantastic. Sweethaven is beautifully designed here, the costumes show some effort to stick to the cartoon/comic's spirit, the camera angles are good and the atmosphere is evoked very well.The choreography is not the most sprightly I've seen nor the most inept. In general it was decent, and fitting with the tone of the song. The characters are one-dimensional, but pretty likable.The casting aside from how the film looks is the best asset of the movie. Robin Williams is pitch perfect as Popeye and Shelley Duvall was born for a more seductive Olive-Oyl. Paul L.Smith is great as Bluto, and Ray Walston and Paul Dooley are solid. Wesley Ivan Hurt is an adorable Swee'pea.Overall, not bad, not good, just decent in my eyes. 6/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"The first movie I ever walked out of.","Date":"7 April 2011","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" When this movie came out, I was 10.

Characters in a cartoon are meant to be freakish, because the world of an animated cartoon is, by its very nature, completely different from the real world. That's why any attempt to adapt an animated cartoon into a live-action movie is doomed to failure---even now, with all the CGI capabilities that didn't exist for Popeye.I like Altman's films.

In fact, Duvall is excellent, mixing Olive's gawkiness and gracefulness with ease. Director Robert Altman, shooting in Malta, creates an artificial world for these characters and unfortunately that works against the film. Instead of exploiting Malta for its natural beauty, the film has a decidedly studio-bound feel and instead of making it more stylish, just makes the whole enterprise drab. And that despite the use of legendary cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno. Paul Smith is ideal as Bluto as is Altman stalwart Paul Dooley as Wimpy, however the casting of Ray Walston as Popeye's father is a major deficit.

I had thought that Quintet was the nadir of his 1970s film career, but I had forgotten just how atrocious A Wedding is. But then I re-watched Popeye and think that there's a new serious contender. It's almost like after making Nashville, Altman set out to one-up himself in bad movies, and see just how much worse each could be than the one before it. (Though I have to exclude 3 Women from this -- a remarkable film).Popeye is an example of what happens when Altman's rambling style goes completely wrong. The film is a shambling mess, with not much discernible plot, and it's almost the exact opposite of the cartoons on which it's based. Those were little jewels of narrative economy -- even a movie made for kids needs to be well written. Robin Williams is a riot as Popeye, and his constant muttering is easily the best thing about the movie. It's also worth watching to see Shelley Duvall in the role she was born to play, and she does it almost too well, making Olive Oyl just as annoying in human form as she was as a cartoon. The Harry Nilsson songs are terrible, and they're not really even songs. Characters occasionally walk around sing/talking, but the songs, like the film, have no structure and just sort of end. Ray Walston, as Popeye's pappy, infuses the film with some verve, but he enters the picture too late to save it. The set looks like the leftover remnants from McCabe and Mrs. Miller (look for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to that film in a whorehouse), and I think many of them were resurrected for Waterworld. The thing with Altman's bad movies, though, is that they're so confidently and spectacularly bad that they almost become entertaining. The ending of Popeye is a disaster, but it's so fascinatingly disastrous that you can't look away.

Williams and Duvall are clearly the best choice for the time, yet the whole thing plays like an amateur high school production. The background characters fight for the most unnecessary mug to pull attention, the music is atrocious, the sound track is strangely quiet and confusing, and too much of the dialogue is left in the hands of the improvisationally challenged. Every frame is a triumph of awkwardness.This movie is the perfect example of bad directing. Every recognizable actor in this movie has done well in other roles, in other films. Yet here, they all seem to be acting in their own personal void, like a room of cats asked to perform choreography; no rhythm, no synthesis, no unified purpose. Only Robert Altman can produce such an attractive travesty of cinema. Seems like a lot of thought went into camera setups, scenery, costumes and color, and the actors were ignored. Like the high school play, the audience wants it to be good and memorable, but ends up cringing as each opportunity for praise is squashed by the performance. Every serious filmmaker should see this movie at least once, to feel what it's like to moan at a screen for 90 minutes.

Dream sequences and images that not only boggle the mind, but turn it inside-out, up-side down, twist and morph and stretch and squeeze it until you're left with little but a vague recollection of what sanity and reality used to feel like. I've seen images that burn themselves into the psyche, haunting the mind and driving mad the most stable and well-grounded person you could think of. I've spent my waking life seeking out the most explicit, graphic, disturbing, demented, nausea-inducing combinations of sight and sound that the deranged depths of the horror cinema world, mainstream and underground, have to offer.And nothing*.NOTHING*.Compares to the mix of emotions brought about by Popeye. Robert Altman is truly an artistic genius, bringing to life a nightmarish world filled with incomprehensibility and pain. Like being a lost in the woods at night, the film evokes a childlike fear and desperation. Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall make an amazing performance as Popeye and Olive, each of them bringing the two-dimensional characters, with all their mannerisms and quirks, to life. The special effects team takes the exaggerations and the subtle fantasy of a comic-turned-cartoon, and apply them to reality as though they were applying paint to a wall. The writers appeared to have taken inspiration, and possibly dialogue, directly from my most wild and nonsensical dreams. The end result is a movie that is, to put it simply, freaky as all hell.Burton, move over. Tarantino, get lost. King, take a hike. Never before has a big budget been devoted to making such a bizarre and erratic film so painstakingly. Never before has so much care and effort been put into making something so surreal, and so staggeringly strange. Popeye is more, much much more than a movie. It is the quintessential iota of human emotion. It is love and hate and laughter and fear rolled into one. It's the worst film that was ever made well. It speaks to the most basic part of humanity the small voice inside all of us that looks, perplexedly, and asks, Why?.In short This film will blow your mind in ways you cannot possibly imagine.(*Note that while Popeye is the most frightening movie I have ever seen, it is not the worst.

Absolutely!! Absolutely!! ABSOLUTELY!!! I guarantee you that there's not a single, solitary funny, or even slightly amusing, moment in this movie's entirety. There isn't. Popeye has got to be one of the ultimate fiasco movies of all time. It wouldn't (and it couldn't) even amuse a 5-year-old child.For all the extensive time, effort, and cost that was obviously put into the design and building of the elaborate and goofy Looney-Tune sets for Popeye, and, not to mention, Robin Williams' special Popeye make-up effects, I'd have thought there'd be, at least, some worthwhile and humorous entertainment value to this flick. But, nope, there wasn't. Popeye was pure G-A-R-B-A-G-E!!.... There's no if's....and's...or, but's, about it.The Popeye cartoon character is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favourite, animated heroes. He's such a dynamic and complex sailor-dude. Popeye ranks right up there with Superman in my books.And, yet, in this flick Robin Williams almost single-handedly succeeded in destroying Popeye's wonderful charm and winning character with his cringe-worthy portrayal. Williams was absolutely pathetic as Popeye. He, literally, rendered Popeye contemptible. I loathed the way he tried to emulate Popeye's gestures and imitate Popeye's unique speech pattern and distinctive chuckle.....Blah! All anybody, in their right mind, has to do is simply watch any one of Popeye's amazing animated shorts from the 1930's or 40's. It doesn't take a genius to immediately realize that there's no comparison here between one of these classic cartoon episodes and this crummy, little excuse of a movie. A simple, short, 7-minute Popeye cartoon from 1938 surpasses this inferior flick by literal miles when it comes to likable characters, genuine humour, and real, honest-to-goodness imagination. "},{"Title":"This Popeye didn't eat his spinach","Date":"10 July 2006","Score":"3 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Some ideas for a film should just be better left alone. One example of this notion is the film Popeye. An adaptation of the comic strip character famous for his spinach-eating antics, Popeye has been loved by millions over the years in his cartoon form. However, as a live-action musical comedy, Popeye proves to be far less enchanting, an exercise in tedium, near-pointlessness and bad songwriting, all rolled up into a two-hour package that will have you wondering if you have been sitting still for much longer.To recite the plot of Popeye (what there is of one) seems to be an almost complete waste of time, but the duty must be performed Popeye (Robin Williams) arrives in the small seaside hamlet of Sweethaven in search of his long lost Poppa, who abandoned him as a child. He takes up temporary residence with the Oyl clan, including the headstrong Olive (Shelley Duvall) who is engaged to Captain Bluto (Paul Smith), who more or less runs the town for the mysteriously unseen Commodore. Popeye meets up with several characters, including Wimpy (Paul Dooley), who loves hamburgers, and the Taxman (Donald Moffat) who hits you up for money for almost every minor item you can think of.Popeye proves to be a somewhat unwelcome soul in Sweethaven, ridiculed for his speech patterns and his quest for his father. When he happens upon Olive trying to get out of her engagement, the two stumble upon an abandoned baby, named Swee' Pea (Wesley Ivan Hurt), and they agree to take care of him together, quickly discovering that he has a knack for predicting the future, an ability that makes him desirable to Bluto, who kidnaps Swee' Pea with the intention of using him to find missing treasure.Popeye was obviously produced with the intention of being a live-action comic strip in every way, full of the kind of outrageous things that can usually only be accomplished on the page with a pen. The characters all have exaggerated mannerisms and speech patterns, mimicking their illustrated alter-egos, and in certain scenes, such as when Popeye is hit by Bluto, for example, he rolls down some stairs in the shape of a hoop, mimicking a visual device a comic artist might use for humor.However, what screenwriter Jules Feiffer and director Robert Altman apparently failed to consider is whether the decision to bring this material to real-life would prove to be a good one. Based on the final results, it is not. The film that unfolds is stultifying boring and lacking in any real purpose. Popeye's characters quickly prove to be wearying, running through the same schtick over and over again, with no depth to their actions. They aren't characters so much as just voices and faces, eliciting dialogue that is either indecipherable (as in the case of many of Popeye's lines) or completely lacking in consequence. There is no depth to these people, it's all just surface. Sure, Popeye was originally a harmless cartoon character, and traditionally had thin plots and limited character development, but those were cartoon shorts or a few panels in a newspaper, but when you jump mediums, you have to adapt to the new medium. Film needs characters and story. Two hours of comic strip antics with no solid character base is a recipe for boredom, and Popeye delivers in spades.It doesn't help that for a film identified as a comedy, it's not funny. I didn't laugh one time in the entire running length of the film. The dialogue is attempting to be funny, but fails miserably. The sight gags are interesting in the sense that you say to yourself Hey, that's a comic strip like gag and you are momentarily interested to the extent Feiffer and Altman went to realize a live-action comic strip, but you still don't laugh. The film was also intended to be a musical (producer Robert Evans wanted the screen rights to Annie, but failed to land them, so he decided to turn Popeye into a musical. Thanks, Robert), but the majority of the songs, aside from the famous Popeye the Sailor Man ditty, are terrible. They are barely songs, with limp music and questionable rhyming, but worst of all, the performers deliver them badly. I am not aware of any of the cast being trained singers, and it shows. Shelley Duval is especially bad in her delivery of one ballad to Popeye, and Robin Williams isn't much better in his numbers.As far as performance, Robin Williams does his best to mimic the Popeye voice, but it makes much of his dialogue difficult to make out (you can tell many of his scenes were redubbed) and Shelley Duval is just annoying as Olive Oyl. This is more the character's fault than the actors, but still, after only a few minutes on screen, you keep hoping Bluto will kidnap Olive, and when he finally does, he doesn't gag her, leaving us to continue to listen to the character's droning voice. The lack of characterization and annoying performance also ensures that there isn't the slightest hint of chemistry to the romance of these characters, they might as well be wooden dolls for all the audience cares. The rest of the cast just fills in the scenery, there are no people for us to remotely care about or be interested in.Yes, Wolf Kroeger's production design is imaginative and many of the actors do resemble their comic counterparts, but is this enough to justify sitting through Popeye? Absolutely not. This is flash over depth, and Popeye proves a thin as tissue paper. If you want to see some Popeye adventures, check out the old cartoons and leave this one on the shelf.

Popeye is looking for his Poppa. He befriends Wimpy but the town is generally unfriendly. Olive Oyl is conflicted about her engagement and about to run away.

There are quite a few acrobats at work but it is not filmed well. There is no energy. It is a lot of blah, and a lot of groans. There is a general ugliness to the whole affair.

Then there's Shelley Duvall, also committed, but sometimes dropping character, in frustrating moments. All the characters are predictably one-dimensional, the violence and action is entirely stylized, making the 'mechanics' of the plot frustrating, for some reason. The other problem with Popeye is that, really there isn't much of a story dynamic, or anything for the carefully presented and acted characters to do, they just exist in the lavishly created world that Robert Altman envisioned for them. There's a plot about an evil sailor trying' to steal Popeyes adopted infant Sweetpea, in an attempt to find lost treasure. Plus, of course, Popeye has considerable strength when he eats spinach and can't be messed with.The best I can say about the movie is that its not offensive to young viewers, but its not a great kids movie at all. Secondly, the movie features a number of musical numbers that are completely weak and forgettable. How could such an professional team overlook the fact that the musical score belongs in a high school production? Popeye is essentially a really goofy and unflattering depiction of a little working class seafaring community, with two talented actors and no story.Lastly, the film was released after Superman the Motion Picture, except with less enthusiasm and fanfare.

Made during the era of the New Hollywood's fall from grace in the wake of a string of big-budget flops (Heaven's Gate, One from the Heart, 1941), at times Popeye seems to have a Cimino-like disregard for the audience and inward-turning obsession with its own luxurious, strange production, while at other times it suggests another success for Altman, albeit a modest one, of seemingly summoning an actual, wonderful film out of nowhere, or out of chaos. The film is not exactly enjoyable, but it's so weird as to be fascinating to watch. Altman sets about recreating, with methodical literalness, the crowded panels and Dickensian characters of pre-WW II comic strips, on real sets and with flesh-and-blood actors. Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall play, respectively, Popeye and Olive Oyl, and both, like the rest of the cast, have been made up to look uncannily like E.C. Segar's original characters. As always, Altman gives a lot of attention to the setting, in this case the port town of Sweetpea, a ramshackle collection of precipitously leaning houses with a harbor-full of sunken ships. If anything, Altman's take on the comic is closest to McCabe & Mrs. Miller, bringing Popeye to Sweetpea as a mumbling, against-the-grain outsider. Like John McCabe, Popeye remains outside of the community even as he alone takes on the task of defending it.

Live actors and real sets, however carry an expectation of more reality and the cartoonish  actions (well done though they may have been) simply did not fit into that expectation and thus seemed odd or stupid rather than comical.  The plot/story seemed to be more appropriate for a short cartoon rather than a full-length movie, and the movie thus was dragged down with far too much `fill' that grew tiresome.

The movie has little or no dialogue what so-ever and what dialogue there is seems as if its been improvised on the spot. At times characters are overlapping one another with several different conversations at once and none of them are terribly important. This movie didn't need a dialogue coach- it needed a traffic cop! Some of the characters and performances are forgettable. In particular, the Oil's (Mr. and Mrs. to be exact) are wishy-washy and Mrs. Oil is probably the worst actress in the film. Shelley Duvall does a good job bringing Olive to life, but Olive can be such a flake from time to time that you just want to tell her to put a sock in it.The biggest disappointment was the fact that someone wanted to make this into a musical and the composer/lyricist did a poor job. There are too many musical numbers and almost all are terrible. The opening number, the Sweet Haven national anthem, is not bad, and some of the actual tunes are good, but the lyrics are forgettable. The film could stand a little editing.But despite all of this the film does surprise in some areas. The sets, although they look like something from a Florida theme park, are rather charming for their character. The designers of the film should be applauded for their efforts as the overall appearances of the characters up on the screen were fantastic. The actors really look like Popeye, Bluto, Wimpy, Olive Oil and Poop-Deck Pappy and that's most of their performance right there. But one really gets a kick out of watching these actors, in particular Williams, bring these characters to life. Williams is funny and is probably the only person who could have pulled playing Popeye off. Paul L. Smith, although his dialogue is poor, is Bluto and every time I see him in something else I will always think of him as Bluto. Most of all Paul Dooley does a very memorable performance as Wimpy and brings a certain charm to the character. The late Ray Walston also does good as Poop-Deck Pappy. And also, look for Dennis Franz who plays the part of a thug.It's hard to believe that this is a Robert Altman film but it does have his MASH-touch stamped on it. I don't think however that Altman did the film free of any studio executive interference, which would explain the disappointing final result.The best way to describe POPEYE is that its probably one of the best-bad movies of all time.

The film is splendidly cast, most notably with Robin Williams (in his first feature role) as Popeye the Sailor, Shelly Duvall as Olive Oyl, and Ray Walston as Poopdeck Pappy. The story is perfunctory but entertaining, the art direction and set design are perfectly suited to the film, and the town of Sweethaven is flush with comical characters creating a believable live-action cartoon world. It would seem that with all these elements, you couldn't go wrong.Well, you can.Director Robert Altman must have let the actors have free reign of the characters - a wise move as all the actors really seem to be totally into their roles. Unfortunately, the film is so badly staged and paced that the viewer becomes impatient for things to move along. There are many comical moments in the film, but they are stretched and overplayed to the point of becoming annoying. The slapstick concept seems lost on the director...that Charlie Chaplin wasn't funny because he dressed in mismatched, ill-fitting clothes or acted silly he was funny because he had brilliant comic timing. The gags in Popeye have no sense of timing at all.Perhaps the worst offense of pacing and timing in the film is the boat chase. It's set to uptempo bluegrass banjo music, but features two rickety, pokey, slow-moving barges. Sounds kinda amusing, except that it goes on WAY TOO LONG. Fast paced music, slow paced chase it just doesn't work.It was an ambitious idea, and great care was taken in the casting. Even  the baby playing Swee' Pea was obviously chosen for his hysterical lopsided, winking grin. Indeed, every single penny of the budget is up there on the screen.

It's funny because a couple days earlier I was telling a friend of mine that I never turn off a movie no matter how much I hate it because you never know if something good will eventually happen. The first ten minutes of this film had me bored to tears. By the twenty-minute mark I was ready to scratch my eyes out. By the thirty-minute mark I was thinking of ways to kill myself but then the film got slightly better but then again, I still hated it. Robin Williams as Popeye, Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl and Paul L. Smith as Bluto were certainly great choices to play the parts but the screenplay here is so God-awful that not even God himself could have pulled the film off. For starters, I'm really not sure what the plot was suppose to be about as it seemed like they were just remaking various cartoons and putting them in any order that they felt like. There's never a complete story to pull us through an extremely long running time of 114-minutes. The movie is remarkably flat, lacks any real energy and I'm not sure what Altman was doing in the director's chair. The musical numbers were also very poorly written and come off very lame and pathetic. I did end up laughing at a few scenes including the boxing match and another scene where Popeye meets his father. I know this film had a troubled history and I even read that Dustin Hoffman was originally going to play Popeye and I'm really curious how that would have turned out. There must be some secret to this film because there have been a lot of great reviews for it but whatever people like Roger Ebert saw in this thing went right over my head.

However, a great measure of a children's work is its ability engage adults as well. I saw part of Popeye while I was in college, and was quickly disenchanted.Everything missed the mark in this movie. The sets tried for a charming seediness, but were just plain scummy. The characters were built up as well as any player in a 3-minute cartoon. The music was flat and unimaginative, ranging from commotion to flat-out tedium. And the movie was way too long.Instead of a feature-length film, it would have worked much better as a 20-minute short, maybe even a short TV special. A faster pace would have overcome a lot of the film's weaknesses.Definitely not The Wizard of Oz or Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

In fact, all of the cast is very true to the old cartoons. Shelley Duvall looks and sounds like Olive Oyl, Paul Smith plays a great Bluto, and Paul Dooley plays an excellent Wimpy. The sets look like something out of the Popeye cartoons, but at the same time they look dull and low budget. Whoever had the idea to make this a musical, had a good idea, but in order to make this a good movie musical it needed good songs. The songs are awful! Some of the tunes are okay, but the lyrics are so terribly uninspired it's amazing! Often the songs just repeat themselves including, He Needs Me sung over and over by Olive Oyl and I'm Mean sung numerous times in a row by Bluto. This movie had so much potential, and with director Robert Altman, it seems like it couldn't fail, but it did.Maybe Popeye just wasn't meant to have a 2 hour live action musical.My rating ** out of ****. 114 mins. PG for mild language and violence.

(It aired immediately before or after Officer Joe Bolton and the Three Stooges.) Naturally, I was hoping for  memories in overdrive when I rented Popeye with Robin Williams and Shirley Duvall but I was terribly disappointed. Instead of recalling Captain Jack to mind, it was Jack the Dripper. If you want to make a funny movie, you do not splash ten jokes across the screen simultaneously. POPEYE was not without artistic intentions but the result was a fabled cartoon character as seen by Jackson Pollock.   "},{"Title":"Robin Williams playing Popeye had so much more potential","Date":"23 September 2009","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" I first became familiar with the famous cartoon character, Popeye, in the late 90's, when I was around ten years old. I think an old comic book I read introduced me to him. I had no idea that a live action movie featuring the main character plus other characters from the cartoons had ever been made until towards the end of 2001, when I saw a bit of it on TV and saw who was playing Popeye, Robin Williams. To this day, I haven't seen any of Popeye's animated cartoons, nor have I ever been an avid fan of the comics, but have finally seen this entire live action movie from start to finish. Beforehand, I saw its low rating here, but also knew a lot of people seemed to like it, so I decided to watch it with an open mind. Nonetheless, it was not entertaining for the most part.Popeye is a sailor with muscular forearms who rows his boat one stormy night to a seaside town called Sweethaven. After going around the town and meeting various people, with some negative reactions, he arrives at the Oyls' boarding house, where he rents a room. He quickly falls in love with the daughter of the family, Olive, but this leads to trouble, as Bluto, a big bully in the town, is to marry her. The sailor also meets a hamburger loving man named Wimpy. During Popeye's stay in this town, he accomplishes a lot with his fighting skills, which brings him a lot of attention from the townspeople, and also, with Olive Oyl, he finds an abandoned baby boy and names him Swee'Pea. However, one man who is hard to take on is Bluto, who wants revenge on Sweethaven after Olive dumps him, and it's up to Popeye to try and stop the ruffian! The part at the beginning with Popeye on his way to Sweethaven is a little tedious, but after that, as the sailor sings his way through the town as he meets some of its residents, it is pretty funny. However, it soon goes back downhill after that, I think when he makes it to the boarding house. For the rest of the film, it drags on and is rarely funny. I did laugh a bit here and there, during parts of the boxing match, and the part where Popeye meets his long-lost father, but most of the film isn't very funny at all. In addition to the lack of humour, there's also too much talking, and as a musical, some of the songs aren't bad, but a couple songs sung by Olive Oyl, played by Shelley Duvall, are ridiculously repetitive. Even if that's for comic effect, it's not funny, and it doesn't help that Duvall sounds quite bad singing in her Olive Oyl voice. Robin Williams does a decent job playing the starring role, but unfortunately, that is overshadowed by the film's flaws.Since I've usually never paid attention to the Popeye cartoons (comics and animations), I can't really make comparisons between them and this full-length live action adaptation. However, I have seen several other films starring Robin Williams, so I can make comparisons between this film and others I've seen featuring the comedian. It appears he made his silver screen debut in Popeye, and while not all the films he has starred in since then are that good, he has definitely been in much better ones than this. This film is not lacklustre because of Williams, he seems like a great choice for the role of Popeye, but because of the problems I've mentioned, it still fails to deliver. Despite how much criticism this movie has faced, a lot of people would disagree with what I've said about it. We're all entitled to our opinion, but I've given my two cents' worth.

There he meets Olive Oyl, who is about to be engaged to the large Bluto. Popeye finds a baby, Swee'pea, and he 'adopts' it.The movie doesn't have much of a storyline and may be one of the most boring and slow movies of all time, but it is a classic. With fantastic direction, costumes, and casting - Popeye is a film every Popeye cartoon fan must see... or maybe not.The film is overlong and boring, and the Excellent film-making doesn't make it more enjoyable. I can't see how any child could find this enjoyable.The characters are loyal to the cartoon strip - Popeye still talks to himself and mutters, Olive still does what she use to, Bluto still is mean, and Wimpy still likes his burgers.Watch it, but a warning - It will put you to sleep! 2/5 (4/10) Notes It's a Critic's movie, read many critics reviews - Roger Ebert, Critics on Rotten Tomatoes, etc. and the reviews will be Positive. - On IMDb it's got an average 4.7/10.Normal people don't want to see a movie with great film-making, they want a good story.

The main problem is that Altman opted to turn this into a draggy moosikal which was Not a good idea to begin with, instead if they'd gone for more of a Rocketeer or Roger Rabbit feel-ramp up the action, be nostalgic AND coherant, the audience woulda gotten it better.But lemme be perfectly Nixon clear--this thing made $$$.

This attempt to mix live-action with cartoon capers, at best jars your nerves, and at worst sends you screaming for your psychiatrist. It just does not work on any level.

Every last painstaking detail is there and the movie looks like you have fallen into a color version of one of these short cartoons. And with this, we come to the heart of the problem. The Popeye cartoons were a bit bland to begin with but they only lasted about 8 minutes but this flick lasts nearly 2 hours!!! To base one movie on ONE joke (and not a funny one at that) is to create an endurance contest for the viewer. I couldn't stand how bored I became and ultimately turned off the video. So, in all fairness, the last 20 minutes COULD have elevated this movie to a 2 or 3-star rating but based on the tediousness I witnessed, this is extremely unlikely. Watch this only if you are an insomniac or are an absolutely die-hard Popeye fan. Don't say I didn't warn you! "}]
