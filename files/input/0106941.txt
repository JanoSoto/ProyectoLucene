Fox and Gabrielle Anwar, apart from the singing, it ends up as a deeply entertaining and enjoyable movie to sit back and relax with a loved one over at the end of a tiring week.This movie never actually got a video release in the U.K. which has greatly disappointed me and means I have to wait for its repeat appearance on TV in order to add it to my collection.Nevertheless, Fox excels yet again and shows why he is one of the few American sitcom stars to make a prolonged impact in the movies in roles unlike his character from Family Ties. Anwar also gives another performance which leaves me increasingly baffled as to why she has not been used more in Hollywood.See this movie, it may not have been a hit but it will surprise you with its quality just the same.

It's quick and efficient, it does its job well, but it's not something you're going to think much about ten minutes after you see it (now, now, don't get greedy).Why do I like it? Fox. And I don't consider myself a big Michael J. Fox fan, I mean, he was good in Family Ties, but that was a long time ago and he's done some stinkers between then and now. Maybe because the smooth talker consierge he plays in this reminds me a little of Alex P. Keating back in the day. This guy is super-slick, his mind is always going at incredible speeds. One part that will always stand out is the 'ticket trade' scene (How'd this Donahue get in here?). Funny stuff. There are a few good laughs in here.Oops, can't forget Gabrielle Anwar. She is just cute as a button in this movie, I want to see more of her (the only other movie of hers I can think of off hand is Body Snatchers). Heck, you can almost forgive her for basically playing a prostitute in this one. If you don't agree,ask yourself this Would she have taken any of this guys crap if he was a married garbage man from New Jersey and not a married european millionaire fashion mogul? Of coarse not, she's in it for the money. Hell, i'd wear a skirt and put out for that kind of scratch.The director Barry Sonnenfeld has an interesting resume of hits (Men in Black) and misses (Wild Wild West) and just entertaining films (Get Shorty). This one is entertaining fluff. It's an hour and a half of your time that you won't regret spending. 7/10 stars. G'night!

It's got everything - love, romance, dream, struggle, deception, insecurity, fear and hope. Its happy ending comes from the heart, not from the formula. Part of the reason the movie works so well is the screenplay which has got it right at all the right points. Some people say it's not funny enough, well, as far as I am concerned, for the genre of romantic comedy, it's very humorous (my personal favorite line is how did my secretary get here? - priceless!!).Second, the sincere and very endearing performances of the cast. The WHOLE cast. As for the lead, Concierge happens to be my favorite MJF's film. He is so natural in this, it doesn't even feel like he is acting. Gabrielle Anwar gives a pretty solid performance as well, and the chemistry between Andy and Doug is overwhelming. Well, pretty much every character is well written and acted and stands out on his/her own - Mr. Drinkwater, Milton, Mr. Himmelman, Julian Russel, Mr. Wegman... I find the Doug-Wegman plot line particularly dear and I shed a couple of tears every time Mr. Wegman tells Doug he is going to invest the money and make Doug's dream come true.I also think this movie has one of the best turning points (or one hour crisis points) ever. Again, my heart starts beating faster every time when Doug tells Andy about the hotel of his dreams as he narrates the unfortunate story of his father. I am not going to be a 59 year old bellhop, says Doug. Concierge... - corrects him Andy. The roles are reversed here, before Doug had insisted to be called concierge instead of bellhop and now Andy calls him that. We see how, for the first time, Andy realizes that Doug is not her lover's puppet, but an individual, a person with a great hope and a great dream.Overall, it's a wonderful family film to watch on a rainy day, right between The Apartment and Sideways. Well, you can enjoy it even it you haven't got a family. It still works.

Fox) is a master of deals as concierge in the classy Bradbury hotel. He has a heart of gold protecting some of the older workers from manager Mr. Himmelman. He even takes care of a cheapskate guest like Harry Wegman. Ed Drinkwater from the IRS is on his case. He dreams of owning his own hotel and he hopes billionaire investor Christian Hanover is his ticket. He is infatuated with store perfume girl Andy Hart (Gabrielle Anwar) who claims to have a boyfriend. It turns out she's Hanover's mistress and he's forced to cover for Hanover as he needs the deal more.This is a barely functional romance. It's mostly riding on the shoulders of Michael J. Fox and he's plenty charming by himself. The romance is questionable. It's not well set up and a bit more back story could have helped. The villain is underwhelming. Overall this is a watchable and unimpressive rom-com. "},{"Title":"Those Were The Days","Date":"15 November 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" There are certain type of movies you look back on and think that those days are gone. This movie is one of them. An incredibly sweet story, with no logic and...quite frankly...a very dark message. I see what director Barry Sonnenfeld was doing. He's balancing the line between slapstick and fairy tale. Not much different than what Billy Wilder did, except...I know now why those films only exist within their time.Fox plays a concierge who has bigger dreams beyond the bellhop mentality. He gets in business with a man, who (and I'm not ruining it, since it's in the trailer) whose affair with a younger woman is now Fox's duty. Unfortunately for him, he has a flirtatious history with her. You see where the script borrows from The Apartment. He's crestfallen that his feelings towards her may or may not trump his dreams. I can see Fox channeling his inner Jack Lemmon, but something is greatly amiss. I think, it's because there's so much fat in the story that you are just always waiting for something interesting to happen. Take for example, the candy shop lady who is pestering him about his love life. The inexplicable banter between a Chinese food delivery boy and himself (perhaps to illustrate his loneliness).Then you have the obligatory Barry Sonnenfeld wide angle, collective shot. It's very uneven where he places these moments. Works fantastic in Men In Black somehow falls short here. The very lovely Gabrielle Anwar seems SO uncomfortable playing the other woman. She has the look, just not the depth. Something missing, but I can't put my finger on it. Somehow, the Shirley MacClaines's Fran Kubliak sweetness was suppose to be injected here. But Anwar doesn't seem to commit. In fact, there is a vomiting scene in this movie, reminiscent of when she attempts her suicide.I like the fairy tale quality of this movie. And the music, as usual, leaves a swell in your heart. It's not terrible. It's perfectly fine for its time.

Nothing could be farther from the truth from that statement. He is the concierge at a Manhattan hotel who is totally sympathetic to the people working there.The story basically revolves around the fact that Fox likes the perfume girl behind the counter, only to find out that she is the mistress of a wealthy, nasty frequent visitor to the hotel. Shall we say that Fox and the guy continually do each other favors.The Bob Balaban role as an IRS agent quickly falls apart and Fyvush Finkel as an elderly employee make the film shine.The film does go down in the sense that there are too many intricate situations occurring.

Fox Makes A Pretty Weak Script Entertaining...","Date":"18 February 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" While this movie is certainly not one that stands out about all other Fox movies, it's entertaining nonetheless due to Michael J. Fox's innate charm and it's fun to see his attempts at juggling a demanding investor, eccentric clients and an eclectic group of co-workers all while trying to figure out if he should go for the girl... or the property he wants. The script is really quite weak but the way it's shot is brilliant and Sonnefeld's direction makes it flow quite effortlessly. It's an hour-and-a-half and change movie that only feels like it takes an hour to sit through. I agree with the others who said it's a good movie to watch on a rainy day, or just when you're in the mood for a feel-good (though granted not laugh-out-loud) comedy. The funniest scenes are with the elderly bellhop and the parrot. Incidentally, the parrot was almost as good as Michael J. Fox in this movie (that's not an insult to Fox, by the way; the bird is just that funny--- definitely something you have to see to believe). I recommend it, but will everyone like it? No, in fact, some won't be able to sit through it because it can get slightly boring in parts. If you have patience though and a true love for Fox's work, you'll find it quite charming. 6/10 stars.

Fox offers one of his strongest performances in FOR LOVE OR MONEY, a predictable yet entertaining comedy that bears more than a passing resemblance to the 1960 classic THE APARTMENT. Fox plays Doug, the slick concierge at a fancy Manhatten hotel who becomes caught between an unscrupulous businessman (Anthony Higgins), who he's hoping will help to finance his dream of his own hotel and his mistress (Gabrielle Anwar), a department store clerk and aspiring singer who refuses to accept the fact that the man is married and will never leave his wife. Fox gives his best performance since BACK TO TO THE FUTURE as a fast talking yet utterly charming con artist with impeccable people skills which have become both a benefit and a detriment where his work is concerned. Anwar is an attractive leading lady and Higgins is appropriately smarmy as the villain of the piece. An intelligent screenplay and noteworthy supporting turns by Michael Tucker as a hotel guest and Fyvesh Finkle as a senile bell hop are icing on the cake for this smart little comedy that went virtually unnoticed at the time of its release but provides breezy entertainment.
