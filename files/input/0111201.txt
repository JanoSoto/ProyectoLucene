You either like it or you don't! For those who didn't like and posted here, I am surprised you took such elaborate measures to critique it to the umpteenth degree. Had the movie been heralded as The Greatest Movie Ever Made, I would better understand your criticism. However, since it was not, it doesn't really deserve the harshness of some of the posts in here. If your expectations were not fulfilled, its not the fault of the movie! And I'll bet dollars to do-nuts that the majority of the people who went to see this movie went to satisfy their curiosity regarding the nudity. Of all the scenes in this flick that have been talked about in these postings, the most obvious tongue in cheek scene has been overlooked. At the end, Lindsay walks into a building and tosses a hammer to the blind man sitting on a cot and says 'lets get to work'............the blind man deftly catches the hammer and gets up. For all those whose comments are detracting, at least give the author a little more credit for inserting that, so obvious, yet unmentioned.

This film provides us with the stark contrast of the repressed preacher from London and the artist's three models in rural Australia, a throwback to Shakespeare's Green World. The fulcrum of this contrast is the preacher's wife, being pulled in both the oppressive, moral direction by her upbringing and her husband and the free and expressive direction of the artist.  The breathtaking cinematography and stunning visual symbolism of this film contribute to make it into a powerful attack on the Christian moral code that dominates western thinking. I have been scoffed at on more than one occasion for praising Sirens, but I left the theater questioning my own views about what is and is not moral. The fact that this film's sexual content seems to invalidate it as art in many people's eyes merely underscores the value of its message.  Along with Sling Blade, Sirens to me stands as the most provocative film about morality made in the 1990's.  A solid 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.

Luckily I saw it in Australia and it wasn't edited for content. I found it refreshing and intelligent. Set in the 1920's, it's about a reverend and his wife who travel to the Outback of Australia to tame down an artist (played well by Sam Neil) who has been creating lewd paintings. In the end, the film successfully criticizes religion's hang ups about sex. The reverend, of course, plays the part of conservative who is against these paintings that he deems are pornographic. During the course of the film he has several opportunities to explain his objections. While the film ultimately suggests that he is wrong, it still allows us to understand the reverend's point-of-view and perhaps even sympathize with it. The most remarkable thing about this character was his some things are best left untold stance concerning his wife's misbehaviors. This was a brilliant unexpected twist for me. At no point in the movie is the reverend made out to be a villain. Rather, he is presented as an intelligent and forgiving man, who just happens to be conservative about sex. With that said, I do not believe criticizing religion's view of sex was the main purpose of this film. The true story -- related but not the same -- was about the reverend's wife finding her own repressed sexuality while also well-aware of her husband's views which she initially shared. She is the heroine of the film. She makes a journey, encounters inner conflict, and returns changed by her experiences for the better (or we are led to believe). Any review of Sirens would be incomplete if it failed to comment on the sex scenes. They are explicit but nothing to be alarmed about especially considering this film targets a purely adult audience. The sex scenes are tastefully done even if they are built on lust instead of love. If I may venture an opinion, I think most women will find this movie very erotic. Take for instance, the perpetually bare-chested muscular blind guy. This character fulfills no other purpose than to incarnate female sexual desires. Men however will not find this film very arousing. It explores the sexual desires of women not men. But there are plenty of beautiful naked women to kept them interested even if the story doesn't. But as a man, I enjoyed the movie too. (I can't even recall any film attempting to explore men's sexual desires artfully at this moment...) In summery, a very good film that is thought-provoking and well-done. 7/10 "},{"Title":"An erotic little romp","Date":"18 March 2004","Score":"31 out of 38 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"     Sirens seems to have touched a nerve here.  Some reviewers dismiss it as derivative soft-core drivel.  Others love it.  It probably helps to know that there's little derivative about the story-it's based on real people and a real incident.    Sam Neill's character--Norman Lindsay--was real.  Lindsay, a prolific artist and novelist, was also a libertine living a Hugh Hefner lifestyle when the rest of the world was awakening from the Victorian Age.    Sirens was filmed at the Lindsay home and gallery, a 40-acre estate now run by the Australian National Trust.  The artworks are all Lindsay's.  And the storyline is based on an incident in which the Anglican Church dispatched a cleric to convey concerns about The Crucifixion of Venus.    As for the plot, it's simply a humorous retelling of what might have been--with lots of voluptuous nudes and erotic symbolism tossed in for good measure.  Yes, it's all quite predictable.  You know five minutes into the film that the Converters will become the Converted. But it's a fun ride getting to that inevitable destination.      `Sirens' is not for everyone.  If full-frontal male and female nudity offends, you will be offended.  If ridiculing the Church or its values offends, you will be offended.  And if the notion that the cure for a boring marriage is a little extra-marital dalliance offends, you will truly be offended.    Otherwise, it's a little erotic gem and a great way to start an even better evening. )        "},{"Title":"...almost everyday for 1 1/2 years, I watched Sirens...","Date":"14 April 2003","Score":"33 out of 42 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I personally believe this film is so subtle that it cruises under the scope of the average person - no insult intended! So many say they liked this film but... just goes to show how subtle this film really is. The photography is absolutely breathtaking. Film stills would make such a collage - oy! The acting is so right on and precise from each and every actor - the characters so well defined. The story is so exquisitely told...! During the whole movie, I kept expecting that statue (you know the one!) to take off walking. At the end, in the dream sequence when the statue stepped down from her pedestal and walked off into the mist, it nearly blew my mind! The way the story switches back & forth between conscious & unconscious day-to-day experiences so seamlessly amazes me. I fell totally in love w/this movie. I went thru a stage of watching it at least once a day for about 1 1/2 years - almost w/out fail! I am married to an artist. I have been his model. I am a woman. This film speaks to these matters with such clarity it's truly amazing. The transition Tara Fitzgerald's character goes thru in waking up to her womanhood is also an integral and major part of the story. The symbolism of the painting of the dual woman - and her being awakened each night by something in the natural/instinctive world calling her to consciousness. Lucid dreaming - becoming conscious thru internal knowledges calling forth her true nature. Please forgive me for not writing in complete proper syntax. I'm usually much better at expressing myself than this. But my relationship with this film is so very personal as to be abstract in tho't. Plus, I've never tried to express my feelings about Sirens before. I am almost shocked when I read that some of you think it was less than a 10! Predictable?! Maybe you are more on the ball than I am and than I am giving you credit for. Pardon me please! This is one of the all time best movies ever - for me anyway!

Hugh Grant plays the minister who, with his wife, encounters four beautiful models (one is the artist's wife) who bemuse him with their nude romps and sensual ways. Moreover, he's distressed by his wife's apparent interest in the unabashed frolicking. Sirens is a not too serious and somewhat sensual film with a thin plot. The film's appeal is in the moment-to-moment situations, the shangrila feel given to the harsh outback locale, the feminist antics of the bevy of babes, etc. Some will find the film tedious while others will be captivated by it's subtle charms.

After studying the film's critiques and background I slowly came around to appreciate the film's merits, if not completely comfortable with the nudity.  The point is that the nudity is not suppose to be comfortable from the audience point of view.  The story takes place in an almost mystical world untarnished by outside influences and taboos.  It is indeed a wonderful Eden.  As an actress I had to be comfortable within the Eden created on stage, despite being uncomfortable in front of fellow actors and the audience.

I was not prepared for the charm, playfulness, joy and raw sensuality that this film captured.  Sam Neill is the ultimate sensualist, yet indulges his children's fancies with innocent abandon.  Hugh Grant is a likable doofus, and he is far outpaced by Tara Fitzgerald's acceptance of the pleasures of the flesh.  In many ways, this couple reminded me of Brad & Janet in Rocky Horror - the man is either unable or too clueless to accept the sensual awakening that his companion does. Thus, I was pleased at my date's choice of film, and any discomfort of my own at being seduced by the screen on a first date soon passed from my date's reactions to the sexy scenes.  On the anniversary of that date, I paid the outrageous price of $59.95 for a VHS copy, and the repeat viewings were as pleasant as th first.  We later married, and this was her idea, too.P.S.  I recommend The Advocate for those who like Sirens.P.P.S.

I suppose that I am also telling quite a bit of what's going on so, yes, if you haven't seen it, stop here, see it and then come back and see if you don't agree.No, it isn't very deep (as some here have intimated) but it could make you think deep thoughts if you follow the various threads that unfold.Venus Crucified (the blasphemous painting in question) is a pointed reference to the killing of the sacred feminine by the Christian Church (although I do not think that was intended by it's Messiah).The symbolism isn't terribly subtle either, there are snakes in the garden, for sure; but there are a number of references to the savagery of life in mid-twentieth century Australia - people eaten off by sharks and (other) snakes attacking children in a newspaper headline near the end. There was repeated references to the Titanic, too, including, so it seemed, that the minister and his wife may have sailed on it to Australia! (The sirens calling the ship to it's demise? The whole thing a dream of a passenger on that ship?? Who knows, eh?) The symbolism was a bit off in one scene that depicted the minister and bishop going through the museum without looking at any of the wonderful paintings along the gallery on the way to the offensive work; but the church is not above owning a huge collection of art, some of it quite controversial. That bit of 'ignorant indifference' didn't play too well on this viewer; but I suppose it was a jab at the tight-assed attitude of the clergy in general.The girls are charming in the old fashioned sense - just as the original sirens charmed sailors to their doom, they charmed the minister's wife to her 'moral doom'.Dream sequences were, like real dreams, sometimes hard to know if they were 'real' or not - just as Gidy is conned into thinking what she really saw was just her dream; and that dream was 'telling her' to do what she wanted to do in the first place.Near the end when Devlin catches the hammer, it all fell into perspective, not only for me but for Estella as well.I don't think this film was ever intended to be a deep, heavy look into any morality; it was a bit of a romp through the human condition leaving one with a little fatalistic approach to morality - life has many ugly sides (sharks, snakes, etc.) but leave room for a little fun too. The minister (Anthony/Hugh Grant) also allows that some things are best not told. There is a difference between not telling something and telling a lie, though; and that was left right out.Frankly the morality being sold in this flick is just a bit too frivolous for real life, at least in most settings. People do get hurt, lives are affected, and there are often consequences for those so-called harmless trysts. John Lennon would have us Imagine this and that but in the end he lived the good life off of the proceeds of his capitalistic ventures. That is how life is; this movie is how dreams are. All-in-all, it was nice dream. That's what movies should be; so in being that, it was a very good movie.

Sam Neill plays the artist; the movie is fictional but based on Lindsay's real-life reputation, and is filmed on location on the land he owned in Australia. (Lindsay also wrote Age of Consent, which was made into a 1969 movie with James Mason, about an Australian artist.) Lindsay is a hedonist  whose paintings are lustful, and whose estate is populated by half-nude models and avant garde ideas.The conflict between church-sponsored repression and free love sensuality is played out with strong visual metaphors and not too much dialog. A few arguments about freedom and lust are all that is needed, as the camera work and acting do the rest of the job of  showing us the emergence of erotic feeling as it fights against the desire to be good. Images of snakes and apples abound, but more generally, the untamed is everywhere -- spiders, wombats, rocks that are difficult to climb, woods full of plant and animal life -- nature overflowing is the primary seducer, with Elle MacPherson acting as a kind of sex ex machina, pulling the main characters towards awakening.I loved this movie! The acting is solid, and the cinematography is wonderful.  I caught numerous visual references to other painters of the period, notably Maxfield Parish and John Waterhouse -- one scene towards the end exactly mimics a Waterhouse. I'm sure if I reviewed some art books I'd find even more references. The movie is  gently but compellingly erotic, gradually turning up the heat as much with beauty as with sex. Grant is wonderful as a man who has  concluded that repression is a good and valuable thing (and it's great to see him in a role that doesn't require him to stammer ). Tara Fitzgerald as his wife finds herself less confident in her convictions, and the seduction focuses on her.

This is an artistically valid thing for any film to do, and raises the level of film culture generally, if only a little.I have yet to see anyone commenting on the superb score - this wonderful music by Rachel Portman (whose work I otherwise do not know) is a delight from start to finish, and unlike most movie music, would stand on its own as a concert piece.  The main theme, quirky, cheerful and rhythmically very interesting, seems to take as its inspiration the Vaughan Williams March of the Kitchen Utensils heard at the very start of the film as we follow Hugh Grant's feet walking through the art gallery, but it is very much an excellent piece of music in its own right.  The Dream Variations are suitably dreamy, and coupled with the slow motion photography make for a superb piece of cinema.John Duigan (writer, director) is not often mentioned in the same breath as other well known Australian directors such as George Miller or Peter Weir or Bruce Beresford, but personally I think he stands up with the best of them. A true Auteur (he has scripted most of the films he has directed) his films are always very interesting character studies.  A more well known recent film he made was The Leading Man which starred Jon Bon Jovi as an American actor who comes to London to appear in a West End Play, and is hired by the director to seduce his wife.  As in The Leading Man, Sirens is about the interactions between characters, this providing in my view more than enough in the way of plot and sub-plot.  If Duigan's films always seem to be about human sexuality, well, after all, that is what drives most human relationships, whether we want to admit it or not.  I think what stands out about Duigan's films, and particularly about Sirens, is their total honesty about human sexuality, without (and I know some will disagree) being excessively prurient.A final line - I love the helicopter shot at the very, very end of the film. It is a beautiful, painterly landscape scene (which fades out *just* too soon), but one's love of its beauty is strengthened by one's admiration of the five actresses, who had to climb to the top of this sheer-looking rocky outcrop and remove all their clothes for the shot!  They have my appreciation, and my sympathy!

Eroticism is a thought process instead of a catalog of acts and its good to see a film that recognizes this.  I appreciate the film's subtle approach to its subject.  The film is not about sex as much as it is about the characters' evolving views and attitudes toward sex.  Films rarely concentrate on ideas and theme.  It's good to see a film that does that.And, let's be clear, I don't mind seeing Tara Fitzgerald and Elle MacPhereson naked either.Having gotten that out of the way, I should say that Fitzgerald and MacPhereson both give good performances, (whether naked or clothed).

Elle MacPherson can act! And so can Hugh Grant!I decided to give Grant another look in honor of his honorable role in exposing the phone hacking of celebrities by Rupert Murdoch's tabloids. I did not like Notting Hill because I couldn't shake the feeling Grant was just being Grant; Mickey Blue Eyes was better, but still marginal acting. I used to call him Hugh One Grin Grant because he only seemed to have two expressions a wide grin and a deep frown. But perhaps part of the problem was the shallow material he had to act in. Or, more likely, I have not seen his best work. Sometimes actors do their most authentic work early on, and Sirens might qualify. But now I am curious what Grant will do next, presumably not for Fox Studios.With Sirens, Hugh Grant gets it right. He conveys a broader range of moods and emotions, though there are no histrionics. He relaxes out of his usual Hugh Grant persona, but not too much, as he is a British clergyman, though a relatively liberal one. He is confronted with a variety of unusual and embarrassing situations, where his reaction is key to the movie, and he gets it right. This time, it looks genuine. This time there is real chemistry with his co-star.I never would have guessed Elle MacPherson was a supermodel rather than an actress. There is none of the stiffness seen with some of the great beauties turned actresses of years past. Maybe she was just being herself, but whatever it is, I hope she keeps on doing it.The greatest actor of the cast is Sam Neill, though you might not guess it. Neill, who plays the real Norman Lindsay, provides the grounding for the story. He hardly says anything, but sometimes that is the performance that requires the most talent. And he is the one with the grin, though a subtle, sly one of understanding. (Mr. Grant, with all due respect, you don't need to flash a wide grin all the time. Look at Neill's more subtle grin which uses his eyes -- this could look good on you, too. Or you could just smile gently and sagely.)Tara Fitzgerald (not to be confused with Geena Davis) had by far the most challenging and central role, which she played to perfection. Doesn't exactly look like a vicar's wife, though. But neither does Grant. I also liked her in the delightful Hear My Song.Music is by Rachel Portman, as fans of Chocolat might guess. The opening theme matches one in Chocolat. But most of the rest of the score is original and interesting. The shared musical theme is appropriate since the two movies share a sexual theme of repression and liberation. They both hark back to the Bacchae. Chocolat came later, and has the stronger score, but then it is a stronger movie. Sirens is more low-keyed. What is especially interesting about Sirens is not the plot, but the atmosphere of place and time it conveys, and the odd mood of the odd situation. This mood runs through the movie, and the music plays a role in sustaining that mood. There isn't so much of a plot as a situation, which is off-balanced and gives the story momentum. You naturally wonder how it will unfold, and that is what holds your interest.Some reviewers make a big deal about the similarity to a D.H. Lawrence novel, but I think Sirens is better, less dark and more willing to laugh at itself. And its actual source was a real painter, whose works appear in the film. It is fitting, under the circumstances, that Sirens is set in Australia, the home of Rupert Murdoch, who would have been born around the time of the movie, which is set in the 1930s. The impression of Australians, men at least, in this outback town is hardly favorable. They don't seem to set much store in manners or grooming. But then Neill's painter character doesn't place much store in pretension, either, unlike the British. I guess there can be something said for that. I wonder if we can find any of Murdoch's roots in these characters?Some people will watch Sirens for the beautiful women. But John Duigan - - director, writer and bit player -- has created a truly original, interesting movie, something you don't encounter every day.

I saw this film again for the first time in years recently. It's a film we used to watch quite often throughout the 90's.Well - for one thing this film has personal resonances for us because we saw the film in Australia when it came out. Also - we lived not far from the idyllic house where Lindsay lived - the centre-piece of the film. Yes - you can visit the house (National Trust for Australia) just off the road between Sydney and Katoomba in the Blue Mountains National Park. We visited several times and always loved it. It meant more that we knew something of Lindsay through his works and this film.This is a curious film - rather a silly film in a lot of ways. Sure - its themes are pretty obvious; sexual suppression and awakening, libertarian/counter-cultural views. Other reviewers have disliked the nude/moral/anti-Christian elements of the film - but I can't agree with them. Sirens is about exploding the myths of the female body and the taboos associated with female sexuality and female self-awareness and it does this in a way which to my mind doesn't offend or depart from the reality of the human experience. You can enjoy Sirens for allowing the exploration of these issues from the peace and tranquillity of your living room chair. Some reviewers have seen deeper themes. If there is anything more it's to do with feminine sisterhood, bonding and peer identity. But I'm not sure - it would depend on the viewers life experience. Watch Sirens - decide for yourself.The light-hearted way of the movie is upheld throughout by the excellent music, great use of the magnificent Blue Mountains scenery, the easy dialogue and simple plot.The silly parts concern the treatment of the Australian locals, eg, the old drunk who only says get f*****d, the leering children and scenes in the rugged bar - where the locals show their contempt for the Lindsay crowd whom they mistrust and don't understand. This is handled in a way which makes country Australians in the 1930's look stupid and ignorant to the point of complete separation from any of the moral considerations of Lindsays artistic world as seen here. It's an unnecessary weakness in the construction of the film. The other sillinesses concern the throw on Australian animals; at one point a wallaby is thrown at Tara Fitzgerald - it's hysterical! But I enjoyed the film. It's photographed beautifully. It's a simple low-budget piece that relies on its story, the power of it's messages and images. The acting which whilst not brilliant - is not poor. It's not a great film - but doesn't try to be. If you want to see something of Australia and a fun film that doesn't take itself too seriously - then SIRENS is worth a watch.

For instance, when Anthony and Estella first arrive, they are the only characters who aren't sunburnt in the least - it makes them stand out. I wonder whether it is a coincidence that Estella has straight, cropped hair whereas Sheela, Giddy and Pru have all this long, flowing, wavy hair - it seems to suggest emotional repression somehow. Estella's early repression is shown really well in a scene at dinner - she is shocked to hear a little girl announce I'm so bloody bored and you can even see her shake when she's annoyed - all without the flailing arms and screaming or shouting you might see from any other character on film during a moment of anger.I also liked the sequence of movement shots right at the start - from two pairs of feet walking through a gallery to Anthony and Estella carrying the huge trunk along the street. The landscapes are lovely and one shot I really found interesting was the one showing the point of view from the car as it drives towards the house. The casual appearance of creatures like lizards and spiders are well-placed - sort of like an incidental feature of Australia.I'm no Hugh Grant fanatic and neither do I loathe him, but in the first few minutes, I started to understand why he might have been inclined in more recent years towards characters such as Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary. The little trademark smirks, the eye movements and above all the hair are ever present - would somebody please cast Hugh Grant in a role that demands short hair? Or even baldness? He seems to have the same hairstyle in everything - Four Weddings, The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill, Bridget Jones . . . If you're looking for a film with a lot of action, this probably isn't for you - it took me a while to decide when and if the plot had actually got going. I think it's too extreme to say that the girls are exploring temptation - after all, what they're doing wouldn't be that shocking at all today - but the moral code of the time is stated so implicitly that the audience knows it's outrageous without anyone actually having to say it. The only slightly weak point I could find relates to the dreamlike moments - you're not sure whether it's real or whether it isn't.This is one of the few films I've seen where it's clear that characters have developed emotionally between the beginning and the end - the scene on the train is not one that I think the Estella of the film's opening would have initiated.

They are only meant to be there for one night but after the next train is derailed they find themselves staying much longer than planned. Estella gets to know Lindsay's models and rather quickly the setting starts to have an effect on her; or lowers her sexual inhibitions to let her be who she really was.Given that this film only has a '15' certificate it is surprisingly erotic at times; it manages to avoid being sleazy though. The story is simple enough but well told. Hugh Grant is good as Anthony Campion, although it is a role like many he has played&#x85; the rather flustered Englishman. The best acting comes form Tara Fitzgerald; to my mind she is the real star of this film as it is far more about her character than that of her husband; her portrayal of Estella's gradually growing sexual feelings is done believably and her pale complexion stands in contrast to the tanned Australians. The rest of the cast are also pretty good; including Elle Macpherson who is obviously much better known for her modelling work.

Estella, who's sexually repressed due to her sect's Victorian legalism, experiences a sexual awakening after befriending the (mostly) nude models on Lindsay's breathtaking estate (Elle Macpherson, Kate Fischer, Portia de Rossi and Pamela Rabe). Mark Gerber has a fairly significant role as a blind/mute handyman hunk.Norman Lindsay is considered one of Australia's greatest artists -- a painter, illustrator, sculptor and writer -- who didn't pass away till 1969. He was known for his artistic diligence and high output. Although he did a lot of nude works they're hardly pornographic (google them). This plus the fact that his mother was the daughter of Wesleyen missionaries makes it doubtful that he was ever intentionally blasphemous. Some of his works were considered controversial simply due to lingering Victorian mores at the time.Although the movie poster and DVD cover feature Grant and Macphereson, the movie's really about Fitzgerald's character, Estella, and her potentially positive transformation despite possible moral failure. Speaking of the poster/cover, the shot of Grant is horrible as he looks like a butch lesbian more than he does himself (no offense to butch lesbians).Also speaking of the DVD cover, the film has been mis-advertised as a comedy-drama when actually it's not a comedy at all. Although there are a few amusing moments, this is squarely an adult drama about Lindsay's awe-inspiring estate providing the liberating environment for Estella from the cage of religious legalism. I'm not necessarily saying that everything that goes on at the estate is good or morally healthy -- in fact, I'm not saying that at all -- but Lindsay was an artist who naturally rejected all confining parameters; as such, his manor and the surrounding wilderness provide the freedom-inducing atmosphere necessary for Estella's succor from Victorian sterility.Fitzgerald, Grant and Sam Neill (Lindsay) are excellent in their roles and Macphereson gained weight for her first film in order to properly depict one of Lindsay's voluptuous models. As far as the models go, Portia de Rossi steals the show as the more-modest Giddy.Due to the many references to the Titanic and various other sea tragedies some have erroneously interpreted the film as the delusions of a victim of the Titanic, but this is canceled out by the fact that the story takes place roughly 18 years after that shipwreck and also because the filmmakers themselves deny such a claim on the DVD commentary. This isn't to say, however, that a viewer can't interpret the film in this creative manner because film, like all artistic works, are open to the viewer's personal interpretation.The shots of the Titanic are actually metaphors for the iceberg of female sexuality that the Titanic of Estella's sexual repression was heading for. The message of the film is simple yet powerful All women are sirens, even those locked in a confining zeitgeist, organization or belief system. In light of the story's context and the protagonist's character arc, the film is no more anti-Christian than the story of David and Bathsheba or Tamar and Judah (Genesis 38) in the Bible.As far as comparisons go, Sirens stands alone, but the contemporaneous The Piano isn't far off. They're both adult historical dramas released the same year and their stories take place in the same part of the world. While The Piano is certainly a quality adult drama, Sirens edges it out by quite a margin.The film runs a short-but-sweet 98 minutes and was shot on Lindsay's estate in Faulconbridge, New South Wales, and the surrounding Blue Mountains area.GRADE A- "},{"Title":"Nudes, nudes, nudes!","Date":"14 October 2010","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This film covers up a rather muddled main story with a lot of charm and a lot of nudity. It works pretty well as a travelogue of both the Australian countryside and Elle Macpherson's breasts, but it depends too much on the audience coming into the film with a certain predisposition.Anthony Campion (Hugh Grant) is an English clergyman in the 1930s who's been sent to Australia to deal with a controversial artist. The paintings of Norman Lindsay (Sam Neill) splash nudity and blasphemy across the canvas and Campion is sent to ask him to provide some less provocative work for an exhibition. Campion and his wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) travel to Lindsay's home and spend several days there, Campion arguing with Lindsay and Estella getting caught up with the sexually precocious models that live with Lindsay. Essentially, the movie is about Estella overcoming her button down and conventional morality through the Sapphic-tinged attentions of a model named Sheela (Elle Macpherson) and the lovelorn neediness of another model named Giddy (Portia De Rossi). A handyman named Devlin (Mark Gerber), who seems to be straight out of a Harlequin romance novel, also figures into the mix.This definitely isn't a movie you'll enjoy because of its story. It establishes Campion and Lindsay quite well as a devout but cultured man of God and an intellectual version of Hugh Hefner, respectively. Those two characters don't do very much, though. The other characters are either broadly or obviously drawn and are more like props than people. Even Estella, who's clearly becomes the main character in the movie, isn't defined as much more than a typical, middle class Englishwoman of the early 20th century, with all the generic sort of reserve and pluck than implies.Sirens is supposed to be about the sensual awakening of Estella. The problem is it never bothers to explain why she needs to be awoken. Outside of a bout of passionless sex with their pajamas on that happens late in the story, the movie doesn't explore or explain or display what's wrong with the way Campion and Estella are. Indeed, Campion is put forth as a well-adjusted Christian man while the audience is left to merely assume that Estella is repressed and unhappy. By not establishing that something is disordered or unhealthy with Estella, the film takes away any sense of purpose or significance to her journey to sexual fulfillment. It's like the audience is supposed to naturally understand there's something terribly leaden and cold about being a middle class Englishwoman in the early 20th century.I'm not sure Sirens would be much of a film if it weren't for the plentiful nudity on display but there is a lot of it, it's high quality and there's something for both genders and most orientations. The nakedness is of a more artistic than erotic quality, however. It's also interesting to see a young Hugh Grant play the exact same sort of character he's played his entire career, but with an air of more confidence and maturity. It makes you realize that the stock Hugh Grant character has somewhat aged in reverse, becoming more insecure and befuddled as Grant himself got older.The other actors all do a fine job and it's surprising that Elle Macpherson didn't get more roles after this film. In addition to being stunning, she has a real on screen presence and charisma. You always notice her when she's in a scene, and not just because she's beautiful and without clothes.Sirens has a sense of style and is not at all heavy-handed with its theme of sexual liberation. It's more diverting than engrossing, but if you like period pieces about unusual people and their odd lives (with oodles of bare flesh thrown in), you should give this film a try.

With sly humour, good use of the outback Australia setting, amusing chemistry between Hugh Grant's character and his wife and an interesting argument over some paintings forming very early on; the opening ten or so minutes is rather good. Unfortunately it cannot hold its good premise once everyone settles down at the predominant location of the rich artist's house.The actual plot for this film is very weak when thought about. It's more of an argument/discussion more than anything; in fact I've probably had better discussions in pubs over a drink. Maybe there was something else in there, but it went totally over MY head. Nothing seems to go anywhere, in fact everyone seems to just, literally, settle down at this rich man's house and wait around a few days for the ultimate 'no, I'm not changing my artwork.' 'What's actually going on?', 'Where are the narrative's battles going to come from?' I was asking my self. The film also seems to take a rather shameful turn as its attempt at humour in these early stages comes from the fact small children are swearing.You also have to take into account the actual point of some of the scenes. Again, maybe I missed something altogether deeper, but what was the point of the running game scene where several characters are running and chasing each other through a shallow stream? And what was the point of the fake fairies hanging from ropes outside in the garden, for the children? When looking at the running time for the film, it's not even into triple figures and taking out these scenes would have made it even shorter. This is why I'm suspicious over the actual point of these scenes &#150; I think they're just there to bulk the film up and although it may all seem very sympathetic, it didn't do anything for me.Some things I did like about the film includes the cinematography. As I mentioned, it's shot well and the use of wide shots, exploiting the outback works well. You really get a feel for the place, be you looking at desert or natural springs. The reoccurring snake in-joke was especially amusing as we see numerous examples of Australian wildlife, also. Once again, excellent iconography and good cinematography.One thing that this film has going for it in a big way is the constant 'threat' of the three models. They're central to the 'plot', and if you were to take them out of the film, there wouldn't be one. All the interesting scenes in the film involve them in some way or another and this is odd, because they are overriding Hugh Grant's character along with his wife whom are supposed to be the focus. They are there to argue and discuss but we are not interested &#150; we want to know about the models. Their constant, flirtatious presence is almost comic relief to the audience and their nude scenes are timed well in-between everything else that happens.Although with some good in it, essentially getting the basic principals correct; Sirens fails to deliver when it comes to the plot and any REAL character development. It's just not an interesting film.

Basically young Anglican priest reverend Anthony Campion (Hugh Grant) has been asked by the bishop to travel from England to Australia with his wife Estella (Brassed Off's Tara Fitzgerald) to visit the eccentric artist Norman Lindsay (Sam Neill). The reason for the visit is to try and stop his work getting out, he is prone to painting sexually controversial imagery, but specifically the work Crucified Venus is requested to be withdrawn from show. Anthony tries to stay composed about the opinions of the church, but staying in the artist's place he is shocked by it having no moral standards, especially when it comes to models like Sheela (Elle Macpherson) and Pru (Kate Fischer), and Lindsay's wife Rose (Pamela Rabe) not showing shame or embarrassment taking their clothes off to pose or have fun. But his wife Estella is having trouble also, she is sexually frustrated and has many urges she lusts to fulfil, trying to remain loyal to her husband she cannot help but be intrigued by the women who are free to be nude. By the end of the film Anthony realises that he can do nothing about the desire for Norman to release his latest work, especially as Estella is happy to be depicted in it, and she may have found some passion for her husband after all. Also starring Portia De Rossi as Giddy, Ben Mendelsohn as Lewis, John Polson as Tom and Mark Gerber as Devlin. Grant is indeed wooden and hardly contributes anything but smiling and being posh, Neill doesn't get much time on screen either, Fitzgerald is relatively good as the quietly lusting wife wanting to break free, and Macpherson is okay being naughty and getting her top off a lot. The story is pretty pointless, it seems like just an excuse to see women get their clothes off as often as possible, and if it is meant to make an audience laugh it doesn't do it very well, a silly and pretty boring erotic comedy.

But perhaps the reason the movie is not taken seriously is because it simply isn't any good. The movie drags and drags and then drags some more. The plot never seems to get going. It's a movie that has no energy to it, it just painfully slogs along in hopelessly dull fashion. The film is utterly predictable, you know where this is going right from the beginning but it sure does take its sweet time in getting to that inevitable conclusion. The movie sets itself up as a statement on organized religion's view on sex. But any kind of statement the filmmakers hoped to make is lost because the movie is simply too boring to hold anyones attention long enough to get their point across. The whole enterprise is not helped by some rather clumsy acting, most notably from Macpherson who certainly looks nice but struggles to deliver dialogue in a believable fashion. Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald are reasonably decent in their roles but it's not enough to save this enterprise.

Grant is not sure what to think of the place while Fitzgerald is quietly entranced. Her lingering adulterous thoughts and lesbian tendencies come to the surface during her stay.

Really for all the would-be erotic situations and so-called deep thoughts the movie raises, Sirens is really quite shallow. Fitzgerald is really the primary focus and she is probably the weakest performer of the bunch.

John Duigan wrote and directed this characteristic Australian effort in which every English character is pompous and inadequate and every aussie is a lovable roughian.In the 1920's, a newly-arrived English parson is sent into the outback by the Bishop of Sydney to meet and reason with Norman Lindsay (Sam Neill), an Australian primitive painter whose nude studies are causing the Sydney sacerdotals to get a little hot under their clerical collars.  'Tony', the trendy Oxford vicar (played by Grant, of course), brings his wife Estella on the trip.  Deeply affected by the landscape and the people of the outback, Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) has her deepest sexual longings awakened and is emotionally transformed by her (forgive the expression) foray into the bush.The Australian landscape is dangerous and exciting, and so are the young women who model for Lindsay.  The three girls are, in a sense, emanations of the terrain, simultaneously wild and innocent, passionate and at ease with themselves.  Sheela, Pru and Giddy are the 'sirens' who lure Estella out of her staid English mindset.The train which brings Tony and Estella to this remote spot represents Civilisation, cutting powerfully and purposefully across the plain, and cleaving the gorge.  But the train, like industrial society, is arbitrarily limited in what it can do.  It has to keep within its trammels.There are some knowing references to Victorian painting.  Estella floats on the pool's surface in her diaphanous nightie, a nodding reference to Millais' Ophelia.  Sheela, Pru and Giddy gather nymph-like among the water lilies as Devlin kneels Narcissus-like, 'quoting' Alma Tadema, Leighton and those other academicians who doubled as purveyors of parlour pornography.Duigan's screenplay is racked with anachronisms.  The locals in the bar, especially the young hunks, are patently 1990's actors approximating a 1920's look.  No-one of that era, in criticising a work of art as Tony does, would talk of negative images building up.  When Giddy tells Sheela You're so cheap, that is a modern Australian teenager talking, not a girl of the 1920's.  Why cocaine has to be mentioned is utterly mystifying, save that the showbiz luvvies associated with the film no doubt got a thrill from hearing it.  Expressions such as 'banging on', 'what's your point?' and 'totally compromising' have no place in a 20's setting.  Either Duigan was careless with his script or, worse, assumed that his audience would know no better.A heavy-handed Titanic metaphor runs throught the film, for no very good reason.  We see Estella in monochrome at the very beginning, on the deck of a four-stack ocean liner, presumably en route to Australia.  A toy Titanic floats in the fountain basin in the Lindsay yard.  If that isn't laborious enough, the camera closes in on a labelled photo of the Titanic in the railway carriage.  It is all to do with the sirens luring folk to destruction, you see?This Australian Eden would be incomplete without a snake, and so we get one.  It is no doubt also meant to represent the penis.  Sheela adds to this particular symbolism with her unbelievably lame 'sword and dagger' joke. Dipping into the stilton cheese is yet another underwhelming sexual metaphor.Never mind the hollow feminist slogans put into the mouths of the five actresses who have their bodies exploited.  The makers of this film have cranked out a shallow, unintelligent skin flick which underneath the bogus carapace of 'symbolism' has nothing to say for itself.
