The focus shifts from one character to another, but the story is pretty much always told from the viewpoint of the girls.This movie is bittersweet to me because it documents much of the tragedy surrounding the senseless killings on the street but it also offers a vision of hope.  The characters in the film are shown as real human beings - the director used a mix of actors and real people from the neighborhood.  It's sad to see how innocent many of them are yet how easily the violence comes.Don't think this is just all shootings and beatings.  It's mostly about the neighborhood and the people in it, and that's where the sweet in bittersweet comes from.  Even amid all the tragedy, men and women hook up with each other, babies are born, life goes on.  It's not the melodrama of West Side Story, it's more a poignant look at life in the Echo.Production values lag at times but this is still a very fine movie and one of my favorites.

The film is never over-dramatized.  The dialogue is authentic, and never stylized, and so are the performances.  The story never takes the predictable Hollywood route.  However, it still could've used more structure.  At first I thought the film's focus was on the character of Sad Girl.  About 15-20 minutes through, the focus changes to another character and the same pattern occurs throughout the film.  So I didn't feel as connected to the film as I expected.  If the characters and situations were unrealistic, I would be totally disengaged, but that wasn't the case and as a result, I was still entertained and moved.  Almost all the scenes take place in apartments, sidewalks and parks, so it's obvious that the film was made on a low-budget, but that small budget was put to good use and I give Allison Anders much credit.  My score  7 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"A look at another world","Date":"7 December 2000","Score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":"  This movie feels more like a documentary than anything else. You sense the realism in the script, locations and the actors. It helps that you will not recognize anyone here from anywhere else, there is no baggage at all with the actors. The movie follows the lives of several women who live on the periphery of a hispanic gang. They live lifes of tragedy and sadness, loathing themselves and the town they are from. They push their children in strollers, watch out for drive-by shootings and wait for the latest news on which of their boyfriends were killed, injured or jailed. The movie also portrays quite well, in the face of their tragedy, the girls have a strong bond within themselves and even though they may have fights over men, they ultimately will stand up for each other. They should, it seems no one else will. Great movie. Recommended as an escape movie. It will take you out of your world to a world you would probably never want to visit. Like life, it is not romanticized and it is not shown in an overly bad light. It just is.

It shows that no matter how you begin your life you always have a choice and depending on the choice you make it can change your life forever. From gangs to drugs and even guns this movie takes you in the life of some harsh realities. With the good the bad and the babies they do the best they can with what they have. Survival is everything.

It was pretty disappointing, but not a complete waste of time. I'm not an expert on gangs, but I believe the other reviewer may be correct that this film is relatively realistic, and at the same time, it is not excessively graphic for a gang movie, focusing on various lives in the neighborhood.The worst part was definitely the acting. Some of the writing was painful too, but there were a few outstanding scenes. My favorite bit was a monologue (I think by Ernesto?) about the different feelings he gets (disgust, superiority, sexual arousal) from selling drugs to desperate whites. Certain characters like Blue Eyes and Puppet were also interesting, but otherwise the story was pretty weak. There was an interesting attempt at carrying a feminist message but it didn't really work for me. If anyone knows of a better film about Chicano gangs, let me know.

Very impressive. Watch out for cameos by a young Spike Jonze and Jason Lee. That's a footnote though, the film is enjoyable, the medium pace never stretches your patience and the performances are very good.Themes of retribution, faith, friendship and loyalty are the main talking points, but I'd recommend this film to anyone with a slight interest in gang culture and in this case, female gangs.

Mi Vida Loca is the best glimpse a lay person will ever get into the pre-gentrification Echo Park. This is Los Angeles, shortly after the Rodney King riots. Mousie (Seidy Lopez, Resurrection Blvd) and Sad Girl (Angel Aviles, Desperado), two lifelong friends, and members of the Echo Parque Locas gang, each have a kid by the same guy, drug dealer and Echo Parque gang member Ernesto (Jacob Vargas, Selena, Road Dogz).A death in their tight knit circle changes everything, including many preexisting grudges. But a real wild card gets thrown into their hand when a homegirl, Giggles (Marlo Marron, My Funny Valentine), is released from prison, and tries to steer the homegirls away from the street life, and into a life in COMPUUUUTERS!!!. Her very astute warning of what the future will be like, likely learned while reading in prison, falls on deaf ears, but her independent, entrepreneurial spirit does not, as she leads the homegirls through a plan to get the best out of a pickup truck in which the ownership thereof is in dispute, not only within the Echo Park gang, but also with a member of the rival River Valley gang, El Duran (Jesse Borrego, Bound By Honor Blood In Blood Out). A correspondence between a beautiful yet reclusive younger sister of Sad Girl, La Blue Eyes (Magali Alvarado), who's trip is getting an education and avoiding the gang life, and a torcedo (guest of the California prison system), eventually puts La Blue Eyes front and center of the tragic climax of these intertwining stories.

Based on the summary outline, I thought I would see somewhat of a gangsta story with some plot and redeeming features. Unfortunately all this movie provided me was a very slow moving story of various machismo gangsta's being shot off one by one and then the scene would shift and we would be left watching another one of the gangsta's funerals. There was a memorium at the end of the movie so I assume the story may be (loosely) based on a real life person(s) but the story telling that was narrated by one of the primary characters was very boring and the acting below par. Look for bit parts from actors Salma Hayek and Danny Trejo before they were well known stars with a list of movie credits behind them. As for the main stars in this film, just like some of the gangsta's in this movie who were killed off, I guess their portrayal of a mob girl was just a bit too (un)real and so their movie careers died. Go figure.

But I live in LA and not too far from where Echo Park is. My first exposure to the gangs was through Los Angeles Times; but later when I started tutoring a kid, I started learning lots of things about the gang culture. (No, the kid does not belong to any gang. To make sure that he won't, his parents enrolled him in Taek Won Do, Tennis and many other such things). For example, earlier I never knew that seemingly innocent graffiti on the walls signify gang territory, or that a bandanna of a certain color, or even a pair of Nike shoes of a certain make implies on'es affiliation to a particular gang. Similarly, a shoe hanging from a telephone wire conveys a message...and that as a kid, this kid was offered gang membership in his school from some of his classmates.I watched Mi Vida Loca with interest because of such background information I have. And to me, as an outsider, the movie seems to depict reality. Now, though my opinion in this matter perhaps does not make much difference, testimonials/reviews from people, who were themselves involved with gangs earlier, make me feel that this movie does indeed depict reality of the mean streets.It's obvious that some of he actors are not professionals, but who cares! In addition to the main actors, Bertila Damas (Rachel)'s face is so dignified, and she carries herself with so much grace that one almost forgets that she's depicting an ex gang-banger.Similarly, Nelida Lopez (Whisper) looks really so fresh and innocent that she instantly wins hearts.In my opinion, irrespective of what critics say about the movie,the kind of emotions this movie seems to have generated from the ex gang-members (read their reviews here) proves that this movie has succeeded in doing what it perhaps intended to do to open people's eyes towards the harsh reality of gang life. And I think, that alone proves the worth of this movie.

Therefore I am going to have to give this movie two thumbs down. The movie does nothing but show the negative aspects of ghetto life and places Hispanic faces to portray it.Main characters Mousie and Sad Girl never change throughout the movie. In fact almost all the characters are pretty one-dimensional and have no revelation or turn-around whatsoever. The only character to change was Giggles when she decides to get a job with computers but the other girls look at her as if they don't know the meaning of the word. They think she's weird for wanting to better herself so instead they sit around at home, don't go to school, deal drugs and bring their children around the other gang members. There's even an irrelevant part where Sad Girl is tripping out because she only has two food stamps left.
