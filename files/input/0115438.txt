[{"Title":"THIS is a romantic comedy?","Date":"20 August 2004","Score":"42 out of 58 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" (Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.)Yes. You've seen grunge on the run romantic comedies--Wild at Heart (1990), Natural Born Killers (1994) come to mind, and poor waitress/crazy old man romantic comedies, e.g., As Good As It Gets (1997)--well, this is a mousy secretary/aging hit man romantic comedy.Somewhat. It's also a tongue-in-the cheek satire on all things that Hollywood thinks movie-goers crave cute dogs, sexy women, good-hearted underdogs winning out, dumb cops, the ugly rich (Greg Cruttwell's wormy Allan Hopper fits the bill), shoot-outs, blood, dead bodies (enough to grace a Shakespearean stage) and that favorite of testosterone males everywhere a good old-fashioned cat fight.Charlize Theron and Teri Hatcher provide the eye appeal as they slap and toss each other around; and to be honest I have to say they are definitely worth watching. Excellent support comes from James Spader, as an amazingly clean-shaven (what does he use--Nair?) psycho-sickie with a stopwatch.But Danny Aiello is the real star. He plays Dosmo Pizzo, the over-the-hill hit man (currently moonlighting in embarrassment at the local pizzeria). He loses his hairpiece, finds redemption, true love, thirty thousand Big Ones, and presumably lives happily ever after on the lam with his unlikely moll (Glenne Headly) in this clever plot by coincidence from director and scriptwriter John Herzfeld.(By the way, what's with Hollywood and its perverse love affair with sympathetic hit men? A new genre? The hit man as the underclass hero? I just saw Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) which stars John Cusack as a cute amoral murder artist. What next? The lovable terrorist? Knowing Hollywood, I think we can count on it.)Anyway, Spader's character is not so lovable. He kills without the slightest qualm and takes a great delight in blowing people away. Charlize is his girl friend and they have lots of you-know-what together. Teri Hatcher is an Olympic class skier with a loser boyfriend. And the Valley of course is the San Fernando Valley just north of L.A., onetime home of the Valley girls, now best known as the porn capital of America.Jeff Daniels and Eric Stoltz play Valley cops (who are not as smart as L.A. cops--one of the jokes in the movie, ha, ha, ha). Both do a great job. Daniels is street wise and quick on the trigger and a bit of a prude while Stoltz is naive and a wanna-be homicide inspector. There are half a dozen cameos by not so well-known but talented people like veteran Austin Pendleton who does a killer sarcastic monologue on the directorial failures of suicidal Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky). One-time Goodbye Girl Marsha Mason has a modest part as a sweet and realistic nurse, and she is excellent. And there are dogs. You gotta have dogs. However what makes this work is some clever dialogue and some satirical plot ideas, but mainly it is a tour de force of acting by a talented and highly professional cast. This is one of those movies in which every actor is a threat to steal the show at any time one way or the other. In a way it's a parade of cameos cleverly stitched together and then nicely edited.But see this for James Spader whose skill playing nerdish weirdos is on fine display.

I saw it in theaters and enjoyed it very much, and now that I bought the DVD I still enjoy it very much!  This is really a unique, original piece of work with echoes of Tarantino.  Just like any Tarantino film, the characterizations are very well-developed and the dialogue is sharp, witty and full of observation.  The film is an ensemble piece that works on the same level as many others in the genre  We're approached with a series of characters and as the story develops, we watch how the situations all interweave.  The result is a hilarious, drop-dead funny dark comedy that's entertaining from start to finish!  The music by Anthony Marinelli perfectly accentuates the ironic, darkly comic setting.  One of the crucial elements to make a film like this work is, of course, the characters.  Each character is quirky in their own respect, yet they're not caricatures.  This is not a farce; this is a real comedy about real people who are really screwed up.  We probably know some of these people in our personal lives.  And the wonderful cast of multi-talented performers shine in each of their respective roles.  Danny Aiello is definitely one of our best actors, with an intense screen presence.  He blesses us with another memorable performance as a hitman-turned-pizzeria-owner, who takes a yuppie couple (Glenne Headley, Greg Crutwell) hostage.  Headley is a mousey, ultimately naive woman who does everything for, yet ceases to please, her mate--Crutwell as an annoyingly snooty Englishman with kidney problems.  You want to cheer in every scene Aiello yells in his face or punches him out.  Former teen star Eric Stoltz is good in a quiet role as a rookie detective, who's a little held-back but knows what's right.  Jeff Daniels is beautifully cast and outstanding as his partner, who's been in the business for a lot longer, but is a loose cannon and will do absolutely anything--including exposing the masseuses of a Japanese parlor for alleged prostitution--to protect the dear Valley.  James Spader has mastered the role of the yuppie serial killer, and reprises the role he was born to play.  He's smooth as ever and sadistic as ever.  That's the Spader we know!  Charlize Theron is the sexiest in her debut role as Spader's seductive partner.  If you want to see the beautiful Charlize at her absolute hottest--look no further!  Paul Mazursky--who I've seen in other movies, but doesn't quite stick in my mind--has a nice little supporting role as a washed-up screenwriter.  I'll probably have him better stored in my memory after seeing him in this movie, he really is terrific.  Finally, we have veteran actress Marsha Mason as a nurse, whose half brother is Crutwell.  And there we go--the characters interweave.  Each character has an odd sense of irony, which is what's wonderful about this movie.The only minor flaws are the sometimes-contrived ways of merging the characters into different situations and the excess of characters.  There are tons of characters, and though they are all greatly developed in their own particular scenes, the running time prohibits us from getting to know the whole story on some of them--and that's a little bit of crutch, since we grow to love (or love to hate) all these characters.  For example, I wanted to see more of Daniels' character and his story comes to a halt midway. Nevertheless, I was laughing all the way through and never once felt that the film lagged.  I was surprised to look at John Herzfeld's (the writer/director) filmography and see a group of TV movies, after-school specials and a few flops, including Two of a Kind with John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.  Herzfeld really has an ear for dialogue, and he can be the next Tarantino!  I'm not kidding!  And I love the way he captures the sunny California setting.  So beautiful and picturesque.  I know I'm using a lot of superlatives to describe this movie, but it's so darn good and so few people went to see it and I hope more people do.  So I urge anyone who hasn't to check out this underrated gem!  You won't be disappointed! My score  8 (out of 10)         "},{"Title":"Too much fun to miss","Date":"8 October 2005","Score":"29 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" In addition to the clever plot and delicious acting you get to see very early work by Charlize Theron and James Spader, either of which is worth your time.

It has a slew of twists and veers from one set of characters to another at the drop of a hat.  Unlike Pulp, however, there are many sympathetic characters mixed into the cast.  The film has humor (a hired gunman that spends much of the movie looking for Italian seasonings while cooking for his captives), some sadness (a once successful director down on his luck,  ready for suicide, being ridiculed by a bit part actor), a very lush Charlize Theron, a movie mogul with kidney stones, and an extremely competent killer that has a thing with his stop watch.  Let's not forget the two police officers, one a compassionate young man looking to advance to criminal investigation, the other a red neck failure that decides its time to shoot a foursome at the golf course next to his home.  How these characters are brought together through the planning of an Olympic star (well, almost a star)who is ready to have her ex knocked off for the will is amusing, well acted, and one of the best films I've seen in some time.

Aping both Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects, Herzfeld gets in some good, quick lines that raise a laugh or two, but the overall feel of the film seems like cinematic backtracking (it is knowingly recycled). Stand-out performances come from Danny Aiello as a contract killer, Charlize Theron as a femme fatale, and filmmaker Paul Mazursky in a rare acting turn playing a suicidal movie director. Herzfeld's screenplay is florid and sordid, and it's all rather fun on a minor, non-think level, yet his direction is far superior in its smaller moments than in the grand flourishes. Any time there are more than two people on the screen, question marks tend to visibly arise--and then it's every actor for himself. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Dark, Deadly and Delicious","Date":"14 April 2001","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  This is great !

I am sure you get the picture. Neat enough set of stories, and some clever dialogue (sometimes lost in the murk of a badly recorded soundtrack), but the best thing is that this is a really good portmanteau film. You get Danny Aiello as the framed sidekick to James Spader's truly odious murderer (he nearly shoots his badly wounded femme fatal girlfriend 'for your own good' more than a hint of Reservoir Dogs methinks), Teri Hatcher as the sport obsessed wife hiring the killers, Eric Stoltz as the wistful vice cop, Jeff Daniels as his partner, Louise Fletcher, Keith Carradine&#133;.and a whole slew of other faces you can recognise but not quite place.

Lee Woods (James Spader) is a cold-blooded hit man and Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello) a soft-at-heart gangster; they've been sent to murder Roy Foxx (Peter Horton), the former husband of also-ran Olympic skier Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher).  	Alvin (Jeff Daniels) and Wes (Eric Stoltz) are two cops on vice detail. Alvin dreams of becoming a homicide detective, so when he discovers that he might be on the trail of a murder, it's like Santa Claus showed up in mid-July to hand him a present.  	In an attempt to try and pin Foxx's murder on Dosmo, Lee tries to do away with him.  Dosmo manages to escape, forcing him to hide out in the home of Hopper, a pretentious English art dealer (Greg Cruttwell), whom Dosmo holds hostage along with Hopper's long-suffering assistant, Susan (Glenne Headly). In the midst of all this, a down-on-his-luck television director (Paul Mazursky) contemplates suicide (the main stumbling block is finding someone to take care of his dog), and meets a compassionate nurse (Marsha Mason) on a visit to a cemetery, whom he convinces to take the dog. 	The feature film directorial debut of long-time TV movie creator Herzfeld, this crime thriller interweaves several related plot lines into one tongue-in-cheek noir tapestry. The film is occasionally fun, and genre fans will appreciate its hip, self-mocking energy.  	There are some good performances too, notably from James Spader, returning to his roots as a slick, ice-cold heavy, newcomer Charlize Theron in a hilarious over-the-top sexpot role, and Paul Mazursky, who usually comes off as too precious, in the nicely modulated part of a suicidal pet lover.

However, she doesn't realize they plan to kill him IN HER BED! Afterward James Spader's character tries to kill partner Danny Aiello's character, bombing his car, but he escapes and rolls down the hill to the doctor's house.There is the relationship between the two cops, Eric Stoltz and Jeff Daniels, Daniels just wants to catch and arrest the whores at the message parlor because it is going to ruin his community, while Stoltz wants to be a better detective. There is the down and out writer/director who is planning suicide, tries to give his dog away, then meets the nurse, finds a new lease on life, and ends up shooting the hit man crook in the final scene.Aiello and Glenne Headley's characters share an Italian bond and they end up hooking up. Charlize Theron, before she became famous, played the Swede who was shot by Hatcher, and she dies in the street from blood loss, right after Spader's gun jams when he was attempting a mercy killing of her instead of risk taking her to a hospital.  Notable was an earlier scene between Spader and the mostly nude Theron in his bedroom.During the 48 hours of the story, it turns out that all the characters cross paths, some for the better and some for the worse. The three people who are shot and killed are all bad people - a cheating ex-husband, a hit man, and the hit man's girl.  Still, to have that kind of violence in what is supposed to be a comedy is wrong. It just goes to trivialize killings, further desensitizing the audience to what really is about the worst thing we can do to our fellow humans.

The main problem is that writer and director John Herzfeld's career has been mainly concentrated on the small screen---and it shows. But that's not a total negative because he does have a gift for moving along a story. In 2 Days... he certainly keeps the action and dialog flowing at a crisp rate. Unfortunately, the film tries to be both a tongue-in-cheek action film and a Black Comedy and wavers uncomfortably between the two genres.The plot revolves around a murder-for-hire to collect some life insurance money with James Spader playing the hit-man and Charlize Theron as his sexy accomplice. A naive (but beautiful) Teri Hatcher unwittingly aids and abets their plan and ends up the worst for it. Jeff Daniels steals the show as a disgruntled LA cop on the edge of losing his sanity while putting his young partner (Eric Stoltz) through the ringer. Glenne Headley and Marsha Mason, two fine and distinguished actresses, seem a bit lost in this film and neither of them have enough screen time to make a real impression. Danny Aiello and Paul Mazursky are also in the cast and both of them have worked with far better and more cohesive scripts. Louise Fletcher and Keith Carradine have all too brief cameo appearances and neither of them make much of a dent in the proceedings. Carradine is killed off so fast that he might not have collected a paycheck for his efforts. 2 Days in the Valley will remind viewers a little bit of another film that tried to be too much; the 1985 John Landis film Into the Night. Similar to that movie, 2 Days... strays too far from a coherent story line and drifts off into too many directions at once. It won't ruin your evening, but it won't make it any better either.

Each character in the ensemble has his or her own story and it is fascinating to see all the stories come together. James Spader plays his typical snarky bad guy. Jeff Daniels plays a slightly unhinged cop protecting his beloved Valley. Eric Stoltz is quite good as Daniels' partner. Charlize Theron and Teri Hatcher are around to look pretty although there may be more than meets the eye there. Stealing the show is Danny Aiello as a washed-up mobster with a bad hairpiece and a serious affinity for pasta who believe it or not is really the good guy of the picture. Yes, it's a mobster with heart. And with all those big names there is still plenty of room for some perhaps lesser-known but still rather talented performers led by Greg Crutwell in a part which could easily have come off as caricature had he not played it so well. It would be impossible to call any of these actors the lead. It's a true ensemble with about 10 or 11 co-leads. And somehow all these seemingly disparate characters see their fates intertwined over two days in the valley. Even more amazingly each of these characters' stories is in and of itself an interesting one. Throw them all together and you've got a movie that works really well.Now this might all sound a little convoluted and at times it is. The circumstances which bring all these characters together do at times seem a little far-fetched. But you'll find yourselves emotionally invested in all these characters. Many movies have a hard time getting you interested in one character let alone a dozen or so. A number of great character studies here. There are moments of humor, sadness and outright mania sprinkled in along the way. All in all a very solid effort.

Story takes place in The Valley in Los Angeles where an assortment of characters become intertwined with each other caused by two hit men.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Lee Woods (James Spader) and Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello) are the two hit men and they kill the boyfriend of a famous skier named Becky (Teri Hatcher) who as it turns out is involved in the whole thing. Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazurski) is a down and out movie director who is contemplating suicide but he meets a nurse named Audrey (Marsha Mason) who takes him to her brothers house. Two cops (Eric Stoltz & Jeff Daniels) come upon the murder scene and they start to think that Becky might know more than she's letting on. Lee takes Becky to his motel room to stay with his Norwegian girlfriend Helga (Charlize Theron) and then heads out to find the money that is the cause of all of this. Dosmo was thought to be killed by Lee but he survives and hides out in a home until he can think of what to do but he encounters Teddy and Audrey and her brother and he also meets Susan Parish (Glenne Headly) whom he starts to flirt with.This is written and directed by John Herzfeld who after making Two of a Kind worked primarily in television until getting motivated to make this film. This film does play like it was spawned from the same loins of Pulp Fiction but it's hard to bash a film like this mainly because the cast is top notch. Spader has always been a good actor and he's especially good at playing A-holes and here he plays a hit-man who pulls out a stopwatch and gives his victims 60 seconds to talk or else. You also have to give a lot of credit to Aiello who not only plays a gunman but one that actually can draw sympathy from an audience and Herzfeld's script allows for Aiello to have a memorable performance. Not only does the script glow from Tarantino's influence but it also reminded me of many of Robert Altman's work who mastered quirky events in the Los Angeles area. Aside from the luscious shots of a nude Theron this film lacks any real edge to be considered anything but an enjoyable time killer but it is genuinely fun to watch and boasts some good performances that make this well worth seeking out.

It sort of plays like what would happen if Robert Altman were given a Quentin Tarantino script, told to make his characters stick to the dialogue faithfully, and bring the whole thing under a PG-13 rating. The characters are cartoons, occasionally very stylish cartoons, and there's some oddly touching relationships. But they're almost in the way of the caper that's not really a caper, the slick criminals who turn out to be dumb as doornails, a truly odd love quadrangle, and various bits of schtick that ultimately don't hang together very well.I'm sure from the above it sounds like I really don't think this is a good movie, and I don't, except I still enjoy watching it when it comes up. To be true to the Lester Bangs Turntable Test, this really does make it a 'good' movie. I've seen a lot 'better' movies that were harder to watch the second through fifth times, that's for sure.James Spader is a particular delight in this flick; it's a pity his character is sort of cropped, cut out, and pasted back into this movie as if you're missing most of the picture. Paul Mazursky also makes a nice turn as an out-of-work director -- I've never seen him bad in anything, it makes one almost wish he'd do more character acting than directing.In any event, don't try to make sense of the plot loopholes, the lack of motivation for the characters to make the legions of idiotic mistakes, the deus ex machina liberally employed to keep the action rolling, and pretend it's not trying to be darker and slicker than it really is, and there's an enjoyable piece of brain candy waiting for you at the bottom of the jar.

It seemed to me to be a BLATANT rip-off of Pulp Fiction, only much more poorly executed.  I remember that there was a particularly painful dialogue scene given to Paul Mazursky.  It was of the style of Quentin Tarantino's observational dialogue that is so captivating when done well. Here it was quite embarrassing to watch, I actually hid my face behind a pillow. By the way, this is no slight against Mr. Mazursky who is fabulous in `Miami Rhapsody', you can do only so much with what you are given.I savaged the film in reviews at that time, but in retrospect I think that it may have been a protective reaction for Pulp Fiction which I felt was being maligned by comparison.  Since then of course Pulp Fiction has become an established icon whereas this film has faded into obscurity.I caught a piece of the film on cable a few weeks ago and I believe I may have been too harsh in my initial judgment.  No, it is not a good film, and yes some of the dialogue is painful (the whole one-minute thing is torturous), but there are some cute moments in the film.The film's major failing is the unnecessarily violence.  This film is really a light comedy at its heart, not a black comedy, and certainly not in the unique category of Pulp Fiction.  It would have been better to keep the tone lighter.  The most successful scenes are Danny Aiello's performances in the house.  I think in this respect the creative staff of Two Days In the Valley missed the point when trying to emulate Pulp Fiction.  It was not the violence that made that film great- it was witty dialogue, meaty characters, and great ensemble chemistry.I probably wouldn't watch it from beginning to end again but it's amusing to sample.

But the idea of the ensemble dramatic action film to begin with was brought fourth by Pulp Fiction in 1994 and that's exactly what this film is -- An ensemble film with many, many intertwining sub-plots and characters.  If anyone can tell me with a straight face that any movies like this would be made today if it was not for Pulp Fiction, than they are giving the makers of this film and others like it a whole lot of undeserved credit.That's not to say 2 Days in the Valley is a pale rip-off and a bad film. It is pretty entertaining throughout the course of the film and has some interesting storylines.  But unlike Tarantino, the writers and director of this film do not give these characters any depth.  Sure, there are a few surprises here and there and revelations about characters that are unexpected, but you don't see anything more.  The only characters in this film that seem to be developed at all beyond their minor shells and can hold the interest of the viewer are that of the washed up film director (played very well by Paul Mazursky) and the hardened by-the-book cop (Jeff Daniels, in one of his better roles in recent years).  Besides that, it's a cast of predictable bad guys, bumbling small-time criminals and forgettable characters.To sum it up, 2 Days in the Valley is a decent rainy day rental, but nothing to write home about.  If you want to see much better Tarantino inspired work of recent years, I suggest Doug Liman's great and highly underrated Go and most recently, Christopher McQuarrie's very stylish and entertaining The Way of the Gun.

Third, the location, personalities, dialogue, and plot of the movie are completely different than PF.  Just because a movie has criminals portrayed in it, does not mean that it is ripping of PF.  I mean, not every director goes into the studio thinking  I want to be Quentin Tarantino; he is a god.Now, why do I like this movie?  Well, the acting is first-rate in this tongue-in-cheek film where nothing is what it seems.  For example, in the beginning of the movie, we see Danny Aiello and James Spader listening into the conversation of a couple in their house.  We don't know why or what they are going to do.  Next, Lee (Spader) kills the man in the house, and then tries to kill Dosmo (Aiello), and we still don't know what is going on. Although Spader has a conversation with the man he kills in the house (which we might believe is giving us a clue to the plot), yet, later, we discover the clue is a false one.  The plot is so full of characters lying, and of the irony of events that play out, that, coupled with the unpredictability of events in the first half, and of the predictability of the ending, a viewer would be remiss to not check out this film to watch at least once. It is not Pulp Fiction.  In fact, if you want to compare it to another entertainment medium, look at it like Seinfeld in California.  The characters are shallow, the story is contrived, the irony is replete, and the Byzantine script connects all characters in the end.

After making their escape, Lee shoots Dosmo and leaves him in a burning car so that the money they're due to be paid won't have to be split two ways.Unknown to Lee, Dosmo (who was wearing a bulletproof vest) survives and takes shelter at the nearby home of wealthy art dealer Allan Hopper (Greg Cruttwell) whose Kidney stones are causing him great pain. Initially, Dosmo holds Hopper and his assistant Susan Parish (Glenne Headly) at gunpoint and later, when Hopper's sister Audrey (Marsha Mason) arrives with a guy called Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky), they're also taken hostage.When Becky regains consciousness, she's covered in blood and horrified to find her estranged husband's dead body.

The two men in the car turn out to be vice cops who get drawn into the subsequent murder investigation, as well as two other homicide detectives who are officially assigned to the case. Lee returns to the scene of the crime to collect his money and this puts the lives of all the police officers in extreme danger. Not too surprisingly, the movie comes to its very violent conclusion when most of the surviving characters eventually meet up.The circumstances that Dosmo and Teddy found themselves in were similar as they were both older men who were seriously down-on-their-luck. Dosmo was a washed-up hit man who was only hired by Lee because he wanted to set him up as a fall-guy and Teddy, after many years as a TV director had seen his career degenerate to such a low point that he'd become suicidal. Against all the odds, in this story, both men found the promise of something better for their futures when they met Susan and Audrey. Aiello and Mazursky both do a great job in conveying their characters' humanity and despair.James Spader provides the movie's standout performance as the sadistic Lee who even uses a stopwatch as an instrument to inflict further pain and anguish on his helpless victims and Charlize Theron makes a strong impression as his equally evil girlfriend, Helga. Eric Stolz and Jeff Daniels add considerable colour to the proceedings as the two vice cops with very different attitudes to their jobs and Teri Hatcher is convincing as the treacherous Becky.2 Days In The Valley was given mixed reviews when it was first released as many reviewers understandably compared it unfavourably with Pulp Fiction which had been released just two years earlier. However, in view of the number of years that have elapsed since the release of Tarantino's masterpiece, maybe it's now more pertinent to judge this movie on its own merits and recognise its positive values a bit more clearly.

In my opinion, this film is a crime classic, and I cannot believe 2 Days In The Valley (TDINV) is not better known. If you look at the cast you will understand why. It starts with Lee Woods (James Spader), a super cool robotic hit man, and his partner Helga Svelgen (Charlize Theron), who is an ice cold evil blonde. They are hired to kill the husband of Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher), so she can be on the US Olympic Team. They are promised $30,000 which is in the house to do so. Assisting them is hit man Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello), who turns against them, when they set him up to be the fall guy. Spoilers ahead Helga, gets killed by Becky after a nasty cat fight (She had it coming to her). Meanwhile, Dosmo ends up meeting Susan (Glenn Headley), who is constantly abused by her snobbish boss Allen Hopper (Greg Cruttwell), and treated worse than his dog. In my favorite scene, Dosmo discovers Susan is Italian (Something in six years, Greg never learned about her because he took no interest in her as a human being), and he cooks a meal (As he is holding them hostage), and has her sit at the table with him, while he eats on the floor with his dog. Other key characters are washed screenwriter Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) who wanted to commit suicide after he found someone to take care of his dog, Nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason), and Detectives Strayer (Jeff Daniels) and Taylor (Eric Stolz).Spoilers In the end, Lee ends up shooting Taylor, and Dosmo tries to rescue him, but cannot defeat Lee, and both will be killed, except Teddy shoots Lee dead. That action, enables him to get his confidence back and be able to start over with Audrey (Marsha Mason). One other point, about Peppers, you see in the final scene with Audrey, that he is very different than before, and will not only get a reward from the City for saving Taylor, but since he is in screenwriter, he can tell a story (leaving Dosmo & Susan out of course), that could get him a huge advance. Think about it A Hollywood writer saves a cop, Warner Bros, Paramount, Universal and all the rest would bid on that. I would figure, that should be worth six figures to him. Dosmo and Susan end up with the $30,000 and will go to New York to open a pizza shop (Taylor lets him have it, because he was willing to take a bullet for him (Essentially the hit man turns good guy because of his conscious)). A key theme of the film is second chances for people who were essentially washed up Dosmo, Susan, Teddy, Taylor (He would have been dead except for Dosmo & Teddy), Becky (Who gets away with it), and last, but not least, Strayer who is abusive cop, who almost shoots a black guy (Due to his temper) and wants to commit suicide, but because of thinking about his daughter does not (He gets a letter telling him to turn in his Badge, for psychological reasons, but although unhappy, at least he tolerates it, and has a chance to get his act cleaned up (Based on the theme of the film, he does). Basically a crime classic 10/10 stars.

For this alone I tip my hat to writer/director John Herzfeld. As most of his previous work was in American television, this was the first piece of Herzfeld's work I ever saw but the guy is so talented and I am always drawn to movies and directors who are not afraid to experiment. Herzfeld makes bold decisions in this movie and is never afraid to delve further behind each character's mask with the writing - thus creating an intruiging, edge-of-the-seat, never boring thriller.  For me, however, the direction stands on an equal footing to the writing. This is clearly Herzfeld's own film and it is always refreshing to see a movie where the director has had some freedom to make his own decisions.He has produced a film that captures, through the various characters, a scary reality that we can all relate to at some point but also a fairy-tale theme that connects all the stories - accentuated by the Hollywood-style finale.The film also plays on the 'movie within a movie' theme - which has so often been done - but I have never known it to be worked into a story as expertly as it has here.This film cleverly balances irony with realism and, yet, never forgets its main purpose - to always keep you interested.  Tarantino doesn't even deserve a mention here (doh!) and if John Herzfeld never does anything else I will still admire him and hold him in higher regard to many other film makers working today.

Really.  Sarcasm continues, brace yourself.First of all, TDV takes the bold, original step of having an almost completely nonlinear storyline.  I was so shocked when I noticed this, because nobody had done such a thing before. I mean, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs jumped around a lot from different groups of people and storylines that occasionally intersected, but TDV had more women.The second thing that I noticed was that two of the main characters of TDV were hitmen, one of whom spent a lot of his screen time trying to put meaning to the crazy mixed-up world he found himself living in.  Again, nothing like Pulp Fiction.  Many people say that Jules in PF did much of the same thing, but I hardly think that the characters were identical...I mean, Jules was black.Another thing that completely set apart TDV from Tarantino's films was that one of the primary characters gets shot in the stomach and then lays in a blood pool and grimaces for the rest of the movie.Eric Stoltz and Laurence Tierney also set TDV apart from Tarantino films.

Films of this sort have become popular in the last few years, Crash, Babel and Syriana all being well-known examples. The introductory storyline involves two hit men, Lee Woods and Dosmo Pizzo, who kill a man named Roy Foxx while he lies in bed with his ex-wife, Becky, a former skiing champion. Woods then betrays Pizzo, shooting him and blowing up their car in order to set him up as the fall guy. Woods's plan misfires, however, and Pizzo survives, albeit injured. Gradually, more and more people become involved in the saga, starting with Woods's glamorous Norwegian girlfriend Helga and Allan Hopper, an art dealer, in whose house Pizzo seeks shelter. Others include Hopper's assistant Susan, his sister Audrey, a nurse, the two police officers to whom Becky reports the killing, and Teddy Peppers, a once-successful film producer now down on his luck and contemplating suicide.Teri Hatcher's performance as Becky earned her a nomination for Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress. Whether that was fair or not is difficult to say, as I have never seen any other of the other nominated performances for that year, but this film did strengthen my general impression that Hatcher is an actress more at home on television than in the cinema. There were, however, a number of better acting contributions, notably from Danny Aiello as Pizzo, surprisingly sympathetic for a man whose occupation is killing people, Greg Cruttwell as the irascible Hopper, James Spader as the ruthless Woods, whose failure to finish off Pizzo shows that ruthless and efficient are not necessarily synonyms, and Jeff Daniels and Eric Stoltz as the two cops, Alvin Strayer and Wes Taylor. The two, who are not homicide detectives but vice cops who just happen to be in the area, have sharply contrasting characters. Alvin, the older of the two, is obsessed with driving all prostitutes out of the area, especially Asian immigrants, of whom he has a particular dislike. The young rookie Wes, by contrast, is more concerned with getting out of the vice squad and into homicide, and although Alvin berates him for his lack of knowledge of elementary police procedures it is Wes who comes up with the vital insight into the crime, namely that Becky might know more than she is telling. Charlize Theron, in her first major screen role, looks absolutely stunning as Helga.Despite its ostensibly serious subject-matter, the film never really feels like a traditional crime thriller. Although it revolves around a murder, it has more of the feel of a black comedy, not so much in the sense that it is played for laughs but rather in the sense that is played tongue in cheek. With its quirky, eccentric characters it betrays the influence of the films of Quentin Tarantino such as Pulp Fiction. Black comedy can be something of an acquired taste, and is a difficult genre to get right, but director John Herzfeld does enough to keep the viewer's interest alive. Two Days in the Valley is not a great film, but it is refreshingly different enough from most run-of-the-mill Hollywood productions to make it worth watching. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Tries So Hard To Be Cool And Funny","Date":"20 July 2009","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Here is an example of a film that tries too hard to be something it isn't.

He literally takes out a timer and does this before shooting someone. It's a neat idea that doesn't come off as threatening or 'cool', which is what it looks like they were trying to do. I did like his performances though, just the little things that the character does is annoying.I didn't care for any of the characters, except for one. Now, this is where the film really drops the ball and is my main problem with it. I thought Jeff Daniels had the most interesting character out of the entire batch, but his story is never resolved or revisited. They literally drop him out of the picture half way through and this saddens me because I didn't give a crap about anyone else.I give the film props for the Teri Hatcher VS Charlize Theron cat fight. Even if it was just for the sake of having these two cuties get the guys all riled up. Their stories needed more attention I thought and others just didn't gel well with the rest of the script.

Dusmo soon gets doubled-crossed by his partner and accomplice, Lee, in Roy's murder and left for dead only to have survived by wearing a bullet-proof vest under his jacket. The remainder of the movie skillfully has Dusmo,in him trying to get back home, involved in a number of events that have him participate in both a kidnapping and home invasion. there's even Dusmo, unknowingly, talk a desperate and suicidal man Teddy (Paul Mazursky), a failed movie and TV director, out of killing himself.

It's an uneven movie for every character that works (Spader as an icy, high-precision killer, a stunningly sexy Theron (in her film debut) as his accomplice, Hatcher as a professional athlete (good casting!), Stoltz as an earnest cop), there is one that is just a waste of space and time (Aiello as a pathetic ex-hit-man, Crutwell as an arrogant prick, Headly as his homely assistant, Mason as the nurse who likes war movies).

There are two kinds of films, roughly speaking. The `ordinary' kind deals with characters and situations, using film as an invisible mechanism. The other type acknowledges the fact that we all (makers and viewers) know it is a film and incorporate all sorts of additional devices.Mazursky has made a living by carving out a territory between these, a territory shared with John Sayles and Steven Soderbergh who each take quite a different approaches. Mazursky's basic approach is the common dramatic stance of defining characters and allowing them to interact within some contrivance. He is a favorite of actors, and is an actor himself. The unique twist he brings is the superficial recognition of the medium. It is superficial because it is never exploited for effect as true reflected films are. Its just there as an acknowledgment that unlike many of his actor peers he knows there are the two types, but makes the choice for `purity.'So we have Mazursky projects which actually feature filmmakers or are based on books in an acknowledge but not exploited manner. Now we have a disciple of Mazursky that does the same. The setup is Altmanesque, not at all like the self-referential Tarantino. In `Two Days' (I only saw 24 hours, I thought) the whole exercise is supposedly interesting characters bumping up against each other. And in the midst is Mazursky himself! Playing an actor/filmmaker, but in a way that interacts with the story with no more importance than if he were a hairdresser. The dogs literally matter more. But there are plenty of jokes about the incomprehensibility of his films the part about the elephant.Because the focus is on the characters, and because all the characters are drawn from archetypes, we have the expected redhead -- here Glenne Headly.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

He's John Herzfeld. I rate this one highly too. Herzfeld is evidently creative and talented. In both cases, what he has done is mix serious matters (murders) with some very funny moments as well as a pervasive satire on the characters. This is quite a movie.The main story is neo-noir, told in an interesting way. The different paths of the characters are introduced discretely and before too long they are brought together and intersect beautifully and logically.The cast is in great form, and well-chosen for their roles. Herzfeld as director handles the entire project very, very well indeed. I do believe that in both these movies, the IMDb ratings are too low. I might even go 9 on this one. In fact I will.Every part is well-played. The standouts here, in my opinion, are Danny Aiello as a washed-up Mafia soldier, James Spader as a criminal, and Charlize Theron as a confederate of Spader. They have the most substantial parts too. Also scoring are Paul Mazursky as a suicidal writer-director and Greg Crutwell as an obnoxious actor(?) or entertainer who has made it.The last thing I would do is reveal the plot. All I can say is that you have to be prepared to be laughing very hard at some moments but not very much later or earlier being exposed to cold-blooded shootings.As in 15 Minutes, Herzfeld upsets some but not all Hollywoodized expectations you might have about who might possibly survive a bullet or succumb to a bullet.

Ever since the Tarantino phenomenon occurred on a fateful day in October of 1994, Hollywood suddenly started making convoluted character pieces with L.A. as its backdrop (what originality the Wood has). Probably 10 Pulp Fiction rip-offs came out each year (maybe twenty, if you count the straight-to-video ones). I'm surprised that this wasn't one of those.So we have a motley crew of bland characters that all seem to intertwine with one another. There's the first cliché that reminds me of...Pulp Fiction! They are all stereotypical caricatures the sociopath hit-man (James Spader), the bumbling mobster (Danny Aiello), the rich a$$hole (English actor), his timid & mousy-someday-I'm-going-to-be-someone assistant (Glenne Headly), the blonde foreign sexpot (Charlize Theron), the beautiful but sneaky wife (Teri Hatcher), good-cop/ bad-cop (Eric Stoltz/Jeff Daniels)...Are you seeing a pattern here? And we're supposed to root for these people in this black comedy. I thought the least interesting characters as well as plot pieces were the Danny Aiello/Glenne Headly/ annoying English guy scenes. If they cut those out and expanded on everyone else, we'd have a more interesting Pulp Fiction rip-off. But instead, it was a less interesting Pulp Fiction rip-off that really does not know what it's doing (except trying to be cool).This is a slice-of-life, 48 hours in the San Fernando Valley where the cookiest things happen to the quirkiest of peeps. To me, it seemed more like a Showtime movie special with washed-out B-actors trying so hard to score publicity and resurrect ratings for the network. It had moments that were a tad more interesting than other scenes, but it never got to a boiling point. The massage parlor was interesting at first until Jeff Daniels had to exert his dark side, which IMO ruined the scene. If we saw in some flashback how Teri Hatcher's hubby was to her, we might empathize with her more. Same thing about Charlize Theron and her affair with him. And why James Spader killed Danny Aiello in the beginning. These are simply holes that we have to leap over and accept in order to enjoy the movie. The result is another mediocre, dime-a-dozen of a movie. My wife watched this on and off and finally got up before its last ten minutes. There was a lame, anti-climactic exchange of gunfire that seemed as fun as a shootout from Hart to Hart. Nothing seemed to go anywhere, but hey nothing seemed to go anywhere in Pulp Fiction either!I'd rather waste my time in traffic than watch this again!

A movie that had concentrated on the characters of Spader and Theron exclusively would have been many times better than this sad excuse for a film.Spader, as always, is great to watch. This time he is a vicious sociopath assassin hired to kill Teri Hatcher's husband. Spader has a loser, played by Danny Aiello, as his assistant. Theron is Spader's smarter than your usual blond bombshell, and tougher than your average tough moll, gorgeous significant other. Spader and Theron are outstanding together and with all the other characters and plot in the movie. Hatcher's character and Aiello's character are significantly less interesting, and then all the other characters that take up lots of time in the movie get less and less interesting the further one gets from the Spader/Theron core. The only time Spader is outperformed is by Theron and vice versa.So, who destroyed the potential of Two Days in the Valley and why did he/she/it do it? I just hope whoever is responsible is no longer working in the movie industry and is working in some boring lousy job far away from anything creative.
