This is one of the finest farces I've ever seen brought to the screen, written naturally enough by theatre farce-meister Michael Frayn.  The frenetic energy of John Cleese in his prime really lifts this above the norm, as he hitches a ride with a student, bumps into and kidnaps an ex-girlfriend and winds up naked in a monastery.  The climactic scenes at the HMC amount to perhaps the finest pay-off seen in farce.  This is, indeed, a historic moment.

Yet despite the great John Cleese reactions to the never-ending stream of challenges, his character never loses sight of his goals or his integrity.

And a very few which manage to pull it off, and remain funny to virtually everyone, over a period of several years.This John Cleese vehicle from the mid 1980s manages to fit into the latter category - it is simply such a very well crafted traditional comedy, that it is impossible not to be touched.Here we see Cleese very much in Basil Fawlty mode, as an aspiring head-teacher for whom things just don't run smooth when it really matters.The other classic elements of British Farce are there - major misunderstandings, people getting undresses, well-intentioned old ladies who say the wrong things at the wrong times, and of course Geoffrey Palmer as a straight man.And just a touch of poignant surrealism in the way the final minute leading into the credits is played out, to offset the traditional production values.It's straightforward, and unchallenging, and probably the best film about lateness ever made.

Watching it again last night (it was given out free on DVD with a Sunday newspaper) I realised what a greatly underrated, highly intelligent film it is. In fact I suspect it is a little TOO intelligent for mainstream audiences, which perhaps is why it has never been a blockbuster.What impressed me was the highly philosophical nature of the plot which deals with the artificial nature of timekeeping in modern society.Stimpson suffers from the modern disease of believing that all the problems of life can be solved by the imposition of obsessive man made order and regulation (something our present Government appears to suffer from also) in particular with regards to timekeeping. His whole identity is based on timekeeping and he is unable to relate to anything outside his own worldview. Stimpson is the classic tragic overreacher who doesn't realise that his attempts at control are actually having the opposite effect.The sense of dislocated identity is a recurrent motif in the film. The senile old ladies are not merely there for comic relief - they act as a mirror to Stimpson's own disintegrating sense of self. One of the ladies (the late great Joan Hickson) is stuck in a 'loop' of consciousness relating to sherry glasses, and the other is convinced that she is in the place she has already left, but the third lady, 'aren't we lucky people!' represents the childlike happiness of those who are literally outside time - her polite bewilderment and contented singing at the end of the film as Stimpson is led away underscore this neatly.Other motifs of dislocated identity and location abound. Stimpson drives a car which does not belong to him, and which does not belong to the girl he takes it from, who is also not licensed to use it. It is then driven in a completely random, directionless way across fields ('we don't need the track!')until it has to be rescued by a tractor which Stimpson refuses to see even though he's standing right next to it. (This particular sequence, with the Morris 1100 driving over the fields, has an almost lyrical quality to it, especially to someone who spent most of his childhood holidays in a similar car).Stimpson then spends some time in a monastery, where the characters, like the senile ladies, are outside of time in the conventional sense - almost stuck in the middle ages - again the innocent happiness of those outside time is shown by the monk cheering on Cleese in his chase after the car.Finally Stimpson makes his last ditch attempt to reach the conference in a car stolen from someone who again, does not own it himself, and in a stolen suit which does not fit him which, in a hilarious counterpoint to his own crumbling identity, falls to pieces while he is wearing it.The only thing the film lacks is perhaps a little more background on what changed Stimpson from being a hopeless timekeeper to an obsessive one, and what happened to him after he was caught.

John Cleese based the character on the head of his daughter's school, and I can tell you the real life head is just as delightfully nutty as Stimpson.Time obsessed Mr Stimpton, head of an ordinary British state school finds himself chairman of the Headmasters Conference and has to get to Norwich to address their meeting. Everything goes wrong on the way, despite Stimpson's meticulous planning, and due to his obsessive nature he gets more and more frayed at the edges as things go wrong.There are some great observations on human nature in a film which moves quick enough to keep you laughing but not so quick that you miss anything.Not perhaps Cleese's very best work, but a minor classic nevertheless. Generally under-rated as most have already said. Chris Morahan went onto continue his film directors career with the excellent thriller Paper Tiger in 1990, among others.

It's the HOPE - that's what's killing me.'  Almost the perfect motto for Scotland football supporters, you might say.Probably alone in the world, I rate this movie superior to the overly foul-mouthed and Americanised Fish Called Wanda.

It shows the events of one working day in the lives of a range of people from schoolchildren to pensioners, whose course is hilariously skewed for them all by the obsession of the film's central character.  It uses a traditional obsessive tunnel vision strategy of comedy - a character's failure to see the chaos he is causing in the lives of those who are unlucky enough to lie in the path between him and his goal.Alison Steadman plays the sassy schoolgirl who does everything she can to help her headteacher achieve this obsession, tearing him between his drive for the peak of respectability orthodoxy and her less than respectable means to achieve this goal. The comic tension between the unlikely pair seems a hilarious pastiche of the sexual tension in most hero + heroine situations.Americans may not immediately recognise the small-town England setting, which gives it a tone of Ealing comedy, but the film should greatly amuse viewers from any background.

It's the Hope I Can't Stand.","Date":"7 March 2006","Score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" In Clockwise John Cleese plays a character who has much in common with Basil Fawlty from the television series Fawlty Towers. Like the manic Torquay hotelier, Brian Stimpson is a control-freak who finds his own life going out of control. The headmaster of a small-town comprehensive school, he is a stickler for discipline, with a particular obsession with punctuality. He is the sort of man who knows the school timetable off by heart; upon seeing a pupil idling about the school he can instantly tell that pupil exactly what lesson he or she should be attending at that precise moment. (The school is, in an in-joke, named after the famous English clockmaker Thomas Tompion).Stimpson is disliked by his pupils and staff, who see him as authoritarian and patronising, but he is evidently held in high regard by the wider teaching profession, because he has been elected Chairman of the prestigious Headmasters' Conference. The film tells the story of what occurs on the day on which Stimpson is due to address the annual meeting of the Conference in Norwich. Things start to go wrong when, due to his misunderstanding what he is told by a ticket-collector at the station, he finds himself on the wrong train and ends up missing the train he should have caught. Told that there will not be another train to Norwich for several hours, he decides to make the journey by road and returns home, only to find that his wife has taken the car. He meets Laura, one of his sixth-form pupils, and in desperation persuades her to drive him on the 163-mile journey to Norwich. A further chain of misunderstandings leads to them being pursued across the English countryside by the police, by Laura's parents (who suspect that their daughter is having an affair with her headmaster) and by his wife (who suspects the same thing). On the way they kidnap a former girlfriend of Stimpson's whom they meet by accident, drive the car into a field and get stuck, find themselves in a monastery and, in their desperation to get to Norwich on time, end up holding up a passing motorist in order to steal his clothes, his money and his car.The film's central joke is that a man who is so obsessed with punctuality should find himself running very late in his attempts to get to the most important meeting of his life. Although Stimpson is the sort of man that most people would automatically dislike if we were to meet him in real life, Cleese manages to arouse a certain sympathy for his character, whose sense of panic arises from a sense that he is the victim of circumstances, that the entire universe is united in a vast conspiracy to prevent him from fulfilling what should have been a relatively simple task. His desperation is increased by the remote possibility that he might just be able to get to Norwich on time. (It's not the despair, Laura. I can take the despair. It's the hope I can't stand). There can be few of us who have not had, at some time or other, a similar feeling.Although the film is sometimes described as a farce, that word should not be taken as implying that it is a purely mechanical comedy; character also plays an important part. Fortunately, Cleese is not only a very good technical comedian- his timing in this film is superb- but also a very good character actor. (A gift shared by another ex-Python, Michael Palin). Cleese also receives good support from the rest of the cast, particularly from Alison Steadman as his long-suffering wife Gwenda and Sharon Maiden as the wild and headstrong Laura, for whom driving her headmaster cross-country is a much more interesting way of spending her day than a few hours of boring lessons.The film is not quite in the same class as Palin's two great post-Python comedies, The Missionary and A Private Function. For most of the time it is very funny indeed; for most of the first hour and a bit I was laughing out loud. (Remarkably, my wife was too- normally she loathes the Pythons and all their works). Unfortunately, the scriptwriter Michael Frayn was unable to maintain this sense of comic invention to the end. The story needed some dazzling twist to finish on, but instead it fizzles out rather tamely and the last quarter of an hour or so, after Stimpson finally arrives at the Conference, is rather disappointing after what has gone before. Nevertheless, this is still one of the better British comedies of the eighties; I certainly prefer it to the overrated A Fish Called Wanda. 7/10 "}{"Title":"one of the best comedies ever","Date":"29 September 1999","Score":"10 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I think Clockwise has been underrated.

Aside from the great john Cleese, this film benefits from a great number of other positives, including a finely worked script; that manages to stay realistic and down to Earth despite the highly unlikely nature of much of the plot, and the highly farcical nature of many of the events; which bode extremely well with the lead star, as Cleese finds himself in his element in the role of the strict headmaster. Indeed, the major reason why this film works so well is down to the former Monty Python star, as he blunders his way through the film and somehow manages to retain and air of authority while doing so. The comedy styling is one of it can't get any worse!, and it continually does; as constantly punctual headteacher, Brian Stimpson, finds himself in a world of trouble after missing the train to Norwich, where he is set to make a speech to a meeting of the best headmasters in the country. After acquiring the services of one of his sixth form pupils, he gets back on track to Norwich; but not without a number of problems.The comedy comes by way of both gags, and the plot itself, which always manages to garner a laugh or two due to its superbly silly nature. Cleese is joined by a number of British stars, who all do well in their respective roles. Sharon Maiden stands out as Cleese's travel companion for much of the film; and somehow manages to look cute despite a truly awful hairstyle. Smaller British stars such as Pete Walker's muse, Sheila Keith, Alison Steadman and Eastenders' John Bardon, who would go on to star as Jim Branning in said soap opera help to liven up the supporting cast. The film does feel typically eighties, but stays away from the more silly side of the decade's cinema and many of the jokes bend more towards the intellectual side. The film is in very good humour throughout, and therefore offers an enjoyable time for its audience. Seeing John Cleese deliver an assembly towards the start will no doubt remind anyone that was schooled in England of that time, and Clockwise does a very good job of presenting it's plot and setting. Overall, this film comes highly recommended to anyone that enjoys fun films.

It respects the tradition of farce and, despite the frenetic pace and the subject matter, retains a kind of gentle, even staid appeal.

A film for bank holidays, and perhaps more suited to TV than the cinema.

It sort of leans in and out of the other two, borrowing a little of each's style, but never quite matching either. Cleese is now called Brian Stimpson, but is basically Basil doing a different job, so you have him performing as Basil, yet on the big screen. Plus it's possibly the most bleak of all Cleese's projects.It's easy to see why Clockwise was never as much of a global hit as the other two. Fawlty Towers delighted in showing up English eccentricity, whereas A Fish Called Wanda was designed to appeal to an Anglo-American audience. Clockwise has a distinctly British feel to it, therefore, only people of a certain age will truly get it (my young daughter watched it and simply said 'Why don't they just use their mobile phones?' - ahh, to grow up in the 21st Century!).If you're a fan of Fawlty Towers and possibly the much under-rated Fierce Creatures, then you should definitely give this a go.

It's a farce, based on the premise that a normally rigidly time-keeping Headmaster struggles to get to a conference on time when thing after thing goes wrong. It is more than this, though it now stands as a beautifully nostalgic and comical look at the 80s, including an average British secondary school in the 80s. Anybody who has taught in one of those would say they were often far from 'comical', but when viewed from afar we see that life indeed is a comedy. The script alone would be amusing, but here we see how character drives it the talents of John Cleese make it positively hilarious.You probably need to be British - and a Cleese fan - to enjoy it fully. There are so many set-pieces unique to this eccentric, at times ridiculous but just about lovable nation (then, at least). From the hymn sung in school assembly, to the mannered police officers, to the dysfunctional red telephone boxes, to the countryside itself - even a monastery (In a monastery??). On a serious note I have to ask if, today, we would laugh so easily at the concept of a 6th-former being in a relationship with a teacher? Perhaps now 'Laura' is one of those who are bringing criminal charges in hindsight, 25 years later? Okay, not funny. No, wait, come on - it is!

While I did find the film's structure occasionally episodic, the pacing sometimes a little too fast and the direction a tad on the leisurely side, it is a hugely enjoyable farce. The chief element that makes it so is the performance of John Cleese, his comic timing assures yet another really funny performance. He has been better but he is still the John Cleese I know and love. Sharon Maiden assists him well too, she really stands out among the cast who all do more than acceptably. The script is inspired and the sight gags are even better, the soundtrack is good and the camera work is fine. The film is typically 1980s, and that is not a bad thing, quite the contrary.

I've always had a soft spot for this movie and am glad that others seem to share this sentiment. It also doubles as a showcase for John Cleese, whom you will see here in an, as I think, far more complex and likable role than as Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers.In the DVD extra you can see Cleese wondering why this movie didn't fly in the USA, when several years later other typically British movies such as The Full Monty were roaring successes there. Good question. For one I think that US audiences simply don't care for the perils of an English headmaster, whereas a bunch of good-natured social dropouts doing something outrageous has much more universal appeal. I think that Clockwise's main problem in this department is however that it lacks international star power -- maybe if they had given the part of Laura to Julia Roberts or Michelle Pfeiffer, things might have turned out differently. As it is I think the producers made an excellent choice in Sharon Maiden, who is playing her very difficult role excellently. Too bad we didn't see more of her afterwards.I think this was an 8-pointer but I'm giving it 9 points just because it's such a darn likable movie.

He is due to attend a conference in Norwich, but unfortunately this seemingly straight forward trip proves to be anything but this and Stimpson finds himself facing setback after setback.Whilst watching Clockwise, I couldn't help but feel that I was basically watching a feature-length episode of Fawlty Towers. This, in part, is down to Cleese's portrayal of Stimpson which he plays in a very similar manner to Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers. If you think about it the plot elements and scenarios that Stimpson faces aren't too dissimilar to Fawlty Towers - Stimpson, like Fawlty, is generally well-meaning, but ends up finding himself in fairly precarious situations more often not through basic misunderstandings. There's nothing wrong with any of this per se, but if you draw comparisons with Fawlty Towers (which it's almost impossible not to do if you've watched that series) then this film comes off as not being as well written or as funny. That's not to say that it isn't funny because it is, but it's only sporadically funny and isn't a laugh riot or ROFL funny.Cleese is excellent in this film - whether he's playing it straight as the uptight head master or resorting to blind panic in the latter parts of the film it generally works and I found him to be funny in both respects. I also thought that the late John Bardon was great fun in a minor role as a train station guard. There were other performances that weren't so great; I thought that Sharon Maiden was rather bland and wooden (It's no surprise that she didn't have a great career after this film was made). Steadman has become reliable in later years, but I didn't think she was great in this film (although in fairness she wasn't given much to work with).Clockwise is a film that I would recommend watching, but it isn't a laugh riot and is only sporadically funny. To be honest, I thought it started to run out of steam towards the end. As I've mentioned, Cleese is excellent and really carries the film and it's worth watching for his performance alone.

A simple mix up over right and left sees him miss his train and also miss a lift from his wife.

The narrative arch sees us establishing the strictly organised Stimpson before then spending the rest of the film gradually putting him through increasingly comic blunders and delays as he tries to get to his destination on time. It is nothing that special or clever and the events are never that unexpected or imaginative. Personally I rarely laughed out loud but was reasonably amused by it throughout. Morahan's direction is pretty by-the-numbers and his touch is too obvious to be of much help.Cleese is the whole show and it is down to his playing that the film is worth even looking at. Sure his performance is not a million miles from characters he has played before but he is still good. His timing and awareness of his own absurdity helps the material. The rest fall in behind him but mostly the film is all about him and he is rarely offscreen. Overall then an average comedy that is more or less what you expect but should do enough to amuse if not have you roaring with laughter.

He plays Brian Stimpson, the strict, demanding headmaster of a private school. His big character detail is that he lives life by the clock. Everything must be done when it is scheduled to be done. Therefore, it becomes an unending headache for him when everything goes wrong while he is on his way to speak at a headmasters' conference. Before the day is over, he'll have the cops after him, he'll enjoy some R & R at a monastery, he'll hitch a ride with Laura Wisely (Sharon Maiden), one of his students, and he'll hook up with an old acquaintance, Pat (Penelope Wilton).This enjoyable little effort seems somewhat forgotten when one looks at Cleeses' career. Therefore it could use some more exposure. Seeing that it takes place over the course of one day, it's paced pretty well, and everybody in the cast gets into the spirit of the thing. Young Maiden is appealing as Laura, and the top notch British cast also includes Stephen Moore, Alison Steadman, Joan Hickson, Pat Keen, Sheila Keith, Tony Haygarth, and Geoffrey Palmer. Cleese is perfect as the anal retentive, somewhat uptight person who gradually loosens up, a la Steve Martin in Planes, Trains & Automobiles. And just like that other film, there is a certain lunacy in what can only be described as a comic nightmare. Things just keep getting worse for Stimpson, and you can't help but feel bad for him while also chuckling at these misadventures.The ending is not all that satisfying, but getting there is still fun.Seven out of 10.

I'm very fond of so much of his filmography, from the Python series and films, to A Fish Called Wanda to Fierce Creatures and of course, the near perfect Fawlty Towers.Because of this, I was recommended Clockwise.I was expecting a feature-length symphony of chaos and Cleese-humour; Fawlty Towers, but given a budget and a 100 minute run time to wreak havoc for Cleese's character.However, Clockwise is anything but.The biggest problem with the film is its pacing. It is almost unbelievably slow. Of course, a slow buildup is often a benefit in such comedies; the story and circumstances slowly burn towards a riotous explosion of comedy, like Fawlty Towers has so often done. But in those instances, the slowness worked because we were always aware of the threat, of the tension, of the promise of what trouble is bubbling below the surface. In the case of this film however, I was bored almost to the point of turning off the movie.Clockwise features entire scenes where characters do essentially nothing, or engage in so-called 'antics' that are virtually free of tension, suspense or humour. The scenes in the monastery, in the country fields, in the phone box or by the side of the road completely drain the film's energy. The very point of the movie is for us to feel the importance of every second tick by, to race against time, to be terrified of the prospect of being late--of missing the engagement. However, although Cleese's character is set up to be bordering on near obsession with these things, by the midway point he has seemingly abandoned these qualities and drifts through the film, even remarking that he doesn't care anymore. This character trait change is completely unprecedented, and makes no sense, to say nothing of how it drains the film of drama and comedy. I won't even touch on the bizarre and absurd sequence in which Cleese and his student take another man into the woods to steal his clothes by offering sex. It's barely usable in theory, and in execution, the scene is utterly groan-inducing.The second major problem refers to the characters themselves and the way the film handles them. An entire slew of supporting characters are introduced (badly and uninterestingly), each of them supposedly being set up to antagonise and confound Cleese when he finally arrives. After we spend the whole film slowly and numbingly reaching Cleese's engagement, these characters are virtually forgotten, merely wandering into his speech session to distract him for a moment before being seated. The explosion of comedy and awkward confrontation, as was done so marvelously in A Fish Called Wanda, Fierce Creatures and Fawlty Towers, never occurs at all. The film's climax barely even occurs, and when it does, it's merely signposted by Cleese giving a bizarrely disjointed speech; a scene which doesn't seem to know whether it's suggesting that Cleese has lost his mind, or is merely winging it. Frankly, at this point, I didn't care. The subplots and ultimate conclusion of the story are never resolved. The film simply stops. Having Cleese's character no longer caring is fine, but this fact is never properly established.Finally, the performances are either painful or boring. Everyone but Cleese seems to have turned their 'annoying-stereotype' meter up to eleven, screeching, whining and giggling in the most absurd ways. Meanwhile, Cleese himself plays the film surprisingly straight and subdued, barely every reaching his trademark levels of Basil Fawlty hysteria. This, despite the fact that he finds himself in situations that would make Fawlty collapse in agony. Naturally, I understand that we are dealing with different characters here, but since the film which to such arduous lengths in the first act to set up Cleese's neurosis, the fact that he sleepwalks through the rest of the film is genuinely bizarre.Ultimately, Clockwise is incredibly disappointing, and, despite the apparent love of it in certain circles, I feel should be avoided at all costs.It's begging for a remake to inject some tension, suspense and genuine comedy into this simple concept.

It's really fails here, a real fatal blow, considering the fine cast, yet still as I said, it is quite an adventure to say the least. When I say John Cleese is a stickler for time, I mean it. In one of what I consider his best performances, among others, like in A Fish Called Wanda, he plays headmaster, Brian Stimpson, who's been invited to a headmaster's conference, regarding getting special funding to improve his not so special college, or something like that as I can recall.

Driven to extremes, Cleese, is forced to borrow a student's car, as well as steal one. He loses it with a payphone, accidentally backs into another vehicle, while also bathing and getting scrubbed up in a monastery, after his suit gets caked with mud. The free spirited tractor guy, I'll never forget. By the end of the film, Clockwise becomes quite serious and not so a comedy, which it was only a half comedy to begin with.

Cleese manages to capture nearly the same incompetence as Basil Fawlty for his character, it is not your typical road movie comedy, it might not hilarious, but it is pretty funny stuff, so it's worth trying, at least once. Okay!

Director Christopher Morahan is unable to do anything with Michael Frayn's terribly bland plot, which is full of unfunny antics and awfully ridiculous situations. Some mildly effective humour is not enough to save the picture.Even ingenious British comic John Cleese is not able to transform the mirthless goings on, and being typically typecast doesn't help his cause. Luckily for the lanky comedian he was able to bury the memory of this disaster, and thus resurrect his career, with A Fish Called Wanda.The support cast are totally uninspired, and George Fenton's music is not much better. Put plainly, Clockwise is never wacky enough or straight enough. This disappointment tends to sit on the comical fence, which inevitably backfires.Sunday, December 17, 1995 - Video "},{"Title":"*YAWN*","Date":"27 March 2002","Score":"2 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I know some people in the US that say to me You must not really appreciate British Comedy if you don't like this movie. Considering I have over 100 tapes of British Comedy that you can't get in the US, I think I know more about British Comedy than average in the US.That said, I found this movie, slow, boring, uninspired, and rather predictable. I would rather watch John Cleese as Basil Fawlty or in A Fish Called Wanda. There is nothing new or unique about this movie. It falls far short of what I would call good comedy, let alone good British comedy. It was a huge disappointment for me. Still, it left an impression on me (It's been 10 years since I saw it). Sadly, it was that of being bad.Maybe if I watch it again today I would change my mind, but I want to be clockwise and not risk wasting the time again. Once was enough.

I found that movie to be extremely boring, and did not even smile once.  I found the comedic style to be pathetic, and I was feeling bad for the actors throughout the whole film.I think that the sense of humor is very cultural and can hardly be compatible between cultures.  To me, the best comedy comes from France and from Québec, and seeing how many people loved this poorly written movie is far from convincing me otherwise.That said, Peter Sellers is one of my best actors.  The movie The Party is amazing and I must have watched it over 20 times.  I can't possibly understand how John Cleese can be considered a comic actor in comparison to Sellers, the greatest master of comedy.cheers, melkiades  "}]
