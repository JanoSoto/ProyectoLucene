[{"Title":"Frankenheimer's Rosebud...","Date":"16 December 2003","Score":"41 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I can imagine the pitch for Reindeer Games being thrown at the execs behind the picture...Okay, it's about this guy, who's not who he says he is, who everybody thinks he is, who fools these guys who thinks he is, falls in love with this girl who thinks he is, even though he isn't, and they try to pull a heist with his expertise, even though he has none.Nick (Ben Affleck) has just been released from jail for defending his girlfriend in a fight prior to being thrown into the slammer. Upon his release, a long-time pen pal named Ashley (Charlize Theron) greets him and they immediately hit the sack. However, her brother (Gary Sinise) wants Nick to help them pull a heist on Christmas Eve at a local Indian casino, which is run by a money hungry wannabe (Dennis Farina). Her brother kidnaps Nick, holds a gun to his head and commands him to draw up a sketch of the security points in the casino, since he used to work there and knows all there is to know about the casino. There is one minor detail, however, that may hinder their plan.Nick is not Nick.Nick is really a car jacker who overheard his jail cellmate, Nick, reading his letters from a penpal named Ashley aloud. Nick was killed before his release in the jail cafeteria, and so Nick took his identity so that he could meet up with the infamous Ashley he kept hearing about, forming a mental picture of her in his head.If you stop to take the time and think through all the minor details of the film's plot (especially given the twist ending), you'll probably arive upon the conclusion that it's all a bunch of bull. It simply doesn't make sense if you really take the time to think it through.If you don't put your brain to work, however, you'll find yourself having fun watching director John Frankenheimer's last film. Frankenheimer was a talented director, the man behind such films as The Manchurian Candidate, Seconds and Ronin. His last feature was one of his most stylish and brutal, fast-paced, funny, and often just fun to sit through.Gary Sinise (Forrest Gump, Ransom) is his usual villainious self, while the real surprise comes from actress Charlize Theron, who switches character a lot through the film, especially towards the end, and is a real beauty and delight to watch. She's the film's high point, and though people criticize the plot, I found Reindeer Games mildly inventive with its shifting twists and turns, even if they aren't always so believable.The film's downfall is its ending, which feels as if the filmmakers got caught up in all their twists and turns and unconsciously wrote themselves into a wall, then suddenly slapped on a cheesy, cliched ending with a sentimental good guy closing scene. It's rushed, silly, and doesn't fit in with the rest of the film.Irregardless of its uncountable flaws, Reindeer Games (or Deception as it is called in the UK) is a fun film, John Frankenheimer's final movie. Reindeer Games is often linked as Frankenheimer's long-time dream picture, much like Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America. Like a dying man's final words, perhaps it conveyed some hidden meaning to Frankenheimer. Or, maybe everyone was wrong. Maybe Reindeer Games is nothing but another Frankenheimer film, this one not as good as most of his others.But Rosebud didn't mean anything to anyone except Charles Foster Kane. Maybe Reindeer Games meant something to John Frankenheimer. However, as anyone who has ever seen Citizen Kane probably knows, it's not likely that we'll ever find out what it means, even if we try.3/5 stars.

Great plot twists, great acting, great actors, great story. This movie kept me enthralled the whole way. It was when Affleck still had his charisma from Good Will Hunting. Charlize Theron dazzles us with her smile and charm and Gary Sinise is sinister as the intimidating older brother. My only complaint was there were one too many plot twists in the end. Otherwise, settle in for a smooth ride.My favorite part of this movie are the prison sequences at the start and the final scenes. The prison sequence was very well done and Affleck is immediately identifiable as the likable car jacker. The final scenes are a great touch after the explosions, a nice touch to an enjoyable film. Sinise's fellow gang members are excellent as well, their intimidation tactics and craziness well transmitted to the screen.See this movie around Christmas time. It may hold some more value.

After hearing endless stories during his incarceration of Nick's romantic correspondence to a woman named Ashley he has never met (CIDER HOUSE RULES's Charlize Theron), Rudy is looking forward to returning to his family and having a fresh cup of hot chocolate. When Nick is killed during a prison riot, Rudy decides to assume Nick's identity upon release from prison and meet up with the unknown woman. Burdened with a base knowledge of Nick's Indian casino employment past, Rudy finds himself in too deep with Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and is violently forced to cooperate with a casino robbery that Gabriel and his gang have been planning with Nick in mind.From an original screenplay by Ehren Kruger, REINDEER is very much in the same vein as his last script ARLINGTON ROAD. While much more of an action film than the paranoia drenched ROAD, REINDEER holds it's deceptions very close to it's heart as well. Who can you trust, and for how long? Helmed by esteemed director John Frankenheimer (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, RONIN), REINDEER seems keenly aware of it's inane story, yet he keeps pushing the proceedings along briskly, trying to keep this casino heist plot afloat with good actors and a passable script. It's fun just to watch this tale unfold. All the professionals involved know this material isn't CITIZEN KANE, but as action films go nowadays, REINDEER's restraint is it's most endearing aspect. No pop culture references, not too many exploding fireballs, and Frankenheimer keeps the edit count down. REINDEER GAMES is a far more classy film than it's brethren.It takes some time to get used to Ben Affleck as a tough ex-con. His baby face and peanut brittle voice do little to sell him as an action hero. As REINDEER trudges along, you get used to watching him act tough. It isn't the best performance that's come out of him (I'll save that honor for DOGMA), but Affleck is a likable enough guy and makes Rudy a character you want to see save the day. Imagine an aging lead vocalist for a Black Sabbath cover band and you'll have an idea what Gary Sinse looks like in REINDEER. He always makes a great passionate villain, but this time he takes his appearance one step further and actually looks like a threat. Charlize Theron keeps improving as an actress, but it is her new brunette look and honey smile that one takes away from her performance. She looks lovely in the snow, but not too much presence beyond that. The whole cast is somewhat stuck with Kruger's elementary script, and they all try hard to overcome it. It ends up being their individual charms that make REINDEER come out a winner.I liked REINDEER GAMES for the throwaway Christmas thriller that it is. Taking advantage of the topical Native American casino boom and deliberately waltzing away from many clich√©s, GAMES is a pleasure to enjoy. We need more of these. ----- 8  "},{"Title":"Decent, but not special","Date":"15 December 2004","Score":"28 out of 39 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Reindeer Games is about an ex-con who has taken over his cell mate's identity, so he can run of with the other guy's girlfriend when he gets out of jail. Of course not everything goes as planned. Not only does he get the girl, he also gets a lot of trouble, because some other criminals wanted to use his cell mate to rob a casino. He doesn't know anything about the casino, nor about robbing one, but if he doesn't help them, they will shoot him immediately. So he helps them robbing the casino, wearing a Santa costume, because it is Christmas...The concept is quite good, but of course not very original. In fact the whole movie is professionally done, but not that special, so don't expect anything innovating or new. However, when you can forget that for a moment you'll have some good fun watching it. Only at the end it really failed, there were just too many explosions who aren't really doing any good to the rest of the story if you ask me.But no problem, at least it's something different than The Sound of Music or Home Alone which you'll normally see around Christmas. It offers decent fun, without excelling once, so that's why I give this movie a 6/10.

The ruse goes awry when he is also mistaken for Nick by a gang of thugs (headed by Gary Sinise) who recruit him in their planned heist of an Indian casino at which Nick had been employed.Like 52 Pick-Up, Reindeer Games has a central character whose flawed behavior puts him at the mercy of dangerous individuals who conceive a scheme that spins out of control.  52 Pick-Up was successful because the entire cast, beginning with Roy Scheider as the trapped hero, was equal to the task of bringing the grittiness of the material to the screen.  The one significant problem with Reindeer Games is the casting of squeaky-clean Affleck as its central character.  Through no fault of his own, Affleck looks like a lightweight alongside a supporting cast that includes Sinise, Clarence Williams III, Danny Trejo, and Dennis Farina -- all actors who look like they have lived a little.  Affleck cuts a profile similar to that of Scheider, but without the lived-in look that made him convincing as someone who would be able to go toe to toe with his tormentors.Reindeer is helped greatly by the performance of Theron, who, while also young, always has been able to project a more adult presence like the young Kathleen Turner.  Credited more for her on- and off-screen glamour, Theron often is underrated as an actress.  Here she conveys equal parts sweetness, intelligence, dismay, and ferocity.  Of course, she also livens up her sensual scenes.  For many actresses, nudity itself is the extent of their sexuality, but Theron generates heat simply by looking comfortable and bringing an unforced quality to the proceedings.The other major plus is Frankenheimer's direction, which turns an adequate screenplay into a solid thriller.  He keeps the story moving and handles the action scenes economically, avoiding the excesses of Michael Bay, Simon West, and other directors of MTV-inspired fireball-fests.  As in Ronin, the action actually stays within the bounds of plausibility, which makes them more involving.

I don't feel it's one of those so-bad-it's-good sort of movies, but the script relies quite a bit on chance and one of the plot twists, though quite fun and unpredictable, is a bit on the implausible side.  The likelihood of this situation panning itself out the way it did here isn't very high, but the film works because of John Frankenheimer's direction, the charismatic cast, and the dark humor.Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck), a car thief, and his cellmate and best friend Nick Cassidy (James Frain) are two days away from being released from prison.  Rudy just wants to return home to his family, while Nick plans on meeting with his pen-pal girlfriend, a beautiful woman named Ashley (Charlize Theron).  Unfortunately, a food fight breaks out in the prison cafeteria and Nick is killed, leaving Rudy with a dilemma.  When he's released, at the last moment, he decides to pose as Nick to Ashley.For the first few days, this is Heaven for Rudy.  He and Ashley click immediately, and they make love in a motel.  However, returning back to the motel from some shopping, he's ambushed and beaten by Ashley's brother, Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and his men.  Having read Nick's letters and discovering he'd worked as a security guard at the Tomahawk Casino, he plans to use Rudy (whom he thinks is Nick) to help him rob the casino.  Rudy has to now find a way to convince everyone he's Nick and get out of this situation alive.From the opening scene featuring five dead Santas in the snow, Reindeer Games had me riveted.  It's a fine way to open the film, giving the feeling that something disastrous has just occured, and it piqued my interest. Using the flashback method in this film is effective, which may now be considered tiresome in films overall, but it works here.After The Island of Dr. Moreau, it looked as if though director Frankenheimer's career was almost over; then came Ronin, an action thriller that featured some exciting shootouts and one of the most brilliant car chases ever filmed.  Reindeer Games still features Frankenheimer doing a first-rate job.  While his direction is far from flawless (he has a pesky insistence to shoot many, many close-ups) he does an excellent job creating suspense and believable action scenes.Reindeer Games tries to work as both action and suspense, and for the most part, it succeeds.  The action is refreshingly not over-the-top in the how do we top the next stunt style seen in so many Jerry Bruckheimer or Joel Silver blockbuster films.  Frankenheimer injects tension into the gunplay, fistfights, and chases, and these scenes work better than they probably could have in another less talented director's hands.Ehren Kruger wrote the script, and he puts in a lot of dark humor.  There are a lot of funny moments, due mostly to Affleck trying to ad-lib and convince everyone he's actually Nick.  Of course, Kruger is also (in)famous for plot twists that just about nobody can predict, but are also wildly improbable.  Actually, Reindeer Games' final plot twist is perhaps more likely to occur than the twists in Kruger's other scripts (Scream 3 and Arlington Road).  Speaking of that twist, let me just say that you might or might not figure it out almost exactly a minute before it happens.  Unlikely or not, there's no denying that last twist is a lot of fun.Director Frankenheimer and screenwriter Kruger also seem to know what the audience wants from this sort of movie, and they fill it with everything they can, including violent action, the dark humor, the twists and turns, as well as a good dose of sex and nudity, provided mostly by Charlize Theron. The fact that she's a lovely woman doesn't hurt matters at all.The cast plays a major part in the film's success.  Ben Affleck has proven he's one of cinema's most charismatic young actors.  His Rudy Duncan is character you can root for the whole way through because Affleck molds him into a likable and energetically funny persona.  Gary Sinise chews the scenery big-time as the villain.  Let's face it, he's easily one of the best actors around and it's somewhat of a shame to see him play a role like this when he's easily suited for something more complex, but he has so much fun in the role it's hard not to feel his enthusiasm.  Charlize Theron doesn't really get a whole lot to work with.  She has only a few modes, mostly just relegated to smiling or crying, or looking lost or angry.  The supporting cast mostly consists of Gabriel's henchmen, which include Clarence William III, Donal Logue, and Danny Trejo, all of whom deliver okay performances. The only other cast member with signifcant screen time is Dennis Farina, who tries to chew the scenery like Sinise, but isn't half as effective or memorable.Of course, not everything in the film is effective.  The film has a dark tone and atmosphere almost the whole way through, and it creates more unpleasant scenes than are welcome.  You also have to wonder about the intelligence of Gabriel and his men; they simply don't have a lot of it. They get fooled by Rudy a little too easily and after a while, it feels like they give him too many chances.But ultimately, those are my only true gripes with the movie.  Reindeer Games hardly takes itself ultra-seriously, and as a result it's a fun ride virtually the whole way through.  There's nothing truly innovative or brilliant at work here, and the film's certainly not saying anything deep; it's just for entertainment value, and all the elements work together well to create an enjoyable and fast-paced thriller.

Thriller with Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron  . Instantly I thought I would be watching something similar to NIGHT OF THE HUNTER , yeah okay Ben Affleck sure ain't Robert Mitchum but the plot sounded very similar . Unfortunately what let's this movie down is the script along with the star So I should have guessed that Affleck wasn't going to play a bad guy , but let's face it he can't play good guys either - he is a very poor actor who only became famous because of his connection with Matt Damon which goes to prove it's not what you know , it's who you know that's the key to success . Pain , mortal fear , angst - Affleck is unable to portray any of these negative emotions and considering his character Rudy/Nick spends much of the movie getting beaten up and threatened this is a major draw back to the movie . Nice to know we won't be seeing him in too many movies in the future and if Matt Damon is looking for a new best friend I'd happily nominate myself . Let's do lunch Matt . Thankfully Gary Sinese and Danny Trejo ( Check out this guy's bio ) manage to carry the film with their performances The screenplay by Ehron Kruger doesn't play out like NIGHT OF THE HUNTER , the  Man stealing the identity of his dead cellmate  subplot is just used to set up the story and if anything resembles CLIFFHANGER with a bunch of bad ass gangsters holding their victim hostage to get what they want . There's lots of chases in the snow and the occasional passer by getting bumped off but there's some ridiculous plot holes . For example Rudy and his girlfriend are drowning under the ice so Rudy uses his gun to shoot his way out of a watery grave . What he can fire a gun under water ? And there's a scene where Rudy is shackled to a bed . He then manages to break free , go to a swimming pool to discover a plot twist , go back to the hotel room he is held hostage and dupe one of the bad guys into believing he's still shackled to the bed by having the bed rest on his foot , then the action cuts to the morning where Rudy is taken out to the villains' van . It's just that come the morning none of the baddies has noticed that Rudy has dismantled the bed to escape his shackles . Little things like this ruin the DECEPTION's thriller elements . I know in these type of movies you have to suspend disbelief sometimes but here you have to suspend it a little too much for the movie to be effective . And because it's John Frankenheimer's last movie many of the reviewers seem to slightly more forgiving about this thriller's faults than I am "},{"Title":"Winter Blunderland","Date":"16 August 2000","Score":"10 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Ben Affleck plays Rudy, a con just trying to go straight (are there other kinds in the movies?), waiting for his imminent release. He and his cellmate Nick each have plans of enjoying themselves once they get out of stir. Nick's involves meeting and spending the rest of his life with a woman he's never met, a pen pal named Ashley (Charlize Theron). Ah, but the best-laid plans and all that go horribly awry when Nick is slain a few days before they're both due to be sprung. What a coincidence! Naturally, Rudy pretends to be Nick to Ashley, discovering her to be quite the cutie. You see, he's just gotten out of prison, hasn't been with a woman in years, and.... Well, anyway, he hooks up with the gorgeous Ashley, and all is well - for a few hours, anyway, until Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) shows up and demands Rudy/Nicky help him and his gang - who have never robbed anyone - pull off a heist of a local Indian casino. Of course, Rudy, being Rudy and not Nick, doesn't know a thing about the casino (Nick was a guard there years ago). And he tries to tell Gabriel that. But wouldn't you know it, the creep just won't listen! (Bad guys are like that.) So your basic plot involves Rudy trying to help/not help these guys with their evil plan, and of course they'll stop at nothing, and of course things go wrong, etc. Oh sure, there are a few plot twists, and some will have you guessing, but my bet is there's going to be a lot in this movie that you've seen before. And if you think the plot's relatively ho-hum, with few surprises, then you're left with the performances of the three main leads.Ben Affleck is miscast, in my opinion. His character's not terribly likeable (I mean he DOES lie to Charlize Theron, after all), but that's not his fault. Affleck's problem is that he combines arrogance with tough-guy attitude and thinks it makes him multifaceted. No, Ben, it makes you look like a jerk. A better choice for this role might have been Edward Norton (Fight Club). Norton can play tough with foibles, and I don't think Affleck has that ability.Charlize Theron is outstanding. She delivers a deep, stunning performance that produces new wrinkles with each scene. Much like Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity, Theron is crafty, essaying more in those bewitching eyes than most actors can in an entire soliloquy.And Gary Sinise? He's Gary Sinise. He's sinister, he's mean-spirited....he's the heavy. He's the bad guy, folks, and Sinise has played this role a few times, so he knows what he's doing. Oh sure, maybe his character is nothing more than a cardboard Bad Guy role, but hey, that's more the fault of the screenwriting than it is of the actor, so I won't blame him. I've seen his talent range, and I know he's got some. (See Of Mice and Men or The Green Mile or Ransom.)Bottom line - it's not exactly filled with the kind of twists that'll keep you guessing, but it's not too bad. It is, however, a bit of a comedown from the director of The Manchurian Candidate. But fret not, friends - it is, after all, a rental at this point, and it's worth the $3.50 or so.

This slick thriller is action-packed and fast moving but also tense and very violent at times. The plot is complicated by numerous twists, mistaken identities and double-crosses and also a bunch of characters that are often very unpredictable. Characters called Rudy and Nick and a soundtrack full of Christmas songs contribute to the strong Christmas theme which is maintained throughout and the regular humorous moments provide an effective counterpoint to some of the more unsavoury things that happen on screen.Rudy (Ben Affleck) and Nick (James Frain) are a couple of cell-mates who are serving out their final few days in prison. Nick has, for some time, been corresponding with a young woman called Ashley (Charlize Theron) and tells Rudy how much he's looking forward to meeting up with her when he's released. Rudy replies that he's simply looking forward to going home and enjoying some pecan pie and hot chocolate.Shortly before he's due to leave prison, Nick gets killed in a mass brawl during which he also saves Rudy's life but as Ashley knows nothing of this, she waits outside the prison for him on the day when he's scheduled to be released. When Rudy leaves the prison and sees the beautiful Ashley, he decides to assume Nick's identity and the two of them then leave for a passionate evening at a nearby motel. Their fun soon comes to an abrupt end, however, when Ashley's psychopathic brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and his gang suddenly turn up.Gabriel knows from reading Nick's correspondence, that he used to work at a casino and now wants to make use of his knowledge of the business to enable him and his gang to rob the place. Rudy tries to explain that he's not Nick but Gabriel won't believe him and Rudy soon realises that even if he convinces Gabriel that he's not Nick, he will probably be shot because, as Rudy, he would be of no value to Gabriel. A series of rapid developments follow and Rudy winds up participating in the casino heist with the rest of the gang who are all dressed in Santa Claus outfits. Further surprises then follow before Rudy's nightmare finally comes to an end.Reindeer Games gets off to a really intriguing start when the dead bodies of a number of Santa Clauses are seen lying in the snow and the story that led up to this situation is then told in flashback. The plot twists that follow produce a number of funny and surprising situations until the story finally concludes in a way which doesn't really bear too much scrutiny.Ben Affleck is tremendous as the unfortunate Rudy who, after making a bad decision to impersonate Nick, finds himself in more trouble and danger than he could ever have imagined. Charlize Theron is consistently good as the femme fatale who goes through a number of shocking changes and Gary Sinise looks incredibly evil and menacing as the villain of the piece.

So obviously he went ahead with something like Reindeer Games. Clearly this must be the Citizen Kane of the 21st century everyone's been waiting for. It was just a matter of time. The movie works well on so many levels, it's frightening. We all knew deep down in our hearts that the old geezer still had it in him. Bravo.First of all, this reminds me a lot of Long Kiss Goodnight; plenty of snow, plenty of the Christmas spirit, plenty of idiocy. It's almost macabre how dumb the plot and the plot twists of this movie are. So basically this whole huge, elaborate scheme was designed by Theron and her ex-con boyfriend so that someone else would rob the casino?! Could a heist be any more complicatedly planned?!! This is one of the most far-fetched, laugh-inducing premises since Dressed To Kill! There are so many logic problems with it that there is absolutely no point in going into detail. And the logic is just one of the problems the movie has.The casting insane, absurd, laughable. Affleck as a prisoner in a jail?? I don't think so. Affleck as an inmate who taunts a big black convict??? I think not. Affleck the tough guy who cracks jokes every time Sinise's gang break a couple of his ribs???? Surely not. Affleck might steal his mommy's chewing-gum but you don't go to jail for that. Theron as a sly, evil, scheming, genial criminal mind?? Maybe in Citizen Kane's Blood The Fantasy Continues II. And what's with Sinise with long hair again... He was funny with long hair in Forrest Gump. Wasn't that enough? A repeated joke is never as funny the second time around. What kind of instructions did they get from Frankenheimer? Okay, Gary, you will be a smiling, sneering psycho in an action thriller. You, Charlize, you shall be a sniveling broad in a romance movie, and then you'll overact your way as a sinister criminal genius through a dumb Depalmesqian thriller/comedy. And you, Ben, you will play it for laughs you are in a comedy. You're not funny, but who cares. This is basically the first half of the movie Affleck cracks joke. Sinise hits him. Theron cries. Sinise asks if he is the real Nick. Affleck lies. Affleck cracks joke. Sinise hits Affleck. Theron sobs. Affleck runs away. Sinise catches Affleck. Sinise asks Affleck if he is the real Nick. Affleck cracks joke. Sinise hits Affleck. Theron cries. Sinise hits Affleck. Affleck cracks joke. Sinise hits Affleck. Affleck cracks joke. Theron cries. Etc. The second half is like this dumb surprise twist. Another dumb surprise twist. Action. More dumb twists. Dumb action scenes. A twist. Absurd action scenes. Final twist. Affleck gets revenge. Everyone's dead. Affleck is happy. At the end there is even Affleck moralizing in an attempt to make Theron the Evil Bitch feel guilty about everything! And the worst thing is that it succeeds she actually starts justifying herself to him! They're all like little five year-olds here! This is just too dumb for words.No doubt that Frankenheimer can make the next Citizen Kane, but only in his dreams, whenever he is lying next to a swimming pool on a Hollywood party/orgy, all doped up with heroin. Is this movie a comedy, a parody, a thriller or what? None of the above. It is a piece of s***, however. A special movie category suitable only for those rare works of utter crap.I think Frankenheimer did the right thing by casting Charlize Themoron. She is infamous for saying how much she enjoyed Turkey when she was in its city of Budapest. Such a tiny mind is an ideal match for this dumb movie.

It's a lightweight plot, but veteran director John Frankenheimer directs with an assured hand, making good use of close ups, noirish dutch angles and much dark humour.Most appealing, though, is the film's festive atmosphere. The entire plot unfolds over the Christmas weekend, every scene filled with snow capped scenery, Christmas decorations and hot chocolate. This lends the film a cosy and somewhat funny ambiance, Frankenheimer's rather dark caper contrasting nicely with the homey holiday season.The film ends with a great sequence in which Affleck, dressed as Santa Claus, walks around town with a big bag of cash, distributing stolen loot amongst the local homes. Prior to this, though, is a silly scene in which the real bad guy is shockingly revealed to the audience. It's a needless twist that is wholly illogical.Still, if you overlook this narrative misstep, the film is lots of fun, and makes a good companion piece to Fargo, A Simple Plan and Bad Santa. Charlize Theron is sexy, Gary Sinese is scary and the usually intolerable Ben Affleck turns in a good performance.8/10 &#x96; Frankenheimer made many excellent films over his long career &#x96; Ronin, Birdman of Alcatraz, Manchurian Candidate, Seven Days in May, Black Sunday, Seconds, 52 Pick Up, The Train, French Connection 2, Gypsy Moths &#x96; but largely spent the 90s making TV programs or hack films solely for the cash. Reindeer Games was chewed to death by critics, but its unrated cut is a fun crime film with some witty post-Tarantino one liners. Worth one viewing.

Highlight of the film - Afleck's disguise - so that no-one will recognize him he dons a ten gallon hat and a mustache like the edge from U2. Works a treat. Looks just like Afleck wearing a ten gallon hat and a moustache like the Edge. Great for laughs though not meant to be funny I think. Most tedious feature of the film - the gang keeps threatening to kill Afleck and each time he escapes them they meat out some justice on him in the form of violence. However, considering they never do actually kill him it becomes painfully apparent just how empty their threats are - to the point where the viewer no longer has to sit on the edge of his seat but can sit back safe in the knowledge that these criminals will never kill Afleck no matter what he does to them. Why, is never completely clear. They probably just liked the mustache I guess.

One prime problem is that Afflick is just never convincing as a joint hardened car thief.  When he is inside prison, he looks like a nice suburban kid acting like he is in prison.  He is almost never convincing in this role.But ultimately, the problem with this movie is in the number of plot twists that Frankenheimer throws at the audience.  Rather than build a plot, all too often when interest begins to lag, Frankenheimer introduces a double cross, a character who was already killed or some such nonsense.

I was crushed. I have great difficulty understanding how the director of the subtle, lyrical thriller Ronin could have created and put his name to this mindless and miscast sequence of irrational plot twists and dull, meaningless physical beatings and chases. Plot twist is too nice a word for the unmotivated interminable reversals and red herrings. Viewers who don't always follow plot closely may easily lose track since it makes no sense.It tries and fails to be several things at once. It is primarily plot driven, but the plot is so ridiculous and full of holes and arbitrary reverses that one quickly ceases to bother predicting what will happen next. It's never surreal (might have helped) but it is so illogical. There is extensive brutality and gun play, but it is mostly of little consequence and seems more played for laughs. The entire climactic casino shootout seemed more comic than dramatic. Gary Sinese and his men's interminable beatings of Affleck have little dramatic impact after the initial one. The gun choreography is lazy with little sense of care or threat. There are moments meant to be comic, mostly Ben Affleck mugging, but virtually none of them work. There are multiple love affairs but these are just more red herrings to keep the plot tottering along--not one of them is convincing or deep.We're left with what I guess I'd call a dumb guy's popcorn heist movie along the lines of ; something that keeps us lurching forward with gunfire, the pounding score and the moving camera and letting us know that if we don't care about the current scene, something disconnected and brutal will be along in five minutes. CGI is missing; instead we get overacting. I cannot fathom how a script development process arrives at this conclusion. Nonstop unmotivated physical abuse is not interesting to most audiences. The lovers of cinematic mayhem will be so much happier with any Tarantino film or The Raid or even Jack Reacher where every fight means something and has a consequence. Here the violence just continues on repeat, with no one changing or learning or even dying for most of the picture.

"},{"Title":"Tis the season","Date":"11 November 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" If John Frankenheimer's Reindeer Games provided me with any sort of advice, it's not to neglect nineties/early-2000's action cinema. During that time, many action films were released, boasting names like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Steven Seagal and usually served as nothing more than cinematic timekillers or blatant star vehicles for muscular men catering to an audience that beared heavy testosterone levels. From my very limited acquaintance with the genre, it seems the attractiveness of these films was their inanity and their craziness, along with their often far-fetched plot-points, far-from-realistic instances, and technical and aesthetic imperfections that are now widely different from the glossy, overly-polished action filmmaking techniques we're used to today.But who would've thought the actor to jump on this train would be Ben Affleck and the director to capture this moment be John Frankenheimer? This, unfortunately, marked a sour time in Affleck's career, as nearly every mainstream effort he did seemed to garner nothing but negativity, and was Frankenheimer's final directorial effort before his death in 2002. This isn't necessarily the best film to conclude a career like his on (he directed the original Manchurian Candidate and Seven Days in May). It's quite possible that if I saw this back when it was out, given the director's list of renowned films, I would've hated it. But if there's anything that has changed about me in recent years, I'm beginning to love a silly, completely ridiculous thriller or action film. Preferably, but not restricted to, those starring Ben Affleck.Reindeer Games takes the cake for being one of the most asinine films I've seen this year in terms of plot, twists, and character motives. Characters possess unrealistic, confused ideas, for being such confident criminals, the storyline in itself is a muddle of complete buffoonery, and don't get me started on the twist ending, which is convoluted and almost too ambitious. I'm aware this sounds like the making of a negative review, but damn, I'd be telling an unforgivable lie if I didn't say I got some weird, B-level entertainment out of Reindeer Games. Here's a little diamond in the rough boasting A-list actors, an intriguing little premise, and several settings there are at the mercy of their actors in terms of the way they're utilized.Ben Affleck plays Rudy Duncan, a car-thief currently serving time with Nick Cassidy (Nick Frain), his cellmate. Nick has been writing letters to a woman named Ashley, who is the only person that seems to bring Nick any kind of happiness in life, unlike Rudy who has nothing but basic middle class life to look forward to upon his release. A day before Rudy and Nick's release, a prison uprising results in Nick's death, and realizing that Ashley will now be left alone, he decides to assume the identity of Nick in order to at least have some affectionate love, a caring soul, and some great, if violent, sex upon his release.Arming himself with the knowledge he has gained from Nick's letters to Ashley, Rudy exits prison with the adopted personality of his former cellmate and meets Ashley (Charlize Theron). It turns out, Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and three of his friends planned to rob the casino Nick used to work at and utilize him as a source for information regarding the building and the whereabouts of the casino's safe. Ashley confesses to Nick (Rudy) that she wrote to him with this in mind, and despite Rudy imploring that he isn't Nick and faked this entire thing to earn the company of Ashley, he is forced to go along with the robbery at hand.For starters, Gabriel and his thugs are some of the most listless robbers in movie history. They have a vague plan, they have little intelligence on their side, and they are often blocked by their own pitiful ineptitude. This is noticeable immediately after Rudy confesses he is not Nick. They don't believe him but threaten to kill him. Then Rudy says he is Nick. Then he isn't Nick. This goes back and forth for about five minutes in a confusing manner, so that we can't even be truly certain how the robbers plan to justify that he is Nick (or isn't).But such things like this become in the back of our minds when we see the craziness the film continues to release. Consider what Rudy looks forward to upon getting out of prison (six months of eating nothing but leftovers among other things he states in a corny monologue the film begins with and ends with). But when he agrees to help Gabriel and his band of goons, what does he request? Some goddamn hot chocolate and some pecan f****** pie. You couldn't find a better line in this film (although Gabriel referring to Rudy's stalling as reindeer games comes pretty close).Besides the film utilizing intriguing settings, such as a large hotel and a spacious casino, with a nice sense of placement and activity, the film can be known for having some at least above average performances, particularly from Gary Sinise. Sinise works as a menacing villain, somewhat reminiscent of a Steve Buscemi kind of character with the straggly hair and the intimidating grimace. Affleck and Theron, for a brief time at least, have solid chemistry, even if their sex is more violence than sensual. Then there's appearances by Isaac Hayes (in a role stranger than the sex-obsessed, dirty-minded chef in a school cafeteria) and Danny Trejo that can guilty bring a smile to someone's face.Reindeer Games is pure entertainment, briskly-paced, constantly moving, and very active in the suspense department. There are noticeable restraints on the material, given the crudely-strung together subject matter and purely ridiculous plot-points in some cases, but there's fun in the film waiting to be had for an absurdly optimistic viewer looking for a supremely different kind of Christmas picture. Come all ye faithful, I suppose.

All of this comes about when Affleck (substituting for a man (played by James Frain) stabbed with a shiv in prison, who was his cellmate) meets the author (Charlize Theron) of letters pinned for Frain, read to him. Affleck himself fell in love with Theron through those letters, but it isn't long before he's accosted by Sinise's brood and expected to help them rob a casino. This film has two/three twists that challenge any existing credibility that remains left over from entire ridiculous sequences that rescue Affleck from certain death, and there are multiple, long-winded expository back-and-forths between heavies and Affleck endlessly explaining Haha, I got you! The last one involving Frain and Theron was the straw that broke the camels back for me. I could barely swallow the James Bond delays in killing off Affleck, with the film's villains finding convoluted means to bump him off just so the screenplay could allow him plenty of time to come up with an escape plan. All of this said, time has mellowed me quite a bit towards Affleck. I like him a lot now, and his performance in the film didn't bother me at all. He has some fun actors to work off of. Sinise lays it on mighty thick, but the part requires lots of psychopathic tendencies. Of course, Clarence seemed to remain in employment just because he could play with relative ease those cold-blooded heels that accompany the likes of Sinise's ringleader&#x85;he always had the look casting director's must relish when a human monster is required. Logue seems out of place if we look at his career after this particular film, while Trejo can just appear and convince as a bruiser willingly following this rogue's gallery of homicidal scumbags. Thankfully, Frankenheimer's direction has lots of energy and pizazz attempting to compensate for a screenplay that tests our tolerance for character stupidity. Theron, like she was in 2 Days in the Valley (1996), is a feast for the eyes and libido at this point in her career, but the twists regarding her ulterior motives as it pertains to the heist were just too much for me personally. She can play the bitch, though; there's no denying that. At least, the ending is gratifying in that all the criminals get their just desserts; and they all deserve what they get for being so dumb.

Ashley's brother has read the letter and he and his gang decide to snatch Nick (or Rudy as he claims to be called) and force him to help plan their robbery. Obviously though, Rudy knows nothing of this casino and faces a no-win scenario of coming clean about is identity (and being killed) or giving them false information about the layout (and being killed).Despite the arresting opening scene that sees a group of dead Santas lying in the snow, this job gone wrong thriller actually is pretty ordinary and perhaps it is understandable why it made comparatively little money at the box office. I'm not saying it is a bad film because it isn't, it is just very much par for the course in terms of the genre. It engaged me for most of the first half because I was sticking with it to see where it would end up but once the twists starting coming then it all got increasingly silly. The biggest twists are not just silly &#150; they are out and out ludicrous and the script doesn't even bother to really explain them. This damaged the film because it just seemed lazy writing (which of course is probably what it was) and it just stopped me caring (which is just as well considering how poor the ending is when it finally comes).The cast features lots of names but nobody really has much to work with. Affleck is pretty average; I don't really have anything against him but he just didn't fit the character. Sinise is a better fit while Theron gets naked and, seemingly unable to work out who her character is, just overplays any chance she gets. Support is solid enough from Trejo, Hayes, Williams, Farina and a few others. None really have much to do in regards the material but they fill out the gang the genre requires.A nondescript genre film then. At best it ticks all the boxes but as it goes on the twists become increasingly silly and any viewers still gripped by it at this point will be likely to stop caring.

Which is a turnaround for me, because when I first saw it years ago I wasn't too impressed. Last year I saw it on vacation around the holiday season on TV though, and found myself enjoying it. It's not the greatest movie, and much of it is ludicrous, but it's packs a mean spirited, sleazy punch and keeps up a nice wintry atmosphere to keep you warm on a cold night, whether from the booze or the bullets. The film gets shat on a lot, especially by star Charlize Theron who famously said she only did it to work with Frankenheimer, but I think it's way more fun than people give it credit for. Ben Affleck back in the sordid chapter of bis career, plays a recently paroled convict who's on his way to meet his cell mate Nick's pen pal girlfriend, pretending to be him. Nice guy. She turns out to be a sweetheart in the form of Theron, and things look up for old Ben. Until, however, her volatile, psychotic gangster brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) shows up with a pack of thugs who have a notion to rob a casino that Nick used to work at, using him as an inside man. Only, he isn't Nick, and has no idea about the casino, forcing him to think on his feet and stall his way through the dangerous predicament. Sinise is a guy I'm usually indifferent too, or bores me, but here he's a wide eyed, brutish lunatic and really has fun with the role. Theron is appropriately sexy and enigmatic, and there's standout work from three tough guy actors I really enjoy, playing Gabriel's henchman, sporting the delightful monikers Pug (Donal Logue), Merlin (Clarence Williams III) and Jumpy (Danny Trejo). They're like the three ill tempered elves to Gabriel's raving Santa, and steal the film. Dennis Farina plays loudmouth, dirtbag casino owner Jack Bangs, James Frain has a silly bit, and there's a demented cameo from Isaac Hayes (monsters in the gelatin!!). It's a loud, dumb flick and it knows it, but it also knows how to have a good time in style.

This may very well be his worst film. Affleck delivers a laughable performance while Charlize Theron is cardboard as this conniving bimbo. Gary Sinise plays the villain who forces Affleck to rob casinos. The role allows him to constantly jab Affleck with a gun. Perhaps it was a reflect action having gone from Forrest Gump to this crap.

This is supposed to be an action comedy, but there's almost no comedy, so the action comes off looking stupid.I'll set the stage a little but, I don't want to talk about the plot too much because there are many built in twists that would be spoilers.

Nick has a pen-pal girlfriend who he's never met, and she's a fox as you see in the pictures she sent.  Her name is Ashley and she's played by Charlize Theron.  Nick has constantly read all of Ashley's letters to Rudy. She is all he can talk about as they are about to get out but Nick gets stabbed in a brawl before he gets out.  So Rudy pretends he's Nick upon his release so he can be with her.  Just as the romance is getting going, Ashley's brother Gabriel shows up because he found all of the letters from Nick to Ashley.

There was quite a lot of buildup to the casino robbery, but when it finally got there, not much happened. The ending was very good. Just when you think you've identified all the twists, there's another one right there.Rudy (Ben Affleck), a car-thief, and his cellmate Nick (James Frain), a guy who killed another man while defending his girlfriend, are both about to be freed from jail when Nick is murdered during a lunch fight. Rudy decides to pretend to be him when his pen-pal-like girlfriend Ashley (Charlize Theron), who never met Nick before, comes to find him. The two really hit it off and things are going well, until Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) finds Rudy and threatens to kill him if he doesn't help them get into and rob a casino, which the real Nick previously worked at.The plot is actually pretty cool, but it's hard to believe that this bunch of idiot-thieves would really believe that this was the real Nick, even after he told them time after time that he wasn't. There are many great twists at the end which leads to an unpredictable, although somewhat unbelievable, ending. The characters are pretty cool, about half of which turn out to be different from whom you originally thought.Ben Affleck, new to the action genre, did a pretty good job. After proving himself to be able to play very different parts, like in Dogma, Armageddon and now this, I think he is really going places. Charlize Theron did an OK job as well as the mysterious girlfriend of Nick. Gary Sinise stole the show. I really like this guy. Boy can he act! He's played so many different characters very well. Gary doesn't do as well as the villain as he did in SNAKE EYES or RANSOM, but he still did a very good and believable job.The main flaw in this movie was the lack of action until the end. The casino robbery itself should've been more action-packed, like it seemed on the commercial. Even in the ending there was more irony and surprise than there was action.

I walked out of the theater content. It was a good movie. The plot had many twists and turns. The character of Ashley took on many different forms and she was always a mysterious character. Ben Affleck played a somewhat convincing role in his crude yet heroic character of Rudy. The acting in this movie was fairly good. The action wasn't the entire basis of this movie. It did have a solid plot and was enjoyable to watch.   However, there were some missed opportunities to make this movie great. First, the special effects at the end with cars flying off cliffs was pathetic. It looked like a toy truck falling down the stairs! But I can handle that. What really bugged me was the 'bad guy' at the end explaining the whole plot of the movie in a 3 minute speech to Ben Affleck before his impending doom. A true film artist would have wound the movie in such a way that this plot all came together and made sense without it being handed to the audience on a silver platter. Make us think, damnit!

Obviously, with landmarks like these, its going to be a rocky trip, and, judging by the gaping hole in the jolly belly of one unfortunate Kringle, it's a journey with a not-so-happy ending.Ben Affleck is the Rudolph in our little story, guiding the plot.  The metaphor is hard to miss, as his character, a car thief just getting out on parole, is called Rudy.  Rudy's cell-mate, Nick (alaus, perhaps?), has had a five month relationship via the post office with a lovely girl named Ashley (played with flat-faced pluck by Charlize Theron).  Once he gets out of the slammer, Nick will finally get to meet the girl in the pictures, and Ashley will finally get to see what Nick looks like.But, alas, Nick is stabbed with a shiv before he leaves, and its up to the lonely and (I'm guessing here) sexually frustrated Rudy to approach her under the guise of his late cellmate.  Ashley and Rudy hit it off and consummate their relationship.  Of course, things go downhill from there.Since the late Nick once worked in a casino, he is wanted by several thugs to lead a heist on his former place of employment.  Heading off our gang of rowdy ragamuffins is Gary Sinise as the extremely unattractive head bad guy, Gabriel.  Sinise plays his part with sneering extravagance; his performance is one-note, and although it's a decent note, it drags the speed of the movie down.  With a body twice as big as his head (obviously he bulked up for the role) Sinise never really achieves a believably threatening level of villainry.  Because his menace is only partially convincing, the movie only partially works.  What is lacking is the followingOur protagonist, Rudy, mentions a number of times that he is not Nick. He'll say he's not Nick, his life will be threatened, and then he'll say he is Nick.  This sequence happens about four to five to seventeen times in the movie.  Gabriel is either an idiot, or he's an idiot.  Although screenwriter Kruger has given us an element of suspense by adding confusion as to how much Rudy does and doesn't know about Nick and his past, he also succeeds in aggravating the plot with the continuous frictional contrivance that is Rudy's inability to make up his mind about his identity.  Because Rudy changes courses so often, Gabriel's own threats against his life are called into question, and since Rudy can't die (at least not until the end, if at all), Gabriel must pretend to believe Rudy's pleas that he IS Nick, and the audience must shift about in their seats some more.There is no skimming here of the good ole' elements of all traditional action movies every element is present and accounted for right down to the cheesy bad-guy-reveals-his-plot-right-before-leaving-the-hero-in-an-easily-escapabl e-death-trap scene.  Don't look for unexpected twists or turns, but just for blaring guns, hallway running shots, and plenty of sex.  It is a Frankenheimer film.In a lot of ways, Reindeer Games wants to be more than it is.  The craft of the filming and the clarity of the cinematography aren't weak by any means, but the movie essentially fumbles most critically where its plot is the thickest.  In the end, you're left watching a movie that, while eminently entertaining on the most superficial of levels, is still just another excuse to watch guys shooting each other.

The first element is the intelligent stylish action films, like director John Frankenheimer's previous film RONIN.  The other element is the loud and brainless action films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.  But taking these two elements and making it into one film is fun yet brainless.      Ben Affleck stars as Rudy, a man who's been in prison for the last five years for grand theift auto.  Rudy and his cellmate, Nick (James Frain) are both about to be released, and what perfect timing.  It's the Christmas Holiday in a few days, and Rudy is looking forward to be spending time with his family.  Nick however has different plans, he's spending his holiday with a striking beautiful woman named Ashley (Charlize Theron), to whom he's written to while in prison.  Then Nick does get fatality wounded during a prison riot, so Rudy has feelings for Ashley and decides to tell Ashley that he is her pen-pal.  Things are going great for Rudy until when coming back to the motel, they get a unexpected visitor.  Four men are waiting to meet this former prisoner, who all think it's Nick, when it's Rudy, especially Gabriel (Gary Sinise) who is Ashley's cruel brother.  Gabriel heard that Nick use to work ata Indian casino, so Gabriel wants Nick (when it's Rudy) to help them rob the casino on Christmas Eve.      From there on it's a non-stop rollercoster ride of twist and turns.  There are plenty of action scenes to keep one entertained, yet the logic of the film is sort of silly.  But I did enjoy REINDEER GAMES, since I had my brain turned off while I was watching it.  The acting in this film is decent, Affleck proves that he can carry a film and be a likeable action hero. Theron is extremely beautiful in this film, and her acting is also decent.  But I did enjoy the wicked personality of Gary Sinise in this film.  He proves that he can be cruel and twisted, without being silly or cheesy.      But the strongest and weakest portion of this film is behind the scenes.  The direction by John Frankenheimer is great, and after coming from high success of RONIN, Frankenheimer proves that he's doing top-notch thrillers again like he did with THE MANCHURIAN CANADIATE.  But it's the dialogue and some of the scenes written in the film that are at fault.  The writer gives Sinise some good dialogue as a villian, but Affleck witless punchlines and catch phrases as if he was in a DIE HARD film.

After about the fifth time, this scene loses it's suspense. It's pretty obvious that Ben's gonna get out of it. 2) Ben Affleck doing something for Gary Sinise, messes up something, and then runs away while getting shot at, eventually getting caught, usually accompanied by yet another scene with Sinise holding a gun to Affleck's head, or some variation thereof. 3) The plot twists without any warning or credibility, and Mr. Naive (Affleck) still doesn't realize that maybe it's time to screw this whole deal and jet.At the end, it felt like the director looked at what he had, figured it wasn't worth it, and plowed the movie into the ground by adding the bar none stupidest plot twist that has ever been put into a movie.

It's sad to see that the scripts he's forced to work with are as bad as the low points of his seventies and eighties hack jobs. Ehren Kruger, the author of REINDEER GAMES, was handed SCREAM 3 by Miramax, and it's easy to see why REINDEER mooshes together RESERVOIR DOGS, CON AIR, CASINO and a handful of other influences, and ratchets up the twist-o-meter to the point of psychotic implausibility. It's the kind of through-the-duck-press script in which a bad guy hands the hero a Santa suit as a disguise for a big robbery. The accompanying dialogue? Guess. Tis the season...convict!The premise is that a good-guy car thief (Ben Affleck) is about to get out of prison. His cellmate is due to get sprung the same day. (How's that? Never mind.) The cellmate has been carrying on a correspondence with a girl who just loves convicts--and she happens to look like the South African supermodel Charlize Theron. (Are we supposed to...forget it.) The cellmate gets a shiv in the ribs, Affleck gets released, and, sure enough, he runs up to Theron and pretends to be the cellmate. If you haven't been turned off by the dialogue of the two white cellmates, which resembles that of two upwardly mobile college guys sharing Jagermeister shots at a TGI Friday's, then you have an opportunity to be repulsed by Gary Sinise as the bad guy, Theron's truck-driver brother. Sinise once had a reputation as an actor's actor. He has become the Anthony Zerbe of the millennium--and now, with this movie, Charlize Theron has become its Elke Sommer.That leaves us with Frankenheimer, whose compositions are so beautiful and bulbous, so heavy on portentous closeups and so light on the Tony Scottish, prettified lighting of contemporary action movies, that he seems to have raised the bar permanently on this sort of genre material with RONIN and his work here. I can't praise his work with actors (even stalwarts like Clarence Williams III and Danny Trejo annoy) and he doesn't make the script look one jot less noisome than it is. But he knows how to compose and cut this stuff in a way that makes the Renny Harlins and John McTiernans of this world look like drooling idiot man-children.

It is not a film to be taken seriously at all, but one to be very entertained by, and this high energy flick entertains for just about every single minute of its running time. This is yet another grand-slam piece of moviemaking by longtime director John Frankenheimer, who's last film, 1998's Ronin took the action film to a whole new level.I can never seem to get enough of Ben Affleck. The guy is simply a solid actor, one who's always eager to please, and one of the best of the younger actors out there. His groundbreaking work in the previous film Dogma proved that he can fufill any role that comes his way. He's certainly on a roll with his career now, being that his other new film Boiler Room, which I have had yet to see, opened exactly one week before this film. He's always terrific playing guys who are nothing short of astonished by the situations they're involved in. Here, Affleck is perfectly cast in the role of a down-on-his- luck ex con Rudy Duncan, who is released on parole. Upon his release, Rudy spots a beauty named Ashley (Charlize Theron), a secret admirer of his cellmate Nick, who was just killed in prison riot. Rudy assumes Nick's idendity in pursuit of a little passionate love.Enter Ashley's psycho brother Gabriel, played to manic perfection by Gary Sinese, still a very underrated talent.

With this wreck of film from John Frankenhemier, the streak of bad action films continues unabated. Action/Adventure films are my very un-guilty pleasure of going to movies. While I've matured to look forward to the fall and winter seasons that bring with them a proportional higher number of quality, serious works, it is the summer that is the apple of my eye. Put your brain in neutral, grab some Raisinettes and head for the seats in the sweet-spot. I'm sure I caught a few You said it, brother's coming in across the ether from others so inclined. In other words, I was pre-sold on liking Reindeer Games. An ex-con blackmailed into helping a crew of thieves pull a casino heist at Christmas? I'm there baby, I'm there. I would have really been psyched if I had remembered that John Frankenheimer was behind the lens of Ronin as well.  What turned this Reindeer into roadkill instead of Grade A venison? I finger the writer, Ehren Kruger.  If I pointed out he was also behind Arlington Road and Scream 3 I'm sure many out there will tell me I should have been forewarned, but I must claim ignorance as I truly didn't know. If you thought those two were bad, Reindeer Games is worse. I get the feeling Kruger once said I want to write a movie with a big, surprise twist at the end and Reindeer was his warm-up for Road. I'm really fearful now for two more films he has coming out this year Impostor and Texas Rangers.Ben Affleck, who should have been a good choice to play a car thief, is expected to inhabit a character who is much harder than he can pull off. At least the prison we meet him in is much tougher than Affleck could have survived without becoming the local pump. The rest of the cast, including a completely wasted Dennis Farina, are well suited to their roles. It's a pesky problem with logic that derails this would-be thriller.This is one of those films that asks you  not once or twice, but repeatedly, to accept that characters will always do what other characters expect and predict them to do. It asks you to accept that the bad guys can act like bad guys out in the open (at one point, Gary Sinese and his gang pull a NRA wet-dream of weapons out of a car trunk NEXT TO THE CASINO THEY WANT TO ROB!). That characters who are play-acting would do things that only make sense if they aren't play acting (sorry, but any less vague on that one and I'd spoil one of those twists for those who read this and STILL want to pay good money just to see Charlize Theron naked).What's really depressing is when you look back on it, it should have been decent. All the elements are there (interesting setting, smart hero, clever ways to kill people). Either Kruger can't get past the point where he comes up with these elements and puts them in a workable script, or he is so busy (5 movies coming out in the space of about one year must be some sort of record) that he ignores the cardinal rule of screenwriting writing is rewriting. All of those released so far needed a few more runs through the word processor. I might have to go to Westwood, where The Matrix has returned to the big screen to celebrate its technical nominations, to cleanse myself and reaffirm my faith in Hollywood's ability to produce Movies For Guys Who Like Movies like nobody else on the freaking planet  "},{"Title":"The games are over; this movie ended in a tie with me","Date":"26 February 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  There were parts of the movie I liked and there were parts I hated.First of All, Ben Affleck was unconvincing in his role.

The Upper Peninsula of Michigan has not been the location of too many motion pictures, except perhaps for Anatomy Of A Murder previously. And that was forty one years before Reindeer Games premiered.It's a heist drama which stars Ben Affleck as a newly paroled con from Iron Mountain prison who hijacked a few cars back in the day. Two days before his release Affleck's friend James Frain who was also to be released gets himself shanked in prison. Frain has been writing to this girl on the outside played by Charlize Theron and Affleck who has the same needs that other newly released prisoners have sees an opportunity for satisfaction of same with Therone if he poses as Frain for a bit.But before that happens Theron's brother Gary Sinise breaks up the happy party with two of his fellow truckers, Clarence Williams, III, and Danny Trejo. They wanted Frain to be the inside man on a job robbing a casino on Christmas Eve, a night that is notoriously slow in gambling houses. In fact the gambling house they want to rob is an Indian run casino called the Tomahawk which someone had the bright idea would boost tourism in that thinly populated region of the Upper Peninsula and the Tomahawk is not taking too many gambling scalps on a good night.To keep himself alive Affleck's got to string everyone along. But the film is loaded with some really nice twists in the end. And Theron isn't quite the airhead she first appears to be.The three hoods, Sinise, Trejo, and Williams are a really sinister trio who'd soon murder Affleck because they don't like his looks. He has to keep one step ahead of them mentally. Sinise especially is one scary dude. There is also a nice performance from Dennis Farina who plays a Las Vegas high roller who can't make a go of managing the Tomahawk and just wants to go back to Vegas.There's lots of action in Reindeer Games with some interesting character development and plot twists that would be worthy of Hitchcock. Reindeer Games was a fine film for John Frankenheimer to end his big screen career with and I think you'll agree if you see Reindeer Games.

Most of these, of course, are sentimental feelgood comedies, but John Frankenheimer has come up with a new breed of bird; the Christmas crime thriller.Rudy and Nick, two prisoners in a Michigan jail, are both approaching their release date, set for a few days before Christmas. Nick tells Rudy that when he gets out he is most looking forward to meeting his female penfriend, Ashley. Although the two have been writing to each other regularly, and Ashley has sent Nick several photographs of herself, they have never met in person.Unfortunately, shortly before his release, Nick is killed during a prison riot. Rudy, attracted to the beautiful Ashley, pretends to be Nick when he is released, introduces himself to Ashley and the two begin an affair. This, however, proves to be a mistake. Ashley has a brother Gabriel, himself a thuggish criminal, who kidnaps the pair. Gabriel has learned that, before his imprisonment, Nick worked as a security guard at a casino, and thinks that Nick's inside knowledge will help him and his criminal associates to pull off a robbery there. Rudy protests in vain that he is not Nick; Gabriel refuses to believe him.It is at this point that the problems begin. The film is far too reliant on that over-used plot device, the twist- the sudden development which reveals to the audience (and often to the hero as well) that the truth is the exact opposite of what they had previously believed it to be. This film contains not one but two twists which suddenly reverse the direction in which the plot was travelling. For the benefit of those who have not seen the film I will not say what those twists are, but I can say that I found neither remotely credible. Now although the twist is over-used, it can sometimes be effective, especially when it produces a development which is unexpected in terms of what has gone before, but which leads to a conclusion more satisfying and plausible than that towards which the plot had previously seemed to be leading. (A classic example is the famous twist at the end of Clouzot's Les Diaboliques).In Reindeer Games, however, the two twists have precisely the opposite effect- that of converting what had originally seemed to be a believable, if somewhat routine, thriller, into the purest nonsense. The villains appear to have exercised their ingenuity in devising the most complicated scheme imaginable when it is obvious that their purposes would have been much better served by a simple one. No criminals would ever behave in such a way in real life; the only reason they do so in this film is because the scriptwriter thought his audience would prefer a complex plot to a simple one.Visually, this is an attractive film. Charlize Theron looks stunning, and the director's use of the snowy winter landscapes against which the action takes place is highly effective. (The point of setting the film at Christmas-time- there are many Christmas references, and at one point the villains all dress up as Santa Claus- is presumably to make some ironic contrast between the `season of goodwill' and the manifest ill-will that most of the characters bear towards the rest of the human race). In terms of its story, however, this is a silly film, wholly devoid of credibility. It is sad to remember that John Frankenheimer was earlier in his career the director of such fine movies as The Birdman of Alcatraz and The Train. 4/10.

Oh how I love the Christmas feeling. Most action yarns take place during the hottest day in New York, Los Angeles or some place similar. Very few movies step outside the summer-like boundaries. Probably something to do with budget, but I like it when they don't opt for a place and seasonal setting we've all seen before a thousand times. So I was optimistic about Reindeer Games. Let see we've got the Christmas theme going, loads of snow and in place of a crowded airport, we have a casino heist plot and stuck in the middle is the likable Ben Affleck. Pass the eggnog would you please.When Reindeer Games starts, we are introduced to Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) and his cellmate friend Nick (James Frain). Over the time they've spent together in prison, Rudy has become sickly aware of Nick's regular correspondence with a girl from the outside that neither whom have met, Ashley (Charlize Theron). Nick often talks about Ashley much to Rudy's dismay. He's sick of hearing about her. Rudy just wants to get back to normal life while Nick dreams of being together with Ashley. Unfortunately things take a turn when that same day a prison riot breaks out in the mess hall and Nick is killed. Suddenly Rudy finds himself out of prison impersonating Nick when he meets up with the sad Ashley. Unbeknownst to him however is that Nick used to work at an Indian Casino and told Ashley through correspondence and problem is Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) now has plans for Nick involving him in the robbery of the casino he used to work for. Of course Nick isn't really Nick.The movie isn't without it's bumps however. To some the story might be considered predictable and it doesn't do itself any favors when some noticeable holes are exposed along the way. Surviving that as we near the end, the whole thing comes very close to becoming completely ridiciclous with some twists and turns that verge on going overboard. On the plus side, Affleck is able to carry his role well enough and the unique setting helps the flick stand out. Worth a view on a slow night with minimal expectations, but just don't watch it in the dead of the summer.

He is inspired by his best friend Nick (James Frain), a guy who is also going out at the same day of Rudy. Nick exchanges letters with a kind and sweet girl, Ashley (Charlize Theron), and she gives this man the strength he needs to deal with the horrors of prison. When Nick is stabbed to death during a fight inside the Messroom, Rudy decides to pretend that he is Nicky in order to conquer the girl's heart. But he didn't count on the fact that Ashley has a dangerous brother who read all the letters Nick made to her, and now wants him to be part of a risky plan  to pull off the perfect casino heist during Christmas. A truly exciting and compelling movie, Reindeer Game came on the right time, bringing originality and quality for a gender that is in the I.C.U. thanks to bombs like Get Carter and Mission Impossible 2. This is a one-off, a masterpiece built by the guy responsible for classy and unforgettable blockbusters. Reindeer Games carries a kinetic, wall-to-wall energy like those good old fashioned tough-as-nails movies of the golden era of Hollywood, using quick cuts, intelligent camera movements and a dry and direct style of telling a story.

The dialogue was lame. The action was uninventive. The characters were uninteresting. The actors were on autopilot. I expected a lot better from the likes of Ben Affleck, and Gary Sinise. For them to even consider making this movie was a bad career move (or they were in it for the money). They had to throw in some gratuitous nudity to keep people interested.How many times was Rudy almost shot dead because he kept saying he wasn't Nick. It was repetitive. Why didn't they just shoot him. It was repetitive. Why didn't Rudy just leave when he had the chance when he got out of his Hotel Room. By then, he'd already discredited Ashley as a genuine, caring lover.Anyway, there's too many things wrong with the whole plot, it wouldn't be worth the while going over each and every flaw.

So, in fairness, it's not entirely my type of movie to begin with. I wanted to see what was so special about Ben Afleck, and Gary Sinese as a villian seemed interesting. Having said that, I was disappointed that this movie contained so much shouting and gratuitous violence. Sinese would have been better off to play his character at something under 90 decibels of volume. Violence on the screen gets tiring for me when it is presented as an attraction in and of itself, as it is in most action movies, including this one. And when Charlize Theron goes topless in the swimming pool it seems more a calculated move to get a few more horny 18-year-olds in the theater than a plot advancement. The only remotely interesting actor in this film is Dennis Farina as the casino manager. As for Afleck, I couldn't see what's so special about him.

This story has more holes than a colander and it gets more ludicrous as it progresses.It starts out well plausibly enough.  Upon release from prison, Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) impersonates his cellmate Nick (James Frain) in order to get with Ashley (Chalene Theron), his lovely pen-pal girlfriend.  After a short frolic, Ashley's evil brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and his thugs kidnap Rudy, thinking he is Nick.  It seems Nick once worked as a security guard in a casino that the thugs want to rob.  The film is intriguing to here, but a succession of dubious situations and plot twists mar what started out as a good setup.Ehren Kruger has given us some good scripts (Scream 3, Arlington Road), but in this story he tried to be a little too clever and it bombed.  There was a lot of exceptionally bad dialogue.  Rudy had at least two opportunities to make a clean getaway and decided not to.  Various bad guys had at least half a dozen chances to kill Rudy after he had outlived his usefulness, but they all decided it would be better to talk with him for a while to give him time to figure out how to wriggle out of it.  There were so many holes in the plot, Kruger felt compelled to try to patch it up with explanatory dialogue near the end.  The ending was so far beyond inconceivable that it bordered on moronic.Director John Frankenheimer did a very nice job with the camera, giving us a great variety of innovative perspective shots, and pacing the film well. The action scenes and stunts were also well done.The acting was terrific by the entire cast.  It is a pity that they didn't have better material.  Gary Sinise was nefarious and slimy as Ashley's evil brother.  Chalize Theron was wonderfully duplicitous as Ashley, all dewy eyed with Rudy at first, then playing the helpless victim, and later as the cold-hearted woman with the pistol in her hand.  That was quite a range and she was fabulous in just about every scene.  Ben Affleck might have been a little too nice to be Rudy.  Though he was only a car thief, he just didn't seem much like a convict.  Still, he has good screen presence, and he carried the role off pretty well.I rated this film a 6/10.  I subtracted three points for the dubious plot and another point for the absurd ending.  The acting and directing were marvelous, but the story was so flawed that it couldn't be redeemed.

Reindeer Games is a film about low-key criminals, small time people and a good story that keeps the proceeding moving for the relatively brisk, but enjoyable 98 minutes. Rudy Duncan, released from prison, assumes the identity of a friend stabbed in the big house, and shacks up with his gorgeous pen pal (Charlize Theron), only to get mixed up with her crazy brother (Sinese) and his cronies.  Duncan is forced to take part in a casino heist, and amongst the film's run time, there are enough double crosses, chases, nuded scenes, suspense and plot twists for several movies!

Gary Sinise plays her brother -- an arms runner who wants to use the dead friend's talents to help hold up a casino. I could suspend the disbelief here and there and try to hold back laughing over some of the inane implausibilities (when he escaped from his hotel room for instance, why didn't he try and hide out? Why didn't he steal a car and bail once he realized who --plot spoiler--Charlize really was?) but the real problem with this film is it's lead. Affleck is an ok actor but he's not 100% believable as a con. Had they cast someone older, say a Willem Dafoe-type this film could have been a true classic. Also, the guys who make up Sinise's gang are all excellent, veteran, character actors who hardly have anything to do but look menacing. The few lines they do have (like the one guy who gives his reasons why America should have two Christmases a year) are pretty hilarious. Yet, to give baby-boy Affleck more screen time, I have a feeling that a lot of their lines were cut. They end up as being mere props for Sinise to yell and scream at. A pity. What could have been a great film is a mere ok action flick. Also, the film's conclusion -- in keeping with Hollywood's insistence on creating happy endings -- is a true sap-fest.

The plot twists are preposterous, and Gary Sinise's henchmen in the film are the same bumbling caricatures you see in the standard action vehicle.  Nevertheless, this is a fun movie.  The actors and director never try to play it off like a serious action movie, and just utilize the far-fetched mechanics of Ehren Krueger's overwrought script.  They just decide to have fun with it, which I wish audiences would have done as well.  There's lots of comic relief.  I love Ben Affleck's pecan pie line.  I repeat that line over and over again, whenever I can.  And I like the line he says at the end, Rule #1  Never put a car thief behind the wheel!  Those who haven't seen the movie yet will find out the significance of that quote when they do.  Speaking of comic relief, Dennis Farina delivers some good laughs, as the corrupt casino owner who wants to move his business to Las Vegas.  In Vegas, there is no snow.

Rather a shame that its a moderately thrilling film that was critically lambasted.As a thriller it has plenty of twists and turns but you always fear that there is something predictable about it and in some instances poor scripting does not help.Affleck is a carjacker doing his time. His cell mate is in a relationship with a pen pal who he intends to hook up with after getting out but dies just two days before they are both release.Affleck takes over his cell-mate's identity, hooks up with the pen pal who turns out to be the gorgeous Charlize Theron and after some good sex has a run in with her brother (Gary Sinise) and his gang who want him to rob a casino in a reservation where the cell-mate once worked at.Of course no one believes him when he protests that he is not who he pretends to be and he has no option but rob the casino that he knows nothing about. As its Christmas, six Santas go in to rob the casino.The plot has a lot of standard thriller concepts and you always anticipate a few twists and turns even those relating to the dead cell mate's ultimate motives as to why he wanted Affleck to hook up with Theron.The film kind of looks cheap, it was mainly shot in Canada. It has some scenes that do not make sense such as the actual Casino heist where the security guards are all over the place and even Dennis Farina firing rather aimlessly and wasting bullets.Therefore you rely on the actors to carry the film off. Sinise and Theron are good enough to keep you watching. Affleck is average but his character does enough to be likable. However Affleck is really not a strong enough actor, even now he is an actor who has mastered his limited range and his future does lie in directing.However I wish this film would had been a better send off for the conspiracy meister Frankenheimer.

The one thing that may go against the movie is the absurd plot and even more absurd ending, but I was able to stay with the ridiculous twists and turns and embrace them for what they are. This movie is the thriller version of Bad Santa, so do not be expecting a feel-good holiday movie. In all, the movie was fun and explosive and it is a change of pace from recent holiday films. John Frankenheimer's film is about a man named Rudy who is about to be paroled from prison after serving a sentence for grand theft auto. His cellmate, Nick is also about to be paroled, and Nick tells Rudy of his love with his pen pal named Ashley. Due to an unfortunate accident, only Rudy is released from prison and decides to meet with Ashley. However, it goes downhill after Rudy is forced to go on a heist by Ashley's nefarious brother, Gabriel. The acting is not too bad. I have to admit that seeing Ben Affleck in the midst of such strong, overpowering men is laughable. But I think he manages to hold his own. Charlize Theron delivers a great performance as Ashley and she is not only beautiful, but she acts incredibly well. Gary Sinise is an excellent bad guy, although I feel like his character whimpered out as the movie progressed.Overall, Reindeer Games is entertaining enough as it is despite some incredibly ridiculous moments. There are some glaring plot holes, but it's Christmas(in the movie), so we shall all just be jolly. With such a premise, the film could have been better but luckily it's not too terrible.

He was working with a decent neo-noir script that is heavy on the complications, double crosses and predicaments. His touch showed in orchestrating action scenes so that they seemed realistic, not cartoonish, edited so that the action was clear, and with good setups.The movie featured the strong acting of Charlize Theron in a substantial part and the excellent acting of Gary Sinise. His skill shows in the way that he can yell, show anger and still make it seem very real and intimidating. Clarence Williams III had a notable supporting role. Dennis Farina has some comic relief. Ben Affleck was adequate, no more, and sometimes wobbly in even being adequate. The problem is partly in the part written into the script. He's just a little too self-deprecating, humorous, indecisive, hiding his cleverness and skills underneath. It makes it hard to identify with him. He doesn't give us a likable enough character with at least some glimmers of heroism. He seems too much like a college chap.I found this movie a cut above the standard action movie because of a deeper neo-noir script and generally better acting and direction. It was an enjoyable outing that I think will hold up on a second viewing.

He is at His best when he does not distract.

The early Love Scenes are unconvincing, as is the Plot of misidentification and nothing seems plausible as the Setup begins to unfold.This is not the Director's worst Movie, for that see (or don't) The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996). Highly removed from His best work, this is watchable, but the cleverness is clunky and there are too many things that just don't flow.

Granted there are no protagonists in the movie, it has become utterly monotonous as we are treated to an endless exhibition as the Hollywood clich√©d baddies are interrogating their foes at gunpoint as the disgruntled viewers watch as the easy task of pulling the gun trigger doesn't come off at the right time. Even though we don't like to see someone get killed on film, when they might be someone you admire, the credibility gets lost in the shuffle properly. The only time I ever accepted this flaw was the 1960's Batman series where the baddies shoot awkwardly and Batman and Robin find themselves in a silly situation and resourcefully managed to break out of it. By rights Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) should have been killed halfway through Reindeer Games' and I'm the last to judge whether he lives or dies, but when watching this film all I can say is DUH! Rudy is an ex-convict who's on the brink of parole and when he's discharged he will confront a young lady who will potentially rectify his life back in sync. These two are total strangers to one another. The only contact these two know each other from is through letters But there's a flawed twist behind this land of confusion. Rudy is coming off as a cell-mate who was killed in a prison rumble and this cell-mate was too meet this lady. Because his lust over women makes him tingle in delight, Rudy comes out of jail, he get more than what was expected from him. His new girlfriend, Ashley (Charlize Theron) has a brother who's a small-time #$%$ named Gabriel (Gary Sinese) who assigns Rudy to take down a casino. It was claimed that the cell-mate Rudy's posing as once ran a casino on a Native American reservation near Detroit, so Gabriel wants Rudy instructions of how the casino is set up, the security patterns and whatnot, anything that will make this heist a huge success. So Rudy, who's in a hole can only bluff his way out of the predicament because he's not the right person or the real person to pull it off.The film is full of holes it's enough to put Swiss cheese to shame. In one scene, Rudy tries to convince Gabriel that he's no the person who he really is and gives a hand-written letter to Gabriel to reveal if this is the right man. So why didn't Gabriel juxtapose the cell-mate's handwriting and Rudy's handwriting to see if this is the same person? Rudy could have reported this to the police, but see that he's being held by law breakers would violate his parole and he would be back in jail again. Some of the entanglements between the characters are quite hilarious and filled with unintended humour and the twists were jilted and contrived and it's hard to root for a leading character we don't really care about.Director John Frankenheimer uses his signature perplexity in making this movie. The real trouble here lies by utilizing his vision, he dismissed the flaws in Ehren Kruger's script. I can't believe that this script was written by the same person who wrote the much better thriller Arlington Road. His attempt to be different badly hurt Kruger's script. The proof comes from Rudy escaping from the casino as he gets caught in the wilderness. He seems savvy at hot-wiring cars, so he just randomly hijacks one and makes a run for it. How ironic! Plenty of well-known performers are given only one scene and really have no point or any kind of focus to what the story is about. Others are on a substantial amount of time and were not really needed in the end which is always annoying and maddening. John Frankenheimer put in other hackneyed films in the past like 52 Pickup amongst others and the results were an utter failure. He has potential to be really good, but finds himself lowering himself by making flops like Reindeer Gamesand knowing how long he's been in this business he should have known better.The more accurate title should be called Lamedeer Games.

The film's a little messy, a bit patchy, full of somewhat inconsistent characters and a little wavy in overall tone; but there's a sense of adventure about it, a feeling of energy &#x96; a sense that it wants to try and entertain you as it takes you on this rabid ride all across the snowy outback of Michigan, as deceit; terror and characters as cold as the setting it is in which they're based, rule the roost.Reindeer Games is somewhat more of an exercise in second unit direction and punchy, surprise reveals than intricate plotting and precise character progression. There are a number of individual sequences, in which very few is said but rather a lot is done, that keep the film on some kind of straight and narrow. For instance, a passage of the film sees the lead attempt to escape from the grip of those that have him when they leave him alone in a motel room for the night. The attention to the motel and its surrounding area, its car park in particular, as a space while this individual attempts to avoid certain characters and catch up with others is a wonderfully unfolded sequence. Additionally, the premise for the entire passage places its criminal lead, a rather bland Ben Affleck, in an escapist-driven scenario thus complimenting the actor's annoyingly consistent expression of being frightened, as he strains to get away. The film begins, somewhat needlessly, right nearer the end of the piece as an array of dead individuals in Santa Claus outfits lie strewn around a casino building. We're greeted by a certain Rudy Duncan, and it's Affleck's voice. Rudy's been in prison for a number of years and just wants to lay low as his time in jail nears completion, something that looks in jeopardy when a riot breaks out in the cafeteria and mostly everyone gets involved. His cell-mate and good friend Nick (Frain), is stabbed rather mortally, leaving a bitter taste as freedom beckons. Upon our lead leaving prison, we learn that friends and relatives of these hardened criminals just getting out stand patiently outside in the cold so that they may greet these now free head-cases with warm smiles and cuddles as if they were waiting at an airport terminal for them after a long flight. We also learn that, the best thing to do in order to honour his friend, Rudy reckons getting with the girl he's been exchanging letters with whilst behind bars for all this time might be a good idea.And what a girl. We're lead to believe that Charlize Theron's Ashley; being the reasonably pretty twenty-five year old, easy going girl that she is; needs to go so low as to write to prison inmates in order to find that special someone. Rudy's been studying Ashley for longer and in ways she's unaware. Beginning from the bottom of the photograph and working his way up whilst doing exercises, Rudy has gazed at the pictures Nick was sent of her, by her, from over the years. The notion of having to work strenuously, whilst directly under the eye of her in some sort of form, echoes what's to come. Now, with Nick supposedly knifed; dead and out of the picture and with Ashely completely in the dark as to what Nick's supposed to look like, an advantageous scenario beckons. Director John Frankenheimer, making his last film before his death in 2002, pays closer attention to their relationship and the basis of their relationship than he might otherwise have done. Going into the underlying theme of their bond would spoil too much, but suffice to say; it is to do with identity and who it is they say they are at first meeting.Following a montage in which Ashley and Rudy get to know one another, a cringe-worthy passage that looks like it belongs in the latest Christmas time released romantic-comedy than anything else, Gary Sinise and his leather-sporting tough guy baddies turn up, seeing mostly all of Hell breaking loose. Sinise's Gabriel and his cohorts know that Nick used to work at a local casino, thus they presume he knows all the ins and outs of the security and layout which would be perfect for a robbery &#x96; a robbery Gabriel and co. want to perform. The film enjoys exploring the relationships between these characters and the power play that comes with them. In most of the scenes, Rudy has to bluff as Nick so as to avoid being simply killed; with bluffing playing a prominent part in who exactly is aligned with whom. The film is peppered with some daft instances in which the lyrics from popular Christmas musical numbers act as dialogue, while other Christmas songs pop up as part of the soundtrack. Of the film's other raging inconsistencies is a scene in which the enemy must explain the entire plot to the lead as he thinks he's about to eliminate him; and a bloodied, dual Uzi sporting Dennis Farina doing his best to defend himself. Reindeer Games has few admirers, and while it has that ability to have you emit the odd groan, it's the pulpy material and consistently smirking execution of said material which keeps it alive. The film doesn't settle for mindless action, and most of the more intense scenes revolve around the explosions of emotion between characters as revelations and in vein bargaining play out. This isn't the best by most involved, but it suffices for what it takes on.

It's an overwritten script, with completely unnecessary twists and turns that tries to make the movie look more clever than it in fact really is. Instead it makes the movie a completely implausible one and the movie would had worked out much better if it was just a brainless simple action flick.Also sort of sad that director John Frankenheimer had to end his career with movies such as this. In the '60's he was a great director who made movies such as Birdman of Alcatraz, All Fall Down, The Manchurian Candidate and Grand Prix and in the '70's with movies such as French Connection II and Black Sunday. Yet he remains best known to the general public for the movies he did in his later career, of which this movie is one of them.Problem is really the movie its script. On the one hand it's a simple action movie script that's hanging together from its coincidence while on the other hand it tries to be a really clever one, involving around a 'criminal master plan', that however instead comes across as really stupid in the end.The movie also suffers from some poor casting choices. It has a great cast but yet not everyone feels like he's at the right place. I'm no Ben Affleck hater but this just wasn't the right role for him to play. He felt miscast, also since he often approached his character more in a comical way than in a serious action movie way, it seemed to me. Gary Sinise is a great actor but he doesn't really play a good and strong enough villain in this movie, also because of his crazy look perhaps. Other actors such as Dennis Farina really aren't given enough room in his movie to shine, which is a real wasted opportunity.It's not like this movie is the worst the genre currently has to offer but it's not exactly one of the best or most memorable movies either. It's still a movie that mildly entertains, or at least it's not a movie that ever really bores, so the movie still remains somewhat watchable when there really isn't anything better on TV or to rent for you.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"When I get in there you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane!","Date":"19 May 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" God, I love a good caper.

I was surprised I hadn't known about it longer, given its high profile stars in the lead roles. But having watching it, its easy to realise why it wasn't famous or anything above par. In fact, it's much worse than your average action flick. It doesn't start out very promising, but still has potential to be an enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, it continues on in a downward spiral into nonsense and reaches rock bottom long before the end. There are a few twists in the plot, but by the end they are just plain ridiculous and fall into every single plot-hole they come across. Of course there's the usual, `I-won't-kill-you-now, I'll-give-you-an-exotic-and-elaborate-death-that-never-works' clich√© along with countless others. The acting standard ranges from below average to laughably bad. Ben Affleck doesn't do much with his part as the typical hero. Whoever told Charlize Theron that she could act, should be shot. She overacts to the worst degree, hamming it up and being totally unconvincing. Gary Sinise received an Oscar nomination for his part in `Forrest Gump' but the director clearly didn't want him to act here. His villainous character is highly unmemorable and he's given very unconvincing long hair and facial hair.The thing that bothered me the most is the overlooking of small details. The film was poorly edited as at each camera angle for about two minutes at a time. Christmas music is played in the background to the most serious scenes and it simply doesn't cohere. The movie isn't to be taken seriously but in some scenes it attempts to, and the results are, er, pathetic. There's a brief scene in which we see a bunch of pictures, pitching Dennis Farina's supposedly famous character alongside Hollywood heavyweights like Cher and Robin Williams. We're not supposed to take much notice of them, but the trick-photography is extremely poor. This unique type of visual effects was done much better in `Forrest Gump' as more work went into it.As I said, the twists in the plot are a nice addition at first, but are overused to make them seem more and more ridiculous as each one comes and goes.

In this case he impersonates a fellow inmate to get it on with Charlize Theron once he's released, only to find himself forced into an armed robbery scheme with a crazed looking long-haired Gary Sinise.  Affleck is great; I was never a huge fan of his but he cracked me up with the way in which he kept pushing Sinise's buttons.  Sinise is way over the top and keeps coming with the nasty one-liners.  He enjoys a rather warped variation on dart-throwing for example.The Christmas setting makes things even funnier.  If you like stuff like Red Rock West, Fargo, Midnight Run and Con Air this could be up your alley.  Don't expect anything resembling great art or serious suspense here, but it is pretty snappy with the one-liners and a real hoot. "},{"Title":"Refried beans Games is more like it...

Don Siegel is one, Walter Hill another, and the late John Frankenheimer is a third. Frankenheimer quietly produced a very interesting and impressive body of work and didn't get a fraction of the attention he deserved. All I can say is thank God 'Reindeer Games' wasn't his final movie! It would be a tragedy if this garbage would be the film he went out on. It is an absolute stinker, no two ways about it. The basic problem is a third rate script by Hollywood hack Ehren Kruger, who is inexplicably taken seriously by many. This movie should have never been made. There's no way to salvage it. Not even with first rate supporting heavies like Gary Sinise, Danny Trejo, and Frankenheimer regular Clarence Williams III. Compare the latters scary performance in Frankenheimer's tough 80s thriller '52 Pick-Up' with this, and it's obvious that it is the script here that lets the actors down. Ben Affleck is a likeable performer and Charlize Theron is obviously extremely beautiful, but both are miscast, and basically unbelievable as the characters in the story presented. This is an awful movie with nothing to recommend it, and the ridiculous, sentimental ending is just one misguided moment in a movie chock full of them. Watch this at your peril.

Under either title, however, it doesn't match up to Lethal Weapon or Die Hard in the actioner-set-at-Christmas stakes... it's not even as suspenseful as The Night The Reindeer Died (the spoof TV movie trailed at the beginning of Scrooged).John Frankenheimer's direction and some good performers (Affleck, Sinise, Charlize Theron, Dennis Farina) are all at the mercy of Ehren Kruger's screenplay, which suffers from the need to not so much suspend disbelief as tie it to the end of the fishing line that kid in the DreamWorks logo drops and watch him haul it up to the moon. To be precise, apart from Affleck playing the beast with two backs with Theron at the first opportunity the movie has NO credible moments. It's supposed to be twisty, but it just gets more ridiculous as it unfolds; from the casting of Affleck as the least likely hard-bitten convict since Tom Selleck in An Innocent Man (which, interestingly enough, also came from a Disney division - in this case Touchstone as opposed to Miramax), through the disguises used to first case the casino that's the robbery target and later to rob it, to the climax which plays one card too many... as my older sister said, Affleck's Huh? look in the finale was probably on the faces of many people who saw this in cinemas.Yet Reindeer Games is still fun precisely because it's so wildly overcomplicated and idiotic; you wonder how on Earth they manage to get through it with a straight face. Admittedly Sinise (who perhaps should avoid making Disney-associated movies after Touchstone's Mission To Mars, Snake Eyes (co-produced by Paramount and Touchstone) and this) is wasted in a hammy role, and Theron - who usually manages to add a touch of decency to her projects (even The Astronaut's Wife) - is more reliant on her considerable sexiness than usual for most of the movie, and it's not overflowing with action, but it's certainly never boring.

This film, just like Fargo, opens with falling snow flakes, and a lot of the narrative drive consists of people being subject to misunderstandings or bad luck. The main character Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) is released from prison just before Christmas, but due to chance (and questionable morals) he is involved in a hopelessly ill-conceived and badly planned robbery masterminded by Gabriel (Gary Sinise), a long-haired Spinal Tap version of the hero from Apollo 13. Sinise is really funny, but seeing it I wasn't sure he was funny the way intended. His character is constantly undermined by ironic comments from his assistants, and some of the humor arises from him being so controlled and uptight, not entirely mastering the bad guy look while reloading his sawed-off shotgun. In spite of several tattoos and convict jargon, Affleck does in my view not escape his tendency to look like mother-in-law's favorite son. It's the same as if Hugh Grant should try to play ex-convict it just wouldn't  work. The film being of the Christmas variety, it seems the producers were almost as badly in need of money as the film's Gabriel, since they went ahead and released it in February, instead of waiting.

Really, really, dumb.  The direction alternates between gimmicky and trite; the script is tired and entirely predictable (despite the intended plot twists that are really only added layers of inanity); the acting is on autopilot.One sure sign that you're watching a cookie-cutter action film every time an automobile crashes, it explodes.  Another such sign the hero is armed with some ludicrously unconventional weapon at some point, and uses it to defeat a bad guy who has him hugely out-gunned (a side note on this point when I first saw the old squirt-flammable-liquid-on-the-villain-just-as-he's-lighting-a-tobacco-produ ct trick in Cape Fear, I was amused.  Now, having seen this ridiculous gimmick appear countless times in innumerable bad action flicks, I'm almost ready to curse the day man discovered fire).Now that we're living in the 21st century, I think it would be kind of action- and mystery-movie directors to acknowledge the fact that crime-scene investigators have been checking for fingerprints for the last hundred years or so.  When a convicted felon - whose fingerprints are automatically recorded - puts his hands on the steering wheel of a car that is later found burned out at the bottom of a hill, there's a very good chance that his fingerprints will be found and he will subsequently be identified by them. Likewise, when a convicted felon goes around generously putting stacks of stolen money in people's mailboxes in broad daylight, his fingerprints may very well give him away, if he isn't first spotted by his beneficiaries.Charlize Theron is funnier in this movie than she possibly could have intended to be - the way her eyes get squintier, her voice gets grainier and she takes on that overdone bad girl look and persona once her true motives are revealed; the way she kisses each of the men she kisses in a more lewd fashion than the last, until, ultimately, one could reasonably fear that she may bite James Frain's head off at the jaw.  Her topless scene is the only watchable moment in this film, and that's not worth anyone's rental dollar, since that scene will most certainly be available for free at myriad websites very soon, if it isn't already.

It also fails because its talented writer Ehren Kruger apparently forgot the meaning of the word excess.The story, about a convict who assumes the identity of his dead prison cell mate and becomes involved in a dangerous casino heist, seems like an interesting premise at first but never delivers.The movie opens promisingly enough (with the dead bodies of several men dressed in Santa Suits). In fact, the film is tolerable until the ending, at which point it becomes clear the only reason for the unnecessary twists are to keep the audience guessing over and over to the point of redundancy. Which is a shame because this movie certainly deserved better, considering some of the talent involved.The cast tries hard with the material but comes up short. Ben Affleck is certainly charismatic and capable of delivering a good performance but here isn't entirely satisfying. Although he has the smart aleck part down perfectly, he's not always believable as the ex-con. Similarly, Charlie Theron doesn't fare that well in her underdeveloped role. Even though Theron is a very beautiful and talented actress, she is  unfortunately saddled with the script's twists and turns. Gary Sinise's performance is by far the movie's most enjoyable aspect. Sinise, who is also faced with various script problems, manages to breathe some life into the proceedings with his scenery chewing villain. As a result the movie becomes somewhat fun.To the film's credit, director John Frankenheimer keeps the pace moving at a fast clip and there are a few decent action sequences.But the movie's biggest problem (the script)is most clearly seen during the ending, which piles on one ridiculous plot twist after another (with no clues or evidence to back them up, making them all the more ludicrous). Good twist endings force the viewer to carefully examine what has happened before and led up to the end. But the best twist endings are the ones where the viewer can not only examine the film but also discover clues and put them together on additional viewings. Here the twist ending is thrown in simply for the sake of having one. It seems as if writer Ehren Kruger felt the need to explain the character's motivations and actions in just a few sentences instead of allowing the audience to figure it out for themselves (like in RED ROCK WEST and BLOOD SIMPLE - 2 vastly superior thrillers). With REINDEER GAMES, viewers will be left confused and the movie doesn't even bother to explain one of the larger problems (which is surprising since it bothered to explain many other things which didn't really matter).Another problem is that the characters spend an endless amount of time explaining (and re-explaining) their actions to one another. They also aim their guns at each other and do even more talking when they should be shooting. This does nothing but remind the audience of the Talking Villain cliche found in the James Bond movies. At least those films didn't attempt to take themselves seriously at all, whereas this one does and ultimately fails because of it. Had it been played as a self parody, one would be able to enjoy the film far more, because like the Bonds it would be pure escapist fare with a tongue in cheek attitude.

There are good people in front of the camera Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise in particular.  Legendary John Frankenheimer directed.  What went wrong?  That question has an easy answer Ehren Kruger's script.  The film opens with a shot of a dead body dressed in a Santa Claus suit, crumpled on the hood of a car.  Four more shots, each of a different dead guy -- all Santas -- come next.  Doesn't that grab you?  Then we see the words, Six days before.  Before?  Right there the audience is given a clear warning, about a minute into the movie, that something's gone wrong already.  The story begins when an ex-con (Affleck) gets involved in the robbery of an Indian casino in Michigan.  The countless preposterous plot twists -- actually plot knots -- develop into a parade of implausibilities.  The casino never has many patrons.  Why would anyone want to rob a casino that doesn't do much business?  Because there are absolutely tons of money in the office.  Where did it come from?  The most dishonest proprietor on earth can't amass a mother lode if little cash is coming in.  At one point, the casino manager, beaten to a bloody pulp and clearly near death, abruptly leaps to his feet, grabs a gun and starts shooting in all directions.  On at least 10 occasions, one or another of the movie's slimy psychos aims a gun in Affleck's face and could easily blow him away.  Why doesn't that happen?  Each time Kruger ingeniously comes up with a preposterous way out.  Ben is also subjected to more kicks and beatings than even Sly or Arnold could survive.  Every organ in his body would be ruptured.  His face would be ground meat.  Nothing about him suggests the superhero, yet at the end he has a bruised cheek, a small scratch and a boy-next-door grin.  No aspect of this film makes a trace of sense.  The ultimate shocker -- the revelation of who's behind all this idiocy -- is explained away so lamely that it earns only a contemptuous snicker.  Scream 3 is another Kruger triumph.  Avoid Games and wait for Scream 62.  Maybe he'll have learned the plotting game by then.

Almost all of us have one or two or maybe a handful of actors and actresses that are our favorites. Anytime they come out with a project we're curious, sometimes to the extent that we go forth, as though in a trance, to the theater and to see what they've done, even if the critics, previews, and even friends and family try repeatedly to warn us away. I was likewise curious about Reindeer Games. Charlize Theron has been one of my favorites since I saw The Devil's Advocate, and when Reindeer Games opened early this year I figured that if Gary Sinise is in it, how bad could it be?I didn't have time to see it in theaters, but when my college offered it for free this semester on cable, I decided to tune in. Fortunately, about an hour and a half of my life were all it cost me. The above critics are all correct on their observations about plot holes, unlikely premise, silly twists, and 2nd rate dialogue. There are some bright spots. Fans of Charlize Theron (read males aged 13 through dead) are treated to watching her character change gears more often then a NASCAR driver trying to weave though lower Manhattan. Her character of Ashley goes from warm and inviting to helpless looking and frightened to ice hearted and displaying a mean streak. And yes she has one or two scenes without wardrobe.Also, fans of Ben Affleck (read females aged 13 through dead) get a right mix of fear, sarcasm, and looks of I- can't- believe- this- is- happening- to- me throughout the film.Unfortunately, we can't believe it's happening either. Gary Sinise's character tried so hard to be menacing, but he always seemed to be more clownish then anything else. Also the bad guys seem to hit the jackpot too many times in a row when they predict the hero's next tow or three or fifteen moves. With a crystal ball like that, they could have just dumped the whole casino heist and played Power-Ball for the rest of their days. It's usually not a good sign when the audience mumbles, Oh, come on! too many times during the flick. Still, for every oh, come on! there was a clever moment of ah-ha! and the twists, while contrived, had me grinning from ear to ear.I'd call Reindeer Games enjoyable so long as you don't take it as seriously as the movie takes itself.

Ehren Kruger is a screenwriter who is currently one of the hottest commodities on the market right now, but his work seems to rely on an approach that may have been successful in his initial efforts, but nearly leads to the self-destruction of Reindeer Games. His Arlington Road was a solid, underrated little thriller and contained a twist ending so jarring and effective that one could easily overlook how contrived it really was due to its reliance on one character predicting EXACTLY what another character would do. Scream 3 was another Kruger-penned script that contained a villain whose master plan hinged on their ability to predict the characters' actions. Alas, Kruger takes this approach to ludicrous lengths in Reindeer Games. The story may revolve around the robbery of a casino, but it soon becomes apparent that the villains would be better off just abandoning their task and making twice as much money by starting up their own psychic network.Not that the script's deficiencies make Reindeer Games unwatchable. Overall, the film is a fairly passable way to kill 100 minutes and would probably have come across better as a direct-to-video quickie. The entire project just seems rather lackluster, considering the talent involved, as the first-rate cast fails to rise above the material and John Frankenheimer's direction is unspectacular at best. The action fails to generate much in the way of excitement, due mainly to the contrived fashion through which much of it is set up (Ben Affleck's hero pours alcohol into a water pistol because he just KNOWS that the bad guy will stop to light up a cigarette before shooting him). Indeed, most of the fun comes from trying to pick apart the absurdities in Kruger's script.One of the liabilities of loading a story with many surprise twists is that they have to be adequately explained in order for them to make sense. Unfortunately, this has a negative effect on the film's pacing as the characters are constantly forced to stop and talk about the twist that has just occurred so that everything will hold together. Its reminiscent of the classic James Bond moment where the villain explains his grand scheme to the audience, except that it is repeated FIVE OR SIX TIMES throughout Reindeer Games. This all leads us to our twist ending, which like Kruger's previous works, relies on a psychic villain predicting exactly what the hero will do. However, it doesn't take much to realize that the villain's whole scheme is ridiculously convoluted and more trouble than it's worth, especially since the hero's participation is not exactly vital to its success. It does not evolve out of the logic of the plot or the characters. As stated in the opening paragraph, it is twist that exists for the sole purpose of being a twist. However, it is a twist that succeeds at giving yours truly a rather twisted viewpoint. While Reindeer Games is strictly a mediocre piece of work, it can still be fun viewing for those of us who love sitting back and poking fun at the lunacy of screenplays such as this. You know that's an activity that I find that hard to resist...

Although it seems that recently I seem to forget and watch it every other year.  Now this movie has come along and will fill the empty void of the years in between Christmas Vacation. And for those years when I'm feeling adventurous they'll make a good double feature.The movie starts out with our hero Rudy (Ben Affleck) finishing out his prison sentence for stealing cars. It's all very reminiscent to the Jerry Bruckheimer classic Con Air. His last two days of prison consist of him working out and hearing all about his cellmate Nick's (James Frain) girlfriend Ashley (Charlize Theron). At the last minute Nick ends up not getting released when Rudy does. Rudy sees Ashley waiting for Nick outside of the prison and decides to pretend to be Nick since she doesn't know what he looks like. Since he had read her letters he knows what to say giving Ashley no reason to doubt him. Setting up a what looks to be a romantic drama about mistaken identity.Just as we get used to that idea, it takes a big u-turn. As Rudy walks into their motel room he is surprised by Ashley's brother (Gary Sinise) and his gang of gunrunners who also think that he is really Nick and force him into robbing a casino with them. Good holiday fun.I suppose the character Rudy could have been played by a lot of people but Ben Affleck plays it perfectly. He has just the right amount of charisma, comic timing, sarcasm and fear. Gary Sinise is very good as usual playing his usual bad guy role. I especially liked the scene when he did his impression of Ben Affleck. The ending can be criticized as over the top and stupid.

It seems to fall into that category of films that doesn't make you feel cheated for spending your matinee bucks on it but it also will not leave a lasting impression either. I'm not really sure where the lacklustre film could have improved but I just know it could have.Charlize Theron was pretty good as the vacilating female that makes herself palpable to almost every male character in the film.  She is a beautiful woman and to make her femme fatale like in here was a good move by the producers.The direction is quite nice with many chase scenes that are handled well by veteran director Frankenhiemer.  Especially intriguing is the Santa Clause break in at the casino.  It is quite the sight and pretty original to see a robbery attempt with five or six Santas firing uzis and such.The script is okay as well but it lacks something and this brings me to the two most recognizable faces in the film.Gary Sinise and Ben Affleck are good.  They do what they can with what they are given but again, they are lacking something.  Sinise just doesn't come across as that menacing and his gang of thugs are given some sporadic dialogue that attempts humour with lines about marketing and such.  But it doesn't work completely.  I think someone like Shane Black or even Jim and John Thomas could have been asked to come in do some re-writes.  With films like Lethal Weapon, Predator and Die Hard to their credit, they could have handled this situation better than Krueger.And now we get to Affleck.  I admire him very much.  People think that him and Damon are overnight successes in Hollywood and that is just not true. Both guys were in many films with smaller roles and only after Good Will Hunting came out did they hit stardom.  But think of films like Chasing Amy, Mall Rats, School Ties, Courage Under Fire and Dazed and Confused.  These are films that have been released over the last decade and had bit roles for these guys.  And now that Affleck has arrived on the scene he seems as though he wants to do as many films as he can.  He has appeared in big budget films like Armageddon and this one and had bit roles in films like Shakespeare In Love and Boiler Room.  The man loves to act.  Reindeer Games is a good role for him but it is also one that doesn't utilize his assets completely.  Here is a guy that is quite tall and in pretty good shape.  I would like to see him take action a little more seriously.  Why not give him a role that has him as a bad-ass tough guy.  I would like to see him beat the snot out of somebody.  Reindeer Games scratches the surface of this premise but it leaves much to be desired.This is worth a rental one night.  It certainly isn't a bad film but it is one that perhaps could have been better with a few rewrites and with Affleck being able to play a tougher role.  Again, just my humble opinion of course.6 out of 10  Affleck has shown that he can do action, now let's see him explode and try a more simple role with him as the takenocrapfromanyone character!

I'm listening. Writer  I see Bruce Willis in the role-I think I can get him-see, there's this car thief who's about ready to get paroled. His best friend and cellmate, also due to be released, has this beautiful woman he's been writing to and bragging about.

Producer  They get out, she's just as beautiful as her pictures, but her boyfriend or brother or something is a criminal and she's set him up. Writer  Oh, you are good! Producer  They want their help to knock over this casino one of them worked at. Writer  You are amazing! ...and so on and so forth. From here the pitch leads to Who's gonna direct? Amazingly, on the 'available' list is John Frankenheimer! The writer is going balistic. John Frankenheimer? French Connection John Frankenheimer? Manchurian Candidate John Frankenheimer? Birdman of Alcatraz John Frankenheimer? The writer is given a mild sedative and told that Frankenheimer's luster has since worn off a bit and he'd now like to direct Con Air-like action movies. This takes the wind out of writer's sails, but he's still happy to have a legend's name on his movie.Mr. Frankenheimer's presence notwithstanding, you could do worse for a Saturday night video rental or second-run theater matinee than Reindeer Games. After all, it's got Gary Sinise (looking way too much like he just stepped off the set of the new 'Jesus' TV miniseries than I was comfortable with) doing his standard jittery overacting as the cuckoo leader of a bunch of gun runners who decide to start making some real money. It's got Charlize Theron, who I have to admit was perfectly cast here, though I've seen better work from her. Oh yeah, and there's Ben Affleck as Bruce Willis.The writer also attempts to give the characters, mainly Sinise's crew of thugs, a refreshing array of personalities. Nice try. This is one of many ways Reindeer Games is trying to be a different kind of action movie. There is precious little innovation here, though, and it all fizzles and amounts to not much at all.This is why I thought, as I watched a bunch of Santa suit-clad gunmen blow apart a casino on Christmas Eve (or maybe I should have prayed), let this be the end of it.

This guy already is beginning to have cult-like fan following and it seems that he's just getting started.  He's starred in 12 movies in the past 3 years and has 3 more slated for release this year alone.  Not only does he act, but he's one of those Hollywood, actors, producers, director's, etc.  With and Oscar and Golden Globe for writing Good Will Hunting and directing a movie called I Killed My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her on a Meat Hook, and Now I Have a Three-Picture Deal at Disney a couple of years earlier he is poising himself to become one the next film legends. Reindeer Games is one of those movies that no matter how good you think you are at figuring movies out, if you get the ending right you're just plain lucky.  It is also the kind where if you know the ending before you see it, a good part of the movie is ruined. Affleck adds another great performance to his resume.  It's kind of hard to see him in an die-hard honest-to-God action movie.  Typically these are left to likes of Arnold, Sly, and Bruce Willis.  John Frankenheimer helps out a little in this area, because unlike many action movies of late there isn't an exploding vehicle or AK-47 firing of every 40 seconds.  Don't get me wrong, there are explosions and automatic gunfire, but it's used more sparingly and adds to the story.  The effects, nudity, and macho-ness are not present just for the sake of being there. I think Affleck and Charlize Theron made a great duo.  Her career skyrocketed with The Devil's Advocate in 1997.  She plays her part superbly as well. Many will disagree with me on this part, but I think Gary Sinise is who mad this film good.  He  plays Gabriel, the moronic villain.  This guy is mean enough to shoot an ice fisherman while in his hut, but dumb enough to believe Rudy's lies.  Dumb and mean not the best combination.  Sinise pulls it off nicely.  I think he just one of those guys that can play a multitude of parts well. Reindeer Games is a great guy movie, and a good action-comedy.  It's not a chick-flick, but I don't see any reason everyone can't get some enjoyment from it.

In fact this is a polite way to say that I can't stand the guy. This time let me tell you; in other movies sure he was less worse! Here he's the human interpretation of blank. This movie is the conclusive proof for how he's having such a one of a kind DULL face and performance. The other factors were between this dull and even duller. Not much encouraged me to care about the movie. To tell you the truth it took me one half and 2 quarters of previous viewings before actually completing the whole thing. And when I did, I felt bad. (John Frankenheimer) didn't bring much to the story. Although there is a certain character for many shoots but slight, superficial and not interesting. (Affleck) himself said, in Inside The Actors Studio, that (Frankenheimer) left the cast do the scenes in the rehearsals the way they wanted to do, then he built the set and selected the angles of shooting according to it (!!). Most probably the man got desperate with a lead like this, so he did the least efforts to handle him (HENCE THAT WAS BECAUSE OF YOU MISTER !). (Gary Sinise) delivered nasty performance with nasty make-up. The sex was cheap. The action wasn't that available or done attractively. And I didn't buy entirely the end's twist. It gets so violent at the end's heist. So violent to an extent that convinces you how they wanted to compensate the shortcomings by increasing the gallons of blood. Hardly I'll tell you what I liked  it's the beauty of (Charlize Theron), some of the soundtrack (accurately the oldies, and the piece of music when the lead meets the girl for the first time), the last explosion, and the outrageously happy ending; it's something this movie got to be remembered by (but NOT re-watched for !). (Reindeer Games) is a B-crime movie with C-entertainment. It oozes silliness and annoyance. Maybe with another cast, things would have been more tolerable. In any case I don't think that (Frankenheimer) in his grave is fond of the idea that this movie was his swan song. Finally, 2 things of it nearly scarred me for life; the first is the way (Affleck) did some of the supposedly funny moments (OH MY GOD !), and secondly the way his face looked after exploding the car at the climax; check on the word blank in any encyclopedia, and you'll find a photo of his reaction from that scene beside it !

The pace was such with ample twists and turns, even if I could see a lot of things coming in the distance, and yet the storyline kept catching me off guard and kept me wondering. At least, that is, until the implausible twists at the end arrived. The direction however was skillful enough that this did not happen until the moment before the credits and my brain did not have time enough to process the erroneous data until the several seconds it took my chin to hit the floor and I was left feeling stunned. Unsure of exactly how, but with a definite feeling that I'd been tricked.This movie seemed to be made by a magician somehow and I wished I'd recorded it to watch at leisure as I do with all movies I plan to watch. But there's the rub you see I hadn't 'planned' to watch this movie, it simply came on one night and caught me off guard. And too it's credit and all those involved in it from the writer to the director to the ample acting talent this story had at it's disposal during all it's amazing twits, turns and machinations, it kept me glued to my seat in that wonderful 'late night' kinda way. Almost, dare I say, in a Hitchcockian embrace.So when the opportunity presented itself again years later I decided to record the beast and take a closer look at its claws, teeth and fleas. All I can say is I wish I hadn't because the slight of hand in the proverbial light of day wasn't so slight. I can only describe it like that moment in The Wizard of Oz when you get to see the impotent Wizard behind the curtain, or walking the overly sun bleached streets of Las Vegas the morning after the neon nights before or hearing those awful rumours about Santa, the Easter Bunny and all their friends. It was a sad sad moment, bitterly disappointing and something some part of me deeply wished I hadn't done. But there it was... the holes and cheap tricks lay exposed, the magicians hand had somehow slapped my face... the spell was broken! Alas, to watch this movie once in full flow as it would have been originally experienced by theatre goers is probably a six out of ten star pleasure. But dare to scratch the gilding anywhere at all a second time, especially the credibility of the plot, and the dream simply vanishes like a mirage before your very eyes.Suddenly those six stars turn into one or two. The writers can be seen to be taking extraordinary liberties, the direction now seems highly proficient but hurried and heavy handed, and the acting could keep a lumberjack busy for many years. What a great shame and to my regret I found I'd been watching a 'disposable' movie. Just like a tissue or a paper plate, used only once so to speak, its flimsy nature was exposed, ready to be thrown away, gone... never to be seen again!

While heavily-armed, trash-talking, macho males dominate this testosterone-soaked saga, Charlize Theron takes top acting honors as a manipulative, man-eating temptress.Scenarist Ehren Kruger, who penned Arlington Road and Scream 3, has written a lively but literate, tongue-in-check melodrama with about as many endings as the 1998 Denise Richards romp Wild Things with Matt Dillon.Auto thief Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck of Chasing Amy) and his cellmate, Nick (James Frain), have 48-hours left to serve in Michigan's austere Iron Mountain Prison. Rudy has grown weary of listening to Nick read him letters from a woman who has become his pen pal. No matter how often Rudy warns him about strange women, Nick plans to hook up with this dame after he gets out.Everything is going swell for them when a riot erupts in the prison cafeteria over a roach-infested gelatin dessert. A vengeful inmate, just out-of-solitary packing a grudge and a shiv for Rudy, tries to carve up our protagonist during the chaos, but Nick takes the knife for his friend and appears to die in his arms.As Rudy leave prison, he spots Ashley Mercer (sexy Charlize Theron of Monster), the girl Nick had worshipped in his letters, and decides to take advantage of her ignorance. Nick never sent her his photo, so Ashley believes Rudy when he takes over Nick's identity. Rudy enjoys a bang-up, one-night orgy until Ashley's low-life brother, Gabriel (Gary Sinise of Mission to Mars), a violent, unhinged, trucker who sells contraband guns, spoils their fun.No matter how much he protests that he isn't Nick, Rudy cannot convince Gabriel and his trigger-happy thugs that they have made a mistake. Ashley warns Rudy that her brother won't hesitate to kill him if he suspects treachery.Reluctantly, Rudy assures Gabriel that he is really Nick, only to learn that Gabriel wants to knock over the casino where Nick worked before he went up to serve time. Meanwhile, former Las Vegas casino operator Jack Bangs (Dennis Farina of Manhunter) is having trouble attracting gamblers to the Tomahawk, a casino owned by an Indian tribe. Gabriel plans the robbery for Christmas day, with Rudy providing crucial details about the guards, alarms, and security precautions.Legendary director John Frankenheimer, who helmed Ronin, Seconds, and The Manchurian Candidate, never lets the action bog down in this nimble-minded thriller. Great action movies paint their heroes into a corner and try to bring the house down on them. Reindeer Games, a first-rate, four-star action opus, piles on the pressure and never gives its wily protagonist a break until fade-out. Outside of his work with Kevin Smith, this ranks as Ben Affleck's best work.

Even in its parts, this film adds up to very little - or even worse - and in its whole is left in the same category. A few dollars here, a few dollars there, and everyone is happy except the intelligent viewer who has paid his bucks/yen/euros/pounds or whatever seeing this or hiring this ridiculous charade.I cannot help thinking that there are too many bamboozlers and tricksters embezzled into the ingenuous and senseless Hollywood razzmatazz, such that if Ms. Theron goes back to South Africa, nobody will miss her, and if she comes to Europe she might just make a name for herself - worthy or not depends on her and her luck.In this case, luck ran out, as much for Ms. Theron as for Affleck and Frankenheimer, as well as practically anybody else connected with this mess of a film that had nothing to say.It is one of the best films representing Hollywood's brainless, mindless, twaddle.Ah, now I understand why Bush is still president..........how silly of me.

At some point during any given action movie, the audience will be asked to accept that the meek, mild-mannered accountant trapped in an elevator is really a former Green Beret demolitions specialist . . . or that a blonde stripper is fluent in six languages and can crack government computer codes . . . or that no matter how complicated a nuclear device may be, cutting the red wire will always successfully disarm such a weapon. It's part of the action movie territory. In most cases, the action movie rises above its implausibilities and moves forward into a realm of snappy one-liners and wicked, cool-looking violence that serves to entertain.Unfortunately, `Reindeer Games' is not one of those action films. Without wandering over into spoiler territory . . . let's just say that `Reindeer Games' is crippled from the very start by a vastly implausible concept that is so utterly massive, it nearly boggles the human mind. This concept is not only wildly unbelievable (and stupid), but it unfortunately also happens to be the lynchpin of the film. Each and every decision made by each and every character in `Reindeer Games' is based in some way, shape, or form upon this fatally flawed concept. As such, it's hard to believe anything that the characters do in the film, simply because their decisions are based entirely on some seriously bad ideas.  No normal or sane person would accept the things that all the characters in the movie so blindly accept at face value. . . so it's hard to even remotely connect with the events of the film. Even worse &#150; about halfway during `Reindeer Games', a glimmer of hope can be seen, as if some of the characters have some hidden motives that may help explain their idiotic acceptance of the main, flawed premise of the film . .. wrong.  The first flawed premise, in a supposedly surprising twist, is replaced by an equally awful and flawed premise, making the film no better than it was before.  Accepting flawed and often ludicrous ideas in an action movie is part of the action movie experience, but when the audience is not only asked to accept these hideously bad ideas throughout the entire film, but are bludgeoned over the head with them, as they most certainly are with `Reindeer Games' . . . it adds up to a bad, bad movie.For those of you still vaguely interested in seeing `Reindeer Games', here's the supposed plot Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck), a former car thief just released from prison, decides to impersonate his former cellmate Nick (James Frain) so that he can meet a beautiful woman named Ashley (Charlize Theron), whom Nick had been communicating with via a `prison pen pal' program. `Nick' and Ashley hit everything off just fine, until Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) shows up &#150; turns out he's a gun smuggler looking to pull a heist at a nearby casino that he knows `Nick' used to work at as a security guard.  Unable to successfully convince either Gabriel or Ashley that he's not really `Nick', Rudy is forced to become part of a major robbery &#150; and has to find a way out for himself and his new love Ashley before big brother Gabriel decides to `take care' of `Nick' with his semi-automatic assault rifle . . . .The cast of `Reindeer Games' is pretty good, but even an outstanding cast wouldn't have been able to save this heavily flawed film.  Ben Affleck is very good as the reluctant hero Rudy; Gary Sinise is a lot of fun as the scenery-chewing Gabriel; and the lovely Charlize Theron, who seems to be sleepwalking through the first half of the film, actually seems to wake up and redeem herself with some nice stuff in the second half.  The actors provide some neat little moments &#150; watch for Affleck's `Pecan Pie Diner' scene, it's excellent &#150; but none of these moments even come close to overcoming the film's very significant flaws.  What might've been able to save the film from its flaws is some heavy-duty, jaw-dropping action . . . and that action never materializes.  Not once.  Oh sure, there's action, but it's very bland and generic, nothing that hasn't already been done in a thousand other action films.  Even without the implausible concepts that mortally wound `Reindeer Games' from the very start . . . the film would've been average at best.  Throw the amazingly dumb and implausible concepts on top of this average film, and what's left is a disappointing, frustrating, and bland excuse for an action film.Decent characters, very weak action, and an incredibly stupid plot &#150; that's the best way to sum up `Reindeer Games'.  This is the sort of action film that should be collecting a lot of dust on the shelf of your local video store.  It provides one or two brief, decent moments . . . but that's it. Overall, not a very good action film at all.

It is fun to watch, it has a good story, it's entertaining, and even most of the acting is respectable enough. However, as a whole, the film is pretty weak. Ben Affleck is a car thief who is serving a six year sentence in prison. His cell-mate is a man named Nick Cassidy (James Frain), who seems to have met a beautiful woman named Ashley (Charlize Therun) in some sort of prison pen pal system. Rudy and Nick are scheduled to be released on the same day, but Nick has a run-in with a convict and winds up getting killed. Upon his release, Rudy has the bright idea to pose as Nick Cassidy so that he can get, uh, better acquainted with this Ashley girl that he has been hearing about for so long. Unfortunately, her truck driver/amatuer criminal older brother has found out from his letters to her that he previously worked in a casino, and he and his gang want Nick's help (whether he's willing to help or not) to rob that casino. Unable to prove that he's not Nick Cassidy and unaware of the design of the inside of the casino, Rudy is then faced with the challenge of successfully robbing this place so that the gang doesn't kill him, while at the same time avoiding getting caught so that he doesn't go back to jail for the rest of his life.The story is good. The huge holes (why would someone as beautiful as Ashley turn to a prison pen pal system to look for dates?!) are covered up pretty well by the time the film ends, and luckily the acting, for the most part, makes up for the crudeness of the script. The plot is derived from Quentin Tarantino's trademark of showing the end of the story at the beginning of the film. This is always an interesting thing to see, especially in a film like this. However, probably the most disturbing thing about Reindeer Games is the extensive and inexplicable use of blue screens and deep focus photography. There were a lot of shots that showed a face or a gun or something close to the camera, and everything else in the shot, everything that is far away from the camera, is also in focus. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it is unnatural, and it calls attention to the fact that there is a movie camera right there. Filmmaking is one of the few professions where invisibility is a goal for success, and while this deliberate violation of that rule is not necessarily prohibited, it should only be committed with good reason. There were scenes in Reindeer Games where I couldn't figure out why deep focus photography and especially blue screens were needed. Despite all of that, however, it did give the film a very distinctive look.Despite the film's numerous shortcomings, Reindeer Games is a fairly well-made crime thriller. I've seen Gary Sinise look better in other films (see every other film he's ever been in except Mission to Mars), and Charlize is not entirely convincing at times, although she did deliver a satisfactory performance, all told. And most of all, if you like plot twists, check this one out, because there are plenty.

But, I'm sure that this film is well placed, and paced, and oddly fun. Very electrifying (especially the first time around) story involves a prison inmate named Rudy (played good by Ben Affleck) who leaves after a fellow inmate dies. But he also takes his place and meets a girl (Charlize Theron who shows skin for the first time in 3 years) who unfortunately has a brother (so called) who needs Rudy to break into a Indian casino. Very twisting plot (more spoilers here than in The Empire Strikes Back) and great action make this a must see.Very cool, sometimes funny, with cameos by Isaac Hayes and Ron Jeremy as inmates.

Ben and Charlize are awful at acting and they really dragged this film through the mud. Keep on trying guys, since it seems there is a big audience for bad movies.

It could be excusable as a low-budget independent or a made-for-tv flick, but not a multi-million dollar production.A writer could have taken the initial premise of an ex-con assuming his cellmate's identity on the outside and run in a thousand different (and more interesting) directions. Instead we get a cheesy good guy/bad guy storyline and cardboard characters.I'm at the 1 hour mark and I won't bother with the rest of the movie. I stopped caring after 5 minutes.Horrible script, acting and production values. What else is left?The DVD cover is real nice -- end of story. Another waste of money!1 out of 10 only because there isn't a zero.

I do not like movies for nudity, violence, or swearing. I watch them for the story and acting. Do not get me wrong, I WOULD take an action movie any day. But the fact is I don't sit through silly movies to see that. Reindeer Games starts off with a great setting in a prison. I recall seeing the ending, and it was so powerful I HAD to see it again. Some would call it corny, but you know. This movie gives the viewers a hell of a ride. Ben's best role, and my favorite Frankenheimer movie. Solid.7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Ben Affleck is an All American Trademark","Date":"21 July 2005","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Ben Affleck is an All American Trademark. Any film with a big box-office and critically acclaimed star as him can never go wrong. I have seen all his films and all were some of the best I have ever seen. Reindeer Game was no exception. Director Frankenheimer shot this film in the heartlands where people treat each other with respect and keep their eye on the ball. Great scenery, great action, great cast and a plot to twist your head around, but what makes this action, who don it? Cat and mouse thriller such a great film is Hollywood No.1 super mega star Ben Affleck with his stunning good looks, charisma and acting abilities beyond any Hollywood actor. With this film I would consider Affleck to be a far greater actor them Sir Anthony Hopkins or Tom Cruise.Affleck's real love for pecan pie is also presented in this film witch I would consider a master mind play form Affleck/ Frankenheimer &#150; giving Affleck's character, Rudy, something real form Ben's life making the character more believable.

B.A. is nice and i'm sure that he is very professional, but the acting? Same background and results of Guynneth Paltrow. Maybe on the next year he could catch an Oscar.

Basically Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) is in prison serving a six year charge for grand theft auto, his cell mate is Nick Cassidy (True Blood's James Frain) who has served a two year sentence on a separate charge. Rudy and Nick are six days away from release, Nick has been corresponding with a young gorgeous woman named Ashley Mercer (Charlize Theron), he has her photographs all over his wall, he has never met her but cannot wait to meet her upon release, when she will be waiting for him, Rudy plans to reunite with his family when he gets out. However when a fight breaks out in the prison canteen, Nick is stabbed by another prisoner and dies, Rudy is released the following day, he sees Ashley waiting for Nick outside, he decides to take Nick's identity, and they end getting romantically close. Then gang leader and Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) storms in, he and his gang want Nick to help them pull off a robbery at the Indian casino he used to work in as a security guard, Rudy initially tries to convince the gang that he is not Nick Cassidy, but Ashley urges him to go with the ruse, or they'll both be killed. Rudy is furious with Ashley, he tries at first anything he can to escape the gang and their scheme, but remembering all the stories that Nick told him while they were in the cell together, he is able to devise a robbery. On the night of the robbery, Christmas Eve, Rudy breaks out of his holding to attempt arm himself and get away, but he stumbles on Gabriel and Ashley in conversation, they are not brother and sister, in fact they are lovers and partners in crime. The group enter the casino, dressed in Santa Claus outfits, Rudy hides the fact that he knows Ashley's secret and becomes part of the robbery, the large amounts of money are found, but when Gabriel takes Rudy to the manager, Jack Bangs (Dennis Farina), he confirms that he is not Nick Cassidy, Rudy confesses. Gabriel is furious by Rudy's deception, the manager opens a safe hidden behind the drinks cabinet that is supposed to be full of further fortune, but Bangs takes out guns from inside, killing a gang member, while the others flee, Rudy kills another of the robbers, before being grabbed by Gabriel and Ashley. They plan to drive Rudy off the cliff in a burning car, with some of the cash for the officials to see, during the argument Ashley accidentally reveals too much information, she shoots the suspicious Gabriel, shortly after, Nick appears! He reveals he faked his death, Ashley's real name is Millie Bobeck, and they had collaborated to rob the casino with Rudy and Gabriel's gang, Nick knew Rudy would go along with the ruse because of his secret feelings for Ashley, who had known all along of his true identity, it was all a set-up. Rudy cuts his bindings with a knife he got earlier, hot wires the car, crushes Nick reversing, he rams the fiery car into Ashley and jumps out before it goes over the cliff, Nick still alive tries to convince Rudy to share the money, but Rudy locks him in the truck and sends it over the cliff, in the end Rudy takes the bags of stolen cash, dispensing piles of money in mailboxes, and he returns to his family for Christmas dinner. Also starring The Butler's Clarence Williams III as Merlin, Gotham's Donal Logue as Pug, Danny Trejo as Jumpy, Isaac Hayes as Zook, Dana Stubblefield as The Alamo, Ashton Kutcher as College Kid and porn star Ron Jeremy as Prisoner. Affleck is likable playing the ex-con forced into a robbery, Theron is good as the beauty with a hidden agenda, Sinise always manages to pull off being sinister and menacing, and it is cool to see other recognisable faces in amongst the supporting cast. The film is full of standard but effective twists and turns, what starts as a simple case of mistaken identity turns into an essentially improvised heist, but then you find out it is not just the ex-con who is lying, the con becomes the conned, with the right amount of humour, tense moments and violence this is overall a fun and entertaining thriller. Good! "}]
