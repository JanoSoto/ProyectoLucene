It can be uplifting, complex, nuanced, unexpected and fresh.A small town in England hosts the National Hairdressing Championships, (Do you really think they have one?) and nobody seems too excited about it except a few ruthless competitors to whom winning means absolutely everything. Local boy Alan Rickman, a has been hair wizard now doing short back and sides for 7.50 is convinced to enter the competition by his son, his ex-wife and her girlfriend.Natasha Richardson (daughter of the incomparable Vanessa Redgrave) is brilliant as the terminally ill lesbian mother trying to use the event as a way to reunite her family. Her comedy and her pathos are equally moving, and her beauty isn't spoiled by chemotherapy-induced hair loss. Rachel Griffiths, whom you may remember from the hilarious Australian comedy Muriel's Wedding, is the model who left Rickman for his wife on the eve of his triumph in hairdressing, hence his present low state. Either of these ladies could have carried the movie. To have both of them is a treat of excess.Rickman is more believable as a barber than a high style hairdresser. Still, he pulls it off because he's Rickman. Much has been made of Josh Hartnett and his murderous accent. In reality, it's hardly noticeable. Get over it.Bill Nighy is fantastic as the unscrupulous London artiste pulling out all the stops to win the Championship for an unprecedented third time, using his daughter, the insanely beautiful Rachel Leigh Cook, as his model. Rosemary Harris, the perfectly cast Aunt Mae of Spider-man fame, is powerful as the elderly Daisy, confidante and model for Richardson and her team.The unseen treasure of this movie, and the genius behind it, is writer Simon Beaufoy. Beaufoy grew up in Keighley, the setting of Blow Dry. Until more recently he was probably best known for also writing the hilarious and inspired The Full Monty. As he developed as a writer, he later gave us the Oscar nominated 127 Hours, and Oscar winning Slumdog Millionaire.There is a scene, at the very end, when Rickman reveals his ultimate creation, that has to be seen to be believed. I still gasp every time I see it, and it reinforces for me a notion of beauty that transcends everything from age to gender. And don't miss the end credit sequence. It's hilarious.Too many movie viewers think being cynical makes them appear more intelligent or more profound, so they slam gems like this for their lighthearted humor. Nonsense. This is a funny 10 out of 10, and if you don't own it, log off right now and go get it. You won't be sorry.

As so often before the British are the strongest in character building, with every role filled with good actors and every detail and dialog driven to perfection.  You might say that the story line is predictable, not to mention if you see the making of beforehand, which more or less tells you every detail of the story!  Blow dry is one of these beautiful films that make you laugh and cry at the same time.  You disappear into the film, becoming one with the characters and their lives.

The wonderful Alan Rickman plays Phil, the deserted and disappointed husband of Shelley, played poignantly by Natasha Richardson. Phil owns a small barber's shop in the Yorkshire town of Keighley, but in the past he has been a champion in UK hairdressing.  However, life's traumas have reduced him to giving up any thought of ambitions on the public hairdressing stage.  When former rival hairdresser Raymond, (Bill Nighy) arrives in Phil's home town for the national hairdressing championships the scene is set for a dramatic confrontation and by the end of the competition many people's lives have altered.  Warren Clarke gives a bravura performance as the town's mayor, who gradually metamorphoses from a boring local official to an ever more ebullient show host.  The requisite romance is provided with a touch of the Romeo-and-Juliets.  This will probably be considered a `woman's film' but every hairdresser in Britain of either sex will want to see it.  Overall, although the progression of the plot is fairly predictable, if you can leave your critical faculties at home for the evening it could be an enjoyable fairy story.

What is most poignant is that it depicts a town that is disappearing in England. Films like this are social documents. If people don't act like this, then this is how we would like to have historians of the future remember us.It's nice to have films about people and places that are not normally considered glamorous. It's funny, thoughtful and a gentle story. No violence, no car chases, no sex. A bit of swearing, but that's part of normal language nowadays.I loved the comp√®re moving from his mayoral robes to night club glitter jacket through the competition. I loved the young ones falling in love. I loved the closure on the separation.I'm sure some cinematographer could have done more with the visuals of the hair cutting but this was a narrative film. It had a story, and I will add it to my collection of British movies. "},{"Title":"A Cut Above","Date":"21 February 2006","Score":"16 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Kieghley is a small Yorkshire village far from the fumes of the tour bus. Mayor Tony, overjoyed by his town's choice as host for the Year 2000 British Hairdressing Championship, announces this grand coup to a lukewarm response by the small group of townsfolk who bother to show up for his meeting. Young Brian Allen(Josh Hartnett), however, is very excited. Full of expectations, he approaches his father, Phil Allen(Alan Rickman), proprietor of the local barber shop where Brian works as well. Brian's reminder to his dad that Phil has already twice won this championship is met with a low growl of parental hostility. Phil flatly refuses to discuss it, much less enter. Blocks away, Shelley Allen(Natasha Richardson), walks the short distance to the local hospital for her doctor's appointment. Here, quite unexpectedly, this light little film delivers a heart punch. Watch Richardson's beautiful performance as the doctor reveals the cancer she's been battling is back. As he begins dispassionately discussing her treatment options, she forces him to make it personal by completing his speech with brutally honest cynicism (Your last two treatments have failed, so its probably trying to tell you summit there...). He urges her to consider another round of chemotherapy, but they both know she won't go through it again.Richardson perfectly captures the dignity, and agony, of a bright, intelligent woman who, facing the fact she is dying, decides not to pursue a hopeless situation. Her exchange with Daisy(Rosemary Harris), a terminally ill inpatient at the hospital, is acerbically poignant. You get the sense that she's suspected this for quite some time, and now it's time to prepare to leave this life, and set her affairs in order. To Shelley, the British Hairdressing Championship seems an ideal way to reconcile many old wrongs. An accomplished hairdresser, she owns the local beauty shop, living upstairs with her partner Sandra. Ten years before, she and husband Phil had competed for their third championship title with Sandra as their model. On the eve of competition, she and Sandra left Phil to enter into their lesbian relationship. Phil never forgave either one of them. Although just blocks from one another, he hasn't spoken to her, or Sandra, for years. Brian remained with his father after the breakup, and Shelley's relationship with him is, at best, awkward and strained.Now, however, she desperately wants to change all that while there is still time. She wants the old team back together again for one last go. But how? Brian likes the idea but turns her down. He has issues with his mum. Sandra thinks the whole thing is mad, and hates Phil as much as he hates her. Phil wants no part of it whatsoever. His sense of betrayal and deeply abiding hurt are palpable. It seems impossible. Resolute, she enters her salon, A Cut Above, into the competition anyway, to the delight of Mayor Tony, who hypes the entry in an effort to foster local interest. The contestants arrive with their glittering entourages. These include the infamous Raymond Robertson(Bill Nighy), with his unscrupulous assistant, Louis (Hugh Bonneville), and his daughter Christina(Rachel Leigh Cook), over from America on holiday.The hotel is full, and Robertson is forced to lodge with a local sheep farmer. David Bradley (Argus Filch of Harry Potter) is terrific as Noah, the dour farmer. He doesn't say much, but shows his sense of humor over his dead relative's hairstyle and sympathy towards Christina for having a git like Ray as her father. Bill Nighy as Raymond Robertson is excellent. Arrogant, ruthlessly competitive, nothing is as important as victory, including his daughter. Prior to the start of competition, he simply cannot resist the temptation to visit Phil's shop and gloat over the fall from grace of his former rival. The meeting sparks a heated confrontation between Brian, who witnessed the exchange, and his father. Angry at Phil's handling of the situation and his refusal to enter and show Ray up, Brian defies Phil and informs Shelley he will cut for her in the championship. Although pleased, Shelley knows they still really don't stand a chance in the final part, The Total Look, without Phil. Although his legendary signature event, Phil adamantly wants no part of it.That's enough synopsis to be going on with, I think. Watch especially the subplots. Mayor Tony's hilarious transformation from pompous small town official into glittering event presenter. The rally of the townsfolk behind their local team. Brian's funeral fiasco. Christina's Technicolor sheep. The amazing Daisy in Evening Hair. Sandra and Phil in a bathtub on a hill. Rachel Griffiths performance as Shelley's lesbian lover Sandra is rich with detailed emotion. Her unresolved conflict with Phil, her insecurity at being only the f*cking girlfriend, her reaction to the awful reality that the person she loves beyond reason is truly dying. And, gloriously, her radiant Total Look, which has to be seen to be appreciated. Well. A little more in depth than I had planned, but that's the overall feeling you get from Blow Dry. More than expected. More than planned. It works on so many levels. The lighthearted silliness of the British Hairdressing Competition, of all things. The reunion of two childhood friends, Brian and Christina, who rediscover each other as attractive adults of the opposite sex. The study of a man who must come to terms with the lesbian lifestyle of his wife, whom, deep inside, he still loves. And the moving portrait, throughout it all, of a dying woman's last attempt to recapture former glory and engineer the reconciliation of all those whom she most loves.Buy this film. Treasure it. And, when somebody asks you how you felt after you've watched it, you can honestly turn to them and say Never better, love, never better.

Alan Rickman is good, sincere and has depth, Josh Hartnett has an okay delivery ruined by his trying-too-hard faux Yorkshire accent, and Bill Nighy is Bill Nighy, you'll always get a few laughs from him, but the real stars are Rachel Griffiths and Natasha Richardson. Griffiths, in particular, is splendid, going from funny to poignantly hurt to deep, deep love without skipping a beat.

Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable romp, with some affecting performances. There is nothing revelatory or even unpredictable about the story, but it works nicely and certainly entertains. The film does have a few rich moments, but seems mostly a vehicle for a group of talented actors (and it is a highly pedigreed bunch here) to take decent material and put out a fun and sometimes very moving film.While it may drag a little in the center, don't give up watching for the finale and Rachel Griffiths total look finish that is about as outrageous and breathtaking a total look as one can possibly imagine. The normally brilliant Alan Rickman here sometimes feels just a little bit on autopilot, American Josh Hartnett is vastly underused, but surprisingly effective in an important role and Natasha Richardson, as ever, positively glows on the screen and raises the emotional and dramatic stakes to a level that makes the whole affair worthwhile.Not great?

I mean, how interesting could a movie about the British Hair Dressing Championships be, anyway? In fact, what I found was a quite funny movie with enough human interest thrown in to make it a worthwhile movie.The story revolves around a hair dressing family who have been broken apart when Shelly (Natasha Richardson) leaves Phil (Alan Rickman) for Sandra (Rachel Griffiths). Son Brian (Josh Hartnett) stays with dad Phil and works in a barber shop with his dad - quite a step down for Phil, who used to be one of the best British hair dressers. The family is brought back together when the Hair Dressing Championships come to their home town, and Phil, Shelley, Sandra and Brian pool their resources to beat their rivals.It's all quite well done, and the hair styles are - well - unbelievable in some cases. But there's also the backdrop of Sandra's illness that she's hiding from her lover Shelley.

And budding love.","Date":"17 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" At home on Netflix streaming movies.I searched out this movie upon hearing of Alan Rickman's recent death. He has always been one of my favorites and I had not seen this one yet.In typical British movie comedy style they take a silly premise, a British hair-dressing competition in the small town of Keighley, and build a story around it. Interestingly it also features two American actors the cast.Alan Rickman is Phil Allen who runs a hair-cutting shop with his son, Josh Hartnett as Brian Allen. It seems some years earlier, about 10 years, his wife, Natasha Richardson (also now deceased much too young) as Shelley Allen, left them to be with her lesbian girlfriend, Rachel Griffiths as Sandra, and they run a shop together. Their story is complicated by Shelly being treated for cancer.The issue comes up that for either group to have a chance in the competition for their small town to compete they must figure out a way to work together. Phil has not spoken to either of them since the split, he is still bitter but the son seems more willing to forgive and move on.Then pretty, 20-ish Rachael Leigh Cook (another of my personal favorites) shows up as Christina Robertson, daughter of one of the men competing in the event. She lives in the USA with her mother but Brian remembers her from when they were very young and it seems he had a secret hope she would someday return. From that stems the budding love.This is a fun movie which has some serious messages embedded, anyone who like the British style of humor should like this movie.

Ray is using his daughter as his model; Phil's model was once Sandra -- can they mend their rift and help Shelly through her last days? Funny, moving, and well-acted, Blow Dry is clever, fresh, and entertaining.

She needed to have been given more prodding from the director to bring her true acting talents out (her hair is also atrocious for a movie supposedly about hair). Cook often has great chemistry with actors, but her relationship with Hartnett falls a bit flat. The other actors (especially Natasha Richardson) do extremely well. The plot is wonderfully simple. The competition arch is played out very well without feeling as though we have seen this before.

The whole movie revolves around a national hair cutting championship and Shelly, Sandra (Griffths), Phil (Rickman) and Brian (Hartnett) must all work together to with the coveted golden scissors.Fortunately the different uses of hair proved rather intruiging rather than comedic as hoped, but still held up the movie, and little snide comments from Phil (Alan Rickman), made the movie all the worth watching.

They seemed  totally out of place in the small British setting, with some over the top British accents pouring out of Josh's mouth. It also seemed that Rachael's character was actually void of character and was only placed in the movie to look cute and pout every now and again, and bungle up most things that come before her.

"}{"Title":"The Rocky Hairdo Picture Show","Date":"10 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Think of it as Rocky - only this time the underdog dons a pair of clippers in lieu of boxing gloves.Blow Dry tells the story of family of hairstylists and how their lives become entangled (no pun intended) with cheesy-pink-haired corpses, rainbow-colored sheep, and an array of bizarre but dazzling 'do's and campy fashion when the British National Hair Championships descend upon their small, unsuspecting working-class Yorkshire town of Keighley.  At the heart of this dramedy is Phil (Rickman), the local barber who is ambivalent about a reunion with his estranged wife, Shelley (Richardson) in an effort to ditch a scheming nemesis and take a stab at the prestigious Silver Scissors trophy.  See, Phil and Shelley's history is as interwoven as a spiral or piggyback perm.  Ten years ago, Shelly ran off with his model, Sandra (superbly played by Griffiths) and left him to raise their son, Brian (Hartnett).  To add even more ammonium thioglocolate to the perm solution, Shelley is now dying of cancer and wants nothing more that to use the contest as a means to make amends with her ex-husband and son.Contrived plot aside, the result is a bittersweet blend of comedy and drama, heavier on the comedy, which stylishly illustrates the importance of family-no matter how unconventional.  The comedy is superb, as is the cast. Quite appealing in their supporting roles are Hugh Bonneville, as a flamboyant sidekick and famous runway model, Heidi Klum, as a kinky, two-timing siren.  They both display a light, comic touch in the some of film's most winning moments.   The story climaxes at the Total Look portion of the competition, where the creative genius of Academy-award winner for Elizabeth, Jenny Shilcore 's hairstyles and makeup provide a unique feast for the eyes.For those aficionados who can't get enough of hairstylists' inherent charm, last year's An Everlasting Piece and The Big Tease offer a laugh or two. In my opinion, with a stellar cast and all its heart and humor, Blow Dry is certainly a cut above the rest.

An excellent ensemble cast features a rather subdued Alan Rickman, a deliciously arch Bill Nighy, wonderfully incompetent Warren Clarke and a very perceptive Natasha Richardson.  There are faults with the writing - it's a bit uneven in places - and Josh Hartnett as Brian seems to have a real struggle with his supposed Yorkshire accent, but the end result is something quintessentially British that reads like an episode of 'Last of the Summer Wine'.  It has mordant Yorkshire wit combined with camp gay humour, an odd combination which for some strange reason actually works.If the plot developments are not exactly unexpected and the relationship between the young lovers seems rather superfluous, these are minor faults. It's not an excellent, first-rank movie - not quite up to the standard of 'The Full Monty' with which it has been compared - just good, solid fun.  I particularly relished Bill Nighy's 'queen of the hairdressers' dumped unceremoniously in the wilds of Yorkshire like a slightly camp Withnail; it's a performance to treasure in a film I'll enjoy watching over and over again.Don't let the reviews put you off; give this one a chance.

Not the classiest line in the film, but it gives you the gist of a story about competitive hairdressing that is not totally unprecedented. Kevin Allen's The Big Tease of two years ago had Scottish hair 'artiste' Crawford battling against his barber nemesis to win the Platinum Scissors competition. Here, the plot is an elaborate framework for the kind of hearty, slice of life humour that made The Full Monty a smash hit. Championing the underdogs seems to be the only driving factor that makes up a large portion of British films. Our poor, downtrodden working classes are the subject again, and while there is plenty of meat left on that kind of idea, if it is done properly, writer Simon Beaufoy seems to be left only with the bones of The Full Monty to work with, despite an acclaimed cast including Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson, Rachel Griffiths and Warren Clarke. Translated to screen this time by director Paddy Breathnach, Blow Dry admittedly has enough guts about it to feature terminal illness, and alternative lifestyles within the characters of Sandra (Griffiths), who ran off with her hairstylist's wife Shelley (Richardson), who has cancer, but they seem like contrived details to wrench some emotion out of the story, and are never fully tackled. There also seems to be an unfair ratio of American to British actors happening in British films lately. We get the token Brit in American films from time to time, but these days our films are being infiltrated by bad accents and over-rated actors. Rising American star Josh Hartnett plays Brian, Phil's (Rickman) trainee barber son, who is the link to tie up animosity between his parents and coax them into entering the National British Hairdressing Championships which has come to Keighley for some reason. Hartnett's accent has been stitched together from every over-heard vernacular from the whole of the UK, which does nothing for the film's sincerity. Along with far too many sub-plots, and wince-worthy clich√©s, Blow Dry undermines the abilities of its cast, and the people it represents, which makes for a weak film from a strong writer. The only good thing about this, is the realistic portrayal of stylists own atrocious hair-do's.

The major feel-good aspect that prevailed throughout was the changing family dynamics of our times and we how we still manage to pull together into a family no matter how weird everybody else may think it is.  That certainly was underplayed, but just enough was left in the final cut to make me happy.The score is a strangely interesting mix of your usual stuff reflecting the emotional undertones and some more modern movement during the actual haircutting scenes.

I sought out Blow Dry because I love Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman and the late, great Natasha Richardson ... but it took me ages to find the DVD because it had these two random American kids on the cover.I was puzzled because Richardson, Rickman and Nighy had obviously been relegated to sub-plot which seemed incredible, but I watched it anyway. In the event, the marketing became only more baffling. I can only assume that the publicists played on Josh Hartnett and Rachael Leigh Cook for the American market, but in doing so they must have put off an awful lot of people like me - and surely Richardson at least carried plenty of weight in the US? And Nighy and Rickman are hardly unknowns!Anyway, now that I've found it in spite of the marketing people totally missing the point, I can review it. Blow Dry is whimsical, gentle and funny - and I mean that in the best possible way. It's a British comedy in the best tradition, understated, warm and centred solidly in the very ordinary lives of very ordinary people.Bill Nighy is predictably surreal and steals every scene he's in, but handles his role as the devious, dastardly but ultimately vulnerable and really quite likable villain of the piece very well. Alan Rickman struggles a little to portray his character's bitterness and hostility at first, but as the character warms up he comes into his own. Given his character's back story it must have been something of a task both for Rickman and for the writers to avoid making him utterly pitiable, but they managed it and Phil comes out the hero, still hurting but beginning to move forward with life in totally non-pathetic fashion.The screen belongs, though, to Natasha Richardson. The relationship between Shelley, played by Richardson, and Sandra is brilliant; totally convincing but not in any way more of an issue than it should be. There's a brief moment of surprise when you realise they're a couple, but it's written and played so well that you very quickly accept it and it becomes simply part of the story. Richardson's balancing act between pathos and comedy is finely-tuned and very admirable; the fact that she's dying is never forgotten, but neither is it allowed to overshadow the plot or stifle the comedy. For one of the best examples I have ever seen of good, simple writing skilfully delivered, watch Richardson's scene with the doctor in which her character learns she is terminal; it should not be possible to be that sad and yet funny at the same time!My one complaint with this film is the casting of Josh Hartnett as Phil and Shelley's son, Brian. Rachael Leigh Cook is non-descript and suffers from being on the same screen as Bill Nighy, but at least they just let her be American even if she was a strange choice in the first place. Josh Hartnett, meanwhile, should never have been allowed anywhere near this film, and all the line-cutting in the world (and you get the impression they cut as much as they could get away with) can't prevent him from ruining what should have been some of the finest scenes in the film. The scene about halfway through in which Richardson's character reveals to Phil and Brian that she has cancer and is dying should have been a deeply moving showcase for the talents of Richardson and Rickman, but the viewer is thrown completely out of the moment by Hartnett's utterly appalling trampling of the Yorkshire accent - which, in spite of its awfulness, still seems to have been absorbing enough to prevent him from actually acting at the same time.Aside from this utterly bewildering casting choice, Blow Dry is a fantastic film - I could rave about it even longer, but your time would be better spent just watching it.

I decided to watch Blow Dry because of Rachael Leigh Cook, not even because of Josh Hartnett. If I had known that I'd find Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy and some of their fellows, the ride would have been very different. Fortunately; I didn't know.The events in Blow Dry unfold in a very peculiar way. In fact, the film is a peculiar comedy with peculiar characters that go through the most peculiar situation. Surprisingly, they are all human beings at last; there's a buried story between them and they show natural emotions as they speak. Maybe it's Simon Beaufoy's solid screenplay, or the fact that the past explains every action and, unlike typical romantic comedies, characters know each other and don't fall in love within days.What makes the picture dynamic and enjoyable is that there are not only two main characters, or only one love story. The plot shows the lives of two families encountered (one separated) by one peculiar (yes) activity hairdressing. The annual British Hairdressing competition takes place in Keighley, a little town. This competition, declares the mayor Tony (Warren Clarke) Will change the history of this town.Raymond Robertson (Bill Nighy), the world champion, assists the competition with his daughter Christine (Rachael Leigh Cook) alongside him. She'll be one of his models, given that the competition consists on different kinds of hair styles done to different people. Robertson is scared for only one man from Keighley who could enter the competition Phil Allen (Alan Rickman).Allen cuts hairs in a local barbershop with his son Brian (Josh Hartnett), but has been out of competitions for ten years, since the day his wife Shelley (Natasha Richardson) ran away with his model Sandra (Rachel Griffiths) in a lesbian affair that left him all alone. There are things unsaid here; more than we could ever imagine. The stages of the competition take place and the characters' relationships evolve.Who wins the tournament, why and under which circumstances becomes less interesting as we see the other part of the film being developed; the part of the emotions. Paddy Breathnach, the director manages all of this perfectly, leaving a lot of room for the comedy and taking advantage of every illuminated moment the script presents.These illuminations arrive with the cast of gifted actors and the different colors they bring. From the younger, like Rachael Leigh Cook who hasn't been doing much lately but has a great career for her age and a beautiful smile to connect with her talent; and Josh Hartnett, with a well accomplished British accent and experimenting with comedy before his lead in 40 days and 40 nights. To the elder, like the duo created by Richardson and Griffiths, which depends on a lot of accurate chemistry; and Warren Clarke's Tony, who is a revelation as he gains confidence while the days go by in the competition.But finally, those relaxed and calmed old men (to put it in a way) who have great talents and make anyone laugh, but probably will never be recognized for it. When I saw Galaxy Quest I noticed certain uniqueness in Alan Rickman's voice and look; years after it's still there. The man makes me laugh with no efforts, and so does Bill Nighy, an eternal stubborn and annoying actor who couldn't care less about the roles he plays; so to ridicule them, which makes them perfect.British comedies are and have been the funniest comedies of the world; it is because of actors like Rickman and Nighy&#133;Believe me.

This is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It had a lot of entertainment value, but in an intelligent, highly eccentric way. It wasn't laugh-out-loud funny, but weird funny. It was intriguing. I hesitate to say it was really good, but it certainly was an experience! The actors were all very watchable (even poor speech-impaired Josh, most of whose lines were fragmented half-sentences - the only right choice!). Bill Nighy is always a pleasure, so too for Rickman and Richardson. Rachael Leigh Cook was a beauty to behold (though I still find it difficult to dissociate her from that awful, awful piece of teen idiocy that was She's All That). Rachel Griffiths was also good. Heidi Klum was just the right type for her role (wow, didya see that fan 'do she sported towards the end?!). And the other minor characters - like the Kilburn Kutters and the Style Warriors, and the whole thing with the dead body getting a Sid Vicious hair-do - were really some of the best elements in the movie.Importantly, this movie had a good and satisfying end.

Natasha Richardson is another under-used and under-admired star. The rest of the somewhat odd lot of fine character actors came through with typical good-indie-film great performances as well.I recall reading some flak from some folks in England, complaining about Josh Hartnet's non-Yorkshire accent. Maybe. I don't know what a Yorkshire accent sounds like, although I am a lover of the pudding. But Hartnet only spoke half a dozen times, and then only 2 or 5 words each time. So perhaps it's a small and trivial sacrifice for the audience to make, that is, if the accent was really off. From here (California), it sounded muffled and somehow like a Scotsman trying to speak while swallowing potatoes.Blow Dry isn't Strictly Ballroom. Heck-- it's not even Moulin Rouge, nor Brassed Off. But it IS good fun, with a mostly innocent heart and fresh-enough writing and acting to make it worthwhile. Lighten up! ...and enjoy yourself with this DVD rental, perhaps?

It's funny and good-hearted (it figures, from the writer of The Full Monty), and I can't say the premise isn't original.  Come on, what other movies have there been that take place in a National Hairdressers Competition?  I can be wrong, and if you can name another please let me know.  It gave a pretty good exploration into these little-known competitions, but I still felt more could've been done with the setup.As a saving grace, we have a cast of talented actors.  Alan Rickman, who everyone knows as Bruce Willis' nemesis in Die Hard, is terrific as usual. He's a fine English actor with a strong screen presence.  Natasha Richardson, who I didn't even recognize at first, is also good.  She wears an obviously phony blonde wig throughout the film, since she plays a cancer patient still undergoing kemotherapy.  I kept watching her saying to myself, I know I've seen that actress before!  Where the hell have I seen her??!!! Rachel Griffiths, who I previously badmouthed for her over-the-top performance as Johnny Depp's mother in Blow, is also good as Natasha's lesbian lover.  I guess she should stay away from American movies...lol. Well, I thought she was very good and I feel like taking back my harsh remarks.  I enjoyed Warren Clarke as the ringleader of the big event.  He is very funny, and I didn't even know him by name before viewing this movie. For some reason, I felt as if I've seen him before.  I was delighted to find out that he was Dim in A Clockwork Orange!  Of course, he looks much different (and much heavier) now.  Well, I hope to see him in more movies. Josh Hartnett is OK, but his accent drifts at points.  Overall, I think he pulled off a pretty convincing accent, but I think English directors should stick to casting English actors.  I used to think that it sounded better when American actors do English accents than English actors doing American accents.  First of all, I'm sure English actors can point out the inaccuracies on the accents better than me.  Second of all, I take that back.  Though Michael Caine couldn't quite pull off an American accent in Cider House Rules, there are still a good deal of English actors who can do very convincing accents like Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branaugh, Kate Beckinsale, etc.  Speaking of bad accents, was Heidi Klum (who was even more unrecognizable than Natasha, in a HUGE blonde wig!) actually trying to do an English accent?  She used the word bloody at one point, so I'm guessing yes.  Couldn't she just play a German?  Wouldn't that have been easier? Models have a hard-enough time acting; don't make them put on accents.  I think they also used Klum to help the marketing.  On the back of the DVD box, they showed her as...Heidi!  Without the stupid blonde wig.  So I expected to see her in the movie as herself and not playing a silly character.  OK, I vented my frustrations.  *breathes*The plot is quite predictable.  Don't expect any surprises.  But the characters are likeable and well-developed.  I liked how the subject of lesbianism wasn't exploited.  Most of the time when you see lesbian characters in movies, they're either 1) used to create a hot, steamy sex scene/ 2) used to bring out a preachy, politically correct message/ or 3) used as objects of homophobic humor.  It's not even verbally expressed that the two characters are lesbians, and at times you assume they're just real good friends.  Rarely do I see the subject handled in a non-superficial manner.This is not a laugh-out-loud comedy, but it does have laughs and they are earned honestly.  No cheap shots.  No slapstick.  However, the movie as a whole doesn't quite possess a unique, significant quality.  Though it's entertaining and funny, I probably won't remember much about it as time goes by.  Doesn't have an everlasting quality, but I still think it's a good rental.My score  7 (out of 10)         "},{"Title":"Alan Rickman knows where the Fountain of Youth is.","Date":"12 March 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  So, the movie's plot is a waste of time.

Well-that's what it's SUPPOSED to be about. The movie's a bit deceptive, in it's advertising and that's the main problem I had with it. While I didn't hate or even dislike, this flick and even found some parts enjoyable, I would not market this as a comedy. While there are a few funny moments, this is, by and large, a drama. There are many characters but they are all linked to Shelly, played with excellence by Natasha Richardson. Shelly has just found out she has terminal cancer. There are a lot of estrangements. Estrangements between lovers, children, parents, spouses, etc etc. And yes, in the midst of all this is the hair dressing competition that will ultimately bring all together again.There are, sometimes, movies that can pull off the combination of comedy/drama thing very well. Blow Dry doesn't quite do it though. It is surprisingly heavy for almost the first 40 minutes. While I like heavy movies just fine, my question is, if one is flicking channels and tunes in for a good comedy, where is the comedy? It doesn't really start getting funny for quite awhile and even then is never really laugh out loud funny. But, by that time, many may turn it off anyway.Likewise, if someone wants a good drama they are not even likely to know this might be one, from it's description. Bow Dry has a reputation as being a comedy and I don't think many people who have heard of it would expect it to be so heavy. With a movie like this I think it would have been more enjoyable as straight comedy or straight drama.The other problem I had was the competition itself. Where was it? The whole hair dressing competition is more of a backdrop to Shelly's story and the dynamics between the characters. Woefully little of the actual competition is even showed. Virtually no glamor till the final round, and even then, much to little of it.Blow Dry is a movie that could have been worse, but was made much better by the superb casting of Richardson. I wish the movie as a whole had been stronger, because as weak as I found the movie, she still succeeded in playing the heck out of Shelly and elevating the character into unforgettable movie character status. Imagine what she would have done with a stronger movie....Although, I didn't like Blow Dry all that much, the end was very sweet and I did care about the characters, particularly Shelly. So that's why I'm giving it a 5 of 10, about average, though Richarson's performance and the last 15-20 minutes gets a 10. I just wish the whole movie could have been in the same league as the above mentioned. It was decent, though, not awful, and Allan Rickman has great feet. My vote is 5 of 10.

The film is uniformly and off-puttingly low-lit throughout, presumably a directorial decision but possibly the failure of sufficient electricity or sunlight to reach a positively medieval Keighley.Generally speaking, the decision to cast Josh Hartnett was so ill-advised that watching his performance in this film, and hearing his lamentable Dick-Van-Dyke-style attempts to mimic a Northern accent, is almost enough to cast a shadow over his other work (which has generally been of a high standard).Alan Rickman has no more excuse for his mocked-up accent which is ridiculously exaggerated and spoken with a clich√©d hairdresser lisp, the combined effect of which will leave anyone from West Yorkshire either laughing out loud for the full running time or feeling somewhat insulted that this debacle was ever put onto film.Differing opinions over the casting aside, it is unlikely that many will find this movie very funny. This seems absolutely reprehensible in a would-be comedy. Love or hate Beaufoy, 'The Full Monty' was a genuinely funny film with a good selection of big-laughs. However, Blow Dry's humour, where it exists, is facile and normally pokes fun at the supposed oddities of working-class culture. Opportunities for humour are overshadowed by the frequent lurches into confrontational and embittered 'realistic' scenes which play out like poorly scripted 'Eastenders' exchanges.The half-baked hair Dressing theme is actually more-or-less incidental to the contorted but occasionally well-worked plot of former lovers, professional rivalry and long-lost childhood friends, and is nothing like as interesting as the strip-club milieu of The Full Monty. It could, one suspects, easily have been exchanged for countless others without rupturing the proceedings too much. The actual 'competition' scenes are a chore to sit through, consisting of the usual hastily-assembled montage sequences focusing on only one or two competitors. Rickman's credentials as a hairdresser seem less convincing than his accent, if that is possible.Amidst the usual cohort of British actors is Rachel Leigh Cook, who looks quite appropriately lost in the movie, probably wondering, like most of the audience, how Hartnett and she became embroiled in all of this. The only scene of any significant originality in the movie, in fact, is that in which Cook chooses to cut off all of her hair to escape from the whole competition circuit - again quite uncannily mirroring audience psychology.In retrospect, it can be seen that the late 90s and early 00s saw a glut of these 'provincial' comedies that were set in deliberate opposition to the London of Richard Curtis' 'Four Weddings' universe. This had a polarising effect so that mainstream British films, and especially comedies, were either set in working-class locations akin to Royston Vasey or else in an unreal city of Whitehall and Anglo-American relationships. Some such productions, like 'The Full Monty' or 'Brassed Off', were good films, others, like this one or something like 'The One and Only' (which was little more than a promotional film for the North East) were terrible. British comedies have become more sophisticated in recent years, and are no longer satisfied with such stereotypes.

Paddy Breathnach must have done his best though, as I honestly do not believe a director could have allowed such poor acting in his film had the casting choice actually been his. And whats the deal with 'Quirky British movies'? They are by and large fantastical hodgepodges crying out for originality but consistently looking like the idea was scibbled on the back of a beermat.
