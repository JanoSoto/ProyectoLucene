Being human entitles us to our own unique quirks and eccentricities that make us individuals. When we 'seemingly' normal people are influenced by our ever-changing society, that is when the humor begins.I think the true beauty of this movie is in the acting. Waters guides his cast into committed characterizations, adding layer upon layer of sub-text until they blossom before your eyes. Waters approaches his characters the way a painter approaches his easel and taking a mental snapshot, paints his perspective. Add all these factors in and you see why I say Pecker is a great movie!Bravo, John. I always enjoy your work, thank you for sharing your art and perspective with the world.

In this time around, Waters directs PECKER, about how the seemingly normal photographs taken by an average small-town kid named Pecker (Eddie Furlong) become over- night successes by different art moguls. Of course, many misadventures abound as Pecker encounters many people with different opinions about his works of art.The performances are basically the main highlight of the film. Furlong does a good portrayal of the snapshot-taking teen, while ChristinaRicci also shines as Pecker's alienated girlfriend. Low-key teen actor Brendan Sexton III steals the film as Pecker's best friend Matt, a go-go-dancing klepto, just the right kind of character found in a John Waters' flick!

It is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the blithe, innocent Pecker (played appealingly by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. Other great characters include Pecker's friend Matt (he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room.The movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer, and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy-handed about it. There is always a risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of common people, of sliding into a kind of reverse holier than thou - but Pecker avoids these traps, allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject.I recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun.

After he emerged from the underground, Waters produced trash-lite versions of his earlier works (Cry Baby, Polyester, Hairspray) that to die-hard fans looked and tasted like watered down liqueur. Pecker, which doesn't attempt to regurgitate early successes, is a slight, quiet, humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world. Waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you couldn't imagine anyone being able to give away if it wasn't emblazoned with the Waters name. Edward Furlong is fine as Pecker and Waters' non-histrionic style is at ease with the subject.

It's a typical topic of John Waters Baltimore-based independent comedies to show the weird sides of the American way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative backlashes by exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown.Edward Furlong of Terminator 2 fame plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and Water's long-time actress Mink Stole. Although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and can't compete with the fast  and furious joke attacks of Water's brilliant Serial Mom, it's still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie-girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable dish... Pecker is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, media hypes, middle-class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!

He constantly takes pictures of those around him.  When he puts on a small show in his workplace a New York agent buys the lot and offers him a show at her NY gallery.  The show turns him famous for his honest photos of his `culturally challenged' family and friends.  But fame has a price and soon he must turn the tables on the art crowd who look down on his family.I approached this with a certain amount of good feeling.  From the very start we have wonderfully camp music and small town trashy characters &#150; we're in Waters-ville. The actually story is quite simple and doesn't quite hang together as a narrative.  However it's all done with a nice charm that makes it fly by, only occasionally does the film drag and the plot weaknesses are revealed.Waters used to have a niche market in camp and bad taste, however with so many people doing bad taste comedies nowadays he seems to have toned it all down a bit.  However he still can do this in his sleep, although the story could have been stronger and he needed to direct with more focus and direction.Furlong is really good in the lead &#150; you have to admire his role choices (Little Odessa, American History X, this and others) as he could have just tried to be a heart throb after T2.  Similarly Ricci is pretty good in a role that isn't quite trashy but isn't mainstream either.  The support cast are also good as they have more of the characters that we expect from Walters as well as some famous faces (Lilli Taylor, Martha Plimpton, Patty Hearst) &#150; Brendan Sexton III as Matt is really good but the award for funniest role goes to Hulsey for angry sugar junkie Little Chrissy.Overall I found this enjoyable despite the story not really moving anywhere fast.  Fans may find this to be Waters-lite but even then he can put out a good film.

Unlike previous films Pecker is set in modern Baltimore of 1998.And it's centered around a young man named Pecker. Lest you think it describes him anatomically or behaviorally, what it really does describe is his way of eating as a child, sort of pecking at his food. Of course it wouldn't be John Waters without the double entendre.Pecker as played by Edward Furlong was given a camera as a kid and it's become an obsession with him, to photograph life and find art in it. Art's everywhere, in his girlfriend's laundromat, in the sandwich shop where he works, in his grandmother's obsession with her talking Virgin Mary icon, even in the garbage where two rats are mating.Soon his pictures attract attention from the art world. But when that happens Pecker's own world starts to crumble around him. How and will he get it back is the story of Pecker.John Waters surrounds Furlong with a nice cast of supporting players with the usual Dickensian names for their characters. Best are Christina Ricci as Pecker's girl friend, Baltimore's laundromat Queen, and Brendan Sexton as his best friend and professional kleptomaniac.Pecker is another of John Waters's lighthearted look at life and some of the strange things we find in it. I think only the most hidebound of rightwing people will not find something amusing in Pecker.

For nearly four decades, the Hairspray creator has made a career out of letting people know he's gay, through odd ball characters, weird story lines, and every innuendo in the book. Pecker is the story of obsession, weather it's about the main character's obsession with photography, his girlfriends obsession with her laundromat, or his managers obsession with him, everyone has a strange obsession. Pecker (Edward Furlong) is a teenager from the small town of Baltimore, Maryland, who has been taking pictures for years. Finally, he's having a show at the fast food restaurant he works at and to everyone's surprise, a New York City gallery owner shows up to make Pecker he new protÃ©gÃ©. The whole family goes to the big city, where Pecker becomes a star, putting his town and his whole family under a microscope. As is common in Water's films, the characters are as strange as can be, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why he decided to portray Baltimore as a small town. Edward Furlong stars as Pecker, and even though he has long been one of my favorite actors, even he couldn't save this film. I like weird and admire something different, but Pecker was so far out there, that it became a farce of itself. The characters are uninteresting, the penis jokes are old, and the obsessions are just so above and beyond believable that it turns the whole film into one bad joke. As I said everyone is obsessed with something and that really foreshadows the main story. From his grandmother who talks to the virgin Mary to his sister who is the biggest gay pimp in Baltimore, all the obsessions blend into one big gay, confusing, ridiculous ending. I've seen several John Waters films and for the most part have found them to be pretty funny, but Pecker is just so far out there, that it's almost unwatchable.

By now, we know what to expect with a John Waters comedy colorfully outrÃ© characters with quirky jobs whose lives are underscored with rude, snorting satire and odd, funny selections on the soundtrack. Edward Furlong is confidently goofy in the leading role of Pecker (so-called because of his boyhood tendency to pick at his food), but many of the other performances are stiff or awkward. Waters is an idea-man; he sets up potentially raucous running jokes and populates his scenario with wild caricatures (like lesbian strippers), yet he's still having trouble getting those ideas onto the screen. His timing is so wobbly that many scenes border on being funny but ultimately miss the mark, while certain characters (like Pecker's bartender sister and his religious ventriloquist Memama) keep promising to be funnier than they are. Of course, writer-director Waters is an acquired taste--some will find his prankish sense of humor naughty and winking, while others will balk early--yet he's in danger of repeating himself. The Baltimore milieu might be played out for him (however when Waters ventures into New York high society, he doesn't seem comfortable there at all). Like many of his recent films, the final act is just a hammy mess of over-playing, while the satirical points Waters hopes to make get lost in a deluge of happy-hearted sleaze. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"a gem of a film for artists!","Date":"16 February 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" John Waters movies are like John Travolta movies.

If you liked Hairspray, Cry Baby and Lust in The Dust, you will definitely like this film. The dysfunctional characters are wonderful and I think this flick says a lot about where we must draw our inspiration as artists.

The rest of the film deals with Pecker's new found fame asNew York's biggest photographer. The best part of this film is the continous satire of the New York artworld, almost definitely inspired by John Water's early career in themovies and his later career being a photographer. For example,back in the sixties, he would play his short films at small cafes inBaltimore just like Pecker showed his artwork in the sub shop.Also, the opening credits which are somewhat shaky are inspiredby the fact that when John showed his early films, the projectorwould always shake and make the picture move.  Of course, no John Waters film is complete without eitherover-the-top or excellent acting and this film has a bit of both.Christina Ricci manages to blend both of them together in the bestrole of her career as a neurotic laundromat owner.

The strongest message I got from the movie was how autobiographical it seems to be(though I am sure John would deny anything as self-revealing as that admission). A boy from Baltimore goes about his way doing what he enjoys and he is suddenly thrust into cult status, losing his privacy and the way things were in the process. What was just the way Baltimore is, is elevated in the mind of the NY culture-vultures into camp and a look into authenticity that they can somehow distance themselves from. When the art types become the subject of an exhibition, it is suddenly not funny anymore and Pecker is abandoned. John Waters seems to have also travelled this road, as long as he was making films about transvestites and hippies, America could distance themselves and snicker and sneer. Now that his targets are suburbia, the art world and Hollywood (Cecil B. Demented), a little closer to middle America, suddenly the joke is off and we complain about how Waters has gone commercial and should return to Pink Flamingos type movies. Of course, we forget that Pink Flamingos has been, in terms of money making, Waters most commercial movie. Either you will get this movie or you won't. You will enjoy it immensely or think it trash.

(I rarely watch a movie more than once.) There is just something so endearing and enduring about this little film.  First off, John Waters (writer and director) is brilliant. Can you think of a better name for a strip club than The Pelt Room? And I'll let you find out for yourself what teabagging is. The characters are all so likeable, even the ones who are at odds with one another. The dialogue, set ups and situations are so creative, irreverent and borderline (OK, cross the border) tasteless, that you have to love them. There's little I can say that won't ruin something.  Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, and Lili Taylor (Joe lies!) are the headliners, but the smaller parts pull this gem together. Pecker is wonderful in the same way Raisin' Arizona is. And, hey, it's got Patty Hearst (Yes, that Patty Hearst) and an actress named Mink Stole in it.

He had seen it at a friend's house and thought it was one of the best comedies ever made. I was sceptical but after seeing it (about 5 times, including this past weekend), I would have to agree. Reading the outside reviews of this film as well as use comments, I find it very strange that others don't think this film is as funny as I do. One reviewer complained of stiff, forced dialog and a lot of people complained that this movie was too tame for a John Waters film. Now I like John Waters, but why do people insist that directors have to keep making the same kind of movies over and over?To me, Pecker is a film that captures a real slice of life. The characters in this film were caricatures, but so are some people. And the situations were silly, but, you know, I've seen sillier things in life. Overall, the film was very much about the kind of life me and my friends live, not just when were in college, but even now that we've graduated. The buses, the houses, the fun and games in the supermarket, are all the sorts of things you find in real life and the screwy thing Pecker and his friends and family do are the kind of things you do when, like the central character in Pecker, you ENJOY life and don't care what other people think and aren't out to impress anyone.

Simple art, done for the love of it, ruined by the fame and fortune you probably are not seeking anyway. Pecker gets recognition, but the ultimate sacrifice is made in the process. And the way he sees art in everything from grass stains to graffiti to his quirky neighborhood is exactly how a true artist's mind works. He adores his family even though they are clearly bizarre (maybe he loves them because of it?) He finds fun in everything, is not depressed by his surroundings but embraces it and makes it his own. He is innocent and full of wonder, and when the NYC art world threatens to corrupt him, he does not let it. Great movie, with the usual Waters weirdness. I loved it.

Pecker is one of his art films and is a real hoot. In the film the title character is one of those movie stereotypes, a guy who is known and loved by everybody in his neighborhood.  But then you realize that everybody else is a kind of stereotype, happy people.  The characters are all pretty two dimensional but that's OK when its intentional and it really does make them funny. So Pecker goes around taking pictures of all of these happy people who are thrilled to see their pictures at his first art show which just happens to be on the walls of the sandwich shop where he works.  Of course, a New York gallery owner walks in and 'discovers' Pecker which means fame, fortune, and ridicule of his neighbors by the outside world.

Pecker is a landmark for Waters since this is his first effort that was very mainstream in 1998, but for audiences and fans of his older work, it will most likely be a mediocre excursion. At least it's over pretty quickly.Nothing in Pecker is very funny. It lacks the satire and wit of Waters' previous pictures that weren't in his comfort zone. In his more modern films like, Cry-Baby and Serial Mom, I was able to retract a moral, a message, or even a clever parody element currently absent from Hollywood films. I wasn't able to pick up too much from Pecker, although it might be trying to play off of the rags to riches formula. If it is, it's too subtle to even notice.The story revolves around a teen nicknamed Pecker (Furlong). Apparently, he pecks at his food a lot and, viola, a strangely placed, perhaps innuendo-driven name was born. Nevermind. Pecker is an amateur photographer, which is already annoying. He is constantly snapping pictures. Click, click, click. Snap, snap, snap. And he never stops. It's almost maddening to see how many times he does it. Granted, real photographers don't care if you're in the middle of a conversation, if something appears to be interesting they'll interrupt you with a snap of a camera. It is realistic, but it's incredibly overdone.Pecker takes pictures of all kinds of things. From random facial expressions to private parts and sex acts. He captures them all. His long suffering girlfriend (Ricci) is oblivious to art, and she pretty much captures the personality of the rest of us as we wait for Pecker to break new ground or for Waters to win us over with some great comedic relief. But it's like waiting for Christmas in the dead of July. It's not going to come anytime soon, and it's foolish to expect such an occurrence.Pecker's work becomes recognized by a famous art dealer. His dysfunctional family is the ones that are the true victim to his acts. They are the ones exploited, and Pecker just sits back, wondering if he did anything to start this. One character that I found cute, but very underwritten (much like Christina Ricci's character) was the borderline kleptomaniac best friend of Pecker played by Brendan Sexton III, a terrific and underrated talent in the world of film. The problem is he never gets his time to shine either. Instead he's replaced by such desperate antics like Pecker's grandmother's talking Mary statue that is nothing but a frozen plot device that is practically useless. Not to mention, the film's love affair with constant flat jokes.Waters' regulars like Mary Vivian Pearce and Mink Stole are here, but not in mass amounts. Perhaps including Mink Stole as the grandmother would've provided a great deal of laughs. Laugh at you must but it would (1) make Pecker more tolerable than it already is, and (2) be the perfect, out of place role for her since she did such a wonderful job in Female Trouble as a fourteen year old girl who didn't look any younger than thirty.I've always said that anyone can throw on a cheesy costume and make a parody, many can make an homage to their favorite film, but only few could pull of a very good satire. John Waters can pull of a great satire and possibly do all of those other things very well. So why did he choose to focus on a film with no wit, direction, fun, laughs, or purpose? Pecker isn't long at eighty-six minutes, but becomes a monotonous excursion through recycled screenplay odds and ends before eventually arriving at a questionably worthy conclusion. What the *click* was that all about? Starring Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, and Brendan Sexton III. Directed by John Waters.

Don't get me wrong, I'd rather have been at lottery HQ collecting my winnings, on the phone to a representative from my local pub telling me that I've won free beer for life or even simply enjoying a night in with several top supermodels; but on the whole, I rate the eighty five minutes I spent watching this as time well spent. The film is called 'Pecker' because that's the name of it's central character, but something tells me that Mr John Waters named the film so for other, more innuendo related, reasons. Anyway, Pecker is a rather odd young man who lives in a rather odd small town somewhere in America. Pecker's hobby is to take photos of anything and everything, and claim that it's art. This hobby, one day, attracts the attention of a New York art dealer and Pecker is transported into super-stardom, much to the dismay of his Laundromat obsessed girlfriend and the rest of his small town.Director John Waters directs the film in a very surreal style, which gives it a very unique edge, and instantly grabs your attention. Waters evidently doesn't care about the integrity of film-making, and so sees fit to meld together something that can easily be seen as a mess. The leads carry Waters' mess with vigour and gusto, but never really impress or deliver great performances. Edward Furlong gives his character a naive edge, which bodes well with his small town roots. He does look more than a little bit embarrassed at times, but sort of adds to the kitsch appeal of the movie. Christina Ricci does her usual 'bitch' thing, but it doesn't work in this film as her character is supposed to be a more down to earth and snob hating, so to have her as a snob herself ensures that the film loses yet more credibility and makes it even more of a mess. The film will offend some viewers for it's rather graphic lesbian strip club scene; not to mention it's central, gay club, location, and that adds weight to the idea that this is very much a 'love it or hate it' sort of film, and I'm sure that's how Waters wants it. I, however, do not add weight to that claim as I merely thought it was 'pretty good'. Take that John!

We have all seen one of these before, whether flicking through the channels through insomnia, or through plain boredom and seem to catch the first five minutes of the film. So I could not get any sleep, since my circadian rhythms is gone to pot, and the TV was my only source of entertainment of that day, due to the lack of motivation of going out and money I have. What can i say, I am a university student? Watch out for Spoilers.The main character Pecker, is a amateur shutterbug, who would take any pictures of his humdrum but quirky life. He takes pictures of his bizarre family, which would consist of a ADHD little sister, a female sibling who is an MC for a gay strip club, a grandma who is seems to hear the Virgin Mary speak to her, even though it is her who provides the voice for her, a philantrophic mother and a father who wants to boycott the lesbian strip club next door to his bar. The little world that he lives in gets the camera treatment and the local people get involved as well. Pecker decides to hold his photographs on show in his work place, whereby a high profile art collector sees his work and absolutely loves it. This is where the roller-coaster of Pecker's life begins. The art collector begins to show Pecker's work in the big art galleries, and he is a darling in the modern art scene, to the dismay and disgust of his townsfolk.The story is pretty basic with some gaping plot holes and a pretty easy ending to tie it up. However it is not the plot which gives it the enjoyment, but the characters and the predicaments that occur with them. I think Edward Furlong is perfect as the main character, however this is not a career defining movie for him, but somehow he did enjoy it. The indie darling Christina Ricci did not have enough to play on this role of Pecker's annoyed girlfriend, but she did what she could. The other characters were a little bit bizarre but seemed to fit into the movie quite well. Though there is one character I liked a lot, which was little Chrissy. She may have had probably one of the funniest scenes in the movie, where she is off the sugar and chocolate and onto the vegetables. She just snorts a piece of vegetable. That got me in stitches that no one can imagine.In conclusion, I think this movie does have to get some recommendation for at least trying hard to be funny, and the characters are quite amicable. However I wish they did not have a really fluffy ending. That was a let down.

Waters' own screenplay includes a wide assortment of eccentric characters, engaged in an uneasy truce with conservative doomsayers who cluck loudly from the sidelines, and he paints the mix in vivid colors, providing a unique visual backdrop for cartoon-like performances which teeter precariously on the brink of caricature. Furlong and co-star Christina Ricci are blank but charming, an 'ordinary' couple who retreat into anonymity as their lives are consumed by the demands of those around them Furlong's naive parents (Mary Kay Place and Mark Joy), fag-hag sister (Martha Plimpton), sugar-addicted brat sibling (Lauren Hulsey), and the Art crowd who live in their own little world, far removed from everyday reality (their reaction when forced to travel from New York to Baltimore is priceless!).

Unfortuneatly this is Atipical Waters. Depending on how you look at it this movie is either OK or terrible. As just a movie to be watched and enjoyed, Pecker falls well within the retches of good. Mainstream Directors of today could learn a lot for this particular piece. Most noteably that a good comedy doesn't have to be spectacular, high budget, or have lots of sight gags to be good. Pecker has a very clean formulaic story, delema, and ending that fits nicely into a boring saturday night. However, for waters fan this is a total letdown. While I'm sure that this tale is more of an auto-biography than anything else, it lacks that Water's edge. The movie is not really gross, sadistic, depraved, or really disgusting in any real way. Making it fall far short of what we, as an audiance, are used to see from this vulgar director. Pick any scene from Pink Flamingos and that surpasses anything this entire movie has to offer as far as tasteless. **Spoilers Ahead** The story of Pecker as a photographer who is fascinated by the macabre photographing his girlfireind, greasy food, rats screwing, and people getting tea-bagged showes viewers Water's own vision of life. The way that these images are sold to rich New Yorkers is also a parrellel to Water's work. The casting of Eddy Furlong is further a joke about Water's ideas. **End** In the end this movie comes across as a Water's film packedged for the public, mocking them in the process. It is a fun film to watch but nonetheless will disappoint John Water's fans. It's a self portailal and self-farce all in one. To conclude just watch it, laugh, and learn about the man. This is a good introductory piece for people interested in John Water's. However if all you want in depravity rent Meet the Feebles.

Pecker sets-up like a stock plot holding together a Marx Brother's comedy. Stuffed shirts, in the form of New York art snobs, are punctured by hometown just folks. Unfortunately this isn't the Marx Brothers. Pecker's family and friends are neither fun nor interesting. And Water's undistinguished cast functions on a level well below the most routine Ma and Pa Kettle vehicle. The character acting is flat; Mary Kay Place, Mark Joy, Jean Schertler, Brendan Sexton, Carolyn Stayer, Jack Webster barely register on the screen. The supporting bit players are instantly forgettable. This is the fault of Pat Moran's casting judgement and Vince Peranio's flavorless set designs, neither of whom are helped by Water's lackluster jokes and apathetic timing. Any humdrum episode of Cheers is executed with more flair. Furlong, Lili Taylor, Martha Plimpton and Lauren Hulsey all appear ready and alert for a good show and are able to plow through soggy dialog while still showing signs of life. Unfortunately, none are given enough space to stage a filibuster and save the picture. Pecker is exactly the type of production that should have been vetted by a committee of Hollywood execs. They might have pitched better ideas about how to farm this turkey. The industry and audiences have caught up with the Waters program. They devour films and TV shows that make Mondo Trasho look respectable. That Waters would like to trade some of his cult status for box office success is understandable, but he is seriously misjudging the general audience who want something deeper and even more unique - not the same thing as on TV except more generic! Almost gave the Pecker an extra two stars for a fantastic Mink Stole cameo, but had to rescind them on account of a wasted Cindy Sherman appearance. John Waters is lucky the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce doesn't strip him of his citizenship after this pooped-out portrayal of his beloved hometown. "},{"Title":"I love you Shelley!

Anyone who cannot imagine what these Experts find so appealing about modern art, will enjoy seeing these pretentious snobs get so full of themselves over Pecker, a boy who just found a broken camera and starts shooting his friends and neighbors.Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2 Judgment Day) was surprisingly good as Pecker. There wasn't a lot of meat on any of the roles in this film, but he really shines.Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes in with another great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was a banner year for Ricci (Buffalo '66, The Opposite of Sex, and Pecker.Lili Taylor, who had the only good role in The Haunting, was also a significant part of the film and really made it enjoyable.There are many funny scenes, but I have to say the best was when a crown gathers screaming, We want bush!

That movie was really so bad, that I was convinced that all his movies would be like that. But when the DVD of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie, I decided to give it a try anyway. Only a couple of days later it was shown on television. I taped it out of curiosity and now that I've seen it, I can tell you that this Pecker sure is a lot better than A Dirty Shame.In this movie we see how a young 'nobody' from Baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of New York. He's a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby. When he keeps his very first 'exhibition' in the shop where he works, his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness. His photographs are sold for enormous prices, but when he sees how his family, friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to New York, they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him. And they do, but what they get to see there, is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine...It's not difficult to see why I loved this movie a lot more than A Dirty Shame. The first reason is that this movie has an actual story. This movie really has something to say and isn't just intended to shock as many people as possible. The fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they don't know what the reality is like, isn't just funny, it's not that far from the truth either. I guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way. Nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it, but apparently we are all supposed to like it. The second reason why I liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer. I'm not saying that everything that you will see is great, but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci,...Overall this isn't a great movie, but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes - which never really go too far - this is an enjoyable movie.

His last film, the stupidly underrated Serial Mom, was a masterpiece, revealing a film-maker fully in control of his form, like late-period Hawks, hitting every satirical target, 'important' and trivial, with gleeful gusto.The problem with Pecker, which seems to be a parody on portentous filmmakers Altman and Antonioni, is that it is aimless.  Like Godard, Waters needs the blueprint of a conventional narrative model on which to hang his ideas, style, anger and wit, even if it is only to subvert it.  The great thing about films like Cry-Baby and Hairspray is how he reverses the cliches of 1950s teen flicks and melodramas, breathes life into stereotypes, and moves the freaks and outsiders from the margins  into main roles.But Pecker has a dearth of arresting characters or even types - either the actors are uncharismatic, or the script is weak.  There is no plot to speak of, so the Hollywood conventions Waters is so brilliant at mocking are absent.  Edward Furlong leaves a big black hole in the movie with his irritating non-performance in a non-existent role.  The most unforgivable disappointment, though, is the failure to properly use Christina Ricci, the best actress in movies today, and, surely, the ideal Waters heroine.The glaring problem with the film is its irony.  Previously, Waters' strength was his ambivalent attitude towards the repressive conformity he loathed, and the desire for (parodic) conformity of his affectionate freaks. This reaches its zenith in Serial Mom, where Kathleen Turner is obviously a product of the strain of middle-class propriety, yet also the delirious driving force of the film.Here, though, the enemy is the New York intellectual elite, the most dated, pointless sitting target there is.  Who cares about the fraud that is modern photography? - it's hardly a stifling social force like the suburban mindset, or American apartheid.Whether Pecker is a stand-in for the director is unclear.  His photographs attempt to capture life, but are mostly whimsical or  contrived.  Is the film a plea for the provincial,  or a satire on it?  That's the problem the irony is so diffused that it ceases to be effective.  Everyone is so nice that melodrama is negated.  Perhaps Waters is trying to justify his decision to make 'local' films in Baltimore, but that's silly - making great movies like Serial Mom is justification enough.Sheer good will forces a few guffaws, but even the jaded Simpsons take off on modern art was funnier than this.  Waters' trademark stylisation is threadbare.  There isn't enough material here for an amusing short.

His earlier films were not well written either but at least they dared to show us something new and had an certain honesty even in their campy style. Edward Furlong wins the award for the most wooden and dull title character of the year. Christina Ricci who was brilliant in Buffalo 66 walks through this picture wondering, as we are, why she ever agreed to do this film (something she should have asked herself before doing Billy Zane's horrible I Woke Up Early the Day I Died also). Mink Stole, the only real hope for some good camp, was given nothing to do - yawn. Martha Plimpton's role as Pecker's sister was simply not funny.

Rushmore was bad enough). Pecker seems to whip you over the head with one absurd, offbeat character after another, most of whom (if not all) are scarcely likable and hardly believable Pecker (played by Edward Furlong (who, by the way, I really liked in American Heart)), here in this movie, well he just makes you want to open up a can of whoop-ass on the annoying little punk every time he points that stupid camera at someone or something. I just didn't like him, or his sister, or his shoplifting friend, or his foulmouthed girlfriend, or his mother, or his grandmother (his dad was okay... well, on second thought, no he wasn't). I DID like Patty Hearst, though (who might in fact be the only reason to watch this film. I LOVE Patty Hearst.)(Also, by the way... I know from personal experience that you DON'T just go around pointing a camera at people and surprising them with a candid photograph.

True, Waters' movies were offensive, shocking and often repulsive but they simultaneously were unique outsiders in an overall politically correct American film industry. Nearly twenty years later, there's very few ingeniousness left inside Water's mind and it also looks like he has developed morality and grew a consciousness. He still pretends to be controversial by portraying his beloved Baltimore as an antipathetic wasteland where the people are shameless and eccentric, but he sure ain't provoking anybody. The plot of Pecker is very ordinary and basically just a reworking of two of the oldest 'lessons' in storytelling. 1) success and wealth do not equal happiness and 2) home sweet home... even if it is Baltimore! Pecker works in a snack bar but he merely is obsessed by photography and spends his days stalking friends, family and neighbors with a camera as the extension of his eyes. During a local presentation, he's discovered by a fancy New York art dealer and, all of a sudden, every eminent art critic is interested in Pecker's portrayal of the 'culturally challenged' (like described beautifully in the film) models. The dialogs are dull, the script is unoriginal and most gags are so tasteless that they seem to come straight out of a Farrelly-brothers movie (sex in a cubicle?). The acting isn't very good neither and especially Christina Ricci was a bad choice to play the neurotic laundry-shrew. Thank God there also are some positive things to mention!

In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was cult film director with a small but devoted following. The earliest of these films were exceptionally perverse but oddly charming (such as the almost impossible to watch PINK FLAMINGOS--which features the eating of feces, among other revolting things). A bit later, his films were a bit less offensive, though they still had a bizarre home-made quality to them. These are the films I love the most, such as FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER, which are still offensive but manage to be a bit more palatable to the average viewer AND still feature the John Waters touches, such as horrible over-acting and a cast of lovable weirdos (such as Divine and Edith Massey--the only woman uglier than the cross-dressing Divine). Then, in the mid-80s onward, Waters actually made quite a few relatively normal films that were quite mainstream--culminating in his most mainstream film, HAIRSPRAY.Now, with PECKER, it seems that Waters is trying to combine his earliest style of films with the newer commercially attractive films. The film features material that is at times much more offensive than what you'd recently seen in CRY BABY, SERIAL MOM and HAIRSPRAY--and it would have resulting in this film receiving an X rating had it been made in the 70s or 80s--a close up beaver shot like you see repeatedly in PECKER was highly reminiscent of the early style. However, at the same time, the production values are very high and the story amazingly conventional despite the language and crotch shots. As a result, the film left me pretty cold. Plus, this is NOT a film I could let my kids watch--though I did have no problem with my oldest watching POLYESTER.As for the plot, it's obviously intended as a form of autobiography by Waters. While he had become more mainstream by 1998, the film's message is be true to your tacky and garish roots and the evils of being discovered by the right people. Perhaps the extremes in the film was his attempt to regain this original flavor, though without Divine, Edith Massey AND high production values, the effort comes up very short. I guess Waters never can truly go back!By the way, this film once again featured a small role for Patty Hearst and for her age, she was quite hot. Way to go Ms. Hearst!

Well, this is without a doubt the biggest waste of time in the history of movie watching.  It was real fun to watch someone click his camera for 90 minutes.  Yup, that's it.  That's the film right there. Boring story, boring characters....just plain boring.  It was the first time I felt like taking the tape out of the VCR and burning it.  I'm serious. I'm going to have to stop now because I could go way over 1,000 words describing what a nasty experience it was watching this !@#^.  Is there any way that the IMDB could change its voting structure and go below 1.  If at all possible, please give this a -100 for me.  Thank you for your time.

Pupil) something as ridiculously stupid as this movie pops its way out of the little toilet bowl. The acting was like watching a high school play full of burnt out no-talent drama students. And the story was like a happily ever after children's fairy tale with the f word nicely placed in at the appropriate times. If you like to stare at your screen in amazement at the utter nonsense that is trotting along from this movie, then please by all means, see Pecker.

Didn't laugh once. There are a few running jokes (the sugar-obsessed sister, the grandma and the Mary puppet, etc.) that were repeated throughout the film although they weren't funny the first time. John Waters should dig a hole in the ground and place his head within.

So in a sense Waters has surpassed himself with this movie a mediocrity is still better than garbage. The film profits only from a very good female cast, mostly Ricci and Kay Place. The movie has all the signatures of a Waters film very bad amateur actors in small roles, lousy and childish dialogues, and social satire which is far too obvious and unintelligent to have any kind of impact, comic or otherwise. Waters is always out to mock the silent majority, which is an easy target, and he does it, I believe, because of a frustration of knowing that the silent majority could never accept an untalented freak such as himself. He does make fun of the bogus NY art world, though, which is a good thing &#150; but I'd rather have someone talented do that.

We gave it 20 minutes but when the little girl is seen eating sugar right from the bag drooling - I had to turn it off.  Good movie if words like beaver and lesbian make you laugh.  Ricci wasted her time don't you waste yours.

The dialogue seems to have been written by an agoraphobic deprived of outside contact with every day life, and therefore has no idea how real people interact.  The acting in this horrible monstrosity also leaves much (miles) to be desired.  If I had ANYTHING to do with the production of this movie, I would hang my head in shame for the duration of my life.  Pecker's Grandmother (Full of grace!)  is particularly aggravating, and left me wondering when some heavy object (such as a piano, or maybe a large safe) would come loose from its overhead hoist apparatus and put an end to this pathetic attempt at a funny secondary character.This movie should be locked away in an underground vault somewhere,  where it would never see the light of day again for eternity.

I think a group of first-graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this. I'm dumber for having watched it, and God have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film.And after I finally turned it off, I actually had the urge to vomit.No one had a clue about photography when made this. No one had a clue about acting. No one had a clue about just about anything.I can't believe F/X shows this crap on occasion. The only time I had seen it was on one of the Starz! channels - not even the main one. And it was on at about 3 a.m. at that.
