As a romantic comedy, it can be enjoyed, but it doesn't blow me away like the big ones do. The cruelty was out of place, particularly the scene after Sam's and Max's first date. Individual scenes made sense and ran smoothly, but the whole film didn't have much cohesion for me. I found it difficult to believe Jay really had a relationship with the model Natasha, so much so that he was quite despondent after the breakup. I did actually like the sliminess of David Schwimmer's character. His Band Of Brothers role is the only one I can remember in which he performed even better. Mili Avatal as Sam showed no warmth or sincerity, I'm sorry to say. This movie always leaves me wishing I had chosen another film to watch.

This is a clue for us. We are going to have to figure out as we watch the film which guy is going to end up being the groom. The picture on the front of the video box has already showed us a bride being kissed from one side by Schwimmer and simultaneously from the other by Lee so we know the race for romance is going to be between the two of them. (This release, with Dutch subtitles, has a different picture to the US video/ IMDb picture.)Yet in the first five minutes Linda the publisher tells us, not once, but twice that she introduced the bride and groom.  We cut to a flashback of her introducing the two of them to each other, just in case we still don't get it. Then within another five minutes Jay the writer (Lee) is introducing Sam, his editor (Avital) to Max the sports caster and general foul-mouthed ignoramus (Schwimmer). IF the publisher is telling us the truth, doesn't this just kinda rule Max out of the contest for the first person to kiss the bride? Or have I missed something here?This film is about as predictable as trying to guess which kind of white meat will feature most often on Thanksgiving dinner tables this year. I'll tell you; it will be turkey. And this movie sure is one.But it is not just the plot and direction that are hugely lacking. Schwimmer is totally unbelievable and badly miscast as Max. His mouth moves, the words come out, but they lack any conviction whatsoever. The character of Jay the writer is such a whiney loser (with possibly the worst hairstyle in recent movie history) that I began to dread every screen appearance he made. He seemed to communicate in a series of whinging questions What are you doing here? So what?? And?? I have absolutely no idea why the two of them were friends; they had nothing in common and were always bitching at each other. The script was very weak in places Jay's explanation of why he had introduced Max to Sam provoked for me the biggest guffaw of the film (one of the very few). Best part of the film? The Harry Connick Jr. song over the opening credits.Overall, it gets a 3; a waste of my time and money - it was I who was the FOOL for not reading Roger Ebert's review BEFORE going to the video shop. If you are looking for a nice romantic comedy get While You Were Sleeping, The Philadelphia Story, As Good As It Gets or anything else on the IMDb list of top 50 Romance films.

Kissing A Fool wants to be too many things. Can you mix successful ingredients and get the best of every world? Kissing... tries to be a '40's-style romantic comedy, a modern sex comedy and a sit-com at the same time.Co-writer/Director Doug Ellin is a friend of Schwimmer's and Schwimmer has gone on and on about exactly how great it feels to shed his Ross-image and play the complete anti-Ross. Jason Lee stars as Jay Murphy, a sensitive nice guy who's a romance novelist and is recovering from his latest breakup with a model named Natasha (played by TV's Weird Science Vanessa Angel). He has a sweet boy-next-door demeanor about him and his real problem is he's too nice and sensitive for his own good. The worst part about being sensitive is that the world is so full of crap and garbage, people are such assholes that your feelings get hurt too often, too easy, too much. Better to be as cruel as the world or even more so and give worse than you get. Believe me, I know of what I speak of. David Schwimmer co-stars as Jay's best friend Max Abbitt, a sportscaster who's a womanizer who plays the field more than the teams reports on. A total creep and always with a dumb expression of his face, a self-satisfied drawl and his own cool-guy salutation What' up? Always a toothpick and a too cool drawl dangling from his lip. Mili Avital is unfortunately given the second-to-weakest developed character in the whole film. She's sweet, perky and photogenic... but nothing else, really. She and Lee could have some great chemistry if only the film allowed it. But this movie is written in a way that's so made-to-order, it's embarrassing. Bonnie Hunt plays the narrator that is publishing Lee's book. She's also the narrator. Why does this movie need a narrator? The narration actually manages to make the movie even less suspenseful, if that's possible. And Vanessa Angel, who broke through in TV's Weird Science and almost stole Kingpin, is given the least interesting character. She plays a model and Jay's heartless ex-girlfriend who has dumped him and left him a pathetic neurotic mess. Hers is not a character, but a plot device. The heartless bitch who is so cruel and horrible to the sweet-hearted hero so more of our sympathy goes to him. I groaned at her scenes. The movie's dialog is not always plot-driven or cutesy-poo, like most romantic comedies are (although sometimes it is). Most of the script is written in an observational sit-com kind of way. Like Seinfeld or Mad About You (or yes, even Friends). But the dramatic/romantic scenes are embarrassingly maudlin. Is it just me or is the entire cast of Friends been trying to mimic Kevin Smith?* The Object of My Affection * Kissing A Fool * Three To Tango Smith's groundbreaking romantic comedy Chasing Amy was revolutionary, insightful... and made big waves for Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Lee and Smith himself. A romantic comedy, a sex comedy and a relationship story. Not merely a love story, but a life story. Lately, Hollywood has been trying to make Smith-like slick Hollywood movies. So far, they failed terribly. Smith's movies are great because they are daring and avoid formulas. And they master the art of sparkling conversation. This film does neither. Nor do any of the other Kevin Smith-wannabes. Lee's character has been through the ringer and things are looking bleaker. I really liked him here and felt for him. And identified with him more than I wanted to.I knew guys like Max in high school, but in the outside world? Who knows? I was kind of like the Lee character myself. In a way, I still am. Too sensitive. Too easily vulnerable. Such a whipping boy. I did understand what Jay meant when he said, You know, I wish I had your heart. Then I wouldn't have spent so many sleepless nights.... The plot seems cruel and creepy, yet too sit-com-like at the same time. Test my fianc√©e''s fidelity? Almost seems like a sick ploy to throw Jay & Samantha together, doesn't it? Oh wait, it is...Anyone who has ever seen a movie will know what the ending will be. It's almost like waiting for the coyote to fall off the cliff. Schwimmer's Max Abbit character seems to dumb and dull and annoying to be interesting. He must be sick of playing the same type (The Pallbearer, Six Days, Seven Nights and TV's Friends), but this movie will do nothing for him. Still, at least he tried. I kept (back in 1999 when I first saw this movie) seeing a mad Ross trying to be bad whenever I looked at him, but now looking back on it and putting Ross out of my head (I really dislike the show anyway), Schwimmer does an effective job... however he doesn't really have dimensions and depth. He's just not an interesting womanizer. Apparently, a lot of Schwimmer fans felt confused by his role here. It feels like Schwimmer wants to play someone completely different without risking losing his hard-core audience. Schwimmer does do a much better job breaking typecasting in the forgettable Since You've Been Gone and the memorable Band of Brothers.MEMO TO Hollywood If you're gonna keep making bad Kevin Smith-knockoffs, at lest quit putting Friends actors in them.--Kissing Off This One, Dane Youssef "},{"Title":"Fairly entertaining.","Date":"3 February 2007","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" I didn't have expectations for this one.

Obviously Schwimmer isn't ready to settle down so he enlists Lee to hang around Avital to see whether she would cheat on him. Doug Ellin directs the material like a sitcom. All three principal actors are drenched in predictable formula that reduces them to idiots. Lee is totally reduced to cardboard, and Schwimmer overacts from the moment he first appears on screen. Avital deserves better, and Bonnie Hunt throws in a one-liner or two as narrator but otherwise she is just the bearer of bad news, which is the screenplay.

Filmmakers and studios are driven mad by audiences who embrace crap and turn their nose up at something good. Even given this difficult uncertainty, there's no excuse for the litany of plainly obvious mistakes and misjudgments of Kissing a Fool. The things that are wrong with this motion picture are so glaringly wrong that it is inconceivable how no one noticed them. This sort of fiasco doesn't just get people fired, it should actually end careers.The plot here is almost as old as fiction itself. A guy falls in love with his best friend's fianc√©e. The guy in this instance is Jay (Jason Lee), a passive mope who is still devastated after being dumped by his ex-girlfriend and is writing a novel about the miserable experience. His best friend is Max (David Schwimmer), a Chicago sportscaster and all around hound dog who, of course, is the exact opposite of Jay in every way. The fianc√©e is Sam (Mili Avitai), the editor of Jay's book. Jay introduces Sam to Max, they fall instantly into love, move in together and start talking marriage.Let me stop with the plot and explain how this movie goes into the crapper right away and never gets out. First, it opens with Sam getting married to somebody but we can't see who. We're then introduced to Linda (Bonnie Hunt) who claims to have introduced the newlyweds and proceeds to explain how they got together to a couple of fellow wedding guests, essentially narrating the story as it appears in flashbacks. The whole point of this structure is to create a mystery as to whether Sam ends up with Max or Jay. Yet before you realize there's supposed to be a mystery, Linda says she introduced the newlyweds and then we see her introducing Jay and Sam. So, anyone with half a brain has to assume that Jay and Sam are the ones who got married and absolutely nothing, not even Max and Sam getting engaged, ever causes you to reconsider that assumption. There's never a single second when it seems like Sam might end up with anyone other than Jay, but the film still carries out the non-existent mystery until the very end.Secondly, Jason Lee is playing the sympathetic guy in a romantic triangle&#x85;and he has a unibrow. It's not an ordinary unibrow, either. It's one where his eyebrows not only meet but take sharp turns and crawl down the bridge of his nose. It's so hideous you can hardly even notice anything else when Lee is on screen. Lee isn't exactly a matin√©e idol to begin with and here he's made to look physically repellent.Those two blatant errors strangle Kissing a Fool in its crib. It wouldn't have mattered how good everything else was, it was doomed from the start by those two awful and inept creative choices. And they're both such easily avoided problems. Simply have Linda say she knows the married couple instead of introduced them and there could have at least theoretically been a mystery. Pluck Lee's eyebrows every morning before shooting began and at least the audience wouldn't have been distracted by looking at Lee and expecting him to start strumming a banjo and squealing like a pig.It ultimately doesn't matter because the rest of the movie stinks on ice. Apparently realizing they weren't talented enough to do anything with the old two people are perfect for each other but neither wants to betray a third person shtick, they add in a twist that sounds like something Aaron Sorkin would have resorted to if Sports Night has lasted another season or two. Max wants to test the fidelity of his fianc√©e, so he asks Jay to see if he can get Sam to want to sleep with him. The filmmakers also include an appearance by Jay's horrible ex-girlfriend and give Max an ex-girlfriend he's constantly hanging around with for no explicable reason. They even throw in a female cousin (Judy Greer) visiting Sam and staying at her house, as though giving each main character an annoying chick to deal with somehow made it funny.Compounding the suck is that Max is a far more interesting and dynamic than Jay and also happens to be the one who pushes the narrative along. When the third wheel of your romantic triangle is the most proactive character in the film, that's a problem.Bonnie Hunt and David Schwimmer are both quite good here, particularly Schwimmer, who demonstrates the comedic skills that could have led him to an entirely different career if he hadn't been cemented in the public's mind as Ross from Friends.Kissing a Fool is a misconceived mistake that people should have seen coming a mile away. Unless you have a thing for guys with unibrows, don't bother watching it.

And I liked Bonnie Hunt as the story's narrator. But the film suffers from a plot that is too predictable and from characters whose behavior is not believable.This is one of those movies that you can see the end coming a mile away. There are virtually no plot twists to deflect the story's straight-line trajectory. As such, the story is almost too simple and unimaginative to be worth telling. To varying degrees, most romantic comedies are fairly shallow. But Kissing A Fool has no subtlety at all, not in plot, not in characters, not in dialogue.Lacking any complexity, the story relies on two main characters, Jay (Jason Lee) and Max (David Schwimmer) whose behavior toward each other is not believable. They're supposed to be best buddies. But they are constantly at each other's throats. Their constant arguing not only is annoying; it calls into question their friendship. How can they be best buddies?The two are not at all alike. Jay is bookish and cerebral; Max is your typical arrogant, cocky self-centered sports freak jerk. All that animosity between these two guys does not lend credibility to their friendship; yet, it is the main contrivance that propels the film's plot. Further, it renders a story conclusion that is, by extension, also not believable.The film's acting is a tad exaggerated. I like Jason Lee, but he tends to overact in this film. Mili Avital, as the girl in between, is okay, but she doesn't have much to do. And David Schwimmer's performance is something of a hyper-masculine strut-fest. Some subtlety in acting would have helped a lot.For all that, Kissing A Fool is still worth watching, once. It has credible production values, and there are occasional lines of dialogue that are funny. And I think the film's underlying concept is fine. I just wish the script and the acting could have been a little more nuanced and subtle.

This is not a movie where Schwimmer is supposed to be some hot piece of meat, or where you should expect to be rolling in the aisles, laughing.It is the shallow and inconsiderate vs. the deep and meaningful.  Max is a fickle, self-involved guy, open to any avenue his libido directs him to, concerned only with his own satisfaction.  Oddly enough, this is usually the type of guy most women find appealing on a surface-level-only type of relationship, and Schwimmer plays the part very believably.Jay is more of a thinker, analyzing all possible outcomes before proceeding, careful and cautious and unwilling to purposely hurt someone.  Lee is quite good at pulling this off, making you tense for him when you should be, worried and anxious.And Sam is the typical woman, satisfied by Man A on an intellectual level, thus falling for Man B without realizing where the initial desire came from. In Max's statements you can hear Sam's awareness coming around, She thinks we're running out of things to talk about.The most defining moment in the movie is when Jay meets Max at The Green Mill, and Dara blows Jay off as the most unimportant person in the world. Here we have two supremely shallow and pointless people feeling superior to someone who is infinitely more intelligent and valuable in every sense.End result?  Yet another wonderful display of the differences between those who care and those who simply pretend to care, those who love and those who grasp love like a brass ring without ever understanding its nuances.  And especially, a very nice and yet extremely subtle description of the surface dwellers vs. those with substance. "}{"Title":"Surprise!

His friend, Jay, played by former pro skateboarder Jason Lee, introduces him to Sam, played by Israel native Mili Avital. Max and Sam seem perfect for each other. But Max wonders if he can really keep Sam satisfied long-term and tries to get Jay to see if she can become unfaithful.  Sam and Jay have to work together on a writing project, and in the end they begin to realize they are right for each other, and Max realizes it also, and finds out some things about his personal growth. Overall a very simple and often told story, but done so in an enjoyable way. I especially liked Jason Lee's performance. I also saw him in Mumford and he was very good in that. He is a 'natural.'

I mean this movie is all about Jason Lee, he is great in this film.  It also shows that he can play a different role then the characters he has played in Kevin Smith films.  If you like Jason Lee watch this movie.

Myself, I loved it. Jason Lee is a great actor who should be noticed more. Milli Avital is gorgeous, and a good actress, but the real star of this is David Schwimmer. I was actually surprised at the amount of swearing coming from his mouth, but after a while I got used to it. His character is obnoxious, but at the same time, interesting. The story is about as twisted as you can get. Recent husband to be Max(schwimmer) is a womanising Sports presenter on television who asks his best friend Jay(lee) to check to see if recent wife to be is a cheater or not. Things are complicated, however, when Jay falls in love with her. Schwimmer is amazing. Not only does he get rid of the Ross shadow on Friends, but also manages to plunge straight into a decent film. Rating=4/5 "},{"Title":"terribly underrated","Date":"29 April 1999","Score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This was a sweetheart of a movie.  From a technical point of view, the photography was just right for the moments.  If anyone has ever dismissed David Schwimmer as a pouty, whiny lout (such the characters from FRIENDS and The Pallbearer), take a good look at his Max in this and you'll see the complete opposite.  Max is a vulgar, arrogant, misogynistic , bitter ass.  His fellow player, Jason Lee, plays a pouty, whiny lout (as opposed to the vulgar, arrogant, misogynistic, bitter roles he was made famous by, in Brodie Bruce and Banky Edwards) who, as probably already told to you here on IMDb, is lorn of his slutty model girlfriend.  Max has fallen for Sam, his attractive young publisher who he feels is too good to be true.  So, he asks his best friend Jay (Lee) to see if Sam will hit on him, thus figuring out if she is the one.  This test of course, is a thin veiled attempt to breach the contract called commitment, which blah blah blah, the story ends rather nicely.  Not really what you expect.  The flaw of this film is the forced conflicts presented, the rushed and implausible sequences that appear all too soon, and the unnecessary characters.BUT I URGE YOU ALL READING THIS  GO RENT KISSING A FOOL!  It, despite a few cons, is the kind of romantic comedy you hope for when you stand in line for You've Got Mail and get crap.  Quirky, metropolitan, pampered, and concise, this flick will hit the spot, man.

Not many people have seen this and the reactions to it are mixed.  There are some parts with really great narrative and the story moves along quite fluidly.  The characters are over the top and make for a very fun movie (Max, Natasha etc.).By no means one of the great films or anything, but definitely one of my favs for sure.

But Kissing a Fool is fabulous.  Like previously stated, Bonnie Hunt and Jason Lee are so talented and funny.  Jason is completely beleivable in his role and makes everything feel so human.  The scenes where he reunites with ex- Natasha (natasia) are so perfect and funny.  For anyone who has ever been in a complicated relationship, or anyone who has been jilted by a bad romantic comedy before, see this movie.  Just rent it on a night when you don't want something heavy.  It's pretty good.

The movie has a great script and a brilliant cast, including, the fantastic Mili Avital (One of my favourite actress'. She's destined to go far.) and David Schwimmer who are both brilliant here. (I think it's great that they're both together in 'real-life.' (And engaged too.)) I shouldn't really forget, Jason Lee who is also good here. If you haven't seen, Kissing A Fool, then I'd really advise you too. Like I've said many times, it sure is brilliant and I give it a well deserving 10/10.

And I am so glad I did. The actors did a great job and I am surprised you only hear so little about them (beside David Schwimmer). David was cast totally against his Ross character from Friends and I think he pulled it off very well. The actors who portrayed Jay, Sam and Andrea were very good, too. The story is told in flashbacks to a really funny couple and there is some great dialogue in this one. A really pleasant surprise, give it a try! "}]
