It's actually quite interesting, and has some good action sequences. The plot is pretty interesting, and moves along very nicely, quickly moving on, constantly developing. The acting was convincing enough, there wasn't really any scenes that were terrible, even though a lot of the scenes and lines were very corny; it fit perfectly in with the movie, and as such wasn't out of place. It's pretty much a B-movie, but if you like(or just enjoy mildly) B-movies, you'll probably be at least reasonably entertained by it. It's reminiscent of movies like Fortress, but just a little better in that it's very unpredictable; no matter what you think is gonna happen, you'll be surprised again and again by what happens. It's pretty interesting all the way through, it has some good, 80's style action, corny B-movie lines, a B-movie feel throughout the movie... so, if you can watch it for free, either borrow it from a friend, or watch it on TV... if not, only watch it if you're into movies like Fortress. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Underrated Prison Action","Date":"15 December 2004","Score":"31 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" On the surface, 'No Escape' is just another generic action movie set in a prison environment.

If only there were more movies of this type. I guess, it's like this typical pulp-sci-fi thriller. The effects are not very impressive but it has a kind of post-80s look to it. This was before CGI became normal. I think this movie is going to prove especially satisfying to fans of adventure movies such as Conan and to sci-fi fans who likes movies such as Planet of the Apes.

Back when big stars were still appearing in incredibly violent action movies and when over-anxious kids like myself had to secretly sneak into cinemas because you weren't allowed to see these movies under the age of 16. Escape from Absolom is a childhood favorite of mine, so my views and opinions may be a bit biased, but still I think they don't make action flicks like this one anymore nowadays. The script may perhaps contain a few gigantic holes and completely illogic twists, but at least it's continuously fast-paced, politically incorrect and spectacular. The year's 2022 and prisons have turned into private companies without government interference. Absolom is the name of a prison colony island where the sadistic warden (Michael Lerner) plays off the Outsiders against the Insiders. The former are an unorganized bunch of savages wearing masks and hunting with primitive weapons, led by the relentless but charismatic Walter Marek. The Insiders, however, attempted to found a peaceful community where they grow crops and seek for moral redemption. The newly arrived and military trained prisoner Robbins would make a great asset for the Insiders, since he's the only one to have ever escaped from the Outsiders, but he's stubborn and anti-social and solely intends to get off the island alone. The concept of Escape from Absolom is very reminiscent to copious other (futuristic) prison movies, like Fortress, Papillon, Blood Camp Thatcher, Escape from NY &#133;, but this one definitely benefices from good production values, staggering filming locations, a devoted cast and the professional direction of Martin Campbell. The battle sequences as well as the violent ordeals Robbins meets in the Outsiders' camp are robust and grisly, including a lot of decapitations and swashbuckling. The high tempo and adrenalin-level is only occasionally overshadowed by overly sentimental biographies and redundant flashbacks. Obviously in a prison colony, everybody has a story to tell about why he ended up there and the film tells too many of them. Ray Liotta's character is an interesting anti-hero, since he remains unreliable and somewhat aloof. The most fascinating character is undoubtedly Walter Merak. He's an insane and power-obsessed dictator with menacing facial expressions and a deranged sense of humor. Merak also narrates R-rated versions of Goldilocks and the Three Bears and eliminates the members of his own parliament to gain even more power. It's a stupendous performance from Stuart Wilson; an actor whose other works I'm not really familiar with. The always reliable Lance Henriksen, Ernie Hudson, Kevin J. O'Connor and Ian McNeice deliver awesome roles in the supportive cast. Granted, the movie is far from flawless and the sudden ending is a bit stupid and implausible, but Escape from Absolom nevertheless remains one of the highlights of early 90's Sci-Fi/action cinema.

He does not stay there for long however, as he is banished to 'Absolum' a monitored island in a guarded stretch of water. Here, prisoners are no longer really prisoners, as there are no rules, no bars, no guards, just you and them. By them I mean the outsiders, a bunch of savages desperately struggling for survival under the leadership of the vicious dread-locked Walter Marrik (Wilson).Then there are the insiders, a society of former and somewhat rehabilitated inmates who live a peaceful and structured life, in a makeshift but well guarded fortress. They live under rules and respect each other, unlike the feral outsiders who have no code of honour.Classic lines, likable characters and solid action make this a film in its own right.

The idea is that isolated from civilisation, people become like animals. This is partially true in this movie but moreso it seems to fall apart when we see one group of people who are developing their own civilisation. Still, this is similar to Lord of the Flies were one group became savage and hostile, while the others tried to become more civilised.This movie, though, is based on another book The Penal Colony by Richard Herley and supposedly it is supposed to be a critique on the prison system. In the film, the prisons are supposed to be money making corporations where prisoners assigned there are reduced to slave labour. Basically there is a hierarchy, and the island Absolom is at the top. Prisoners who prove to be too troublesome to turn into slave labourers are banished to the island and are left to fend for themselves. The prison is nice to drop in small amounts of food, but most of the time the inhabitants must scrounge for themselves.If this is supposed to be a critique on the prison system, there seems to be a huge lack of it. What I saw in this movie was a treatise on the savagery of humanity, and the warden is actively trying to encourage the savagery. If they are civilised then they might turn against him, so if they are busy fighting, then all the better. The weird thing I noticed, is that the warden personally came to the island to deal with the problem. Thus he was sticking his neck out in a way that was purely illogical. It seemed to be an excuse to get him there to kill him.

Liotta, a disgraced special ops, doesn't care about either faction, he just wants off the island. And while he waits to get off the island, he fights. Liotta may seem an unlikely action hero, but being a terrific actor, we never once doubt his ability to defend himself and make bloody mincemeat of his enemies. Wilson makes for a loud, pop-eyed killer and literal eater of men while Liotta is a quiet but extremely deadly individual. They make for an interesting match at the end.

He may be a convicted murderer, but he did it for just motives, therefore we can root for him.

It bloody works!I first saw this film when it was released on a straight-to-video premise way back in 1994 as a Sunday night filler, and to be honest I couldn't remember much about it, except that it wasn't that bad, but nor was it memorable. Twenty years on, I managed to grab a copy of it again, and finally forced myself to sit through what I anticipated to be an excruciatingly painful event, as I'm just not a great fan of Ray Liotta or Kevin Dillon to say the least, and what with time being so cruel and all, I expected the cheesiest of cheese. How wrong I was! This gem appears to have magically grown better with time! So yeah it's a bit corny in parts, and the overall plot only SEEMS to be kinda predictable, but there's many an unexpected twist and turn to keep the story moving at an extremely entertaining pace, with some fantastic camera work reminiscent of 'Predator', and some great one-liners to boot.Knowing that this was pretty much a mash-up of previous classic movies didn't leave a sour taste at all, and I'd watch it again in an instant. Bloody good entertainment, surprisingly minimal on the profanities, (I think I heard only one quickly blurted F-word expletive from Marek throughout), and highly recommended for those 80's/90's action genre buffs.A generous and solid 8/10 for overall value and stamina.

This is your typical mid-90's action B-film that lacks the brains, but certainly not the brawn. I enjoyed this film very much for what it is and I came away with a smile on my face. It's obvious that the actors were having fun and were giving it all they got. Yes, the special effects may not be the best, but I'm not complaining.Martin Campbell's film is set in the near future and we meet a former Marine named John Robbins who is sent to life imprisonment because he murdered his commanding officer. He is sent by the Warden to an island full of savages and now it's his goal to escape without being killed.The acting was pretty good for the kind of film it is. The actors were definitely having a fun time with the film. Ray Liotta is a great, underrated actor. I liked seeing some B-name stars like Lance Henriksen, Stuart Wilson, and Ernie Hudson. They really add to the campy, fun feel of the film.Overall, this is a good film that is good to watch on any weekend or when you're not in a serious film-watching mood. I would just shut my brains off and enjoy the film as it is, rather than picking it apart like people like to do. This is a fun film and that's all it is. It's full of crazy action, stunts, some mild humor, and some cool sci-fi. I rate this film 9/10.

I have two issues with this.1) some cons appear too incredibly tame to warrant expulsion to the island. It's not made clear whether some, all, or who exactly gets chosen to be moved from the prison to the island2) Assuming all the criminals are likely to be reassigned to other prisons once the truth about the island comes out, why would the good guys, who've actually constructed quite a nice island compound, want to give up their freedom in this manner?

Auteur theory purists would have you believe that the team here was purely one-sided (in Cameron's favour), but this little gem shows otherwise. Hurd was (and still is) an excellent producer, and had she been involved, Titanic would have been a much better film. Anyways, I digress. As Hurd's first post T2 project (and first without Cameron), this has an awful lot of the trademark style that bore fruit in T1, Aliens, The Abyss, and T2, not to mention the participation of Lance Henriksen. At first I thought that Ray Liotta was miscast, but while his performance takes a while to get going, eventually it works well for the film. Also in exceptional form here are Kevin Dillon (annoying as hell, but he's supposed to be) and Ernie Hudson. But the real treat is the over-the top performance of Stuart Wilson, who gives us a glimpse of what Alan Rickman's performance could have been in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves had they banned Kevin Costner from the editing room. Martin Campbell proves himself to be an excellent action director, and I have no doubt that this served as an excellent calling card when he got the directing jobs on GoldenEye and The Mask of Zorro. I, for one, am looking forward to his next project, Vertical Limit, but would also love to see him work with Hurd again; maybe next time they'll produce a really big hit.

This futuristic film leaves little doubt that if a private warden takes the helm of one of these prisons, things are apt to get out of hand. From an audiences' perspective, we can expect a lot from whomever Hollywood chooses as their main star. In this offering, we have impressive Ray Liotta as Capt. J.T. Robbins, a disgraced Special Forces soldier, who's been court martialed and sent to prison for the murder of his commanding officer. However, the Warden of the prison (Michael Lerner, who is almost believably sadistic) decides to ratchet up his punishment by sending him to ' Absolom' a maximum island prison where life is shortened by the extreme brutality allowed. Here Robbins, meets Walter Marek, a brutal prisoner who leads his 'outsiders' with savage force and who tries to force Robbins to submit to his authority which leads to their jungle confrontation. Robbins also meets 'The Father' (Lance Henriksen) the leader of other convicts living apart in a special compound and who've accepted their punishment, but wish to do their time in peace and companionship. Ernie Hudson plays Hawkins, the security officer for their compound. The action/drama is slow to build, but explodes when it does. Plenty of mayhem follows and through some of the sub-plots a forceful and violent movie appears. A good film for Liotta and Hadson and it's ending is surprisingly unexpected. **** "},{"Title":"A very underrated film.","Date":"10 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" I often think that a large segment of the population tunes out whenever they hear the word (or phrase) sci-fi.

Within that island, a dominant chief (Stuart Wilson) has formed a twisted.  In opposition to his brutality, a minority has broken away as 'freedom fighters' of an ilk. The environment of the island is the highlight of the No Escape.  The flora is lush; the costumes are natural and rugged; the look of the prisoners is fitting.  Unfortunately, not enough history of the island is provided.  Rather than explain how the prison came into existence, the movie simply presents it as fact without exposition.  Some movies have too much backstory, but this one needed more.  Stuart Wilson as Merak is the undisputed highlight of the cast.  He gleefully oozes evil confidence throughout the movie, appearing to know that his situation borders on ludicrous.  Ray Liotta is slightly above servicable as the action hero; he brings more cerebral qualities to the role, but in a part that requires a little bit of thinking, that works.  Everyone else is adequate, providing what the role asks and not much more.  Everyone except Kevin Dillon that is.  He whines throughout the entire movie and serves little to no purpose.  When he meets his fate, it's a relief, not a disappointment.  The storyline is typical.

Ray Liotta snuffed his post GOODFELLAS career by accepting the role of Mr. Robbins, a man with a quest to rid the world of corruption and injustice by shooting a superior officer during a drill review for a Haliburton like future armed forces. He is sent to the movie's Devil's Island, a wasteland south seas location where violently dangerous political prisoners are sent to be eaten by the Outsiders, a MAD MAX styled group of prisoners bonded together by their will to do evil. I know the intentions of the filmmakers was to portray Lance Henrikson's Family group as the good guys, but frankly they looked like a bunch of monks. The bad guys have all the fun in this movie, as evidenced by the outrageous scene where the leader of The Outsiders (Stuart Wilson, who deserves lifetime free beer for agreeing to be in this movie) tosses the severed heads of his opposition party delegates aside with a joke about having just one head from now on.How shall I put this ... the movie is derivative and self-important. We have excellent, brutal scenes of action countered by quiet, soul searching discussions where various characters discuss the human condition with Lance Henrikson while trying to look sensitive but not gay. The Outsiders all dress like Kiss and live to hack apart anything that isn't part of their sect. Meanwhile, it turns out that not only is Ray Liotta a Universal Soldier who can kick anybody's ass on the island, but he is also MacGuyver and helps the good people advance their plot to get off the island, which turns not to be a plot to get off the island at all but just a way to give everyone a chance to all get along. Aww.The movie rips off PAPILLION, SPARTACUS, a hundred Italian Peplum movies, DELIVERANCE, THE EMERALD FOREST, ROBOCOP (yes, ROBOCOP) and every other big budget high tech action film or survivalist yarn that came before it. The film counters brutality with understanding and tries desperately to be inclusive, with minority members of each tribe and even a couple of fat guys. One interesting note is the complete absence of any homosexual subtext beyond a crass line about Liotta's little bunk boy Kevin Dillon With what, 2000 guys all shackled together on a deserted, woman-less island in the middle of nowhere that are encouraged to revert back to an atavistic animal like state, not one of them ever drops the soap? Nonsense. Put men of any character in such surroundings and they will start to have relations -- not because they are gay, but because if there are no women to be had a certain percentage will inevitably have each other. Sadly the movie was made at the height of the AIDS epidemic, which combined with the rampant hypocritical homophobia of pre-BROKEBACK Hollywood meant no gay survivalist scenes. Too bad it would have loaned a touch of realism to the village sets of perfect huts, which have as much realism as the supply hut from Gilligan's Island.I refuse to believe that none of the population succumbs to those inclinations of our human nature within some of us to have sex with whatever is handy, and also refuse to believe that Ray Liotta and his outrage at having been duped into committing a war crime can bring down a global hegemony. But this movie asks us to believe it, and paints a convincing backdrop onto which the events are projected. If they had a whiff of originality or substance to them I might be willing to buy into it, but unless you are about 14 (in which you should be too young to watch this gory R-rated film) and never seen a big budget action adventure film before this movie will seem strangely familiar, rather hokey, and much longer than it's stated duration.Nice sets though somebody must have dug up those old plans from Gilligan's Island for the village design.3/10 "}{"Title":"NO ESCAPE (DIDIER BECU)","Date":"14 April 2004","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Martin Campbell is the kind of director who should know better, he made Goldeneye so why he ever gave us crap like The mask of Zorro or this pathetic No escape is beyond me.

The heroes of the piece are able to muster crossbows and catapults, or build a boat with devices designed to spoof heat sensors, but an early dialogue seems to imply that they can't make use of the most crude antiseptic potions.The smoke effect during the moment when the escape boat is destroyed would have to qualify as one of the funniest bad effects since an inauspicious shot in the original V miniseries. Luckily, the computer screens appear to have been done by other means than smearing ash on the negative, but most of the shots don't really require anything more than rudimentary trick photography.In Australia, there has been some fuss over what aspect ratio this film was intended to be shown in. The American DVD has an aspect ratio of about 2.301, while the Australian disc is framed at 1.781, which would be a problem if it weren't for the cinematography. If people hold Sergio Leone as the man who framed the best widescreen shots, Martin Campbell would be among the most uninteresting on the basis of this film. If the intended framing is indeed the wider ratio, the extra quarter or so would seem to be rather superfluous.The story is rather flat and uninteresting at best. A sort of Mad Max meets Lord Of The Flies meets Fortress concept that never seems to make up its mind exactly whether to focus upon the conflict between the tribes or the injustice of the tyrants who put them on the island. There are no real compelling reasons to want any of the players to defeat any of the others. Without an emotional investment in any of the characters, the film quickly becomes flat and uninteresting. The main bad guys, the people running the island, in particular feel like an unresolved tangent.Nonetheless, the few action sequences are well-planned and don't waste any time, which is something you'd expect from the man who went on to direct GoldenEye, arguably the best Bond film ever made, the next year. Lance Henriksen steals the show as a bizarre kind of father figure not too far removed from Michael Preston's in Mad Max 2. Ernie Hudson provides a good friendly face among the support cast. I'm surprised this man doesn't get more appearances in better films, as he is certainly a better choice for the African father-figure type of role than Laurence Fishburne has proved to be.In all, I gave No Escape, or Escape From Absolom as it is known on several markets outside of the USA, a five out of ten. Most will watch it once and forget it. After that, the disc is best returned to the nearest rental outlet, or used as a coaster.

There is truly no escape from the utter tedium of this pointless drivel. In the future, prisoners will be made to watch this film as their ultimate punishment. I am only sorry that zero is not a rating option.

Somebody else paid for me to see it at a $.99 theater and I wish that I still had that time back.The action sucks.  The characters are boring.  The scenery is boring.  The plot is trivial, hackneyed, and ill-conceived.  The acting is wooden.Avoid it at all costs.  "}]
