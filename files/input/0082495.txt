I have to say right away here that I was scared in this movie.  There are some truly ingenious and horrific shots in this film.  There are times when you really aren't expecting what's about to transpire, and when it does, it sends chills through you.I first saw this film in my  horror  days in the mid 80's.  I was 12 years old then.  So I just recently watched it again to see if it would have the same affect on me now.  I sat in my basement and turned off all the lights and you know what, I was spooked.  Right from the opening number of Carpenter's ominous music and the pumpkin slowly transforming into Michael's angry face, I knew right there that I was in for a night of fear.  And I was.The story starts the same night as Halloween ended on.  Laurie is being taken to the hospital and there is a massive manhunt to find Myers. Laurie eventually gets settled into the hospital and it becomes only a matter of time until Michael can find out where she is.  He finally comes to get her and then all hell breaks loose.One of the major players in this film is the locale.  The hospital is dark and quiet and rather empty.  And that adds to the atmosphere of the film. It gives us lots of long hallways so we can have a few shots of Michael hunting his prey.  What we also get is an array of rooms to 86 his victims in and a slew of weapons to do it with.Rick Rosenthal directed this film and I am amazed that he really didn't go on to do much because he almost copies Carpenter's style to the tee here. Brilliant in particular are two shots.  One is where Michael appears out of the darkness in one room to attack his victim.  The lighting is solely responsible for the affectiveness of this shot and it works so well that it still gives me the shivers when I watch it.  The second is when Micael attacks one of the nurses while Laurie watched helplessly from a distance.Not only is this a good horror movie, it is a good film and if the first rates a 10/10, this is certainly of a 9.  It is that good.  And if you don't agree with me, watch it again---by yourself and then answer that question.

Hence the Halloween series. We do have quite a bit of horror movie sequels the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, Scream, and so on. Most sequels are extremely cheesy and don't deliver the same scares as the original movie does, but the Halloween franchise is a different story, I think these sequels were always a ton of fun and delivered just as many scares. Nothing will ever compare to the original Halloween, but it was cool to see the story continue on Michael Myers. In this story we follow Laurie Strode to the hospital and Michael doesn't just give up that easily, he's on a mission.After the film replays the last scene of Halloween, it moves on to Dr. Sam Loomis warning Sheriff Leigh Brackett that although he has shot Myers six times in the heart, Myers still lives. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital and Myers wanders around Haddonfield in search of her. Laurie is informed that the man who attacked her was Michael Myers, infamous for murdering his older sister fifteen years earlier on Halloween night. After this, Laurie drifts in and out of consciousness, having strange flashbacks about her adoption by the Strodes and visiting a boy in an institution. Myers learns that she is at the hospital. He goes there and murders the hospital's staff one by one. Laurie manages to elude him, but she is limping badly and sedated and is thus unable to move very quickly. Dr. Loomis and the Haddonfield police continue to search the town for Myers. Nurse Marion Chambers, Loomis' assistant, arrives and tells Loomis that she has discovered a secret file on Myers to which he was not privy. The file reveals that Laurie is actually Myers's sister, adopted by the Strodes after Myers killed his older sister, Judith. Chambers also informs Loomis that he has strict orders to return to Smith's Grove. So they have to get back to the hospital to save Laurie before Michael can get to her.Halloween 2 is probably my second favorite sequel in the Halloween franchise next to H20. I can't tell you how creepy this movie was, I know that these sequels are a bit much, but for any horror movie fan, they are a ton of fun to get into. The whole hospital setting was really scary, I love Laurie Strode, she's the strongest female in a horror movie, she's in a weakened state but just keeps going. You have to love the return of Dr. Loomis, him helping Laurie and making sure that Michael goes away for good, well we clearly know that it's not going to happen, but you have to give him credit for his optimism. If you are going to watch a Halloween sequel, I do recommend Halloween 2, it's very creepy and a great addition to the story.7/10 "},{"Title":"A solid sequel","Date":"23 March 2006","Score":"29 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Halloween 2 seems to get mixed reactions but no one can deny that it stands alone as a great slasher film. Of course it's hard to take Halloween 2 as its own film compared to the greatness that is the original Halloween, but most should be able to overlook that and enjoy it for what it is. Halloween 2 uses the suspense of Halloween but adds more gore and a faster pace to the mix. I found it thoroughly entertaining, with some great death scenes and genuinely suspenseful moments (Jamie-Lee escaping through the ventilation grill). The only minor points spoiling Halloween 2 are that sometimes it gets a bit far-fetched. For example, Jamie-Lee is escaping through the ventilation grill and Michael Myers takes an eternity to simply walk over and pull her back down. There were also a few moments of very bad acting. Overall though it's thoroughly entertaining and I would recommend it to all horror fans. It doesn't ruin the integrity of the original film like most sequels do.

If you remember the post I made many months ago, I promised to review many older horror films and their contemporary versions. I always planned to include Halloween II as part of this series. This entry would have appeared anyway, but the psychological aspect of posting on October 31 would have been worthwhile. Oh well, I'll also review Halloween III Season of the Witch since a sequel to the new film will be released next year.In the surprisingly long three years between Halloween and its sequel, the horror film market underwent a drastic change. The last remnants of literature-based horror films gave way to crazy people with weapons films. People rediscovered Black Christmas and ate up Halloween. The expected sequel to the original film is a genre film in this tradition. Is it a worthy follow-up? No, it isn't.The story takes place directly after the first film. Michael Myers survives six shots at point-blank range and has to find more young people to kill. His eternal and hitherto inexplicable nemesis, Laurie Strode, has been taken to Haddonfield Hospital to recover from her wounds. Michael goes there and kills nearly everyone until Dr. Loomis realizes where he is and kills him and himself in a fiery explosion.Everyone in Haddonfield who isn't Laurie Strode is a complete idiot. It takes them nearly the entire movie to determine where Myers could be. They even conduct a thorough investigation of Haddonfield sans hospital before they figure it out. The hospital staff is even worse. If you're someone involved in the medical field, don't watch this film. It equally insults everyone in your community. Doctors have nothing better to do than flirt with horny nurses who ignore infants to bathe with their suitors. Teenagers at least have the excuse of youth when they act stupid but not medical staff.By the way, since when have hospitals been so poorly lighted and serving so few patients? Rick Rosenthal attempts to recreate the sensation of Michael walking in Laurie's house from the first film without considering context. An empty house at night is much more frightening than an empty hospital at night. I'm aware that these films aren't intended to be fully realistic, but Halloween II is so stylized that I couldn't avoid feeling like I was watching a cartoon. The production feels more like a parody of the original than an actual continuation of story. In the first film, Michael Myers was a presence, something that wouldn't go away, like the monster under your bed. Laurie was the heroine. In Halloween II he is transformed into a protagonist who we have no reason to like. He's just there.The movie isn't scary either. Instead of suspenseful chases, Michael Myers disposes of victims violently and shows us lots of blood. Rick Rosenthal claims that it was John Carpenter's idea to add gore. Wikipedia has a link to a quote Carpenter made claiming it wasn't scary enough. Shame on you John Carpenter for not believing in the technique you used in the first film. Indeed, there are moments when Halloween II actually works like its predecessor. How nice it would be to see the film as Rosenthal intended. Maybe he will finally release his preferred version of the film sometime in 2010.Many people say critics didn't originally understand that slasher antagonists like Myers are actually the main characters. The whole first person perspective seems to support this idea. It's especially true in this entry. We see too much from Myers' view. Laurie, therefore, loses her hardiness and becomes a generic victim who should die but doesn't. How does she elude the Shape? Not like she does in the first film by actively refusing to die but by dumb luck. Only Dr. Loomis is able to maintain his composure as a complete character. These types of movies really are sexist, but not just in how they portray women. For their intended male audience, they subtly support male domination over women. The man could be a husband or a killer in a mask. If this is one of the better sequels to the classic, I'm going to have many bad horror movie filled Friday nights. "},{"Title":"Shallow Slasher Sequel Lacks Any Surprises","Date":"27 August 2009","Score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The sequel to John Carpenter's Halloween doesn't surpass the original. Freshman director Rick Rosenthal creates only a handful of suspenseful moments, but Halloween 2 suffers from a weak script that was unfortunately penned by Carpenter and co-producer Hill. Michael Myers gets up and walks away after Dr. Loomis bangs off six shots into him. We never learn what makes Michael such an unstoppable demon. In Halloween, Michael embodied a supernatural evil, but in Halloween 2 doesn't develop his character. No matter how many times people pump bullets into the guy, he just doesn't stay down for the count. The problem is Rosenthal's comatose direction. This chiller generates a body count but it doesn't generate horror. Instead, it becomes monotonous with Michael trudging into and out of scenes like a wraith. The action picks up where it left off in Halloween. Michael plunges into the yard, hard enough to leave an impression of his body, after Loomis opens fire on him. When Loomis goes to confirm his kill, he realizes to his horror that Michael has gotten up and vanished. Meanwhile, the paramedics haul Laurie off to the hospital. Futilely she pleads with them not to give her anything that will put her to sleep. Of course, the doctor ignores her request and administers an injection designed to knock her out. Although Laurie is deadly afraid of Michael and what he is capable of doing to her, Halloween 2 doesn't develop a strong sense of fear. The best scene finds a hospital guard investigating noises. When he opens a cabinet, an avalanche of items topples onto him. When he turns around, Michael is there waiting for him. Earlier, the guard had spotted blood in a trash dumpster and a shrieking black cat flew out at him. Everything else unfolds in a matter of fact fashion. Of course, Halloween 2 is just a mindless horror movie, but the idiocy gets out of hand. The movie lacks a sense of humor, much less a sense of irony. Michael himself doesn't speak, but he seems to know exactly what to do in every given situation and where to go. You cannot fool this bogyman. Sometimes, like in the hydro-therapy, you have to wonder if Carpenter and Hill aren't going a bit off the deep end. I mean, Michael holds the poor nurse's head under the scalding water, but the scorching water exerts no visible effect on him. When he casts the nurse aside, her face looks hideous. If this is supposed to show that Michael is invulnerable himself, then you have to wonder why Carpenter and Hill behave so inconsistently. Later, in the final confrontation in the hospital, Loomis blasts Michael multiple times again but the guy gets back up. Finally, when Laurie&#x97;who shouldn't even be able to climb out of bed&#x97;blows Michael's eyeballs out, the guy begins to behave like he is mortal. Clearly, Loomis should have shot Michael's feet to ribbons so that he couldn't walk. Imagine how much blood that this guy has lost after being shot&#x97;twelve times&#x97;but he displays virtually no signs of slowing down.Michael Myers is the equivalent of a Steven Seagal hero. He is indestructible until Loomis sacrifices his own life in the hospital and incinerates him. The end credits show us Michael burning to a crisp. The other thing that bothered me about this mute murderer who escaped from the asylum is his innovative ways of killing people. He stabs a surgeon in the eyeball with a pair of scissors. He buries a claw hammer into the guard's head. He drains the blood from a nurse. He guts another nurse on a scalpel and then hoists her so high in the air that her shoes fall out. Michael acts like he is a scenarist's puppet, killing people in imaginative ways rather than with his brute strength and knife. Another problem with Halloween 2 is the way that Rosenthal force feeds us exposition. The entire scene in the back of the sheriff's cruiser when the nurse informs Loomis that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is really Michael's baby sister and all the stuff about the sealed records struck me as too contrived and obvious. Mind you, I know that this is supposed to be a different kind of horror movie with an impervious killer, but there is just no excitement. It looks slick when the nurse's boyfriend is killed behind the marbled glass in the hydro-therapy and it is neat when the nurse believes that Michael is her boyfriend, but afterward things go flat with Michael drowning her. The idea that Michael can stroll around unnoticed and people can bump into him without recognizing him seems contradictory. We are never told why Michael decides to kill who he does and then ignores everybody else. Halloween 2 does something different in that there are no teenagers getting naked and then dying at Michael's hands. The idea that a hospital would be as deserted as the hospital in the movie seems far-fetched. Neither Carpenter & Hill nor Rosenthal make any of the victims look sympathetic. Michael seems far too clever to be doing what he gets away with. Halloween 2 is predictable because we know Michael cannot be killed in an ordinary way, but it is also predictable because we know that his victims will die horribly but pose little threat to him. Altogether, Halloween 2 has all the dramatic impact of a flat-line on a heart monitor. The dialogue is strictly expository with nothing in the way of memorable or quotable lines. Indeed, Michael here is such an inexorable source of evil that he is neither interesting nor intimidating. He emerges as a one-dimensional character that you don't care about any more than you sympathizes his cardboard victims. Halloween 2 qualifies as an exercise in nihilism.

Basically the film picks up where it left off, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) shooting Michael Myers six times, he falls out the window, and managed to survive and disappear, and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to hospital. If you remember the first film really well, you would know that the suburban area was sleepy, it must have been like 2 or 3 in the morning, and now all of the sudden there are many people out and about, and that's away from the hospital. Anyway, Michael is obviously trying to find Laurie, and in the process kills some more people, oh, and you find out Laurie is Michael's biological sister, which gives you I suppose a good demented reason to kill her, you know, because he killed his other sister as a kid.

I can agree that besides H20 20 Years Later, all sequels are rubbish, but what makes them even ridiculous is that Pleasance clearly died in this one, blowing himself and Michael up with gas and a lighter, Michael I can understand surviving, seeing how many hits he took in the first one, but Pleasance I can't understand surviving. As for the film itself, the remade music is completely rubbish (with the added keyboard), the deaths are okay, but you just can't really be shocked or surprised by them, a rubbish sequel, and many more follow.

I would like to complain that out of all the slasher movie franchises, I FRIGGIN' HATE Halloween above them all. While although the first one was by far the superior installment of this franchise, the sequels are just plain stupid. I'll give you a few good reasons why in the review as I had to look up the definition of a spoiler before I could go onto write anymore reviews on here.One of the biggest turn offs in a film is inconsistency of logic or a lack of realism at least. Therefore, most movies --regardless of genre-- are turn offs as a rule for that reason. I mean it would be one thing if Myers was a resurrected psycho like Jason who couldn't stop, but he's clearly not. He's human like you and I, though apparently on PCP or something that makes him almost superhuman. I guess I could forgive the latter sequels more easily because that's exactly what he's supposed to be in those.Kudos I think that this is the only slasher I've seen that's based in a hospital. No other slasher that I've seen since has had such a prop-base.Complaint Michael Myers gets shot right between the eyes, and then gets back up and starts stalking again. I don't know if anyone else caught this, but I did and I have found that to be the BIGGEST INSULT to my intelligence. Even a crack-head on PCP would think twice about stalking when shot between the eyes! In contrast to the first film, I found this to be equal to getting stabbed in the jugular w/ a knife. OUCH! Then, they blow themselves up, kill Myers, and leave in an ambulance. Wtf? * Laughs *Whoever wrote that script ought to have been fired for stupidity! And unlike in the last film, Michael Myers, as someone else mentioned, has been reduced to nothing more than a human shark swimming after his prey in the sea of terror-struck-Haddonfield. And this is well portrayed in even Michael Myers' mannerisms as he seems somewhat stiff in contrast to the original. (I guess he hadn't gotten used to having about six slugs plugged into his major organs, already.) There are one pair of tits at least, whom are ravaged in one of the meanest scenes that I've seen in a slasher. And there is a lot of blood, though it's not excessive as some other slashers I've seen. And how Myers escapes getting his hands burnt off during this is a mystery to me? As for me, the audience, being that this was cable TV, I was bored thru this, while wondering what kind of crank that Carpenter and crew were on when they wrote this? But anyways, I gave it a 3 because I could finish it and I even fell in love w/ some of the characters; so the acting wasn't bad at all.

MM should have been caught as he was watching Loomis talk to the cop, there were a load of children walking down the alley and in the amount of time he was watching Loomis they would have reached where he was standing. I've debunked the film in the opening 10 minutes.The 2nd pretty HUGE goof is the guy they've got playing The Shape AKA MM, he is no-where near as big as the guy in the previous movie, he's too short and way too slim built to be Myers. If he's going to be lifting anyone up and throwing them around like the original it won't be believable at all.The story of the murders and the killers escape makes the TV & Radio news FAR TOO QUICKLY! This type of story back then would have taken days to be released, for fear of causing a local panic. The fake scare with the cat was very predictable (outside the hospital). It is amazing that none of the mob outside the Myers house tried to burn the place down (you'd think at least 1 person would try!).Now we only find out Laurie & Micheal are related in Laurie's dream sequence so that could have been a whole red herring. It's also obvious that both the nurse and orderly are going to die as they've had sex.Would anyone like to explain how Laurie went from unconscious and catatonic to escaping down a corridor in mere minutes? And MM would NOT be able to lift that nurse up on a tiny scalpel the way he does, the blade or handle would snap!Loomis put 5 rounds into Myers in the foyer (so he's now been shot 11 times), I assume the empty 9mm he points at MM before he gets stabbed was a gun he took off the Marshal in the car. Laurie manages to fire 2 shots from a revolver that only had 1 round left in it hitting MM in both eyes (a shot that even a marksman would struggle to make at close range in the dark and she was firing with a bad shoulder!).Our final look at Myers sees him face down on fire (having somehow survived a gas explosion but he was already blind anyway) and almost certainly dead and Laurie Strode being taken to an unknown destination.Weak ending and awful sequel, especially the idea of Laurie being MM's sister.

It follows our surviving characters as they continue on through October 31, 1978, which has got to be the longest night in the recorded history of mankind. How many hours were in that day, anyway? Laurie is whisked away to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital in an ambulance, and it never occurs to anybody that Michael might want to finish the job he started on her, or that wherever she is, they'll find him. There's also a very silly 'plot twist' about Laurie's connection to Michael. The new characters are a bunch of hospital employees who are mostly uninteresting and are clearly only in the picture to be murdered.So why do I keep coming back to this sequel more often than the original?It's illogical, but this movie has a lot of the same appeal of Halloween. I love the fact that they just went for it and started the thing exactly where the previous film ended. Once you accept that this is not the original, there is more to love. What Halloween II has going for it is a very European sense of style that mimics Argento's best moments. Visually, the movie looks great. We've yet to see a truly great DVD transfer for Halloween II, and I hope one day we get it. There are a lot of subtle, eerie touches, some recreated from the original and a few new ideas. Characters drive around nighttime streets with their faces illuminated by green lights in the dark vehicle interiors. Laurie's hospital room is dim and intimidating, large shadows moving over her bed. It's never explained in the theatrical cut, but the hospital turns dark and spooky by the end of the movie, and there's something very unsettling about seeing a hospital so dim.The Carpenter game plan of having The Shape lurking in the background works well and often here, particularly an opening sequence where it is glimpsed behind a woman in her kitchen. In another, it is glimpsed as a shadow, and in one of the best shots, the ghostly white face looms behind several panes of glass through a darkened room. Dean Cundey revisits several shots from the original, like the mask slowly materializing out of the darkness behind an unsuspecting character. There are also a number of point-of-view tracking shots in this one; Carpenter did it first in the original, but this is also another favorite Argento trick, usually used to disguise the identity of the killer. The only difference is that here, we already know who's doing it.Another brazenly Argento touch is the music. The brilliant original score has been pumped up here, it's almost like a score by Argento's own favorites, Goblin. One or two of the scenes pay homage to Dario with no misrepresentation, including a murder where a woman is drowned in a tub full of scalding water (from Deep Red). Also, note the segment where Laurie escapes The Shape by shimmying through a small window near the ceiling, only to find that it leads not to safety, but to yet another room on the other side. Lucky for her, it wasn't a room full of razor wire.It's sad that the script didn't give Jamie Lee Curtis more to do. As if they only had her on-set for a day or two, she spends most of the film in a catatonic state, revitalizing only at the climax where she must flee from The Shape once again. Her actual dialogue in the film is very limited, and even worse, they made her wear an awfully cheap-looking wig. Donald Pleasance, on the other hand, carries a lot of the film, and is even more over the top, practically frothing at the mouth. While the film has its Argento cues down pat, it does lack his manic energy. Dario's best movies seem to lunge at the viewer, while Halloween II is more like a trash compactor, moving slowly and inexorably toward a bloody conclusion. The biggest disappointment here is the attempt that's been made to 'explain' things by giving Myers a motivation for his attack on Laurie. Even worse, Carpenter's script ignores something that made the original so nerve-wracking the murders were perpetrated by a homicidal maniac who also had a childlike sense of humor, as in donning a ghost-sheet to toy with one victim before strangling her. In this film he's more like an efficient windup toy. The gruesome murders are mostly implausible, but otherwise quite memorable in their outrageousness, and something must be said for the way that this film taps into the inherent revulsion of common hospital equipment designed to cut, poke, and prod into our bodies in the name of medicine. The most unsettling moments involve needles being inserted into parts of the body where they can do no good.Unlike the original, Halloween II was written off by most critics upon its release, and perhaps rightfully so. A movie called Halloween II could only be more of the same, especially since by 1981, the slasher genre was in full swing (ironically sparked by the success of the original Halloween). But what this sequel has to offer is nostalgia for fans of horror films in general; for about 90 minutes, you get to imagine that the original film never ended. As if that wasn't enough, there are a number of affectionate homages to the films of Argento, and they work almost as well here as they did in his own movies. Like the best gialli, Halloween II gleefully overlooks its own silliness and becomes a stylish nightmare. I find that, even though it's technically not as good as the original, it is also a noteworthy film in its own right, and equally memorable.

I don't know what they were thinking when they made this monstrosity, or maybe they weren't thinking at all is more likely.Whereas in the original Halloween, John Carpenter built suspense with things we couldn't see, and things that go bump in the night, here we get scenes thrown in just to see how shocked we will be.*********Possible Plot Giveaways Ahead If You Really Care*********** We pick up this movie exactly where the first one left off.Donald Pleasance returns in his role as Michael Myers own personal psychiatrist, but plays the role as if he could have used a couple of valium himself.  Jamie Lee is back of course, and is carted quickly away to the most unlikely hospital you'd ever want to be cured in.  Not only is there hardly anybody working at this hospital,there aren't any patients either, other than Laurie.  Imagine, your own private hospital.  We do see a kid going into the hospital with a big piece of glass stuck in his mouth,because he ate something out of his Trick or Treat bag before Momma checked it out. The scene is totally pointless, put in simply for some kind of shock value, and probably spooking a lot of parents into not letting their kids go Trick or Treat come Halloween Night.I have been in hospitals late at night, even small hospitals such as the strange one in this movie and none of them were ever as quiet as this one. There is so little to do in this place, that even the Nurse has time to go down to the whirlpool room to have a quickie with the Ambulance Driver who just happens to be her sleazy boyfriend.  Of course, we know as soon as they go in there they've had it and that the whole thing is a setup for Michael Myers to perform another of his horrifying deeds.  All the while we've yet to see any other patients, or see their room lights going on so I guess if you're in this place, you fend for yourself.By the time Lance Guest, slips on a pool of blood, knocking himself out, we're in hysterics....that's laughing hysterically from how ridiculous the whole thing is.  Jamie Lee Curtis is given little to do here except lie in her bed looking distraught, then crawl and limp around the hospital looking scared.  Fortunately, her career would recover, if not her leg.This movie was scribbled by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, misdirected by Rick Rosenthal so that John Carpenter wouldn't have to take the blame entirely I suppose.  If anything else, this film should have permanently sunk the franchise, but like the famous bunny, it just keeps going and going and going and going......Too bad for us.

Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasence) has shot Michael Myres 6 times & Laurie Strode (Scream Queen Jamie Lee Curtis) is going to hospital. But, Michael has left the spot where he landed after the shooting & is loose on the streets of Haddonfield-again. While Myres is on his way to the hospital to get to Jamie, Loomis & friends are failing to capture the shape.Nothing much or original going on in the plot. Just a continuation of the first. Still, the movie is really tense-especially how the film is set up. There are really suspenseful chase scenes unlike the original Halloween (1978) which was a really good horror film but just isn't scary or suspenseful. Just well-made. Halloween II however, manages to do what the first part couldn't. It is full of suspense. But unlike number 1, there is no time for character development so none of the characters are likable enough to root for. The once likable Laurie Strode is now a weak Jason Voorhees victim who just won't talk. Speaking of Jason aka villain in Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), Halloween II (1981) is better in many ways but there is no time to get into that. This flick is clichéd & predictable as hell.() a combo which ruins any horror movie. Also this pic gives Michael Myres backstory which ruined the mystery & horror of the character. It also ruined Laurie Strodes character & the development of the plot in the first movie. I mean the rampage in the original was obviously random.But what this film does have is descent acting, a good score & good direction by first time director Rick Rosenthal. The Halloween song is fractured kind of but i like the original better. Another thing is that this movie introduced the Mr.Sandman song into the series. That song goes with the film very well despite the fact that one doesn't relate to the other. But those things don't save me giving this movie 2 out of 5 stars.At least we get some effective death scenes & some good gore. Unlike the first, Halloween II has a gallons of gore. The gore in the original is underrated. The gore in this one is overrated. Memorable death scene involves a bath tub.Bad slasher sequel which is awful compared the classic original.

We now have continuous story flow which is indicative of the strength of the original concept. Audiences did not have to put up with some ill &#150; conceived spruced up story which gave an excuse to bring Michael Myers back to the big screen. From an unoriginal perspective, we do have the predictably higher body count. Fortunately it did not reach the levels attained by other sequels within the genre. The other predictable element of this horror sequel is that the death sequences are far more gruesome. Notwithstanding these obligatory elements, the sequel is relatively strong and although not as good as the original, this sequel did much to build on the ominous reputation of Michael Myers.Looking at a sequel is surprisingly interesting. We have the original to compare to and we can access how the characters have developed. In this one, character development was not an issue since we are dealing with a story that follows events directly after the original. This in itself is interesting as we do not see this very often.There are elements that contribute well, but also those that contribute poorly. The ones that contribute well is the soundtrack, the Shape and Donald Pleasance. Elements that did not work well here is unbelievable character decisions, and poor special effects.The music is for me the outstanding element here. The opening theme track seems to be updated with more bass giving a far more &#145;in your face effect'. This is exactly what Michael is. He is no longer an unknown force. Haddonfield knows he is there somewhere in the shadows &#150; lurking, waiting to strike. Therefore the theme does not emphasise the suspense indicative of the original &#150; rather the gruesome intent of the villain. This seems to be more in line with the Halloween festival around the world where the costumes are loud. The movie had become more indicative of it's title.It has been mentioned by other users here that the &#145;Sandman' track is out of place. Although this may seem so on the face of it, I feel that it offers a contrast to the Halloween theme track as a &#145;feel good' track is played and then we are led into the ominous theme track &#150; muck like what would be done at Halloween parties. This sequence of track, probably not intentionally, highlights the way that this story has become synonymous with the festival as previously touched upon. It not only takes the name of Halloween. It takes the character of Halloween. Myers is the evil that never dies &#150; the bogeyman. John Carpenter has created a story that identifies strongly with makes no small contribution. October 31st and has stolen into the ceremony. His music is a prime example of this. The Shape is now played by Dave Warlock. The suspense lacking from the script itself becomes evident in his body language. His movements accentuated his evil presence and dehumanised him. It also shows us that he is not a normal human being - rather a cold, soulless entity that exists only to kill his sister.  This was also evident in the first, but was more noticeable in this movie since we saw more of Myers. The Shape was given more screen time, but his basic character remained true to the original. A necessary keep &#150; over since the sequel deals with the same night the attack started.Donald Pleasance is as much affiliated with &#145;Halloween' as Jamie Lee Curtis is. His major contribution is creating a sense of plausibility for the audience. He recites his lines with such authenticity that the audience will be drawn into the story. We think of the &#145;mad scientists' of an era gone by, only this is not his creation but a shell born onto the world to carry out evil deeds. He is what Alec Guinness was to &#145;Star Wars' and what Vincent Price was to horror movies. Pleasance adds to the aura of Myers and was a vital part of the &#145;Halloween' franchise. Even with Jamie Lee Curtis on board in the most recent &#145;Halloween' movies, the impact of the first two &#145;Halloween' movies was never rekindled which is due in part to the loss of Pleasance. He was a great opponent for Myers.The believability added by the abovementioned members of the cast was undermined by unbelievable character decision making. Curtis is always hiding not far away from Myers. Not rational for somebody who was previously attacked and knows what she is up against. There would have been more plausible solutions to making Curtis more of a helpless victim. She could have injured herself while she was trying to escape and the perfect opportunity for this was in the hospital when she narrowly escaped Myers. What she did, did not assist the story, but weakened it. It is these areas within which audiences drawn in may be lost.The effects were weak in places. The blood drained on the floor was way too red. It served to weaken the movie since this is another element which may jolt audiences from their imagination. Special effects serve to add believability to the story and when attention is drawn to them in a negative sense, the story can only be adversely affected. It was also too much blood for a Myers kill. He strikes a lethal blow rather than causing too much gore. It is unfortunate that this seemingly obligatory element became a part of this movie.I had seen this movie before the original and for some time favoured this one, mostly due to the haunting soundtrack. But I grew to prefer the original because of its suspense. The music, in my opinion, is still better in this sequel since it adds ominous intent to Myers and more truly reflects his character. But this was not enough to improve it over the original and if the weaknesses mentioned above were ironed out, we would have had a much stronger comparison.  What separates &#145;Halloween' from other slasher movies is that Myers has real purpose, although there is no evident motive. He exists solely to kill his sister. Myers does not kill all that are within his territory, but those that may stand in the way of his objective. This is the essence of the story and gives reason for his continued existence. This has now been stopped in the most recent &#145;Halloween' movie &#150; &#145;Halloween Resurrection' and although it is said that this gives way to a new story, it seems to lead it to older stories where the villain kills senselessly. It is true that it had to change in some way, but if Myers is not stalking a relative his core purpose is lost. I am sure that there will be another sequel and I am hoping that they bring back Laurie. The original concept was very good and if the story is going to continue, the foundation should be kept.

As a result, horror films began to pirate one another left and right, while the franchises themselves seemed to be mostly bereft of ideas. There are some franchises, such as Friday The 13th, that recycle so much that one could be forgiven for forgetting which episode they are watching. Halloween II has more in common with Friday The 13th than it does the original Halloween.In spite of the massive continuity error early on in the film, it picks up more or less exactly where the original left off. Michael Myers has survived his encounter with slugs from Doctor Loomis' pistol, and is wandering around the suburbs of Haddonfield, killing people almost entirely at random. This, in essence, is the problem with the entire film. Whereas the first film took the time to properly set up a cast of victims and make the audience care about them, Halloween II's entire cast can be summed up as anonymous boring girl/guy.Another problem is that the entire film has Michael walking along at a sluggish, almost retarded pace. I've seen people who have more Thorazine than blood in their veins move faster than Michael does here. As a result, the critical audience is tempted to yell hey, anonymous boring girl, try jogging, he'll never catch up with you. It's one thing to have a slow-moving monster who eventually catches his victim through sheer persistence (or stupidity on the victim's part), but when rooms have multiple exits, or the monster casually strolls in one someone in the sauna, credulity just doesn't apply.This marks the first time that the anonymous long-lost relative plot device was used in the Halloween series. In the original, we had no idea why Michael was tracking down Laurie. The plot synopsis on the video box simply tells us that he wants to relive his crime. Halloween II simply tells us without any establishing shots that Laurie is Michael's other sister, who was adopted shortly before or after the original murder shown in the first film's prologue. Footage of Loomis examining official files, or even a walk-on cameo appearing for the sole reason of explaining this plot element, would have been nice.Another idiotic moment comes when we discover the name Samhain written in blood upon a wall. For hours after that point, we get minutes of dialogue about old pagan gods and the unconscious mind that is so stilted one cannot help but laugh at it. One has to wonder if Donald Pleasance was under contractual obligation to appear in this sequel, because it is hard to imagine a respectable actor appearing in a film like this out of a desire to work with the new cast and crew, or to revist the story.I gave Halloween II a one out of ten. I think I am being extremely fair given that the film is boring, overlong, and contains some of the worst padding yet to appear in a horror sequel.

Halloween II feels like a dumbed-down version of Carpenter's earlier effort Assault on Precinct 13 which in itself was mediocre. This time the action is set in Haddonfield's local hospital as Laurie Strode (Lee Curtis) recovers from actions that wounded her a mere few filmic hours ago. I will agree that Halloween II feels bigger and more expansive with the film making use of its setting's long, bleak corridors and different rooms inside the hospital but everything else it does is either a copy of the first film or just isn't that good.There are times in Halloween II that make you just chuckle in disbelief; there are other times when you look away and there are other times where you just find yourself screaming at the characters on screen. Dr. Loomis (Pleasence) does exactly what he did in the first film, ie; he runs around a lot, bickers with the local authorities and seems himself a little mental at times in trying to capture Myers &#150; he even shoots at a 17 year old kid dressed like Myers only to have him run in front of a car and get impaled on a van what was funny here is that at the mortuary, nobody sheds a tear for the dead kid; they just resume worrying where Myers is. That is Halloween II in a nut shell no heart, no soul.I mentioned the hospital making a good location, well it does. However; the rest of the staff must've been away trick or treating because the people that are there are not doing much apart from maybe attempting to lure one of the opposite sex members into a hospital bed; you can guess that they meet for grizzly ends because the instant you become sexually active in a horror film, a nasty fate awaits you. Halloween II by this point, though, has detached itself from the original completely in terms of camera work and use of space within the frame. In this edition, someone dies within the first five minutes and yet it took a whole forty odd minutes in the first one; instead of using brains like the first film, Halloween II would perhaps prefer to show us brains by the time it has dissolved into a messy montage showing us all the ways you can kill a person using a melee weapon a hammer, a scalpel and a particularly nasty one involving a syringe &#150; what a surprise, all the weapons he uses are items you can find in a hospital.The problem here is that Laurie remains the only character in the film that worth caring for. Loomis spends most of the time away from anything going on, like I said and even then; Laurie spends most of her time on her back in a hospital bed. Everyone else are not characters but mere puppets used in a freak show of violence, murder and nasty scolding so bad that I can't remember most of the character's names. There is a nasty irony behind the deaths the guy in charge of the hospital probably has a say in which patient gets what amount from syringed drugs and he dies via syringe; the night watchmen-come-handyman gets it with the hammer and the sexually active nurse who states that 'she's hot' or something like that gets burnt up pretty bad.So after we've been presented with these murders of people Myers didn't have to kill with fantasies he could've fulfilled anywhere else, we get the final third involving Laurie and Myers. Myers is a guy who lumbers around as if he's the Michelin man gone without sleep for several days and yet off screen, he can cover the vast corridors of the hospital and catch up with Laurie in an instant. Myers can run but can't hide, Laurie is the opposite she can hide but can't run and would rather hang around the car park than run away from the establishment come the end. Halloween II is a film that will not amaze you, it will not scare you and yet it will probably entertain you. Feeling more like a video nasty than a proper sequel to a proper film, more recent audiences may want to pop in a Saw instalment, a Hostel film or perhaps Carpenter's Assault on Prescient 13 as Halloween II is 1980s torture porn mixed in with that 'last stand' atmosphere and made to look like a video nasty.

The first ten minutes of the film, partially a reprise of the end of Halloween, looks and feels almost exactly like the original. It culminates in the Shape a.k.a. Michael Myers taking the life of one more young girl in the residential areas of Haddonfield.After that, the movie takes a steady dive downward. Whereas the original was about suspense and build-up, the sequel is all about body count. The sequel doubles the number of youngsters killed from the original. And most of the stalking and killing takes place in what looks to be the most pathetic excuse for a hospital in the world Myers lays down his butcher knife in exchange for a scalpel.By piling up the bodies, suspense is almost nonexistent. Making matters worse, the star of the show, Jamie Lee Curtis, walks around in a daze during most of the time. There are a couple of bright spots in Halloween II though Alan Howarth's score and Lance Guest's performance as a Laurie Strode-smitten paramedic are among them.Overall, though, Carpenter and Hill should have made a much better film, given the resources they had available to them.

Also, being trapped in a minimally populated small town hospital riveted me and truly scared me. Years later, I realize that it has too much going on outside the hospital to be as claustrophobic as I wish it would be. There's a pretty futile plot strand outside of the hospital that detracts from the movie. If Halloween II were confined to the hospital, quiet with suspense slowly rising, with the murders and Jamie Lee Curtis immobilized in her room and such, it would be a greatly surpassing sequel. And even then, taking into account that the hospital has several wings, an emergency room and a surgical ward, it should not have a mere four nurses, one doctor, and two ambulance drivers staffed for the entire hospital, even if it is the night shift on the very Halloween on which several homicides have taken place.

However, with the reign of slasher-horror dominating theaters (thanks to films like Friday the 13th- a film inspired by John Carpenter's original Halloween), co-writer John Carpenter supposedly got cold feet, thinking audiences wouldn't accept the film if it didn't feature plenty of gore and nudity. So, according to Hollywood legend, Carpenter added several sequences of harsh violence and nudity in order to make the film feel more like the other slasher flicks of the day.And I think that's the issue. While I've heard director Rosenthal's original cut was comparatively tame, I think that all-in-all, it would have been a somewhat stronger film than the one we got. The added gore and sex just sort-of harms the film, by making it feel more conformist and cliché compared to the original.The film again follows the two separate story lines of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Picking up right after the original, Laurie is hospitalized and Loomis teams up with Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) to continue his search for the murderous Michael Myers (Dick Warlock). However, their paths are destined to cross again, as eventually, Loomis realizes that Michael has a twisted connection to Laurie, and has finally tracked her down to the hospital, where he begins a new killing spree in his attempt to murder her.The cast (while limited) is generally as good as the original. Jamie Lee Curtis continues to make for a wonderful, enjoyable heroine that you can't help but root for. And Pleasence, though a bit more over- the-top this time around, still gives a phenomena of a performance as Dr. Loomis. It's surprising that, through most of the sequels, Pleasence stuck around (appearing in every Michael-centric entry of the franchise until his death), while most slasher-film actors tend to bail. And it's even more surprising how committed he stayed to the role. Pleasence was always the highlight of each film, and this is no different.Director Rosenthal does a fairly good job with the material he's given. (Though Carpenter did direct the aforementioned added scenes) Much like Carpenter, he's keen to give us tasteful, long shots that build mood and atmosphere. Though I do think a few of his visual choices come across as sloppy, and a few scenes don't quite make sense when really looked at. (A scene where Loomis chases someone he believes to be Michael, only to have it end in a fiery bloodbath, is very suspicious when watched again. It isn't quite communicated well- enough.)The script by Carpenter and collaborator Debra Hill has a lot going for it, yet also has some really big issues. While it has a good pacing and some interesting twists and turns, portions of it feel contrived and sloppy. And new characters seem a bit too one- dimensional. (Such as a character who is only defined by a really lousy, over-the-top obsession with sex... to the point he even sings about it at one point.) But I do think it's a very solid effort overall, and I admire Carpenter and Hill's attempts to expand on the mythology of the series.Overall, I think this is definitely a solidly-constructed and very entertaining sequel. It never quite measures up to the original, but it's interesting script, solid direction and great performances make it well worth checking out for fans of the original, and for fans of horror in general.I give Halloween II a solid 7 out of 10.

On one hand, much like the troubles that befell the sequel to Jaws, Halloween II was met with its fair share of flaws and frustrations. A great many deaths were later re-shot by Carpenter himself to pump up the gore. And even some character moments were lost on the cutting room floor. So, in a sense, Rick Rosenthal's Halloween II is more like a hybrid cut, with some added gore cut in to make the film more horrifying.But is Halloween II a good film? Well, that's the debatable part. It plays fine when stacked right against the original film, playing more like a continuation of the first feature.Halloween II is the sequel we got, and it does have a few solid moments of gore, and a few scares, it's a masterful followup fans would have hoped for.

Although it can never quite match the original... Welcome to my review on the second Halloween film of the series. I decided to only review this film because there's more to talk about it than the original. The screenplay was written by John Carpenter but unfortunately wasn't directed by him. The film made more money than Friday The 13th 2 at the box office. The film is often picked on for its violence and how it overpowers the scariness of the actual film. Donald Pleasence returns as Dr. Loomis and does his usual solid performance. Probably the best parts of the movie are when he talks about Michael Myers when he was still his patient. The film takes place directly after the events of the first film which was a very good idea. I think the musical score in this film is more gloomy and dark than the original's piano version. The new characters are quite useless and forgettable but characters like Michael Myers aka The Shape and Laurie Strode are expanded on. The film is by no means bad like most horror sequels these days and try's very hard to keep up to scratch like the original. The only big problem with the film is that it doesn't provide enough scares for hardcore horror movie fans. The beginning of the film is nicely done and is still fairly good by the end credits, I recommend only singling out these two films because the rest in the franchise are lazy and useless... Anyway, HAPPY HALLOWEEN!

Sadly, the script just doesn't deliver. The kills are high in number, but the movie bores nonetheless because the deaths are nothing to look forward too. The closest they get to a creative scene is when the obligatory naked woman gets scalded in a hot tub. When I start considering that creative, chances are I'm watching a pretty uninspired movie. It's a good thing that Jamie Lee Curtis returned, but the best they could do with her was put her in a robe and have her run and scream all the time. Talk about waste of talent. One thing I did like however was how the setting was changed to a hospital, which I think was a pretty smart move. Michael Myers wading through those long, white corridors, it just looks right. Perhaps he gets too much exposure this time around, but that didn't really bother me much. Another thing I liked was the climax, which really should have ended it once and for all. How dead does a villain need to be to not resurrect? Anyway, this isn't the worst sequel, but probably not the best either.

While I don't intend to describe the entire film's plot in my space here, it's only fair to post a quick outlineAfter the injuries Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) received in the first film, she has now been transferred to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) continues his search for his patient, the infamous brainchild of John Carpenter (absent in the directing chair of this pic), Michael Myers.  It seems that six shots just won't keep a money making horror icon down and, as the tagline reads, The Nightmare Isn't Over!. Michael heads over to the hospital to finally knock poor Laurie off once and for all.  But it's in THIS entry in the series that we find out his motive...  Laurie is Michael's other sister.  Wow.  What a motive...... (and don't even try to justify this by laying that part 6 druid jargon on me because that film never should have been made in the first place.)Now, if you're still with me, you probably think that I hate this film. Actually, I adore this film and hail it as the best sequel in the series (I think Halloween III was the second.  I'm serious.  Shut up.  SERIOUSLY! Read my review on the H3 page explaining why.)  While the film can not compare to the relentless suspense of the first, it has an atmosphere all it's own.  Unfortunately, this is sometimes hampered by needless gore and pointless subplots (i.e., Laurie being M&M's sis, the kid with the razor blade wedged in his gums, etc..).  I also had a hard time believing that a girl who has probably never fired a gun before in her life managed to hit poor Michael in the eyes (one shot per eye!)  But enough of this.  Onto the good stuff -)Many complain that the hospital was poorly lit and near deserted, and of course *pshaw* that would never happen in real life.  But much of the lighting in the hospital is remeniscent of Dario Argento's brillant Suspiria, a film that geared itself more towards style rather than a complex plot and oscar-bound performances.  The proverbial chase scene near the end kept my palms almost as sweaty as the first and the score is once again beautifully composed and performed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, featuring dark and brooding bass-like synth hums.  Excellent cinematography by John Carpenter favourite Dean Cundy combined with the creepy atmosphere of a dark hospital (all those sharp tools everywhere...the script pretty much writes itself!) makes for a pretty decent shock-fest.All in all, try not to pick on poor Halloween II that much.  It had to compete with the success of such splat flix at the time like Friday the 13th, Happy Birthday To Me, My Bloody Valentine, The Burning, etc.  A horror film is supposed to make you jump and tense up and for me, Halloween II did just that.  Don't expect any first rate performances either, otherwise....you just don't know what a slasher is all about -)  I give it a 6.5 "},{"Title":"The terror continues...","Date":"23 December 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  This movie's story began right after the end of the first installment.

From the opening sequence we pick up exactly where the first film left off, making the two movies play like one whole movie in two separate parts. We continue focusing on Laurie Strode from the first scene and stay with her as she is rushed to the local Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. Rick Rosenthal is directing John Carpenter's script this time, and although he doesn't pull off the techniques Carpenter used in the original, he brings in some new ones that work just as well. The nonexistant gore in the original is very present in this one, and the mode of death changes for each victim, unlike the first where Michael only uses his knife and a phone cord. Very tense scenes are set up throughout the movie that make your heart pound (one in particular takes place in the hospital hot tub). Michael seems to be much more angry and dangerous in this one. He's not in the shadows anymore and it seems his mask has changed, but oh well. Overall, Michael is alot creepier and scary in this one. Watch out for him when he scrunches up his mask in anger. Someone should say bravo to Carpenter for setting the movie in a hospital. The long hallway shots and the creepy music make the setting a classic in horror. Michael roams the halls, searching for Laurie (and this time we find out why). Putting all the doctors, nurses, and Laurie in a place with someone like Michael walking around makes you terrified to see what's around the corner. Loomis is back, too, still out to stop him before he kills anymore. Some strange references to Samhain and ancient evil are brought up that rack up the creep-o-meter sky high. Overall, Halloween 2 is not better than the original, but it is by no means worse. Yes, some scenes have no purpose and the plot is nothing exceptional, but for a sequel it's good enough and besides you'll be too involved to care. If you liked the original, watch this one with it together. Although Carpenter and Rosenthal's direction take two different turns, both films are highly entertaining. And scary...

There are many effective scares throughout the film, none more so than the heart-pounding chase of Laurie by Michael Myers through the hospital towards the end of the film.  Everything in that almost 6 minute scene is perfect - the direction, the acting, and the music!!  Where do I start with the music?  Alan Howarth took John Carpenter's original score and beefed it up with some then state of the art synthesiser sounds, making it sound more frightening than it did in 'Halloween'.  Dean Cundey's cinematography should also be commended, as should director Rick Rosenthal for sticking so closely to John Carpenter's directorial style in 'Halloween'.  There are a few problems I have with the film, however.  The first is the lack of continuity with the original.  Laurie's hair looked the same, but everything else seemed slightly different to me.  I may be wrong, but when we saw Myers' eyes in the original, weren't they brown, but in 'Halloween II', when we saw them (when he stabs the girl in the throat), they looked distinctly blue to me.   But the rest of the film is, if not stunning, then at least arresting visually.  The Hospital seemed fairly realistic to me, a lot of people seem to have a problem with it having so few staff, but having spent a night in a very large hospital which covers a whole region and not just a small town like Haddonfield Memorial did, I can testify that at night in hospitals, staff are indeed very few and far between. I also liked the deaths (rumour has it John Carpenter found the style of the film too old fashioned in comparison with Friday the 13th, and so shot gory inserts for the death scenes behind Rick Rosenthal's back).  The deaths involve a hammer to the head, a girl being drowned in a very very hot hydrotherapy pool, a nurse having her blood drained and an assistant getting an anaesthetic injected directly into her brain.Aside from a few slight problems with continuity, I found 'Halloween II' an interesting and worthy successor to the original 'Halloween' and definitely better than any of the other sequels or 'Halloween' imitators, with the possible exception of 'Halloween H20 Twenty Years Later'.***1/2 out of ***** "},{"Title":"One of the better horror sequels","Date":"29 October 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  It may not be as great as the original, but in general, Halloween II is actually one of the better horror sequels.

It's a very original idea for a sequel and made THE NIGHT HE CAME HOME that much longer and terrifying. What I found to be a good touch was the contrast between the full and well lit hospital at the beginning to the empty and dark hospital of the end. It certainly the perfect setting for a horror film. The script, unlike the original, was pretty tight this time along, giving us further insight into Michael's evil and explained what Laurie's part in his sick quest is. I also dug how the town reacted to what Michael did and the search for him by Loomis is intriguing.ACTING Like the first, everyone is decent or at least bearable. Donald Pleasence is back again as Loomis and his character progresses perfectly from the last film. Jamie Lee Curtis is featured in the film less, but we already know her character and she gives another great performance. She plays the paranoid, scared shitless victim to a T...too bad she couldn't do the same in H20. Lance Guest does well as the love interest, who thinks with his heart more than his head.

No shots of a pleasant, normal neighborhood. Everything here is really, really dark. In Halloween, the darkness was just there. In Halloween II, Rosenthal goes out of his way to make the movie look scary. This could've backfired horribly, but instead it worked. I also liked how everything in this film looked so grim. Some of the shots he achieved (you know which ones) are totally creepy. This movie gets more tense as it goes along.OTHER The gore and nudity is upped here, thankfully.

Rick Rosenthal did a better directing job than Carpenter did on the first film. And I'll stand by that. Halloween II created a different, but still creepy atmosphere. What really helped it was the hospital setting a perfect location for a slasher film, the clean enviroment reminded me of the original Alien, the fact that the entire movie was set at night it's hard to pull off scary daytime scenes, though the first Halloween DID to some degree, and the new reports, thus spreading panic through all of Haddonfield.

People complain of Jamie Lee Curtis's lack of screentime, but I don't. We already know Laurie from the first film and to have the movie totally center on her, like the first film, would be quite boring. Laurie was just used in the movie where she was needed most and it worked.The murder sequences in this movie were gorier and well done. The gore was used tastefully, not over the top.

Carpenter didn't direct this one but produced it and wrote the screenplay. First-time director Rick Rosenthal did a fairly good job trying to imitate Carpenter's point-of-view shot from the original. The body count is way higher than in any of the first installments of the Halloween series but there is less suspense. The idea of continuing exactly where the first one stopped (actually it starts even earlier showing again what happened at the end of the first one) was a great move by the film-makers.Laurie is being brought to the local hospital with Michael Myers following her to finish his work. The hospital staff soon gets reduced before Michael tries to kill Laurie as well. At the end Michael Myers and Donald Pleasance seem to die in a gas explosion and we see Michael's body burning to ashes.But both Michael and Dr. Loomis reappear in Halloween 4 (after that great film called Halloween III Season of the Witch) what shows that Michael The Shape Myers isn't the only tough guy around (although he lasted one sequel longer than Loomis).There are certainly better ways of getting rid of your money but if you're interested in slasher films you might like it.My rating 6/10 (after this one, skip #3, go straight to #4) "},{"Title":"This is only the beginning!!!","Date":"17 March 2000","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  This is one of the best sequels to a movie that I have ever seen.  Please read my review on Halloween to understand what this review means.Anyway, Halloween II starts off exactly with the end of Halloween. Even though this movie was filmed three years later than the first, great editing and acting (especially by Jamie Lee Curtis) made it look like it all took place on Halloween Night in 1978.  What you see at the beginning is the actual end of Halloween, then when Dr. Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence) comes out of the house (don't want to ruin it for anyone) is when they started filming for Halloween II.Michael Myers, a psychopathic killer, has followed his target, Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis)to the hospital immediately after he tried to attack her.  This movie brings on a new cast considering it takes place in a hospital.  There is Nurse Karen (played by Pamela Susan Shoop) who, I think, has the most gruesome death of all,  Jimmy,(played by Lance Guest) who is a paramedic and likes Laurie, Budd who is a real jerk, along with people from the first Halloween.  Annie, Laurie's friend (played by Nancy Loomis) reprises her role, but only for a few seconds, Sherrif Brackett (played by Charles Cyphers) still helps Dr. Loomis track down Michael, Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens)is back and is the nurse that tried to transport Michael to a different ward in the first one and tells a horrifying secret to Dr. Loomis about Laurie and her connection to Michael, which explains why he's after her.This film has more gore than the first, or shall I say just has gore (the first one didn't) but it is ok, not too groes, and the score is very good, which is once again performed and written by John Carpenter.  He has re-recorded all the songs from the first movie and has put even more synthesized tones in them.  This includes Halloween-Main Theme, Laurie's Theme, and the rest.  John Carpenter has made up new ones for this film like He Knows Where She Is and In the Operating Room.You haven't seen the entire Halloween experience until you have seen Halloween II.

And? a Sexist movie can't be good? Aren't Gone With The Wind, Casablanca and the Quiet Man sexist by today's standards? A few people complained that the hospital it was set in was too dark? Well it's called artistic license move along. Some people stated the victims weren't like-able enough..This is particularly absurd, because held to this standard the original Halloween failed because neither Nancy Loomis or P.J soles who died in that one where exactly Doris Day.About the only critique I agree with is the whole Jamie Lee Curtis being Michael Meyer's sister angle, however the flashback sequences referring to it are creepy and added to the film, the movie could have just alluded to it using this scene, and left the whole scene out with it being explained to loomis (and the audience) and worked out another way for loomis to wind up at the hospital.Aside from that I can't find anything lacking about this film.

The movie picks up the moment the first film ends, which i thought was good but some people think it should have been set a few years after as Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance look clearly older. Laurie Strode is moved to the hospital where we are introduced to the skeleton staff working there overnight. Michael finds out Laurie is there and proceeds to enter the hospital, stalk and eventually kill everyone inside. The setting with the dark,silent eerie corridors is great, I also liked the hospital staff as the script gives you time to get to know them before they are dispatched in a number of grizzly ways. The actor playing 'the shape' is also very good at taking Nick Castles mannerisms and there is also a coldness in his eyes through the mask that is quite unsettling. The only thing I don't like is the whole sister link. John Carpenter confessed to doing this after having a six pack and trying to think of something new to add to the story. I don't like this thread throughout the movies. What was great about the first film was he picked on Laurie simply because she came to the Myers house - there was no reason or logic - he was just a weirdo.

There's no getting around what the film is at heart, an teen exploitation film now older than its intended audience was back in 1981, and showing it. Back in 1981, the deal was you walked in, told the ticket girl you were older than you looked, plunked down your $3.50, and got to see some nudity and gore served up with a smattering of suspense and lots of red dye #2. Telling people you saw the film later on, the one with the needle in the eye that was so much gorier than the original Halloween, bestowed upon you the same bragging rights you might get riding the steepest rollercoaster at Great Adventure or Playland. Now however, the film feels tired, lame, a trifle slow afoot, much like its villain.Still, I've watched this movie a dozen times, and like it. Maybe it comes from the same ugly part of me that enjoys Pac-Man Fever and Charo episodes of The Love Boat. But it seems to me Halloween II is genuinely entertaining, that it continues to be popular with so many people, never mind its predecessor, because it inspires some moments of real dread and plays to some elemental fears, what Dr. Loomis calls the darkness inside all of us. I still remember how I soaked up every inch of the big screen searching the tree-lined shadows and darkened hospital corridors for the man in the mask. Donald Pleasance has fun with his role, and makes a vivid, offhandedly dynamic impression amid an otherwise droopy cast. There's a couple of effective scenes near the beginning involving Michael, especially one where a teenager, listening to a radio bulletin about the first batch of murders, suddenly hears a sound in the next room and wheels around in a state of compelling fright. The look on her face, as they say in the commercial, is priceless, and still gets to me. Of course, walking into the room right after is probably not a good idea, but they all do that in these types of movies, don't they?Here's a theory Halloween was the better movie, but Halloween II made the franchise. A lot of the things we associate with Halloween came not from the first movie but here, such as the effective theme music (heard less substantially and much less suspensefully in the original), the notion of Michael as something other than human, the molasses-methodical nature of Michael's killing spree, the connection with Laurie, Dr. Loomis's signature trenchcoat, his insistence he shot Michael six times...Something about that Dr. Loomis guy bugs me. They say Halloween II is different because Michael kills more people, 12, as opposed to just five in the first one. But when you really look at it, Dr. Loomis is the real culprit. You have that poor Ben Tramer, nothing to do with Michael, whose bad luck it was to be walking down the street when Dr. Loomis's blood was up, and who was killed only because he got drunk, walked too slow, and chose to wear the wrong mask (which was nothing like Michael's, by the by, not that Dr. Kevorkian could be bothered to notice). Later Dr. Loomis forces a federal marshal to turn around (at gunpoint, no less), thus sealing another innocent's fate. Of course, there's Michael himself, roasted like a briquette in one of the worst breaches of the doctor-patient relationship in the annals of psychology. In fact, this may be a controversial comment, but if Dr. Loomis had simply waited for Laurie to get hers in the opening scene, the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital team might still be with us today. Alright, so Budd would have still been with us, too. But did we have to lose Nurse Karen? And Jill? Now, there was a hottie who did not deserve to die.I can't give this movie so much as a passing grade, but I probably will watch it again before I watch Citizen Kane or Chariots Of Fire, which won the Oscar for Best Picture the year Halloween II came out.

This is just as good as the first one with a huge improvement.The gore.The gore is in and staying for good.Michael went all out with this one,showing how mad he has been and effecting he's rage on others.And the final battle is amazing.Also both of endings,the one shown in theaters,and the other shown on television are both great in each view of each other.And oh yes,John's music is still affective.

My point by typing that is that this movie exceeds sequel expectations and thensome. The original Halloween scared millions into submission back in 1978, three years later in 1981 director Rick Rosenthal teamed up with John Carpenter and Debra Hill (Director/Writer of the original) to write a script for the next movie 'Halloween 2'. What impressed me was Rosenthals attention to detail, meaning he re-captured the entire ending of the first movie and played it back again into his new movie and somehow tied the end of the first movie and the beginning of his movie together and went from there, absolute genius is what I call that. What follows is an hour and a half of suspense, chills, trauma, gore, you name it, it's in here. Donald Pleasance joins the team to reprise his role of Dr. Sam Loomis, Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode, Charles Cyphers (a Carpenter movie regular) reprises his role as Sheriff Lee Brackett, Nancy Loomis makes a short cameo as Lee Brackett's daughter Annie (whom Michael got in the first film). This installment is just plain awesome to me, the old characters are back, the theme music is updated but is still just as creepy with now a synthesizer effect added to it. The ending could be considered questionable but I guess that depends if you've seen the TV version or the regular movie version. I'll let you make your own assessment as to how you feel the ending (or entire movie) was handled in general. A cinematic masterpiece, bossa nova. one million out of ten stars.

So this movie once again stays very contained maybe more then the first since it takes place in a hospital which was an interesting setting. Rick Rosenthal directed this one and would later make the worst Halloween movie in the entire of course Carpenter did re shoots to add more gore to a franchise which isn't gory its more intense and scary so it felt really out of place it was done because of how popular the kills were in Friday 13th.Now like i said before this movie takes place right after the end of the first film with Laurie recovering form her injuries at the hands of Micheal Myers. Micheal then makes his way to the hospital to find and kill Laurie Strode. Dr Loomis is working with Sheriff Bracket to hunt Micheal after he escaped from the six bullets Loomis used on him at the end of the first. The movie ends with Micheal burning to death after Loomis saves Laurie from being killed.So some interesting things to note is that Halloween has there Empire moment it turns out that Laurie is the sister of Micheal Myers and that's why he is hunting her down. So the movie is definitively one to watch not great but it's a likable sequel and ends the story with Laurie and Micheal. A random thing I loved about this film was the use of Mr Sandman since it is one of my favourite songs and it goes perfectly with the film. "},{"Title":"A More Frigthening (And Silly) Follow-Up","Date":"17 April 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" While the original Halloween always seemed kinda over-rated and cookie cutter to me (see my review of that for more details if you want), the sequel I feel manages to be a more cohesive viewing experience that sorts out a lot of the problems I had with the first film. Well, that and it's also bloody hilarious at timesThe story of part two starts right where the first one stopped. Serial killer and metaphorical bogeyman Michael Myers have been shot by Dr. Loomis, however when he goes to look at his body he finds him to be mysteriously gone, and he and the police have to go look for him to prevent more deaths. Meanwhile, the surviving girl of the first film Laurie is taken to the hospital, though it's soon apparent Michael is also on his way there.What I noticed quickly with this one is that the pace seems much better. There are a lot of spots where not much happens still, however they feel creepier this time around as Michael is shown much less sneaking around in the shadows while we are still aware he is there somewhere, making the suspense building work better as it plays on the fear of not knowing where he is to a greater degree. Another thing is that there is stuff happening at a more regular pace in this one, which yes includes more killing and horrors this time around, but also more character interactions and more varied locations and sets, which makes it feel more forward moving than the first one.However there are still some things I feel could have been improved further in this department, as it feels some scenes would have a bigger impact if they were put in a different order. The side plot with Dr. Loomis seems to be put on pause for a big chunk of the second act which makes his chase to hunt down Michael feel less frantic than it could have, and there also could have been more focus on Laurie and her having to deal with the trauma after the events of the first movie. There is also a new character who is introduced in the Dr. Loomis side story who is also working with the psychiatric ward, however since she is introduced so late in the story she is not given a lot of character building or much to do at all, which I was disappointed by.The story itself in this one is an improvement though in my opinion. While I found the first one to be too obtuse and vague to get anything from it, more is done here to give motivation to Michael and give some hint as to why he is basically invincible, which I feel is much needed to suspend my disbelief, while still keeping a shroud of mystery around him to make him more disturbing. When scary things start happening here I also found them to be much more memorable and effective, especially one scene where Michael is walking towards someone while they desperately try and get an elevator door open, which I also appreciated.The movie also uses the concept of Halloween to much greater effect this time around. Halloween costumes play an important part of the plot development early on, while the more prominent spooky decorations on display everywhere contrasts with the real danger of Michael Myers nicely, and it all basically feels much more Halloween-esque and like it's uniquely tied to this specific holiday.There is also one other thing that made me like this one a lot cheese. I have a soft spot for horror movies that are unintentionally funny at the same time as being legitimately scary, and I feel this movie tread that line in the same way as the first Nightmare on Elm's Street movie does. Both in the intro and outro of the movie they play an completely unfitting accapella song about the sandman, some of the kills basically turn into gallows comedy slapstick, and funniest of all an out of nowhere 80's action movie car explosion that is so over the top I half expected Arnold Schwarzenegger to pop up, all in between tense and gut-wrenching horror.Is it a perfect movie? Not at all. As mentioned the pace is still not the best, the acting isn't all that improved from the first one, depending on your opinions of what a good horror movie is the cheesy parts might be too much, and the music is also remixed in a way where it sounds more like Techno and is less spooky than it was before. However, I think it's a solid film none the less that is both entertaining and frightening to watch, has a story with more meaning and purpose, and also just feels connected to the holiday it's based on in a more substantial way. I'd recommend it for a scary movie night for sure.

In addition, if you're not able to take an underrated, the only good Halloween slasher sequel horror flick that I like and it is worth of a watch, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Halloween II (1981) is the only decent sequel horror flick from the 80's that I like. I love action, horror movies from the 80's I love the most, watching this movie last night for the first time in my life it surprised the hell out of me how good it is. I was excepting that I will throw up or that I will be scared to death, I wasn't I was really surprised and entertained. In my honest opinion If I am honest this is far better than the original film or any of the sequels and two awful remakes. I hate Halloween movies, specially I hate John Carpenter's original film and I hate Halloween 4 I hate them. I hate every single movie with Michael Myers in it, except this one and 3. I have nightmares for years. I have this wiled dreams about Michael Myers hunting me in my dreams. I have watched all movies in my teen years, except this one and Rob Zombie's remakes. I will not watch Rob Zombie's remakes!! Plot While Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hunt for Michael Myers, a traumatized Laurie is rushed to hospital, and the serial killer is not far behind her.This movie is very underrated and some people doesn't like it, I do. I wasn't scared by this movie, but two scenes did scared me in here. When the police car crashes in to fake Michael Myers and explodes that scene freaked me out and the scene where Michael goes trough glass door in the Hospital in front of the main entrance, that scared me. This scene was copied for Maniac Cop 2 (1990), I saw this scene in that film. I had no idea that Maniac Cop 2 copied this scene from this film. Donald Pleasence as Dr. Sam Loomis did an outstanding acting performance I have ever seen, I seriously love his acting performance. Jamie Lee Curtis did incredible acting performance as Laurie Strode I liked her. The real hero for me is still Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) R.I.P. (1919 - 1995) you are missed. The last actress that I like is Pamela Susan Shoop as nurse Karen Bailey she is gorgeous, charming beautiful and sexy. I have never heard about this actress after last night which she is beautiful, I am wondering what happened to her. Rick Rosenthal did a wonderful job directing his first movie, he did a perfect shots. Debra Hill and John Carpenter both of them did a great job as writing a script for this film and also producing it together.Thing's I like in this movie Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) was well written and was decent, better than in the original or even better than in the sequels. In this film Michael Myers doesn't kill younger kids or old people like the character did in the sequels 4, 5,6 and 7. By accident a kid hit's him self in Michael, but goes pass trough, people down the street are walking and Michael doesn't kill them. Michael doesn't kill a dog in this movie, I am an animal lover and I love dogs and I was surprised that Michael went pass trough. In this film Michael is a Predator and the Terminator one character in two, he kills one by one his prays. I like the Karen kill scene in the boiler room, Michael kills Karen (Pamela Susan Shoop) in the hot tub, but doesn't let his victim drowning in the hot tub, he takes her out and puts her on the floor, which is decent. I like two explosions in the film and I like the acting performance from Donald Pleasence which I was rooting for him. The film is set right after the original film and you see archive footages from the first film and Jamie Lee Curtis acts her character like she never left off the set from the first movie which I love that and I love the scene when Donald Pleasence shoots Michael six times.The origin's of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode are explained, you can even see Laurie visiting Michael in the hospital when she was a kid in Laurie's dream that was excellent.The best super scene that I love is the ending, when Loomis and Laurie are in the operating room. Michael stabs Loomis in the stomach and Laurie shoots Michael twice, seriously injuring his eyes. Loomis fills the room with ether and oxygen gas and Laurie helps him, he uses the distraction to allow Laurie to escape. Loomis then ignites the gas, blowing up the surgery room in the process and evidently immolating them both in the fire, Laurie jumps away off the explosion - wow it was awesome! Michael, engulfed in flames, stumbles out of the room before finally collapsing dead. Again Michael is the terminator who can not be killed, but in this movie he is been terminated awesome I love it!!!

The movie takes place immediately after the first one ends. It keeps the same vibe as the first one but with more action and felt more epic. It also had a more retro 80's vibe, obviously because it was filmed in 1981. This movie is very stylish and is really the best sequel in the series. Actually I would say this is one of the best horror sequels in general. This is when its revealed that Michael is Laurie's older brother. And the whole family dimension is set into place for the Halloween series. Some say this was wrong and that Michael should of stayed more mysteries in his intention like the original. Others say this gave an interesting edge to the series, and allowed for the halloween movies to have more sense than lets say the Friday the 13th movies. I will leave that up to you to decide. This is definitely a cult classic, and holds up on its own two feet. Something unique for a sequel, esp one that takes place directly after the first.

I'm fine with this, seeing as how Michael made his spooky, paces entrance, ramped up for a few warmup kills, and by this time he's ready for an all out bloodbath. 'More is better ' seems to be the mantra with horror sequels, and although this is not always a smart idea, I think it's nice to see him up his game from the first outing. This one takes place on the same halloween night, right after the first one left off. Seemingly invincible Mikey has taken on his heels, slipping through the suburban neighbourhoods and causing all kinds of misery, before eventually hunting Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to the hospital she has been taken too, with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) in full pursuit. This one purposefully tries to retain both the music and atmosphere of the first, and while it falters a bit and feels forced at times (I'm not a fan of the whole silly hot tub sequence) there's some really fine moments later on when Michael chases her through abandoned hospital hallways that are as God as anything in the first round. Carpenter steps back a bit, favouring producing duties as opposed to directing, and this shows at the seams a bit, but not enough to hurt the film. A solid sequel, perfect as a nice double bill with H1, probably the second best out of the original franchise.

But not before he has hacked his way through the staff of the (frankly, understaffed) hospital.And as always, Dr. Loomis is never too far behind trying to figure out Michael's next move.As far as horror sequels go this one is okay. As mentioned above it is a continuation of the same night in the previous movie, and it does a decent job of picking up where it left off in spite of some glaring continuity errors that make it obvious it's the early 80's and not 1978 like it's supposed to be.Halloween II does exactly what horror sequels are supposed to do; up the ante and raise the stakes. It relies more on blood and gore than the first one ever did (Friday the 13th was released in between the first movie and this one and as much as I loathe the Friday the 13th movies, the influence is there), and reveals more about the connection between the characters. In the first movie we are led to believe that Michael's fixation on Laurie is entirely random, but Halloween II reveals that she is actually Michael's long lost sister. Some say that this reveal makes the events of the first movie scarier, others say that it ruins it completely. It's up to you which category you fall into.Donald Pleasance once again brings the sense of foreboding and dread as Dr. Loomis. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't have much to do as she is confined to a bed for much of the movie and when Michael catches up to Laurie, the chase scene is just a re-tread of the chase from the first movie but in a hospital setting, though she does a good job at being the likable damsel in distress in what screen time she is given.

Most of them are cheap knock-offs designed to extract a bit more cash from gore hound teenagers, providing unsubtle laughs like the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise.Halloween II is different, however, and I'm glad I finally caught up with it. There are quite a few plot inconsistencies and the characters behave downright stupidly at times. But the schema of having Michael Myers hang out around the local hospital searching for his sister, polishing off whomever he crosses provides a pretty good movie overall.The film is a bit too gory for my tastes and some of the murders are undeniably nasty - the original Halloween was far subtler and much less bloody, but nonetheless this is an engaging and effective film, with a good performance from Donald Pleasence to give it some heart.Michael Myers' screen adventures should have ended here, however, for it could only go downhill (and did). His inability to die, in spite of having at least 11 bullets in him by the end of the movie, was explained in a later sequel, one that was later retconned. Hmmm. Never liked this angle, and it went unexplained in the first two movies.Season of Witch, which followed it, was a damn good film, original script by Nigel Kneale, no less, before it was changed and he removed his name from the credits. Still, as sequels go this one works and does not disgrace the original. "},{"Title":"Halloween 2 was not as good as the original. Still, it's worth taking a stab at!","Date":"30 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" While stylistically, Halloween II reproduces certain key elements that made the original Halloween a success, such as first-person camera perspectives & unexceptional settings, it's still, not as good as the first movie. It was missing, a lot of great suspense and chills that made the first, watchable. It further departs from its predecessor by incorporating more graphic violence and gore, making it way too similar to other slasher films at its time. In my opinion, it went, a little too far, and became, more of a parody of its former self. The reprise horror music featured here, was awfully different from the 1st, with a more synth-heavy arrangement. Even songs like Mr. Sandman, seem out of place. Not the best composed from Alan Howarth. However, it still makes a lot of sense, that a sequel to the first movie would indeed be, made. After all, the first movie was kinda successful, plus it end in a cliff-hanger. Directed by Rick Rosenthal, the film immediately picks up where the last film had left off. After having shot, the escaped killer Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) six times, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) believes he has saved high school student, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Only to find out, that the seemingly immortal mask-man, has escape, and follow Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to a nearby hospital. Can, Dr. Loomis stop Michael Myers, once and for all or will Laurie Strode, be the latest victim of the mask-killer? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I like that the movie is set on the same night of October 31, 1978. However, it's doesn't make, much lick of sense. First off, the town of Haddonfield, acts as if there isn't a series of murders, going on. Second off, the police are not, telling people to stay at their home, or to be careful. What the hell!? I really didn't like this idiot plot. Third off, the hospital in Haddonfield seem a little too empty for a murderous Halloween night. You would think, the employees wouldn't even have, time to have sex, when dead bodies are coming in and out, throughout the night. Also, when we see a kid admitted to the hospital with the razor blade. You would think, he would, play a bigger part of the film, since the movie spent so much time on him, but no, he doesn't. He rarely mention in the third act. Is he, supposed to represented, how sadism, Halloween has come? Probably not, but if written better. He could! Honestly, this movie has a lot of a filler that rarely moves the movie along, such as the Ben Tramer subplot. Honestly, why is Ben wearing the mask? It wasn't that popular! Another is how the film, focus so much, time on the hospital employees. I really don't get, why the film does this, if they're not really, part of the main plot? You would think, this sequel written by John Carpenter, would be a lot better, but no, there is still a bit of misogyny and misandry sexual psychology terms in these types of films. The female/male nurses are played as unlikeable whores & sex hounds. Another thing, while it's highly known and accepted, now. The revelation that Laurie was Michael's sister felt a bit misguided. Some felt that the reveal took away the menacing mystery that made Michael such an effective villain, as it gave a reason for him to stalk Laurie, instead of leaving it as an unknown motive. Others felt that Michael's obsession with killing his family members gives him, a good reason to continue to kill. This is rather divided twist to this day, but for the most part, people just seem to accept it as canon as it's used again in the remake in 2007 & 2009. In my opinion, despite Laurie being Michael's sister. His randomness of killing victims is still, pretty odd. I get, why he would kill the hospital staff, but, why does, he continue to killed random people, that has nothing to do with Laurie? Honestly, I really don't get his logic, why didn't killed the old lady in the beginning, or the man with boom-box? The only thing, I can take, is that he hate people that looks attraction. It's nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis reprise her role as Laurie Strode, however, it's not as memorable as the first movie. Most of the film, has her, bed-ridden trying to recover, from her earlier attacks. It was very short. It was also nice to see Donald Pleasence in this movie, though, most of the time, he seem less, and less, a doctor, and more and more like an armed vigilante. Dick Warlock as Michael Myers was alright for the most part; but he was a bit too short for the role of the Shape. One thing, that I really can't accept, about Michael Myers in this film, is how he can seem nearly impossible to kill. It made the film, less realistic, and more supernatural. So, it doesn't make sense that Michael Myers still able to survive, being shot, multiply times. It's really getting silly, when he able to drown people in boiling hot water, and not get blister. I know the sequels to this, are much worst, when it comes to him, getting injury but come on! This movie should had stop it, from continuing. Originally, Halloween II was intended to be the last chapter of the Halloween series to revolve around Michael Myers, but after the lackluster reaction to 1982's anthology film, Halloween III Season of the Witch, which feature a different story. The Michael Myers character was brought back in 1988's Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers in hope of recovering the film franchise. In my opinion, it never did. Overall While, the movie might be a little dated. It's still pretty scary. It was an alright sequel. "},{"Title":"Could have been a lot worse","Date":"16 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Halloween was a terrifying, chilling, nightmarish slasher flick which showed what horror should be and remains the only horror film to have me holding my breath for ages. Michael Myers is back and the night of hell isn't over yet. Sam Loomis tries to save Laurie Strode, who's stuck in a hospital. Despite having been shot 6 times, Michael Myers has survived and is heading for the hospital. Cue loads of ludicrous slasher mayhem and sequences of Jamie Lee Curtis screaming. At least she screams with emotion, attitude and believability unlike most horror movie characters. Halloween II gets a lot of flak from critics, but it's really not that bad at all. It's far from a great movie though. While the first was suspenseful and chilling, this succumbs to the clichés that the original's inferior imitators would follow and it retreads the original in a by the numbers fashion with plenty of rather dull gore. It's pretty silly as well. For example, the hospital in which Laurie Strode is in contains only her, a few babies and some irresponsible doctors.It's not as scary as the original, but it is still a little scary. Also, it is more fast paced than the first and there are plenty of entertaining and suspenseful chase sequences. It's not as well directed as its predecessor but the direction is good enough. Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis are excellent, and Michael Myers still makes a captain Kirk mask painted white scary. H2 remains watchable and enjoyable throughout and while it doesn't cover new ground it's still fun to watch and reasonably scary. The negative reviews really don't make a lot of sense. Michael Myers is a very effective villain. He's the personification of evil and although his repeated resurrections become tiresome he feels like a real threat and an unstoppable force of evil. Sam Loomis is a great character who is both enigmatic and compelling. Sadly, Donald Pleasance doesn't appear as much as he should cut he makes an impact. An underrated horror sequel overall, although some may have something to say about the film's disrespectful portrayal of hospital staff.6/10 "},{"Title":"Not As Good As The First, But So What?","Date":"11 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Everybody should have expected this movie to be inferior to the first. Sequels are almost never as good as the first. What makes this worse are the flaws and change of style. What makes this good is that is picks up seconds after the first one ended for a believable conclusion for Michael's killing spree. So it is only natural that there would be a change of pace with a bigger body count.Dr. Loomis shoots Michael Myers six times causing him to fall out of a window, then his body disappears. Laurie Strode is injured and traumatized after barely escaping Michael's clutches. With Loomis and the police seeking Michael's whereabouts, Michael himself has already made his way to the hospital where Laurie is at so he can finally kill her. As it turns out, Laurie is Michael's little sister, born two years before killing his older sister and adopted after the death of their parents. Finding out this information is nice to know and relevant, as it explains a little bit of why Michael wants Laurie, but never gives a full explanation. So there is still no motive provided, but he really wants to kill his little sister for some apparent reason. That is sadistic and scary. As Michael makes his way into the hospital to kill Laurie he kills random bystanders along the way, much like the first. For a hospital, it is pretty vacant. I'd say that is the biggest flaw. Other than that, a hospital location is a great place for killing, since a hospital is a place of certain death. Is a place of certain death like a hospital with a killer making mincemeat scarier than a quiet suburban town suddenly becoming a horror haven by one man? I don't know. I like both ideas. This movie just doesn't quite capture the essence and pazaz that the original had. But is is still a great flick nonetheless.

If you wanna kick it old school, most would say BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. In recent years, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS could hold a fight for that title. I would easily put this movie up for submission in that debate. In my head, there is a list of the 200 or so greatest horror movies of all time. While very few would be sequels, this would make that list.If you are going to start your assessment of this movie by comparing it to the original, then naturally it's not going to hold up as much. Carpenter's masterpiece is one of the greatest horror films of the modern era. Few thrillers or horror films have ever been able to match the sense of tension and suspense that was created by the original movie. Carpenter, essentially, created the mold that would be used for every slasher film to follow and it was not going to be an easy film to follow.There are many reasons that Carpenter is considered to be a master of horror and Rick Rosenthal was pretty much never heard of again. Most of the suspense that made the first so great is gone in this sequel. However, just as the original set the blueprint for what slasher films would follow, this helped set the blueprint for what a slasher sequel would follow. It has replaced the artistic touch by going over-the- top in its' approach. There is more death and more gore. The dramatic approach to making him an evil entity is taken to the extreme of making him a superhuman unstoppable force.The end result is a movie that still stands as one of the best slashers of the 80s. In later sequels, Michael may have become a mockery of himself, but he's in full terrifying presence here. As he stalks a wounded Laurie through a darkened hospital that is a claustrophobic feel that heightens the sense that there is no escape from this evil. The kills are creative without getting ludicrous. This is a genuinely scary movie. Special nod to the razor blade in the gums scene with the little kid which was the scene that scared me the most as a lil one, having grown up in the late 70s/ early 80s in the height of trick r treat hysteria, I became convinced this would happen to me one day.There are, also, some odd things in this movie which lower the rating a bit. Why doesn't Loomis recognize his associate from the loony bin? Why is Laurie the only patient in this entire hospital except for a few babies? How did a psycho like Michael, who was imprisoned at a young age, learn a word like Samhain and what does it have to do with wanting to kill his sister? Then again, as a tried and true horror film, I just sort of roll with things like this and forgive them as the little eccentricities of the genre.I would put this above any sequel from the Friday, Elm Street or Chainsaw series.

And they did not disappoint. Halloween 2 takes place directly after Halloween 1, on the same night. And so Laurie is taking to the Haddonfield Memorial Clinic. Michael then hears about it, and goes to the clinic, where he begins stalking and causing havoc as he always does. The film isn't as strong as the original but it is definitely a very worthy sequel to the original classic. Michael is more brutal in this one, he is more stiff and slower but his creepiness is still there. There is much more blood and gore in this than there was in the first one, however it wasn't over the top which made it fine. All in all, Halloween 2 is a fantastic sequel to a classic horror film. Granted, it's not as good as the original, but it is definitely a strong sequel. Job well done. "},{"Title":"I shot him 6 times!","Date":"23 October 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The following review will contain spoilers.Three years after the original Halloween film was made, the powers that be behind the original classic wanted another film. With John Carpenter off doing other projects, first time full length film director Rick Rick Rosenthal took over for the legend John Carpenter. While Rosenthal is rarely remembered for this film, I personally hold the opinion that this Halloween movie is not only the best film that was made after the original Halloween, but one of the best sequel ever made. The following is my review of Halloween 2.John Carpenter and Debra Hill both returned to write this sequel. They sought out the idea to have the film continue exactly where the original film left off. While this story is hardly remembered for being original like the first film is, I still believe Hill and Carpenter delivered a fantastic story. A twist in this sequel was that we found out that Michael Myers had another sister, and her name was Laurie Strode. Some fans even to this day question the logic behind this twist, but considering the powers that be behind the cameras wanted a sequel, I found this plot device to be worked out rather nicely. While Carpenter and Hill will always be remember for the fantastic work they dished out on the first film, I truly hope that in the following decades that people do not forget their fine efforts for this amazing sequel.The film was directed by Rick Rosenthal, and this film was his first effort at directing a feature length film. While Rosenthal is clearly no John Carpenter, I truly believe Rosenthal delivered a fantastic sequel, with some nice scares, even though the nudity and gore factor was turned up a notch on this film. This film was released during the time the slasher sub-genre was really taking off with films like Friday the 13th. Films like that had constant nudity and a great deal of gory deaths scenes. While this sequel did turn those factors up, I don't believe it ever hit the level of a Friday the 13th film. The scares aren't as great in turn because the extra blood flow is actually trying to scare you a little more than the thought of the kill, like in the original film. While this pushes the film down in my opinion, it really doesn't hurt it much because it never reached that high level of gore like other franchises hit in the 1980s.Back from the first film, Jamie Lee Curtis is truly a delight to have back for this sequel. She turned out one heck of a performance in the original film, and this film wouldn't have been the same without her. Some many times horror films suffer from bland acting. Not in a film like this with Jamie Lee Curtis. As I mentioned above, her character has a big twist to her in this sequel. She finds out she is the sister of Michael Myers. Shocking twist that Jamie Lee handles amazingly and really sells it. Back to play his famous role of Dr. Sam Loomis, legend Donald Pleasence once again is playing this very important role. The fact that Pleasence agreed to make this sequel is a shock considering how big of an actor he was, an even bigger shock though is the fact that Pleasence did three more of these movies after part two, for a total of five movies. To play a character like this for an actor like Pleasence is something amazing. So many fans love what he did with the character of Sam Loomis, and to do this he is one of my favorite actors.So overall, Rick Rosenthal gets a big thumbs up in my opinion for his amazing work on this film. While his efforts cannot possibly top that of what John Carpenter did on the first film, he lays out a fantastic effort for this sequel.Alan Howarth was tasked to mold the score of the first film into this sequel, while John Carpenter was off doing other projects. At this time the sequel was being made Howarth was doing work with John Carpenter on Escape from New York. In the 1980s, John Carpenter was known for using Synthesizers in his scores because it was so easy to use. Well, Howarth used this technique in this sequel to mold the score and update it. While the original score by Carpenter will always be my favorite, this score has to be my second of the franchise. It just adds so much deep depth to the film. I cannot get enough of it. Alan Howarth was given the task of molding the score from the first film and giving it an update for this sequel, and in my opinion he did a fabulous job.In closing, Halloween 2 might be overlooked by some of the fans who aren't deep into this franchise like myself, and that is a shame. While it doesn't really hold as well as the original, it does a fantastic job of being an amazing sequel in the horror genre. Which are very rare in this genre. Those of us fans of this franchise mostly consider this sequel to be at least good and one of the better films of the series. Those who maybe never had interest in this film because they don't like sequels, well, I can honestly say you are missing out on one heck of a great film.9/10 "},{"Title":"Halloween 2 is a descent journey into More of the Night He Came Home","Date":"20 October 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" After the tremendous and critical success of John Carpenter's surreal masterpiece, both John and Co-writer/Producer Debra Hill were asked to do another. Whilst they felt obliged and honoured to know that they're film had a profound impact on audiences and critics alike, John and Debra however felt that there was no need for another to happen, as the story really had finished at the end of the first. Producers desperately wanted to make another and fans were hoping so much to see more of the ominous and seemingly malevolent psychopath as they felt they couldn't get enough of him. In that case, John and Debra had rushed into coming up with what else they can write. And the final cut very much reflects the troubled shooting of Rosenthal's/Carpenter's sequel. First of all, I never knew there was a sequel to Halloween. Halloween is a very unique film that separates itself from many other Hollywood made films, and was not made by Hollywood standards, but with the fine art of world cinema. Halloween was one of my first modern horror film experiences when I picked up a copy at the old local video store. And what an experience it was. If I were to describe Halloween in one word, it would be Creepy! Throughout Halloween 2 goes along a path that although a little predictable, but it sticks faithfully to the stylistic of the versatile original . The minor quibble I have with is the climax, a few plot changes and at the end of the day, as Carpenter had stated himself, there's really no story.One area that left me particularly feeling unsure of were its lead talents Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance and it's not their fault. They do the opposite of what they brilliantly showcased in the first. Jamie is heavily sedated to the point she can barely move a limb or even have much to say, whilst Dr Loomis goes overboard with the frantic reaction when he discovered Michael survived the six shots blasted into him, as the direction by Rosenthal had called for. Unlike many Hollywood made movies, its a rare decision to take the direction as realistically as possible. For one, it makes sense for Jamie Lee to be traumatised and not as yet recovered from her injuries, but then again I felt she was just a little too underused. Because the ending was shockingly confusing, it left many waiting for a justification. Many saw it as being opened to a continuation. The hospital sounded like a great idea and it pays of for some decent shadowing in the endless and maze like corridors that supports the killing sequences. However for a local hospital in a popularized town, it seems to have very little medical staff occupying the place and it's as if it was staged to have only a certain amount of people there so they can be eventually killed. Speaking of the victims, they're nowhere as near memorable and developed like the original cast, but it came around a time, where in typical slasher fashion, to look out and focus more on the sadistic killer spill out the blood. The Shape this time around also takes a bit of a different direction. As we witnessed and listened to commentary of the first, Carpenter's direction with The Shape was to have him walk like a man with a hint of supernatural quality and Nick Castle (successful director of Dennis the Menace, Major Payne, The Last Starfighter) brought a foreboding and calculating menace of Gothic rock n roll quality about him. This time, played by Carpenter's frequent stuntman, Dick Warlock, there is a notable difference in the direction the two actors took on the Myers role. Warlock's was shown to be more violent and primitive. Above that, let's just say he seemed more of an android terminator than the malevolent being Castle gave of the original. What set me back was Warlock's take was to have him walk slow and I stress SLOW as in so slow, it's hard to image he would catch up with anyone he intends to kill and at times makes the film sluggishly paced.What I can give credit for this movie is the deaths which are more violent, but neatly executed. I believe it was actually Carpenter's choice to increase the violence as it was competing with many other slashers that were equally bloody violent. Apparently there is also a TV cut which sticks closer to director Rick Rosenthal's original vision of this movie. The majority of the extension I've seen while it did add a bit more on the staff, probably focused too much on the staff. Apart from the cut of Michael disabling the power fuse and a dialogue sequence between Janet and Nurse Karen, the theatrical cut remains the best presentation of the film. There was a lot of debate between Carpenter and Rosenthal as to how Halloween 2 should have been shown and the result is a mix of both's intense agreement and is the main reason why it is a mixed bag. At the end, this wasn't a movie that both Carpenter and Hill loved. The original Halloween was made with a lot of love and ambition and cut perfectly. Whilst it isn't as bad as the many unfortunate latter sequels and offering shockingly gruesome deaths with Carpenter's synthesized musical scores certainly used to effect, overall I found Halloween 2 to be a bit light in entertainment. I think the majority of of it works well in delivering a decent slasher-thriller set up but the fun stopped until the climax right to the finale. I prefer the hospital slasher Visiting Hours to this. I give Halloween 2 a mixed 5 1/2 to 6/10 "},{"Title":"Might alienate some fans of the original","Date":"14 October 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Making a sequel to an instant classic like the original Halloween movie was never going to be an easy feat, and there was probably no way they could make a sequel that would please both fans of the old and people new to the soon-to-be franchise. Halloween's ending was left completely open, and the formula used was obviously working, and the slasher/horror genre was definitely a crowd-pleaser, Friday the 13th, released the year before Halloween II, also drawing in large crowds, though with some more mixed reviews than Halloween.A higher body count and more gruesome deaths was expected, and the movie delivered on it. The most surprising (and pleasing, I might add) part for me was that the movie decided to pick up right where the original left off, instead of jumping ahead in time and coming up with some terrible excuse for Myers' return to haunt some completely new teenagers.No, instead this movie decided to take Myers, and build up his back story and character. While the plot in the original was limited to a madman who had been imprisoned for years going on a seemingly meaningless killing spree on teenagers, Halloween II gave out favorite murderer a reason for his killings. Not a very reasonable reason, but a reason nonetheless. It's revealed that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is Michael Myers' (Dick Warlock) biological sister. The seemingly random murders now seem more like Myers planning on finishing his job by killing his second sister.As was the case with Halloween, the sound track and the sound effects used in this one are absolutely amazing, and play a vital part in setting the mood for the viewers. The camera-work is still good, with long shots in dark settings, adding even more chill to the movie, as if it didn't already have enough.Pleasance is as great as ever in the role as Loomis, and though I'm seriously questioning Laurie's decision to hide instead of running from Myers, she repeats her performance from Halloween very well. The saddest thing for me is how 'The Thing' seems so much less intimidating compared to previously. On top of that, he's moved away from his precise, clean and simple killings, to more gruesome and bloody murders, which just seems to not fit the style. Sure enough, it becomes the new style for the future movies, but it certainly does take something away from the creepy aura that seemed to be emanating from Myers in the original flick.Halloween II has its flaws, there's no doubt about it, but it's still a great movie. As long as you don't go into it with your expectations too high (really shouldn't ever set your bar too high when it comes to sequels), you'll enjoy it. And I'll recommend it.

Carpenter even re-shot some of the movie himself.Like many sequels, it doesn't have quite the freshness of the original, and it's worth remembering that this film came after a few of the spiritual successors of Halloween (1978) had already been released, such as Friday the 13th (1980).There's less of the understated menace of the original; where the first film kept to the shadows, the sequel shows more explicit gore and violence. Whether this is simply a reflection of the larger budget facilitating better makeup effects, or a pandering to the new slasher demographic is unclear.The hospital setting is a fairly common horror movie location, whether a psychiatric hospital, ground zero for a zombie outbreak, or the lair of a mad scientist. It's even revisited in later Halloween movies. It's not a bad choice, but it's unoriginal compared to the previous film's deconstruction of idyllic suburbia. Hospitals can be creepy with little creative effort, naturally playing on our fears of injury and mortality, and providing Michael with more inventive weapons such as syringes and intravenous drips.Here, Haddonfield Memorial Hospital is almost deserted, evoking post- apocalyptic abandonment. The stalking of empty corridors also calls to mind admittedly superior horror movies such as The Shining (1980) which was released the previous year.Aside from Laurie, the only other patient we see is a young trick-or- treater in the Emergency Room. He has a razor blade lodged in his mouth, an early excuse for some wince-inducing gore which reminds us that it's still Halloween night and plays on the unsettling urban legend of dangerous objects hidden in Halloween confectionery.The ludicrously small night staff number just one doctor, one security guard, two paramedics, and three nurses. This cast become the new set of victims for Michael. Unlike many slasher films, they are not hedonistic teenagers, and based on their jobs, they should be intelligent and responsible members of the community.They do demonstrate typical horror movie naivety the security guard is bumbling, the doctor is a drunk (and his disappearance symbolises the removal of any competent authority from the setting). Some of their behaviour; a nurse and a paramedic slacking off and having sex in a therapeutic hot tub for example, is exactly the kind of reckless teenage abandonment which draws a serial killer in this kind of film. Sure enough, Michael is right around the corner to deliver some post-coital homicide.Even though Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence are back, their characters don't have a huge amount to do. This is a shame as their characters and performances are among the best in the series. While all the above has been happening, Laurie's been lying helplessly under sedation, and Dr. Loomis has been running around town with the sheriff following red herrings.Pleasence does get to give some passionate speeches on the supernatural origins of Halloween, which are suggested to be the source of Michael's near-immortality. The other revelation ties this in with Michael's bloodline; these themes would be explored in later, inferior sequels.Lack of our heroes is rectified in the final act when Loomis arrives at the hospital. Laurie's on the run, and everything thing goes down as you might expect, although the final fight has some unexpected elements. Dr. Loomis's act of self sacrifice seems fairly conclusive, but the eight other films in the franchise suggest otherwise.Trivia Dana Carvey appears in this film as an extra. He would later team up with a different Michael Myers in Wayne's World (1992) playing Garth.

I'm not normally a fan of horror film sequels, most are misses then hits in my book but this film is one of those hits.What I really like about this sequel is it's premise where it takes place just moments after the ending. I think thats a cool idea which is something I never see much, most sequels take place usually years latter. This approach made the first one connect more adequately with this sequel which made the two film seem like one movie.I love the score as usual, it's been remixed with the use of the synthesizer and I feel this film has the best use of it. I still like the original piano score, but the synthesizer version is great in it's own way it's still has a spooky tone to it but has an almost upbeat sensibility to it. Even like them using the old song Mr. Sandman which was never the same to me after watching this film.The main characters are good as usual. Jamie Lee Curtis is good as Laurie as usual despite not in the film that long. Laurie is really sympathetic because she's scared out of her wits afraid Michael is still after her, which he is. Her injuries really put a handicap factor on her which means she won't be able to move very fast. Yet, as usual she can still hold her own against danger, really loved how she handled the revolver makes me wonder if she is an expert marksman, if you've seen the places she shot. But I like that there was a revelation on her character which I felt provided depth to her and made her not just another typical wrong place wrong time protagonist.Donald Plesence is good as usual as Dr. Sam Lommis. His character was almost a show stealer, in a way this film made him more the main protagonist. I like how he's more active in this film, he has some memorable liners my favorite heightens my sense of security. Even sympathetic as the Sheriff who drank a can of dumb ass keeps blaming him for Michael's escape which really wasn't his fault, and his efforts get undermined for no good reason.Michael (The Shape) is still well him. I like that here we see some creative kills from him, the effects on those kills are really up to par but not to exploitive. My favorite kill is the hammer to the head, it was to me the most painful because of the little sound affect at the end after Michael swinged it overhead, ouch.However what powers the film the most is in it's suspense and atmosphere. I really like the fact that the hospital has been used as the arena. Hospitals in horror I always thought were creepy, heck whenever I play theSilent Hill video games I'm always a little wary of going in because they practically have death written all over them. Which is the perfect place for Michael, in the first one it was more open world where Mike had plenty of places to go, but here this is in a confined space despite limited to open area he has more places to hide then before, let alone all the resources he needs and Laurie where he wants her; these things really give Mike an advantage. Let alone location of the hospital which is far from town which means help is far away.I like the use of lighting, it's true that a normal hospital would never have that much low lighting at night. But this choice I felt was wise because it made the hospital seem instead of a place of danger instead of salvation. Each shadow and every dark corridor feels like The Shape could be hiding. Even like the use of the monitor camera shots, where we would see Michael walk in one hallway on the monitors which is basically a one step ahead device.And that chase scene my favorite scene in the film, between Laurie and Mike is thrilling and has the participatory factor as usual where I was thinking cmon find a way out now now now!; personally I like this chase scene between the two in this film the best because Laurie and Mike had more places to go and utilize the enviorment of the hospital well.The only problems is I do think the pacing of the film does lag a bit around the second half. I didn't really care much for any of the new supporting characters they were all two dimensional and disposable in my book, well OK a few of them have a moment or two like Budd who sings that song I thought was funny, but like I said moments it's not enough.Overall it's a solid follow up, it doesn't blow me away like the first but it's not trying to. But all the same like any Halloween treat it's worth a try. The night of Michael Myers is far from over.Rating 3 stars "},{"Title":"Horror in hospital","Date":"5 November 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Picking up immediately after the first film ended, and slightly changing that film's ending (Myers is shot six times and falls off the back balcony in the original, here he is shot seven times and falls off the front balcony) , JLC is taken to a local hospital, where she is treated for her injuries sustained in the original, and followed by the masked Shape. The local authorities are busy searching every back alley and quiet street in town, which leaves Michael Myers plenty of time to hack his way through the hospital staff, instead of heading straight for his main target, JLC.At times, this sequel has some of the same mood and atmosphere as the original, but the drawn out, torturous deaths are a bit too violent to watch, even for a horror fan like myself. A syringe in the eyeball, throats slashed, people boiled in scalding water etc. is all on tap here, in scenes directed by uncredited John Carpenter in post production.Television airings of this sequel rearrange the sequence of events, and show several scenes out of order, which only confuses the viewers more.Climactic explosion is good, as is the opening title sequence, but again, the film alternates between violently gory, and boring.

There are plenty of scenes I like that others like just as much.The first scene I like is when Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) walks into a minor surgery room to get Mrs. Alves (Gloria Gifford), the head nurse. Jimmy doesn't notice the red liquid on the floor under Mrs. Alves until he see the needle and hose sticking out of Mrs. Alves's arm. He quickly stands up to leave the room, but slips on what turns out to be blood, and is knocked unconscious.The second scene I like is when Michael finds Laurie. Laurie runs, as best she can on a fractured ankle, from Michael. She makes her way down a set of stairs into the basement, Michael follows. Laurie gets cornered, but sees a window that leads into another section of the basement and she climbs through just as Michael gets to her. Laurie gets to the elevator and the doors close just as Michael reaches them.The third scene I liked was when Dr. Loomis and Laurie are pursued into an operating room by Michael. Michael stabs Loomis with a scalpel, but doesn't kill him. Laurie takes the gun that Loomis gave her and shoots Michael, apparently, in both eyes. Loomis opens the compressed tanks, pure oxygen and ether, and uses a lighter to ignite the gas. Fortunately, Laurie has escaped, but witnesses Michael walk out of the surgical room engulfed in flames. He falls to the ground, again, apparently dead.Some other great scenes are when it is discovered that Michael had been to the elementary school and he stabbed the sister of a drawing of a family. Michael also wrote the word Samhain on the chalk board in blood. Dr. Loomis explains that Samhain is the Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the dark half of the year. Samhain is celebrated between sunset on October 31 to sunset on November 1. In Halloween II it is explained that Samhain is also the Druid God of Death.Or when Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes), Lynda van der Klok (P.J. Soles) and Bob Simms (John Michael Graham) are taken out of the Wallace house. Annie's father, Sheriff Lee Brackett (Charles Cyphers), pulls back the sheet covering her face. Before going home to tell his wife their daughter is dead, Sheriff Brackett berates Dr. Loomis for letting Michael escape in the first place.Also in Halloween II we find out that Laurie Strode and Michael Myers are brother and sister. Laurie was born two years before Michael killed his older sister, Judith Myers (portrayed by Sandy Johnson in Halloween). A few years after Michael killed Judith, Laurie's birth parents were killed in a car accident and she was adopted by the Strode family.I give Halloween II 10 stars out of 10. If they haven't been already, I declare that the first two movies of the Halloween Franchise are classics. They are pure psychological thrillers. John Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote perhaps the two best Horror/Thriller movies of the last 35 years. Carpenter and Hill take what Alfred Hitchcock did during his career and expanded on his psychological genius.

I do like how it continues the story of the first one and ends the 'real' story. I also like the hospital environment. I kinda like the idea of trick or treater's having the same costume as Michael Myers, but the movie kind of ruins it with one scene. This movie is not as settle as the first. This movie is where they decided that every sequel will up the anti on the violence. Which means that there is a bit more blood and gore. I don't mind that in this and Halloween III, but the sequels after wards kept up with that idea and i think that might of contributed to my disliking of most of the sequels. While this one isn't as good, it still holds up for me. Well that's my movie review for Halloween this year. Sorry it's late, i have been kind of busy with other life and all.

There are parts to this film that I really do enjoy, and yet it doesn't really stick out to me as anything other than a clone of other more inspired work. To go back to the time that this film was made, you have to realize that I think it was the first iconic horror sequel John Carpenter had no intention of doing this film, as he felt like he had done everything that he cared to do with the first volume, but he sure didn't mind the royalties, so the film was developed at Universal, where Carpenter would spend a large part of his career in the 80's. The idea of pre-steady cam pov shots that were popular in the first film were maintained with a new sense of gore that had emerged in the genre since the release of the first film. This lead to the original pick for director (IT's Tommy Lee Wallace) leaving the film. Rick Rosenthal, who had the same agent as Carpenter, was brought in. What you end up with is a original script and concept by Carpenter that is now being handed over to a large studio, you still have Akad, an Arab film producer who had released the original that still had rights to the franchise, Rosenthal who would try and put his own stamp on it. While the story line picks up exactly where the first film left off, and it does film in the gap of how we see the story from, but it really greatly deviates from the original and I can't help but wonder if the sequels hurt the legacy of the original. The lighting and camera work in this film remind me a lot of the first film, as their aren't any immediate stylistic deviations in the film, and you never lose the sense that it occurs in middle America, as Loomis is driving around trying to find Michael after he isn't there after being shot seven times by a six shooter. Lauri is taken to the local hospital, and there seems to be two films that are taking place.Loomis, who is looking for clues that takes him to the school where he finds that Lauri Strode is Michael's sister, as well as the Samhain reference on the wall, in what appears to be blood, though it has to be asked whose blood it is as no one has been murdered at the school that I can tell. We also have the fake Michael being killed, which really doesn't serve any part of the story that I can tell other than to mock adults/law enforcement because we know better than them, but this dynamic doesn't really work for me as Loomis is a very well accepted hero, though the effect of the car crash immediately going into flames is iconic. At the very heart of this film, there are a lot of images that work, and B movie coolness that is inserted without context or consideration for tone, that are added with the Hollywood problem of throwing money at creative issues.This can be seen in the scene with the child who has the razor in his mouth at the hospital. The new older cast seems to be less interested in pretense of innocence resulting in one of my favorite minor characters in the Halloween franchise with Budd, who sings foul songs and seems to only care about sex, not in the childish sense that he is new to girls, but that he still has rules of girls he won't go after, as this is more welcome to the grown up world where sex is a common occurrence. The kills attempt to begin taking center stage as Michael eventually shows up, after a laughable jump out of the shadows first kill. Once we get to the hospital we really begin to see where all the cooks in the kitchen got their say. . Akad didn't like the razor scene so I wonder just what else was cut. I also have to say that the lighting in the hospital is still dark like the other parts of the film, so much so that even the film makers comment on it in the commentary. It is a film that felt a need to change from the original in more elaborate kills that would include an eye puncture and graphic nudity in the hot tub scene, and want to change the scenery without changing it at all. This is the film that Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't do interviews about. The movie where a character slips and falls to his death, or at least seemingly so, while the idea that they needed to include gore almost apologizes for the superior first film The ending of the film, where Michael dies is a great stunt that includes the image of him crying blood from the eye holes of his mask in front of the sister he is trying to kill after she shoots him in the eyes (good shot), punctuated by an incredible fire stunt. It goes into that formulaic concept of killing the horror icon at the end of each installment that would plague later installments of most franchises. Nothing has topped the simplicity of having the killer go through something that should have killed him and him still be out there trying to kill you that the first film left you with, and after seeing the first film, you assume that Michael is going to keep coming until Laurie is dead, which she does eventually die in Halloween 8, but I'm pretty sure our imaginations did a much better job of filling in the details. "},{"Title":"The Halloween Saga Halloween II","Date":"7 July 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Halloween was a huge box office hit. It made 47 million (157 million adjusted for inflation) on a very low budget and had audiences jumping in their seats time and time again. It was well reviewed and it brought on a slew of imitators that performed well and helped to start a new genre of horror the slasher film. Movies like Happy Birthday to Me and Prom Night (also starting Jamie Lee Curtis) popped up in theatres and, following the same format as Halloween, brought money into the pockets of the filmmakers and fear into the hearts of the audiences.The biggest and most successful of the imitators was Friday the 13th,released two years after Halloween. Pretty much a direct copy ofHalloween, Friday the 13th followed the same formula albeit in a different setting. Set on a campground, the story involves a murder years before, a lead female, a hidden killer who stalks the victims and the use of the killer's perspective complete with the heavy breathing and killer theme music.Friday the 13th was a hit with audiences but unlike Halloween, it played poorly with critics. It focused more on gore and jump-scares than Halloween did and it racked up the body count; 11 deaths compared to Halloween's 4. A year later, a sequel to Friday the 13th followed, following the exact formula that made the first one a success, and again, audiences at it up. The Slasher film was incredibly popular and what better reason to make a sequel to the film that jump started the genre.Halloween II was released on October 30th, 1981, 3 years after the original and many slasher films later. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance returned to their roles playing Laurie Strode and Dr. Loomis respectively. John Carpenter and Debra Hill return as writers and producers but sadly Carpenter did not want to direct the sequel. Instead we get newcomer Rick Rosenthal who does an OK job of replicating Carpenter's style and technique.Taking place literally right after the first film ends, Halloween II pales in comparison to the original. It is not as tightly paced, it isn't as scary, it relies on Michael Myers jumping out of places rather than lurking in the background and it relies on gore more than scares. Halloween II seems more influenced by Friday the 13th and the other pale imitators of Halloween than Halloween itself. That's not to say the film isn't enjoyable but it just feels lack luster in comparison to the original.The film drags a little at parts, it fleshes out connections between characters that aren't really needed (and makes the masked killer less mysterious and therefore less scary), it has some over the top scenes (especially involving Dr. Loomis) and it has a new guy playing Michael Myers who unfortunately doesn't capture the menace of Nick Castle in the first one.The biggest problem with this film, as mentioned earlier, is that it borrows more from than the imitators than the original. Myers isn't really seen in the background, or moving out of blackness and into the frame. He is either right there on screen or he pops up out of nowhere. The first film really emphasized that eerie methodical unknown killer element, always having him looming in the background. He was always there but he took his time and when he killed it was effective. Here he kills and kills, again and again, over and over.The film does pick up and get significantly better in the last half hour, when it becomes Laurie vs. Michael. At this point the movie feels almost like the original as Laurie is stalked through hospital corridors. It's eerie and fun and exciting and foreboding. And when it finally ends, it wraps the story up nicely and leaves the audience satisfied. Unlike the first film there is no ambiguous ending, it finishes the story of Michael Myers, Dr. Sam Loomis and Laurie Strode and finally, like the last shot of the film, allows for the sun to let a little light into the darkness that preceded it.Film Rating 72%Breakdown (How Halloween II scored 72%)Production Design 8 out of 10 Cinematography 8 out of 10 Re-playability 7 out of 10 Originality 5 out of 10 Costumes 9 out of 10 Directing 6 out of 10 Editing 7 out of 10 Acting 8 out of 10 Music 8 out of 10 Script 6 out of 10Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"And the massacre continues...","Date":"27 June 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The indestructible Michael Myers returns in what would be the first of six sequels (Part III however would not feature the legendary bogeyman). What's interesting about the first sequel is that it is a continuation on from the action in the first one, set on the very same night. This was a brilliant idea from Carpenter and Hill, as not many sequels tend to take place exactly where the first movie finished off. We are all familiar with the first film (Well, you should be if you have seen or are planning on watching this) - but the last five minutes or so are recapped for us in which Myers, despite being stabbed in the neck with a knitting needle and shot six times in the chest before falling off a twenty-foot balcony, is still on the loose, and he heads for Haddonfield Hospital where he continues his massacre of the helpless staff and patients, as he hunts for Laurie, the babysitter he had failed to murder earlier that night. Hot on his bloody tail is the high-blood pressured Dr. Loomis, who sets off on a wild goose-chase around the neighbourhoods of Haddonfield with the Sheriff searching for Myers.Unfortunately, John Carpenter was not at the helm for Halloween II, and this is very evident in that the atmosphere is just not the same. It's certainly a far more violent film than the first, as one unfortunate young lady is scalded/drowned in a tub of boiling water. First-time director Rick Rosenthal is at the helm here instead - and in fairness, for a young, first-time film director he did a pretty good job. Rosenthal would go on to direct the Sean Penn film Bad Boys in 1983 and Halloween Resurrection, the final sequel in this franchise in 2002. Although Rosenthal does a good job, this would have been so much better had Carpenter directed. Fortunately, we are blessed with a script from him and Debra Hill, but had it not been for their small contribution, Halloween II certainly runs the risk of being overdone and boring in parts. Watching Dr. Loomis and the Sheriff driving around searching for Myers is quite amusing in the irony of the entire situation - Myers is in the last place they'd expect to find him, but at the same time, it should be quite obvious seeing as how Laurie is at the hospital! Anyway, their gung-ho antics result in the death of a teenager who chose to wear the wrong mask this Halloween.Haddonfield hospital is shockingly understaffed and the lack of security and patients was quite a surprise (Apart from a baby unit, there doesn't appear to be anyone else). This makes the entire story hard to believe, and had there been more people and opposition for Myers to slaughter , this could have been the most bloody and highest body-count in the series. I enjoyed the beginning of the film where we see Myers stalking the residents of Haddonfield as he attempts to flee the police, and there's a nod to Night of the Living Dead as we see two separate people watching the film on TV at different parts of the night (Which leads to a funny plot hole if you are familiar with Night of the Living Dead and pay attention to how much time has passed). When compared to the sequels that would come later on (Season of the Witch - Part III - is by far the best, however, that can hardly be counted as a Michael Myer's sequel) Halloween II is exceptional, as the films would degenerate significantly as they usual do in the franchise. "},{"Title":"He's still on the loose...","Date":"25 June 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" 1981's Halloween II was, like Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), one of those sequels to a mega-grossing box office hit that was pushed into production despite a distinct lack of enthusiasm from the key creative forces behind the initial film. In much the same way that actor Charlton Heston was tempted back to continue the story of his classic original by the promise of reduced involvement in the follow-up's creation, an almost sure-fire guarantee of further box office success, and an opportunity to bring his previously open-ended saga to an (apparently) irrevocable conclusion, original Halloween director John Carpenter agreed to supervise production and provide a screenplay for this sequel to his 1978 hit, even if he left the actual helming duties to the unknown Rick Rosenthal (and then, dissatisfied with the results, ended up shooting some additional sequences for the film himself anyway). Picking up at the exact point the first Halloween left off, the sequel follows the continuing pursuit of near-supernatural stalk-and-slash maniac Michael Myers by both the police and the determined Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence), whilst the injured and traumatised Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken away to recover in a local hospital. However, Myers' near-indestructible nature, coupled with an unexpected new plot revelation, ensures that he hasn't yet quite finished with Laurie... Halloween II is not a particularly well-made or memorable movie, and certainly lacks the atmosphere of terror and expertly-handled scares of the first film; in keeping with the times, and the flood of killer-on-the-loose cack that proliferated in the wake of Carpenter's initial low budget hit, the sequel goes for a gorier, less subtle approach to the theme (though ironically, this was largely down to Carpenter's input, rather than Rosenthal's). Curtis, who, like Carpenter, wasn't keen on returning to the story, isn't as effective here as she was in the original, but at least her continuing presence assists with the continuity, as does that of the wonderful Pleasence, who is excellent in a significantly-expanded encore as the obsessive Loomis. But, without wanting to give anything away to those who haven't seen it, there is no doubt that this second go-round for Michael Myers should have been the last we heard of him (especially given the sequel's seemingly very conclusive ending); unfortunately, the 'low cost, big profit' nature of this kind of horror movie meant that there were no fewer than six more sequels of wildly varying quality to come (including three starring Pleasence and two more featuring Curtis), plus a 2007 remake, and a sequel to that (!). Not bad for a movie madman a lot of people haven't been able to take seriously since Wayne's World (1992) came out... "}{"Title":"Halloween II A Sequel to Scream About","Date":"12 November 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The first Halloween is a genuine classic. In 1981, capitalizing on such a frightening movie's success with a sequel was probably the farthest thing from John Carpenter and Debra Hill's mind. If they were to ever make a sequel, they wouldn't just do it for the money. They'd do it to build on the original's story and to keep Michael Myers scary. Carpenter and Hill sat down to write a script about where The Shape would be now and how he would continue his reign of terror. The end result was Halloween II, and surprise, surprise! It's a sequel that rocks! The film begins right where the first film left off. It's October 31st, 1978. Laurie Strode has had a horrific ordeal after an escaped madman attacked her. She is sent to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to have her wounds treated while Dr. Sam Loomis wanders the streets looking for Michael Myers. We then transition into the hospital to check up on Laurie. What she doesn't know is that The Shape is not dead, and has followed her to the hospital. He roams the hallways, searching every room for his target. Anybody who gets in the way will suffer the consequences.Ordinarily, when people think of sequels, they stay away. They want more than just blood, guts, and naked women hitting the chopping block. They're smarter than that. Luckily, Halloween II doesn't treat its audience like idiots. It respects the original, and keeps its atmospheric and frightening tone. However, it IS a sequel, and when you're making a horror movie in 1981, you have to give the audience what they want to see. There is much more violence and gore in this film than there was in the first. But it goes to show you that Michael Myers is more intimidating. And for those who enjoy their horror movies with a bit of nudity, Halloween II satisfies.While the first Halloween was fairly limited in its setting(it was set in Illinois, but took place mostly in just two houses, which were The Shape's stalking grounds), part 2 expands its environment. We get to see how Michael's murders affect the town of Haddonfield overall. Reporters flock the Wallace and Doyle houses hoping to catch a glimpse of a body. A pack of high school kids cause a riot at the abandoned Myers house, breaking bottles and getting drunk. These events don't go quietly in this town, and they're not just a random occurrence.There is still a great amount of mystery to Michael Myers. We never truly know what he looks like without the mask, and his super-human strength is still quite shocking. He keeps playing his deadly games with his victims before they die, especially in that iconic scene in the therapy room. The twist on why The Shape is after Laurie always stuns the viewer the first time they watch the film, and although it provides more motivation for Michael to kill than in the first film, it still leaves you questioning why he is that way.Another cast of sympathetic and talented leads elevates Halloween II over your average slasher sequel. Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis return as Sam Loomis and Laurie Strode, and both are once again fantastic. Then we get some new faces. Lance Guest is entertaining as Jimmy, a friend of Laurie's who works at the hospital. Other great performances include Pamela Susan Shoop as Karen(an actress with a great rack), Gloria Gifford as Mrs. Alves, Tawny Moyer as Jill, and Leo Rossi as the obnoxious Bud.With Carpenter and Hill only writing the script, the director's chair was filled by newcomer Rick Rozenthal. Of course, he's no John Carpenter, but he understands what made the first Halloween so amazing. He keeps the tension high and stays true to keeping all settings darkened. Rozenthal does a fine job as the director.If the film has any flaws, it's that Jamie Lee Curtis's hair is noticeable as a wig, and Carpenter's music, with some assistance from Alan Howarth, is more 80's and not as simplistically disturbing as the original 1978 score. But otherwise, I enjoyed Halloween II thoroughly. With it, and the 8 films that followed, the Michael Myers mythology stays alive, and is plenty scary. This sequel carves deep, like a knife penetrating a smiling pumpkin.

I wouldn't say that it was a perfect sequel, but it was pretty sexy. It had great suspense, a really good setting for the film and a really cool twist. So, without further a Jew, let's begin!PROS There are a lot of positive things to say about this movie, and I will be covering all of them. First of all, the way the film continues from the first one is genius. I guess John Carpenter got the idea from Sylvester Stallone, you know, because 'Rocky II' continues directly after 'Rocky', and they both recap the events from the previous film. I also enjoyed the setting of this one, Haddonfield General Hospital, it was a creepy atmosphere and it gave Michael Myers a lot of opportunities to find different ways to kill people. I would also like to point out the unintentional humour in the film, one scene when a character slips in blood, falls, and just lies there, I found that kinda funny. The actors who played their characters played them well, with the best one being Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis, who shows a more bad- ass side of himself in this one. We also see more of the hero aspect of the character, as he risks his own life to save Laurie, who was again played exceptionally well by Jamie Lee Curtis. But I just didn't feel for her as much as I did in the original, maybe it's because in this one Michael HAS a reason that he wants to kill her, when in the first one he is after her because he just feels like it. But she was still cool. Some scenes were a bit too 'Friday the 13th'- esque, like when the fat Security Guard was looking around and the Michael Myers cat attacked him. It was corny, but it was fun!CONS The only shitty thing about the film is the music. It's played in EVERY SINGLE SCENE! I mean literally! In scenes when it's just characters talking and no action, IT CONSTANTLY PLAYS! No need! I couldn't even here the freakin' actors! And it's remixed! AND THE REMIX SUCKS!But if you just ignore the crap music and watch the movie, you'll love it as much as the first one. It's scarier, more fun, and is more violent!HALLOWEEN II Starring Donald Pleasance, Jamie Lee Curtis and Dick Warlock Directed by Rick Rosenrhal and John Carpenter "},{"Title":"Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream....","Date":"2 June 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" What is it about Michael Myers that creeps me out? There's a bunch of other horror icons to choose from; Myers is runner-up when it comes to real heavies like Freddy Krueger and Jason Vorhees. Certainly he was one of the first movie-maniacs for many, though not mine (that cherry pop went to momma's boy Jason Vorhees) but that isn't quite it either. Was it the mask? Breathe a sigh of relief that John Carpenter chose the modified captain Kirk look instead of his original choice of clown regalia, it's a lot stranger and striking. Maybe it was his simple yet brilliant goose bump score (which unfortunately is given the full synth treatment here, one of its biggest faults) combined with the Shape's heavy breathing, or Myer's silent implacability and steady stride that always seems to outpace his victims even if they're racing in the opposite direction.Or it could've been his passionless approach to the craft; Freddy and to a lesser extent Jason visibly got off on their murder, making them maybe more accessible. Michael Myers is completely alien, a man-child garbed in a grey mechanic's jump suit, never better than when implementing that old slasher stand-by, the butcher knife. Even when he's playing his ghost sheet prank in number 1 -the rare moment where you get the sense The Shape is digging his new gig- it still feels distinct, not like the sadistic thrill shared by those other monsters. Maybe I'll never pin down exactly what it is that makes Michael Myers for me the scariest of the crop, even among more showy contemporaries like Leatherface and that bastard son of a hundred maniacs, but every time I watch HALLOWEEN (discard superfluous sequels 4, 5,6 & 8 & remakes) I never cease to get creeped out. Not since TERMINATOR has such single-mindedness to annihilate a lone victim been so frightening. The same kind of robotic feedback loop seems to animate the Shape ever onward towards his prey. The fabulous final frames are no less startling Jaime Lee stares dead-eyed into the camera, her mind replaying Michael's consumption by fire in the vacant hospital as closing music, an old chestnut (Mr.Sandman by the Chordettes) juxtaposes brilliantly with her vivid recall of the movie's climax, that damned mask melting as a blazing inferno engulfs his face over a jaunty tune. It inverts the innocent tune it into something horrible- its very haunting. Understated, indelible, it points better than anything towards why Keri Tate of H2O is such a broken human being.A decent sequel.

There's a cut that continues to run on Chiller that completely trashes the film. For some reason, it wasn't good enough to fill time with extra scenes added in for the hack editor that got his hands on this. Whoever it was seems to think that ever cut needs to be logical or he/she could make it better. The opening is trashed, the scene where Ben Tramer gets hit by the car has an alternate take at the end where the deputy tells Brackett about Annie and it's so overacted, it's laughable; scenes are cut into different order, many scenes that worked well (Harold's wife finding the blood on the cutting board, the security guard at the hospital getting it with the hammer, etc - ruined!). If you've seen this cut, you know what I mean. The film was 2/2.5 out of 3 to start with (but a solid enough sequel). This cut makes it a 1 star yawner. Sloppy, hacked and - sad. There's also a version of H20 floating around (Chiller/SyFy) that's equally trashed - probably by the same person. Someone take that guys Avid/Final Cut system away (LOL). As an editor, I was insulted that someone thought they could take a cut of a successful film and try to improve it; it felt like some kid got a hold of imovie and suddenly dubbed himself an editor. SyFy/Chiller should be ashamed for showing these cuts. I know they have to fill time but for Pete's sake, use discretion. I see in the trivia that someone says this sequel faired poorly. Ummm. It was number 1 at the box office for several weeks in 1981, had a budget of about 2.5 mill and made 26 mill. That's a success (especially for 1981). I believe you're referring to Halloween III, which flopped at the box office. Universal decided not to produce another sequel thereafter and Trancas produced Halloween 4 - 5 (released under Galaxy Pictures).Miramax produced 6 and Dimension H20/Resurrection.

In horror films, we could as well state that the only thing that matters is to see blood and gore, with a bit of fear. I don't agree, especially in the case of a franchise. The first ingredient, in my opinion, is a solid pretext to justify the persistence of the killer. Unlike Freddy or Jason, Michael Myers has always been known for its relative &#x96; biological at least &#x96; humanity he's no living dead or malevolent spirit of some kind. So, as long as he's not been decapitated, burned or deaths of the likes, his toughness and refusal to die can still be believed at the end of Halloween; although it can't at the end of H2. Plus, H2 is in direct continuity to Halloween, which is extremely rare in films, no ellipse at all. What matters also, in this solid bond of continuity, is to give the audience something more than a trendy bogeyman, strong characters, rough victims who are inclined to survive better than others and offer some strong resistance to the killer &#x96; not the only heroes in horror movies, also in my opinion. Jamie Lee Curtis/Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasence/Dr Loomis are those very characters and their part bring some enjoyment in the film. Another thing deserves a positive remark the pertinence of the title, it still happens on Halloween night, kids go on with their pranks, ignoring that something serious looms over their head. In modern horror films, the presence of a prankster disguised as the killer, or always making jokes at such a point that nobody believes him when he is actually being murdered, is a recurrence. H2 does not suffer from that type of cliché yet, well, apart from poor Ben Tramer, only evoked in the lines of the first Halloween, being accidentally confused with Myers and dead of combustion after a car rushed to him. On Halloween again, Loomis explains rituals about Samhain in the later part of the film, interesting and a bit creepy, not like the occult nonsense in H6, what a disastrous way to leave the world for Donald Pleasence! Finally, in some ways, I value this film because it still bears the mark of Carpenter in the music score and in the editing. At the pantheon of horror directors sit very few people  Carpenter, Craven, Hooper, Romero (all of them have initiated something of their own Freddy, Leatherface, Myers and the zombies); among the many minor directors (one of them being called Miner! Sorry for the lame pun) Rick Rosenthal almost reaches the talent of the masters, even if Halloween Resurrection has disappointed me. In spite of the relationship between Laurie ans Myers being slightly revealed, the shroud of mystery (another fundamental element of horror) remains about Myers'compulsiveness for rampage, some of the murders in the films are classics and the suspense still works. It is useless to compare H2 to its predecessor because they are not the same of their kind, nevertheless, what they share they can be both watched with an equal pleasure. After H2, the insistence on pursuing the sequels has so far only resulted in tasteless directions and very forgettable stories.

"},{"Title":"Rewatchable.","Date":"26 May 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Halloween 2 is one of those rare occasions when a sequel is as equally enjoyable as the first film. Halloween is technically a much better film than Halloween II, but Halloween II has a higher re-watch rate.Rick Rosenthal gave us a pretty uneven film with H2, and it's rumored that Carpenter had to do a number of re-shoots after trying to make something of Rosenthal's shoddy work.Halloween II picks up directly where Halloween left off. Michael is now carrying around six bullets with him - which should have left him a little slow. But, we all know Mike is one crazy son of a gun and isn't gonna allow six slugs to the torso to slow him down.He kills his way to the medical facility where Laurie is admitted and stalks the eerie halls of Haddonfield Clinic. The clinical setting is truly a saving grace for H2. The whole place is eerie. It's a perfect place to set the film.Halloween 2 climbs the gore pole this time. Instead of relying on suspense throughout, the gore angle is exploited - and poof! - Halloween 2 becomes a bodycount slasher film made popular by films like Friday the 13th and The Burning.Nevertheless, H2 does a really good job. There's some good stalk sequences. Jamie Lee hardly has any dialog this time. She's left in a virtual state of 'unspeaking' as she does what she does best...run from masked killers. (Although, she's not doing much running. She's pretty much incapacitated and limps heavily) Donald Pleasance is still putting on quiet a show. He proved even more so that he's obsessed with Myers, eventually throwing his on well being on the line to try and end the reign of terror inspired by Myers.Anyway, there's a little 'unevenness' throughout, but it's still manageable. The editing looks as if it was done by a five year old. but we're able to overlook this and see this for the giant cheese spectacle it really is.Great atmosphere. Creepy location. Everything that made part one famous, but on a more sporadic level. This doesn't mean it's done better, but in a broader theatrical sense considering the body-count slasher film was in it's explosion at the time.

The whole curse with the little girl was pretty okay. But I think they should do a remake of the first Halloween. If they do, it better not be lame, like the Freddy VS Jason idea.

I have seen an alternate version which technically is a director's cut, It has all the scares but is less graphic and has some subtle differences. It was rumored that John Carpenter was brought in to re-shoot many of the sequences to make studio execs happy. This is the version we have all seen many times. The original version I like better because it's more true to the original Halloween less graphic but delivers the goods. This rarely seen version I'd rate an 8 and would love to buy it on video if it becomes available. This version also has a slightly different ending. "},{"Title":"Evil Never Dies","Date":"2 August 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Halloween II picks up right where the first film left off, with Michael Myers pumped full of bullets courtesy of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). But while he may be down, he's anything but out, and has followed Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where she's receiving treatment for her injuries. Haunting the hospital's deserted hallways, Myers makes use of medical equipment on whomever he finds in ways that the AMA certainly wouldn't approve. While Laurie tries to evade her would be killer, Dr. Loomis obsessively hunts Myers, leading to a fiery conclusion.Taking over for director John Carpenter, Rick Rosenthal (who would return to the franchise more than 20 years later with Halloween Resurrection) lacks the style that made the original Halloween so memorable. Nevertheless there are some scary and gruesome incidents as Michael dispatches of the hospital staff in his search for Laurie. In fact, the sequel is a bit gorier than its predecessor, adding more to the shock value quotient. Rosenthal also uses POV shots as effectively as Carpenter did, adding to the illusion that we're seeing events through Myers' eyes. Rosenthal also knows how to use shadows and darkness, making things seem scarier than they are. Must mention the Camera Angels are once again CLASSIC.The script by John Carpenter and Debra Hill essentially gives us more of the same. The setting is changed to a hospital, and it's revealed that Laurie is Michael's sister, but little else is added to the night Myers came home. As for the concept that Michael Myers is possessed by the Celtic Lord of the Dead - that innovative concept is mentioned, but never really explored. Which is kind of for the best.Plenty of care was put into the character of Michael Myers. He's shown to be not just an insane killer, as he avoids killing an elderly couple and walks the streets of Haddonfield trying to look innocuous. Myers is shown to be quite intelligent, coming across as a man with a mission. This added trait makes him stand out from the pack of lunatic imitators, and sets him up as an Classic Horror Icon.Jaime Lee Curtis is fair as Laurie Strode, but she shows none of the spirit she had in the original, and mainly looks like she's having some sort of out of body experience. Lance Guest does a good job as her would-be boyfriend, projecting sensitivity and compassion that makes him a likable character. Too bad he dies by slipping on a pool of blood and hitting his head; But it's Donald Pleasence, as Dr. Loomis, who steals the film. Pleasence has the right blend of desperation, single-mindedness and fear that makes him the centerpiece player in the franchise. You can even feel his commanding presence even when Loomis is off screen.The second Halloween film, while not quite as good as the first, It comes pretty close, and is still a very entertaining entry. More importantly, it sets up ideas that come into play in future sequels. Overall, Halloween 2 is a scary and effective treat, and the final classic of the Halloween Franchise.

It has a certain way of mixing in with the action now and really give it a scary sensation.The plot of this movie is very good. Michael is still loose and he is still looking for Laurie, who is taken to the local hospital. The town is slowly becoming informed of the brutal murders and many are scared. Laurie is in the hospital, scared, and confused of what is going on. Michael is hot on her tracks, as he makes his way through the hospital to find her on the night he came home.I gotta say its pretty well done. The mask is noticeably different, he looks a little dirty. The some scares are somewhat predictable, others are really shocking. The best scene is were he finally meets back up with Laurie.

Michael has already killed one sister and is determined to murder the other before the night is over.This sequel to the 1977 classic Halloween isn't too shabby. It's a little more exploitative than the first. The murders are gorier and the blood is brighter and more generously splashed around. The victims are far more vacuous in this installment and we're given no time at all to see them develop or to care about them before they are stabbed, desanguinated or boiled to death. However, I do like the way in which all of the loose threads are tied up in this one and the tidy explanation is pretty believable. This is a straightforward, unapologetic slasher film which still manages to be a hell of a lot better than many of its modern day contemporaries. "},{"Title":"Very Respectable Sequel But Unrealistic!","Date":"20 October 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Well Halloween II is a very respectable sequel to its classic predecessor, and probably the scariest horror sequel ever produced. However this has to be the most unrealistic film of the Halloween series. Halloween II seems to have had a major number of flaws. To start out the window that Michael falls out of in the pre credits is different from the one he fell out of at the end of the first film. Afew minutes later Dr. Loomis claims that he shot Michael six times when it was actually a total of seven. Later on Michael makes his way to the hospital where Laurie is in her convalescence from her previous encounter from the masked fiend. The hospital is where most of the goof ups are obviously noticed. Haddonfield Memorial must be the most laid back hospital in the world. What do we notice about this hospital. Well here are a few examples There seems to be only one doctor and he performs his duties while under the influence. Laurie might as well of had Michael work on her. There are only 4 nurses and 1 security guard. It also seems to be legal for paramedics to smoke some weed in the break room. It's no wonder why Michael was able to sneak in undetected and dispatch nearly everyone in the hospital. The hospital seems to be so quiet that two staff members get a chance to fraternize with each other in the facility's therapy tub. Well the hot tub scene may be the most memorable scene of the entire Halloween series. Yes, the actress who portrayed nurse Karen sure had a fine body for the early '80's. I wish I could work at a hospital with such a lovely nurse. It's a shame her demise had to be so gruesome and agonizing. After all her it wasn't her idea to go mess around in the hot tub. Maybe she got it that way for picking such a crude and obnoxious jerk for a boyfriend. She should've chosen Jimmy instead. While Michael is having his way at the hospital, the police and Dr. Loomis are trying to figure out where exactly Michael Myers may be. Here is where we have some more flaws. The Haddonfield Police seem to be just as inept as the medical staff at the hospital. Not only did they not question Laurie about what happened, they didn't even think about Myers being in the hospital at all. If a suspect has been shot the hospital would be an obvious choice to look, or at least inform the hospital to put out an APB as well as other locations. As we near the climax of the film Dr. Loomis is on his way back to Smith Grove due to orders from the governor. While he is in the marshal's car the nurse tells him the shocking news that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister and that's why he came home to Haddonfield. Loomis forces the Marshal to return to Haddonfield in an attempt save Laurie and stop Michael.Well this is where most of us thought the series at least with Michael Myers was officially over. Dr. Loomis decides to blow up the room that he and Laurie are hiding in due to fact the Loomis opened up the the oxygen tanks. This is when we assume that both the doctor and his seemingly supernatural patient burn to death. Obviously, when Halloween 4 comes out we learn that both of them have miraculously survived the inferno. If anybody is wondering about the third installment, it's a completely different story from the other films in the Halloween franchise. Despite the film taking place on the same night from the original film, Halloween II had it's fair share scares and suspense to make it a very respectable slasher film. For anybody who is into the old school horror icons such as Michael and Jason from the Friday the 13th films, I'd definitely recommend watching this one if you haven't seen this one yet.

Carpenter's films have a habit of ending with a cliffhanger, and fans wanted to see whether Michael would return. He does, just as Laurie is taken to a nearby hospital. Loomis is still on the prowl, and Michael follows Laurie to hospital intent on finishing his work, killing any unfortunate doctors, nurses or patients who get in his way. Once again Laurie and Michael are alone to chase and fight to the death.Unfortunately, this for the most part seems like a cash in, and is a much inferior sequel complete with weaker performances and more elaborate deaths. There are good points though, Curtis and Pleasance are still great, while the setting is quite atmospheric. Many of the original cast come back for a short while, keeping us interested with the plot, and there are plenty of deaths. However, much of the film does lack the tension which Carpenter can easily create, and we do not care about any of the new characters. Michael now seems to be unstoppable which further distances us from the reality of the first film.

Much of this bore is set in a hospital as he very, very slowly goes about his killing machine business. Donald Pleasence does his mad doctor bit again spouting some crackpot dialogue in a strange, offbeat way. No one listens to him, of course and they end up dead.It's an okay sequel but it's marred by unbearable slowness. The pace for that particular night was already set by the first film so why slow down and build up again? Regarded as a classic far too often the first film is somewhat obsolete today. But it does have one purpose to always look good when compared to the drek of 'horror' we suffer today. This first sequel, coming a mere three years after the original, already looks tired and the thin premise is stretched to breaking point. There's no purity or class here.Plus it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. What happened to Jimmy? He died by gently banging his head but didn't keel over until 20 minutes later? What? Why do the credits list someone playing Michael Myers (Age 23) when he is only 21 in the film and is played by Dick Warlock? Why did he kill the Sheriff's daughter (which he does again in Revenge)? This new DVD from Universal improves upon the cruddy Goodtimes release by giving us a new 2.351 anamorphic picture and a sturdy keepcase instead of a horrid snapper.

The movie did well but most critics hated it. The differences are subtle and if you see it you will know the difference even the ending is slightly different.

Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) goes to the hospital and Michael Myers is still on the loose. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is still looking for him, but it seems that Dr. Loomis hadn't learned of one thing It seems that Laurie Strode is Michael Myers sister.He realizes that the whole reason Michael came back to Haddonfield was to kill his other sister. Michael goes through the town killing people in his way and also kills the employees at the hospital to get to Strode.What I love about the Halloween sequels is that they aren't as bad as other horror movie sequels. Only 2 bad sequels came out of the Halloween series, and they aren't even bad compared to other sequels released for other movies. Halloween III came out and everyone expected to see Michael Myers back. Instead, the whole Michael Myers thing was over and the plot was totally different. The Michael Myers character didn't return until the heavily under rated Halloween IV. The other horrible sequel that recently came out was Halloween Resurrection, which was just so bad I won't even go in depth. People go into the old Myers' house to be on TV, but Michael comes home.The Halloween series is the best of the best, people! Halloween 9 is set to come out this year, and I can't wait. Michael Myers is and will forever be the best horror movie killer ever. The movie wasn't ruined by all of its' sequels and the music themes are some of the best in cinema. The Halloween themes are absolutely incredible. They honestly touch me each time I hear them. It's hard to describe, but they get the viewer so into the movie.While most horror movies glorify violence these days, the Halloween series didn't start to become as violent as other films until the 4th or 5th sequel. The 2nd has more blood in it then the first, but it's done in such a genious way, that you don't actually see someone being stabbed and ripped open. It's just a great sequel to the best horror movie in cinema history. -Pat8/10  "},{"Title":"A perfect Sequal","Date":"20 July 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  This instalment starts where the orignal ended Laurie Strode is taken to the hospital with injuries and Micheal Myers has 6 bullets in him and somehow lived.

Afetrall, by the time that the sequel had been released we had also been given the Friday 13th saga and so it was becoming a bit commonplace. Lookin back in retrospect though, we are able to see that the two fit together nicely, the sequel in some ways even going to surpass some of its predecessors features..The body count for example is a lot higher so those of you who like their slashers to have lots of inventive and fun death scenes, you will enjoy!!death by scalding swimming pool? Check! death by blood being drained through a drip? Check! death by syringe in the eye? CheckOuch, ouch and double ouch!!  The explanation of the relationship between Michael and Laurie is very credible yet sad but the performances of the main characters are strong. Sure, some of the bit players tend to read their lines as if they are porn stars but we dont mind that because it is a staple ingredient of a horror film..you need the cheesy boys and girls who get naked and then die horrible deaths (see swimming pool reference above). The only thing i really wish was that you could feel a little more involved with some of the doctors and nurse because half the time you are just waiting for em to peg it. With films such as Scream, teh secondary characters are developed as much as the leading roles..and it makes tehir deaths even more poignant. Also, how did Jimmy actually die in this film? can somebody please answer me that question!!?Overall a good sequel, that is still enjoyable to watch!  "}{"Title":"one of my favorite entries in the entire series","Date":"18 May 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  I have an interesting way of looking at Halloween 2. I don't look at it as being better or worse than it's predecessor, because I don't think of it as a sequel-it's more like an extension of the original, so I look at them both as one movie. This started one night when I watched H1, then right as it ended, I popped in the Universal DVD of H2. Granted, there are a few errors here and there(a couple of minor anachronisms; in the first Halloween, Michael falls off the back balcony after being shot, here he falls out the front, plus the infamous 7 shots goof), but then again, this was made 3 years later, so it's not going to be perfect. Beyond all that, however, the two of them go together very well. H2 picks up right where Halloween ended. Michael is shot and falls out the window right into the yard, and is nowhere to be found when Dr. Loomis peers down from the balcony. Laurie Strode is taken by ambulance to the hospital and is loaded up on morphine(she is in a coma for half the film). The whole thing starts off at a somewhat slow pace-most of the first half is spent following Michael around as he tracks down his prey, following Dr. Loomis and Sheriff Brackett as they track down Michael, and following various hospital staff as they go about their work. Eventually though, Michael makes his way to Haddonfield Memorial, and as the body count starts to climb, so does the suspense. Adding to it all is a startling revelation about Michael's obsession with killing Laurie(they're long lost brother and sister. Two years after Michael was committed to the mental institution, their parents died in a car accident. Shortly after, Laurie was adopted by the Strode family, who asked that the records be sealed to protect Laurie, as well as themselves), and when they finally meet up, the film kicks into overdrive and leaves you on edge all the way up to the (literally) explosive ending-the scene where right after the operating room blows up, Michael slowly walks out of the fire and collapses-freaks the s**t out of me every time).With Rick Rosenthal directing, H2 has a much darker vibe than the original, from the opening credits(another pumpkin, except instead of burning out when it gets close to the camera, it slowly rips in half to reveal a skull) to the more gothic sounding score(mostly piano in H1, here the synthesizers run the show) to a higher body count, not to mention a healthier dose of gore(a doctor found dead with a syringe sticking out of his eye, a nurse getting drowned in water so hot it makes her skin peel, Dr. Loomis getting stabbed in the stomach). Another cool little trick I liked-where the camera gives us Laurie Strode's point of view while she's loaded up on morphine, and the view is all blurry(another scene that always creeps me out-the one where it;s her drugged up POV watching Michael stab nurse Jill in the back with the scalpel).The acting, while not great, is solid for a slasher flick. Jamie Lee Curtis, while comatose for most of the film, is great in her scenes, and while Michael was scary enough when he was played by Nick Castle, with Dick Warlock behind the mask he is f***ing EVIL. Jimmy(Lance Guest)seems like the only member of the hospital staff who gives a damn about Laurie(and he does a nice job of showing it), and of course Donald Pleasance(rest in peace, sir) turns in a stellar performance as our selfless hero, Dr. Loomis.H2 could have effectively ended the Myers saga, but after H3 was so poorly received, Moustapha Akkad and Co. decided to bring it back........again and again and again. To me the first 4 are the best(and yes that includes H3 Season of the Witch), with H1 and H2 tied for Number 1. **** out of 5.

Michael of course goes to the clinic with some new victims left behind and proceeds to slay the staff making his way to Laurie who once again must face pure evil. Jamie Lee Curtis isn't in many scenes. In the first hour she's almost absent. They take her to the hospital, drug her and she sleeps until finally Michael comes for her. That is also the worst part of the movie with Loomis running around town and the characters at the hospital being introduced. The first deaths are really quick and at that time I was starting to feel this was another bad sequel to cash in on the original. However once Michael goes on a rampage the movie is great. We get breasts; we get needles shoved in eyes and huge pools of blood. The chase sequence is filled with suspense and tension and the ending is quite spectacular. Once the credits roll in we realize that the first part is not all that bad and that we just had a lot of fun. According to imdb Carpenter shot some gory scenes believing Rick Rosenthal' 's version was too tame which means that without his Midas touch this would probably be a dull and fairly awful sequel. This way it's actually a great horror movie. Too bad Jamie Lee isn't in it more. A final note to the fantastic score. I love I mean absolutely love that opening theme.

After Michael Myers was shot by Dr. Sam Loomis he simply disappeared, but here hes very much on the loose and butchers an attractive young lady called Alice just down the road from the Doyle residence.Meanwhile Laurie Strode is taken to Haddonfield Hospital unaware that the mad killer (now a zombie who won't die) is still after her blood.This sequel is actually an excellent 'Volume 2' companion next to John Carpenter's original classic. The budget is much bigger, the murders and gory moments are more graphic and Michael Myers is more of a quiet rampaging monster rather than the ghostly 'shape' before. Carpenter's music score has been given more of a catchy remix by Alan Howarth and a dose of 'Electronic Realization' whenever Myers murders somebody.The nurses in this movie are all very attractive, special mention must go to Pamela Susan Shoop for her spectacular performance as Nurse Karen with Leo Rossi in the Hospital Therapy Room. When she drops her white towel to reveal a gorgeous figure, Halloween II becomes a near Masterpiece because you know these lovers are going to be murdered. We've seen Shoop's fantastic breasts so we are also going to see her gruesome death and gruesome it most certainly is. Michael Myers drowns her head in the scalding Therapy pool, in what must be the most horrifying scene in the entire movie before ruthlessly dumping her body to the side like disgusting garbage.Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis are as good as ever, the final showdown between Myers, Loomis and Curtis should really have been the perfect demise for the shape, but Halloween producers sensing a dollar to be made brought him back in the lamentable Halloween 4.The ending of this film is terrific. I love it when Michael Myers gets shot in the eyes by Laurie and starts lashing around the Hospital operating theatre while there's this beating background music playing like someone's heartbeat, when Dr. Loomis turns on numerous gas cannisters that beating gets louder and louder until Laurie makes good her escape and Loomis blows himself up alongside his zombie monster patient.With gruesome gory mainstream horror than the more art-house original, Rick Rosenthal's Halloween II is the best sequel (and original conclusion) to the Halloween story.

How the filmmakers blew this one I will never know. They had the blueprints of a classic original topped with one of the creepiest killers in movie history. Where does it all go wrong? Let me count a few of the ways.First we are not given any new characters to care about. If you're going to make a sequel and keep the main characters from the original off screen for periods of time then you had better give us people we care about. Give us people we can root for. Don't introduce them and then kill them off. If the director doesn't care about his characters then why should we? Also, why keep Donald Pleasance off screen so much? It appears he has the lead but if you look closely he comes and goes quickly in each scene save for the last fifteen minutes. Another blown opportunity was getting rid of Charles Cypher's character no more then 15 minutes into the movie. Yes he lost his daughter Annie but give him the strength, as sheriff of Haddonfield, to join the hunt with Donald Pleasance. Then we REALLY would have cared.Second and most important is the violence/suspense level. In the original Michael Myers stalked his prey. He watched them from a far and up close and we, the audience, went crazy with anticipation because the level of suspense is so thick. Michael Myers had a purpose in killing the victims he chose. There was nothing random about it and we knew it too. In Halloween 2 all of that is thrown out the window in the very first scene after the credits. Michael attacks a young woman just outside her house for no apparent reason except to kill. Right there we know it's going to be a cheat. Sure enough every victim is random. There is no purpose to these characters dying except that most of them were unfortunate enough to work in a hospital.The violence level is ten notches higher here than in the original. In sickening detail we see a hammer to the forehead, a needle in the eye, a woman scalded to death and so on. At the 60 minute mark Halloween 2 had become nothing more then a geek show with no intentions of trying to live up to the class of the original.I could go on and on with the flaws. A huge hospital with mostly dark corridors and seemingly only one patient in the whole place? A weakened character able to squeeze off two pinpoint shots hitting someone in each eye? The silly and not very original connection between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. It goes on and on.Still Halloween 2 has a few good moments. I liked the recap of the original's ending to open this film with Donald Pleasance telling a neighbor You don't know what death is. Also the presence of Michael Myers is truly creepy and very effective.The biggest disappointment is that Halloween is a classic horror film that, sadly, spawned hundreds of imitators that were all worse then the one before. Halloween 2 proved it was no better then any of the other imitators.

True, the film tends to stop and start here and there and a lot of the sequences tend to be drawn out a bit and scenes which worked like a treat in the original film do not work as well here. For all that though, the atmosphere and the style of this sequel are more than a compensation.The widescreen version recently released by Sanctuary in the UK has helped my opinion in commenting on the film. Scenes in the pan and scan version which weren't as clear are now even more so. A different location does not a good movie make and the fact that the film is set primarily in a hospital should have only been a small part of the film. The backstory of Myers and his relationship to Laurie is not touched on as much as possible and the hospital characters are not as thought out, merely becoming cyphers and victims in the film. Use of CCTV camera is a neat little touch at times and the dark style of the film, lit impeccably by Dean Cundey (still to make his mark with films like BACK TO THE FUTURE and THE THING)The key problem with HALLOWEEN II is that there isn't as much suspense as there was in the original film.

Jamie Lee Curtis, traumatized and appearing dazed throughout most of the movie, gets chased around a hospital by durable, long-lasting serial killer Michael Myers (he should have been the spokesman for Energizer batteries instead of that damn bunny.)  The body count (mostly cute nurses) is higher, the murders more graphic, but, other than a few frightening chase scenes through deserted hospital corridors, this one falls short of its former glory.

After believing he has dispatched The Shape (Dick Warlock) with six shots from his gun, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) soon discovers that he has gotten up and walked off into the night. The Shape has, in fact, pursued Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the only survivor of the evening's earlier rampage, to the world's most understaffed and poorly lit hospital, while the obsessive Dr. Loomis rants and raves about finding his former patient. This nasty, mean-spirited and needlessly violent sequel lacks virtually all the merit of the original, replacing style and atmosphere with excessive gore and sadism that would make Jason Voorhees cringe. Curtis's role is reduced to a whimpering idiot and Pleasance's scenery-chewing is unintentionally hilarious. A few good moments are drowned out by such gratuitous scenes of cruelty as a kid with a razor blade stuck in his mouth, a woman's face being burned off in boiling water and an innocent teen getting hit by a police car. It's obvious the writer-producer team of John Carpenter and Debra Hill knew they couldn't recapture the chilling terror of the original and decided to concentrate on gory set-pieces to compete with other slasher fare such as Friday THE 13TH and MY BLOOD VALENTINE.The biggest problem with HALLOWEEN II, however, is giving Michael Meyers a back story involving Laurie being his sister. This makes the character far less mysterious and therefore less scary. Also, the deep blackness of the Shape mask's eyeholes is now replaced with a pair of demented-looking eyes staring out (one of which has miraculously healed from being poked out with a hanger). This further changes The Shape from The Boogeyman into an all-too non-supernatural psycho.And can anyone tell me what Mr. Sandman has to do with anything?

Some have said thisfilm is slow, stupid and long. It isn't really, sure there are someslow moments, the deaths can be a little too extravagant and thereis literally dozens of plot holes but the film is still frightening andvery suspensful, sometimes more so than the original. The filmbegins at the climax of 'Halloween' where Michael Myers, a serialkiller just escaped from the asylum, is shot off a balcony butdissapears. Psychiatrist Doctor Loomis (Donald Pleasance in hisgreatest role besides Blofeld) goes in search of him while neardead victim Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to a veryempty hospital. All is not well though, Michael is still loose and veryquickly he has murdered his next victim and once again escaped.Meanwhile, Laurie is lying in hospital, knowing that MIchael is afterher and is soon to learn a worse secret Michael Myers is herbrother and when their parents died, Laurie, only a baby at thesime, was adopted by the Strode family. A very 'Star Wars'-esquestate of events indeed but their is force in this movie. Myers is apure killing machine with no emotions and clearly enjoys hissadistic escapades very much in this film and later in 'Halloween4'. Some people may think of the 'Halloween' series as just yournormal slasher films, they are beginning to turn into that with therelease of 'Halloween 8' but all 8 of them are still quite fun but thefirst four are the best, with plenty of MIchael Myers and theMyer-less 'Halloween 3 The Season of the Witch' is not as bad aseveryone has said, at least not in my opinion. Meanwhile,'Halloween 2' is still a good film. The directing by Rick Rosenthalis alright but it's the segments specially shot by John Carpenterthat really ties the film together and the script, while sloppy inplaces is very enjoyable. One thing a lot of people agree on aboutthis film is that Dick Warlock is the best Michael Myers. The walk,the mask, those haunting eyes... Warlock has captured everythingbrilliantly and it saves some of the weaker parts of the film.Warlock also appears as Patrolman 3 but I've never figured outwhich one that is!

Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) has just shot Michael Myers several times, and Michael's main victim, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), is cowering against a wall. Michael Myers survived being shot and the fall from the balcony, and has vanished from where he landed on the ground. Loomis meets with the sheriff (Charles Cyphers) to let him know Michael is still on the loose, and Laurie is taken to the hospital. Michael Myers learns Laurie has been taken to the town's hospital from a radio report, and crosses the town to continue his attempts to murder her. In the meantime, the police continue to look for Michael. A nurse from the first Halloween (Nancy Stephens) shows up with a marshal to transport Loomis back to the psychiatric hospital where Michael escaped. Possible SPOILERS Michael arrives at the hospital in search of Laurie, and kills anyone he comes in contact with. Laurie seems aware that Michael will be coming after her again, and tries to get away from the area. Eventually Michael does find Laurie, and chases after her. Dr. Loomis learns Laurie is actually Michael's younger sister, and by gunpoint orders the marshal to drive them to the hospital. Halloween II lacks the style and atmosphere of the original film. This is not to say there isn't any atmosphere at all in Halloween II, because there is mood and atmosphere in spots. The sound of police and ambulance sirens passing through the town add a nice touch, and so do the empty, barely lit hospital corridors. However, it does not seem logical that a hospital would have barely lit corridors! It also does not seem logical a hospital of its size would have such a small night staff. Also illogical is the fact that it seems the hospital's only other patients besides Laurie are a group of newborn babies. Well, there is the one totally exploitive, drop-in emergency patient A little boy who had gotten a razorblade jammed in his mouth while eating a Halloween treat. The film contains illogical matters such as a cat leaping (more like thrown) out of a trash dumpster where it had been trapped, and a nurse totally ignoring her job to have a nude romp with an ambulance attendant in the therapy room's hot tub. Halloween II delves into more exploitation than the first film, and the murders are bloodier, gorier, and more graphic. The addition of graphic murders, extra profanity, and more nudity drags Halloween II down style-wise, and the film's style just doesn't match up to the first Halloween. There seemed to be a desire to have a high body count with this film, which is very much unlike the first film. Michael Myers used only large carving knives in the original, and in this film he uses a variety of instruments to murder. A higher and bloodier body count and the changing of murder implements may have come about due to the slasher genre being in full swing back in 1981, but these changes really diminish the feel, style and atmosphere from the first Halloween. -In this case, excess did more harm than good. The acting in Halloween II is fine. The film does contain some thrills, chills and suspense, and it does have its share of mood lighting. John Carpenter's simple but classic score is repeated in a more intense manner, which seems to be fitting for this sequel. Michael Myers seemed to be after Laurie because she came the closest to his boyhood home in the first Halloween. He seemed obsessed to stalk her and the people she was in contact with that night. In Halloween II it is learned Laurie is Michael's younger sister, which is the explanation for his murderous pursuit...A plot twist I never cared for. The end result Halloween II lacks the style and atmosphere of the original Halloween and it is a mediocre film, but it still makes a seasonable choice for a Halloween horror film line-up.

We certainly wouldn't take our sick dog to this hospital or its staff, but that just adds to the fun. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't quite retain the naiive, fresh look she had from part one, but Michael Myers looks as sinister as ever. His slow walk with that big knife and expressionless face, as he stalks his prey is classic. Donald Pleasance is great and keeps the movie together. The final scene in the small room with the oxygen tanks is a fitting climax to the film. Other Halloween films have come out, but they do not come close to the cult status of the original, or its sister movie. To me, it is sad that Michael Myers did not die with Halloween II. Later versions had Michael Myers walking very quickly at his victims, they changed his facial make-up, and had scenes where he stabbed repeatedly. I always say, if you are going to kill people in the movies. atleast do it right. Do not over-kill as they say. But, Halloween II got it right, and it joins the original Halloween as a cult classic.

Shows the closing moments of the original (albeit with some different, but pretty damn good, music and goes from there. Myers is still on the loose in Haddonfield, while Loomis & Bracket look for him. There's some good stuff in the opening half hour with Myers killing another teen (good tension) and finding out where Laurie is at the hospital.SECOND 30 MINS Lets the film down big time; little time is spent with Laurie, while the action switches over to the idiotic doctors and nurses at the hospital (including the moronic Bud). The kills are a lot gorier this time around (the hot tub, the needle in the eye, hammer in skull, etc.). Mostly this portion of the film is simply boring.FINAL 30 MINS Takes control again- a good chase w/ Laurie & Myers through the hospital (w/ suspense at the elevator), revelation that Laurie is Michael's sister and the confrontation w/ Myers & Loomis at the hospital. Explosive. Myers walking through the flames after the explosion is one of the most amazing visuals, for me, in the entire series. It's a good finish to the film, and it's shocking that both Myers & Loomis survived to H4!OVERALL Out of 10, I'd give it about a 6. The boring middle lets it down.

Includes a surprise (or, well, by now who missed it, but anyhow), creating an easy excuse for a bunch of sequels.

Having the sequel follow right where the first one left off, where the action takes place in a hospital was a much better choice than placing the setting a few years later in a Chicago high rise building.  However, two problems did plague this movie.     Why was the hospital such short-staffed?  I realize Haddonfield was supposed to be a small town and that visiting hours were already over, but I would think even small towns staff larger numbers of hospital personnel after visiting hours.  How could one hospital be run with only one doctor, four nurses, two ambulance drivers and one security guard?  That bugged me!  It really did.  To correct this problem I would have cast another doctor, another patient and a janitor.  Second, I would have eliminated the maternity ward and assigned Nurse Karen to work alongside the other nurses.  Next, I would add a scene explaining that the hospital was actually a clinic, which deals only with minor cases; major cases are sent to the county hospital located several miles away.  Then, when Laurie arrives at the clinic, I would have cast a few more nurses, doctors and visitors as extras.  A scene would be included to show the security guard announcing that visiting hours were over, and the visitors would then leave.  A extra nurse would tell Nurse Janet that her shift is over, and she's leaving.  A later scene would show the extra doctors and nurses as they exit the clinic, leaving behind the main cast.  Among these corrections I would also place more emphasis on Michael Myer's stalking than on his killing.  I think these corrections would help lend credibility to this movie and put this movie on the same level as a the original Halloween.

I know that it was made because the first film made a nice amount of money but for some reason I can just tell they tried to keep it on par with the original. In some aspects they succeed but in the end we get a routine horror sequel. I guess it's unfair to expect so much out of it but when you're the follow up to a well made horror film it's pretty hard not to.The main problem with this sequel is that it moves entirely too slow and the one location it stays in(the hospital) gets boring pretty fast. As Michael slowly stalks the halls we get the feeling that the film is also moving at the same pace. Another problem is that it follows the slasher routine by adding characters that are just there to be victims for our killer. The characters in the first film were likable and were pretty developed, even if you knew they all wouldn't make it to the last frame. In this film we get total brain-dead characters who are just asking to be taken out by Myers. The only new character worth mentioning is the character of Jimmy played by Lance Guest. He gives a decent performance and is the only ne character added to the mix worth mentioning.One issue that most Halloween fans debate about is whether or not The Shape, as he is commonly called, needed a backstory. I admit that in the first film is total lack of a motive made him much more frightening because it wasn't reason that was driving him to kill, it was just the fact that he was pure evil. In this film the reason he is after Laurie is revealed and it does kinda strip that aspect of the character and make him less scary. However, for story purposes for this sequel, it would be pretty hard to have a 90 minute film and not explain anything about its killer. For this film in particular i appreciate the fact that they added a method to his madness, it just brings down his fright level a few notches. At least the explanation is well-crafted and comes as some sort of a surprise.A definite highlight of the film is that it picks up on the same night of the original. It added a level of suspense and consistency that made the story in the sequel much more interesting.Donald Pleasance gets more screentime in this film and you can tell he is having fun with the role. He's quite good in this film and maintains the same dignity that made his character likable in the original. Jamie Lee Curtis gets less screentime in this film. She's still good in this film but more of her would've been appreciated. I also wish we could've seen more of the strong powerhouse that we saw in the original but she is still effective in her scenes. Michael Myers himself is given more screentime something i wish would not have been doen. He was a far more threatening presence when he was reduced to the shadows and the background throughout most of the original. More of him makes him less scary.In the end it's a fairly good sequel to the original i just wish it could've stayed away from the 80's slasher mantality that made Friday the 13th so popular. However when the essence of the original shines through in this film you begin to think it's a cut above its many imitators "},{"Title":"Routine sequel","Date":"27 April 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  spoilersOne viewing of the first Halloween sequel will immediately confirm that it was designed for commercial, not creative, purposes. This fact is probably the main focus in the critical texture of the film, as James Berardinelli indicated. It's a passable follow-up, competently made, but lacks the artistry of the original. In fact, I believe John Carpenter himself expressed his dissatisfaction with the results. It panders to the slasher formula by including more graphic bloodshed for the sake of profit. I think we could have gone by without the infamous hot tub scene, for example.In honoring the conventions of eighties horror, most of the characters are disposable at best, obnoxious at worse. At least one character is so grating that we actively root for Michael to kill him, a complete reversal of what its predecessor accomplished. Otherwise, most of the young cast generates our indifference, not our sympathy. However, I liked Lance Guest, although I wished he was given more to do. It doesn't help that is ultimate fate is unresolved. (In the television cut, he indeed survives, but that does not excuse the filmmakers from neglecting this loose end.) Donald Pleasance, reprising the role of Dr. Loomis, is entertaining in an over-the-top performance, but Jamie Lee Curtis is wasted until the third act.Let's talk about the structure of the film as a whole. It picks up right after the original left off, as Michael Myers continues his business. The first part is fairly entertaining in that regard, although not nearly as eerie as the original. The midsection is strictly average slasher fare, tedious and disjointed to boot. However, the film is somewhat redeemed by an entertaining finale, as Laurie Strode (Curtis) awakens, only to be pursued by Michael. This portion of the film managed to engage me; it's everything a slasher should be tight and suspenseful, but by then, it's too little, too late. Too bad; if the whole thing was like that, I'd recommend it with no reservations.** (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures  "},{"Title":"As good as the first.......","Date":"13 April 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  Halloween II is a great follow up to the original.

Michael Myers escapes, despite being shot 6 times (Which Donald Pleasance clarifies dozens of times throughout the flick) and Laurie Strode is taken to the hospital. For the first half hour, Dr. Loomis (played by Pleasance) and the Sheriff are hunting for Myers throughout the quiet town of Haddonfield. An accident involving someone with the Myers mask on leads them to believe that he might be dead, but that is far from the truth, and Mikey is on his way to visit Laurie at the hospital. Halloween II isn't even close to the magnitude of the original Halloween, but then again, it's a sequel, and none of the other sequels in the series even comes close to the original. The first 20 minutes are a chore to sit through, but once you get through that, the movie gets better and more intense. Michael seems a lot angrier in this installment, and the effort in his murdering shows. I think the hospital was the perfect setting for this movie to take place in. It allows for a lot of roaming on Michael's part and a lot more creative killings and tools to pull them off with. We get more gore in this one and WAY MORE nudity than in the first (Pamela Susan Shoop, will you marry me?). In this one we learn an interesting fact about Michael that explains his motivation for going after Laurie and we also learn a little bit of why it is occuring on Halloween. Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis return in their respective roles, and Rick Rosenthal (who directed the newest Halloween flick, Halloween 8) takes over the directing chair for John Carpenter. Out of 5 stars, I give Halloween II 4 stars.

This second entry in the series isn't for everyone but it's well crafted and deserves a better reputation than the one it has.In a clever plot twist, the film takes place directly after the first one, with masked lunatic Michael Meyers surviving his supposedly fatal fall from a balcony and stealing a new knife from a neighbor lady. Laurie Strode is taken to the nearby hospital while Dr. Loomis resumes his search for the escaped psycho. After killing a couple pointless characters Mike finally sets his targets on Laurie and sneaks into the almost abandoned hospital, searching room-for-room for his next victim-to-be. HALLOWEEN II is a mixed bag. On one hand, director Rick Rosenthal nicely captures the atmosphere of the original and delivers some genuine shocks, but for the most part this plays more like your average FRIDAY THE 13TH clone, complete with gory murders, sleazy sex and shamefully underdeveloped characters. The best example of this is Laurie. In the original the film was basically about her and the problems that she faced, not just with Michael, but with her friends and herself. Here she is just as expendable as the other characters. Not only does she not reappear until thirty minutes into the movie, but when she finally is reintroduced, all she does is sleep and wander aimlessly through the halls! In fact, by now I could really consider Michael the main character of this movie! The first half is basically made up of him sneaking through houses and around the town before the film finally shifts gears and focuses on the victims-to-be.That said and done, once HALLOWEEN II gets going it IS kinda' scary. The film's best moments come during the scenes of subtle suspense and terror, not the ultra-gory killings. The scenes of Michael roaming through the empty corridors of the hospital, while Laurie sits hopelessly in her room waiting for the final confrontation, are very tense and if the entire movie could've had that same effect it could of been a classic. Another memorable moment is when Michael chases the helpless Laurie through the hospital in the now-familiar, but this time rather unsettling, climatic showdown.So all in all I can't really give HALLOWEEN II my basic star rating. As a slasher film all in itself it's fairly good, but as a sequel to one of the greatest horror movies ever made, well . . . This is not the best sequel but it is the scariest, and I whole-heartedly recommend this to any die-hard slasher or HALLOWEEN fanatics.

This wasn't a traditional monster or the undead.  This was just some guy that had flipped his lid and murdered his sister.  That's pretty damn unnerving, sure, but it isn't far-fetched. And though the movie ended in such a way as to leave the opening for a sequel, my impression of it was that he was still out there, stalking the streets, looking for a victim, and that made for a classic ending.  The first time you saw Halloween you couldn't leave wherever you were, or you were afraid to go to sleep.  Classic. The reason I'm making such a big stink about the first movie when I should be talking about the second is that there was an enormous difference in quality.  On its own, Halloween II might not have been such an awful flic. But after seeing Michael Myers take like twelve bullets and then be blown to hell at the end, but yet still be walking around, you no longer have a feasible situation.  Now you have a monster movie.  Now, I don't contend that movies should necessarily have to be built around the possibility that the story could occur.  But for me that was the appeal of the first Halloween.  If you sat in your car directly after seeing that movie, you had to check in your rear view for uninvited passengers in masks.  Halloween II killed off any real fear that might have lingered with you after the first movie, because you were always aware (after maybe the first sequence) that you were watching a movie.  You knew that this is Michael Myers, the Evil Character That Can't Be Killed, and that Jaime Lee Curtis was the good girl hero.  As for Donald UnPleasance, I don't blame him entirely for his role, but he over did it on the blackest eyes & pure evil thing.  His character became even more two dimensional.  Look, I love Halloween.  Love it.  But do yourself a favor and skip this crummy sequel.

Film history has already proved us that if the materials are used properly and the reconstruction is done carefully , a sequel can top the original even by miles ( examples like Superman II , Karate Kid II and of course the untoppable James Cameron's Aliens come to mind ) . Although Halloween II doesn 't actually manage to surpass its predecessor it belongs to a strange category of sequels that have their own special charms and are on a par with the original (just like Gremlins 2 ). Keep in mind that it was written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill themselves , the creators of this story . Why are you being so negative ? Can 't you realise that it is the second chapter of the whole story ?Personally I find brilliant the idea of picking up (LITERALLY) where the first movie left off . ( I cannot recall not even one sequel that did that ) It gives a very realistic touch to this hopelessly rediculous and farfetched story (don 't get me wrong , I like Halloween but it is ridiculous) . On top of that there are many reporters and TV bulletins which cover the incidents and the Hadonfield habitants now know that there is a psychopath killer loose on the streets . The realistic atmosphere gains more points . Moreover the basic set is now a hospital which is definately frightening . I have read comments saying How stupid  where are the patients ?  , well it is a local hospital what do you expect ?Probably the best scenes are the ones with Laurie ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) roaming in the dark corridors with the creepy music increasing the delusional scary atmosphere . Many viewers have said that she her character is not developped !!!! We already know her from the previous movie so know we see her struggling to survive from the clutches of the deranged Michael Myers .

His dialogue hasn 't developped much  He is pure evil blah blah blah he is not human yadda yadda yadda . Many have complained about the much gore and high body count . Well keep in mind is that Michael is more p***ed off now . What did you want ? The daytime stalking scenes of the original Halloween ? Not only it cannot be done but it would be kind of repetitive . I found quite interesting the Samhain subplot which unfolds some of the secrets of the celtic paganistic background the story is based on . The revelations continue in the next sequels .I have read all those ironic comments  Why doesn 't he speed up one step to kill Laurie ? DAAAAH !!!

This sequel to the 1978 horror/suspense classic HALLOWEEN picks up almost at the very instant where the original left off, with Donald Pleasance's character having emptied his gun into Michael Myers, only to see the maniac walk away.  Jamie Lee Curtis, who was wounded, is now being treated at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital...which is unfortunately exactly where Michael is going.  Why he is stalking Curtis exactly is what gets revealed here in this film.Director Rick Rosenthal accurately follows the pattern of John Carpenter's original film for the most part, buoyed by the return of Carpenter's own eerie score (enhanced by Alan Howarth) and the excellent cinematography of Dean Cundey, who did the original and later would do JURASSIC PARK and APOLLO 13.  On this count alone, HALLOWEEN II, like its predecessor, would normally rate a 10.But reportedly in post-production, concerned that this approach was now too old-fashioned in light of all the HALLOWEEN-inspired imitations like FRIDAY THE 13TH, Carpenter, behind Rosenthal's back, went and shot some graphically gory murder inserts--many of them, not surprisingly, involved the surgical implements inside the hospital that get used by Michael.  While many gore-hounds found these murders to be very creative, I personally thought of them as unnecessary and far too explicit.  Add to that some idiot plotting involving at least three members of the hospital staff (Leo Rossi, Pamela Susan Shoop, Gloria Gifford), and the result is something that really isn't much better than HALLOWEEN's many imitators.The film's big highlight is Curtis' being chased through the hospital by the killer, which pays perhaps an unintentional homage to the similar final sequence in Michael Crichton's 1973 sci-fi movie WESTWORLD.  Otherwise, HALLOWEEN II simply doesn't make it as a movie.  For me, this defines why it is a curiously frustrating film It could have been so much more, but instead chose to be so much less.

But unlike the original Halloween, Halloween II does not stand the test of time.Michael Myers is still the most frightening figure in horror movie history, and when he is on the screen the thrill is still there.  There are some classic moments here when he is on the prowl.But the hospital characters are obnoxious and you don't care if they end up dead.  The suspense is lacking, and in its place is gore.  Instead of building the fear, Myers uses different hospital instruments to do his unique handywork.Unfortunately, Halloween II forgot the tension and suspense that made the original so great.  Instead, it follows the same formula that the knock-offs like Friday the 13th did forget suspense, give them gore!They forgot to make this film scary.RATING 6/10 "},{"Title":"a worthy sequel","Date":"29 June 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  HALLOWEEN II is a great sequel to a classic film. Continuing on the same night on which the first film ended (thus avoiding the questions like What's Michael been doing for the three years that lapsed between films?), HALLOWEEN II finds the unstoppable Michael Myers continuing his relentless pursuit of babysitter Laurie Strode, eventually finding his way to the hospital where she has been taken for treatment of her injuries sustained in the previous film. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis and the police continue hunting the town looking for him, unaware of his whereabouts. Though not directed by John Carpenter (who was busy prepping his remake of THE THING at the time), the master of terror did return to co-write the script and co-compose the score. He also took part in some infamous reshoots that occured after director Rick Rosenthal turned in a cut Carpenter found a little too slow-going. Rosenthal is no Carpenter, but he more than lives up to the original, expertly exploiting the menace of dark hospital corridors with pools of light and shadow, and the dream sequence is also very nice. He and cinematographer Dean Cundey (JURASSIC PARK) nicely build up the film's quieter moments, and he delivers the shocks when they're called for. Though more people die this time around, some in a slightly more gruesome manner than the deaths in the previous film, HALLOWEEN II is definitely a worthy sequel.

Read if you dare!****It must be both shocking and amazing to find that despite being shot at close blank range, you can sometimes survive the ordeal.  For Mikey Myers, this is a plus since he's hell bent on murdering his older sister Laurie for no good damn reason.  Now if only he can escape the clutches of that nosy do gooder Dr. Loomis (his shrink) and find her again in Part II.....Being mentally defunct in the thinking department to separate reality from fiction, right from wrong, Coco Puffs from Krispy Wheats, etc., it is no problem for Mikey to locate his sister whom is now bedside at the local hospital.  It the town of Haddenfield, we are led to suspect that on Halloween night, the local hospital clears out it's entire working staff save a handful of lazies dumb enough to not ask for the night off and also 99% of it's patients.  This is fine by Mikey since the number of patient's room to look in and find his sis greatly decreases leaving more family time between the two.  But Laurie is not a lay down kinda gal, she feels she must wander the badly lit empty hallways of the hospital in a drugged stupor.One of the workers there that night has the hots for her. But being a clumsy oaf (and a graduate of the William Katt Stylin' Afro School), the young lass slips in one of the hallways therefore unable to save the object of his teen heart in case her nutso brother shows up...which of course he does. After some chasing, yelling, crying, dying and faces frying, good 'ole Dr. Loomis appears and tries to talk Mikey out of it.  Yeah, right. You shot me, punk! I'm still alive! Muhahahaha!, Mikey must be thinking since he never even as much grunts in the entire film, not even when set ablaze Salem style.Scenes last longer than they should in this film yet Mikey delivers the goods, scaring the viewers socks off in the stone faced mask we've both come to love and fear.

Whenever a second installment comes around, especially for a Horror film, it will give an idea of a let down. Don't pass on this film.About a year or two ago when I was in a Halloween mood, I watched the first film and then the second one that was being shown on USA. (This is the best way to see a horror movie.) I hadn't heard too much hype about Halloween 2, what with it dating back a few years. But I really love this sequel. The opening scene that picks up from the first film is well played. (It's the shot before it goes into five minutes worth of the camera slowly moving into a pumpkin.) Halloween had a very low budget, and that was one of the best things about it. But now in the second movie, there's a little more action involved. At times the film can run slow, but it's good to just let that eery music play while you're waiting to see Michael Myers come around the corner. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode, and continues to play the role very well. Now she can be considered a scream queen. Donald Pleasance...and everyone else pulls the film together in an excellent way.The best part about the film is when we finally find out why Myers is obsessed with trying to kill Strode. I won't give it away but it is pretty obvious. The writing and special effects isn't anything great but hey, look at the budget. By not including tons of effects that don't have anything to do with the main plot, it makes the film only better. One other thing that was nice was the change of the killing scenes. Not nice but you know what I mean. With every person killed, it tends to be a little different than the last one. *~spoiler*~One thing that I frowned on was how unbelievable the hospital was. Since it plays a big part, it should look somewhat real. The lack of....people, specifically patients, was a little ridiculous. The second thing that I didn't like was how Myers, is as always, indestructible. I'm mainly referring to the explosion scene towards the end.All in all, this is a sequel that can stand up to the original. If you want to keep the Halloween movies coming, skip the next six or so, and go straight to Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later. Don't ruin a good thing by trying to relive Halloween year after year.

I've become quite skeptical about them. Most are unnecessary, very rarely meet or surpass standards set and may or may not entertain. Now that doesn't mean I've written off sequels once and for all. Once in a blue moon one comes along that stands up along side or even bests the original and I actually enjoy it more. Unfortunately Halloween 2 is not one of those times.H2 is the type of sequel that lives up to the bias against sequels. Simply put, the original Halloween did so much right and H2 does so much wrong. A quick cash-in follow up that retains some of the elements we know and/or love, but throws the rest out like the baby in the bath water. Losing much of its identity along the way. Anyone who thinks this sequel can hold a candle to the original is blind to what the original did so wonderfully.The two principle cast members (in Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis) are along for the ride again, but everything is different now. John Carpenter has returned this time to only pen the script and its far from his finest hour. Rick Rosenthal at the helm can either be damned or excused if you want to wade through the semi-sordid production history behind this opus.Now I could blabber on about how the original is a classic film. How it did so much without gore or heavy violence and depended more on suspense and atmosphere. How it had logical characters we cared about and a story while simple was also kind of masterful in execution. Then I could elaborate about how brain-dead at the core H2's characters, settings and story is, but how about instead I talk about what H2 does right and saves it from the bottom of the barrel.As a fan of the series, I've always felt Donald Pleasence has been the backbone and H2 is no different. His ranting, banter with Brackett for the first half of H2, memorable quotes and just general crazy behavior is a lot of fun. The mythology of Samhain was a nice little diversion from the flat story. JLC fares well in her return, Warlock isn't a bad Shape, I liked Hunter von Leer as Deputy Hunt, the music is still great and the ending is pretty good as well.Picking up literately where the first movie left off, H2 isn't a god awful mess, a lot of people enjoy it, but it also isn't on the level already established.

Everything that was new and scary in the first Halloween is old hat three years later after movies like Friday the 13th, Graduation Day, etc. have turned all the regular shocks and horrors into cliches.  However, the movie suffers the most from the poor script.  Jamie Lee only seems to be in about thirty minutes of the movie and she spends most of it in a hospital bed reacting to medication.  The supporting characters are underdeveloped, it basically resorts to introducing a character only to have them killed off a few minutes later.  Elements of plot are introduced and then vanish and the movie is choppy in areas.  Overall, a generally bad film that is a poor follow-up to a very good movie.

As with most good sequels,we see a little of the first films ending,which it's very easy to tell a few scenes were re-shot. one thing I never understood is why they filmed the balcony scene over. In Halloween II you can see Meyers stumble off the deck again but this time,he is level with the railings,which looks to me like they set a platform up to make it easier for the stuntman to fall off(?)Some stunt man! I could be wrong but that always looked bad to me. Then after we see Micheal disappear from the ground we cut to a scene of Loomis walking outside to investigate. At this point a neighbor comes outside,Loomis tells him to call the Sheriff,he says Is this some kind of joke?I've been trick-or-treated to death tonight. To which Loomis responds with the excellent You don't know what death is. as we hear a new synthesized version of the opening theme. An excellent beginning that goes somewhat downhill from there. I really enjoy the first half of this film as we see the chaos and aftermath of a small town turned upside down on one grisly halloween night. It's nice that they explained alot of the first film more indepth and we get some true insight to our killers motives. However I think the second half of the film concentrated too much on shock and gore than the atmosphere that was so rampant in the first film. Overall I think this is the best sequel really but 4 and 6 are close. There is a directors cut that used to run on television with a few replacement scenes like the made for T.V. footage that the first film had that was shot during the filming of this one and an alternate ending,these are hard to come by now but people still have copies that circulate. I would recommend this to anyone who's seen the first but take the others at your own risk. One more note,the director Rick Rosenthal also directed Bad Boys with Sean Penn. If you watch a shooting sequence in downtown Chicago towards the beginning of the film,you can clearly see Halloween II starring Jamie Lee Curtis playing at a movie theater.

I didn't think it was NEARLY as good as the original. But of course. Most are. But this movie pretty much stinks, at least for the most part. There were a couple of suspenseful scenes, only to be ruined by really gory murders, and SO much blood splatter. There was a scene that i couldn't beleive Urban Legend stole from. The scene when some one walks in a room and slips on the blood, and hits his head. Then he's like walking around like a zombie, half-dead. Then there's a scene where Mike stabs a nurse and lifts her up in the air while Laurie Strode happens to bump in on that awful scene. There are probably 1 or 2 suspenseful scenes between Mike and Laurie, but it really doesn't help with the dumb story and dialogue.I tell you, the whole SETUP was manipulative to fans of the original. Think about it, it takes place right after the original, it looks tries to look like the original, but it doesn't really come close. Even as sequels go, this falls flat on its face! What's with the scene when Michael stalks and kills just any one at randon in the neighborhood, before heading on over to the hospital. The poor girls house had no clues as to where Laurie is at. He just killed her and that was it.And notice that Rosenthal directed this one and NOT Carpenter. Instead he went down to co-produce or writer(not sure). The story behind that is he nor Debra Hill wanted any part of this, but they practiacally were sued, so they stepped in and saved the last 20-30 minutes. This was done despite the fact that Carpenter wanted the first to be the last. He didn't like the idea that Michael Myers would be a monster.

He ends up at a hospital, which like everyone says is devoid of personnel and seems abandoned except for Curtis as a patient.  Myers is there to kill her for whatever reason, but first he must plow through a lot of staff do to that, and it's in such silly fashion.  He drains the blood of one victim, sticks a needle in the eye of another, burns the face of a hot nurse, and the dumbest death he's not even involved with, when Guest slips on blood and hits his head.  Phhhttt!  The ending's decent, but is in such slow motion that it loses points.  Myers chases Curtis like a broken robot, slowwwwwly walking behind her, unaware if he sped up he wouldn't keep narrowly missing her as much as he does.  And how odd that this featured a killing identical to one in Friday the 13th Part 2, which came out before this, when a cop is killed with the claw of a hammer to the skull.  Just something I noticed.  I didn't adore the first film like most, but I'd take it any day over this clunker, which for some reason, Carpenter decided to co-write instead of direct.

I thought it was scarier when you DIDN't know why he was chasing Laurie because it made the situation even more disturbing and frightening. But, like all horror movies, it does have some good things about it. The main theme and titles are more effective than the original's, and Dr. Loomis' character is simply awesome. But alas, not even that can save the awful hospital scenes (which are empty, devoid of staff and patients, and always dark) and fact that all of the secondary characters (except Jimmy) are so stupid that you don't care that they are slaughtered.

The very beginning plays the song Mr. Sandman, which is stupid and unsuspenseful. Then, they recycle footage from the first film, but have Michael Myers fall out the balcony window in the front yard, unlike the original when he fell out the back.Another problem was the gore. The first HALLOWEEN succeeded because Michael Myers killed people mysteriously, without gore. In this film, Myers just roams around on screen like he is another character rather than the villian and just kills people mercilessly. The gore is not disturbing, but unnecessary.Donald Pleasance looks ten years older in the first scene, then seems to gradually transform back into what he looked like in the original. Jamie Lee Curtis has about ten lines the whole film and is kept off screen for most of the movie. Charles Cyphers (as Brackett) is wasted, mostly because he appears in the film in only two scenes and disappears after the first ten minutes when he learns of his daughter's fate (from HALLOWEEN). We never hear from Cyphers again. The haddonfield hospital is pathetic, understaffed, and patient-less.But the film has its scary moments. Out of ten stars, I give this film six.

The script was uninteresting, with feebly sketched characters and boring dialogue. The direction is amazing in its ineptitude.

Sheriff Brackett vanishes halfway through. The red herring of Michael being run over by the police is obviously padding, but the biggest crime of the film (aside from the afore-mentioned score) is the shameful trade-in of the original's suspense and atmosphere for buckets of gore and some genuinely unpleasant scenes of violence.

This film answers that question.  I thought there was still a lot of scary scenes like in the original and a good score.

This movie is often put down but I can't see why.  Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't get as much time on the screen this time but why would she when Michael Myers is the main attraction in the Halloween movies.

With the exceptions of The Godfather,Part II,and Lethal Weapon 2,what sequel does? The story in Part II picks up on the same night in 1978 where the original left off...Dr.Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) still in hot pursuit of escaped mental patient Michael Myers,who continues to stalk Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis,who doesn't have much to do here except look and act catatonic) in the hospital where she is admitted after surviving Myers's earlier attack. Also back are Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers),who disappears halfway through the film after learning that his daughter Annie was one of Myers's victims,and Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens),who drops a bombshell on Dr.Loomis...Laurie is Michael's long-lost sister! You see, Michael has inherited the memory genes of his ancient Celtic ancestors,who would choose the son of one of the families in their village to murder his entire family on All Hallow's Eve to appease the Druid gods (talk about a stretch for motivation!). Most of the film takes place in a dimly lit,understaffed hospital,where Michael slashes his way through several nurses, doctors,security guards and paramedics in order to get to Laurie. Jamie Lee Curtis agreed to portray Laurie again as a favor to John Carpenter (the original's director,who serves as producer and co-writer in this effort...Rick Rosenthal is this film's director),but she originally wanted her character to be killed off in the opening sequence. There wouldn't have been a story (or the need for a sequel),since she was revealed to be Michael's target,not a random victim. The supporting players, along with the afore-mentioned Cyphers and Stephens,are excellent,especially Lance Guest as Jimmy,Pamela Susan Shoop as Karen,Tawny Moyer as Jill,and Ana-Alicia as Janet. I always wondered,did Jimmy really die? Maybe he had a concussion after slipping in Mrs.Alves's drained blood and hitting his head on the floor. I always thought that he should have been the Mr. Sandman that the opening song was promising Laurie. Since this year's H2O was the third in this trilogy (parts 3 through 6 have been totally ignored),a great story would have been for Jimmy to have survived that night 20 years ago (after all, Michael never attacked him). He and Laurie could have gotten married a couple of years later,and could have faked their deaths (in order to explain Parts 4,5 and 6),leaving their young daughter Jamie in the care of an adoptive family. Laurie could have gotten pregnant for John a year after Jamie's birth. It would have been fun to see Lance Guest portraying Laurie's estranged husband Jimmy in H2O. Also,it would have been cool to see Paul Rudd (hey,he's a major talent now,but so is Curtis, so if she can return to her horror roots,so can he) return as Tommy Doyle...and what about Lindsay Wallace and Sheriff Brackett? The H2O script would have been much scarier if it was set in Haddonfield,with Michael's survivors gathering together 20 years later for group therapy. The bottom line is, Halloween II is not a bad attempt to capture the magic that the first film possessed. It's nowhere near the original's league,but okay nevertheless. Great continuation of Carpenter's eerie score,by the way! One last thing,if Laurie shot out both of Michael's eyes in the film's finale,how could he possibly see in any of the sequels??? *** B (7 out of 10).

It works great if you watch the original then this back to back because the pacing of this film speeds up and you see more of Micheal. As it's own movie... it has some issues. Picking up right where the first film ended with Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance) shooting Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) off of a balcony then disappearing. The injured Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to recover. Michael Myers soon arrives at the hospital and begins to kill off the hospital staff before going after Laurie. While John Carpenter did write the script, he did not return to direct as he did not want to do almost the same thing again. Rick Rosenthal has fairly unknown at the time and only got the director role because John Carpenter enjoyed one of Rosenthal's short films. While this is the better of the two Rosenthal Halloween films, this is still a flawed film.The film was pressured into adding more violence to compete with other slasher films of the time, as a result murder scenes seem to be too focused on shock value then the suspense that the first film had. The one kill that has the right kind of suspense was that leading up to the security guards death, that I think is worthy of the first film. I also prefer the scalpel-in-the-back kill as it has the right tone for Micheal Myers character, displaying his great strength. He is more then a man with a knife after all. Not that the movie doesn't have suspense. It is just not the same kind as the first film has. Halloween tries to create suspense by having Michael walking down dark hallways which is effective but not as scary. It was creepier to have Micheal out of focus in the background just watching. I will say the film's chase scene is well done and creates a very tense moment as Laurie is waiting for the elevator door to close while Micheal slowly walks toward her with a scalpel. The main character from the previous film ( Laurie ) is sadly wasted in the film as she spends most of her time lying in a bed with little to no dialogue. She really only serves as something for Micheal to chase. The only real new thing that adds to her character is that she is Micheal Myers long lost sister. This one part feels so underwritten and would leave the next movies forever problematic. This little detail now robs Micheal of his mystique and negates the message of the first movie. There was no reason to Micheal's madness! The thing that made the original scary was the randomness of it all. The best character in the film is Sam Loomis. Donald Pleasance does give a great performance ( as usual ) and does a new speech about Michael Myers to a new sheriff to bring potential new viewers up to speed. However as great as Loomis is in this film, he seems only there to kill time and only makes a difference to the film at the final act. His relationship with Michael is not even explored further which is a shame as this could have made such a difference.While being at a hospital makes sense to the plot of the film it just does not seem like a real place. There are no patients shown here and the hospital is really understaffed for some reason. There are some neat uses to the hospital setting though, such as the security cameras which show us where Michael is without always relying on the P.O.V shot too much.The film features many variations of the original theme but this time played on a synthesizer instead of a piano. The theme as grown on me, but it does not have the same effect as the first film.Although this movie does have its problems I still like it more then I should. I find Dick Warlock does a great job as the shape and that he is still quite imposing. The mask still looks good and and the way he walks levels with Nick Castle's walk. Dean Cundey returns and so it is shot very well and Rosenthal creates great suspense. Halloween 2 is well-made and better then most horror movie sequels but falls short of being what is could have been.Only recommend if you enjoyed the first film.7.3 / 10 "},{"Title":"Chilling, Frightening and Overall One Of The Best In The Series","Date":"12 March 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Halloween II is one of the scariest entries in the series since the original Halloween, this sequel offers more gory scenes and a faster pace.

You might have to switch your brain off however as this is one of those film where people continually do daft things, but other than that a good time can be had by all.This one takes place several seconds after the last film, with entirely ineffectual Doctor Loomis as usual looking in the wrong places for Michael, who's out wandering the almost police free streets, stopping off long enough to kill a girl randomly while the police accidentally run over a guy who kind of looks like Myers, spending most of the film trying to find dental records. Meanwhile, Michael's headed over to the local hospital to check in on the stunned victim Laurie, and he ain't bringing some grapes and a bottle of Lucozade!As usual, we get to meet out cast of victims, most of which work in the hospital. I won't bother really telling you who is who because basically they're here to be wasted in various ways, in a more graphic manner (but still not as over the top as some slashers from this period). I think this sequel manages to do a good job of following up from the last film. Everything's cranked up a bit more (including a body count in double figures), Michael's even more indestructible than the last time, Donald Pleasance is more loony than the last time and the cinematography and soundtrack are just as good. I remember enjoying this one years ago as a teenager and still enjoy it now. Just don't go nitpicking and you'll be fine. "},{"Title":"I Shot Him, I Shot Him Six Times!!! He...He Isn't Human!!","Date":"7 November 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" I only discovered around a year and a half ago that sequels were made to the original Halloween (1978) and, whilst I made it my business to get them all (including the Rob Zombie remakes) this is, by far, the best of them!Don't ask me why, but I actually prefer this to John Carpenter's original -- not that it's better or anything like that. Carpenter remains the father of Michael Myers and what he did on such a restricted budget was amazing.But I still think that, despite the increase in violence, this film is still entertaining and, at times, quite thrilling.Even though she simply spends most of her time in the film running and cowering from Michael Myers/The Shape (reportedly whilst wearing a wig to match her hair from the first film), I love the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis reprised her role as Laurie Strode. And, despite this, her character still gets developed in a major way that should have drawn the story behind these two 'Halloween' films to a satisfactory close. The other 'Halloween' sequels just aren't the same without their original scream queen, even though she did return for the reunion twenty years after the original and Rick Rosenthal's second stab at the series!But Michael Myers is like Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger. He's an unforgettable icon of horror and a human blob for audiences to focus all their personal fears on to. As Carpenter and Loomis would say Evil never dies! Though, I frankly didn't even notice that Nick Castle didn't return to play Myers this time around.Donald Pleasence is, if anything, even more entertaining in this sequel and is always a pleasure to watch as Dr. Sam Loomis -- his most influential role since playing Blofeld in 'You Only Live Twice' (1967), so much so that his willingness to continue playing Loomis makes me wonder why he wasn't recalled to portray the cat-stroking Bond villain, at least in 'Diamonds Are Forever' (1971).Nancy Stephens makes a great return as Loomis' chain-smoking, slightly cynical nurse, Marion Chambers (whose car was attacked by Myers in the first film), whose role I find slightly poignant as the film progresses, as she sets up most of the film's plot. Charles Cyphers also returns briefly as Sheriff Brackett and even Nancy Loomis gets a brief cameo as his daughter, Annie, despite the fact that her character is dead!Lance Guest, who went on to star in the ill-fated 'Jaws The Revenge' (1987) gets quite a good role here but, other than that, most of the characters are (as in most other horror films) set up simply to be cut down. Not that that's a real problem -- this film was probably meant to do to hospitals what 'Psycho' (1960) did to showers!!Admittedly, Rob Zombie's attempt at the hospital chase had a lot more gore and tension to it and didn't drag on for half as much time, but the finale is a real blast and the addition of The Chordettes' song 'Mr. Sandman' is quite catchy, even though it doesn't make much sense in that it's a love song. Unless it's meant for Jamie Lee Curties and Lance Guest's characters... Or as a twisted symbol for Michael's arrival in Laurie's life...Anyway, this is quite a good sequel and, for those of you who enjoyed seeing P.J. Soles bearing all in the Carpenter original, Pamela Susan Shoop gets tasked with that duty this time around!I guess it's an indication of how much horror cinema in the early 1980's had changed since 'Halloween' arrived in the late 1970's, but this is just what you might expect. Bloody, violent, a fair amount of nudity -- but still tolerable and still enjoyable, not just because of all of the above!! To compete with other horror films of the time, it even has its own share of inventive death scenes over the original.As I say, the finale is great and the entire film is helped along by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth having remixed Carpenter's original score, as well as the even greater use of location work. Watch out for Rick Rosenthal's adaptation of the pumpkin from the original opening titles, this time serving an even more graphic use... "},{"Title":"Did Halloween Ever Need to Be a Series?","Date":"5 November 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Halloween II is a slasher sequel held in high regard by the fandom that I've never been crazy about. The film never impressed and always played like a pale shadow of the original. I held Friday the 13th Part II in similar regard, which I sort-of reevaluated. So why not Michael Myers second outing? There's a certain verisimilitude to the premise that's admirable. Halloween II picks up right where the first ended, on Halloween night, 1978. The film occasionally dips its toes into realism. Laurie's traumatized state is treated logically. Haddonfield's reaction to the murders is interesting. News of the killings line every TV, photographers buzzing around the survivors. The town folks gathering around the old Myers house to stone it is interesting as well.Any attempts at realism are sacrificed for clichés. Halloween II came out during the slasher boom that followed the original. If any film could have resisted the conventions of the genre, it would have been the sequel to the one that started it all. Instead, Halloween II' gleefully conforms. The hospital is surprisingly empty, like a summer camp that I could name. Cars won't start when needed. At least there's a reason for that, though when Michael had time to slash every tire in the lot, I don't know. Maybe he did at the same time he cut the phone lines? The spring-loaded cat and fake-out scares are presented and accounted for. Myers embodies the slow moving killer, allowing his would-be victim plenty of time to escape. After Michael is seemingly knocked dead, some idiot leans over the body, allowing the killer to spring back up and kill him. By far the biggest cliché Halloween II practices is a larger cast, filled with indistinct victims that serve no purpose other then to up the body count. Is the Shape stabbing a truly random teenager to death or murdering folks with the claw-end of a hammer out of character? Maybe, maybe not. But it sure doesn't feel natural.The most unnatural move is Laurie Strode being revealed as Myers' long lost sister. Carpenter has admitted to pulling that story turn out of his butt. Like making Regan McNeil as magical healer in Exorcist II, it robs the first film of its frightening randomness. Michael Myers is no longer a roving, destructive force of nature. Now he has an agenda. Worse yet, it's a totally unneeded development. The killer continuing to stalk his surviving victim wasn't motivation enough? There are many things I dislike about Halloween The Franchise, but that reoccurring plot line is the thing I most hate.Rick Rosenthal is no John Carpenter. He employs Carpenter's tracking shots a few time but always in service of a POV. Rosenthal does away with John's color palette. The night is black, with none of those cool blues. His scene presentation is flat. Rosenthal's talent instead lies in striking near-still photography. His best moments are when the camera stops to focus on an eerie, empty frame. A hospital door slowly blowing open, a knife in a desk, a body lying in a pool of blood. No, Rosenthal isn't Carpenter but he does show some talent.The first film didn't leave much room for returning cast members. Jamie Lee Curtis probably couldn't say no to her biggest hit's sequel. Yet her disinterest in returning is evident. Laurie spends the majority of Halloween II lying in bed, drowsy from medication. She still has that spirit to survive but there's little life behind Curtis' eyes. This is truly Donald Pleasence's show. Loomis is far more unhinged this time, shouting and screaming, pulling guns on people, and running around like a madman. It's the first suggestion of the doctor being as dangerous as his patient. Donald even gets another monologue that nearly rivals the Blackest Eyes speech, a backseat discussion about Celtic rituals and humanity's inner darkness. Is it any wonder the Pleasence's increasingly sloppy drunk performance would become the best thing about the further sequels? The new additions don't make as much of an impression. Lance Guest is flat as the guy who develops romantic feelings for Laurie for no particular reason. Leo Rossi plays the traditional slasher movie jerk, a vulgar, abrasive ambulance driver named Budd. Pamela Susan Shoop is incredibly beautiful as his girlfriend, Karen. Some review I read years ago described her as having perfect breasts and I can't say I disagree. As for the rest of the new cast? Empty, every single one of them, generic slasher fodder. The drunk doctor, the tough black nurse, the other nurse, the other other nurse, that's as much character development as you get.As Halloween II goes on, it starts to win me over. The movie toys seriously with killing Laurie off, which makes her constant peril more involving. Myers slowly appearing behind a victim and sticking her with a needle, though blatantly derivative of the first film, works well. A car horn or a door that won't open raise the stakes nicely, our heroine coming close to being caught. Michael Myers isn't Jason or Freddy so I've never liked his creative kills but, I have to admit, lifting a victim up with a blade? That's cool. There's a loud musical sting whenever the killer jumps out. Yeah, Laurie shows amazing accuracy for someone who's probably never handled a gun before. As much as it pains me to say it, Halloween II delivers on the scares, belabored and engineered though they might be.Halloween II is probably as good as a sequel that starts with a continuity error can be. It's unnecessary and I take issue with many of its stylistic and story decision. But compared to what came after? Yeah, I'll take it. Should Halloween have ever been a series? No, probably not. But I'll take it anyway.

He soon arrives at the hospital where Laurie is staying, and begins butchering anyone who crosses his path while searching for his target. Dr. Loomis, who finds out that Laurie is actually Michael's long lost sister, quickly realizes that Michael must be trying to finish what he started several years ago when he killed his older sister Judith. Dr. Loomis quickly travels to the hospital, which is now the site of a grisly massacre. He plans on ending Michael's reign of terror once and for all! But how can you stop someone who seems to be indestructible? This sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece Halloween has more action, more gore, and even a couple of explosions. That doesn't quite make it better than its predecessor, though it comes close to being almost just as good. I always loved this movie and found it to be a great and immensely entertaining followup to one of the best horror films of all time. Michael Myers, played excellently by Dick Warlock, isn't nearly as mysterious or scary as he was in the previous film, but here is way more violent and brutal. It seems he is tired of wasting time and will stop at nothing to find and kill Laurie, played by Jamie Lee Curtis who gives a great performance just like before. Donald Pleasence excels once again as the now obsessive Dr. Loomis, who seems to be losing his mind and, by the end of the film, may have grown just as insane as Michael. I love the claustrophobic setting of this movie, as the darkly lit halls of the hospital make for some truly creepy atmosphere. Add to all that an epic and explosive finale, and you have Halloween II. If you're a fan of the original, check this amusing sequel out right away. You won't be disappointed!

The setting first of all is a great one for a slasher flick. The hospital is dark and creepy and filled with doctors and nurses who were clearly thrown in to add to the body count. The musical score is just as effective, and Michael Myers is just as deranged as he was in the first film. The acting all around was pretty good, particularly from the nurses. Pamela Susan Shoop, Tawny Moyer, Ana Alicia and Gloria Gifford do a very good job as the unaware hospital staff. There is a great atmospheric feeling to 'Halloween II', you never know where Michael is going to pop out of in the dark corridors of the hospital. We also get some backstory to Michael and Laurie, of course being that they are brother and sister. It really ties everything together quite nicely and explains some questions people might have from the first one, like perhaps why was Michael after this girl? The one downside to 'Halloween II' was the lack of character development. It was done well in the original film, but not in this sequel. We meet the supporting characters, but they are clearly there just to be killed off.Jamie Lee Curtis does well as Laurie, but her character is given a back- seat in this one.

After the success of the original film, a sequel to Halloween was a virtual certainty. Three years later, the blood-thirsty masses were finally treated to what they'd been clamoring for&#x96;the return of Michael Myers.Halloween II isn't your typical follow-up, though. It takes place only minutes after the first movie has concluded, with Laurie Strode (Curtis) being carted off to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to receive treatment for her wounds. Michael, of course, has vanished, and Dr. Loomis continues his mad dash around town in a vain attempt to put down the deranged mass murderer once and for all.Most of the action takes place in the hospital where Laurie is being kept, and the layout of the place makes it, in essence, a labyrinth of darkened hallways that disorient viewers. This, of course, is the point, because it's entirely possible that Michael will pop out from anywhere at any second, ratcheting up the tension to admirable heights.There are a few other quirks about Halloween II that stand out as particularly unusual, especially the lead characters' constant puzzlement over the fact that Michael was shot six times at point blank range and lived to tell the tale. In most modern horror movies, it's a foregone conclusion that the baddie is an indestructible monster who can be hindered but never truly eliminated. Since this is one of the first films to transform what would otherwise be an entirely human villain into a Terminator-esque menace to society, I suppose the filmmakers thought it prudent to mention this more than once&#x97;as if doing so would cause the audience to say, Yeah, that's true&#x96;how the heck is he still alive!? In a way, this strategy does have its intended effect, but viewers are ever given a satisfying explanation as to why Michael can be stabbed, shot, burned and (essentially) be no worse for the wear. There are a few tidbits thrown into the story regarding Druids, pagan rituals and the like, but, again, this does little to sate the curiosity regarding Michael's seemingly invincible persona.Aside from a handful of quibbles that are admittedly minor, Halloween II is a solid stand alone horror film. I got the feeling that director Rick Rosenthal was doing everything he could to mimic Carpenter's style, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. In fact, the same iconic first-person perspective shots, cheap scares, slow burns are all present, and, much to my surprise, almost all of these strategies work just as well as they did the first time around.It's rare that a sequel succeeds in bottling some of the magic that made its forerunner a hit, but Halloween II manages the task (and handily, I might add).Oh, before I forget, here are some memorably creepy scenes to keep an eye out for Michael walking through a plate glass door without missing a step; the bled nurse and the pool of blood; and, of course, the finale, which sees Laurie shoot Michael in both eyes just before blowing him up.Well played, Mr. Myers. Well played indeed.

As such, when I earnestly resolved to sit through 'Halloween 2' (having seen only disappointing snippets of various entries in the franchise which had melded in my mind into a homogenous blob) I felt sure I would be testing my boredom threshold. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the movie which, while obviously not as good as the original, stands up to it admirably.The first item of note is the interesting premise that, as the first film explicitly left room for a sequel, 'Halloween 2' literally wastes no time and picks up immediately where the last one left off and concentrates on the continuing efforts of Loomis (Pleasance) and the police to capture Michael Myers on the same evening. Furthermore, the main locale shifts to the local hospital where Laurie Strode (a dialogue-less Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken and where Myers ventures in a desire to finish the job. In addition to the main actors reprising their role, the fact that the screenplay was written by Carpenter and the fact that Rick Rosenthal's direction mimics Carpenter's effectively makes the film feel like a seamless continuation from the original. However the film distinguishes itself from the original through the locale shift to the deserted corridors of the hospital and the visceral quality to the kills (for example the bath scene) which brought to my mind the stylised deaths in Italian giallo films a la Dario Argento.The later films in the franchise (excluding the failed experiment of the under-rated Halloween 3 Season of the Witch) would resurrect Myers ad nauseum and ultimately the franchise went to the point of unintentional parody and robbed the slasher genre of everything that made it great. However, if watched alongside the original, 'Halloween 2' offers a convincing continuation of the nightmare.

This film was perfectly able to illustrate that it was much darker and in this movie, you can immediately start to feel sorry for Laurie as you understand she's in danger.***SPOILERS***I particularly liked the opening scene before just before the title appeared. I liked how it showed the flashback and how it showed Michael had disappeared. When Dr Loomis says the line You don't know what death is and then the music just builds up! That was the moment when I knew this film would be something remarkable! The scene where Loomis goes inside the hospital as Laurie pleads for help was great. When she started running and screaming to open the door, that scene really felt intense as Michael just slowly walks up. From that point on, the rest of the film was just intense and beautifully done, making Halloween II as good, if not better, than the original film!

He goes after his other sister named Laurie Strode, a bookworm who tries to babysit two kids while learning that that the bogeyman is out there to get here. It became a big hit and spawned this second entry of the saga three years later named Halloween II.When I first saw this after having been enthralled by the original, I wasn't expecting this to be as excellent, but at least have the spirit and tone of the original. Sure, it lacks the suspense of the first and Michael Myers was shown a bit too much, not to mention the poorly lit hospital which was pretty scary, yet very confusing at the same time, but that doesn't matter for they seem to be outweighed by it's redeeming factors.The acting is great thanks to an ensemble cast, the direction from Rick Rosenthal is decent, the pacing is well-paced, the death scenes, much like the original, are unforgettable and the music from Alan Horvath is at the same depth as the original's music for being quite atmospheric which fits the tone of the movie perfectly.I can understand why lots of people, including Halloween fans, hated this sequel especially the critics, but I thought this is a decent sequel to a great classic. It may be flawed, but it might be worth-watching if you give it a chance.

But worst of all (and I realize I'm not speaking for everyone) I just think the whole explanation behind Michael's rampage, and the brother/sister link, ruin it. I'm of the school of thought that Michael Myers was much scarier when he was just a psycho in a mask getting his sick jollies. He wasn't targeting any specific protagonist to satisfy silly, obligatory plot-threads in the script. For me, this brother/sister plot-thread is better left forgotten - which means you'd have to forgo ALL the rest of 'em. Which I'm content to do.

Michael Myers (now played by stuntman Dick Warlock) on the loose in Haddonfield, tailing his quarry Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to the hospital where she's been taken and slaughtering everybody in his way. Fortunately, intrepid Dr. Loomis (the great Donald Pleasence) is still around to doggedly pursue the stealthy Myers.John Carpenter and Debra Hill return to write and produce Halloween II, while Carpenter mostly turns over the directorial reins to then newcomer Rick Rosenthal, who does a more than capable job of maintaining the style of the original. A number of the technical crew return from the original (including ever reliable cinematographer Dean Cundey and camera operator Ray Stella). We do see more of Myers than ever before, but there are still great sequences where we see things from his perspective.One can hardly fail to notice that Halloween II is more in the mold of the slashers of the time than Halloween what with some of the choices it makes, namely substantially increasing the body count and having Myers change up his methods of murder a fair bit, and raising the level of gore. Some scenes are ingeniously staged, when things happen in the background of which characters in the foreground are unaware; the aspect of using security camera perspectives is another fine touch. Carpenter does a typically fun job with the music, bringing back the old themes and adding new stuff with the assistance of Alan Howarth (their first collaboration).The cast does praiseworthy work, even if Jamie Lee doesn't play too big a part until the climactic chase; Pleasence once again lends true gravitas to the story. Charles Cyphers briefly reprises his role of Sheriff Brackett, Lance Guest is lovelorn paramedic Jimmy, Gloria Gifford, Pamela Susan Shoop, Tawny Moyer, and Ana Alicia are a very attractive group of nurses (Shoop also gives us a delectable breast shot), Hunter von Leer is solid as the deputy who takes over in Brackett's absence, Nancy Stephens returns to the role of nurse Marion Chambers, and Leo Rossi adds some humour as the lewd and crude Budd. (Pay close attention and you'll also see Warlock in a secondary role as a cop and Dana Carvey, in his film debut, as an assistant to a TV producer.)It's up to the individual viewer how much or how little they appreciate the new twists Carpenter brings to the tale, or the fact that more explanation is given as to why Myers does the things that he does.In any event, Halloween II is good entertainment, exceptionally well paced, suspenseful, violent, and genuinely exciting by the end. It's a worthy sequel to a classic original.Eight out of 10.

Laurie Strode is taken to the hospital for treatment of her injuries while Dr. Loomis is still ranting and raving about how inhuman Myers is. While overhearing a radio broadcast, Michael finds out where Laurie is and he enters the hospital killing the entire staff before chasing Laurie, again. This film lacks all of the suspense of the original and replaces it with needles in eyeballs and temples, scalding hot tub death, a strangulation, a hammer in the head, blood drained from a catheter and a scalpel in the back to name a few. This is one of the better sequels to Halloween, continuity is the key and this one pulls it off nicely. The original cast has returned as well as some new faces and the storyline is continued nicely.

This movie is an absolute gem of a sequel, and in my opinion is as good as the first installment. The theme music has been revamped, with creepy results. The atmosphere is electric, with some lovely shots of Michael suddenly appearing in the rear view mirror of a car, or under a light with an accompanying musical sting. This movie moves at a quicker pace than It's predecessor, and has a quirky array of characters. Special mention must go to Bud the paramedic and his girlfriend, nurse Karen,and that wonderful hot tub scene. I actually found this even scarier than the first installment, as this portrays Michael as more supernatural and mysterious, who seems indestructible. The hospital was a great setting, with all it's dark corridors and stair wells. Donald Pleasance is once again great as Dr Loomis and plays it with total conviction.

After the first film, which was shot on a very low budget, surpassed everyone's expectations by becoming the highest grossing independent film in history, major studios were making a series of imitators, one of them being Sean Cuningham's Friday The 13th (1980), which was released by Paramount and a blood stained or more commercial answer to Halloween. It's ironic that the same studios who turned John Carpenter's horror thriller down were making their own films about serial killers stalking teenagers, most of them being uninspired compared to the original Halloween. There are a few exceptions though, like Wes Craven's superb A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984).Anyway, back to this movie. Universal Studios began approaching John Carpenter and Debra Hill with the idea of a sequel, for which they declined at first. Even Debra Hill said herself in a 2002 interview that a sequel was The furthest thing from our minds. After Moustapha Akkad (finacer of the first film) agreed to make a follow up, Carpenter and Hill said that they would produce it and write the screenplay but only if the film were be to directed by someone else. Carpenter originally handed the opportunity to direct Halloween 2 over to Tommy Lee Wallace, who was the production designer and editor of the first film. Wallace didn't care for the script that Carpenter and Hill wrote and stated that he wasn't attached to the story so he dropped out of the project. The responsibility of directing would eventually go to an unknown director named Rick Rosenthal who had made a short film that Carpenter was impressed with which is the reason why Rosenthal got the job.Carpenter and Hill decided to make this movie a continuation of the first film, it picks up exactly where the first one left off and takes place completely on the same night as the fist film. After it is revealed at the end of the first film that Michael Myers is not dead, police are out around town looking for him, along with Dr. Loomis who knows for sure that Myers is still alive. Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to the hospital after surviving from Michael's bloody rampage. She appears to be safe but Myers soon finds out about where she is and makes his way to the clinic and of course, all hell breaks lose. It appears that the nightmare isn't over yet and audiences will have to find out if Laurie (or anyone for that matter) will survive the rest of the night.Production began in early 1981, Jamie Lee Curtis returned to play the role that made her famous from the first film, Laurie Strode. Dean Cundey, who was the cinematographer on the first Halloween, returned also to bring his unique visual approach. This time, to play Michael Myers, the filmmakers brought in a stunt man named Dick Warlock who had worked on many movies as a stunt man for many years. The always loyal Donald Plescence also returned from the first film to play Dr. Loomis, his performance feels just as focused as it was the first time around. Besides Jamie Lee and Donald, an entire new cast was added to play the residents at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, which most of the film takes place at. There was a lot of tension on the set, Carpenter and director Rick Rosenthal had a different vision on what the finished film should be and and producer Debra Hill said that the movie was very difficult to be fully realized. When the film was finished, Carpenter was not happy with it and even said that Rosenthal should completely change his movie, stating that it wasn't frighting enough. Carpenter has said in an interview that he shot the opening scenes in the movie and that he was not happy doing it but that it had to be done to make the movie better. This is the film that you see today.Released on October 30th of 1981, Halloween 2 was a box office hit and while Carpenter and Hill were not pleased with the film, audiences enjoyed it. Rick Rosenthal, while his experience with Carpenter may have not been pleasant, has said that he thinks the movie holds up very well and is still really scary. Rosenthal would return to direct another Halloween sequel 20 years later, the 2002 film Halloween Resurrection. As for my views on the film, I feel that this movie is just as great as the first film and just as scary and entertaining. This film was much darker in terms of style and of course, there is more gore this time around. While the first film has no scenes of graphic violence, we can all assume that John Carpenter was feeling (as Tommy Lee Wallace stated) the pressures of the market place. Films like Friday The 13th had much more blood and violence in them so Carpenter wrote Halloween 2 including more of that. I still feel that this movie is just as suspenseful and while not as pure as the first film, still a good movie, I would say that it's great even. The atmosphere is well done and includes really nice camera work from Dean Cundey. If you're a horror fan then this movie should please you.

Halloween is the quintessential slasher movie - and probably still the best of the bunch by far. In some ways Halloween II struggled at times to live up to the standards set by its predecessor, but in the end still managed to do a pretty good job while still giving the industry an example to follow which the industry - unfortunately - chose largely not to follow.The events in this sequel all take place on one night - Halloween night 1978. It picks up right where Halloween left off, just as Dr. Loomis (again a brilliantly believable performance by Donald Pleasance) fires six bullets into Michael Myers after his attack on Laurie (again played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Here we see the beginning of a tradition in this kind of movie Michael Myers becomes the evil that won't die. After taking six bullets he gets up and walks away, to wreak havoc and terror on Haddonfield, Illinois for the rest of the night, all the while searching for Laurie. There's a lot more violence in this one than in the original, which depended more on atmosphere and suspense, with the violence in that one being largely contained in the last half hour or so of the movie. The violence is also more graphic than in the original, although pretty tame compared to later examples of the slasher genre. Suspense isn't lacking. There's good use of the concept of The Shape as Michael Myers is referred to in the credits; eerie semi-glances at him as he stalks his next victim. Pleasance, as noted, was great. Jamie Lee Curtis was I thought underused - although Laurie was the focus of Michael's rage. Through most of the film she simply lay in a hospital bed recovering from the wounds she suffered at the end of the first movie. Most of her acting took place late in the movie, her performance being (I thought) somewhat stronger than in the first, where she came across to me at times as surprisingly wooden and unemotional. She had obviously matured as an actress in the intervening three years, and it was unfortunate that her performance wasn't more central to the story.Two plot points were problematic to me - one minor and one significant. The minor point first. Obviously to create suspense, a decision was made to make sure that none of the characters ever turned on the lights in a dark room when they entered it. Over and over characters seemed to enter dark spaces that looked as if they should have had a light switch somewhere nearby (like the nurse who entered the office of the doctor she was looking for) but never bothered to turn it on. Odd the things you notice, but that bugged me. The major plot problem for me though was the use of an anachronism. In the first movie there was really no sense that Laurie was the centre of Michael Myers' attention. He seemed just out to kill and if she hadn't gone over to the house where the killing was happening there was nothing in the movie that suggested Michael would have searched her out. Then, here, lying on the bed in the hospital, Laurie whispers in bewilderment why me? as if she saw herself as the main object in Myers' game of murder. I realize that for the sequel that was the case, but it seemed to me to be inconsistent with the first and I couldn't see any reason in particular that Laurie would have seen herself as anything more than another of Michael Myers' victims.Still, this was good and suspenseful and a whole lot better than most of the sequels that followed (not only the subsequent Halloween sequels, but sequels and even originals of the other slasher series that followed it.)

That is just mind blowing because Halloween 8 as we all know is atrocious. Its such a quiet, moody film that even if it didn't use more killings and blood (which it uses a lot more of compared to the first film) this would still be considered a horror movie simply because of the way it looks sounds and is. Donald Pleasance is fantastic and the ending is a perfect way to wrap the series up. John Carpenter wrote this film with Debra Hill and intended that this be the death and demise of the kill Michael Myers. The bleeding eyes is perfect. Plus the suspense of the body coming back in the flames and then dropping and that Mr. Sandman song coming on completes the film to a T. It just makes me think of Halloween time so much!

It continues to play with the terror of voyeurism. Often you spot Michael watching his prey and often you are placed in the shoes of the killer. The only difference between the two films is that in Halloween 2, you are forced more to look through the eyes of the killer while only a few time will you see Michael in the background while vice versa for the original.

We witness fires, strangulations, hammer blows, gunshots and even boiling water being used as weapons. But even so, the images are often more imagined than real.

However Halloween II, made 3 years after John Carpenter's original, does just that and overall comes out to be a successful exercise in terror. The film continues from the moment Halloween left off. Not to spoil the plot, Laurie is taken to the local hospital where she is again pursued by Michael Myers. It is this continuation of the story, as well as Rosenthal's attempts to recreate Carpenter's visual style (still lots of long POV tracking shots) which differentiates Halloween II from the other sequels in the series; it actually serves to further the plot in an interesting way and remains consistent with the first film's style and content. A very worthy film when taken on its own, it also serves as the concluding episode to the first part in the Halloween franchise.Rosenthal uses the hospital setting to great advantage. With only a skeleton crew working, the hospital is dark, empty, and has an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia. In several scenes, Rosenthal uses the darkness of the hospital to mask Michael's presence in a room only to have him appear as the light shifts, which is a truly chilling effect. Much more chilling than anything in the later sequels.Critics generally bashed the film because of the blood and gore. I find this completely ludicrous, because whatever blood and gore it did have hardly affected anything. There actually isn't even that much when compared to the later sequels.All and all Halloween II is a great follow up to the classic original. It's the best sequel out of the series, one of the best horror sequels ever made, and a more than acceptable stand-alone film.

The main purpose in the first one was to use a claustrophobic atmosphere to create a terrifying monster. In the second film, they are using that terrifying monster to kill a bunch of people in creative ways, and given the goal, Halloween II is a smashing success.We take up right where the first film left off with Micheal surviving the gun shot from Loomis and getting up to terrorise the Haddonfeild neighbourhood. Quickly dispatching a rather silly young woman before she can finish her brownies! Micheal continues his quest to find his sister Laurie Strode, who has been taken to a local hospital.Going to a local hospital gives Micheal the opportunity to boil a girl to death in a bath tub, slice up a security guard, bleed a girl dry and eventually blow himself up after getting his eyes shot out.Dr Loomis is a more fun character in this movie, acting with a lot more confidence rather than the tortured old man he is in later sequels, or the dead serious character he played in the first film. After adding some depth to the Laurie Strode character in the first one and creating a character who was more than a typical damsel in distress, in this one they decide to undo all of that good work and make Laurie Strode exactly like a typical damsel in distress.This film lacks the atmosphere of the original, but keeps the same effective score. It's a nice little movie, containing some nudity and lots of blood in a couple of scenes, but no real extreme violence. An enjoyable return trip to Haddonfeild.

We follow Laurie Strode to the town hospital where she is treated for injuries sustained during Michael's attack and in a drug-induced haze, starts remembering disturbing parts of her childhood that were blocked out long ago. Naturally, Michael finds her there, and with the town police force slow to pick up on his plans, a dangerous game of cat and mouse ensues.For the most part, Halloween II is typical slasher fare. Although Halloween creators John Carpenter and Debra Hill still had a hand in it, the sequel is hardly in the same class as it's predecessor nor does it have half the suspense. Regardless, as far as sequels go, this one is still worth a go-round. Instead of just giving us more bloodshed for the sake of more bloodshed (and don't worry, there's more bloodshed), a back-story is created for both Michael Myers and his helpless victim, Laurie Strode. The film's director, Rick Rosenthal, does his best to match the tension and the grisliness of the first film, but sometimes it falls flat. There is one scene in particular where we follow a security guard into the basement of the hospital that goes on forever. I'm not exaggerating when I say time stops for this scene, and that's a perfect example of this film's main flaw. Rosenthal isn't Carpenter and it is obvious. Halloween II wants to be the companion piece to the original so bad that it tries to match it, but can't. To be honest, the movie is at it's best when it acts as a slasher sequel and works on the story being told. While being a bit convoluted, the revelation that is made in this film regarding Michael's connection to Laurie is an interesting one and sets the stage for a rather dramatic third act. There are other positives to this film as well. Take the main setting of the film, the hospital. Most of the film takes place there and it is utilized rather well, making way for some truly unsettling moments, such as Michael passing through a room full of newborn children. The make-up/effects are quite a prominent feature of this film, and although not the main focus, are just as good as anything else from it's time. Most of the actors who survived Halloween show up in the sequel, but it is Jamie Lee Curtis and the iconic Donald Pleasence who steal the show. Curtis, despite playing a character out of commission for the bulk of the film, conveys the sheer terror and confusion necessary for the situation. Pleasence is great as he always is, as Michael's doctor turned arch-nemesis. He would return for three more sequels and this was just the beginning of his mad doctor routine. If you can accept that the more, more attitude of horror sequels is in full effect here and that, other than in story, it bears little to no resemblance to the original's feel and tone, then all is fine. Despite some flaws, Halloween II is still a worthy sequel. At the very least, it keeps the story interesting, all while updating the style and effects for the 80's. Afterall, how good could a sequel to such an influential film be? This film falls in line with other #2's such as Jaws 2 and Psycho II in that it is good, but has got nothing on it's source material.

Halloween was an indie film that terrorized a nation in 1978. As this started the slasher craze and spawned rip-offs like Friday the 13th, Universal stepped in to help. We pick up right after the end of the original Halloween when Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) finds his patient, Michael Myers, missing. Lauire (Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to the hospital, and Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) discovers the three bodies in the house across the street, and one of them is his daughter. Let's start with my gripes on this movie. First, while John Carpenter and Debra Hill work on the new screenplay, the director reins go to Rick Rosenthal. I do not want to say Rosenthal was bad, but for many of the scenes, he just copied Carpenter's style. Second, Laurie did not have much to do in this film. In the first one, she works against Michael Myers, but now is doped up on pain killers and becomes too passive. Finally, the Michael Myers personality goes awry. In the first place, the Shape is now played by Dick Warlock. One might think anyone can play him with that blank mask. Not so. The moves are more robotic instead of pathologic patience. This might come from Rosenthal who also has Michael kill one person he really did not need to kill. In the first one, he only kills to set-up a trap. Moreover, to display his strength, in one scene he lifts a nurse off the floor with a scalpel. I'm sorry, that scene was moronic. Even more problematic is a scene when Michael simply walks through a glass door. Sorry, I cannot buy that one. However, there are some good things for Halloween II. The first is Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis. He plays the part with such passion, persistence, and persuasion. He tries to buck the system, makes passionate pleas that make no sense--all for the cause of stopping evil incarnate. Also, Michael Myers has a personality in there somewhere. It almost surfaces when Laurie calls out to him. He listens to Dr. Loomis when the dedicated Psychiatrist warns him of a coming demise. Finally, Rosenthal does make some good scenes. In one, Michael appears out of the shadow to murder a nurse. In another, he gives us the suspense of another nurse mistaking Michael for her boyfriend. One of the most terrifying is another nurse discovering all the tires in the parking lot. The audience will get a true sense of despair in that one. So overall, Halloween II is worthwhile. I wished they would have stopped there.

Laurie is rushed to hospital after her ordeal with the psychopath Michael Myers, where she learns hereafter from an EMS driver Jimmy Lloyd that the man who attacked her was Michael Myers infamous for murdering her his older sister fifteen years beforehand. After this Laurie begins drifting in and out of consciousness having strange flashbacks about her adoption by the strodes and visiting an unpleasant boy in an institution. Meanwhile Dr. Loomis and Sheriff Brackett continue to search for Myers, however Brackett soon leaves for his wife after learning of his daughter's death at Myers' hands. Loomis teams up with a deputy to continue there search, meanwhile Myers has learned of Laurie's location at the Haddonfield Hospital and goes for her murdering the hospital's staff one by one. He pursues Laurie whom is eventually saved by Loomis who arrives at her side, in a final confrontation Laurie escapes while Loomis and Myers seemingly die in an explosion.The beginning of this film is very good with Michael wandering through town with the police of his tail, very reminiscent somewhat of Bride of Frankenstein however once we reach the hospital it becomes a little dull. The acting in this film is sub par, with another brilliant performance by Donald Pleasance however Jamie Lee Curtis has hardly anything to do throughout the middle of this film. The film has some great memorable scenes such as the Michael look a like scene in which a drunken teenager dressed up like myers is hit by a car in an explosion. There are quite a few good death scenes including a young orderly woman whom is dunked in boiling hot water until her skin peels of her, the film is much more gory this time round but not to over the top. The film manages to keep a level of suspense but drags in parts and this is because the hospital is just not a good setting for an entire film, the beginning and end are the only strong points in the film and with a few good scenes here and there in the middle which just manages to give us a solid slasher.Definitely worth checking out if your a fan of the first film, otherwise avoid because you will be most likely disappointed.

By straight slasher I mean that if has lots of gore, many killings, and more on screen time for Michael Myers. While the original has a more suspenseful and mysterious tone, this sequel goes straight to the point with all the killings and chasing sequences but with a dark tone and a creepy atmosphere. I really dug the opening sequence were Myers sneaks in some homes and finds a butcher's knife, the prowls until he murders an innocent girl. The POV shots are always great.Also, this sequel is dark and has some scary scenes and the occasional jump out of your seat tricks. But overall, Halloween II is more than just a slasher sequel. It's a solid Horror movie with a creepy setting, a decent plot, and good score. Also, it is a heavily underrated movie that should be considered among the best sequels to a good Horror movie ever made.Donald Pleasence is great as always in the role that gained for him thousands of fans.

Of the sequels I can stomach the unrelated Halloween III Season of the Witch(so silly that it's good!), Halloween 4 and Halloween H20, and you can keep the rest.Unbelievable as it may seem, HII was the first Halloween film that I ever saw as a teenager in the mid-'80s. (My parents were a little anal about letting me watch nasty movies in my younger years, so I never saw the original during its first run in theatres, on cable, or even on network TV. I think their censorship policy is what eventually turned me into a lifelong horror fanatic who overdosed on EVERYTHING gory once I was old enough to buy my first VCR, but that's a whole 'nother story for another time...) Anyway, when I first saw Halloween II circa 1986 or '87 it was in the form of the infamous TV cut version that was shown on many independent TV stations at the time. One of the worst examples of TV editing in movie history, this version turned Halloween II into a bloodless, incomprehensible, poorly dubbed piece of crap, but something about it fascinated me. Perhaps it was Carpenter's famed theme music, or that scary raspy breathing noise from Myers, or Dr. Loomis' crazed intensity, but I must have watched that version a dozen times before a friend took pity on me and loaned me his VHS copy of the real thing so I could see what the film makers originally intended. For a teenager who hadn't been exposed to much in the way of filmed horror, the unedited Halloween II was pretty strong stuff, but I loved it and made it my life's mission to catch up on all the other horror/slasher movies that I'd been missing out on. I still watch the original and/or Halloween II (the REAL thing mind you, not the TV version) at every October and to this day, Michael Myers has not been topped as the screen's number one boogeyman (Jason who?). October is coming up again as I type this and I'm sure that Michael Myers will come stalking through my living room at least once... and that haunting theme music will still send a chill up my spine every time.

We get the last few minutes of the original, with Dr Loomis firing 6 slugs into Michael Myers, who proceeds to plunge from the balcony of the home where Laurie Strode was babysitting. One moment, Michael is there; the next - gone!!! It is at this point that the audience gets what the movie's tag promises - More of the Night HE Came Home! Michael is up and about, bullet-riddled and driven to finish off the one that got away - Laurie Strode!

There is a method to Michael's madness, but I won't tell - you have to see the film for yourself.HALLOWEEN II, while filmed 3 years later than its predecessor, has most of the same production team that worked on the original. While it lacks some of the suspense and tension of the first film, it more or less makes up for that with a fair amount of gore. While terror and suspense were OK in 1978, it was now the 1980s.

Maybe I've become blunted to quiet serial killers from watching countless slasher movies. Compared to Jason or Freddy, Michael Myers has always seemed a bit slow and unimaginative for my taste and the much praised first part is no exception to that. However, I'm not trying to put down those movies, I just want to make clear that it's no sacrilege for me to compare this second part to the holy grail that is the original for a lot of fans.The story picks up right where Halloween ended. Laurie has survived the first part of the night and is taken to the hospital. As we know, Michael Myers has not been killed by Doctor Loomis and is still on the loose. He continues his killing spree and follows Laurie to the hospital to finish what he has begun a few hours earlier. Along the way we learn a few things about Michael's and Laurie's past.In many aspects Halloween II is even superior to its predecessor. There are a lot more kills and some of them are even a bit creative (burning/drowning a girl in a tub, jab to the eye) whereas the first movie (and most that would follow) often doesn't go beyond Michael Myers stabbing someone or slitting throats. Apparently, John Carpenter himself went back and added some explicit violence as he thought the finished version by Rick Rosenthal was too tame. Bless his soul! I think what a lot of people like best about Halloween compared to other slasher flicks, though, is that it relies more on suspense than gore. And Halloween II does indeed give you a lot of suspense. Although it doesn't seem like that when you read the story on paper, the hospital actually makes for a pretty good horror movie setting with its dark corridors and observation cameras.Plotwise the story develops a bit without moving as ridiculously far away from the original premise as some of the sequels did. That's not saying Halloween II doesn't have its share of ridiculousness. Dr. Loomis makes for a few unintentionally funny moments when he chases a completely innocent young guy down the road until he winds up in a horrible accident or when he threatens police officers with a gun to do as he says. Most of the time it's totally predictable where Michael Myers will pop up and who will die next, but then you must not forget that the slasher genre was still pretty new back in 1981 and that audiences were not yet as hard boiled as they are today.All in all, Halloween II is a worthy successor to the original. It may not be a genre cornerstone like part 1, but it's just as entertaining, if not more so. Unbelievable that this was made by Rick Rosenthal, the same guy who would later be responsible for the worst entry in the franchise (Halloween Resurrection), but even John Carpenter himself hasn't exactly developed positively the last 15 years or so, has he?

Stephens is a fantastic actress and she is given a lot more to do in this film than the first, and her hair is awesome! She will later return in Halloween H20 also. With the exception of Pamela Susan Shoop who plays Nurse Karen, the rest of the cast are given little depth.Setting the film in a hospital on Halloween night is a nice idea, for it gives a very chilling feel. However the hospital seems rather devoid of patients, even if it is late at night. The death scenes are also a little more inventive this time round, in particular Nurse Karen meets a very gruesome and painful demise. Admittedly there are flaws in this film - particularly in the continuity department, and apparently a lot of deleted scenes. So while viewing Halloween II it would probably be best to view it straight after watching the original Halloween and think of it not as a sequel, but the continuing terror of Michael Meyers, and plight of Laurie Strode!

Just a little.The town of Haddonfield is no longer clueless about a serial killer running amok. It's all over the news and there's a sense of dread and panic. It's Halloween night and the boogie man is coming for you.The first film genuinely captures that feel of Halloween day. You're carving the pumpkin. Kids are getting into their costumes. The leaves are falling. There's a breeze in the air.HalloweeN II captures that feeling when all the trick or treaters are getting home ready to dig into their bag of candy. The late night horror movie is on. And although things are winding down... it's still Halloween night. It's not over yet.This film is definitely a lot more hard core in the gore department. That's one thing I can applaud the original for is the fact that it succeeded in scaring the audience with practically no gore. But, being the horror fan I am, the gore factor doesn't bother me at all... in fact, it's something I'm glad this entry has.The chase scene through the hospital is very suspenseful. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are great as always. And the music here is a little more synthesized and really fits the atmosphere and mood of the film.I love the film. In fact, this is the one I used to watch on USA's Halloween marathon they used to have every year (what happened to the good old days of Up-All Night?) For a sequel it really doesn't get any better than this. The only other sequel that truly lives up to the original is HalloweeN H2O.

Michael kills a few townspeople and all hell breaks loose when he reaches the hospital and starts killing off all the doctors and nurses and finsh what he started to try and kill Laurie, will Dr Loomis get to him in time or will it be too late.Well to start off Halloween 2 is a great follow up and I'm so sick and tired of snobby nosed critics slagging it off. Halloween 2 is a worthy follow up, it still creates the tension of the first one maybe not on the same level but it's still a good film. The best part is when Michael reaches the hospital and starts killing everyone and the scene where Michael kills the nurse in front of Laurie is intense and plus the big chase scene towards the end with Michael and Laurie is really nerve racking and well done.Donald Pleasence (Loomis) is great as always he really shows the more manic side to his character and gives a passionate, riveting performance. Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie) giving in my opinion an even greater performance than in part one although she does make one or two mistakes but what final girl doesn't, Jamie Lee Curtis is definitely the best final girl ever. Nancy Stephens (Marion) doesn't have much to do but get into Loomis's way but she does an OK job. Lance Guest (Jimmy) does a good job whose sweet and lovable. Dick Warlock (The Shape) is the scariest looking Michael in the whole series.All in all Halloween 2 may not be as great as the first one but it's still brilliant and also does what every other horror movie sequel does more violence and a bigger body count, and it's definitely much better than most of the other Halloween sequels.

The original Halloween was terrifying at its time the idea of a killer that never stops was completely original and has since been copied to death. Friday the 13th is blatant rip-off of Halloween. So now a few years after the release of the critically acclaimed original Halloween 2 continues the story beginning exactly where the first ended. Halloween 2 is at times a dodgy film that doesn't maintain a good pace throughout but overall it is still enjoyable. Director Rick Rosenthal takes over the helm from John Carpenter, who directed Halloween. John Carpenter and his creative partner Debra Hill maintained their input into this one as the writers and producers.Pleasence brings the character of Dr. Loomis to life as he becomes more and more like one of his patients rather than a psychiatrist. While Dr. Loomis continues his quest to find the evil, Laurie is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. She begs not to be put to sleep, but the doctor ignores this and drugs her up so he can tend her stab would and cracked ankle bone. Unfortunately, Michael Myers learns where she is, and heads for the hospital himself.Rosenthal uses the hospital setting to great advantage. With only a skeleton crew working, the hospital is dark and empty. In several scenes, Rosenthal uses the darkness of the hospital to mask Michael's presence in a room only to have him appear as the light shifts, a truly chilling effect. Rosenthal originally wanted to go with more of the implied violence like Carpenter had used in the original, but he ended up shooting some very gory death scenes to help the film compete with some of its competition in the booming slasher film field of the early 80's so this is a very GORY film.Overall this is a really enjoyable movie but film purists will be put off by it and should stick with the original. A solid 7/10 in my mind.

And having survived the six gun shots at the end of part one, Michael spends the beginning of this film wandering around a trickor-treator-crowded Haddonfield until eventually learning of his sister's whereabouts from a passerby's stereo. Thus the carnage continues... Halloween II definitely lives up to the saying that bigger is better, but when it comes to movie sequels we all know that this is not always the case. In this film the entire formula is doubled, almost to a fault. The body count is higher, the story gets bigger, the death scenes are more inventive, and the scares come more often....all these elements are fine, and arguably above average in this type of film, except for the setting. The majority of the story takes place at the Haddonfield Clinic which is virtually empty and I find this to be a little unrealistic. Except for the kid with the mouth injury at the start of the film(and a few infants) there are NO other patients to be found in H.M.C. and the staff is quite small considering that it's Halloween night. Well, it's nice and all...lots of dark hallways, endless stairways, and vacant rooms for our now famous slasher-schizo. It's just insulting, sort of, especially for anyone who works at a hospital. I do realize, though, that the whole of this film does take place during the wee hours of the morning(when hospitals become a little more quiet), however, having a mother who is a nurse I know for a fact that there is no way a hospital is ever so empty, nor is there ever a chance to just stop and take a break to the therapy room. Come on now. I am also not a fan of Rick Rosenthal(the director)because he killed a lot of characters off screen in this film(and Resurrection), and John Carpenter even had to insist that he add more blood/gore because the film wasn't scary enough. Without the influences of Carpenter/Hill I believe Halloween II would have been an even bigger mess. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie. I just believe that this particular director needed a little guidance in several areas including, among others, pacing and logic.Being a slasher fan, nonetheless, I must mention the death scenes which rise from four(from part one)to about nine or ten. One nurse(during her therapy break)gets her face held under the water which Michael raised to scorching temperatures. Another gets air pumped into her brain with a syringe and one of the last ones gets a scalpel in the back. The gore is great especially in the Major Surgery scene with Jimmy and Mrs. Alves. There is good suspense as well, like when Laurie is waiting for the elevator to open and Michael is getting closer...and closer...and closer...On another note Halloween II was the first horror film that I ever saw, even before it's predecessor. I didn't mind the mindless fun of it then, and I really don't now. It will always hold a spot in my own movie collection and Halloween night horror marathons wouldn't be the same without it. I will definitely recommend this as a must-see in the Halloween franchise.7/10 for the mindless thrills/buckets of blood approach.

Meanwhile with the entire town of Haddonfield is in chaos of fear & rage following Michaels reign of terror, with the police combing every area of the town in their search for the madman, completely unaware that he has taken up residence within the confines of the local hospital. Meanwhile Dr. Loomis (the returning DONALD PLESEANCE) has discovered a terrifying link between both Michael & Laurie.Gifted with a much larger budget than what JOHN CARPENTER had to work with on his 1978 original, HALLOWEEN II is slicker, gorier & just as suspenseful as the original. The film also benefits from the rare opportunity that most sequels don't have, in that pretty much the entire team both in front & behind the camera of the original film returns here, with JOHN CARPENTER & DEBRA HILL serving as writers & producers. Director RICK ROSENTHAL steps behind the camera (He would later return for HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION) & does really good here as Carpenters replacement. Much like Carpenter, he makes sure the camera is almost like a character itself, gliding through many scenes & serving as the POV of Michael as he moves through the darkness. He manages to deliver several cool shots & stages a series of effective scare sequences & manages to capture all the tension, terror, stalk & chase sequences at all the right angles. What should also be noted, is how some additional shots were later done by JOHN CARPENTER, who not only prepared a special TV version for this film, but also shot some additional scenes for the TV debut of his original film, featuring many of the main cast members of the original. While DEAN CUNDEY'S marvellous cinematography help's keep continuity of the original film's look & style. In fact, you can watch both films in one setting & it feels like one long continuous movie. HALLOWEEN II also marks the welcomed debut of composer ALAN HOWARTH, who went on to score several more instalments in the series (he co- wrote this films theme with original composer Carpenter) & the score is easily one of the best, most eeriest scores to ever grace a horror movie! The film also marks the first mentioning of Samhain, the druid precursor to Halloween, not only would the legend surrounding Samhain been played to full fruition in the unrelated third instalment, but would also come to play in many of the sequels story lines (especially in HALLOWEEN THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS). Despite the fact that almost the entire film takes place within the confines of a hospital, thanks to Dean Cundey's excellent lightning strategies, the empty almost carnivorous hallways, are just bathed in shadows & darkness, with even the well lit hallways, emanating an almost eerie feel, you feel Michael could leap out of the shadows at almost any second. While many slasher films have been set at hospital, they haven't been very successful in terms of adding atmosphere like HALLOWEEN II managed, in fact this sequel blows away any horror film set at a hospital because of this.On the downside however, I will say that HALLOWEEN II while an impressive effort, also happens to be one of the many horror films made at the time to fall victim to the current state of the horror genre. Following Friday The 13th's huge box office success & receiving a lukewarm reaction from studio heads & fans over his previous film THE FOG, Carpenter & company were forced to up the gore quotient, come up with far more elaborate on screen dispatches & up the films body count, which results in many characters being introduced for the sole purpose of killing them off, resulting in a somewhat less effective film than the original, which was so cut & dried about such matters & focused it's attention more on suspense & tension than lingering gore effects & a concern over how big the body count was. As a result of the films shift in tone & execution, HALLOWEEN II comes off as more of a sequel/clone to the Friday The 13th series than it does it's original. Carpenters decision to make both Michael & Laurie siblings, while an interesting concept, adds nothing new to the plot & in many ways cheapens the films story. I personally felt the original film was much more effective, in that we assume that the only reason he was stalking & trying to kill Laurie & her friends is because she was the first girl he saw, since escaping & that by her coming near his home & touching it was almost as if because she wound up being contaminated as a result of doing such (In fact Carpenter would later regret this plot point) & despite Curtis reprising her role of Laurie, she has nothing to do here, spending most of the films running time (up until the last fifteen minutes) confined to a hospital bed. All in all, HALLOWEEN II is highly recommended for fans & one of the best sequels ever made! Despite the climax, which makes it look like Michael Myers has met his fiery demise, he would return as the series main villain in HALLOWEEN 4 THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS.

Some of the first film's key personnel have returned for the sequel, including ace cinematographer Dean Cundey, who uses the wide Panavision frame in painterly fashion, thereby ensuring a visual uniformity between the two productions. The movie opens with a memorable title sequence - set to Carpenter's immortal theme music, enhanced by a Dolby soundtrack - in which a spectral jack o'lantern dissolves into a grinning skull, setting a tone which Rosenthal sustains throughout the entire picture.The opening fifteen minutes are terrific, an exhilarating combination of atmosphere, suspense and impressive visual technique. But the narrative quickly succumbs to routine plotting and a series of mediocre set-pieces, centered around one of the most understaffed hospitals in movie history! Donald Pleasence gets all the best lines in his role as the haunted Dr. Loomis (We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves), and Curtis does her best with an underwritten role, though few of the actors are stretched by the material. The gore quotient has been upped this time around, the result of post-production tampering by Carpenter, who added extra 'kill' footage against Rosenthal's wishes, and there's a plot twist at the halfway mark which probably contributed to the film's poor reception in 1981. Nice touches abound, however, including a ghostly flashback to Laurie's childhood as she comes face to face with the young Michael Myers; and the tears of blood which roll down the killer's face during his final showdown with the survivors of his grisly rampage. For all its flaws, the movie has much to recommend it, and was followed by the unrelated (and poorly conceived) HALLOWEEN III SEASON OF THE WITCH (1982).

In regards to horror, it does have a lot going for it to classify it as such. For one thing, about 70% of the film takes place at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital which provides for a genuinely unsettling atmosphere. Hospitals are just plain creepy, let alone empty ones from the late 70's/early 80's. To set the mood before the mass homicide begins, we get close up shots of thick needles entering veins, drawing blood and injecting sedatives (by a drunk doctor no less!). Also, a young kid with his mother comes to the hospital early on, bleeding profusely from a razor blade embedded between his lips. How the kid could've missed this thing sticking out of his apple/candy, I'll never know. When Michael Myers enters the fray, he metes out his own brand of health care with the hospital's arsenal; butchering nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers and security with scalpels, intra-venous drip, a scalding-hot therapy pool and of course good old-fashioned syringe needles through various facial features.Although Halloween II picks up directly where the first film ended, it is a massive departure from the 1978 indie flick and seems to cater more to fans of the then emerging slasher genre than to an audience looking to recapture the suspense of the original Halloween.Halloween and Halloween II both take place during the course of All Hallow's Eve, 1978. The film begins with a recap of the ending of the incomparably superior first film. After Myers had taken a knitting needle to the carotid artery, a clothes hanger through the eye, a steak knife in the diaphragm, six bullets to the head and torso, and a two-story plummet off a balcony, he manages to escape to the shadows within thirty seconds.The plot of this first sequel is extremely simple After a bit of a breather from his massive injuries, Myers mysteriously recovers and continues on his quest to rid the world of that bothersome goodie two shoes Laurie Strode (Jamie-Lee Curtis) by following her to the hospital. Meanwhile Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is once again on the hunt for the escaped mental patient and after discovering some very interesting details about the Shape's lineage, pursues him to the hospital for an EXPLOSIVE final throw-down.Halloween II has a few scary bits; the unique score of the film helping to accentuate these moments. There is an extremely tense part towards the end of the film as Laurie crawls across the hospital parking lot unable to scream for help at Dr. Loomis with the Shape slowly stalking behind her. The operating room scene at the very end is notably creepy too.The film also had a couple standout characters. Although I think the audience is supposed to despise the profane ambulance driver Budd (Leo Rossi), I couldn't help but get some laughs from this guy. His condescension to co-workers and his creative rendition of Amazing Grace come to mind. Donald Pleasence was in fine form for his second kick at the can as the obsessed psychiatrist, maintaining deadpan seriousness in the role and giving some much needed credibility to the film. Finally, I would like to mention the brief appearance of The Marshal (John Zenda), the man ordered to transport Dr. Loomis out of Haddonfield, who after forced at gunpoint to assist the good doctor, unfortunately gets his throat slit ear-to-ear by a seemingly shot-to-death Myers. Several characters from the original film come back for cameos including Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers), Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens), and Nancy Loomis with a brief appearance as the corpse of Annie Brackett. As well, don't miss a brief glimpse of Dana Carvey, who makes his film debut as a reporter's personal assistant.I am not going to be the last however to admit the film's shortcomings. The slasher movie sellout is really what hurts this one. Half of Myer's victims are absolutely pointless and his methods of dispatch border on absurd. Had he gotten THAT bored with the stabbin' and the stranglin' that he had to attach an IV to one unlucky nurse and drain her of every last drop of blood? At the beginning, I was really surprised he didn't off the old couple watching Night Of The Living Dead that he swiped a knife from just for the heck of it. I always assumed Myers was only intent on killing Laurie Strode and anyone who got in his way, but this was certainly not the case in this film. He methodically murders the entire hospital staff before even looking for Laurie, when he probably could've went straight to her room and done the deed without incident, the place was so empty. Plot logic aside, the other major complaint I had was with the mask. It looked so eerie and sinister in the first film; for one thing we never saw the eyes, adding to our overall fear of what is unknown about him. In Halloween II, they changed it completely and decided to go for the opposite effect and have his eyes visible in almost every shot he's in. The mask is pure crap and almost comical in some shots ('and lots of wavy hair like Liberace!').As is commonplace with sequels, shocking developments and origin stories are always ubiquitous, and Halloween II is no exception. Although it would have been much better if we never found out anything about Myers or his motives, if there had to be some account of his back-story, I'm pleased that it came from a script by John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Incidentally, I absolutely love the association made between Myers and the Celtic festival of Samhain. What better way to provide a source to his madness than connecting it with the actual holiday the film series is centered on?Halloween II is one of the first horror films I can remember watching as a kid. However, I do seem to recall an alternate ending on the television version I saw a dozen years ago. As Laurie Strode is being carted off in an ambulance (to a presumably different hospital I suppose) Jimmy (the only other survivor) sits up beside her and they share a bit of dialogue that I completely forget now. In the DVD version however, it is simply Laurie sitting in the ambulance staring into oblivion as the scene cuts back to the earlier hospital inferno where Myers burns beyond recognition to the &#150; in this case disturbing &#150; tune Mr. Sandman by The Chordettes. A very effective ending to illustrate the intended demise of Michael Myers and any story associated with him.Overall, a half-way decent sequel, but personally I think is edged out slightly by 1988's Halloween 4 The Return Of Michael Myers which although it presented still more complexities to the once-basic story, it re-invigorated the series with some new life while at the same time brought back some of the suspense of the original film.

Myers is going to the hospital to stalk and , given the right opportunity, kill Curtis.  Along the way he enjoys himself slashing the occasional teen girl in peril here and there.  Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis and a police force of incompetence scour the city for Myers.  This film is a pretty decent sequel as sequels go;  it definitely does not have the bite of the first film, and is more explicit in what it shows in terms of graphic violence and nudity.  The continuation effect is carried off fairly well, with only Curtis visibly older.  Curtis does not have much to do in this one, however.  The bulk of the film takes place in a hospital that seems dead on a night when it should be busy.  Myers has a field day killing nurses, doctors, and guards.  The script, written by Debra Hill and John Carpenter, manages to create some meaning of why Myers is doing what he is doing, but there are many loose ends.  There is a whole sub-plot about Celtic druidism that I am still not sure of why it was mentioned at all.  I believe it is a justification of Myers need to kill as well as his seemingly immortal nature.  The biggest difference between the film and its original is the direction.  Rick Rosenthal directs this one in much the same style as Carpenter did the first.  He does show lots more blood, including a rather tasteless scene with a child going to the hospital with a razor blade in his mouth.  Carpenter was able to create great suspenseful moments with minimal on-screen violence.  Rosenthal seems to lean more closely to the Friday the 13th school of direction.  He also includes a rather lengthy nude scene(that showcases the bounteous talents of Pamela Sue Shoop).  Pleasance does a great job as a thick slice of ham, bringing what little acting talent the film has to the foreground.

This is highlighted by the fact that this one really ups the body count and offers far more kills than expected as it manages to knock off the crew of the hospital first before going after the main victim, and that allows for more blood and gore than the original, which admittedly didn't have much, but this one blows it away with a ton of gruesome deaths. As well, this one contains a large amount of creepy stalking scenes that are far more suspenseful than expected, including two which rip-off the original but still manage to generate a jolt at the time. Following this, there's some high-energy action scenes of her trying to get away, and the drugged-up nature of the character trying to get away allows for even more suspense to be generated during the finale where it's a long, drawn-out chase around the depths of the hospital before getting to the main level again for an action-packed showdown, which ends the movie nicely.

Michael recovers, finds a new knife and discovers where Laurie is staying. He storms off after her as Loomis finds a young teen that resembles Michael and accidentally allows his death. At the hospital, the staff is anxiously awaiting Laurie's arrival as it has been a slow night. They don't anticipate all the other bodies that arrive with hers, and find any excuse to not work on her. As Michael stalks through the hospital dispatching everyone who works there systematically, no one wonders why everyone is missing. Loomis is ordered out of the city and back to the psychiatric hospital, and while being escorted away by the Marshal (John Zenda), he makes a startling realization about Laurie and her relationship with Michael. He returns to the hospital with the Marshal and his assistant (Nancy Stephens) to find the hospital deserted off personal and only Laurie left alive. After a series of skillful escapes, they trap Michael in the gas room and blow up the hospital. The Good News This is the most graphic of the sequels, partly because there are so many kills in here. We have a nice shot of a melted face, a hammer-smashed skull, a needle sticking out of an eye, and shrapnel fragments embedded in the face. Michael also gets his eyes shot out, but only the blood flow from it is seen. He also slashes a throat, but that is a moot point considering the other kills. While I'm thinking of it, I would like to comment on the needle scene. We never see the needle thrust in, just the after-affect, but that whole sequence is a prime example of how true horror films use mood to get scares. A nurse wanders into a doctors' office to call him in for duty, but his back is turned and he doesn't respond to his name. The nurse walks up to him and turns the chair around to see him dead. She silently staggers back out of the room, but behind her in the dark, Michael's mask slowly forms above her head. He lunges at her and plants another needle in her face. It is a brilliant sequence that has quickly become one of my favorites because of three classic elements The low lighting in the room, the innocent victim, and the killer's appearance in the scene. These three elements come together to form the scene. With the low lighting in the room, shadows are cast around, allowing for Michael to easily hide in. the helpless victim is his target, and the slow formation of his mask behind her are very chilling upon first watch. This scene alone is worth the price of admission, but what guarantees it is the nude scenes of the nurse played by Pamela Susan Shoop. She has a very nice body for that time, and the scene is pretty tasteful, without it being done simply for the sake of showing nudity. Following a classic slasher rule, she is immediately killed for doing so, and her death is another highlight. I don't want to give too much away, but it is a great scene that is very eerie. After dispatching her companion, Michael secretly turns up the temperature in the therapeutic pool where they are, and comes out to Shoop, who believes it is her companion. She talks to him for several seconds, then asks him a question, and when he doesn't respond, she looks up at him and sees that it isn't Michael, who promptly dispatches her as well. Another great highlight, as it continues on, is the discovery of Laurie and Michael's relationship. For the three of us left who don't know, Laurie is revealed to be Michael's brother who was hid from him after he was sent to prison. This is the storyline that set up `Halloween H2O' and it is discovered her. Of the entire competent cast, Pleasance as always does a respectable job as Loomis. I think he has finally come to terms with the role, and he has a lot of fun with it.         The Bad News Despite getting a top billing, Jamie is essentially wasted in the movie. She lies in her hospital bed for most of the movie, and when the staff starts disappearing, she finally wanders out and finds Michael. It wasn't a great decision to do so, as it left her out of action for most of the movie. This really is my only gripe against the movie.The Final Verdict Following such a successful film like `Halloween' is a tough act for any film, but this one manages to pull it off in strides. It is thoroughly entertaining all the way through, it isn't as graphic as it could've been, and it has a high re-watch ability factor. This is definitely the best of the sequels and is tied with part 4 as the most entertaining of the sequels. It is highly recommended to all fans of the original and slasher fans of any kind.    Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and Nudity.

This first Halloween sequel is no exception. It breaks no ground and simply tries to give a sense of continuity to the classic boxed in a much less ambitious format.The result is an average B movie that on its own is not utterly without merit but that cannot possibly live up to the originality of Halloween. However, unlike it happens in later entries to the franchise that deteriorate the fundamental elements and twist them beyond recognition Halloween II is grounded in the universe of Michael Myres. The chronological linkage that places the action just a few hours after the events of the first movie adds to this cohesiveness within the mythos as do several technical details- the first perspective shooting employed early in the movie is the best example of this- that quote Halloween in a rather literal way. In terms of atmosphere the setting of an ill lit and mostly abandoned hospital is canonical as far as horror goes and it does work in creating a hunting ground for a stalking boogieman. The death scenes are also interesting enough and the narrative culminates in a climax that is prefaced by a clever scene in which the use of sound is on what everything hinges. However, there are many faults in Halloween II. The continuity glitches are such that are noticeable even by an average viewer, character-wise there is hardly any development, the plot moves along by numbers and very often takes too many liberties. But perhaps the most harmful element in this movie is the pseudo Celtic nonsense that is added with the purpose of explaining just what Michael Myres is, an attempt that fails on all levels and that was dismissed by fans as it was accessory and unnecessary. Ultimately, Halloween II lowers the standards of the first movie, what in good in it are the references to Carpenter's work- from the intro to Myres' mask- and what brings it down are the innovations it tries to introduce in the canonical universe by explaining Myres' existence as well as its being so much humble in all areas, be it in terms of scope, cinematography and relevance.

They try all kinds of killing methods in this movie, so I guess this is the 80s slasher effect. While in the first halloween movie, they make it simple and the killer has limited methods of murder. Here Michael experiments with different ideas. And the body count just explodes in this one. He has no time to freak people out and watch them do things. He needs to get to the business right away. The pace is the biggest difference. There are a flurry of murders in this one in the first hour itself. Then the movie slows down and tries to go back to the pace of the first Halloween movie. I thought it was a nice idea to just resume from the ending of the 1st movie. I don't know how many sequels do that. Mostly they just do a 3 years later kind of a thing and move on. But here somehow they try to recreate everything (though this movie is made 3 years later) continue the story from that time itself. Jamie Lee curtis doesn't have many lines at all in the movie. I guess nobody has time to discuss girl talk and gossip. Of course there is the clichéd jerk character who is necessary for some nudity or light moments (in the midst of all the carnage of course). There is only one scene of nudity which doesn't really affect the pace of the movie. The indestructible concept again raises its ugly head again. Maybe this is one idea I was never comfortable with. But it would have been cool if they had just ended with this sequel. Because he seems bigger than all vampires put together. Because they have some weaknesses, this guy has none.

Halloween II (1981) is no different. After receiving such strong acclaim it was decided to whip out a continuation of the William Shatner mask wearing serial killer. And to be honest, it's one of the most tightly knit horror sequels viewers may see in a while. Compared to many other sequels, it doesn't start a year, month or even day later. It starts right at the ending of the Halloween (1978) movie and picks up right where it left off. It literally bookends the first movie and starts chugging along again with Michael's violent killing spree. There's not much of a change at all in this story. After the traumatizing experience of the night Michael Myers came to his hometown, Laurie Strode (Jaime Lee Curtis) is rushed to the local hospital where she is prepped to be taken care of. Little does she realize that Michael is still on the loose looking for her even after Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) loaded six slugs into him.This basically sets up the whole plot for the rest of the movie. Michael Myers makes his way to find Laurie, killing people in his path while Dr. Loomis and the police trail behind him, trying to find where he plans to be next. Interestingly enough, that's all this sequel needed. Fans enjoyed Myers so much in the first movie that they couldn't resist to pass up another feature involving him. John Carpenter (who decided no to direct this time) and Debra Hill's writing pretty much stays the same in this installment. But here's where audiences may get frustrated - the character of Laurie Strode still is of main focus but her character doesn't do much this time. For the most part she lies around in the hospital until the third act hits.But the writing also includes a little more explanation to why Michael Myers is so determined to kill Laurie, which does make it nice to get a little more background. However, it's still not enough to cover why he can withstand so many bullet wounds. That's utterly insane to imagine. The gore is also a little stronger here and that's understandable since the franchise was competing with several other horror films as well. Lastly, it's appreciated that John Carpenter's score sticks to the same theme and motifs that was created from in first but this time, more synths were used. Unfortunately this also removes the eerie atmosphere that was established from the first movie with piano keys. It's a different sound but not as effective. It's still a very strong sequel.For most horror sequels, the story is not this closely knit but it is done very competently here. With minor changes, the story of Michael Myers continues once more like it did in the first movie.

Minus all that, this dingy sequel is almost unbearably dull, lacking a plot, and pretty sadistic to boot. Even 'Friday the 13th', one of the first rip-offs out of the gate, tried harder than this.Undermining the original film's ambiguous ending, in which we weren't sure what had happened to the body of (possibly supernatural) killer Michael Myers, this opens with him toddling off around the corner before embarking on an indiscriminate slaughter through the hospital where survivor Jamie Lee Curtis has been taken to recover. Myers is after her, Donald Pleasence is again trying to stop him, and that's it for the plot, other than a revelation that comes out of nowhere and doesn't add very much.But none of it adds very much it's a very sequelly sequel, aware that there's nothing more to say and saying it with as little inspiration as possible. Surely the jumping cat false scare and the hand on the shoulder false scare were clichés even at the time? In one boring scene Curtis crawls along the ground as Myers plods towards her, all completely unnoticed by passers-by; in another boring scene a security guard pokes around interminably while we wait for him to get killed. If director Rick Rosenthal knows how to create suspense and atmosphere, he keeps it to himself.Most of the dialogue consists of repetitious news reports that endlessly rehash the details of Myers's escape and killing spree, which leaves little for Pleasence to do other than repeat his actions from the first movie, and even less for Curtis to do. The supporting characters, of course, are there only to be horribly murdered. If not for the weird diversion the series took with its third instalment the next sequel may well have been Myers standing at the end of a conveyor belt slashing people as they roll off it.

The main problem with Halloween II is that it is pretty much a rehash of the previous film, and is more in touch with the numerous imitators its predecessor had spawned over the three years since that dark, fateful night in 1978.Halloween II is a direct follow-up to Halloween, which depicted an escaped maniac stalking and killing the teenage babysitters of a small (fictional) Illinois town called Haddonfield on Halloween night. The sequel picks up with a brief recap of Halloween's final moments where Dr. Sam Loomis (the late Donald Pleasance) pumped six bullets into the chest of knife-wielding mass murderer Michael Myers. In the process, Loomis also saved the life of would-be victim Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).Laurie is rushed to the hospital to recover from a few minor injuries and the trauma of the night's events. Loomis, meanwhile, continues his obsessive hunt for Michael Myers before he has a chance to kill again. As fate would have it, Myers shows up at the hospital and begins killing the doctors and nurses on staff that night. And later on in the picture, we get a shocking revelation in that we learn just why Michael Myers is so intent on specifically targeting poor Laurie Strode.For a horror sequel, Halloween II is surprisingly well-made, and does have some pretty suspenseful moments - though none of this is on par with the utter perfection of Halloween. As I stated earlier, because Halloween II is so much in league with the slasher movie spawn of its predecessor, it feels more like those cheap imitations, and not a worthwhile sequel to a landmark horror picture. The characters are paper-thin, the violence is much more graphic and palpable (the first movie contained only a minimum of violence and gore), and the whole thing just stinks of rehash - although it does, in fact, continue the story of the first film, rather than just repeating the exact same scenario over again.One of the big bonuses of Halloween II is its synthesizer-based score, which was composed by Carpenter himself and frequent collaborator Alan Howarth (they had just worked on Carpenter's Escape from New York and were preparing for The Thing). The score for Halloween II contains many of the same motifs (including the signature 5/4 time rhythm) but this score relies much heavier on electronics, rather than acoustics, as it was on the first picture. But like the first movie, the score fits neatly into any scene it's placed and succeeds in managing to create some pretty suspenseful scenes.Overall, Halloween II was never going to repeat the massive success of Halloween, which is unquestionably one of the best and greatest horror movies of all time. But unlike most horror movie sequels since then, Halloween II is a waste of time, but not the effort that was put into making it.After all, it is just More of the Night HE Came Home...6/10 "},{"Title":"Good Sequel That Probably Should've Been The Last!","Date":"27 February 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis star in this 1981 horror sequel.

While Dr. Loomis hunts the streets for Myers the killer has already begin another murderous rampage at Haddonfield Hospital.To the writer/producer team John Carpenter and Debra Hill's credit it picks up where the first left off giving it a nice air of continuity.  Halloween 2 is a basic killing spree sequel that builds on the suspenseful original with a revelation of who Strode really is but more so adds a lot of bloody deaths. That said, there's little story and literally goes from one death to the next.Jamie Lee Curtis plays the shell shocked ex-babysitter in distress perfectly although there is little room for her character to develop due to the scripts time scale. Donald Pleasence is as loopy and obsessed with Michael as ever and is the weight in this limited event. Dick Warlock plays Michael Myers and does a good job especially when taking a bullet or two.Although all the extras are Michael fodder they do enough to keep you interested. Veteran Dean Cundey's cinematography is the star of the show. Despite some choppy editing, possibly caused by Carpenters re-shoots and drawn out closing, Rick Rosenthal direction is more than satisfactory encompassing some suspense in the dark and ominous lit hospital.Overall it builds on the unstoppable killing machine film concept and while not perfect its a good sequel to a series that arguably could have finished there.

I already knew it was gonna suck, and it wouldn't be as good as the first, but I watched it anyway. It didn't suck as bad, but still pretty bad. The kills are more creative, but a little stupid, the idea is gay, and some of the things in the movie are retarded. Plus, its basically somewhat the same story as the first, just a different time.It takes place the same exact night right where the first left off. Michael is on the loose while the doctor goes and hunts him down some more like he did in the first. Meanwhile, Laurie is sent to the hospital, and as you would guess, Michael still wants to kill her, which is why he heads straight there. The hospital is where most of the movie takes place, and it just turns into a stupid slapstick horror film. Plus, for a horror film, its really not that scary.All its trying to do is copy and be like the first, only with more gruesome kills, but ultimately fails. The Carpenter theme returns, with a half hour long opening. Good luck trying to stay awake, because it takes awhile for things to get moving. Most of the time, people are just fooling around, and not much happens. The ending is where most of the stuff happens.The dumbest scene in the film is where they mistake Michael with another kid wearing the exact same mask! As he's being chased, he runs in the middle of the road, and gets run over by a cop car, which rams him into another car in the middle of the road, piercing him in the middle. The scene made me almost cry to how much they mocked the first.As I expected, it sucked. But i'll admit that it still devotes itself to the original, and if it had to be made, then find, make it.

Fans are in for treat not a trick this time around, the night he came home just got extended.Okay, from the first we gathered that Micheal Myers is not the average serial psychotic killer but he is more of a evil spirit if you pick up the messages Loomis gives in both films, Loomis is still after Micheal at the same time. Micheal happens to stalk a particular girl Laurie, in the day and by the night she is injured, continuing the rest of the night in Haddonfield Hospital where Laurie is admitted to.John did not direct this one, but still was involved in the film by writing it and said to have directed a few sequences. John's writing is great, the main twist in the film is pretty well handled too even though it does change the view of Micheal altogether. As a sequel its great. This one is as scary and as atmospheric as the prequel. As a thriller its even better. To live up to the prequel, maybe it does letdown.The downfall to this film has to be some unwanted scenes and maybe it went on a little long, or some wanted scenes that were just not there. But the biggest drop has to be the exposure of Micheal, in the first we did not see very much of this figure but here there are way too many closeups. Director's fault.Overall, a good example of a sequel where the writers pick it up the second where the prequel ends. Neat writing. Well directed and good a thriller.

I fall into the former category. I saw Halloween II before I saw the original Halloween and I guess it kind of ruined the first movie for me, because so much more happens in the sequel. The first movie takes a long time to get going, characters have to be set up and a lot of stalking happens before Michael Myers strikes for the first time. The sequel doesn't have to do any of that and takes off right from the ending of Halloween. John Carpenter turned down the chance to direct this sequel, but he co-wrote it, produced it and did the excellent synthesized score with Alan Howarth (the start of a long and successful collaboration between them.) Rick Rosenthal was chosen to helm the sequel, but Carpenter came back later to direct some additional scenes that added more gore to the movie. (Carpenter was criticized for this but slasher films had become gorier in the three years since the first film and he was responding to the market. Also, Michael Myers can't spend a long time stalking his victims anymore. Doctor Loomis and the police know he's on the loose in Haddonfield when this film starts and he's wounded and, like a wounded animal, at his most dangerous. That's why his kill count quadruples here. So it is a logical progression.)Dean Cundey, the great cinematographer whose atmospheric, prowling camera-work added so much to the first movie, thankfully also came back for this movie. Without him, there would not have been the same feeling of menace throughout.In the first Halloween movie, we find out that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has a crush on a boy called Ben Tramer and wants to go to the Prom with him. Well, as if having all her friends murdered by The Shape and barely surviving herself isn't bad enough, she also has the added trauma of Ben Tramer being flattened by a police car in this movie and bursting into flames against a van! As Laurie is drugged up and in shock in the hospital, she would have only discovered what had happened to Ben after she'd recovered from it all. Another kick in the guts for poor Laurie.People have always wondered why the hospital that Laurie is taken to, Haddonfield Memorial, is so deserted. That could easily have been addressed by Carpenter when he wrote the script. I've always figured that the hospital in Halloween II was a lot like the police station in Assault on Precinct 13 in that it was closing down and about to be re-located somewhere else. Laurie just happened to arrive on its last night in operation with a skeleton crew.It's easy to see what movies John Carpenter was watching when he was writing Halloween II; 1. ALIEN (1979) In 1974. John Carpenter co-wrote Dark Star with Dan O'Bannon. It was a comedy about how an alien gets on board a spaceship and creates havoc. O'Bannon subsequently recycled that plot as a horror movie in the screenplay for Alien. It clearly had a big impact on Carpenter. Halloween II is essentially a re-working of Alien with a hospital replacing the spaceship, The Shape standing in for the Xenomorph and nurses and paramedics substituted for the blue-collar space crew. In Halloween II one of the female characters berates a male colleague for swearing, just as in Alien. Alien influenced Carpenter so much that his next movie was a remake of The Thing in 1982.2. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) The big twist in the sequel to Star Wars was the shocking revelation that Darth Vader is actually Luke Skywalker's father. Carpenter tries the same trick with Halloween II, by making Laurie Strode the sister of Michael Myers. Again, Carpenter was criticized for this plot twist, but, again, it's quite logical. If Myers stalked his victims in the first film at random, why would he go to all the trouble of coming after Laurie again at the hospital? The sister twist is the reason.3. Dracula (1979) Dracula concludes with Van Helsing (Laurence Olivier) being impaled by Dracula (Frank Langella) with one of his own stakes, but, as he dies, he makes sure that he defeats the vampire by sticking a hook in his back and having him hoisted into the sunlight where he disintegrates. Halloween II ends in a similar way with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) being stabbed in the stomach by Michael Myers with a scalpel, but, as he dies (or so we thought at the time), he turns on the gas in the operating theater of the hospital and blows himself and his patient Michael Myers to smithereens. Even though nobody could have survived such an enormous explosion, box office demanded that both Loomis and Myers lived and they returned for Halloween 4 in 1988 (just as well, as it was a pretty good film that wouldn't have been the same without the great Donald Pleasence.) I like Halloween II. It was made during that golden period in John Carpenter's career between 1976 with Assault on Precinct 13 and ending in 1982 with the critically-mauled but now-loved The Thing. After that, Carpenter's heart didn't seem to be in it. There were flashes of the old master in They Live in 1988 and Vampires in 1997, but he was never the same director after the critics tore him apart for making The Thing. The great thing is, we still have his movies from that golden period to watch and enjoy. Halloween II is a regular in my DVD player around October 31st and always will be. If Rob Zombie's Halloween II is even half as good, I'll be happy.

There are even some lines that are repeated from the first movie but are updated, this is mainly from the Dr. Loomis character. This movies budget is higher then the first movie but is still fairly low, just passing 2.5 million dollars to make, and the movie looks great, even with a low budget.I did not like the music in this movie, changing the tone of the Halloween Theme made the theme less scary. Instead of using the classic piano tune, they changed it to almost like an organ, which doesn't work.Overall, no matter what flaws, this movie is wonderful.

Halloween II gives it the budget, and the two of them could possibly make a decent single feature cut except that both of them attempt to use a form of rising tension that could possibly be undermined by putting the two back-to-back.Halloween I has its share of absurdities, but most of them are silly and accepted anyway... Halloween II is a little worse, but still manages to be relatively decent. Sure, Michael being unable to force open an elevator when he can break through thick wooden doors seems a little ridiculous, but the shot of Michael walking right through the glass door near the end just can't be understated for cool factor. It's an enjoyable flick, even if sometimes it gets a little dumb.I think the revealing twist about Jamie Lee Curtis' character's true relationship to Michael was probably a good idea at the time, but it's very random ultimately. Remember that Michael stalked Jamie Lee Curtis and the little boy in the first film, basically because they were the first people he saw. I guess he might have realized then, but it seems a far stretch. I don't think, overall, that relationship really works out as well as Carpenter thought it would.This movie is also more removed away from the voyeuristic and sexualized aspect of the first film, almost adding in sex by proxy and taking more glee in the actual killing spree.

With none of the set up of the first movie, Halloween 2 comes off as a flat, by the numbers retread with none of the suspense of the original. Because Halloween 2 focuses on action more than character, we never care whether anyone is wiped out or not,as they're nothing but characters in a slasher flick. Perhaps i'm hard on Halloween 2, especially given the fact on how much I love the first movie, however there is no imagination taken with the series and it's clear that Rick Rosenthal has no idea how to advance the story. Especially since we know who the killer is, there is no set up and it's just a dull turkey-shoot of victims getting it one by one.

I reviewed part 1 and I think I have made a few Halloween fans mad as I talked about how it wasn't as great as what it was cracked up to be. I love part one but it was not scary nor was there a lot of killings. It was a bit dry and bored me at times.Part 2 is a straight up slasher with lots of killings and a few scary scenes. It was a couple years after the first one and slasher movies were a dime a dozen by this time, but we slasher fans loved part 2 of Halloween because it took what so many of the slashers had evolved to and made one of the better slashers of the decade. It had become a cult fave because of the success of the first one and it had no problem quickly getting recognition.It takes off right where part one ended and that was interesting. It was cool because when you watch the two back to back you cant even tell that they were filmed a few years apart. I loved it and just like Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers shows us here that he is not one to mess with and he will kill anyone who gets in his way.I've heard so many people put it down and saying that Halloween should've been left alone and no sequels should have been made. I think though and I believe this 100 percent that if there had been no sequels that Michael Myers would not have been a household name and although part one would've lived on, it would not have been anywhere near as successful as it is now. The whole realm of horror and especially slashers would have been so much different and crappy without part 2 being made. It showed that a sequel can be successful and it helped movies such as Friday THE 13TH, SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and such by showing them that no one wants to see them die in the first one &#150; we want sequels forever. I love slashers and although many are bad still it's better than going to the theatre and seeing another damn Tom Cruise, George Clooney or Julie Roberts crappy blockbuster reigning supreme. Horror has almost taken over Hollywood and I couldn't be happier to see it. I will admit though that back in the day horrors were a dime a dozen, but only the good stuff made it to theatre - nowadays anything makes it. Companies like Miramax and Lionsgate are tossing out so many its crazy and they all seem to become pretty successful.I think many of these should go straight to video and quit going to theatres and making people see them &#150; it's giving horror a bad name. 99 percent of remakes suck ass and sequels are carbon copies of all that came before. Love seeing horror in the box office but hate seeing crap and knowing that no one even tries anymore. Anyone with a camera and/or a computer can make a horror movie and any movie company will buy it and everyone will watch it. What has happened to us people? Sequels are great, but give us a motive, give us a reason. Do not make these movies about someone coming back and killing more people; give me a reason why they had to come back. Halloween has done that better than anyone.Remakes should focus on movies that need a remake, stuff that has been forgotten, not classics. Why remake stuff like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, HALLOWEEN, PSYCHO, EVIL DEAD, and THE OMEN? We love those movies and everyone has seen the originals and loves them. Movies like Psycho, which was almost an exact copy of the original &#150; stupid waste of time.I want Originality and I want some talent and well written horror movies.

Rick Rosenthal (who many years later directed the disappointing Halloween Resurrection) does a good job in this film, and the acting is great. Jamie Lee Curtis is wonderful in this, just as she always is. The same goes for Donald Pleasance. The Halloween theme is used again appropriately. Michael is menacing and creepy. It has some genuinely scary moments, and interesting death scenes. There were some creative death scenes (hot tub particularly, quite nasty). But the long chase between Michael and Laurie is just great. It was all very well done and I liked the way the film ended too.Bottom line is, if you enjoyed the original Halloween, you should enjoy this one. Get a few friends, and kick back and watch Halloween and Halloween II back to back, you should enjoy it.

Jamie Lee Curtis is solid, but we mostly hear her scream her lungs out. She really doesn't have that much to do. Donald Pleasence is OK, not as good as in the first one due mostly to some hysterical overacting at times. The Shape (portrayed here by a stuntman instead of Nick Castle) is pretty decent, but not as good as Nick Castle was in the original. There's simply something missing.

HALLOWEEN II was about as slick as they got, but, while Donald Pleasence had plenty to do hunting down cinema's premiere Slasher (the cinematic cousin of Norman Bates), Jamie Lee Curtis could almost literally have phoned it in. More's the pity it was Laurie Strode who made the original so compelling (at least, to me); one couldn't help but root for her and her friends as the relentless killing machine stalked them to death. I once read an interview with John Carpenter in which he said that one idea of his was to have resumed the story years later, with Laurie living in a high rise apartment (think SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME!) when the killer returned (an idea that may have inspired HALLOWEEN H20, years later). Best of all would've been Carpenter's idea for an annual HALLOWEEN film, a la HALLOWEEN III, that ventured off in a new direction each time.

However, there's a legion of fans out there of the franchise that carry a treaty loyalty to the film and its cast and creators. Halloween II begins exactly at the end of the original film. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) runs downstairs into the front yard of the house he found Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in. He discovers that Myers has walked off from the spot where he landed after Loomis shot him several times knocking him off the 2nd story balcony. Laurie is rushed to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where she's admitted for treatment. Michael tracks her down to the hospital and begins killing the medical personnel one by one in his search for Laurie. Can Dr. Loomis track him down and end his reign of terror before Myers can get to his sister? Is Halloween II as good as or better than its predecessor? Of course not. Is it good in its own right as an entertaining slasher film? I believe it is. Director Rick Rosenthal did what any man picking up the reigns from a master like John Carpenter would. First, he uses the same director of photography to capture the movie visually. Next, Rosenthal tries to hang on to the suspense that made the first movie a hit, but at the same time add more moments of gore to elevate it to a different level. Did it work all the time? No, it didn't. However, it did add all sorts of iconic moments that viewers still hang on to and celebrate to this day. Moments like the blood running down Myers' mask after Laurie shoots him in the eyes; the swishing of the scalpel as he blindly swings it in front of him trying to kill whoever gets in his way; the POV shots of the killer stalking while we hear his heavy breathing under the mask; and who can forget the scene where the mother is taking her little boy to the emergency room after he bit into an apple with a razor in it? That put Halloween in a bad light from the moment it first debuted in front of an audience. It's great to see a cast give such genuine performances in what many actors might write off as an opportunity to just pick up an easy paycheck. Jamie Lee Curtis returns in the role of Laurie Strode and isn't given a lot of dialogue to work with but does her best to deliver legitimate bursts of fear and anxiety as she crawls and stumbles around the hospital hiding from Michael Myers. Lance Guest (The Last Starfighter) plays paramedic Jimmy who is convincingly intent on keeping Laurie safe from Myers' clutches.

Whereas in the 1st film there's a rich texture of colour to the photography enhanced by well judged lighting and colour to convey atmosphere, in this we are given a cheap looking visual quality with harsh lights that blanch any atmosphere away. The sets look cheaply made, the quasi-amateur acting element of the cast are left high & dry by a paper thin script of mindless stabbings - when even a player of the ability of Pleasence is struggling, what hope do lesser younger talents have. The tautness of the 1st film achieved by a well judged script and direction, where the menace of the threat is quite as dramatic as the intermittent rare eruptions of an attack, in this (which has 3 times the body count as the 1st film to far less effect)is replaced by a series of poorly filmed murder scenes, which aren't scary in the least. Jamie L.C. - what is that thing stuck on top of her head! - is reduced by the non-existent script from the gawkily attractive and subtle heroine of the 1st film into a monosyllabic victim with nothing to do but run away from the camera whenever the word Action is given, and Donny Pleasence, a fine actor whom John Carpenter was lucky to get for a work as poor as this, is reduced with fast diminishing returns to a series of scenes continually trying to summon up the spell that he cast in the 1st film with the  ... the blackest eyes ... the devil's eyes scene.Direction - amateurish, no use of the power of the camera at all. Script - non existent (the only idea in the whole cheap charade is the word written on the school wall linking what the destructive force at the film's centre is to the pagan Celtic origins of Halloween, and how what's now a children's harmless seasonal event has a very different origin, but this intriguing concept isn't developed at all and a cheap hack'n slash job is cobbled on either side of it instead.

Michael has survived the gunshots and balcony fall to hide out within the suburban neighbourhood of a quite town Haddonfield, until he realizes that Laurie is being kept at the local hospital. On his trail are Dr. Loomis and the local police force. Just like sequels do, it's nothing more than a basic slash n stalk set-up (although director Rick Rosenthal does a slickly well-paced job) with more jarring violence (plenty of blood on this occasion) and nastiness replacing genuine and growing suspense in tight quarters. Even though it's set a secluded, dingy hospital that breathes gloomy unease. However the claustrophobic setting never squeezes the situation all that tight. The plastered shocks are telegraphed, as it has the usual distant background figure (Michael Myers) with his initial victims unaware of his lurking presence. Dean Cundey's fluid camera-work masterfully moves around the screen with atmospheric verve and intent. The framing is spot on. God love those POV shots and the heavy breathing along with it. It looks like there's a little more money behind it and Debra Hill and John Carpenter produced it. Again they also feature as the writers of this entry and while keeping it straight-forward (with some contrived developments) they go on to spend a little more time on Michael Myers' history. Donald Pleasance enthusiastically gives it his all in his bombastic portrayal as Dr. Loomis. I could listen to Pleasance ramble (which does here) on all day about the evil that's Michael Myers. Another treat for the ears was that Carpenter's hauntingly nerve-wreaking score (from the original) is kind of recycled for this outing. The cast for 'Halloween II' is potently strong. Jamie Lee Curtis returns but seems more like a placidly vacant shell of vulnerability, but it's a likable turn and really there's no other Laurie Strode.

Masked killer Michael Myers, however, has not died from his injuries, but is still on the loose and well enough to concentrate on his hobby of slaughtering teenagers. While Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is, along with the town sheriff, desperately looking for Myers on the streets of Heddonfield, our masked Psycho knows exactly where to head... Halloween II confirms what was actually quite clear in the first film - that main protagonist Laurie Strode, who got adopted at an early age, is actually Myers' sister. The film may not quite have the originality of its predecessor, and it certainly isn't a milestone like Halloween was, but, as far as Slasher-sequels go, this is actually top-notch! While there are not too many new ideas, Halloween II successfully keeps up with the quality of the original, and even brings in quite a bit more action. While original Halloween had a story to build up (even if not a very complex one), the sequel has the ability to focus only on killings and suspense throughout. Jamie Lee Curtis is still a doll, and she still plays the leading character of Laurie Strode greatly. The great Donald Pleasence (one of my favorite actors) is once again brilliant in the role of Dr. Sam Loomis (I haven't seen Rob Zombie's Halloween remake so far, and while I'm also a fan of Malcolm McDowell I can hardly imagine anybody but Pleasence to play the role). The brilliant score by the original Halloween-director John Carpenter is still used, but some other music is added. The mood is again creepy, even though the sequel doesn't invest quite as much in atmosphere as the original did. All things considered, this is a surprisingly great sequel. Halloween II is by no means the milestone and classic that Halloween was, but it is still pretty damn creepy and extremely suspenseful. In terms of pure entertainment, this is almost as good as its predecessor. Highly recommended!

It's a shame because there was nothing wrong with the film to begin with. You can sometimes catch the director's cut on T.V. (AMC once in awhile plays it by default). But most of the T.V. prints are just the theatrical version heavily edited.By all means the original cut is far superior to the theatrical release.

By 1981, Hollywood producers had manufactured a fair number of derivative 'slasher' films coasting on the success of Carpenter's film, many of which were a lot more entertaining (Friday the 13th and its sequels are substandard films, but actually more fun to watch). Halloween II, coming on the crest of this wave, picked up where the original left off (with Laurie Strode whisked to the local hospital and Dr. Loomis on the hunt for Michael Myers), but heightened the gore and T&A to the point where it plays more like a rip-off than a sequel (in this case, that's a compliment). Rick Rosenthal (1983's Bad Boys) takes over directorial duties, and does a fair job--he can stage a scene, but only at the expense of narrative continuity (there are few establishing shots in the hospital where a bulk of the film takes place, so it's anyone's guess as to where the action is happening). What the film improves is in putting Michael Myers front and center, instead of relegating him to the shadows--this unsubtle approach works surprisingly well, and Dick Warlock gives 'The Shape' a definite sense of chillingly menacing presence. The performances are what you'd expect--Jamie Lee Curtis' heavily-sedated Laurie makes an effective damsel in peril (a brilliant climactic 'chase' between her and Warlock is an incredibly suspenseful sequence), and Donald Pleasance gives it his all as the hyperventilating Loomis (though his initial hysterical reactions seem very out of character); the supporting cast is introduced for the sole sake of slaughter. For fans of the original, this sequel's marked difference in tone might be a turn-off, but for those looking for an unashamed, unpretentious slasher flick that's as dirtily satisfying as it is scary, give Halloween II a whirl.

It was already perfect!","Date":"29 October 2004","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" I guess I can understand, you have the first sequel to one of the most successful horror movies ever made, maybe using the same music would have come off as trying too hard to cash in on the success of the original. This is, on the other hand, a sequel, and an inherent quality of any sequel is cashing in on the success of the original. It's during the movie itself that it has to earn itself the right to exist, to show that it can stand on its own and not just in the shadow of its predecessor. So Halloween II tries right off the bat to try something new, it just wasn't done right. It's like they had the original simple but effective theme song played on a grand piano and then played the sequel's song on some cheap K-Mart electric piano with some goofy effects added on. Too bad.That being said, at least the rest of the movie was awful. Wait, I shouldn't say that. Not awful, just not good. It wastes not time at all, replaying the very last scene in the original film and then literally picking up the minute the previous film left off, as though the first sequel is not so much a sequel as much as simply a continuation, like Kill Bill. I'm guessing that it was a desired impression that the two movies want to look like one long movie that has been cut into two parts. Dr. Loomis shot Michael Meyers at the end of the previous movie (famously seven times and then runs around yelling about how he shot him six times), pushing him off the second floor balcony with his hail of bullets, then walked to the edge of the balcony and saw that Michael had disappears. The first sequel in the series details the relentless quest to stop Meyers before he can kill again. Needless to say, he wastes no time. Of the three most famous slashers in horror history, Michael Meyers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddy Krueger, Meyers is by far the most relentless. Granted, they're all relentless, but Meyers' tendency to move slowly but deliberately gives me the impression that he is the least stoppable. Krueger can only attack in dreams, and Jason at least takes time to go back to his cabin and regroup, you might say. Get his bearings and plan out his next attack, however much planning he is capable of, anyway. Michael just gets up, and as soon as he has his target in sight he's like the T-1000. He just keeps moving toward his target, falling over when he gets shot a bunch of times and killing the odd teenager unfortunate enough to get in front of him, but never, ever stopping. Once the movie gets going, it's not long before we wind up in a Darkened And Deserted Hospital and the movie devolves into a series of creative death scenes. As you well know, much of the success of horror movies relies on the creativeness and originality of the death scenes. Kill enough people in enough interesting and new ways, and you have a good movie, in general. Halloween II has some creative scenes, but very few that are believable, and the cardinal sin of the creative death scene, many that make you slap your forehead at how stupid people can be.I'll tell you who I have no sympathy for, for example. At one point a hospital orderly named Jimmy comes across a nurse who has an IV needle in her arm, which Michael probably put there since it's just there to allow all the blood to run from her body and onto the floor. So this guy walks into the room, and doesn't notice that she has been bled to death until he kneels beside her and runs his hand along the tube from the needle in her arm to the end dripping all her blood onto the floor, and then he doesn't notice that he has been standing in a huge puddle of blood since the second he walked in the door until he stands up and slips on it, falling over backward and cracking his head on the floor. Let me just tell you this, I'll leave it up to Major Payne to inform him where he can go to look for sympathy. Then he shows up later, dazed and confused, to get into the car in which Laurie is hiding, act all dazed and confused, and then suddenly die.Here's another problem I had with the movie. It makes perfect sense that it takes place in the hospital, since that was where Laurie was taken after her encounter with Michael at the end of the last movie, it's the hospital itself that really bothered me. It is truly a cheap, cheap trick in a horror movie to have something like a dark and deserted hospital, which is something that simply does not exist. No hospital is EVER darkened or deserted as it was in this movie. The lights are never dimmed like that for any reason, at least in the halls, and there are always nurses and orderlies and the occasional doctor wandering the halls and seeing to patients. Hospitals are understandably not the kind of establishments that close for business at the end of the day. I guess I just wish someone could come along and make a good horror movie in a hospital without having to resort to things like no one being around and everything being dark all the time. I have great confidence that it can be done.I think that one of the main reasons that Halloween doesn't work nearly as well as its predecessor, even though it presents itself as merely the second half of it, is because it was guaranteed to be a box office success. The original film was a tremendous smash financially, and the filmmakers knew that just about anything called Halloween II was going to generate a huge amount of interest, so the movie comes off as having been slapped together and cheapened just to get something into the theaters. Michael Meyers was a brooding force in the original film, always near the edge of the screen or just out of sight, never seen very clearly. Now he's front and center and well lit, even in the hospital. We can even see his very eyes, and after Laurie has shot both of them out, if you can believe that. It's like the movie was made just so we could get closer and more personal with Michael Meyers, but that only serves to diminish his image. On the other hand, it's good that they didn't try to keep Meyers in the shadows, or, even worse, try to make him even more of a distant and dark character. Had they done that they might have lost sight of him completely, and as we all know, that kind of thinking will leave you with Halloween III!

It feels like the movie is three hours long. Throw in some really illogical murders, a lot of bad acting, and a very anticlimactic ending and you've got one of the worst slasher movies I've ever sat through. What's amazing is that they only get worse from here. I truly don't understand the appeal of this series. The first one was creepy and well executed. Being written by the creator (John Carpenter), I find it hard to believe this is the best they can do. Our `main' character Laurie Strode is reduced to being bed-ridden most of the film and spurting out a few sentence fragments here and there. The rest of the cast is either under developed or totally unlikeable. There is no one to root for. Instead, we're subjected to Michael Myers murdering arbitrary characters without any suspense. This is where we get introduced to Michael as this killing machine that is `not a man, he's pure evil!' It kind of takes away from the character in my opinion. The first one worked because we didn't know his motive. All we knew was he was some mental patient that was hacking up baby-sitters. That wasn't soooo far fetched. This is where the series really start pushing the limits of reality. Once you do that, you seriously start reducing the level of fear. This is not Aliens or The Thing where it's an alien being whose unknown origin/capabilities are terrifying. This is a serial killer&#133;a slasher. A film that's only scary if it takes place in the world we recognize and live in. Halloween II however, begins the transformation of Michael Myers the cold blooded killer into Michael Myers the cartoon. Not only is this movie not very scary, it's simply not entertaining. It is a chore to sit through. While not my absolute least favorite in the series, it's still way below average.

There are countless reasons not to continue with that same story, and John knew; with the third one, he got to do what he always intended with the series, meaning, a new concept for each one. It only lasted a single one, because audiences wanted Michael, instead. I have to wonder why he behaves so much like a cave-man at points, in this. As well as why the *beautifully* done and immensely effective theme is ruined(did they play it on a synthesizer? What the hell did they do? It sounds awful), why they now use Sandman(hey, I like it, too, but for *this*?), why the subtlety was thrown out the window, and I could go on. I mean, I'm being(trying to be, at least) as forthcoming with this as with any horror movie; this is frankly just not that well-done. MM is shown in a full-body shot near the very beginning, and they assign a POV shot to him, which means that every time the camera moves as if someone is looking, you instantly know where he is and where he's going. That was consistently and intentionally avoided before this one. Can you guess why? It kills the suspense instantly. You'd have to close your eyes during those sequences to not know where he is. This is also noticeably poorly lit, so you can't always tell what is going on, not a problem before in these. There is little to no atmosphere in this, and since it isn't for a lack of trying, I'm chalking it up to Rosenthal not having the skill to pull it off. The cinematography and editing are simply not impressive; even the opening credits are dull, and a waste of a great idea. This doesn't engage at any time. The characters are all either painfully bland or utterly obnoxious(so it's tough to work up sympathy when they die), and that includes Loomis, who went from high-strung to an irritating, bitter and constantly yammering old dude. That's another thing; the acting. It's really bad. You know you're in trouble when Pleasance is over the top. The dialog varies. To an extent, the script feels like one of Carpenter's efforts, if not one of the best; it's the talentless execution that really mars it. Though the effects can be nice enough, a lot of the time, they're merely passable(yes, that is if you take into account when this was made). There is plenty of bloody, gory violence, a bit of disturbing content, infrequent moderate to strong language and relatively brief, gratuitous nudity, both genders. I recommend this solely to those who *need* a second outing. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Unbelievably STUPID...","Date":"9 September 1999","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  I give this movie credit for only one thing as a sequel, it does something that's relatively unique-- it picks up exactly where its predecessor left off. Unfortunately, Halloween II doesn't exactly know where it's going. The first Halloween was obviously great (how many movies can really claim that they single-handedly invented a genre??), but the first of its many sequels REEKS-- not that the other ones have been any better than this.The basic premise here is that Laurie Strode (the fab Jamie Lee Curtis) is the ONLY patient in a hospital whose staff of ~15 nurses inexplicably insists on sneaking off to obscure little rooms of said hospital, so Michael can jab hypodermic syringes into their eyes, or scald them in a hot tub, or completely desanguinate them (drain their blood), etc, etc.  The movie makes it quite clear that Laurie is the only patient in the hospital-- ALL of the other rooms visibly empty-- AND YET THE NURSES STILL HAVE TO WANDER OFF. And no hospital ever keeps its lights turned off. This hospital is very, very DARK, even before the power is cut (or whatever... it doesn't even matter, really)Not that any elements of the Halloween franchise have ever been too firmly grounded in reality (re REAL people die when shot in each eye b/c their brains immediately cease to function...), but Halloween II is even more ludicrous.Rating 2 out of 10.

The result was director Rick Rosenthal complaining Carpenter ruined his film by inserting shots which included a claw hammer breaking open a man's skull or a hypodermic needle being inserted into an eyeball. Those scenes weren't scary. They exist solely to mortify audiences with explicit gore. If Carpenter wanted to produce and write a scary movie he should have. Instead he wrote and produced Halloween II. It's only saving grace is the cast which includes Donald Pleasence as Dr Loomis and Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. But even Laurie Strode is badly written. She's no longer the smart young woman fighting back and has been reduced to a helpless victim frequently crawling and begging for help.

Naturally, the relentless Michael Myers (an effectively eerie pantomime performance by veteran stuntman Dick Warlock) continues to stalk Laurie. Wildly obsessive psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence deliciously hamming it up with his usual rip-snorting brio) comes to the rescue.Director Rick Rosenthal does a capable job of creating a palpably claustrophobic atmosphere, maintains a steady pace throughout, and stages the grisly murder set pieces with nasty aplomb (gory highlights include a couple of throat slashings, a hammer to the head, and a needle through the eye, plus one victim even gets drained of all her blood). A strong bunch of actors and actresses acquit themselves well as the hospital staff, with especially praiseworthy turns by Lance Guest as a nice guy orderly, Leo Rossi as a crass foul-mouthed jerk ambulance driver, the lovely Pamela Susan Shoop as a sweet nurse (Shoop also does a great topless scene), Cliff Emmich as a diligent security guard, and Ford Rainey as a weary old doctor. The hospital setting proves to be suitably remote and stifling; there's a sense of isolation and vulnerability to the place that's genuinely unnerving. But what really makes this movie a sound sequel is the several ways it radically differs from the original the tone is grim and morbid rather than spooky and moody, the violence is more graphic and plentiful, and there's even a chilling explanation provided for Myers' personal vendetta against Laurie (WARNING Possible *SPOILER* ahead. She's his long lost sister, which makes Myers desire to kill her that much more scary and disturbing). The last third of the film makes for a harrowing ordeal and things wrap up on a beautifully haunting closing note (the inspired use of Mr. Sandman helps out a lot here). Dean Cundey's typically polished and agile gliding cinematography rates as another substantial asset. Overall, it's a fine and enjoyable sequel to the superior '78 seasonal slasher classic.

It's not long, of course, before Michael shows up to pay her a visit, scalpel in hand (but no sign of any flowers, choccies, Lucozade, or puzzle book&#x97;the thoughtless git!).With director Rick Rosenthal doing a reasonable job of emulating John Carpenter's visual style (careful use of shadows and shot framing once again creating some wonderfully unsettling moments), Halloween II does manage to deliver some pretty effective scares and nasty kills; but since it was designed primarily to cash in on the mega-success of the original, rather than because a great story was still waiting to be told, the film suffers from a poorly developed script which reduces Laurie to the role of bait, relies a little too much on contrivance (eg. the teenager dressed like Michael, who gets roasted, leading the police to believe the killer is dead), and is eventually forced to throw in a crazy motive for Michael to continue his pursuit of poor old Laurie&#x97;she is his baby sister.Oh well, at least the film does the decent thing and features quite a few killings (the total body-count is 13, which includes several stabbings, a hypodermic needle in the eye, a hammer in the head, and a fatal scalding), plus there is some much appreciated female nudity courtesy of jugtastic nurse Karen (Pamela Susan Shoop), who strips off for some sexy time in a hydro therapy pool.

This sequel, however, is definitely the best of the bunch and I would even go as far as to say that I like part 2 slightly more than the original film. The original bored me because a lot of the running time was spent on building the story (which was neither interesting nor original) and Michael Myers 'stalking' people. This time, we get thrust straight into the film - and although it still isn't that great, at least most of the running time isn't spent waiting around. This film's major talking point is the fact that the story takes place immediately after the events of the first film. Most sequels pick up some time later, but the fact that this one picks up where we left off is good because it allows the audience to get straight back into it, and is also slightly fascinating in a what happens next kind of a way. As you might expect, the story is wafer thin and it follows boring serial killer Michael as he slashes his way through town in search of Lawrie Strode, from the first film.John Carpenter didn't direct this film, and that can only be a good thing. Rick Rosenthal steps into his shoes and creates the same atmosphere as the first film, only without the egotistical score soaking that John Carpenter does with all of his films. Jamie Lee Curtis steps back into her role from the original and is given practically nothing to do once again. It's really hard to care for the victim when they have no character at all - no wonder Myers wanted rid of her! Also reprising his role as Myers' doctor and biggest fan is Donald Pleasance, and like he would go on to do in 'The Return of Michael Myers', spends a lot of the running time bigging up his dull mental patient. Of the big three slasher series', Halloween is definitely the worst and a lot of the reason for that is because of the serial killer. Some people think that the emotionless way that Michael stalks his victims is frightening, but I only found it boring. Myers represents a distinct lack of imagination on the parts of writers John Carpenter and Debra Hill, and I won't be joining in on the pretence that he's anything but dull. On the whole, if you like the first one; you'll like this. If you didn't, there's no point in seeing any of the sequels.

Fact simply remains that this is a more than worthy sequel, that above all things is a great movie within its genre.The first Halloween from 1978 sort of formed and established the modern slasher-genre. This movie expands this even more by featuring some of the more commonly known modern slasher elements in it. Bascily it's a movie about a killer maniac who is on a killing spree, set for most part in an hospital this time. You can say that this movie is less horror than Halloween was but is more slasher-like.What I also love about this movie is that it right sets off after the events of the first movie. Movies often attempt this but it doesn't always work out that well, due to a difference in approach and atmosphere for instance. Halloween II perfectly blends in with its predecessor and it's made believable that the evens in this movie all take place during the same night as the events the first one, even though the movie got made 3 years later.Because it takes place during the same night, it also means that the surviving characters from the first movie make their appearance once more in this one, though for some reason Jamie Lee Curtis' character is pushed to the background a bit due to the fact that also new characters get introduced and Donald Pleasance's his role is also bigger this time.As a genre movie it simply is a great and effective one. It has some nice moments in it that make the genre so great and always effective to watch, when done right. There are some nice gory moments as well, which were apparently added by John Carpenter himself, after the original shot version got considered to 'tame' by him.

He's also given a stupid back story which wasn't needed.There are huge script problems too--Myers breaks into a school (why?) and prints Samhain (an ancient Druid saying) on a blackboard--how is a homicidal maniac going to even KNOW what Samhain is? Curtis is comatose and near death at one point but she's next seen stumbling around the hospital. The front door of the hospital is unlocked but mysteriously becomes locked when Curtis is trying to enter. Also this is the darkest and most unpopulated hospital I've ever seen.Acting varies--poor Curtis has to act drugged up the entire film and Pleasence is lousy (but the dialogue he's given is pretty bad). On the plus side it IS well directed by Rick Rosenthal effectively using the wide screen (try to see it letter-boxed). Rosenthal was criticized for all the explicit violence in the film but he said John Carpenter (who produced the film) shot all the gore inserts. It was never really resolved.So there are tons of things wrong with this film--so why am I giving it a 7? It moves quickly, is well-directed and throws a gory death at you every 7 minutes or so--you're never bored. So if you turn off your mind COMPLETELY this is lots of fun.

No wonder the sequel can't live up to that. The surprise element is gone, the atmosphere is a bit ruined and Michael doesn't look that scary anymore. There is less use of the chilling music ( by Carpenter himself) which increases the bore-aspect as well.  Although the original only had 4 or 5 killings ( while Halloween II has 11 or 12), this episode is a lot less creepy.

We pick up just before the original Halloween (1978) left off and after a short recap we are into the main title credit sequence, it features the cool Halloween theme (by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth) with a pumpkin in the left hand side of the screen. As the credits roll it gets bigger and bigger, eventually splitting open and revealing a skull inside. I must admit I thought this opening credit sequence is cool, not enough thought goes into them usually. Anyway, on with the film. Micheal Myers (Dick Warlock) was not killed when Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) shot him six times in the chest. Myers wanders the neighbourhood, he steals a knife from a Mrs. Elrod's (Lucille Benson) kitchen. He kills a young girl named Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes as Nancy Loomis) who happens to be the daughter of the local Sheriff, Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers). Along with Dr. Loomis, Deputy Gary Hunt (Hunter Von Leer) is now even more determined to capture Myers. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the survivor from the original Halloween, is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to receive treatment. A masked man is knocked down and killed in Haddonfield, the authorities think it may be Myers and await dental conformation as the body is badly burnt. This gives the real Myers a chance to slip through the relaxed police presence and go after Laurie. Laurie has been seen by Dr. Frederick Mixter (Ford Rainey) and is placed on the ward under the supervision of head nurse Mrs. Alves (Gloria Gifford) and her nurses, Jill Franco (Tawny Moyer), Janet Marshall (Ana Alicia) and Karen Bailey (Pamela Susan Shoop). One of the paramedics who brought Laurie in, Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) recognises her from school and decides to stay with her, his mate Budd (Leo Rossi) instead decides to try and have sex with the nurses, I'm with Budd on this one! Mrs. Alves discovers that the phones aren't working and sends the security guard Mr. Garrett (Cliff 'Fatty' Emmich) to have a look. Myers puts an axe in his head and sets about finding and killing Laurie, and anyone who gets in his way! Meanwhile it turns out that the dead body belonged to a teenage kid named Bennett Tramer (Jack Verbois) and that Myers is still on the loose. After a fellow Doctor, Marion Chambers lets lip some restricted information about Laurie and Micheal, Loomis realises that all Myers wants to do is kill Laurie and sets off for the hospital. But will he be too late? Directed by Rick Rosenthal I quite liked this. The script by John Carpenter and Debra Hill is a little clichéd and routine, but it does what it does rather well. It has a fair body count and some decent gore and good special effects, a hypodermic needle in an eye, someone drowned in scalding hot water, an axe in a head, a burnt corpse, stabbings and a slit throat. It moves along at a fair pace and I really liked the way it picked up from the original and continued straight on with the story, in fact you could probably edit both of them together and get one long film. Acting is OK, but Jamie Lee Curtis seems underused especially during the first hour when she's just a patient in a hospital bed doing nothing in particular. Pleasence seemed to ramble on a little too much as well. Technically the film is solid, music, editing, sets and photography. But why set it in the darkest and most underpopulated hospital on Earth?! Why only three nurses for the entire hospital, I've heard of staff shortages but this is ridiculous! Why, apart from the little girl at the start with a razor blade in her lip, are there no other patients? I thought this was a good continuation of the Halloween story and a worthy sequel, worth a watch for horror fans although casual viewers may find it a little dark and silly at times. Decent enough. "},{"Title":"Good Sequel","Date":"2 December 2008","Score":"2 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Halloween 2 (1981) *** (out of 4) Pretty good sequel picks up right after the events in the first film, which is a fairly rare thing. This time Myers is still stalking Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) and we find out it's because she's his sister. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is still in town trying to track down the masked killer. This is certainly a good follow up, written by Carpenter, but I don't quite enjoy it as much as I use to. I know a lot of the original reviews bashed the movie for adding gore after the success of Friday the 13th and I understand why some might be upset at this but the kill sequences here are done very well and are pretty creative. The biggest problem I have with the film is a logic problem, which bothers me since I worked in a hospital. There's just no way anything that happens inside the hospital is possible. Why isn't there any other patients? Why aren't the police every protecting Laurie? I'm sure most people won't be troubled by those logic things and perhaps I should turn my brain off but they still bother me. The film features some nice cinematography that makes this stand out compared to various slasher of the day. Curtis and Pleasence are also very good in their roles with both adding a lot to their characters. The final chase sequence offers some good tension as well. "}]
