[{"Title":"The greatest movie by one of the great filmmakers of all time","Date":"21 December 2004","Score":"120 out of 149 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Ed Wood was one of the greatest moviemakers in film history. Could he direct? Not really. Were his movies technical masterpieces? Could his actors act? Did he have huge budgets? No. We're here fifty years later, talking about him, because he created worlds on film nobody had ever seen before or since. His characters talked like nobody we've ever heard before (though there are strong echoes in the works of Hartley and Lynch). And unlike every Hollywood movie ever made, Ed ripped open his heart and poured it out on the screen. Never more so than in Glen Or Glenda, his original avant-garde masterpiece.Avant-garde? You heard me. What is the definition of avant-garde film? Some attributes are unconventional narrative, unique visual style, radical rejection of artistic or social norms, an often willful disregard for reality. Gloria Floren said Avant-garde films are often iconoclastic, mocking conventional morality and traditional values; the filmmaker's intense interest in eccentricities and extremes may shock viewers.Â  Indeed, the avant-garde film maker's purpose may be to wake or shake up the audience from the stupor of ordinary consciousness or the doldrums of conventional perspective.Imagine if people viewed Un Chien Andalou or Meshes Of The Afternoon or Eraserhead with fratboy derision instead of holy reverence. They'd be viewed as unwatchable nonsense too. Everybody'd have a good snark watching for continuity errors and bad camera moves. Does Glen or Glenda rise to the level of those classics? Time will tell, but try this experiment watch it as if it were, and see. The results may surprise you.Here are some hints. Lugosi is not a mad scientist--he's God, looking down upon twisted human morality and pulling the strings. The green eyed monster that eats little boys? Envy. Envy of women and in this case, their clothes. That envy has eaten vast amounts of Glen's life, it's been a torture to him. There are numerous references to that torture and misery. There's also an entire section devoted to judgment--human judgment versus that reserved to God. The nonsensical stock footage of buffaloes and the army? It signifies the rush of adrenaline, fear and anxiety as Glen tries to confront his identity and come out to his girlfriend. Far from random, it's actually used with ingenuity and skill. The symbology of scenes in which Glen battles his female self and resists the devil should be obvious. But then again, a generous viewing of Glen or Glenda, rather than a beer-fueled let's watch a crap movie viewing, would reveal a great deal. Even the campy scene at the end, when Dolores Fuller relents and gives Glen her sweater, comes with the always-missed segment where God absolves Glen of his misery. There are a dozen moments like this. Sure, there are a dozen technical flubs and random nonsense too, but all good art is organic. There's a guy wearing a Timex in Ben-Hur, for god's sake.The narrator seems comical and dated to us, but in 1953 he was standard-issue, and the lines we now take as campy were then revolutionary, almost treasonous. A plea for tolerance for sexual and gender differences? Condemning the police for arresting gays and transvestites just for existing? During the McCarthy era, when all homosexuals were presumed to be communists? A film like that is bound to make some enemies. Especially a film that featured, not actors playing deviants, but the deviants themselves, in their own words. It's telling that the extreme-religious-conservative Medved brothers were the ones who named Ed Wood worst director of all time. They must have thought they were really sticking it to Ed Wood for making all those subversively weird films involving crossdressing and homosexuals and society's outcasts. Thankfully, irony remains the most powerful force in the universe, and their mean-spirited declaration made Ed Wood a household name. Whether they admit it or not, a lot of this movie's detractors are laughing at the subject, not the movie. Many others are baffled by the unconventional narrative. Just because you don't get something, doesn't mean there is nothing to get.It's easy to give any movie the MST3K treatment, especially ones that veer into uncomfortable or seemingly absurd territory. If you're looking for the worst movie ever made, go watch Armageddon or Crossroads. If you're looking for THE pioneering moment in GLBT film history, the greatest and most underrated American DIY avante-garde feature of its time, or an experience that just might change the way you view movies and the world at large, start right here.

Suffice it to say, one has to witness it in order to really believe it. There's almost no point of writing a sensible review of this movie because it's beyond wonky. It's so bad that it's almost pure genius. Bunuel couldn't have created a more surreal film than Ed Wood's treatise on the merits of cross-dressing. The movie is 70% stock footage or stuff that has nothing to do with the main story. A huge chunk of the amazing dream sequence is just a nudie cutie. The acting is abysmal. Dolores Fuller wins the award for worst actress of all time. The dialogue is so hilarious that it's endlessly quotable. But the whole thing is oddly frank and earnest and because of this, this kooky disaster of a movie actually has a heart, which is more than you can say about most movies out there. I love it. There's almost nothing like it.

The so-called worst director of all time. Sorry, there are plenty of other directors who could take that title because Ed Wood is not that bad of a director nor a bad person. Ed made movies to make movies, not to make a buck. And that's why his films are sort of poignant in their flaws.Glen or Glenda? is a statement, not a film. It is a statement about transvestism, the truth behind it, and gives several (for the most part, factual) cases of transvestites and transsexuals. Wood is world-reknowned for being a transvestite with a fetish for angora sweaters. And here, he is brave enough to cast himself in an autobiographical role (Glen) and let the world know (yet, he hides under the pseudonym of Daniel Davis).Glen or Glenda? is a bad movie lover's dream. Hilarious dialogue, no coherent plotline, and many memorable sequences of transvestites and their hardships. The narrator does a splendid job of camping things up while explaining how a transvestite is not a homosexual, how it is more healthy to wear womens' clothing, and the tragic results of misunderstood transvestites. Plus, you get Bela Lugosi as God (he's nice and campy), several out-of-place striptease and cheesecake scenes (pretty graphic for 1953), and Dolores Fuller (Wood's real-life girlfriend) as Glen's fiancee.Too many people rated this movie with a 1. But Glen or Glenda? is not as bad as Orgy of the Dead or other later Ed Wood classics. In fact, Glen or Glenda? is arguably Wood's greatest achievement. Check it out, I strongly recommend it.

Also, I bought all of the films that he had made that I could get my hands on.Like it or not, Glen Or Glenda was a landmark film!This particular film was made WAY AHEAD of it's time!! While I was first watching Tim Burton's fantastic film, recreating the making of Glen Or Glenda, I noticed that there were things in it that seemed rather familiar to me, even after 30+ years have passed, and that is what partly interested me in looking into both the book, and Ed Wood's films. What I discovered was, I had seen this film when I was in GRADE SCHOOL!!After viewing the REAL Glen OR Glenda film, I realized that I had had seen this exact same film before, although heavily edited!It was shown as a part of our sex-ed class!! I can hardly believe it that they showed us this back then, but they did. Nothanks to the school I went to, and the horribly incompetent teachers, but they did show it!Now, fast forward to today, the reason for all of the extra scenes near the end of the film, such as the 'Devil' sequences, and the rest of the rather abstract looking scenes, were not originally part of the screenplay. Those scenes (baffling and dumbfounding), were NOT part of the film as Ed had written. His script left the running time short of what George Weiss had told him he wanted, a 7 reel, 16MM film, which was what he needed to sell it. A 16MM reel runs about 10 minutes, and George needed a 70 minute film (at least), because he pre-sold it in several states as a Feature, before he actually found out what it really was. He wasn't too pleased with what Ed had made, but he was able to distribute it to his clients, after all of the extraneous material was added at the end. George did eventually make his money back, and he and Ed worked on a couple of other projects, unlike what is shown in the Ed Wood film.Even today, though, I think that this film was made way before it's time, and Ed Wood should deserve some credit for trying to bring a sense of understanding to what was then a totally misunderstood way of life for a select few.

His films, bad as they are, have a definite style all their own. While I was watching Glen Or Glenda, I was consumed with how jaw-droppingly bad the movie was. The funny thing is, I was also entertained by it, and so was everyone else in the theater when I saw it (yes, I caught this movie on the big screen at a revival).I started thinking about how Ed Wood so desperately wanted to make a movie that he fashioned this film out of anything he could, stretching the script far beyond its own capacity and inserting bizarre fantasy sequences to pad out the running time, which would have been about 20 minutes tops had he cut the crap.Basically the film is an autobiographical plea for acceptance of transvestism, with Wood himself in the starring role. There is no real story, but rather a series of vignettes in which Wood appears in and out of drag, comes clean to his girlfriend about why her angora sweaters are all stretched out. In seemingly unrelated footage, Bela Lugosi camps it up on a haunted house set, and I'm fairly certain he's supposed to be playing God. Wow. There are no words for what a mess the movie turned out to be...so much so that it becomes fascinating. In my opinion, the worst crime a movie can commit is being completely boring, and in that regard Glen or Glenda is not guilty. Incompetent on every other level imaginable, the film truly must be seen to be believed. "},{"Title":"Believe the hype! Everything you've heard about this one is true!

Wood's reputation as the worst director ever pushes some buffs buttons as it marginalizes already marginalized film makers like Ray Dennis Steckler, Ted V. Mikels, Herschell Gordon Lewis, Al Adamson and other so bad it's good directors. I leave more knowledgeable fans than me to argue over who REALLY is the worst, but there's no denying that Wood's movies are quite unlike anything made before or since. 'Glen Or Glenda' is his best movie, or if the term best misleads, his Ed Woodest. I've lost track of how many times I've seen it over the years but it never loses its power to amuse and astound. Every single time I watch it I am flabbergasted! It literally has to be seen to be believed. Wood plays the title character, a man wrestling with his transvestitism. His girlfriend is played by Dolores Fuller, the cop by Lyle Talbot, the psychiatrist by Timothy Farrell, all three familiar faces from other Wood classics like 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' and 'Jail Bait'. But the real reason to watch this is the utterly bizarre performance from horror legend Bela Lugosi, credited on the version I watched as scientist, and on the IMDb as The Spirit, who may or may not be God. His rantings of Pull the strings! Pull the strings! and nonsensical stuff about Green dragons and puppy dog tails will stay in your head for YEARS, if not for the rest of your life! Wood intercuts this with nutty stock footage like buffalo stampedes, and one of the most wacked out nightmare sequences ever seen, which includes lots of chubby gals in states of undress, some S and M, and and an appearance by Satan. Believe the hype - everything you've heard about this one is true! Fifty years on it's STILL one of the weirdest movies ever made.

Look Deeper.","Date":"1 April 2006","Score":"31 out of 39 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The 1950s a rigid and conforming time period in American history, a time when homophobia ran rampant and diverse lifestyles simply were not tolerated or glorified, came the 1953 transvestite drama 'Glen or Glenda'. 'Glen or Glenda' was Edward D. Wood's feature-length directorial debut and is considered by many to be one of the most obscure films of all time. Ed Wood's first big picture was quite a special one for him, the main reason being that it told a story very dear to him. Ed Wood was in many senses, the character of Glen/Glenda. The fact is, Ed Wood did find comfort in women's clothing and he did favor angora sweaters to the traditional shirt and tie which defined the era. These factors contribute to the film making, the effort, and ultimately the passion behind the film. Ed Wood was making a picture with a subject matter very dear to him and it comes through in this fine piece of work. Glen or Glenda is now considered to be a cult classic, but at the time it explored previously uncharted territory (not that this was a smash-hit when it came out in 1953 either). However, this is certainly not to say that the film is irrelevant to today's social standards, regulations, and expectations, on the contrary it proves to be quite pertinent to life in the 21st century.'Glen or Glenda' opens with a character simply cast as 'Scientist' (Bela Lugosi) prophetically speaking of the society in which we live and its and loathing of the seemingly abnormal or unknown. He speaks of society's outcasts, the troubled world in which they live, and the problems they face in their day to day lives. The story ensues as the police arrive at the scene of a recent suicide. The victim was a well-known transvestite, cast out by society and all others around him. Among the police is Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot). Troubled by this seemingly strange case, he seeks help in Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell), a respected psychoanalysis who has encountered various transvestites in his line of work. He begins to tell Inspector Warren of a patient he once dealt with named Glen. Glen was engaged to be married to Barbara (Dolores Fuller), but had been hiding a dark secret from his fiancÃ©e; Glen (or Glenda?) was secretly a transvestite. Alton continues to tell Inspector Warren of the internal struggle within Glen whether to tell Barbara of his secret lifestyle or to keep it to himself&#133; or to entirely stop wearing the clothes which make him feel so much like himself?Although the subject matter, upon first glance, may seem to some a tongue in cheek jab at the transvestites and other oddballs of the world, it was not intended that way - nor does it come across as such after viewing the film. 'Glen or Glenda' is a startlingly solid effort at a fresh (and controversial) subject of the 1950s. Not only was the film fresh and innovative, but it prospered on a technical level as well. With excellent cinematography and pristine, appropriate lighting, the film is technically quite good. Dolores Fuller's acting is well-below average, but the other characters offer decent performances (Ed Wood's acting is curiously above average (seeing how he had little to no professional acting experience). Bela Lugosi's performance is, as always, a strong one with memorable dialogue. Although Lugosi is technically listed as a 'Scientist' in the film, symbolically he represents God. He is the one who pulls the strings; he is the one who has become filled with contempt for the human race and its judgmental nature. The symbolism within 'Glen or Glenda' is often overlooked and classified as inept dialogue, but to an acute observer, it is astoundingly developed. The green-eyed monster, mentioned by Bela Lugosi's character, can be interpreted as Glen's envy of women and their clothing. The seemingly random stock footage of the Buffalo represents the rush that Glen feels when symbolically transformed into Glenda. When realized, 'Glen or Glenda' is full of metaphoric meaning and symbolism, as well as a fresh plot, rife with unique social commentary. 'Glen or Glenda' is a film which does not dance around the subject matter. It recognizes an important (at least to director Ed Wood) and controversial social issue and discusses it in full, leaving nothing left unspoken. The film proves itself to be enjoyable and entertaining to watch throughout, with some memorable performances (for better or for worse...) and an interesting plot. With such originality and such passion, Glen or Glenda is a film which should be respected and treasured, rather than criticized for its below-average acting, seemingly strange dialogue, and obscure premise, for its pure outspoken zealousness in the 1950s, a period when transvestism and homosexuality were blatantly not openly accepted. Is this to say that these lifestyles are accepted today? Shall we consult Pat Robertson or perhaps George W. Bush on this matter? The film is just as relevant today as it was in 1953 when it was first released. Glen or Glenda proves to be entertaining and intriguing, full of obscure characters and a fresh subject matter a film far ahead of it's time.

If one does so, the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious, convoluted dialog, the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values. Yet, such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds. It isn't the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. It's not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relic.No, what makes Glen or Glenda? still a fascinating film after 50 years is that Ed Wood laid his psyche bare in a way that so-called auteur directors like Hitchcock or Godard, despite their vastly superior talents, never did. In Glen or Glenda, Wood isn't afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film. Indeed, the conclusion of the film suggest that Ed Wood's Glen character will be able to kill his Glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection Glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife, Barbara. The psychiatrist even reassures Glen and Barbara that as Glen makes that psychic transference, Glenda will disappear. So, while Wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general, he wasn't so sure of desiring it for himself.Moreover, Wood wasn't afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen. He did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on. If it didn't cohere, so what? What the viewer saw in Glen or Glenda especially was Ed Wood's imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangeness.The only comment I wish to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph. The oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities I don't think can be rated.

I also liked the soft porn with the squirming girls in semi-undress. But I'm still wondering how that got released in 1953. Then there's Lugosi sitting in some corner of the surrealist universe, telling us to Bevare of puppy dog tails&#x85; and other hammy nonsense. I figure he was added for marquee value since the rest of the cast are a bunch of unknowns. But what's this thing Wood has for lightning bolts.

Ed Wood's infamy in the film world leads to a particular form of expectation in cult circuits that sometimes gives prejudice in places where it's not due (though I'm not going to argue that Plan 9 from Outer Space isn't terrible... I'll write a review of that one next), but I think Glen or Glenda? shows that there may be a lot from Wood we're taking for granted.Not to say this is a good, or even great, film by any means. It's real problem lies in the fact that despite Ed Wood's own well-noted transvestitism, this movie was made in a time when such issues were taboo enough to be misunderstood even by those who suffered from it. Glen or Glenda? is Ed Wood's personal journey into his own double-life, which involves, among other things, questioning woman's role in society, gender politics, and psychoanalysis. The absurd and random cutting through different viewpoints, narratives, and devices actually work FOR Wood's own confusion... the movie itself is as schizophrenic as people's opinions about the subject the movie is portraying.The second real reason why Glen or Glenda? fails simply has to do with the horror genre itself. Wood uses horror tropes to express himself, when this movie would be a lot more successful as a drama with most of the same dialog... though nothing changes the fact that the dialog could have been delivered much better. Bela Lugosi's role especially stands out in stark contrast to the rest of the film, which at times goes through documentary or cinema verite-like, melodramatic, war, and psychoanalytical concepts at a dizzying pace. Actually, as I see it, Lugosi's character is comparable to The Man in the Planet from Eraserhead or the Emcee from Cabaret, a separate, somewhat metaphysical entity that comments in its own way upon the more diegetic elements of the rest of the film.Otherwise, despite a very vague sense of misogyny, Glen or Glenda? is remarkably successful at detailing the anxiety and confusion felt by transvestites of various personalities. It's not-so-subtle arguments for transvestism are laughable, but they're more reasonable than I think many people are willing to admit. Had this movie been done by more capable hands, it could have become an immensely important document, but on another level Wood's own campy quality reflects the sort of underground sentiment and misassociation inherent in its own subject matter.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"David Lynch eat  your heart out, a strange masterpiece","Date":"29 September 2005","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Ed Wood's one genuine masterpiece, not to take anything away from the so bad it's good category most of the rest of his films fall into, but this film genuinely expresses Wood's life with him playing himself.

Wood, Jr. talked an exploitation movie producer into hiring him to direct what was initially meant to be the story of Christine Jorgenson, the first (and heavily publicized) case of surgically induced transexualism; this project was alternately to be called The Christine Jorgenson Story, and later (after Jorgenson changed her mind), I Changed My Sex. Of course, after Ed Wood got his hands on the basic storyline, he altered it so as to tell the story of his own transvestitism and to plead for greater tolerance and understanding; set against the staid morals of the early 1950s, Ed's pleading was actually ahead of its time.Now, in wanting to tell this story, but in being constrained by both a shoestring budget and some rather bizarrely unusual filmaking instincts, Ed's efforts went sharply astray. This is, without question, one of the loopiest productions ever put on celluloid, chock full of nonsensical dialogue, amateurishly wooden acting (in fact, Ed's hammy attempt at acting was something out of a 1930s B movie), illogically inserted stock footage (gotta love the stampeding buffalo), and various leaps of logic and good taste. In spite, or perhaps because, of these elements, GLEN OR GLENDA is a thoroughly entertaining and endearing piece of high weirdness. The first time you see it, you won't believe what you are seeing.Long live the Ed Wood cult! Pull the strings!

By saying they're bad automatically I'm not being facetious Wood's movies are to independent cinema what John Cassavetes was in his own right to the same movement. They made their marks and have been noted in history as the grandfathers of their particular mold. Whereas Cassavetes was a master at relationships and probing the mind and heart and soul of people, Wood was... not exactly. And yet there's no denying that he was original - just not entirely talented.Certainly as a screenwriter he had all of the trademarks of someone who shouldn't try and write - forced exposition, crummy bits of polemic stuff, no real ear for dialog short of one-dimensional molds - and yet at the same time there's moments in Glen or Glenda, perhaps unintentionally, that appear brilliant. The Beware speech, repeated a few times, first by Scientist Bela Lugosi, who was put in the film just for the purpose of having a mad scientist who is, maybe, like a God or something in this world, is howlingly funny, certainly more inspired than any of the banter between the policeman and the psychologist.And yet... I couldn't tear myself away from the screen, and unlike another Wood stinker such as The Sinister Urge I didn't really need the Mystery Science Theater guys as back-up. There's a perverse energy to the picture, something weird and eerie and dark and brooding and all of those things that should make art. Maybe it is; there's a mid-section in the picture, when Wood splices in random footage of tying up a woman to a couch and other things involving females undressing (with Lugosi and Wood himself spliced in to ogle), that displays a filmmaker who has something going on, something direct and primal to his audience. I almost wished that the movie were better because of it, as though there's the surface of a surreal masterwork that can never be scratched deeply enough before the movie returns to its crap-informational diatribes about transvestites and hermaphrodites.It's neither a disappointment or something I'd really recommend - unless to those friends of mine wondering why an Ed Wood movie is listed as one of David Lynch's favorites. Not surprising, it has 50s sex and desire and nightmare all over it. It's like a student who writes a C+ paper that can never be improved, at all, and it's the best we'll get, yet there are those kernels that keep it from failure.

Wood Jr's first attempt at directing a feature film. For this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart...transvestism, the art of a man wanting to dress in women's clothes. To his credit, Wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately, Wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film.The story opens with a prologue by Bela Lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite Glen/Glenda (Daniel Davis aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) tries to understand why a man would want to live (and die) this way.Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores Fuller) and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession. And that's it. We see endless stock footage shots of anything from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with shots of Wood walking down the same street dressed as either Glen or Glenda and looking longingly at women's clothes in a store window. Poor old Bela, who was down on his luck and befriended by Wood, keeps popping in throughout the story. I'm not 100% sure but I think Bela's scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completed.To add to the confusion of Lugosi's narration, Farrell as Dr. Alton also provides off screen narration. Lugosi keeps saying, bevare, bevare...take care, take care, as well as, some gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy dog's tails.The story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and Wood's character(s). The dream sequences are laughable. A wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example. Wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors(?) fully clothed but leaving little to the imagination, risquÃ© for 1953.This film along with Wood's other classics were so bad that they became embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. For that reason, they have survived to this day.

But it was surprisingly good. It is different from Ed Wood's other work such as Bride of the Atom, Plan 9 from Outer Space, Night of the Ghouls. There are no mistakes or bad dialogue. The story line is somewhat interesting. A man torn between love and transvestitism. Ed stars in this, but does not give a bad performance. He acts very believable. That's the way I think an actor should act. Dolores Fuller isn't as believable, but still manages to act out some good scenes with Ed. This movie most definitely did not deserve the beating it got during its release. Warren Beatty was able to see what an overlooked movie it was and convinced Paramount to re-release it. That is until the George Weiss estate bought the rights back. Bela Lugosi is good in his minor, but pleasing role. I think this whole movie is very interesting and fun. But there is this particular scene of girls stripping every few seconds and Bela Lugosi looking at them. I think that is one scene that went on for just too long. I wasn't too fond of the last half. The character Glen's situation was watchable and good enough to keep watching, but when you get to a character named Alan in the end it just got dragged on.But I still do highly recommend this.

When describing I Changed My Sex, or Glen Or Glenda as it is better known, I must echo the thoughts of Andrew Smith, who so hit the nail on the head when he wrote If you haven't seen any of Ed Wood's other movies, this one is a completely bewildering experience. If you have seen any of Ed Wood's movies, this is still completely bewildering. The film is both hilarious and tragic, yet it moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves one in no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during its running length. Wood, bless him, had some of the loftiest ambitions as a director, wanting to promote peace, understanding, and even acceptance, in the 1950s of all times. When Tim Burton recreated a viewing of Glen Or Glenda by studio execs for his biopic, he showed the execs laughing and telling each other that this had to be a put-on. More than fifty years later, there are still people fighting just to be given the kind of respect that the normal take for granted, so I say it most certainly is not.No, the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the sheer ineptitude Wood displays in composing his message. Directors frequently use stock footage when they can find some that suits their purposes, and can be edited to fit with their own footage. Ed Wood used stock footage indiscriminately, and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood as played by Johnny Depp bets that he could make an entire film out of stock footage. Sadly, the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen Or Glenda is the closest he ever came. The IMDb states that twenty percent of this sixty-something minute film is stock footage, and it is never difficult to guess which footage. Footage of busy highways, planes flying overhead, poor lightning effects, soldiers doing their thing, they're all used in a haphazard manner, sometimes repeatedly, and they often only have a loose connection to the story Wood is trying to tell. Had Wood been able to sit back and think about what he is trying to do for a while, there is no telling what kind of heights he could have achieved.Wood himself appears in the film as the titular character, a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named Glenda. Aside from the daring manner in which he attempts to make his point, Wood makes one hideous woman. Having found myself out on the fringe of a society that thinks I am disabled and need to be cured myself, I honestly found myself hoping for the best outcome for Wood's character. In order to make his point, however, Wood weaves in short stories of two other transvestites. One of them takes the extreme step of enduring a sex change in order to become a woman, the other finds himself so disenfranchised that he fears being arrested again so much he commits suicide. The scary thing about this film is that if you edited out the transvestism and substituted such disenfranchisements as my position on the autistic spectrum or such things as schizophrenia, very little of the film would even need to be changed. That is how little society has learned since Ed Wood was a boy.The other significant personality in Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, whom Wood shoehorned into the film. Speculation varies upon Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career, and would do anything in order to achieve this. With the exception of taking his time to carefully construct a good film, that is. In Glen Or Glenda, Wood makes usage of Lugosi that was best described in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood as bizarre. Lugosi plays a character billed as The Scientist, but comes off more as an omnipotent puppet master. People who have not seen Ed Wood films before the biopic will think Tim Burton made up the beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep speech. If anything, Burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in depicting Wood-ian dialogue. Nothing can prepare you for seeing the speeches in their original context, not even Criswell's hilarious ranting during Plan 9 From Outer Space.Observant types will also note the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at the time. Again, Burton dramatises her reaction to seeing the script for the first time, whereas the film portrays her as being accepting and forward-thinking. I cannot help but feel that Burton's portrayal is more accurate, as Fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in her role. She only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her cast-mates, if such a thing is possible. Whether Wood's direction was better-focused in this case than usual is hard to determine, but if the ability of the support cast to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the dust is any guide, then it should come as no surprise that Fuller would only appear in a very small role within one other Wood film. That she went on to write a number of hit songs tells you she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood would appear before the camera again, it was never as more than a cameo, a walk-on, or a bit-part.I gave Glen Or Glenda a one out of ten. I generally only give this rating to films that are so bad they become entertaining as a result. Bold and well-intentioned as it was, Glen Or Glenda fits that description to a T.

Jail Bait shows him for example as an quite ambitious director (a movie which isn't so much fun, but still not really good in a common way) or films which are just different then others and in that case also not so funny. Glen or Glenda is one of this films of the last mentioned category.Glen or Glenda is a very personal work of the director. the topic is transvestism / cross- dressing and the pressure the society puts on such persons. There are 2 frame-plots, 2 main-plots and 1 quite long dream-like sequence. All of this is packed in a playtime of around 1 hour. So you can understand you will not get a really elaborated story, cause there is no time for that.this film is not so much a feature film, it is more an educational one. A education film which intention is to change the society's opinion, enlighten about this not so well known subject, all done in a pseudo-documentary style.The off-voice is bringing forward some arguments, while the pictures are just underlining them. the actors are just visual representations/examples and like in all educational films they are playing quite bad, though not 'funny' bad. One important role has the doctor, who represents the professional, the specialist, which the people should believe.The problem of the whole movie is, that Woods line of arguments is incoherent first he is against a biologism, than he advances a view in which transvestism is something natural (biologism) and then it is just an illness (plot with the doctor). Ed Wood by himself doesn't know how to argue and how to win the tolerance of the viewer, so he tries it in different ways.The first main-plot is presented still in this educational style and one man's transvestism is shown as an example. The pressure which is put on the protagonist is shown in a dream-like sequence, which reminds on silent-movie-era. In this part there is also shown some S&M (but VERY soft, without naked bodies and just symbolic), though it has nothing to do with the topic. This sequence leaves the educational style and invites the viewer to interpret the film in a more free way.At the end of the film there are 15 mins left for the 2nd main-plot, in which he shows a second example of a cross-dresser. the subjects in this part are sex reversal and hermaphrodtism, a topic which is till nowadays not well known.the movie is not good and it is also not bad, it is not funny either and it is not a feature film. it is an educational one with pseudo-documentarian methods. It is an advocacy for more tolerance in our society. Though Woods opinion is not up-to-date anymore, though it is not well argued, this film is a quite interesting historical document about the debate. Who thinks this is a funny, entertaining or even a horror-film goes totally wrong and misunderstands this film.

Watching both movies in one day made Glen or Glenda look good by comparison, but it is, by itself, one of the most bewildering movies I've seen.I say this not because of its pleas for tolerance in gender matters. That might have seemed odder in the '50s, when homophobia was more mainstream. We've since moved on to debating whether gays can marry. What's really striking about this movie, rather, is the extended surreal dream sequences and the inexplicable narration of Bela Lugosi. Throw Satan in there! Why not? A herd of buffalo stampeding below Lugosi? Why not? Being trampled by the herd would symbolize being run over by society for an urge to cross-dress, wouldn't it? Symbolism! Except the symbolism goes on way too long, one sensing in an effort by Ed Wood to drag his movie over the 60-minute mark. Eventually, it becomes incomprehensible.And what of that narration? Bela Lugosi, the Scientist, is kind of like a half-scientist, half-god character, who's also dark. He has skeletons around him for some reason. He says sinister things. Who or what is he? At the same time, a doctor is telling a police officer about Glen and Glenda. I'm reminded of the Nostalgia Critic's criticism of Rock-A-Doodle- who in god's name is telling the story? The Scientist or the doctor?You can find some elements of this style in a movie like Ingmar Bergman's Persona- random flashing of unpleasant things, apparent dream sequences, a kind of god-like narration (a boy watching a TV), but that movie was competently done.

While this film falls under the category or a B-movie, the film itself is quite groundbreaking.

May be not for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It is a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie. How do you rate it? As a movie very low, as entertainment at least a little higher.The movie tries to explain what a transvestite is and it does this through a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) who talks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who knows about these things. The doctor tells the detective two stories and that is what we, and apparently the scientist, see. The doctor tels these stories because a dead transvestite is found, suicide, and because of a headline in the news paper about a sex-change. The first and longest story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) who is in love and about to marry Barbara (Dolores Fuller) but he has never told her he like to dress as a woman, when he is named Glenda. The movie tells the same thing over and over again, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. The movie almost says that being a transvestite is not a bad thing, but being homosexual is, since it keeps telling us the fact that a transvestite is not a homosexual. The second story is about a transvestite who really wants a sex-change and not just wants to dress up as a woman, but it is much shorter and less interesting.A couple of things make this movie very bad, and therefore laughable. How the story is presented is the first thing, the way the same things are told over and over again and the conclusion of it all are others. This is not where it ends. The acting is very bad, especially Dolores Fuller seems to be reading her lines directly from a little screen somewhere. Every thing she says is funny. The whole dialogue actually gave me quite some laughs.There is also a sequence where someone walks into a room. The door stays half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not completely straight. Then the door, in what seems to be the same shot although we know it is not, is a little less open and suddenly the thing on the wall hangs straight. Ed Wood didn't mind to leave this kind of continuity errors in his movie. May be a good thing, because basically it is just another laugh for the modern audience.

Originally titled I led 2 Lives.The movie starts with Bela Lugosi sitting in a laboratory and telling the theater audience about the mysteries of nature and creation as well as life and death and that nature, as perfect as it is, also makes mistakes. Mixing some chemicals Bela gets what looks like a full head on a mug after you pored a bottle of beer in it and his eyes light up and he says triumphantly A life has begun! Then we see a big city and as the camera focuses in on a room where there's the body of a woman who committed suicide we hear Bela, off camera, sadly says A life is ended. It turns out that the dead woman is a transvestite who was arrested four times for wearing womens clothing and couldn't take being arrested anymore. Since as he wrote in his suicide note That he'd rather be dead in womens cloths then have to live without wearing them. Police inspector Warren, Lyle Talbot, who handled the case of the transvestite was so shook up over it that a few days later he went to a psychiatrist Dr. Alton, Timothy Farrell, just to settle down his nerves from seeing what he did. Dr. Alton tells Inspector Warren a long story about someone that he treated recently who had the same problem that the unfortunate transvestite had but with a happy ending. Glen, Ed Wood, is a man engaged to Babara, Dolores Fuller, but has a deep secret that he's afraid that if he told her it would destroy their relationship and he would lose her. Glen seems to be more in love with Barbara's angora sweater then he is with her. Dr Alton goes on to explain how Glen is a transvestite and what he does to satisfy his yearnings is to wear womens cloths. Dr. Alton goes on saying that to cure Glen of his obsession was for Barbara to except Glen for what he is after Glen confessed to her. Barbara, after taking a few minutes to absorb all that Glen told her tells Glen I don't understand all of this but maybe together we can work it out.We see Dr. Alton telling this story to Inspector Warren in a long weird surrealistic like strip show. We see women appearing on screen in all sorts of dress and undress scenes as well as Bela Lugosi popping up every now and then, mostly off camera. Bela Logosi keeps the audience entertained with saying things like  A story must be told and Pull the string and for some reason that I can't figure out we see a herd of stampeding wild buffalo's in the background. Lugosi starts to get even more ridiculous as the movie rolls on with sayings that make no sense at all in light of the story that were seeing like Dragon tell me, do you eat little boys and puppy dogs tails and big fat snails?. So after Dr. Alton's treatment Glen was completely cured of being Glenda by transferring Glenda, Glen's alter-ego, to Barbara but most of all having Barbara except Glen for what he is, a transvestite. With Barbara allowing Glen to wear her cloths both her and Glen can now live happily ever after. As the movie draws to a close Dr. Alton and almost in cadence Bela Lugosi end the it saying sadly that there are other transvestites like Glen who's stories don't have that same happy ending; and just how many more are there? just how many more are there? What can one say after seeing a movie like this! your left speechless. You have to give Ed Wood credit for not only making Glen or Glenda as well as staring in it with an added attraction at the conclusion of the film of the then,in 1952-53, sensational story about the Christine Jorgesen sex-change operation, that was making headline news all over the world. The biggest surprise of all in regard to the movie is how on earth did Wood ever get it passed the ultra-prudish Hayes Commission back in 1953?

It was made with real passion by someone who understood the issue, but it can be quite off the wall and dull, but its a hell of a lot more intelligent than a lot of the rubbish made today and costing millions of dollars to make. The opening message of Glen or Glenda reminds me of the opening message of Tod Browning's classic 1932 horror film Freaks. The first part of the film begins with a narrator (Bela Lugosi) making cryptic comments about humanity. In a way, Bela Lugosi plays the creator, watching the people moving by their own, making their own decisions. Pull the Strings' meant everyone (puppeteer) is the master of their own destiny (puppets), by pulling the strings so as to control your destiny and bring it wherever you want it to be. These theological ruminations Ed Wood gives us are right up there with Ingmar Bergman's greatest films on the purpose of life and faith in our world. Edward Wood wanted to keep it open to religions who don't believe in the commonly accepted God, or do not call their god(s) God. The Creator is an umbrella term that doesn't offend any particular religion or belief set, nor does it truly suggest religion in the first place (The Creator could be anybody or anything). This way, he doesn't directly accuse religion for people not accepting transsexualism and transvestism, rather he accuses people's stubbornness. The Bela Lugosi portions of the movie seem like such an afterthought to the central story, which is too bad considering that they are also the most compelling. He put Bela in the film, because, at the time, the old man was sick, addicted to drugs, and badly in need of money, and he loved Lugosi so he tried to help him whenever he could. Sadly Bela wasn't in any shape to memorize the ingredients for an ice cube, let alone a movie script, even a bad one. The lines were feed to him, but some lines still didn't match what was being produce half of the scenes (Bisons running around in stock-footage is a example). Maybe a example of not being trampled by life or others. Another one is 'The Dragon at the doorstep' is maybe the mockery, people must fight against to be what he wants to be. Puppy dog tails and big fat snails are the transvestites of the world getting eaten (destroyed) by the Dragon, (mockery from people). The examples of people excuse for sex change, intro-cut with having cars and planes are just out there. This film has artistic merit to it with those lines. With Bela on film, the audience has a hard time figuring out who is the true narrator, due to another narrator later in the film. So it's felt like a story within a story. This part seem like a horror film, while the rest of the film seems like one of those better ways towards clean living type of short films made in the fifties that they showed to kids in school, only instead of promoting personal hygiene, this one is showing you how to justify your life as a transvestite.The film proper opens with Inspector Warren finding the corpse of a male transvestite named Patrick/Patricia, who has committed suicide. Wanting to know more about cross-dressing, Warren seeks out Dr. Alton, who narrates for him the story of Glen/Glenda and the viewers. Ed Wood himself was a transvestite playing Glen under the pseudonym 'Daniel Davis'. Glen is shown studying women's clothes in a shop window. Dr. Alton points out that men's clothes are dull and restrictive, whereas women can adorn themselves with attractive clothing with outrageous/ bizarre claims. Women's clothes comfy? In the days of the Iron Bra and the panty girdle? Glen is getting married to Barbara (Ed's real life girlfriend Dolores Fuller) who questioning if Glen is with another woman. Glen is being force to admit to Barbara about his wanting to wear women clothing. A bizarre dream sequence, containing some BDSM pornography, follows with Satan. Not really need. It ruins the film. Glen then decides to tell Barbara the truth. She proffers her angora sweater as a sign of acceptance. The second part of the story about Alan/ Annie is a letdown, not worth noting. The acting is quite poor, with different actors you can spot Ed Wood's trademark dialogue style.It's this type of pseudo-intellectual verbal non-stop talk that erupts from their mouths for no reason at all. Much like a person reading a book out-loud; there is an unnaturalness to it because we know, deep down in the depths of the human mind, that humans, such as us, do not talk like characters in a audio book. The random shots of things, like dramatic radiator are just odd to be in the film. Looking through the opening credits, it included a Music Consultant, rather than composer, or director. I have no idea what a consultant would be needed for, unless the music he used in this movie was canned or public domain. Found out it's the old theme song as the old Lassie TV show. The dub lines in post-production is funny. That phony granny voice is one thing that's laughable. Unfortunately the film doesn't broach the subject that gender Diaspora & transvestism aren't the same thing. Ed Wood who was probably a very nice man, but a not that good film maker. Working with what he had on a low budget, with a script he had to write in less than 2 days with production starting not long after- to say this was horrible is a understatement. It wasn't that bad. It actually seems pretty progressive for 1953. Rather watch a flaw film made with lots of enthusiasm than a mundane manufactured movie anyday. Just my opinion.

Some honestly unintended avant-garde.Yet the movie is not half as bad as the legend holds it. The important fact is that it isn't an actual story, it's more of a semi-documentary, party educational picture. Behind the really weird editing the movie tells a lot about transvestitism, transsexualism, relationships, sexual identity and social roles. It's hard to believe that it was made in early 1950s! Not only it was produced significantly before the so called sexual revolution of the '60s, but also certain gender issues that were carefully covered in the movie seem to be still beyond the understanding of certain narrow-minded and prejudiced people today.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get to know Edward Wood and his work and also to people interested in the history of approach to gender studies and the society.

There are six alternate titles for this film Glen or Glenda Confessions of Ed Wood, Glen or Glenda?, He or She, I Changed My Sex, I Led 2 Lives, and The Transvestite.Spoiled milk, by any other name...What is important to me is not THAT this film is bad, but WHY it is bad, and if there is anything salvageable from the experience of watching it. The most significant problem of the film is that it is so deeply personal, so internalized for Wood, that it is frequently incomprehensible. If there was ever a film that shows the risks of getting too close to the subject matter, this is it. Gestures, images and dialog from the film have prominence that far outweighs their impact on the viewer. One gets the feeling, after a few minutes, that the film was made by Wood to explain his own nature to himself, and the fact that it was to be seen by others became an unimportant afterthought. For Wood, Bela Lugosi reciting a nursery rhyme in a pathetically melodramatic fashion makes perfect sense. I also assume that it made no sense to poor drug-addled Lugosi, to any of the other characters, or to many of its viewers. A few examples of the film's too subjective, too Wood-centric nature all of Lugosi's lines; the lightning motif that crashes in at random;the fake African tribal dance; the Betty Page antics in the last half of the film (including a pseudo-rape, which is accompanied by polka music). Many scenes indicate a general sense of fear, or transgression, but they aren't specific enough or clear enough to serve as part of the narrative. They are simply hapless gestures from someone desperate to feel personally validated in public. This makes the filmmaker the subject of pathos and not the characters. As a viewer, I empathize more with Ed than Glen. The inept filmmaking distances me from the character of Glen while at the same time eliciting pity for the man who is confronting a source of personal shame by broadcasting it to the world. At times, the film is a documentary, at times a police drama, at times a horror film, at times a love story. Wood uses expressionistic sets, dream sequences, and special effects, and crushes them up against images of traffic and steel mills, and World War II footage, interspersed with monologues by dry professors discussing the current scientific understanding of transvestites. Given all this ineptitude, one has to ask is it worth viewing even as kitsch? I would say so. One learns as much by bad examples as by good. One could easily assemble a `how-to' book on narrative filmmaking using just this film as a negative example. Pick a topic with gravity. Consider your audience. Don't humiliate your actors by giving them nonsensical scripts. Pick music that supports the action. And never underestimate the power of a good laugh.

If you have seen the movie Ed Wood then with Glen or Glenda you can see how idiotic Ed Wood really was and how well Ed Wood captured the essence of his films. Crossdressing was undoubtedly dear to Ed's heart and with Glen or Glenda he was trying to make an important statement about it. However, even if he had been competent enough to manage that, I doubt that 1953 was ready for any statement about crossdressing. The film is so badly made that it's a hoot!

Those who saw this film probably thought, hey that guy reminds me of that dead actor who played Count Dracula, not realizing that like Abe Vigoda, the actor was still very much alive.Lovingly recreated by Tim Burton for  Ed Wood, this film has achieved a legend all its own. Yes, it is wretched, the cross dressers (obviously the transvestites of their day) are sad looking and desperate. Tones have changed for men who long to live as women, and in a sense, this film did more harm than good. Wood at this point wasn't the trollish looking man he would ultimately be a decade later, and his efforts to tell what he considered an important story is respectable if ill-advised.Lugosi stands out of course, as a she'll of himself, but determined to have some sort of dignity, even if they just meant paying off creditors. In the first of his three Ed Eoid appearances, he remains commanding even if the vehicle he prayed would be his comeback failed. Every serious moment Wood intended just brings on laughs, and ultimately, that is why Wood is remembered today.

Wood Jr. came out with this daring, yet incompetently filmed would-be documentary about cross-dressing and sex changes. Wood, a notorious cross-dresser, insisted he was the perfect director for this subject, and with a budget smaller than the amount of change in a normal person's couch cushions, he sort of made a little movie about these themes. At just over an hour, this hodgepodge of stock footage, poorly written and acted scenes, odd fantasy sequences, and old Bela Lugosi rambling on about life and death is truly a finished product that defies a typical synopsis. Pull the stringk!! Lugosi shouts, and he theoretically represents some sort of a puppet master presiding over the human condition. Though Wood should be applauded for his courage in dealing with these subjects, one cannot forgive the incredible ineptitude with which this thing was thrown together. Some of its more interesting and racy moments were apparently thrown in post-production by the producer who obviously wasn't expecting any attempt at a thoughtful documentary from his director. The dramatic scenes deal with a young man (played by Wood under the pseudonym Daniel Davis) engaged to be married, but he's hiding a huge secret. The man loves to wear women's clothing, particularly angora sweaters! Should he tell his fiancÃ©e? How should he tell her? What if she doesn't want to marry a guy like that? The horrors! The scenes dealing directly with this plot make up about a third on the screen time. The biggest chunk of time has a doctor narrating about the differences between transvestites/homosexuals/hermaphrodites among many other things while at the same time explaining them to a police detective. It is in these scenes where some of the most laughable use of stock footage ever can be found. The funniest is perhaps where Wood has inserted footage of a steel mill and two off-screen blue collar types are talking about transsexuals while railroad rails are being forged out of molten steel and sparks are crashing all around! Other random shots of traffic and stampeding buffalo are thrown in. There is a suggestion that some random guy changing a light bulb in a rail yard might be wearing pink satin panties or something... hilarious!! The fantasy scenes go on for about 15 minutes, and make very little sense.Finally, we see the story of a WWII veteran who goes through a sex change. I'm sure they thought this was graphic back then, but its mostly a shot of doctors looking down at the patient while the narration explains in very general terms what is taking place. And the WWII veteran angle only gives Wood even more chances to throw in stock footage of soldiers in battle. The film's conclusion would probably not satisfy the militant LBGT (or is it LGBT?) community of today. It seems the doctor thinks and recommends that the young transvestite man can somehow be cured from his fetish, but I forgot how. Somehow his wife ends up taking the place of Glenda (his cross- dressing alter-ego) and they live happily ever after. Whatever. Anyway, give Wood some serious props for attempting to take a thoughtful look at trans-gender and transvestite issues at a time when they were probably only hinted at within the moldy pages of dime detective novels. 4 of 10 stars.The Hound "},{"Title":"This phony documentary is a terrible mix of metaphysics and biology.","Date":"8 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" *Spoiler/plot- Glen or Glenda, 1953.

Bela Lugosi was broke and a morphine addict at the time so readily took on a role in the film for which he allegedly was paid $5000. In reality, this figure was probably closer to $1000. Shot in just four days. The film was originally intended to be loosely based on the story of sex-change pioneer Christine Jorgensen. In March 1981, Paramount placed a full-page page ad in the New York Times announcing the reissue of Glen or Glenda (1953). Warren Beatty is purported to have sponsored its 1981 reissue by Paramount, while he was working there making Reds (1981). The film includes almost 14 minutes of stock footage, including the end credits, and 73 seconds that run concurrently with new footage of Bela Lugosi.

Similar to some of Ed Wood's other movies, this film is loaded with everything that you would expect to see in his movies, with bad directing, laughable acting, corny dialogue, and several plot points that make no sense whatsoever. First off, I'll admit that I do have a thing for Ed Wood's movies, particularly his 1950's projects, before his sexploitation years. As a result, I decided to watch all of his movies that he made in the 1950's. In my honest to goodness point of view, I'll admit that although this movie is your quintessential Ed Wood picture, that means that it's on the level of so bad it's good. Ed Wood not only directed this movie, he also starred in it, playing the titular character(s). And when I watch this movie, I was not disappointed at all, it was everything that I was expecting it to be, in some sort of way, I guess you can say that Ed Wood was something of a genius, nobody, I repeat, nobody could take bad movies to the so bad it's good level that way that he could.In this movie, the acting is as bad as it could be, although I did enjoy it, I enjoyed laughing at it that is. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who provides narration for the film, although it makes little sense, such as Beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep and eats small boys, or something along the lines of that. And how could I forget the infamous Pull the string! Pull the string! line? I haven't forgotten it I'll tell you that, as that line is immortal. Ed Wood gives a very famous (or infamous) performance as Glen/Glenda, and in addition to his superb directing skills, he also proves that he could be a superb actor as well. Although I will say one thing, his acting skills leave much to be desired. And to add to that, everybody else in the movie does superb jobs as well. By the way, I guess you probably know that I'm being sarcastic right there.To all fans of Ed Wood This movie is legendary, it's the legendary beginning of the career of a director whose career defined the meaning of so bad it's good. When you watch Glen Or Glenda, you'll laugh at all of the cheesy qualities that this movie has. But like I said, considering that it's Ed Wood, he takes the cheesy qualities and elevates it to the level of an art form. The bottom line, is that Glen Or Glenda is a masterpiece of movies that are so bad they're good, and it's also a must see for your education on B-Movies. Needless to say, you should also check out Ed Wood's other 1950's films, particularly he most infamous one, Plan 9 From Outer Space.

Glen or Glenda marked Wood's first film, which he not only written and directed, but also starred in. The film was originally slated to be an biopic on Christine Jorgensen, the propriety of the first publicly known sex change operation (in this case from male to female) Wood however took over production and instead turned it into a film about his own transvestism.Weather you're conservative or liberal on issue of cross-dressing and trans-sexuality, Glen Or Glenda manages to do something which I've seen many sacred cows fail to do, create emotional interest in its main characters, and succeeds to raise question on what it means to be normal, with an issue which is just as relevant today as it was in 1953. The movie's production values are surprisingly good for a film of this cauliber. The surreal dream like sequence in the 2nd half of the movie features some impressive film making techniques and manages to engage you in the character's descent into insanity. Even the film's acting is decent, certainly better than in the likes of Plan 9 from Outer Space.Lugosi's character is widely regarded to be a scientist representing God. At first I didn't understand the character's role in the movie (plus the use of stock of footage is completely random). However I was impressed with how his catch phrase which he utters throughout the course of the movie actually finds its way to having relevance with the plot. I'm not the type of person who over analyzes movies looking for their deeper meaning, but in Glen or Glenda it really came through quite obviously, and did leave an impression on me, as well as changing my opinions on Wood as a director. I can defiantly sense Ed Wood put a lot legitimate feeling into this movie, and certainly comes through in the finished product.

Well, it was supposed to be a biopic on Christine Jorgensen, the subject of the first, well-known, sex change, but Wood transformed the story into a semi- autobiography about his cross-dressing habit and how the society looks down on those like him.Essentially, this is a sociological docudrama about transvestites and pseudo-hermaphrodites, depicting tribal rituals and connecting them with contemporary social issues, laced with a slight comedic touch and filled with loads of idiosyncratic stock footage and featuring a narrator speaking cryptic, pseudo-philosophical, non-sequitur lines in a shlocky B-horror film spook-lab, but then it turns into an auto- biographic plea for compassion to viewers and follows two stories of two characters, intercut with strange nursery rhymes and interrupted by an impressionist/psychological horror-themed surrealist dream sequence featuring vignettes of sadomasochism, rape, religious imagery and an autoerotic session, only to shift back and forth between fourth wall-breaking reactions of both the narrator and the protagonist, in a 68-minute film with three separate narrators and NUMEROUS confusing flashbacks-within-flashbacks containing said narrations.We also learn that hats make you bald.Ed Wood certainly outdid himself on this one. It was shot in four days and starred his idol Bela Lugosi, in one of his last roles, as the narrator who sits in a chair the entire time and sometimes does chemical experiments. Wood played Glen under the pseudonym Daniel Davis, and his girlfriend Dolores Fuller was cast as Barbara.Glen or Glenda is a hysterical and entertaining movie, that is until the storyline unexpectedly starts following Alan instead of Glen, about 55 minutes in.

However, instead of getting an emotional narrative on the life of the transvestites and how they struggle to get people to accept and understand them (as well as their internal conflicts), we got a horribly narrated documentary type movie with abysmal acting and lazy writing. I don't even blame the concept of the film, because this (like I said before) could have been incredibly powerful and have more of the characters interacting with each other and trying to cope with society's hatred toward them, which in turn would get intolerant people attached to the characters, therefore causing them to question their beliefs. In fact, I think that this could have been one of the greatest movies of all time if the writing was not so dull and lifeless, if the acting was not laugh out loud ridiculous, and if it was not a god damn documentary type movie. Think about it, if more effort and editing was done to the script, if the actors had even a shred of talent (except for Bela Lugosi), and if it was more of a narrative than a documentary, it could have been a masterpiece.

He not only wrote and directed it, he acted in it himself and told his own story of cross dressing. It's sad that Wood did not have the talent or the budget to bring this off.As we all know now thanks to Johnny Depp's biographical portrayal of Wood that Wood liked to wear feminine attire. So given the accepted knowledge of the time, no doubt gleaned from his many visits to a psychiatrist, Wood fashioned Glen Or Glenda and gave himself the title role.The film is done documentary style as police detective Lyle Talbot investigates the suicide of a man found dead in women's clothes. Seeking information for future encounters, Talbot meets with psychiatrist Timothy Farrell who talks about two cases of men dressing as women one of those being Glen/Glenda the other being Alan/Ann.Knowing several transgender individuals as I do they and I both see this thing as laughable in its ignorance. Not to mention the acting and writing was on the level of a high school play. Bela Lugosi has a part in here as an overall narrator who is given to saying cryptic things in a sinister fashion that you will search in vain in trying to figure out what they mean. No one talked sinister better than Bela Lugosi, but this was Bela's first association with Wood and Wood being so happy to have a box office name of sorts for his project just shoehorned him the best way he could. Why he just wasn't playing the psychiatrist is beyond me. Wood was a terrible actor to add to being a terrible writer and director. But he was not alone as the rest of the cast is pretty bad as well. Yet in his own clumsy untalented way, Ed Wood was giving us a glimpse of his world and how people in general saw individuals like him in 1953. No doubt most who see this especially transgender folks will think this as bad a film as I do, but it's an incredible insight into the world of its creator.

First let me say that I find some of the other reviews almost as ridiculous as this movie. Calling it some sort of 'ahead of its time GLBT' classic or any sort of 'serious look' at anything is simply finding pearls among the dog doo. The storyline is very thin; some parts of the movie are not even related to the storyline and are inexplicable, such as the silent (with background music) scenes of one woman tying up another lying on a couch, or a guy whipping a woman lying on the same couch, or Ed Wood (as Glen/da) making a face that looks like he's being electrocuted while a little girl's voice echoes in the background Puppy dog tails! Puppy dog tails! Puppy dog tails! Now really, is this a GLBT treasure? There are obviously some men dressed as women in some scenes of the movie, none of whom are any more of a feminine nightmare than Wood himself dressed as Glenda.

Ed Wood Jr., for all his limitations, mostly financial, was a genius in my opinion. Plan 9 from Outer Space is great Sci.Fi. The production values are dreadful but somehow forgivable. Glen or Glenda doesn't suffer nearly as much from the poor production values, mostly because you're too busy trying to follow the incomprehensible plot line, the Belly Dancing sequence alone can put you in a near trance state.

However, he certainly isn't the Worst Filmmaker of All Time as many people ignorantly label him. His films, while technically inept, are personal statements of the man's obsessions. Despite the fact I prefer Plan 9 From Outer Space, I consider this to be the quintessential Ed Wood film. It is a reflection of who the man was. Transvestism, Bela Lugosi, classic Hollywood, and family all play a part in this portrait of the man's mind.The script is quite autobiographical. Glen is an ordinary man (not a homosexual as the narrator inter tones roughly ten times) engaged to a young girl named Barbara (as the narrator reminds us about ten times also). The only potential problem in this marriage is that Glen is a transvestite, which he is afraid of revealing to Barbara. He is worried that she won't be able to cope with this.The story is just a springboard for everything that was in Mr. Wood's surrealistic mind. The dream sequence is him attempting to portray how society will shun him just like his father (represented as Lucifer himself) did. This legendary scene is as bizarre as anything Ken Russel or Luis Bunuel ever attempted. Than there's Bela Lugosi as the narrator. He appears on screen as the scientist (possibly God), offering bizarre phrases against the backdrop of a laboratory. He seems to be controlling the fate of all mankind, or something like that, it's never really explained. This whole story is being told to a police inspector by a psychiatrist. At least they're placement in the film is explained.The whole film is goofy and surreal, often somewhere between. However, it is a highly personal statement of Ed Wood's fears and problems, and therefor should not be called the worst film ever made. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckenheimer have never attempted anything this personal as far as I can recall. In fact this film (along with Plan 9) ranks up there with Reefer Madness, El Topo, and Spider Baby as one of the ultimate cult classics. Anyone with an appreciation of cult or surreal cinema is highly implored to check this film out.

How could a 70 minute movie feel like it drags on and on and on and doesn't end? I'm glad you asked. It's the sheer level of depth in Glen or Glenda's narration. Yes, I said depth, and yes this is Ed Wood's Glen or Glenda I'm talking about. Bear with me.Now when I describe Glen or Glenda as having depth and numerous layers, I'm not saying the film is philosophically deep by any stretch. I simply mean there are multiple levels of narration going on. The film opens with a textual statement about the integrity of the film, and how it attempts to present the facts unbiased, and warns the audience not to judge. Two minutes later, we're watching a bad lightning effect flash across a darkened sky to punctuate scene transitions of this pseudo-documentary style . . . horror film? Then we have Bela Lugosi who opens and closes the film like a twisted take on masterpiece theatre, and we occasionally cut or dissolve to him so he can deliver an ambiguous and unnecessary line in that thick Hungarian accent that would forever remind us he was, is, and forever will be Dracula &#150; Pull the strings! Pull the strings! Lugosi speaks as the grand maestro of the fates with magical powers beyond this world (although the credits are content to call him scientist). Bela informs us that it has begun. A life has begun; a life has ended. Cut to a detective finding a dead transvestite, complete with a voice over narration (which is not done by Lugosi). This same detective winds up speaking to a psychiatrist where we have an oversimplified discussion on transvestites. The psychiatrist tells the detective the story of Glen. Cut to Glen, who is Glenda, and his life as he's getting ready to marry Barbara (voice over narration still going.) He faces the tough decision of telling her the truth about Glenda. At one point, Glen has a dream or daydream or epiphany or something. Cut to a completely incoherent sequence (more accurately phrased a nonsensical juxtaposition of several completely incoherent sequences) that's supposed to be symbolic.The dream is beyond description, and it exists beyond the reaches of criticism. Ed Wood's ineptitude surpasses this critic's ability to bash it. I could describe it, but 1 - my description would make more sense and 2 &#150; people would assume I'm exaggerating or say Duh, it's Ed Wood! And, you know, I could try to be witty and make fun of it . . . but the sequence, itself, is way funnier than anything I could write. I'm strangely awed and impressed over Ed Wood's mastery over crap. You have to see it to believe it. If nothing else, rent Glen or Glenda for the dream. You'll thank me later.Okay, we're through with the dream. Cut back to Glen. Resolve that issue. Cut back to the psychiatrist. But wait? The story isn't over! Cut to Allan, who served in the military. Cut to an abundance of war stock footage. Cut back to Allan. He has a sex change operation to become Ann. Okay, we're done with Ann. Cut back to the shrink. Wait! Wait! Wait! We're not done with Glen. Cut back to Glen to give the *final* resolution on Glen's problem. Okay, now cut back to the shrink. Their discussion is over. Cut back to Lugosi. He's sitting in the chair with the big book in his hand, precisely as we found him at the beginning of the movie. And what's this? The end credits? Hooray! It's amazing how Glen or Glenda can be so incredibly deep, and yet so laughably shallow. Unbelievable how aggressively terrible a film can be while the director strives to achieve a good product (To this day, I still can't suspend my disbelief to the fact Eddie honest to God tried for good movies.) Breathtaking how the man had no restraint, and threw together elements that so sharply contrasted with one another to point of defeating his purpose entirely. And it's mind boggling how much of the running time is composed of stock footage (open question &#150; anyone know the ratio of stock footage vs original footage? I'm seriously curious, because it seemed like the stock footage outweighed Ed Wood's material.) You might have noticed I really didn't comment much on the details of the plot. There's a good reason it doesn't exist. The film is too busy cutting between its various levels of narration to really embrace a plot. It's like opening a present on Christmas morning to find another layer of wrapping paper, and another, and another, and then finally we get a box containing a Christmas card.If Wood were to film MacBeth in the same style as Glen or Glenda we'd find out Macbeth became king; he had a dream involving mirrors; and he was overthrown and spend the rest of the time cutting between Lugosi (written in as a master Warlock or something), a student talking to an English Teacher, and a few scenes from Hamlet.At any rate, Glen or Glenda has all the ingredients of a classic Ed Wood.

That being said, it remains an incredibly funny film to watch, that mercifully clocks in a little more than an hour. The film attempts to both provide a 'documentary' view on the need for compassion in understanding cross-dressing, and a 'horror' movie that completely demonizes the same. Bela Lugosi stars as a scientist (within both plot and sub plot, inexplicably)whose role in the film is inexplicable except for the fact that Wood probably simply wanted the opportunity to work with him. Lugosi's sputtering phrases of doom are completely divorced from the painfully Spartan plot unfolding in the movie- he repeats a nursery rhyme a number of times in his mad scientist's lair to the backdrop of lighting and constant thunder. In one scene, Wood shamelessly uses nearly 5 minutes of WWII footage for no real reason. Wood's understanding of pacing is non-existent- we are told the story must be told 4 or so times, the last being more than halfway through the movie. A scene in which, I would assume, Glen is attempting to suppress his inner 'Glenda', is profoundly disturbing. A prolonged string of images of half-naked women (whom the viewer has not seen thus far) being whipped and nearly raped is accompanied by gleeful Tin Pan Alley music.Though hilarious, this film's turgid dialogue, shameless use of stock footage and nudity (by 1950's standards, I would assume), and cruelty towards its characters leads it beyond camp into the territory of sociology. It's not often one can claim that about a film.

Considering that it was made in 1953, this is a very courageous movie about transvestites, tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically (and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject) and trying very hard not to stereotype. The movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals, and that aside from wearing women's clothing they lead a relatively normal life. It deals with the pain of not being accepted in society - the plot revolves around a police officer (Lyle Talbot) desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite. So, you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial (in the context of 1953) subject.Having said all that, I'm also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful. In trying to portray Glen/Glenda's (Edward D. Wood) pain, the movie falls into silly (and at times surprisingly - again given the era - sensual) fantasies that make the story very hard to follow. The acting is wooden at best. None of the dialogue comes across as real; the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others. And - worst of all - there was no point to having Bela Lugosi in this movie. This was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career. Pull the strings; pull the strings, poor Lugosi's character (called The Spirit in the credits, but really coming across as more of a mad scientist) kept crying. And nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie.For artistic merit, the movie doesn't really deserve much more than 1/10.

We will never know how much Tim Burton's 1994 depiction of 'Glen or Glenda's' open-mouthed reception at Warners' matched the reality, but probably it wasn't too far off. And may the suits be forever despised for their narrow minded lack of vision. It was in 1953, as the guns of Korea fell silent and America got ready for sex, courtesy of Monroe, Dean and Presley. Into this changing world came the pencil-moustacheod, angora-wearing figure of Edward D Wood Junior, a proto John Waters and all American hero who had parachutted onto the beaches of Normandy wearing a brassiere, aware that his bravery would have meant nothing in the face of the dishonourable discharge that would have been automatic had his secret been unveiled. Glen or Glenda was his statement to the world be tolerant, a few TVs wearing womens' garments at home won't usher in the end of civillisation. We start with a decrept Bela Lugosi warning us to 'bevare of the big Green Dragon..he eats little boys!' Then we find a police officer and shrink chatting over the recent suicide of a transvestite...long-winded dialogue commences before our hero is introduced, Glen.

Fans of Burton's Ed Wood will know that Screen Classics boss Georgie Weiss originally wanted a 'sex change flick' for 'those repressed Okies' but Wood's script was pretty lop-sided, not being about that til 5 pages near the end. The rest is about some schmuck who likes Angora sweaters! The film is a sad reflection of how low Lugosi had sunk at the end and it does make you wonder how accurate was the Depp-Landau portrayal of Wood as a nice, if talentless guy who just wanted to help out his idol. By the standards of 1952, parts of Glen's nightmare scene are a bit saucy and does hint at where Wood eventually went, in the direction of soft porn. It is a pity that he died in 1978. The special effects boom and gender-bending fashions of the 1980s could have let him direct 'Dr Acula' with aplomb.

This movie almost defies description. Told in semi-docudrama style with an unseen narrator explaining the plot ... such as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr.) who cross-dresses; hence the reference to Glenda. The film has no real structure. Instead, it consists mostly of a random assortment of vignettes that may ... or may not ... relate to Glen or to the cross-dressing motif. One long sequence consists of some unknown woman wriggling on a sofa, followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today refer to as S&M.Then, at odd moments Bela reappears, for no apparent reason, and babbles more inane dialogue, like When he's wrong because he does right, and when he's right because he does wrong; pull the string, dance to that. Huh?About twenty percent of the film's visuals consist of stock footage, accompanied by a VO that relates to the story motif but not the visuals. Hence, we see stock footage of bustling city streets, freeway traffic, a thunderous herd of buffalo, and a playground full of kids. But it gets worse. In a film about cross-dressing, we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a foundry furnace making hot steel, and 84 consecutive seconds of battle scenes from WWII.Even the simplest items are botched. In one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl. Underneath the headline, which has clearly been glued or pasted on, the article is about ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes, an off-screen woman spouts out airplanes, why it's against the creator's will, in a voice that sounds like she's just inhaled helium.Except for the performance of Lyle Talbot, the acting is uniformly horrendous. Production design is cheap looking and drab; (but you gotta love that tacky wallpaper). The editing is sloppy. Most of the background music is suitable only for 1950 style elevators. The B&W cinematography has way too much contrast.

This film honestly challenges the audience to accept peoples difference in a way which no prior American film, at least which I am aware of ever did.Glen or Glenda discusses the ideas of putting personal happiness before conforming to society. The film challenges society as a whole to question, what is an isn't acceptable and how views on other acceptable activities have changed over the years.The film itself primary focuses on the story of a young couple named Glen and Barbra (Ed Wood, Deloris Fuller) whom are to be married. Glen secretly likes to dress in women's clothing and is unable to tell Barbra. The story is narrated by a psychologist (Timothy Farrell) who is explaining the story to a police officer (Lyle Talbot) who is questioning the ethics of discriminatory laws after being called to a suicide of a transvestite. Eventually Glen tells Barbra about his cross dressing, she decides she still wants to marry Glen. There is also a small sub-story about a sex change.The film works for reasons beyond its progressiveness, because the viewer honestly cares about the people involved. I genuinely wanted Glen to come to terms with himself, and I was happy to see him and Barbra get married.The film ages well and is still relevant, especially with many of the political issues of today.

So naturally his films today are viewed as the products of the worst director of all time. Certainly Brided of the Monster or Plan 9 are nothing but reasonably well executed b movies but Glen or Glenda is actually different. It would be an interesting experiment to show the film to people who have never heard of Ed Wood and tell them it's by an intellectual French film maker and give people the opportunity to judge the film without preconceptions. Would they see Lugosi's character and performance as camp or as legimitate surrealsim or his use of stock footage as a collage technique? It is very easy to make fun of this film because in these days the story seems trite and even camp. When watching this film you have to bear in mind that cross dressing and homosexuality (although the film actually makes the point that both are not necessarily related) were not only taboo topics but plainly illegal. Wood tells the autobiographic story of a heterosexual male who cross dresses and has to come to terms with this urge and learn to accept himself. To my knowledge that is the first film to give anyone termed a degenerate by society depth and dignity. Seeing Glen or Glenda simply as a camp classic draws away attention from the fact that Wood was a pioneer and also very courageous because he is in the lead role. The film itself is not really badly made except for the use of stock footage only loosely related to the film. The structure of the film is actually rather clever. The acting is more or less competent (certainly not worse than a lot of other b films I have watched), there are no wobbly sets and the story is coherent. Often fun has been made of Lugosi's character. I don't really see why. Yes, it's odd but Lugosi gives one hell of a charismatic performance and we don not generally call every film that employs surreal elements turkeys.

However, this movie has a trigger somewhere. At one point, all of Wood's overall weirdness becomes so irresistibly overwhelming that you just give in to it and have a great time. I'm talking about the little segment where he gets creative with the devil, tie-up games, looped dialogue and Bela Lugosi. Had David Lynch directed these scenes, well let's not go there. As for the rest of the movie it's charming, it has a heart, it has incoherent Bela Lugosi speeches, but I can't deny it bores sometimes. The dialogues are just too long and provide little to none classic Wood lines. I mean sure, there's pull the strink, dance to that! but again, that's Lugosi.

It was sad to see Bela Lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film, but it was kind of Ed Wood Jr. to at least give Mr. Lugosi an acting job at a time in Bela's life when he was penniless and a drug addict and no one else in Hollywood would hire him.

Wood Jr. as as a writer/producer/director/actor. I have been a fan of Ed Wood for several years now. While I don't like this as much as some of his other films it was probably the largest insight that the cinematic going public gets of Wood during his life. Everybody knows that he was a transvestite. This film is about changing one's sex and how being a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones. This film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject matter and how it deals with it. However, the film still contains Wood's usual pitfalls of bad dialog, meaningless stock footage, and hokey special effects. Throw in Wood's usual overdose of Bela Lugosi hamming it up and you have Wood's first attempt at being a director.The plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines. The doctor tells him the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but can't bring himself to tell her about his secret. He also tells the inspector about Alan who undergoes a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary on what is going on (Lugosi's part really isn't well defined and proves to be most likely a vehicle for Wood to have a star in his film and Lugosi to get some cash).All in all, the movie shows the hallmarks of Wood's career. It was obviously shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather haphazardly. It definitely has the it's so bad, it's good feel to it. However, I do have to applaud Ed on his progressive thinking in making this film. Transvestitism and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s. Wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and putting a more human face on cross-dressing.

The form of the movie slides back and forth between docudrama and educational film. Bela Lugosi is the film's god, the scientist. A mad, cackling, spiteful old man who controls our fates but never seems to know what he's doing. Timothy Farrel, known for playing gangsters and thugs, plays the equally crazy psychiatrist. As voice-over narrorator, he smugly explains that the reason men go bald and women don't is that men's hats are so tight they cut off the blood flow to the head while women's hats are loose and comfortable.

The crescendo of the story is Glen's nightmare, where Satan is witness at his wedding. Unfortunately, the nightmare is interrupted by a stag reel producer George Weiss threw in to make the movie more exploitable and to pad out the running time.

His mind was a muddle past all sorting out; even here, dealing with the subject closest to his heart -- or at least, to his skin -- he is unable to decide whether to assert that cross-dressing is nothing to be upset about, or should be decriminalized, but treated psychiatrically -- while the looming interpolations from Lugosi suggest the whole subject is less than a step away from the diabolic -- although the sole really coherent line Lugosi speaks, his last, the story is told, is a big, fat lie; as always with Wood, the story is the first casualty.I greatly enjoyed the recent film bio of Ed Wood (especially the fictional but delicious encounter with Orson Welles, where genius and ineptitude find common ground in a love-feast of egocentric non-communication), but am unable to concur in the general belief that Wood had a passion for making movies.  With every allowance for budgetary constraints and the patchwork production-schedules they imposed, Wood was slovenly, impatient past belief, either as a director, cinematographer or (above all) a writer for the screen; nothing is too hasty, too botched, too half-baked for him to put in the can.  No, what he desired was the prestige, the self-esteem, the celebrity of being a man who had made movies, and the actual making was something to be got out of the way as cheaply, expeditiously and painlessly as possible.  Even so, he remains a unique and rather lovable demonstration of ambition that can triumph over anything, even a complete absence of talent.

Wood uses raw slabs of innocuous, incidental stock footage, and then builds a story around them - and what a story!!  Wood himself stars as Glen, a regular Joe who just happens to enjoy lounging around in his fiancee's lingerie and sweaters.  I think what Wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the Glens of this world by showing that Glen is just like all of us underneath, only in angora.  Ummm...ok.  But then, we get this very bizarre montage of some horny devil, a chick in bondage, some rude, pointing people, some moore stock footage, and finally an emaciated Bela Lugusi,playing some kind of twisted, invalid Puppetmaster.

However, I thought the opening sequence was terrific, the cinematography isn't too shoddy, the score has some atmosphere, Wood directs with heart and although some of his line delivery is rather slow Bela Lugosi's presence is magnetic.

Glen or Glenda I'm surprised was made as it seems very edgy for it's time. At a time where it was more conservative and sex changes were virtually unheard of, this film pushes boundaries. Ed Wood of course is named as the worst director of all time and I'm curious why because while his films are bad at times, they have a lot of passion behind them and he was able to tell a story. He was an outcast of Hollywood and knew what it was like to be judged at all times, especially as this was his vision. But he was born to make movies and even though this movie is a big WTF he had a style no less and in some way you could consider this an art house film. I'm not saying that this film is all good, it's very sloppy and disorganized as well as there's some very questionable dialog green dragon on your door step and slow snails and dog tails, very odd. But like I said, this film was very ahead for it's time and still to this day carries a strong message.The film opens with Inspector Warren finding the corpse of a male transvestite named Patrick/Patricia, who has committed suicide. Wanting to know more about cross-dressing, Warren seeks out Dr. Alton, who narrates for him the story of Glen/Glenda. Glen is shown studying women's clothes in a shop window. Dr. Alton points out that men's clothes are dull and restrictive, whereas women can adorn themselves with attractive clothing. Glen reads about sex change operations in a newspaper, then meets with Barbara, his girlfriend, who asks if Glen's secret problem is another woman. Another transvestite friend of his, John, tells Glen how cross-dressing ended his marriage. A bizarre dream sequence, containing some weird pornography, follows. Glen then decides to tell Barbara the truth. She offers her angora sweater as a sign of acceptance.I'm curious if Ed Wood was still alive how he would think of our society where we are starting to accept homosexuality more and more. Also the term metro sexual and how males are a lot more feminine that we accept a man men who wear a little make up or get their eyebrows done. Who knows, maybe this movie helped as clearly in some way it did educate people about transvestites. I think the dream sequence is what really threw this movie off, I mean we have this weird girl getting whipped by a guy, then a strange strip tease and then a horrific rape scene. I don't think I would want to know Ed Wood if he did acid because I wonder what he was on when he was writing this script.Bela Lugosi is used as a narrator and almost like a God who pulls the strings of the people in the story. He does a great job with the dialog that he's given and is really frightening with the atmosphere. Watching this movie really brought me a lot closer to Ed Wood and his world. The movie Ed Wood is one of my favorite films of all time but I know a lot of it was fictional so I have to make the judgments on my own with what I think Ed Wood must have really been like. But supposedly this was the movie to watch that he said if you wanted to get to know him to watch Glen or Glenda. I would recommend this movie for those who are curious about Ed Wood or have an open mind to this edgy film. Like I said, it's amazing this movie was made and while it may be garbled up and have some cheesy acting, it really does work for it's message and Ed Wood was destined to tell others judge ye not.6/10 "},{"Title":"Ed Wood's supremely bizarre cinematic meditation on transvestitism","Date":"1 July 2010","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Nobody could make a entertainingly awful movie with quite the same warped imagination or infectiously loopy go-for-it enthusiasm as the late, great, and downright legendary Ed Wood. This singular ode to cross-dressing rates highly as one of the single most mind-boggling messes to ever stumble its way onto celluloid. On one hand it's a compassionate and nonjudgmental plea for tolerance, acceptance, and understanding that's done with a certain endearingly clunky sincerity and pure honesty (Wood goes to great lengths to note that transvestitism and homosexuality are two very different things). However, it's also a gloriously ghastly train wreck of a film complete with plentiful what's-he-doing-here? footage of a ranting Bela Lugosi as a deranged scientist on an incredibly cheap set who spouts all kinds of absurd gibberish, overheated dialogue (Pull the string!), hopelessly atrocious acting, a slushy score, a meandering narrative, and a hilariously surreal dream set piece that manages to be funny, poetic, silly, and even erotic in equal measure. Wood displays an all-out ineptitude as a filmmaker that's easily matched by his undeniable earnestness. It's this earnest quality which in turn gives this picture its uniquely cracked charm. Yeah, Wood was a terminally fumbling director with no real knack or talent, but man did this guy have a lot of heart just the same. Said heart is all over this movie -- and that's exactly why in the long run this film proves to be oddly affecting as well as unintentionally amusing. Moreover, one must admire the courage it took for Wood to deal with such bold taboo subject matter head-on back in the extremely repressive 50's. Art it sure ain't, but boy is it really something to behold. "},{"Title":"GLEN OR GLENDA Extended Re-issue Version (Edward D. Wood Jr. and, uncredited, W.

Besides, Lugosiâs idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward hereâ¦though Woodâs script is mostly to blame for this â given the impossible dialogue (with repeated nonsensical allusions to âpuppy-dog tailsâ and âbig fat snailsâ) he handed the ailing star! By the way, Wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym Daniel Davis) â and, being just as worthless in this area, proves to have been an all-round dog!; Dolores Fuller â his wife and co-star â was similarly untalented (she would also appear in JAIL BAIT 1954)â¦but, at the very least, the image where the latter finally lets Glen wear her angora sweater did give Tim Burtonâs affectionate biopic ED WOOD (1994) its famous poster! Incidentally, the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between Wood and Orson Welles â well, for all intents and purposes, GLEN OR GLENDA constitutes Ed Woodâs CITIZEN KANE (1941) given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques in fact, the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore (many of it irrelevant, such as the bewildering instances of S&M) and inane dream sequences (highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make Martin Scorsese weep with envy)! The filmâs sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction/phenomenon of transvestism is, however, sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach.For what itâs worth, the edition I watched was the âExtended Re-issue Versionâ which included six minutes of âdepravedâ footage (directed by W. Merle Connell) censored on original release! Furthermore, my copy went out-of-synch every so often (which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track) â though, thankfully, this was the fault of the source conversion to DivX as opposed to the film itself.

It seems out of place when considering that the rest of the movie comes off as a documentary on transvestism. Its as if Vincent Price was doing his thing and the director randomly placed his scenes at various points throughout the movie. And the movie is Super Size Me. This movie is wrought with Ed Wood's technique. There is more stock in an Ed Wood movie than there is on Wall Street. There's nothing I like better than a close up of a radiator at a suicide scene. I also love all the numerous shots of Ed walking or crossing the street. And what about all the highway shots and lighting shots. Classic Ed. There is also a scene that seems to be straight out of the Orgy of the Dead. It seems be stock footage from an S&M movie of the time with a jazz & polka soundtrack (another Ed staple). The dialogue is about as good as a decent porn movie. The sets are not much better. They're flat and angular. There are other technique's worth noting  the conversation with no one in the shot, and then suddenly someone walks in; the jump cut; the coming through the door but not closing the door and then someone walks in after a jump cut shot; Glenda coming in through the door and something falls off the paper thin wall shot.This movie is bad. There's a part at the beginning where the movie is assuming we're laughing at the sight of a bearded man in women's clothing. How right the narrator is, too bad it's not the man we're laughing at.

The rest of the film deals with two cases being discussed between a psychiatrist and a policeman who has just witnessed a transvestite that has committed suicide.  I see that many of the reviewers commend Mr. Wood for his bravery on approaching such a topic, but what seems to be lost to many of them is that this man, at least it seems so to me, had one heck of a problem.  He is taking abnormal behaviour and trying to justify its existence in a film that is not meant to be a fictionalization but rather a cry from Wood to be normal and excepted.  Doesn't wash with me, but still is fun to watch for its ineptitude.  I will agree the film has heart, though this is not enough to make it a good film.  Some of the scenes are just too bizarre, too incomprehensible for explanation.  Wood plays the titular characters(although using another name)and his performance is lacklustre at best.

As with all of Ed Wood films, people tend to primarily mock the visual silliness the bad special effects, the moronic documentary footage, the awful sets, bad costumes, etc. But I am much more fascinated with the incredibly bad dialog - undoubtedly the dumbest in movie history. Ed Wood's scripts are in fact so badly written that even the English language is torn apart at times; there are grammatical errors (e.g. A new life is begun, or a word like hisself), questionable choices of words for descriptions, and some truly chaotic sentences (like this one?).Lugosi starts off the movie with a rambling monologue that makes no sense at all (one of Ed Wood's lovable attempts at depth), while we see buffalo roaming the U.S. landscapes in the background; this sort of scene could only come from Ed Wood. He got some buffalo footage for free so he used it; if he had acquired footage of bees or rats or giraffes instead, he would have used that. Soon after Lugosi's monologue, we are witnesses to a first in a series of hilarious dialogues between a police inspector and a psychiatrist (or something). These two talk like idiots straight out of an asylum; at one point the cop explains to the other guy (and the audience) what a policeman's job is! And then he says As in most jobs there is always somebody who doesn't want that job to be done. This is a classical Ed Wood attempt to make a wise statement on something. If Wood had only spent ten seconds thinking about this statement he would have realized how dumb it is, and erased it from the script. But that's the way he was whatever idea came into his mind immediately found its place on the typewriter, without him spending a single second thought about it (the idea, not the typewriter).I don't think that he was THAT dumb; he was a dreamer living in his own cloud-world. That a self-deluded man and talentless director such as Ed Wood would do a transvestite drama was an incredible stroke of luck for future B-movie aficionados everywhere. Wood hammers us with his definitions of transvestism over and over and over; it seems that never ten minutes pass without either the narrator or an actor telling us what a transvestite is and why he isn't necessarily a homosexual.

I mean, look at this film. Glen and Glenda was not a huge success in the 50s causing Ed Wood to be considered one of the worst directors out there at the time, but look at this film. It is about transsexuals, transvestites, and sex change operations. These were topics not discussed in modern cinema at the time. In fact, I don't know of any that dealt with this issue. Wood opened the door. He talks, he thinks, he expresses his feelings into this film, and the final result may seem a bit Mystery Science Theater 3000-ish, but the honest truth is that it works so well in today's society. Throughout this entire film I couldn't help laughing, not just at the poor production and the scene where Glen's fiancÃ©e gives him her sweater, but also that this type of story is happening today. There are people that deal with situations like this all the time in our modern society.This had me thinking, was this just a cheap film for Ed Wood Jr., or was it nothing short of brilliant. Here we have a director who created a film well before its time that was not understood when it was released, but somehow really really works today. Think about it for a second. Here you have this man, who loves to dress as a woman, but is afraid because of what society may think. We have those issues now. There are so many closeted homosexuals in our society that are afraid to be themselves because of what others may think. Glen feels this. He experiences it with his own fiancÃ©e, a woman that is supposed to love him no matter what issues come across their table. Then there is Alan, a GI for all things, which comes back from the war, and wants to be a woman. This is wild. When I was watching this, my mind was being blown away. Remember the headline news years back about gays in the military? Perhaps everyone should be watching this film. I never knew a film like this existed. It has been a long time since I have seen Tim Burton's film about Ed Wood, but now I want to revisit it.Now, I will admit, there were some scenes that just screamed cheesy B-rated film. Bela Lugosi's entire part in this film was absurd. The fact that he was a scientist, trying to talk about the changes in our society and how they are affecting people like Glen, was interesting, but difficult to take in noting Lugosi's deep accent. BEEEVAAARE. HA! That still has me laughing two days after watching the film. But, it isn't laughter of disgust. It is laughter of enjoyment. There was a huge level of enjoyment to this film. It is short movie, so Wood gets straight to the point, interrupting for just a brief moment to have this wildly sexual dance in the middle. This film reminded me of some of Christopher Guest's very early styled mocu-mentaries. Sure, Wood didn't have the money to make an elaborate picture. He used stock footage and voice-overs half the time. You could tell that budget was low because he was in it as the title character (I think that also had something to do with his interest in the subject), but for me it worked.Overall, this was a very humorous and eye opening film. For those that comment on how dated the story is, I don't know. I really think that Wood's film has so much to offer today's society. While not all the facts are correct, he was brave enough to make a film about it. Who else was going to do that in the 50s &#133; oh, when times were better? I stand-up and applaud Wood for this film and really suggest everyone going out and experiencing this one for the first time. It is enjoyable, sinful, and jaw dropping all at the same time. I am surprised that Wood's time machine didn't show up in this film somewhere along the line, because it was as if he was looking directly into our society. It was bizarrely beautiful.

Being familiar with Ed Wood's story and having seen the most wonderful biopic Ed Wood (1994) several times, I admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved; I still admire his never-say-die attitude. He had a love for directing that I wish more people in modern-day Hollywood had.But that doesn't make his movies any more fun to watch. And Glen or Glenda, his first and most confessional film, is probably his very worst.Glen or Glenda is a deadening cult movie about a cross-dresser named Glen (played by director/writer Ed Wood himself) who despite his love for his fiancÃ©e Barbara (Dolores Fuller), cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism, in which he dresses in women's clothing and a wig and thus becomes...Glenda! Glen/Glenda's story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called The Scientist played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there's also some sub-story about an Alan/Anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the Christine Jorgenson story, upon whom this movie originally titled I Changed My Sex! was previously to be based.Have I dropped your jaw yet? Well, as much as I want to warn you off this picture if you've never seen it, I would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis I just gave you. Every thing in it is true. This is a movie about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner. I'm sure that with a good screenplay, and a good director (it had neither) that Glen or Glenda, despite the subject matter, could have been a very moving picture. It is a confessional movie on Wood's part, as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen. But once again, that does not make it a good movie...or a watchable one for that matter. Glen or Glenda is a jumbled, disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. It makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where Bela Lugosi screams Pull the string! over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison. The majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice, reminding me of some very bad short informative films I've seen before. It's like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventy-minute feature and twice as dull. We sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens. The only moments that are worth anybody's time are those of Bela Lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches. I guess Lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film, but personally, I couldn't care less who or what he's supposed to be. I'll tell you what he was A gifted actor who wound up making trash. But he and Wood were very good friends and liked working with each other, so good for him.I will always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for the cinema, but I will never as long as I live admire his movies. A film critic once called Ed Wood's movies innocent fun but I think even that is questionable. Innocent? Yes. Fun? No, sir. And if Citizen Kane is the Mount Everest of the cinematic world, then Glen or Glenda is probably the Mariana Trench.

Wood, Jr.'s plea for tolerance against men who like to dress in women's clothing reminds us countless times that they aren't homosexuals but just transvestites. This is an extremely cooky little film that often times gets called one of the worst ever made but that's so far from the truth because movies that are among the worst ever made and never this entertaining. What makes this film so surreal is the fact that it comes off campy yet every single scene in the movie is trying to be so heartfelt and serious that the viewer just has to sit there and not believe what's going on in front of his eyes. You can tell that Wood was so serious in trying to get people to understand him and this is made even clearer by the director playing the role and Glen and Glenda. Wood's screenplay contains his usual off the wall dialogue, which while silly, is certainly entertaining. Wood always tries to be poetic with his dialogue and he manages to do so but at the same time this stuff is so out there that you can never take it too serious. Then, of course, you have Bela Lugosi playing some sort of scientist yet it's pretty clear he's suppose to be a God-like being. What can you really say about Lugosi? Sure, it's rather sad in a funny way to see someone like him in a movie like this but that just adds to the film's surreal charm. I must say that even though his dialogue is downright silly, Lugosi, always the professional, does a good job in his role. I'm not sure if Lugosi actually knew what the film was going to be about but that fire and passion is still there for us to watch. Wood, the actor, isn't the best thing around but he's certainly no worse than what we usually see in a movie like this. Dolores Fuller, future songwriter for Elvis, plays Glen's girlfriend and does a pretty bad job but she does give us plenty of laughs. Lyle Talbot and Timothy Farrell are also on hand so more laughs here. When it's all said and done, there's no doubt this is a bad movie yet it's very original and I'd even go a step further and say that it has a surreal nature about it that makes it strangely entertaining throughout.

The reason is that in all the film Ed Wood tries to say to the audience that be a transvestite is not a real problem because he has that problem.I admire a lot Ed Wood because he loves movies and he could direct, act and watch how his dream became trues, and i think that undependable of his films, he is an example to all the people that want to be some day a director (i include myself in that persons) because it is true that Ed Wood had no talent but the way he makes films just because he loves that is truly an example.More about the film well just that Bela Lugosi plays a very strange but funny role, because he say the phase pull the string like 5 times and well what is he, a science man or a doctor????????? Only Mr. Ed Wood knows. Conclusion If you want to be director or if you loves films, you must see Ed Wood's films that now are true cult films.

It really is unbelievable how a person can write a script like this, nothing in it really makes sense and is just plain weird. I've also read the script (before watching this movie actually) and reading it makes even less sense. Yes, Ed Wood really is the worst writer of movie history.There are some very weird scene's that seems to have nothing to do with the movie such as all of the Bela Lugosi scene's. What or who was his character even supposed to be? Even worse are the just plain weird dialogs he has to speak with his trademark horrible accent. I'm talking about line's such as Beware! Beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep. He eats little boys... Puppy dog tails, and BIG FAT SNAILS... Beware... Take care... Beware! Which is repeated countless times throughout the movie, in all kinds of variations. Or what to think of the line Pull the string! Pull the string! while a pack of wild bison's run through the screen...talking about weird! At one point in the movie there are some erotic tinted scene's that absolutely don't make any sense to me. No wonder Wood in his final years ended up making hardcore porn movies such as Necromenia.Dolores Fuller really is an horrible actress. Perhaps the worst I've ever seen in a movie. She delivers her lines like an 9 year old would and I think by saying this I'm offending some 9 year old now...Still you have to give some credit to this movie. As a documentary about transvestism it really isn't a that bad movie, especially not for its time. If the movie had been completely been made in documentary style it would even perhaps have been a classic. You have to give some credit for what Ed Wood tries to achieve with this movie, which is also based loosely on his own life as transvestite. You can tell by watching this movie that it had been made with lot's of ambition.Like all Ed Wood movies, it's so bad that it actually becomes good.3/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Plan 9 from Outer Space was better","Date":"21 September 2005","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" My 10/10 rating is of course for Ed Wood enthusiasts. For everyone else, Glen or Glenda is ridiculous. I personally preferred Plan 9 from Outer Space. Anyway, GOG tells the story of transvestite Glen (Ed Wood). The most interesting scenes are Bela Lugosi as the narrator. Most of the movie makes no sense at all. If anything, it's just interesting to see how Ed Wood got his start. But I was surprised that IMDb.com was only able to identify one revealing mistake; it seems like an Ed Wood movie should have one in every scene (although I wasn't able to identify any).Anyway, the movie is full of bad dialogue, and everything else that one expects in an Ed Wood movie. Lovably idiotic.

Glen or Glenda, however, is a painful and tedious disaster and - no matter how good Wood's intentions were - it's a strong contender for the title of worst movie ever made. Wood attempts to give a documentary-style portrait of the minds and feelings of transvestites. Pivot character is a young man (played by Wood himself under a pseudonym) who's about to marry a girl that doesn't yet know he also likes to dress up as a woman. The character and voice-over constantly ramble moralistic speeches they can hardly handle while the substance most of the time is completely beside the point (Flying?? If God wanted us to fly, he would have given us wings!) Wood himself is a lousy actor and when he's dressed up as a woman the unintended comedy effect truly kicks in. He's one ugly broad! Yet, the ONE aspect that makes Glen or Glenda really unendurable is a senile looking Bela Lugosi constantly interfering with pointless nagging and tricky grimaces. God only knows what he's talking about (green dragons, puppets on strings...) and why!?!

It is obvious that Ed Wood was a very disturbed man struggling with being a transvestite. But do I really want to watch him star in such a painful to watch film? Not really. Instead, I actually felt rather sorry for him--not just because of his fetish to wear women's clothing but because his earnest plea for understanding will only elicit laughter because of its inept script, acting and directing. It's sort of like looking at circus freaks and laughing--you know some will but you hope you are a better person than that. Instead, try to watch the other dreadful films he made in the 1950s (before he got into making low-budget porn) for a giant laugh.
