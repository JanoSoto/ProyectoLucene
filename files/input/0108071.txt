I have probably seen it a dozen times, and I never get tired of it. Everything about it is perfect it's well-directed, well-acted, beautifully filmed, has great music, and the script and story are wonderful.Agneiszka Holland does an outstanding job directing this film. Each character is separate and unique; each one has little personality quirks that makes it seem real. Just about every scene in the movie includes children, animals, or both -- which must have been a nightmare to coordinate. Ms. Holland pulls it off without a hitch. Everything melds perfectly, and we are transported to a distant place and time, and fall in love with real, human characters. The primary three characters in this story -- Mary Lennox, Colin Craven, and Dickon -- are all children, played by actors who are around 10 years old. Ordinarily having one child in a movie is difficult enough, but again, somehow they pull it off. All three kids -- especially Kate Maberly -- do a fine job of acting, and they are quite credible. Kate is simply divine as Mary Lennox, and Heydon Prowse was a good counter-point to her as Colin.The story is touching and charming, and I think you'd have to be almost inhuman not to have a tear in your eye by the end of it. I absolutely fell in love with these children, and came to care very much about their characters. The secret garden really does seem to be a magical place (and I will say no more about it, since otherwise that would spoil things), and at the end I found myself wishing I could go and visit it first-hand. The accompanying music is wonderful -- I find myself humming it for days and days after watching it.In short, everything comes together to make this film a masterpiece. It is easily one of the 10 or 12 best movies ever made, perhaps *the* best movie ever made. I love it so much that I went out and bought the DVD of it, even though I'd seen it 8 or 10 times already. If you have not seen it I give it my highest possible recommendation. My score 10/10.

Heydon Prowse is good, too, as Colin, and so is Maggie Smith as Mrs. Medlock, the frusterated, overprotective housekeeper who seems to be mean, but really is only doing what she thinks best.

Too often directors spoil the story with their own self-interested spin (Little Big Man and Chocolat come immediately to mind)but here is a jewel that leaves the viewer saying That was as good as the book. A genuine triumph.The cast is outstanding, the children in particular, Kate Maberly as Mary Lennox above all. Even to the most minor extra everyone brings a smooth and compelling reality to the story.However, the real star is director Agnieszka Holland. Against a challenging climate ( a rainy location) she manages to create a movie with a touching commentary on how children can literally change the world. Her insightful grasp of the themes of isolation, growth and rejuvenation, the need for a balance between nurture and allowable risk are all managed through the controlling metaphor of a garden. The artful rendering of these literary themes are what many directors apparently find most challenging ( I'm looking at you Arthur Penn)and generally blissfully ignore them compensating by glib insertions, extra action or clumsy sentiment. Not so here.Not only is her focus exemplary but the photography is amazing. The interplay of light and dark, the time elapse photos of clouds rolling and flowers emerging all set to beautiful music captivate the viewer. The rainy weather was not shunned but used to fullest effect. I can only imagine the discipline it must have taken to wait for the sun to peep out from the clouds and then roll film hoping that the cast can pull off the shot before the light changed and a second take became a long wait. Fortunately all are up to the task and the film, the final scene in particular, results in a brilliant piece of motion picture art.The 1993 version of The Secret Garden is a must for every family film collection, one the parents and kids can enjoy for its sophistication or simply for the great way in which this timeless classic is retold.

As a single father of two children, boy and girl, I look far and wide for movies that will allow me to provide good, wholesome family time...without the fear of foul language issuing forth, foul gestures, or all-too-typical South Central L.A. ghetto demeanor being exhibited by punkish personalities. And unfortunately too many Hollywood child actors are nowadays forced to lower their personal ethics for inappropriate movie roles in our never ending averaging-down of America.The Secret Garden dismisses the need to add token actors of every type (a.k.a. Disney's last unbelievable rendering of Annie - TV 1999), race and sexual dysfunction to it's cast. Movies once were special beautiful places where the best actors were chosen for the part, and where viewers could easily lose themselves and for a short time become something in their mind's eye that was wonderful and magical. This is such a film. It's cast is well chosen for the story, not for current day hypocrisy. The Secret Garden allows viewers to immerse in a world larger than themselves ease and without having to keep saying...now why is THAT person in the movie...or why does THAT person have to keep making obscene gestures or engage in a constant flow of obscene sexual double-entendres? This movie is pure of heart. It is one of one of Hollywood's finest creations. Kate Mayberly as Mary Lennox is convincing. Her entry into the film is as a 10 year old girl who is catered hand and foot, literally, bathed and dressed by Indian nannies, then ignored by her parents. She grew to feel pampered, unloved and unwanted, and without the training to even dress herself. This is a sobering cameo to any parent, of how not to 'raise' a child.The Secret Garden has been re-made many times, in books, in the theatre, in movies...and several reasons for the sudden death of Mary's parents are provided. The manner of their death is utterly unimportant, for it is the rest of the movie in which the magic of love and acceptance blossoms, and the viewer's anticipation grows as surely as does Mary's own heart and personal demeanor, and as a perfect reflection of the new growth of her formerly abandoned and neglected aunt's garden.Kate Mayberly is beautiful. She is an exceptionally talented young actress.My family has enjoyed shedding a few tears along with her character, Mary Lennox during the many times we've viewed The Secret Garden, and we have learned a bit more about the value of caring...and about the power of love.To anyone considering purchasing The Secret Garden as a family film, do it. There are no downsides here, no parts where a parent has to cover his child's eyes or ears. The Secret Garden is the perfect family film.

One aspect of this film which I loved was Andrew Knott as Dickon, who ultimately sublimated his love for Mary to help Colin in the grand tradition of the English Hero - the common man. As in the Lord of the Rings, it is not a Jedi Knight, or a superman or muscleman or gun-slinging cowboy who is the hero, it is one of the common folks who rises to the occasion when greatness is demanded by the times and situation. As did Sam Gamgee, the Hero of the LOTR, so does Dickon stand out as an almost mythical personification of love and sacrifice for the good of others with no thought of recompense. This is what I love about classic English novels, how the average guy can change the world, if he loves it enough. Wonderful stuff.

The atmosphere in this movie is perfectly portrayed as being sinister and dark and I remember being 8 watching this movie and feeling the oppressive feeling of Lord Craven's mansion. Mary Lennox is a 10 years old English girl who was raised in India. She didn't like to live in India, but the thing she hated the most was the fact that her parents were selfish and never cared about her. One day, an Earthquake in India makes a big devastation and many kids stay orphan,including our lead character Mary Lennox. She is sent to England, to live in her uncle's mansion,since he is now her legal guardian. Mary, which is a cold,bitter,annoying girl who hates to be touched and with lots of angry inside her, meets Martha, a cool girl and servant who works in the mansion and treats Mary very nice( the opposite of Mrs. Medlock,the governess) and her brother Dickon, a sweet boy who makes friendship with the animals. One day,Mary discovers in her aunt's room a key. But it's not an ordinary key, is the key from the secret garden, a garden who once was the place where her aunt always loved to stay and that now is locked since she died. Mary ask Dickons to help her to restore the garden,but they both make it a secret. In the meanwhile, Mary meets her cousin Colin, a sick and spoiled boy who stayed all his life in bed, since everybody always believed he would die very young. It's beautiful to see the changes of Colin and Mary He learns to be more confident and less pessimist, changing the paranoia of being all the time confined in his bedroom because of 'spores', to go to the garden and try to walk again.

As silly as that sounds, the movie really got our imaginations going. Of course you grow up and you forget a little bit about the movies that you used to watch as a kid. But I was looking at the five dollar bin at Wal Mart and found The Secret Garden, I figured since I hadn't seen it in a while that I could check it out once again and still I think I have a special love for this magical story about bringing life back into a dead world.The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in India to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor. Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother Dicken, a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life. Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock, discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform magic, and make the garden live again.The Secret Garden is always going to hold a special place in my heart, I absolutely adore this film and it brings back so many wonderful memories from my childhood. The children that they found to play Mary, Dicken and Colin were absolutely perfect and were great actors actually, I'm surprised they didn't move onto bigger things in their careers, but they had great chemistry and really brought the movie to life. The settings are gorgeous, the garden that the children created was so lovely and reminds me about all the wonderful things that spring brings, life.

Sets and scenery were awesome, but the pacing moved much too quickly, giving no time for reflection on the core issues of loneliness and pain.  Kate Maberly's acting was at times alive, but overall not nearly as intense as the Mary Lennox of the book.  And the transition from spoiled brat to humble, glowing and excited girl was never really evident.  Dickon's character is good, but the romantic triangle implied with Colin is ridiculous and foreign to the relationships in the book. Mrs. Sowerby is totally overlooked (a critical role in the story as a healer, and the source of Dickon's and Martha's joy of life) and Mrs. Medford is made out to be too much of a villain.  The tribal dance does violence to the original story's quest for supernormal help -- in the book they sing the Doxology, for goodness' sake!  That wouldn't be politically correct now, I suppose.  Overall, it was a charming, beautifully picturesque movie, but the unnecessary departures from the real story left me unsatisfied.  On to the other versions & hope for the best.

Here, she keeps to herself and finds an old garden and brings it back to life with the help of the staff and a young boy named Dicken. She comes to meet her cousin, the lil brat Colin, and teaches him to walk again despite being told he's unable to. The garden is apparently magical, but in a realistic way. There's no fairy dust or other such nonsense. It's just allowing people to believe in themselves and be happy. The music is touching as are the relationships of the characters. Colin wanting to marry her despite their 1st cousin status was a little too much for me, but didn't cause a break in the movie. I wished they had shown what she looked like as a grown up instead of avoiding her face, but I guess that's to keep her forever young in our minds. The mean maid (whose name i forget she was in Sister Act) provided a challenge to Mary, but nothing she couldn't handle and eventually won her over. Mary was a royal brat at first, but only cuz she didn't know how else to be since her parents were self-involved. I was glad to see her come out of it. Dicken was such a cool kid, I loved him a lot. He was smart without having to go to school for it and was just loveable and helpful. In other versions, he and Mary were supposed to get together, but he died in some war and she took up with Colin. I really liked him though. Colin was a sicly kid who they constantly fussed over and he was snotty to show for it. He calmed down a little too, but could still be a royal pain. He was temperamental and that was annoying, but that was his character. The father, Lord Craven, was only emotionally unattached because his wife died in childbirth and he thought his son wasn't able to be healthy and he would just run away. How English of him, lol. The garden was absolutely beautiful and gorgeous. Made you wanna be a kid again and just frolick around in it. All the animals and plants were inviting. It seemed simplistic and a good place to be.

Mary is a plain-looking ten year old child who was raised in India. She was all but completely ignored by her self-absorbed parents and put under the care of ayahs, who indulged her in order to keep her from bothering her parents. She had no friends or playmates of her age, so she never experienced the give and take of interacting with other children. Thus, she grew to the age of ten generally helpless, unable to care for herself, demanding, and lacking in basic social skills. Contrary to some critical opinions, Mary isn't so much nasty-bratty as haughty-arrogant. But she had a seemingly insatiable thirst for learning, and the capacity and wisdom to read and understand the ways of her world. And she had a driving will to achieve her goals. She also was able to recognize and appreciate offers of friendship and love from whatever source. (SPOILERS)Considering the depth and power given her character by author Burnett in the first half of the story of The Secret Garden, it's ironic that with the introduction of Colin Craven, her cousin, Mary seems to be elbowed out of the way in favor of a bigger emphasis on Colin's story line. Indeed, in the original story and most of its movie incarnations, she isn't even given the privilege of sharing in the dramatic ending where Colin and his estranged father are at last united. It's especially ironic in light of the fact that it was through Mary's efforts that the garden and its magic were resurrected, Colin grew strong, and the reconciliation of Colin and his father was enabled. The Secret Garden is not Mary's story; however, it's the story Mary made possible. (SPOILER)Director Agnieszka Holland, a devoted admirer of the original novel, understood Mary's importance, and brought the story around in a full circle to end in the scene where Lord Craven, Colin's father, gives Mary her deserved recognition. You brought us back to life, Mary, he tells her. So this movie starts with an arrogant child throwing her name at you, not caring whether you like her or not, and it ends with a messiah who learned how to cry.The whole cast was great, especially the children Heydon Prowse (Colin) and Andrew Knott (Dickon) and especially, especially Kate Maberly who played Mary with such power and depth. Also, recognition should go to Maggie Smith as the intimidating Mrs. Medlock, John Lynch as Colin's somber bereft father Lord Craven, and to Laura Crossley for her heart-warming portrayal of the bright, sensitive, humble Martha.

They were children and knew they could create whatever colors they wanted wherever they wanted, with beautiful flowers. So the fact that Mary was from exotic India, and that Colin has never seen his dad and was desperate, the magic scene was a welcomed idea for them...an honest attempt in the story to delve into what would kids do? scenarios....   What I find interesting about this brief but engaging magic insert (1)It is a metaphor for international respect. Throughout the whole movie, Mary is trying to urge Colin to be open-minded, but he thinks all her India stories are stupid. The fact that Colin was the one chanting in the end (and that the magic actually worked) shows a change of heart in him for foreign things; and  (2) The fact that this garden was so beautiful it hardly looked real was accented by this magic scene. The garden WAS real, but perhaps there was some magic involved to make it so enchanting. It just helps you think in more supernatural terms(to make it more engaging) than just a 19th century story in England about a girl who can plant seeds in a garden.      ------------END   SPOILER--------------Watch this movie and create a garden of you own !-Sep  "}{"Title":"This movie is fine but it has very little to do with the real story","Date":"12 April 2008","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" The acting is very good, the scenery is lovely, the filming is well done, but where did this story come from?

I appreciate this attitude very much how people are never really evil, only a bit sickened.All characters and actors are really fine, but I want to lose a few more words about Mary Lennox. It's an extremely well-written character for a child and this allows Kate Maberly to carry the movie, make us want to accompany her. Originally, she actually is *egotistic*, but maybe only thus she can find her way and make things right. You'll find her cheeky, you'll like her and you'll understand her.There is much more to say about the picturesque garden, music, friendships, attitudes and so forth... I'll leave it with my above feelings and thoughts. (If you know the movie, you'd find that I'm ignoring pretty much)Because I'm *cynical*, it doesn't make the 10 so 9 out of 10, then!

Kate Maberly is perfect as the cold, sour little Mary who blossoms inside just like her garden, and there is more fine youthful casting in Heydon Prowse as the spoiled, fragile Colin, Andrew Knott as the gentle-natured Dickon, and Laura Crossley as sweet, talkative Martha. Maggie Smith is fantastic as usual as the stern Mrs. Medlock, and John Lynch gives a haunting performance as the nerve-shattered Lord Craven.It is rare to find family entertainment that is clean, well-scripted, and visually stunning, but this movie fits the bill perfectly. It is a timeless movie that captures the spirit and quality of the timeless story it is adapted from!

This is my favorite production of the Secret Garden that I have seen. The acting is superb and the scenery and soundtrack are amazing. The music is haunting and beautiful, I honestly cannot praise it enough. This movie deviates from the book somewhat, but truthfully I think that I like the movie better. I really enjoyed Kate Maberly's portrayal of Mary, she was the perfect combination of charming and sullen. In the book I found Mary very unlikeable throughout, but in this movie Kate was able to make her rude and spoiled (of course she would be with her upbringing)but also she made you have sympathy for Mary, and even like her as she grew as a character and became less irritating. Of course I love that Maggie Smith is in this (how can you not love her?) even if she is the bad guy. Overall, this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. I loved it as a child, and enjoy it as an adult. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

The Secret Garden sees Mary Lenox (Kate Maberly), a 10-year-old British girl who was born in India. She is a spoiled brat who has her own personal servant, but is emotionally distance because she was neglected by her parents. But after a massive Earthquake in India, Mary is orphan and sent back to England to live with her uncle. The Northern English manor is run by a harsh matriarch, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith) and limits Mary's access to most of the house. But Mary forms friendships with the servant girl Martha (Laura Crossley) and her brother Dickon (Andrew Knott) who has great animal taming abilities, discovers her aunt's secret garden and finds her 'sick' cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse).The Secret Garden does share similarities to A Little Princess, both feature young girls who grew up in India, have lost their parents in some form, both are forced to go to move to a foreign land, have to deal with an authoritarian figure, befriends a servant girl and there is a character who has a magical element to him. But there are differences as well the main one being the central characters Mary is a more selfish, spoiled character who has to learn to open up, show emotions, be kind and help her people whilst Sara in A Little Princess has to keep her imagination and kind spirit despite the hardships and lost she suffered. The actual story and setting for both stories is also different with Mary having to help to her cousin, lead to have a passion and learn about her family's past.In comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders.As well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music.The cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances. Many of them have gone on to have fairly successful careers beyond the film and brought out the interesting aspects from their characters. I personally thought Maberly was actually a better actress then Eleanor Bron was in A Little Princess and she did give a very emotional performance in that film. Smith is also a very formable present, as she is always is, and have very strange motivations to why she is treating Colin the way she does? Is it out of crudity, love or protection? It is up to the audience.The Secret Garden is a very good and strong family film that is serious minded and old-fashioned, but in a good away. I personally preferred The Secret Garden to A Little Princess and I speak as a fan of Alfonso Cuaron.

I never read the classic children's novel it's based on by English author Frances Hodges Burnett, however this film quickly had me absorbed from the first time I viewed it theatrically when it was first released in 1993. The photography and musical score are excellent, adding much mood and emotion to the story.The story concerns a 10 year old English girl named Mary, living in India with her neglectful parents. Her parents are killed in an earthquake and she moves to her uncle's manor in the English countryside. When Mary first arrives at her new home, she is an angry, sour and defiant child. This large and gloomy manor does not seem to hold any promise as a happy place to live, however, there are surprises in store, that change Mary for the better.From direction, to casting, to acting, to film editing, to photography and music score, this film is just about perfect. Even upon later viewings, I find myself smiling and crying throughout this film. This is partly due to my fondness for children and animals to be sure. The mood and feeling of this film really captures a child's perspective convincingly. The Secret Garden published in 1911, is one of author Burnett's later works in life and is her most enduring novel.Another famous and popular Burnett novel Sarah Crewe was made into a play A Little Princess and a theatrical film of the same name released in 1995. A Little Princess of 1995, is an excellent film also and certainly ranks as a major favorite film to me. Comparisons between the two films are inevitable not only because of being based on novels by the same author but their proximity in time when released (2 years). A Little Princess 1995, may have more dazzling photography and production design than A Secret Garden 1993, from a solely artistic film making viewpoint, but A Secret Garden is a wiser story, that even exceeds the charm and heartwarming feeling of the A Little Princess 1995.

The garden is walled off - abandoned, locked, hidden behind ivy - the physical counterpart to its unhappy owner. Only the robin knows what lies behind its walls. Into this lonely setting made ever more memorable by the film's haunting music, stunning photography, superb cast, and outstanding direction, steps Mary Lennox - a sour, spoilt little girl, orphaned in India where both her parents died. But at Mislethwaite, she begins to discover not only her gloomy physical surroundings; in doing so, she also learns to appreciate something about the others who live there - Martha, the little maid sent to help her; the fierce housekeeper, Mrs Meddlock; Dickon - the boy on the moors with his gift for communicating with animals; and Colin - the mysterious source of crying at night that everyone at least initially else dismisses as the wind blowing across the moors or another maid's toothache. Finally, Mary begins to discover little by little something much more valuable about herself and others through the transformations that begin to take place from the secret garden as well as from her relationships at Mislethwaite.This is very much a film about personal discovery and personal growth set against the bleak background of moorland, mists, and the gloomy interiors of Mislethwaite. The film strongly suggests that some form of magic intervenes to make possible the processes of discovery and ultimately, healing. And it is not only Mary who makes discoveries - so too do Colin and Lord Craven, and to a lesser extent, the others at Mislethwaite.The tantrums, outbursts of temper and sulking which all figure so prominently in the story might lead some to suppose that this is primarily a film for and about children. But the story is a sensitive exploration not only of childhood but also of human relationships on a general level. It functions as a sort of magic carpet that whisks us off to realms in which we might just possibly recognise fleeting glimpses of ourselves. As such, some might classify The Secret Garden along with The Railway Children (1970) - an elegy about personal discovery, development and healing within the more general contexts of a therapeutic environment and learning how to live with other people.

Casting, direction, location, photography, wardrobe--on and on--all 10s. One of the great elements is the 'contrariness' of the lead girl, caused by her parents' neglect, which allows children to view a less than rosy child in a less than rosy childhood, as all are. The details of Victorian child & medical management are grim without being overwhelming. Maggie Smith's portrayal of a harried, prejudiced, socially obtuse woman who nevertheless struggles to do her duty, and who is then revealed to be a decent soul at the end--it's wonderful. She leads us to understand that villains can have complex motivations, some of them cultural, as with the vicious class system. Best of all, these elements are infused in the sub-text, just like reality, so no child can miss them. Magnificent!

It is flawlessly directed by Agnieszka Holland, who is possibly the best female director of all time.  Besides boasting three marvelous child actors in the lead roles, it also has exquisite cinematography and a screenplay that never goes for the obvious.Holland is a master at eliciting eccentric and unconventional performances from her actors to create one-of-a-kind characters, from Leonardo DiCaprio's strange but interesting portrayal of Arthur Rimbaud in Total Eclipse to Jennifer Jason Leigh's shy and awkward heiress in Washington Square.  The performances in The Secret Garden are just as intriguing, particularly the part of Martha, the eccentric maid.  The young girl who plays the lead is remarkable.  Everything about this film is just right, right down to the way the leaves blow in the wind.  It's just a wonderful film.

Despite the Industrial Revolution and the consequent leaps and bounds of technological progress childbirth and womens' health was very much a side issue in a patriarchal society.Colin's father has no interest in his son's upbringing despite - or,arguably,because of the fact that his wife,whom he clearly loved had died giving birth to the boy.He is an intelligent man and knows that such an attitude is not reasonable,but it is the status quo for a man of his position .That he loves and understands children is made clear by his attitude towards Mary and his defence of her against Mrs Medlock,but his gender and his own upbringing are not easy forces for him to overcome. And Mary is not an immediately attractive child.Orphaned by an earthquake in India,she is sent to England,where she has never been,to live with her uncle,bereaved husband of her dead mother's late sister. So spoilt and mollycoddled that she is unable even to dress herself,she soon comes into conflict with her cousin's governess/nurse/minder Mrs Medlock,and her cousin himself,an apparently sickly boy,bedridden,self-pitying and petulant.How she changes the lives of the boy,her uncle and Mrs Medlock is told in The Secret Garden. It is a film made with loving care and attention.Every set-up is beautifully composed,perfectly colour-balanced and lit . The shot where Mary looks longingly out of the window is stolen from Sophie Anderson's No Walk Today and that is not meant as a criticism. The secret garden itself could have been painted by Helen Allingham. The long lingering close-ups of Mary's face,her eyes and hair superbly lit,recollect the almost mythologising aspect of Victorian child portraiture.Perhaps it takes a European director to reveal the potential for real beauty in the long hallways,sweeping staircases and secret passages in an English manor house.British filmmakers are often too concerned with post-colonial guilt and wracked with naive ideas of class conflict to give a balanced picture of life in Victorian England. The fact that Dickon is very much a village boy and several social strata below Mary and Colin is never referred to in the film. Instead he is depicted as a child of nature,almost a gypsy,born to country ways and in almost Buddhist-like commune with wild animals. The last scene,a tremendous long shot where he rides off over the moors on his white horse has a fine mythic echo to it. It would take a colder heart than mine to turn aside from the redemption through innocence proposition that is at the centre of The Secret Garden "},{"Title":"Should have been a massive hit!","Date":"19 June 2005","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" The Secret Garden is easily one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching.

It is a gothic tale which miraculously transforms itself into a pastoral idyll. For once, we enjoy the intoxicating experience of seeing unhappy people find love and bliss, instead of watching happy people meet their disillusionment. What's more, the principal characters are children, who, in an odd twist, are able to mature only because they've found the bliss of being young. Like Mike Newell's Enchanted April, The Secret Garden celebrates the curing effects of the natural world and the possibility of human beings rediscovering (or discovering) their sense of contentment. It dares us to consider that our existence has a magical component that we cannot articulate. The film's lavish photography and beautiful landscaping serve to underscore these themes, as does the soulful celtic soundtrack. It is simply impossible to watch these children and not be moved to thankfulness for own humanity, however flawed it may be.

And I never read the book (probably didn't even know that it was even based on a book at the time). For years, I initially had no interest in seeing it. That is, until I first came across the animated version of this that aired as part of the ABC Weekend Specials and I was curious enough to check out (which I did on Youtube) and enjoyed it. A few months later and earlier this year, I decided to search for and watch this live action version on Putlocker and enjoyed it just as much. This is another one I've since added to the What have I been missing? list. I guess somehow I not only underrated this, but underestimated it as well. I consider this to be among the best or greatest family films of all time. For several years, I didn't know there were any other live action adaptations of the book and I wouldn't discover them until I came across them online. I haven't seen Hallmark's T.V. movie rendition nor the first live action one from 1949, but I'd like to see those too, though I want to see Hallmark's first, once I'm finally able to find it and stream online. From what I've read about it, this may be truer to its source and maybe even the truest out of all these film/T.V. remakes, but I'm partial to this and the ABC Weekend Special.Without much further ado, onto the points I'm making about this. It is absolutely fantastic, spectacular. Following her parents' deaths, a girl named Mary Lennox is sent away from India to England to live with her uncle and his son in a mansion. But little does Mary know after she arrives there, she's about to be in for a surprise A different kind of garden that isn't run-of- the-mill, a garden she's never seen before, a garden that's full of magic and marvel. The titular place that is the central focus of the story, it has the special powers of healing and rejuvenation. The role it plays involves some other things, but I don't want to give away too much more. I can see why the story is among the most beloved of all time. It has some nice, tender, mostly wholesome moments, then of course, there's the enchantment of the garden. It may be one of the most creative tales ever written. To everyone who hasn't already seen this, don't sleep on it like I did. I wish I had checked it out sooner. Everything about it is well done, from the writing to the acting to the cinematography to the music. It's just great all around. To find out more about it, y'all have got to see for yourselves.

It's a slim novel almost entirely lacking in incident and action; rather, it's a mood piece, designed to bring to life a magical place and the characters who inhabit it. This 1993 adaptation tries hard to do justice to the book, but the results are mixed.I was pleased to see that although this was an American-made film, the entire cast are British. However, the actors are a mixed bag, and for a lot of the time they struggle with a sub-par script that makes the kids annoying. Yes, Mary was bratty in the book, but she never felt irritating like she does here. I didn't much care for Maggie Smith's poor Yorkshire accent either, although Walter Sparrow (ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES) is excellent as the gardener.Some parts of THE SECRET GARDEN are very good, like everything featuring the robin (I have the horrible suspicion that a modern version would simply CGI the bird) and the scenes that actually stick close to the book (and have the same dialogue in some cases). But in the effort to make the subject matter more cinematic, everything has to be bigger and grander, with random stone ruins within the garden. It was much smaller scale in the book, and some of the magic is lost. Also, they add in extraneous stuff like the stupid magic ritual, and Colin's father is NOTHING like he was in the book.

I was seven years old when I first watched The Secret Garden. Everything seemed more real then, the beauty, the yearning, the fear. But unlike many films that have faded into memory over time, this is one that has grown stronger and more real to me.The character of Mary Lennox (played by Kate Maberly) doesn't begin as the most friendly of people. She is a product of her environment, a bratty, demanding girl who can't imagine anything much beyond getting her way. But don't let that get in the way of identifying with her. Her journey throughout The Secret Garden is one of great inner discovery. It's the wondrous power of adventure that brings her out of herself, the understanding that no one will look out for her. Much like the character of Tyler in Never Cry Wolf she has a lot to learn about the power of solitude. It makes me wonder how many people in this world could gain something from time spent alone.The Secret Garden taught me about the sense of wonder. As the story progresses, things feel more and more magical. Zbigniew Preisnerhas composed a soundtrack that feels like leaves blowing, raindrops falling. He fills the garden itself with a world of beauty, a powerful field of growing music. There is a key scene of time lapse images when the Spring flowers first make their way out of the ground. I love this film with all my heart, from the power of silence to the strength of images (by cinematographer Roger Deakins). Some films are beautiful because they're so real.

What irked me at the start was that they chose to kill people off in an earthquake and not with the Cholera. The earthquake seemed pretty cheesy to me then. (The tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was more realistic.) The reason given by the director and screenwriter was that no one these days knows what Cholera is. Ironically, the week after the movie premiered, there was an earthquake in India and people were worried about Cholera breaking out. As a child reading this book cover to cover so many times that I wore out a copy, the fear of a fever and infectious disease that could get anyone was much scarier than the threat of an earthquake. The child playing Mary wasn't sour at all. She was cranky, and shrill. I never felt sorry for her. Dickon was an afterthought. He is what Mary wants to emulate. She even picks up on his Cockney speech (well, his and Ben Wetherstaff). They completely neglect the Martha/Mary/Mrs. Sowerby story. Here is a woman with more mouths than she can feed herself, and she takes Mary, the sour little yellow orphan into her heart and prayers. It is she who gets Archibald to the Manor upon her pleas that this motherless child need love and warmth. There was so much time spent on the cinematography, that true, joyous parts of this book were lost. When Mary calls Colin (That's COLIN, not KOLIN or COLLIN) a Rajah, he asks her to tell her what one is. That isn't in the book, but he behaves like a spoilt prince as they go outside. That's not the message in the book. In the book, he is a little more awkward and foolish about it. This Mary seems more annoyed at her cousin and his hump than defiant. Mary's defiance and determination in the book are what give Colin is gumption to get better. There is none of that in the book. It is a story of two spoiled only children who have to learn to live with someone else their age. There is also no mention of Colin taking pictures and getting jealous of Mary and Dickon in the book. It's an innocent story, why put a modern spin of heated tension between two kids? I do have to admit, seeing it again, that Sleezeball Gerry from Sliding Doors playing Uncle Archie was a bit of a treat. John Lynch is an underrated actor, and I hope to see him as a truly good guy someday. Dame Maggie was very good as the Icy Miss Metlock. I never liked the character, and I still don't. Well done. Someday, maybe before I pass on to my own garden, I will see a version that is truly faithful to the book, with great child actors (the 1949 version is hard to watch because even though the best child actors of the time are in it, they still seem wooden) who actually speak with British accents and a Mary who goes from crisp, Indian influenced British to Cockney. A version that gives us a Mrs. Sowerby and a scene in which Martha talks to her mother about the sour, little, girl. A Dickon who inspires Mary and Colin. While the book continues to run swells in my heart, no movie version of this book has done the same. Oh, and don't even get me started on the versions of A Little Princess.

Taken in by his uncle Lord Archibald Craven (Lynch) who has sorrowfully indulged in the loss of his wife since ten years ago an accident took her life (which actually happened in the garden, that's why Lord Craven ordered to close it forever), Mary is under rigid superintendency of Ms. Medlock (Smith), the stern housekeeper doesn't clearly doesn't care too much about her more than a thorn in the flesh. Mary is unhappy in her new environment, until she finds her aunt's garden, thanks to the guidance of a robin to show her the way (there must be magic involved!), at beginning, the garden seems dead, just like the solemn air in the hundred-room manor, with sporadic scream sounds from a young child which everyone dares not to mention. Holland has achieved a remarkable job to set the mood right, it is irresistibly captivating, even a tad spooky, which is reminiscent of the haunting ambiance in Jack Clayton's horror master work THE INNOCENTS (1961, 9/10). Soon, Mary discovers the secret behind the scream is from Lord Craven's 10-year-old son Colin (Prowse), who has been bed-ridden since he his premature birth (due to his mother's accident) and is treated as a fragile invalid ever since. Mary befriends with her new cousin, and she is destined to revive the garden and the family from the lifelessness which has been cloaking the entire place for too long.Kate Maberly is surprisingly laudable in her film debut to portray a young girl's leap from a sullen sport to an intrepid trailblazer in brining hope and wonder galore, harmoniously couples with the flourish nature's flow and fauna, what a natural chameleon she is! Her interactions with Heydon Prowse and Andrew Knott, who plays the farmer boy Dickon and can talk to animals, are much convincingly conveyed with an added layer of delicacy with both romance and jealous lurking around. Prowse also instigates a strong self-confidence rarely seen in a child actor in the confrontational scenes with Maggie Smith, their authority- juggling game may be a slip in the script, but certainly fun to behold in a movie as good- natured as this. Among the adults, Smith is breathtaking whenever she is on screen although she is playing her very stereotyped maiden calling card again, always something tender can be found under the harsh front. Whereas John Lynch solidly confers the peculiar 10-years lachrymal distress with adequate likelihood, which in a lesser hand, could be the weakest link in the fable. Made only two decades ago, now if we scrutinise the offerings pander to Generation Z, it is axiomatic that this film is a bona-fide gem beyond any comparison, particularly for its astonishing beauty created by its production team without the interruption of digitalised virtual reality and the unforced manner of how it imparts its positive messages on the viewers.

What I saw was beautiful and captivating, artistic and entrancing -- filmmaking of the highest order. The Secret Garden is a movie of such artistic quality that it ranks up there with the hallowed original Apocalypse Now (although they're totally different genres). It's no surprise that Francis Ford Coppola had his hand in both pics -- he was, of course, the director of Apocalypse Now and he's the executive producer of The Secret Garden. In any event, the cinematography is breathtaking and the score is awe-inspiring, ranking with the best in cinematic history.***PLOT SPOILER*** The story's about a spoiled 10-year old English girl, orphaned in India, who comes home to live on her uncle's vast estate in the early 1900s. The girl, Mary, finds herself trapped in a mysterious, colossal manor -- almost a castle -- tyrannically managed by a life-stifling witch, Mrs. Medlock, in the frequent absence of her uncle, Lord Cravin. Because Mary is intelligent, independent and sly she is able to reconnoiter the manor and learn its forbidding secrets. The biggest secret is that her aunt died ten years earlier and her son, Colin, still lives there, albeit confined to a bed, sickly and unable to walk. Her uncle never healed from this heartbreak.Mary discovers another secret in her explorations, a hidden garden, closed off and neglected since her aunt's death. After meeting the sickly and sad Colin, Mary inevitably finds a way to sneak him into the garden along with her pal Dickon. She senses that Colin isn't as sick as everyone is convinced; she knows the best thing would be to get him out of the dreary castle and the oppressive clutches of Mrs. Medlock. Mary and her secret garden are the keys to restoring health, life and freedom to Colin, Lord Cravin and the gloomy manor.***END SPOILER*** The Secret Garden is sort of a 1990's version of the outstanding Pollyanna with Hayley Mills (1960). Both pics involve a young girl restoring a spirit of joy and liberty to a lifeless community. The difference is that Mary is not even remotely the glad girl Pollyanna. In fact, look for the hilarious line from the old gardener who responds to Mary's puzzlement concerning her lack of friends.The Secret Garden is no doubt labeled a children's film, which is a shame because it transcends such a limiting category.

Yet in the middle, is the housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith) who uses her abilities to stop Mary from accomplishing her goal. And that is to keep poor Colin in bed. But through sheer determination and with the help of a young grounds keeper, Dickon (Andrew Knott). They all discover a secret garden which was supposed to be closed forever, until Mary and her unique green thumb re-creates the lush and beautiful landscape for which the manor is known for. This held all aspects of emotions, humour, innocence, sadness, anger, and above all, Love. This will give the home audience a unique perspective about how the will to live without bounds can over come the most difficult obstacles. The Secret Garden is a wonderful film on those nights where there is nothing to do, and it can show a family what a family is supposed to be about.

They didn't, or I don't think so anyway. If that was the case, that was the only thing they changed. The script is focused and the direction masterful. The book in my opinion is one of the most enchanting children's books ever written. The film is equally enchanting, and the director manages to spoof a spirited performance from the lovely Kate Maberly. Haydn Prowse was great as Colin, and John Lynch is suitably melancholy as the uncle. Stealing the show, however, was Maggie Smith as Mrs Medlock, the truly beastly housekeeper. The film itself looks beautiful thanks to the stunning cinematography, and I loved the Gothic darkness tone retained from the book. Another mention is the haunting and poignant music score, that makes me cry. What does work best of all is its simplicity though.

I decided to give it a view to see what condition it was in. I am glad I did. Although the video had deteriorated slightly it was still highly watchable, but this is clearly a movie that I need to upgrade to DVD.The Secret Garden is a little gem. It confirms something that one of my friends has been saying ever since he became a father and started watching movies with his daughter most of the best pictures being made these days are children's films. Few adult movies are as well crafted as this.The book seems to have been an obsession with the BBC. I first saw it in 1960, but by then there had already been two earlier versions (1949 and 1952) with further adaptations to follow in 1975 and 1987.As an eleven-year-old boy, I was embarrassed to be watching such a 'girly' programme and would have been humiliated if anybody had found out how enthralled I was, but by the time this movie came out I could watch it without any reservations.I immediately fell in love with Kate Maberly's Mary Lennox and my heart bled for the neglect and emotional privation that had created this sullen, imperious little madam. Maberly has had a successful career ever since and would probably be crestfallen to know that there are people like me who will always associate her with a performance she gave when she was still only ten. However, other performances are as good for example, Laura Crossley's scene-stealing Martha. And when has Maggie Smith ever been less than outstanding?The direction by Agnieszka Holland is spot on. I have just checked her credits and found that she was responsible for another overlooked movie that made an impression on me when I stumbled across it recently Copying Beethoven.It is beautifully shot, with some magical time-lapse photography, and has a great score.The screen play by Caroline Thompson is masterful. Again, I checked her credits and found she wrote three pictures for Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare before Christmas and The Corpse Bride 'nuff said.When I was eleven, the idea of a couple of kids tinkering about in a garden seemed rather soppy and was the principal cause of my unease, but of course I was missing the almost pagan symbolism of the garden, whose regeneration parallels the regeneration of Mary and Colin. Thompson puts this symbolism right at the heart of the story and underlines it with a beautiful scene in which Colin's impromptu fire ceremony summons his father back from the south of France. This is turn-of-the-century magical realism.Giving Mary a voice-over was also a good decision. It keeps the movie focused and allows Thompson to take us efficiently through the plot without any sense of being hurried along. However, I cannot help noting that the serialisations were often twice as long and this leaves me with a slight feeling of regret.Although this movie doesn't need to be any longer than its current 97 minutes, I would still have liked it to be a bit more expansive. There are a few areas where some follow through would have helped. For example, Colin's spasm of jealousy when he sees Mary on the swing with Dicken leads to nothing. This (and similar examples) are only minor quibbles that do not really impact on the effectiveness of the movie. The truth is that I simply want to spend more time with these entrancing characters. I wonder if there were any deleted scenes that would allow for an extended cut.My rediscovery of this timeless little classic will now send me out in search of the other Hodgson Burnett movie that came out shortly after this one The Little Princess.IMDb reviews suggest I have another treat in store for me.

I also thought the maid Martha did a very amusing and excellent job as the sweet, caring house maid.  And the garden scenes were just enchanting!  This film made me want to create my own enclosed secret garden too!  The landscape and design of it was just too divine.  Whoever created the illusion of that garden being dead and then being brought back to life certainly did a superb job. The only fly in the ointment in this film, for me, is the scene where the kids use magic to elicit Colin's father's return.  It seemed so devilish and obscene to see mere little children playing around with the occult--- it seemed to destroy their cute innocence and naivete. I fastforward the tape when it comes to that part. Of course, this is just a fiction anyway, but that's just how I look at it.

"},{"Title":"There is something to be said about the story of The Secret Garden when even such a skeletal film adaptation as this one can be so wildly entertaining.","Date":"18 February 2003","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  This version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden takes the novel and eliminates all but the most crucial elements to make sure the story makes sense, but there is so much left out from the book that it takes away a lot of the magic. Rather than have the garden act as a magical entity in itself, it is more of an escape from the creepy dreariness of Misselthwaite Manor, a gigantic monstrosity of a mansion that does justice to the enormity of the one portrayed in the novel but is such a brooding and unpleasant place that the escape of it overshadows the magical curiosity that should be entailed by the garden. The film creates a great sense of atmosphere, with the long hallways and the tremendously and unnecessarily elaborate living quarters that Mary is placed in, and we see some wonderful things as Mary sneaks around to explore the mansion, although she really only goes into one room and then her explorations are over.Kate Maberly delivers a wonderful performance as Mary Lennox, the spoiled little girl who is sent to live with her uncle, the reclusive Lord Craven, when her parents die of cholera in India, an event which never seems to affect her since her parents were always too busy for her anyway. Mary doesn't seem to care too much where she is being moved to beyond the fact that it is such an inconvenience for her, and she soon has to face the fact that she is no longer going to be waited on hand and foot like she was by her Ayah in India. Heydon Prowse also gives a great performance as Colin Craven, the young boy who is so extraordinarily spoiled that he has become literally incapable of caring for himself or even standing up. The young actors in this film are much more impressive than young actors often are (this is the kind of actor that is most likely to be forgiven for a bad performance because they're so darn cute), each portraying wonderfully the characters as they are presented in the novel. Andrew Knott as Dickon is the other major example, perfectly portraying the magical young boy who has a way with animals.The thing that makes the movie not compare to the novel is that there are some important things from the book that are left out of this film version, some of which I can understand being done for time purposes but there are some things that just should have been put in, in one way or another. There is nothing, for example, about the exercises that Colin indirectly learns from Bob Haworth in order to strengthen his legs, there's nothing about Colin's plans to become a scientist and an explorer and a lecturer (this kid wanted to be Indiana Jones and they didn't even mention it in the movie!), we see nothing of Colin's extravagant plans for how he should present his newfound health and strength to his father, there's very little said about the Magic that all three of them have found in the garden, and even Dickon's entire family (which is enormous in size as well as significance to the story) is left out entirely. These are just a few of the things that I noticed to be missing, and I'm sure the list goes on. The story itself is also hugely simplified, but if you take into consideration a film adaptation of something like Frankenstein, you can see that this could have been a lot worse. The 1933 film version of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel covered maybe 3-5% of the novel, which completely changed the meaning of the story and transformed Frankenstein's monster (Frankenstein is, of course, not the monster, but you already know that because you've read the book, right?) from an enormously intelligent creature who only wants to fit in to the world that he has been placed in and into a hulking, thoughtless beast. In this case, this version of The Secret Garden could have been a lot worse, but on the other hand, it could also have been a lot better, hence my conflict.For the most part, the story is here, which is a good thing. We know that the garden once belonged to and was loved by Lord Craven's wife, and we know that she died giving birth to Colin which is why Lord Craven locked up the garden forever and can scarcely stand even to look at his crippled son, who he fears will turn out to be a hunchback like himself (although neither of them look like hunchbacks at any time during the film). We briefly see Mary's life in India and we see a heavily diluted version of the part where she realizes what has happened to her parents, and then she is moved to Misselthwaite. The movie diverts from the book almost immediately, but mostly when Mary goes to Misselthwaite Manor. She is urged to go outside and explore by the endlessly patient Martha, and almost immediately runs into the secret garden. The grounds are bitterly cold and it's almost uncomfortable watching this portion of the film, which reminds me of other uncomfortable but wonderful films like Buffalo '66 and Affliction, but this is the sort of thing that replaces the real magic in the book. Rather than find the garden as a truly magical place, it is an escape from the dreariness of the rest of Misselthwaite. The robin is an important part of the story and it is found in the movie, but thankfully it is not presented quite as much as in the book. This is one of the only things that is fortunately subdued a little bit, since in the book the robin goes through a mating period and there is actually one chapter late in the novel where the robin and his mate have a conversation about Dickon and his strange friends, whom they're not too sure about. There are certainly some things from the novel that are left out of the movie with good reason, such as this scene where the narrative goes into the thoughts of the robins, which can only be disorienting and awkward unless it was done much earlier in the novel (and even then it would not have fit too well with the rest of the story). The ham-handed delivery of the moral at the beginning of Chapter 17 is also left out with good reason, but then there are little things changed as well, such as the simplification of the plot which takes away from the magic of the story as a whole, and even smaller things, like the fact that the command that Mary teaches Colin to tell her servants that he is done with them is changed from `You have my permission to go,' in the novel, to `I have spoken, all depart,' in the book. Did you ever see Sphere? That bad science fiction movie from 1998 that was based on the Michael Crichton novel? They did something similar in that movie, changing some of the names of the characters for no apparent reason. I can never understand why they would do things like that when making books into movies. On the one hand, I can understand that there are some books that could be made a lot better with a little tweaking here and there, but The Secret Garden is a classic novel that, with a few tweaks here and there, is most likely to be changed into a movie that could have been a lot better with a few small changes. Or, as it were, without a few small changes. This movie is sure to entertain and delight its target audience, but it should not be taken in place of the novel, which is hugely superior.I have spoken. All depart.

I had never read the book by Frances Hodgsen Burnett, but as a garden-lover, I had expected to enjoy it.The things that bothered me the most, however, were not the tedious story, but the anti-authority theme in the movie. I was surprised at the rudeness that Mary began with, and continued to use in her attitude towards adults in the household. She and Colin were rude to Mrs. Medlock and other adults who served them. And the magic scene, in which the children used a circling, chanting ceremony to summon Colin's father back, had a really sinister tone. There was a definite defiance in the way the children used this magic, in which there is nothing of the sort in the original book.When I read the book, which is an important and wonderful story, I realized my misgivings about this movie version were correct. The book was about children growing up healthy, unspoiled, well-loved, and full of faith. In this movie, the lessons of the book The Secret Garden are subtly twisted and manipulated into an angry, rebellious message that is a very different sort of story.

The thing I loved about Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic was that it was her only book that she didn't write about a perfect little kid who had to struggle &#150; The Secret Garden is about a imperfect, bratty little kid who had to struggle. But hey, I loved the book so that brings high expectations to the film &#150; and I was disappointed.For those illiterate people (I'm kidding) who do not know the story, the story beings with Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly), a spoiled little brat who lived in India with god-knows-how-many-servants who take care of her. Her parents do not care for her and instead they go to parties and enjoy themselves. One day a horrible earthquake hit India and many died, including Mary's parents.Mary is sent to live with her uncle (John Lynch), a heartbroken widow. The house is like a mansion, watched closely by Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith). While Mary goes searching around, she finds a secret garden, a garden that her uncle has locked up many years ago after his wives' death. Mary meets Dickon (Andrew Knott), the brother of one of the servants, Martha (Laura Crossley) who happen to talk with animals and helps Mary with the garden. Mary also meets her cousin Colin the son of her uncle who is isolated and alone, fearing death may come (like a smaller 1900s version of Woody Allen's character in Hannah and her Sisters).A huge problem of the film is that I find it impossible your average ten year old would enjoy the film. The film is slow and has a lot of moments where cute little kids run through corridors. The ending seems abrupt and kind of phony. Sometimes the dialogue even sound fake or just what adults think children would say to each other. In the book (excuse me for comparing film to book), Mary seems to really develop, while in the film, she just suddenly becomes a little angel. There are even moments in the book that Mary still seem a little bratty and probably haven't fully changed and in here, she just magically changes in the instant that she steps into the garden. Dickon, which I thought wasn't as likable in the movie as in the book (especially when he seems like he is harassing Mary in some scenes) &#150; I enjoyed book Dickon a lot better.Directed by Agnieszka Holland, it visually looks stunning but the screenplay written by Caroline Thompson disappoints me because it lacked the book's heroic spirit. There are some scenes that seemed so sudden, like a coincidence. There are a few likable moments in the film where you just smile and mentally wink at the screen, but nothing more. Overall, the film seemed like a drag, seeming longer than it really is. The acting is not superb and sometimes even over-the-top. Maggie Smith is actually quite good here, showing that she hasn't really aged since (watch the Harry Potter movies). "},{"Title":"Good movie.

It will be an unforgettable film and is delightful entertaining and moving. The story is about a spoiled ten year old girl named Mary Lennox (Kate Mayberly) who was born in a society family and lived in India. Her parents were selfish and wealthy partygoers who were too busy to spend time with her. She was raised by a servant who did everything for her. She hated India and the way her parent were. One day an earth quake hit and killed her parents and Mary Lennox (Kate Mayberly) was sent to England to live with her uncle Heydon Prowse (Colin Craven) in the countryside, Misselthwaite. It was a dreary castle that was closed off to the outside. She was introduced to a mean and dreadful and cold Mrs. Medlock who played the head servant. After she explored the castle, she met Colin Craven (Heydon Prowse) who was an invalid since birth and was pale and sickly, never leaving his bed. His mother died during childbirth from an accident in her garden, known as the secret garden. The cold lonely heart, Lord Craven (John Lynch) who was cursed and lived a dreary life was Collin's father. He only visited his son on occasions due to the pain he felt being reminded of his wife's death. Her friend was a farm boy Andrew Knott (Dickens) who showed love for animals and was seen with animals throughout each outdoor scene. He knew how to garden and helped bring life into the secret garden after ten years. The gardener Walter Sparrow (Ben Weatherstaff) allowed the children in the forbidden garden and was a kind gentle man. These characters and more created the storyline for the film and a sequence of events evolved. The sickly child learned to walk, the forbidden garden was restored and the orphan girl found a home. The scenery, characters and animals changed in the film from cold and dreary to loving and caring. The deep wounds were healed with the presence of a little girl and interesting enough emphasized by blooming flowers and strong emotions. "}]
