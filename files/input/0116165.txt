[{"Title":"The 3-Banana Scale","Date":"24 August 2004","Score":"106 out of 121 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Sport","Review":"  Despite persistent talk of Hollywood's Golden Age of Cinema, movie-making did not truly reach its zenith until 1996. The movie was Ed, not to be confused with the Whoopie Goldberg abortion of celluloid Eddie, that premiered during that same year. In Ed award-winning documentary filmmaker Bill Couturie employs the technique of cinema verite that lets the camera capture a true slice of sporting Americana... a monkey playing minor league baseball. Ed is not merely, as Brad Laidman of filmthreat.com raved, a movie some would say that kids may like, but rather the examination of the symbiotic relationship between man and monkey. Despite their outward appearances, can a clear distinction really be made between the monkey Ed and his human counterpart, Matt LeBlanc? In the film, excel at baseball (although the monkey is the star), both delight in flatulence, and both have giant cartoon teeth. And wonderfully, when the film reaches it's glorious climax, it is the monkey that most clearly embodies our notions of humanity, imbibing LeBlanc with the confidence to again throw his curve-ball, the pitch that eventually paves his way into the Big Leagues (this is despite LeBlanc's supposed ability to throw a 125 mph fastball). Although there may be some factual inaccuracies in the film (in a conversation with LeBlanc, a teammate tells him that Carlton Fisk was a flop in Boston, but went on to find greatness in Chicago), the true essence of Ed is in it's spirit... and in the fact that it has a monkey as it's star. Watching this film for the first time, I realized that I was examining the very embodiment of greatness. This being the case, Ed became the basis on which I would judge all future films. Forget Siskel and Ebert (especially Siskel) with their thumbs... forget Leonard Maltin with his stars... and forget A.O. Scott with his homosexual, liberal bias. The only scale worthy of film review is the Banana Scale. Based on 3 bananas (because really, who needs five?) this scale cuts through all the other ridiculous criteria such as plot, character development, acting and direction commonly used by other critics in their evaluations, and judges movies based on three essential elements. These elements are1. Does the movie contain a character from Friends? 2. Does the movie contain a monkey? 3. Is the movie about baseball? As you probably realize, there is only one film in history that contains all these elements, and, therefore, it is the greatest movie ever made. Citizen Kane by comparison, the film often mislabeled as the greatest, contains none of the essential elements of greatness. Therefore, it is hardly worth mentioning. But a movie such as M.V.P. Most Valuable Primate, centers it's story around a chimpanzee that plays for a youth hockey team. This is one of those interesting films that strives for greatness, but lacks certain characteristics that would've put it over the top. One may ask what director Robert Vince was thinking when he cast Rick Ducommun in the role of Coach Marlow when he could certainly have had David Schwimmer. And instead of hockey, why not youth baseball? But decisions such as these have presented film buffs with interesting fodder for years, wondering what could have been if, say, O.J. Simpson had in fact played the title role in The Terminator, or if instead of Leonardo DiCaprio, director James Cameron had cast Dustin Diamond, as he originally planned? But judging on it's finished product, MVP receives 1 1/2 bananas... one for containing a monkey, and 1/2 for being about a sport other than baseball. Not bad, judging against the current, deplorable standards of Hollywood. Based on it's greatness, it comes as a surprise to most that an Ed sequel has never been attempted. I have always assumed that the movie has become a victim of it's own greatness. Much like Roberto Clemente, who walked away during the apex of his career, knowing that he had reached a level of greatness that would doom his future endeavors to failure in the public eye by comparison, Ed director Bill Couturie knows that another installment would be severely overshadowed by it's predecessor. But taking matters into my own hands, I penned a letter to Mr. Couturie, outlining my ideas for a suitable sequel. The idea goes like this Both LeBlanc's character and Ed the monkey are playing in the major leagues... one for a team in the National league, the other for a team in the American. By coincidence, the two teams meet in the World Series. Although LeBlanc is now recognized as one of the greatest pitchers of all time, he is no match for the hitting prowess of Ed the monkey. And when they square of, mano-e-monkeyo, Ed the monkey is forced to make a decision whether to allow his friend LeBlanc to strike him out, or propel his team to victory by hitting a home-run, which he can do at will. I argue that this will be the first film that allows it's viewers to really get inside the mind of the monkey... to see his thought process, to witness what makes the monkey tick. By the time the last pitch is thrown, there won't be a dry eye in the house... and those tears will be both tears of laughter and tears of empathy... a rare combination. Although I haven't heard back from Couturie as of yet, I expect a response before too long. Ideas like this don't come around everyday. If not Couturie, I imagine a Hollywood heavyweight director will jump on board. From what I understand, Kubrick was considering optioning my treatment before his untimely passing. Although the idea was intriguing, I thought that perhaps Kubrick would understate the levity in a project such as this... opting for lingering shots, subtle dialog, and a brooding score by Beethoven, instead of the sped up action scenes, screaming monkey dialog, and circus music score that I believe the film Ed II Monkey in the Majors calls for.

Sadly his pitching, so perfect in practice, is way off in the games.  Things get worse for him when the team drafts in a new mascot &#150; a monkey, Ed, and Cooper is selected to room with him.  However Ed turns out to much more valuable to both the team and Cooper.This film was shown in the UK at 1130 at night!  This was why I had taped it as I assumed it was more for adults than children, after all Clint Eastwood had done a couple of films with a monkey in it &#150; so why not?  Watching I was left baffled as to why it was on so late at night when clearly the only people who would want to see it are children who will laugh at the sight of a monkey eating ice cream and dressing up.  The plot is pointless here and no child would care anyway &#150; if you can't guess what will happen at the end then you are a fool!  Will Cooper ever pitch again?  What side will the coin fall on?  Will Cooper and Ed bond?  All these are givens and there is no enjoyment from watching the plot unfold exactly as you know it would.While we're talking about lazy writing, how about the fact that every scene is a cliché.  We have the monkey dressing up and causing mayhem etc &#150; every scene feels like it is a template to which a baseball film has been applied!  None of it is funny (for adults anyway) and must of it is just puerile &#150; I laughed once and half-laughed another time.  The laugh was Cooper saying `oh, I'm gonna spank that monkey' and the half was Ed watching TV and seeing the episode of Friends with a monkey in it.  Other than this there is nothing.Part of the film's problem is that Ed looks like two things &#150; and neither of them is a likeable monkey.  First he never for once looks or moves like anything other than a guy in a monkey suit.  Secondly his face and his expressions make him look like a slightly crazy old man &#150; I wondered if children would take to this character or be slightly freaked out by him.  Matt LeBlanc plays a character in the mould of Joey &#150; but without the good writers to support him.  He plays second fiddle to a monkey and you can see that the confidence and comfort he enjoys in Friends, is absent here.  How people like Cobb, Warden and Caviezel must feel watching this is anyone's guess &#150; I suppose they were looking at it being a really big kids movie with the star of Friends, how could they lose?Overall I found this a rather dire experience.  Ed has no personality and looks really creepy and the comedy and plot are both as unimaginative as you'd expect them to be.  To be a good kids' film this needed to have a bit of spark to it &#150; instead it brings to mind the fading embers on a dying fire.

The animatronics wizardry aside of the Ed chimp, this film was not exactly wisely conceived. A chimp playing baseball, outperforming players on the field, and throwing a ball so hard and fast it smoked through the mitts of his teammates is a bit too far-fetched for many of us to accept. This is silly nonsense meant to give kiddies the giggles. My son was finding it entertaining, at least. On the most juvenile level, Ed might be tolerable, but I personally found it particularly ridiculous. Jayne Brook is well cast as a single mother love interest for LeBlanc, who stars as a fastball pitching prospect who just can't get his act together *on the field*, even though it's clear his stuff could be good if he could not give up hits and homeruns. Poor Jack Warden is stuck in the role of minor league manager, trying to bring some veteran mojo to this critically brutalized comedy. I just felt bad for the late actor. His talent is so superior to such piffle as this. LeBlanc is rather trapped in a humiliating misfire here. This is the kind of film that leaves a lasting stain. The chimp driving the truck with a drunk Matt in the passenger's seat bumping around, and Ed turning cartwheels in flight catching hit balls further elaborates how stupid this all is.

The baseball games are the best part of the movie with a very tan Matt LeBlanc acting goofy. The little girl acts much older than her age only because she is using adult language and I don't think that ever comes off well. The chimpanzee seems a little real at first but one can quickly see that someone is in a chimpanzee costume as the eyes look real goofy. The sounds from the chimp didn't sound real and must not have been natural-like or my dog would have gone crazy.

I also got to see at least a bit of the film at that gathering, and it must have been pretty new to the home video format at the time. I was ten years old when this happened, and I guess I was pretty much indifferent to what I saw, most of which I wouldn't remember. I don't think I ever heard anything about this big time flop again until at least nearly a decade later, when I noticed that it was in the IMDb bottom 100. Before discovering that, I knew nothing about the family sports comedy's general reception, but for several years now, I have known that it's generally considered to be atrocious, so I was not too surprised by its lameness when I finally watched it all, fifteen years after its theatrical release.Jack Deuce Cooper proves to be a very talented baseball pitcher while playing on his farm, and his skills get him into the minor leagues, playing for the Santa Rosa Rockets, but it turns out that he doesn't do so well while playing in front of a crowd. Soon after he joins the team, they get another new player, one who happens to be a chimpanzee named Ed! One would likely believe that a monkey couldn't possibly play baseball, but surprisingly, this one is a natural on the field! This unusual baseball player becomes Jack's new roommate, and unfortunately, he soon ends up causing a lot of trouble for the human baseball player in the home, making big messes and doing things Jack wishes he wouldn't do. However, despite Ed's sometimes reckless behaviour, he turns out to be a really good friend to Jack, and a big help to the Rockets during games, but somebody has other plans for this popular minor league player! I don't know what the humour here is like for kids, but while watching the film after growing up, there wasn't a single moment I was unable to keep a straight face through! Ed is one unconvincing monkey, and is also very unfunny with his antics! The sight gags involving this character causing trouble and being messy, plus the ones involving his bodily functions, are perfect examples of the movie's poor attempts to be humorous. Ed may be the weakest aspect of the film, but any other character that is supposed to be funny, including more than one human Santa Rosa Rockets player and the Liz character, also fails miserably. In addition to being consistently unfunny, Ed also has a dull plot (one could easily call that an understatement), and whether Jack Deuce Cooper is out on the baseball field with Ed, at home or on the road having problems with the chimp's behaviour, dating the Lydia character, etc., it's generally not entertaining at all. I should probably mention that the story sure is predictable as well, with no big surprises, and if the writers ever tried to be touching here, they also failed at that.All I could remember from what I saw of this movie back when I was ten years old was a baseball player saying Ed is Curious George, shaking his hand, and telling him he has read all his books, and the trouble the monkey causes as Jack's roommate making the struggling baseball player say, I'm gonna spank that monkey! Well, after watching what I saw all those years ago, along with the rest of the film, I'm going to remember a lot more, not that these memories will do me much good. If I hadn't been introduced to the film in my childhood, I doubt it would have really caught my attention when I found it in the bottom 100, and I wouldn't have ever seen it, but wouldn't have missed out on much had that been the case. Unlike so many other voters, I can't give Ed the lowest rating possible, and am not even 100% sure about my 2/10 rating, but see no really good reason why I should rate it any higher, since I agree with the vast majority that it's thoroughly unfunny and badly written. I may not have said much about this 1996 flop that others have already pointed out, but I agree with these criticisms, and would say there's absolutely nothing to make Ed worth watching!

I spent the first 56 minutes of the movie feeling an intense loathing of everything on the screen, by which point my face got tired from constantly having a disapproving look; so I had to go for an ironic smile for about fourteen minutes. At one hour and nine minutes the movie apparently got tired of itself and decided to start the plot which lasted for about ten minutes, after which it went back being loathsome. Shortly after the end happened but I still feel bitter about having seen it. It's not cute, it's not funny, it' just bad.

So lame that it boggles the mind to imagine that this film was made in the first place. I can only assume that the writers and execs at the studio were under the influence of some mind-altering drug while they were watching a re-run of a Francis the Mule film or else had loved ones kidnapped in order to force this film to be made. This is the only way you could understand this film. Even the worst of the most contrived Disney films of the 1960s and 70s look like Gone With the Wind compared to this! Matt LeBlanc stars as a guy who has a great pitching arm. However, when his game stinks, the manager punishes him by sending him to pick someone up at the bus stop. That 'someone' turns out to be a baseball playing chimp who is the team's new mascot. When I first saw this chimp, he really looked creepy--and I assume it was just a midget in an ape suit. It looked more realistic than chimps looked in films in 1940, but still looked bizarre and a bit scary! Well, only in a movie would it turn out that the chimp was a fantastic baseball player--with an arm like a rocket AND a thorough knowledge of how to play ball! How all the actors were able to participate in this farce of a film with straight faces is beyond me. Talk about an insane plot! Even small children would find this tough to swallow. However, given that he ultimately is SMARTER than LeBlanc isn't quite as hard to believe (at least in light of his role on Friends).Some of the low-points in this dreadful film include frequent fart jokes, snot jokes, Ed and LeBlanc both peeing together at the same toilet, belching, Ed driving a truck at what appears to be 400 mph, more fart jokes and Ed plying dress-up with grandma's clothes. At no point in the film is it clever or does it poke fun of itself (the only way this MIGHT have worked).Overall, a sorry mess of a film that is so inexplicably dumb that I can't believe it was made in the first place. Practically every cliché known to baseball is in this film and its only entertainment value is for people who want to laugh at the sheer inanity of the movie. Clearly, this film has earned its place on IMDb's Bottom 100 list!

I made it to the big date, and past cut week and the chimp and neighbor girl were doing something with food, but I have no idea just how long the thing would go on.  Bad script, bad sports, bad effects (not so much bad digital effects but incomprehensible ones- what was the deal with the dollar signs in the owner's eyes?  I know that the guy couldn't act, but still- let him put on his greed face that he'd been practicing in the mirror)I kept hoping that Matt LeBlanc, who I love on friends, and liked in Lost in Space had agreed to do this before he had a going career, like Jennifer Aniston and Leprechaun.  But there was a scene where the chimp was watching Friends!  I shudder to think how much LeBlanc must have been paid to be in this bomb.  I hope for his sake, it was a lot.And just one comment on the Chimp outfit-  couldn't they have somehow disguised the relative size of its head?  I know that there were people under the mask, but with the chimp head on, it looks like the cranium is half again the volume of Matt LeBlanc's! A chimpanzee with a brain that size would certainly be smarter than anybody involved in this film.  Oh well. A thoroughly hideous experience, gave me a severe migraine, and remembering it now sickens me.

It isn't even so bad it's good or a mess that is worth watching. It is an excruciatingly embarrassing film that has next to no redeeming features.When it comes to talking about what makes Ed so bad, I honestly do not know where to begin. The film is ridden with clichés, and what is worse these clichés are badly explored and written. Ed is also a very poorly written film, the humour is crude(which I didn't mind) but it is also very, very unfunny with minimal laughs and cringeworthy dialogue.The story is predictable too, sometimes that isn't always a bad thing, but it is when nothing of interest happens and you can smell events like the ending a mile off. The direction is flat as well, the production values didn't do anything for me and the soundtrack was annoying and too jaunty.The acting is absolutely awful, and it certainly doesn't help that none of the characters are likable in any way. Matt LeBlanc can be good and endearing, but he and his character aren't here. LeBlanc's character is so irritating you want to strangle him, and the less said about that monkey the better.Overall, an unfunny and embarrassing mess and possibly the worst movie of 1996, only Bio Dome comes close to being worse. 1/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"a story with a diabolical key...if only i knew the English word for it","Date":"27 June 2008","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Sport","Review":" Oh great, you think. another guy giving it a high rating for this beep just to be contrary. Ah-yawn. Well, maybe. It depends on your perspective, and I'm sincere in my belief that there's something about this movie that transcends it's own badness. From the look of the TV spots over a decade ago, it seemed like it was so horrible, by all accounts, that it SHOULDN'T exist! Anyway, me and my brother relived Ed-mania on premium cable the other night, and something odd struck me. Is it possible that this movie is a satire on what Hollywood thinks the lowest common denominator enjoys? Sports? Check. The show Friends? Cast member that the sports bar crowd fancies as their ideal self is in tow. A primate dressing like a person? We'll do you one recursion better. A person dressed as a primate dressing like a person.The Chuck Jones cartoon sound effects are there, transforming the shock of violence and injury into temporary and absurd conditions. The spirit of the Munsters, a satire on immigrants living in American suburbia, arises in unnecessary fast-tracking film techniques to make this world more cartoon-like and sped up during moments of intensity.The American ideals are constantly lampooned upon, sometimes in ways we're so used to living here that we don't immediately notice them. It's very telling throughout the picture, but I'll only focus on some of the final scenes, which is everything that follows a car chase (I mean, after all, car chases are part and parcel in crazy American life).A girl child prays to God at the eve of the big game to spare the life of the chimp in the hospital bed. As soon as she lays the chimp's pitcher mitt on his lap to go blithely get a drink of some apple juice (or something, I was distracted), the heart monitor begins to beep in steady rhythm and the once comatose chimp recovers and is eager to go to the big game. This entire drama, from the setup to the climax, is about twenty seconds in length. We didn't know beforehand that the chimp was so badly frozen in the truck that it would resign him to a hospital bed, and that cognitive dissonance is just as intentional as the scene where the chimp watches late night TV and plays with his food, I assure you.Before the final pitch of the big game, a distressed Matt LeBlanc wipes the sweat on his brow and calls for a time out. He runs to the stands and steals a kiss from the attractive woman, and turns to the chimp. The chimp licks his finger tip and knowingly chalks up another as Matt LeBlanc shows his dental work and nods in sinister agreement. As he heads back to the mound, he is now destined not to blow the game at all. The woman and a girl child stand in awe as their hair blows in the wind in one half of the shot, and the other half of the angle incorporates the American flag flying high and proudly. Now we have a nuclear family, including a family pet. Except the pet is not a pet. And the girl is not her daughter. Yes, those conflicts with the ideal are intentional. It's pointing out an absurdity that even the misfits can pull themselves together and be the ideal if we so choose, but only in movies.There are many ways to take the symbolism in this movie, and all of them are deeply cynical and rightfully critical of white culture and Hollywood, alike. Unfortunately, this film will only be preaching to the converted just as Beavis and Butthead also did in the same era, while sterile and boring masses take it at face value. The roman a clef to that show was that what they were saying itself was not the joke, but the fact that THEY THEMSELVES found it funny. The further recursion was that the kids who took the show at face value were looking in the mirror while looking in the TV--sitting on their couch, looking dead ahead at B&B sitting on the couch.I only go off on that tangent to say that Ed is doing a similar thing, but not getting the same kind of recognition for it because it's a few steps ahead of even this time and offers us no crutch of the mirror stage. That is, with the no-brow ironic movement starting to wane and with the introduction of the new sincerity movement where there is NO shred of irony, this is a very hard movie to place because the intent isn't spelled out for us. Were the movie makers being sincere in the way Ed Wood was sincere, and just didn't know they were making a terrible movie children would hate? Were they trying to be ironic, and try to make a farce of the Hollywood conventions in the hopes that the audience would go through an hour and a half deprogramming session? Or what is most likely in the children's market today--try to make a quick buck off in the risky market of imitating more successful movies, in hopes that parents would accidentally pick their movie up thinking it was a Disney Home Video movie? These are three dangerous prongs to dance on, because nobody has time to think about these things except for young adults that play XBOX Live too much. So the movie is a Chinese puzzle box, in this way...and I have the sneaking suspicion that the Ed team planned that all along.Trust me, if you smoke a few bowls this will all make sense, man.

Matt does a great job bringing to life 'Deuce' who is determined to make it through cut week. With his eyes set on one thing and one thing only, the game, 'Deuce' barely notices the variety of characters surrounding him. Including an outspoken young neighbor and her beautiful mother. With help from his newfound friend and roommate Ed, 'Deuce' lightens up. He becomes the player he new he could be and the hero he needed to be. The innocence that Matt portrays makes this character and this movie go straight to the heart. Watch it, you'll be glad you did. "}]
