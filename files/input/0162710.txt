[{"Title":"Boy meets boy.  Oh boy!","Date":"18 June 2001","Score":"34 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":" It's hard to imagine a gay themed film where the main characters aren't drag queens, don't have AIDS, aren't bitchy, catty, flamboyant, tragic or shallow. As it turns out, gay people, like non-gay people, can be all those things (and aren't we all tired of it) and so much more. In fact, the most distinguishing characteristic of gay people is that, for the most part, they are virtually indistinguishable from non-gay people. Isn't it about time a movie just allowed its central gay characters to be a couple of cute young guys whose casual meeting teeters over the course of a hilariously frustrating evening on the verge of becoming more than a one night stand?Gabriel, played by Christian Campbell, Neve Campbell's older brother, is a shy, aspiring composer with dimples to die for. Mark, J. P. Pitoc, is an outgoing journalism student who earns money as a go-go boy and has the body to prove it. Pitoc and Campbell, who appear together again in the Thank You, Good Night, gel beautifully as the put-upon would-be lovers. In a world where meeting and having sex can be a rather common and often all too impersonal event, they meet, and like most people their age, they want to have sex. But the story that gently unfolds is not at all common. It's tender, funny, and much more romantic than it sounds.Tori Spelling, it hurts me to even write this, is terrific as Gabriel's oh-so theatrical friend. She maintains a drama in her life that can be endearing, but is often times more annoying, the latter which Ms. Spelling portrays with great comic success. The rest of the cast is fairly unremarkable, with two notable exceptions. Steve Hayes is brilliant as a friend from Gabriel's theatre class whose hilarious Como te gusta mi pinga is the funniest cabaret number since Priscilla. Clinton Leupp as drag queen Coco Peru, delivers a delightful bathroom soliloquy that will have you in stitches. Even more amusing is the fact that Miss Coco looks distractingly like Ms. Spelling's character, right down to the overabundance of drama.Trick is an uplifting and life-affirming look at being young and gay and almost in love. Surely you were at least one of these things once.

My lover and I just watched this last night in New York City, with a predominantly gay audience, and we found it a delightful, unpretentious little comedy.For starters, this is a romantic comedy, making full use of all the cliches and conventions of the genre (i.e., our lovers meet cute on the subway and endless complications keep them apart).  None of this is new, but when I see people complain about these plot devices I wonder just how many movies these people have ever seen?  All this groundwork was laid down long, long ago in the silent era and certainly in the golden age of screwball comedy in the '30s.  So, the idea today is to see how well a filmmaker uses these conventions, not to wonder why none of this isn't terribly original!  In the case of Trick, these rules of film comedy are applied very well.This film is also, obviously, a comedy of frustration in that our two lovers want each other but can't have each other.  Events and people conspire against them.  Again, none of this is terribly original, but it is well played and diverting.  I especially enjoyed the absence of any stupid heart-felt, sentimental and unmotivated moments that mar so many contemporary Hollywood movies.  For instance, the relationship between Gabriel (Christian Campbell) and his best gal pal (Tori Spelling) was quite realistic.  She was a difficult-to-get-along with old friend, the kind you find hard to move on from. And the relationship (dating, we are told, from high school days) was convincingly complicated.  Yes, she was self-centered, neurotic, even ridiculous.  But, then some women are (as are some men).  This is misogynistic?  What, was she supposed to be some drippy, supportive, self-effacing female saint of a best friend offering her shoulder for Christian to cry on?  I liked her better as played by Tori Spelling.  Incidentally, Spelling has a marvelous scene of hysteria when she goes off in the diner about the cheese fries!The acting in this film was uniformly good, and quite high level for an independent film.  Far from being a numb skull, I thought J.P. Pitoc gave the go-go boy character real depth and sympathy. He was beautifully subtle in the first scene in Gabriel's apartment when you can see his interest in Gabriel come alive beyond a casual sexual attraction.  This deepening flicker of interest easily explains Mark's staying around through a frustrating evening  he sensed there is more to Gabriel and he wants to find out what.  Made perfect sense to me. Also (duh!) if he didn't stick around we would have no plot!The drag queen (Clinton Leupp) has a very funny monologue, also.  His presence in this film was perfectly logical  they are in a gay dance club in Manhattan for gosh sakes!  Drag queens do hang out in such places!  Further, his entrance into the men's room is also well set-up; he sees Gabriel dancing with Mark and follows him into the john to give him some dirt.  Motivation  jealousy!  I cannot understand anyone faulting the screenplay on this note.All-in-all, this is a slight, but very entertaining little film that tugs at the heartstrings a bit.  And it certainly is a crowd pleaser!  To hear a jaded NYC audience hooting and hollaring at any comedy was refreshing.  Trick is a carefree delight!

TRICK falls into the latter category.  Films in the former category tend to be too heavy-handed to be good (save JEFFREY and LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION!).  Here, screenwriter Jason Schafer focuses not on AIDS whatsoever.  In fact, it is never mentioned once.  Instead, we watch as two men (wonderfully played by Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc) try to have a one-night stand.  The only problem they have no place to go.  As these two men desperately try to find a room, fate interferes, allowing them to get to know each other before consumating the relationship.  Tori Spelling is terrific in a supporting role, but it is the two leads who must manage this film, and they do with astonishing realism.  It's a modern-day, gay fairy tale.  It's the type of film that makes you laugh, cry, and feel good in the end.  Hollywood could learn something from this small independent feature.

Right now he'd settle for a one night stand of hot passion.Especially after seeing J.P. Pitoc up on the stage of that gay bar doing the bumps and grinds, it's the man of his dreams. Fate is seemingly kind to him when he leaves the bar and he winds up on the same train as the object of his affection. Pitoc gets off at the same stop, eye contact is met and it's off to Campbell's place.Which he shares with his straight roommate Brad Beyer and has a female friend played by Tori Spelling who just bounces in whenever she needs to use or borrow something. When they go to Pitoc's world, Campbell is a bit put off by the partying world of the go-go boys. Will they ever get down to the slap and tickle?Despite the emphasis on sex and one night stands, Trick is really a delightful romantic comedy with a gay twist. Tori Spelling by dint of her name recognition from 90210 is top billed though she's really in a supporting role. She's very funny in the role of the gay man's best straight woman friend who really wants to dominate the lives of the gay people around her. Also a bit sad.Both Christian Campbell and J.P. Pitoc have gone on to some substantial careers on the big screen, small screen, and on stage. Pitoc made his film debut here in Trick. Both of them are cast well and I do love the eternal theme of the film that people can be quite a bit deeper than original impressions may make.

A big part of it is about the two main characters getting to know (and like) each other, and Gabriel realising that he's misjudged Mark just because he's a go-go boy.  This is cleverly done, following a line of 'don't judge people by their appearances', and Gabriel's realisations are projected onto the audience in a very effective manner- just because Mark dances half naked on a bar for money, it doesn't mean he's not intelligent or romantically inclined/trustworthy. JP Pitoc is superb as Mark, and has some of the best lines in the film, my favorite being in the late night restaurant where he answers Tori Spelling's denial of being a Lesbian in a very eloquent way, which surprises everyone (and the audience too).Well worth going to see, or getting on DVD if you're keen on the genre.  All my straight friends have enjoyed it, so it should appeal to a wide audience.And besides, its worth watching just to lust over JP Pitoc.

In the process of a few episodic situations, they actually get to know one another.Some day maybe this will be trite stuff, but based on prejudicial attitudes that exist in society today, it's a fairly important film.

With `Trick,' this process takes a few giant steps forward.  This may not be the crossover film many right-minded people might wish it to be, but it goes a long way towards showing that there is actually a benefit to making gay-themed romantic films.  Viewing romance from a gay perspective, in and of itself, helps to refresh some of the staleness that has inevitably seeped into the genre over decades of straight variants on the subject.  Even though the particulars may be different, the universals remain the same &#150; yet, somehow, it is those very differences that make us take a second look at the conventions in fresh and exciting ways.  For instance, I defy anyone to come up with a more purely romantic and emotionally uplifting scene than the final extended tracking shot of this film.  No film in recent memory has more beautifully captured the pure, life-transforming moment of dawning love better than this one does in that special extended moment at the end.  It reminds us of just how intensely straight love stories used to move us, long before they became tired and we became cynical.As in most movie comedy romances, the plot of the film is a very simple one.  Gabe is a shy, almost socially backward young musical comedy composer, living in Greenwich Village with a straight roommate who makes Gabe sleep outside while he, himself, entertains, seemingly on a nightly basis, a parade of willing young ladies.  Though Gabe frequents gay bars, he seems unable to find a comfortable niche in the high-speed gay world he finds there.  Then, one night, Gabe meets on the subway his virtual opposite, a muscular hunk named Mark who works as a `go-go boy' at a local bar and who exudes the kind of raw sexuality and high-stepping confidence that makes him attractive to many of the area's men including, not so incidentally, Gabe as well.  The hook of the film is that Gabe and Mark, once they acknowledge their mutual attraction to each other, are constantly thwarted in their attempts at finding a place to consummate their one-night-stand &#150; and, that, as the night wears on and a new day dawns, they both discover that their feelings for each other have deepened considerably beyond mere casual physical attraction and immediate sexual need. One of the factors that lends depth to this film and makes it more than just mere romantic puffery is that it does not deny the reality of its context.  It deals head-on with the issue of casual sex vs. committed relationships while remaining lighthearted and non-judgmental in the process.  Moreover, writer Jason Schafer and director Jim Fall demonstrate an ear for naturalistic speech, often finding humor and poignancy in the very same line of dialogue.  They have surrounded the two main figures with a bevy of offbeat, slightly quirky characters who make up Gabe and Mark's worlds in the form of best friends, roommates, former lovers, business associates etc.  Tori Spelling does a delightful turn as Gabe's ditzy ex-girlfriend and current best friend who feels conflicted over her own romantic feelings for this man she knows will never love her as she would like him to.  The women are not brain surgeons in this film (Gabe's roommate's girlfriend is another case in point), but they sure are likeable.In fact, likeability is probably `Trick's biggest selling point and in no area of the film is this quality more beautifully captured than in the performances of Christian Campbell and J.P. Pitoc as Gabe and Mark, respectively.  Campbell conveys the goodnatured shyness and sexual awkwardness of Gabe with a warmhearted subtlety that is truly infectious.  Pitoc also manifests the sweetness and intelligence that initially lie hidden beneath the veneer of his sexually-assured, almost dumb-jock exterior.  It is the ever emerging depth in Mark's character that wins Gabe over to his side &#150; and us as well.And then we have that great closing scene!  It reminds us all &#150; gay, straight or whatever &#150; just how transcendent that moment of burgeoning true love can be.  As Gabe walks towards the camera, smiling and peering out at his world with that look that tells us that the objects in it have suddenly been transformed into magical sources of wonder, our hearts go with him.  We care about how this relationship will turn out &#150; and, if that is not the mark of a successful movie romance, I don't know what is.

At one point, you want Gabriel, a gay would-be musical-meister, to tear into his inconsiderate straight roommate and get him to play fair.  But he's tolerant to a fault, and he doesn't really like gay people as a rule, and he doesn't like the bar scene, and he spends a lot of time with his ex-girlfriend (maybe to avoid any contact), and his choice of roommate is just his way of saying Hands off. He puts up with the impositions, so when he finally finds someone he likes, he can't find any privacy.  The entire night with his trick, Mark, is spent searching for a place, but they never do.  What each finds is something better a sense that they really like each other's company and that the sex is not as important as the companionship they'll enjoy in the long run.Trick doesn't have much to offer beyond this.  Christian Campbell is charming, and John Paul Pitoc is sweet, but the movie doesn't have much more to say than that homosexual men have as many insecurities as straight men, and maybe that they are more star-struck than their heterosexual counterparts.  The supporting cast make respectable impressions, but the movie never goes beyond being mildly pleasant.  Tori Spelling tries too hard to be engaging which means she's mostly annoying.  The freshest moments belong to Lorri Bagley as Gabriel's roommate's bare-breasted girlfriend. She has returned from an extended stay in Paris and returns with the intention of becoming a sex therapist, and considering what she is able to do with Gabriel and Mark, I'd say it's not a bad career choice.

The range of emotions and feelings Gabriel goes through (at first thinking this will be a quick release and on-with-your-life then being forced to spend time with this stranger and become closer) is heartfelt and true to the fact; I am sure many at one time or another have felt such pangs, doubts and excitement.Like in most films, the supporting cast is superb.

The cast is uniformly excellent, and the two male stars are not only very pleasant to look at, but they are delightful and heartwarming to listen to. The writing is superb, and the direction worthy of an Academy Award.

If there is theoretically someone out there for each and every single person, then who  cares about stereotypes on social standings and crap etc. True love is not defined by those inflexible  rules that run society; it is by following where one's heart leads to.  Too bad reality sometimes doesn't let us live our dreams the way we want them.

One night on a crowded New York subway their eyes meet and Mark decides to pursue Gabe for a hookup. However, they find themselves all dressed up with no place to go as they are thwarted by inconsiderate roommates, needy BFFs, spurned drag queens and flirtatious club kids, not to mention their own insecurities and burgeoning feelings for one another.Trick is somewhat low-budget but manages to work well within its limitations. The most recognizable name will undoubtedly be Tori Spelling, though most everybody else does a good enough job that the story is at least engaging. Christian Campbell as Gabe gives a terrific performance, really getting across his insecurity, shyness, and fear that the gorgeous hunk he managed to land will slip through his fingers if they don't do the deed soon. Spelling does pretty good playing a shallow, self-centered, struggling actress (meta-casting, anyone?). Clinton Leupp is also another standout, playing every campy drag queen trait to the hilt.Steve Hayes (Perry) gives the best performance, managing to inject genuine pathos and feeling into a character that could've ended up an uncomfortable stereotype. It helps that he gets one good scene where he sings a hilarious song in a piano bar. It also helps that he gets another scene where he tearfully reunites with an ex. He was so good that I sometimes found myself wanting to see a movie about him instead. The worst performance belongs to Jean Paul Pitoc, who's nice to look at and that's it.The shots of New York are well done and the city is shown as in a positive light which is certainly a welcome change from other movies even if the musical cues that accompany them sound like they come a different movie. Shots of the WTC towers will instantly date this movie but that's not something that can really be helped.Not all the music is bad though. The two original tunes the movie showcases, Enter You, and Como Te Gusta Mi Penga, have just the right amount of silliness to be charming. My only complaint here is Enter You gets horribly overused throughout the film, even playing during the credits. I would guess that the reasons for this are that Enter You was probably meant to be a metaphor for Gabe and Mark's relationship and the film's budget didn't allow for much original or licensed music.The first big problem with the movie comes from several plot inconsistencies. Perry is introduced as though he is not a main character and not somebody Gabe knows. He comes across as just another anonymous casting director at Gabe's audition but later Gabe calls him for help when he needs a place to be alone and watches him sing in a cabaret. Conversely, another character that Gabe talks to in the bar where Mark dances seems to be given some importance despite the fact that he never appears again.The movie violates the Show, Don't Tell rule in the scene where Gabe gets angry with gal pal Katherine in a diner. While his outburst is justifiable since Katherine does nothing but talk about herself, her rebuttal about Gabe pressuring her to experiment in lesbianism doesn't seem reasonable because we are never shown this. Even though Spelling gives the monologue her best it ends up being hollow because we don't see it. Maybe they ran out of money to shoot it? The biggest problem of all comes from the fact that I just don't see Mark and Gabe having a happy ending despite the movie wanting me to think so. It's stated, and in Gabe's case, shown, many times that they have no place to be alone which can be a drag on even the best of relationships. They both live in shoebox apartments without a nickel between them. There's a scene where a man checks out Mark as he walks by the stoop of Gabe's building and Mark appears to be checking him out too, right in front of Gabe, I might add.There's also the fact that Mark makes a living dancing in a thong and loves to dance the night away shirtless in a club. There's an offhand mention of Mark majoring in journalism, which suggests there might be more to him, but it's casually mentioned and forgotten. Mark seems to instantly fall for Gabe only after he plays his song for him. Mark ends up being as shallow as a kiddie pool and I think this movie could've greatly benefited from character development for Mark.Gabe is painfully insecure and a bit of a doormat who won't stand up to his best friend mooching off his computer or his heterosexual roommate hogging the only bed every night for his routine conquests. At the dance club he runs off taking the word of a catty drag queen over Mark to say nothing of the fact that watching Mark bumping and grinding against other guys would only exacerbate his feelings of inadequacy.I would give a couple like this a month in real life. If anything Perry and his ex-boyfriend seemed like they had more of a chance than Gabe and Mark. The whole movie comes off as the screenwriter wishing they could've had a meaningful relationship with a hot, young stud like Mark and deciding to commit their fantasy to film.I don't know. Maybe I'm just too cynical to truly appreciate this film.

Now I understand why there is so much affection for this film. It's really a bundle of contradictions. It's a gay movie, but its flavor is ultimately very much old-fashioned rom-com. It is sexy and very out, but surprisingly chaste and tasteful. It is not focused on AIDS, coming out, or angst, but acknowledges these things without being defined by them. The comedy is effective but largely because all of the actors play their emotions totally straight-faced, drawing humor from recognizable human reactions under pressure, not because of one-liners or gags. The cast has unknowns and at least one star, but the casting doesn't feel lopsided as they are all terrific and have great group chemistry. Coco Peru would threaten to steal the movie as the evil drag queen if the rest of the cast were not so uniformly stellar. The iconic Tori Spelling and the fabulous but unknown Lori Bagley seem to be two flavors of screwball adorable. The two male leads are just knockouts. The director has coaxed two very memorable performances out of them. One thing that must be said is how fully the characters have been directed to use their bodies and inhabit them (or not inhabit them) to make us feel their unease or their confidence. Just look at hand acting in this film. When Gabriel doesn't know where to put his hands whenever they are not set at a piano keyboard or when Marc peels his shirt off with one unthinking hand as soon as he enters the club, it says volumes about their back history so economically. This is outstanding acting and outstanding direction. SPOILER AHOY Finally, the interesting thing about the film is that it is structured as a brutal series of instances of coitus interruptus. The boys keep getting sooo close to finding a place to hook up and keep getting interrupted so cruelly that an hour and a half of this should feel intensely frustrating. However, instead, it feels like the most exquisite foreplay and the most skillful teasing. By the lovely end of the film, which ends in just one chaste, but soulful kiss, you don't feel cheated, you don't feel teased, you feel COURTED, and when was the last time a movie made you feel like that? EXEUNT SPOILER So anyway, go rent it or buy it. You're welcome.

The only problem is neither of them have a place to go, and when they do manage to find time alone in Gabriel's apartment, they are interrupted by his comically neurotic friend (Tori Spelling) and later the girlfriend of the roommate. So while trying to find a place to successfully do what the boys do, they find they share more than just a desire for sex, being tricked by fate (as the theme song reveals) as they possibly head for more than just being each other's tricks (a slang term for pick-up).Taking another gay tale of the naked city, Trick ends up being a sweet and likable romantic comedy, taking the viewer into the nightclubs of Chelsea, an Off-Off Broadway theater, a piano bar, a late-night village diner, and finally to the corner of 7th Avenue and Christopher Street as the two new acquaintances part. What kind of a girl do you think I am?, the confidently macho Mark asks when Gabriel inquires about their initial plan for sex. Along the way, there's a visit with Gabriel's older effeminate friend (Steve Hayes), who sings a dirty song in Spanish, a truly hysterical intentionally bad performance from Spelling as she sings one of Gabriel's songs at a musical theater workshop, and views of various types of gay and lesbian characters, some naughty, some nasty, a few nice, yet all identifiable to anyone who has ever ventured into a metropolis gay ghetto. Campbell and Pitoc share a sweet chemistry that has you really rooting for them, and you will laugh until you cry at the obnoxiously over-demanding character that Spelling plays. There's also a fabulous cameo by Miss Coco Peru who is not afraid of allowing the camera to get a little too close to her face to parody the drag queen image which only serves to show that there's more beyond her than what you see on screen.As far as this one's place in the over-emergence of gay cinema in the 1990's, it certainly is one of the more interesting, because it really explores the desire to find love while de-emphasizing the physical nature of the stereotypical sexually needy gay male. Even its title is a metaphor, the first impression being that it is all about the pick-up, then raising that flag in the viewer's head that indeed, it was about something else all the time.

How about showing a gay interracial couple? Or -- god forbid -- a movie with two gay non-white characters involved in a meaningful relationship or just a decent story line. I know, in Hollywood, gay movies aren't really considered a hot commodity but at least offer some sort of alternative to all these white-centered gay movies.

I originally watched it after a friend recommended it, and enjoyed it enough that I picked up a copy of my own. I dropped into IMDb to check out more info on the cast and ended up perusing the reviews as well. Those are what got me writing this. It seems as if a lot of the reviews either fell into the loved it or hated it columns. I think Trick has its flaws, but that it's, overall, a nice solid film that sits somewhere in the middle.Christian Campbell's Gabriel is awkward and nervous when dropped into situations he doesn't know how to handle--and it seems to happen to him a lot. This is especially apparent when J.P. Pitoc's hunky go-go boy, Mark, takes an interest in him. While Mark's (and Gabriel's) initial interest was for a quick sexual encounter, the evening's misadventures--usually courtesy of Gabriel's best friend Katherine--give the couple a chance to find out about each other, and particularly, that they actually like each other for more than just sex.My main gripe was that a couple of parts that seemed overplayed. Gabriel's roommate came across as too obnoxious for words. His perpetual dominance of the apartment space for his nightly tricks wasn't believable. Maybe you've had a roommate like that, but I haven't heard about it. The drag queen, Coco, was a bit too melodramatic in her toilet conversation with Gabriel. They were the only ones in the room so she could have dropped the persona to make a point. Tori Spelling went a bit over-the-top with Katherine in a few places. Or, perhaps, I was just getting annoyed with her.Trick is a sweet romantic comedy that just happens to revolve around a couple of gay men. It spends a frustrating evening bouncing from mishap to mishap, but when morning comes, you know that this was just the beginning for them and that everything will work out all right.

A little inconsistent at times but acting performances (or maybe just their aesthetically pleasing looks, it doesn't matter much) by both Christian Campbell and JC Pitoc compensated for it.  Dialogue and plot development could have used some improvements, but for a first feature film, it's understandable. As for Tori Spelling as Katherine, she was fairly good.  Though, I must apologize Tori, you'll forever be typecasted as Donna from 90210 and be the butt of many nepotism insults.  In my humble opinion, I thought the role could have been best played by Parker Posey.  Posey with her sarcastic sort of wit and humor could have brought a bit more to Katherine.All in all, this was a fairly good movie, especially because it was a feature debut film.  Great quoting potential by Judy (played by Lorri Bagley), for what she said as a 'heterosexual female.'

So rarely do they deal with the first night meeting! When Gabriel, a choirboy-looking non-gay-acting musical-loving youth, runs into Mark, the stereotypical hunky centerfold gay man of his dreams, and Gabriel is too nervous to take advantage of the first possible chance for a quickie, the movie takes off. The two search for a place to be alone but in the process, they both realize there is more than just a one night stand at stake. The straightest characters in the whole film are Gabriel and Mark. It is the supporting cast that supplies the comedy An egocentric lady-killer room mate, his breathy Marilyn Monroe wann-be sex therapist girlfriend, a fag-hag girlfrind who has designs on Gabriel for herself, a surly waitress, an obnoxious dog, a drunk pretty-boy, a middle-aged piano-bar queen, and best of all, an ascerbically-witted drag queen that can say IT BURNS like nobody, make this endless romp through Chelsea and the Village a hilarious quest for sex, and eventually love.Its a must-see for the gay man who was never very good at the one night stand thing. All those memories of hope and hormones will come flooding back! The part of Mark is underwritten, and perhaps he's not the best actor in the world, but Tori Spelling comes through with flying colours as an annoyingly bad actress (on purpose). Well worth it!

All the actors are excellent in their portrayals.  This movie might be taken as a bit soapy but  there is nothing wrong with that! After all, even Gabriel, a songwriter/lyricist for Broadway musicals said he was writing music for an artform which has been waning since Gypsy.  Mark, the muscle-bound go-go boy shows he has a heart even though no one believes that possible when first meeting him.  It's a fun, enjoyable movie with many familiar, humorous, slightly embarrassing moments we all remember.  Very nice musical score, too.

Although the film starts out about two guys looking for a place to have sex, it evolves into a story about two characters who learn to appreciate each other as people, rather than objects of pleasure.Gabriel is a wonderful character.  He is a gay man who does not buy into the cheap gay scene, but who is also not perfect in his resistance to fully recognize himself as a gay man.  One does not need to identify with every aspect of the gay community in order to accept and identify him/herself as gay.  Gabriel is written wonderfully and, in the end, he still holds onto his values, doesn't cheapen himself, and still finds love.  This may sound like an ideal situation, but it gives gay men like me who do not get into the seedy aspect of the gay community hope that they, too, will find someone someday.Quite sentimental, isn't it?

I had originally went in there to get a totally different movie but looked at the pictures and read the back of the movie carton and rented it instead.  I was wondering how a movie about a one-night stand could go on.  I was pleasantly surprised that the movie wasn't really about a one-night stand at all.  It was really about 2 guys who were perhaps looking for  something but not really sure of how to get it.  Gabriel is on the subway and just has to stay at this beautiful guy sitting across from him.  I would have done the same thing.  It is hard to resist such beauty.  What is even more weird is that this beautiful hunk, Mark seems interested in Gabriel also.  They get off the subway and just sort of start talking.  It seems at this point that they are just going to go up to the apartment and screw around but something keeps getting in the way.  Perhaps it  is analogous to real life.  Perhaps we all want to get closer to other people that we see and like to be with. Maybe it is just easier sometimes to just have sex and leave.  Even though the guys don't really know each other, there is an emotional attachment between them as soon as they get off the train.  I don't know why this is but I feel it myself sometimes when I meet someone who seems to think and feel like I do at the time.  In this movie it seems as if sex is just an excuse to get to know one another and it works.  Perhaps that is why sex exists in the first place not just for pleasure or making babies but as another excuse for getting out and knowing and caring for other people. Anyway, what seems at first glance as a shallow, self-centered movie, turns out to be a caring, provocative masterpiece.  Unfortunately, all movies have endings and this one is both sad and happy.  I almost didn't want it to end. I guess I was sorting wanting the same thing to happen to me.

But can they find peace and quiet, let alone a convenient spot to get off with each other? Of course not, this is New York.I was reminded of the light bulb joke about New York. How many New Yorkers does it take to put in a light bulb? Answer, 102. One person to put the bulb in and 101 to do the musical about it. Apparently every second resident of the hugely crowded Greenwich village area aspires to be in show biz, and in this film we seem to meet a good many of them. Talent, alas, does not always match aspiration, and we get a demonstration of this from Tori Spelling as Katherine, Gabriel's friend and aspiring actress. Actually she does a good job as a bad actress, but of course she's had some practice.This film opened the recent Sydney Gay Film festival and your correspondent caught it at a commercial screening flanked by two female companions in an audience otherwise consisting of people who could be described as designer gay. The torsos were tributes to the personal trainer's art and as for the clothes...I'm sure some of them had spent more on their outfits than I spend in a year. The audience laughed in a lot of unexpected places. This emphasised to me the movie's approach. Gay is seen as normal and it is the heterosexuals who are seen as peculiar. Gabriel's straight roommate for instance is a self-absorbed lothario who hogs their tiny studio apartment for his philandering, leaving Gabriel in the hallway. Gabriel on the other hand is looking for something more meaningful - picking up Mark is an aberration. Katherine is another self-absorbed bimbo, blissfully unaware of her lack of talent. Mark himself is initially a puzzle. A hunk with the nickname beercan (took a while to work that one out), he is content to tag along with Gabriel all night, putting up with the problems of finding somewhere to Do It, yet he reveals a ready wit in a street encounter. It transpires that he was looking for something a bit more meaningful than a one-night stand. Ah, romance!This was a lively and entertaining movie - Bedrooms and Hallways goes to New York, or rather off-Broadway. I didn't care for the length of the singing scenes and for a moment feared that the dog abuse of  There's Something About Mary was about to repeat itself. Yet there's an engaging freshness about the film that makes up for the occasional fumble. I particularly enjoyed the scene when Gabriel and Mark try to realise Gabriel's fantasy of being gone down on while he is playing the piano (I can't think of what to play). There's also a wonderful encounter with Ms Coco Peru, a drag queen (and former lover of Mark's), in the gay disco lavatory and some good one liners. As Mark leaves the disco after Gabriel he is distracted by another bare-chested hunk admiring his physique. A pick-up? No, he just wants to know where Mark works out.

The two protagonists, Gabriel and Mark, attempt to follow their desires for a sexual rendezvous. From there, they run into every conceivable roadblock, with hilarious and nerve-wracking results. In and out, we meet Gabriel's best friend Katherine (Tori Spelling is terrific in this role), and assorted characters that make this picture so entertaining.The screenplay's criticisms, sly and some loudly overt, concerning gay stereotypes are direct hits, courtesy of the writer, Jason Schafer.

The parting kiss and Campbell's Guilietta Massina-Nights of Cabiria final tracking shot, slowly growing in both happiness and hope is just lovely.  Pitoc is a doll with a body to die for (only one portion of the anatomy is open to speculation).   I would have liked the director to pepper the plot with clinches, escalating the lust/desire as each attempt at coupling privately goes awry - it would have kept the tension better as well as entertained gay audiences - but all in all, this is a delight.

It is always a little tricky with romantic comedies. Some of them are awfully boring. However, when the acting is good (which it is in Trick) and the story is sweet but still somewhat related to reality (which it is in Trick, just remember the ending!) then I like to see them.Campbell was great and the whole audience was on his side and suffered for him. Still I did not understand why he fall for Mark at all. Pitoc has little variety to offer when it comes to mimic and gesture. All of the supporting actors where excellent. Even Spelling was great. What I liked about them was that they did not only exist to support the story about Gabriel and Mark but had their own stories to tell. I especially liked that part about french breasts and prudish America.Isn't it nice to sit in the cinema and see on the screen sweet sweet love? If you do not like that don't go to see Trick. Isn't it nice to be in sympathy with the main characters and hope for them that they will find each other? Again, if you do not care for that, don't see it.I don't care whether this story is a realistic story about two gay men or whether it only shows a cliché of gay men.

The couple meet, the have that great mutual attraction, although it's sometimes unclear as to on what level, and they start, in one way or another to fall in love.  A good, old fashioned romantic comedy throws in a few complications to make it that much more difficult for them to get together, and then there's always the meddlesome friends or ex-lovers that get in the way as well.  Oh, and let us not forget a great comic monologue or two, some really sappy tear jerking scenes (perhaps of heart breaking abandonment, or something like that), and, if it has some music - well that's even better!  And, even better (at least in the late 90's, as sort of a Millennium bender), let's make almost all of the main characters gay.This, in a nutshell is what Trick has done.  It has given us the definitive, fun hetero-friendly gay romantic comedy.  Sure there are scenes of guys kissing, and some very beefy beefcake.  But not once do we actually see a penis, or a bare butt (well, an almost bare butt, and some very funny bare breasts).  And while there are drag queens, they deliver some damn funny moments and monologues.  Any cliches that my be placed within the context of this smart script by Jason Schafer, are far from gay stereo types and only act as a homage to the great Capra-like comedies of the 30's and 40's that only wished they could actually portray gay couples as real people.An ultra-low budget independent directed by Jim Fall, Trick has a slick bigger budget feel due to the sharp, street smart cinematography of lenser Terry Stacey and some great performances from a basically no-name cast.  The one name, if one can call her that, is Tori Spelling, who tosses away the entrapments of being daddy's girl in B.H. 90210, and turns on a surprisingly strong comedic performance as Katherine, perhaps the worlds worst musical comedy actress.  You go girl!  She could easily become one of those indie queens.  Not wanting for the cash of the big budget Hollywood films of many other T.V. stars, she's now flexed her acting muscles in a couple of low budget performances (The House of Yes), and proved herself a strong contender to Parker Posey and Rose McGowan.Let us not forget our lovely lovers, Gabriel and Mark, played respectively by Christian Campbell (Neve's brother), and John Paul Pitoc.  Both generate considerable charm as the frustrated couple trying to make it in the big city, as the films tagline would have it.  These boys should be watched, because they both have looks and talent that should shine through even stronger in future, less cliche driven performances.And one would be remiss not to mention Clinton Leupp's hysterical performance as a drag queen driven by jealous revenge.  This guy is a hoot...and he sort of looks like Tori at 45 (should I actually say that?).It's refreshing to see a film with gay themes so very much aimed at the main stream market.  Perhaps, with the dawning of the year 2000, Hollywood will take a nod from such strong willed film makers such as Jim Fall, et al, and begin offering us more cinema that touches our heart with understanding...that often we can fall in love with a person, not a gender.  And that we often do.

The lead actors don't play retreads of a generic romantic comedy, avoiding the worn-out cliches of extreme opposites finally attract, have sex, and fall in love and gay lovers must have hot sex, above all else.Christian Campbell fleshes out his character Gabriel nicely with a jumble of hopes, insecurities, and some sparks of lust that jump out now and then almost against his better judgment.  He is no longer a teenager, but he is no Casanova, either, and he knows it all too painfully.John Paul Pitoc starts out as the veneered go-go dancer Mark and slowly peels off his layers of defense (to Gabriel) as he becomes more attracted to Gabriel.  Pitoc develops his character deftly by dropping that defensive barrier and raising it back up again as each situation requires, while always studying his date and quietly opening himself to possibilities beyond a one-night stand.You can miss all these subtleties if you are waiting for something else to happen.They have taken the straight romantic comedy and changed its conventions to fit the change in circumstances.  Of course it won't look the same, and I am thankful for that.Trick is funny.  Trick is not a polemic nor is it soft porn.

I would normally find such a character uninteresting (similar to Billy's love interest in BILLY'S HOLLYWOOD etc -- yawn!), but Pitoc shows us how he takes a *real* interest in Gabe as the night progresses, and he is so comfortable in his sexuality that he sends sparks off the screen in a big way.Not an earthshaking movie, but I had a great time.

The plot is simple...two guys cruise each other on the subway, meet, then spend the evening trying to find a place where they can be alone together. Christian Campbell (a dead ringer for his sister Neve) sensitively handles the role of Gabriel, an introverted young gay man who decides to take a chance on a romp with a gorgeous - but slightly vacuous - go-go boy played by Jean Paul Pitoc in a star-making performance.  But the biggest and most pleasant surprise here is Tori Spelling, finally finding her comedic niche as Gabriel's neurotic best friend.  Tori really goes over the top here, but she makes it work.  Watch for a brief and hysterical monologue by drag queen Miss Coco Peru, all dressed up to look just like Miss Tori Spelling herself. This film is fantasy, plain and simple, but you'll leave the theater with a big grin on your face, just like Gabriel and his trick.

I just watched it again, I wonder why it didn't leave me a good impression the first time. It is sweet, warm hearted and romantic.Unlike some other typical gay movies that has some bad jokes with a lot of almost naked male bodies, this one is beyond that level. Even thought it was filmed in 1999, but in the year of 2008, it still can touch people's hearts.It all happened in just one night, yet it showed us so many people's lives in such a short time. And I wonder how long it actually took for them to shoot this film. Casting director did a good job, most of the people can really act. Even the dog is super cute, it is especially creepy and funny when the dog was looking through the window while the roommate was having sex with his girlfriend.There are a few scenes that I like, Gabriel secretly checking out the go-go boy in the subway train, he was truly acting with only his eyes; the conversation among those two guys with the girl who came back from France, the romantic moment of those two guys holding hands in the restaurant, and the monologue that Tori spelling did in the restaurant, I was surprised by her good performance.I also like the soft piano background music, that makes the movie less sexual, more emotional. I am surprised that those two male actors actually kissed right on a New York street in the early morning. They are probably both straight, and they had to do that scene right in front of everyone, in public.The cinematography of the ending scene is excellent, I can almost smell the warm summer air, and feel as if I was standing right inside the city. I felt as if I was right there ready for another new sunny day.One thing that I did not like was about Terri spelling telling the story about the Asian guy who is fascinated with feces. They can still tell the story without mentioning the person's ethnicity. Or was it an subtle racist comment about the Asian people? Then she made another comment about a girl with sexual problems, which she can't tell if that girl is native American or Filipino, was that necessary at all? I don't remember seeing any non-white person in this movie at all. If they spent the time to talk about other races, why can't they at least hire those people as extras? After all, it all happened in New York, non-white people are not that hard to find.

The film doesn't over dramatize any gay related issues or make it a point to critically analyze what is wrong with the world.

COMEDY  The marketing makes one believe that `Trick' is a funny sex farce about two guys who grow increasingly desperate to find a place to do it.  But there's no desperation here.   There's no escalation of tension as the film goes on.  One could re-edit the film, placing scenes from the second half in the first, and no one would notice any difference.

But the end is a let down.) CHARMING  While Gabe seems sympathetic, he's not very interesting.  Mark's motivations seem hard to understand as well.  Is he supposed to be mysterious, or just underwritten?  There's not many laughs here, because there's nothing funny about the way these characters connect with their world.  I regret that the gay audience is so poorly served by filmakers.  It would be difficult to imagine this film ever being made if the characters were straight.

They are cardboard cutouts with no depth and you never truly understand who they are.  Especially the go-go dancer!  His acting was awful, not to mention he had about as much charisma as Dolph Lundgren.  He was great to look at, but you never get to know him other than a few VERY small details (or one large one as the camera was desperately wanting you to learn).The movie is padded with dance and singing scenes.  If you took those out, you'd have about 60 minutes worth of movie left.The romance between the two leads is just pushed out there without any motivation.  Why do these two people like each other so much?  The only clue is the go-go dancers interest in the songwriter's talent.  But that's about it.  We never learn about the go-go dancer other than what his body looks like and that he lives with his mother.  Other than that, he is just there staring around letting Campbell's character lead him around like a dog on a leash.Also, within 30 minutes, Campbell's character learns what a sleazoid his new friend is by a Drag Queen. Then he gets all upset and runs off.  PLEASE! He has hardly had a conversation with the guy and he's getting upset that he's not the only one he's ever done?!  This guy picked him up for SEX for heavens sake!  That was the ultimate turn-off for me.Maybe that scene would have worked better if this story had gone on for a series of days and these two got to know each other better....but in this very, VERY rushed (it's over already?) film, this makes their relationship so unrealistic that I just couldn't feel anything for these two characters.There are much better films to see than this one.  Go rent Parting Glances, Jeffery or Prescilla Queen of the Desert if you want gay characters and romance.  All trick does is show us that gay people are way too accepting when it comes to gay cinema.

I mean, what's a gay flick without a drag queen clouding up the area. Critics (most of whom have their heads shoved up their asses when it comes to this kind of thing- hence the good reviews Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss and Kiss Me Guido got) say this is a breakthrough gay film, in that it doesn't rely on issues. Well, that's just fine, except it relies on good old fashioned stereotypes.I watched this film and didn't see one real person. We have the musical theatre writer, the go go boy, the queened out to the hilt cabaret singer who sounds less butch than wayland flowers, the fag hag secretly in love with her gay best friend and let's not forget that drag queen, who makes one of the most forced, inexplicable appearances in a film I have ever seen. (Plus, I have never seen a drag queen who does Anne Meara before, but I can give his performance no other explanation.)Where are the real people?Story wise, we are supposed to buy that these two guys who are looking for a place to have sex are going to fall in love with each other in one night when in real life, they wouldn't have a thing in common. Pitoc plays the go go boy as a tweaked out numbskull and Campbell is so full of nervous tics that you would abandon him after 15 minutes, no matter how cute he is. And after repeated shots of Pitoc looking bored and annoyed with the whole mess (just like some of the audience) he then turns around and tells us he thought this evening was supposed to be something more than casual sex???? There's no character development, no progression. We're meant to take enormous leaps of faith because the filmmaker tells us to, without giving us one reason why we should care about these people or want to spend time with them.It's a real shame that the wool has once again been pulled over critic's eyes.

Even giving the movie the benefit of the doubt and buying into its central conceit, it comes off more like a plot device than anything terribly convincing or compelling.Even more aggravating is the movie's total lack of dramatic development of its characters the go-go boy character comes off like a blank slate that offers himself sexually to the lead.  There is in all romantic comedies what might be called The Moment---when the characters finally decide to break through whatever contrived obstacles were keeping them from walking into the sunset together.  Trick indeed does have a Moment when the characters decide that they want more than sex with each other, but the characters are so underdeveloped that when this finally happens in the film, it doesn't register.  It comes out of nowhere, mostly because the go-go boy (J.B. Pitoc's character) doesn't seem to have gone through any sort of emotional or dramatic development the entire time the two characters were running around looking for a place to consummate their encounter.I sort of understood what the film was going for that when gay men look for sex, a lot of times what they're really looking for is a little intimacy and love.  A valid observation, but Trick does its audience a great disservice because it's too shallow and chickenhearted to truly offer any biting, observant or satirical critique of its characters and their mores.  Even When Harry Met Sally, a cinematic marshmallow if there ever was one, offered some pointed observations about the way men and women perceive love and friendship between the sexes.  Trick is so soft-headed and lacking in edge that it can't see beyond drooling over the big pecs of its go-go boy lead to truly examine the source of his loneliness (whether is was an acting, directing or writing deficiency I can't tell---most likely it's all three) that when The Moment comes it falls flat on its face and isn't in the least bit moving.  Trick is symptomatic of why so much of modern Gay cinema is a travesty; so afraid of critiquing the bourgeois values of its core audience and so busy pandering to the sensibilities of a gay middle/upper class perspective that it winds up offering no insight or dramatic drive which is the least of what a romantic comedy requires.  A brief scene in a gay bar, when the go-go boy gets to confront his shallow cohorts, had potential but the writing and direction pretty much blow it and there is no satisfying resolution to this encounter, which is a problem with the film as a whole.  A truly good romantic comedy probes the mysteries of the heart; Trick is doubly offensive because it pretends to do such a thing but is so preoccupied drooling over gorgeous bodies and campy humor that it never gets beyond skin-deep.  Trick is right.

The acting is mediocre, and the only person to have stood out on acting skills is Tori Spelling. She successfully portrays this annoyingly enthusiastic woman who cannot stop talking.The good thing about this film is that it is funny and entertaining. It does not play on the stereotypes, and does not show anything gross or degrading. It is a rather enjoyable film.

I saw this airing on Logo yesterday, so I watched it. For a gay themed movie, it was pretty good. Normally, if a movie has gay characters in it, it's a depressing story all about how they have AIDS, and how they deal with it, things like that. But this was a gay movie that was actually fun to watch. I was a little worried about it being a comedy, because they might stereotype the characters, but the only character in this movie that was a queen was Perry, but some gays are actually like that, so I guess I shouldn't complain. I'm not a huge fan of Tori Spelling, but she was tolerable in the movie. I thought it was sweet when she finally came to terms with the fact that she was a lesbian. But the one thing I didn't like was that I had a hard time getting into the characters because honestly, they weren't that deep. I mean c'mon. Timid music writer meets hot guy, and they fall in love? Not very easy to feel for them. Another thing was that it seemed like they kept avoiding a kiss. I mean, they tried to kiss what, like 3 times in the movie and they kept getting interrupted? I know this movie was made in 1999, before people were so accepting like they are now, but c'mon. But at least they kissed at the end. I would recommend this film for a rent if you feel like watching something uplifting. But unless you are making a detailed collection of gay films, then I wouldn't recommend buying this one. Overall, it's a fun film, but falls short. 7/10.

I fail to see what is so romantic about a couple of guys trying to find a place to have a one night stand. Nor do I feel it's funny. Unbelivable is a better word to describe it. If it wasn't for a drag queen (CoCo), the straight guys girlfriend, and an obnoxious Tori Spelling stealing the movie away from the main two guys, I would have walked out of the theatre... This stuff doesn't happen in real life.. I suggest the writer's get out and experience how life really happens once in a while.

Of course, the story about two such men is put into the slimy musical showbiz full of sissies. I hate this stuff. Why is there never a film with real guys who are  factory workers, hardrockers, etc who like other men? I also can't stand daddy's darling Tori Spelling. Also, it's really terrible realistic that two people can't find a place to have sex in NYC. Go see Jeffrey instead.

After all it does filter around the life of a Musicals writer. Don't get me wrong here, it is a gorgeous script... a little 'bouncy' though, but a good script nevertheless. I loved the awkwardness of the initial meeting between Gabriel and Mark. The tension was so thick I was under the covers screaming with laughter (I watched it in bed ;) )I personally cannot stand Tori Spelling, and think she should have been put down years ago, but alas... I have to bite my tongue here and say... *sigh*... she does deliver a very good performance. Who could ever forget the annoying little third wheel waiting for her resume' to print off. A little dense... but funny to watch all the same.I think this is a good movie to watch with 'someone' *wink* that you like... because this is most certainly one of those 'awww... sweet... how romantic!' plots that would probably end with the video playing through to the bitter end of the tape... and probably straight through to the static as well!It's a soppy laugh type movie... nothing more... nothing less. I'm glad I downloaded it though.PS and that eye candy... OMG! *swoon*7 flaps out of 10 "},{"Title":"Trick Treats A Bit!","Date":"9 May 2000","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":"  I am not gonna trick you now. If you suffer from a case of homophobia, then pass this one over. There are so-called gay films that are geared for a mainstream audience- Philadelphia  The Birdcage, and  In & Out. However, Trick isn't one of them. The movie stars Christian Campbell as a shy gay boy in his quest to bond with another gay boy who at first resembles a trick. There are many gay issues that are brought into the plot line that might not coincide with a conservative audience. Christian Campbell, Neve's brother, does give a fine performance but nothing to scream about. Also, Tori Spelling's neurotic performance was very lively. However, Tori don't lick your chops yet. You still have a ways to go before you could join the female acting elite of Beverly Hills. Now it is up to you to find out if Trick to you is a trick or a treat. *** Average  "},{"Title":"Lorri Bagley's Marilyn Monroe Imitation","Date":"23 September 2006","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":" I sort of liked this, but I don't believe in actors/actresses trying to get by imitating other actors. Lorri Bagley as Judy, has studied Marilyn Monroe and is trying to pass this little girl voice off as her own it's Marilyn Monroe's. Everything she did here was Monroe.I just wonder if she thinks that she can have a career doing this? I was in a drama class once (HB Studio in NY) and this girl was imitating the young Bette Davis popping eyes, snatching cigarettes out of her mouth, the staccato speech, even the Bette Davis strut. Our acting teacher, Steven Shrimpell, stopped her and said, you are NOT Bette Davis, stop it. That's what I'd like to say to Miss Bagley stop doing Marilyn!I wanted these two to get together and found Tori Spelling's character, very annoying. As a matter of fact, everybody was annoying in this except the two leads.

It reeks of cliche and has a flashing pink neon sign to boot. A wannabe Broadway musical writer, a go-go dancer, a little dog called Trixie, the melodramatic girlfriend... there are your warning signs right there.Throw in some of the worst acting I have ever seen, terrible, stilted dialog and drawn out scenes that play like a train wreck. Cute? Yeah, like one hundred pins in my eye! Seriously, there was nothing classy about this film, technically or otherwise. One star simply for the soft porn eye candy. One extra star because there is worse out there. But there is so much better as well.

Christian Campbell plays the closet case, and he is so unnaturally talkative and self-conscious that one hopes the director will ditch him and take the party elsewhere. Campbell, who smiles like a TV infomercial pitchman after reading his lines, has probably been coached into being a drip since this is the kind of delayed-intimacy picture today's filmmakers are most comfortable with keep the two gay men as far apart as possible--that way, there are no issues over showing homosexual coupling on-screen. Midway through, our white-bread hero gets cornered by an angry drag queen in a men's room, and it's one of the ugliest scenes in a gay-oriented movie that I can recall. So, will the would-be songwriter and the unassuming stud with the six-pack finally get it on? I'd rather see a picture about the older gay couple who reunite on the street and walk off into the night. * from **** "}]
