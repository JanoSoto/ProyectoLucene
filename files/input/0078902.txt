[{"Title":"an important and neglected film","Date":"5 July 2003","Score":"92 out of 96 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":"  I was nine years old when I first saw 'Breaking Away', and I think the book adaptation may have been the first more-or-less novel-length thing I ever read. My wild enthusiasm after leaving the theatre was similar at the time to my previous reaction to 'Star Wars', a fact that I attribute to the natural electrical charge of the endings of both films.Of course, a nine-year-old lacks the world experience to empirically understand the central messages of this film, and at the time my primary devotion to it was centered around Dave Stoller's orange Masi racing bike, a thing that I coveted with the passions of a kid on Christmas Eve.The movie made me mad with bicycle lust, and I frowned on every Huffy I saw at school. I used to draw pictures of Masi, Bianchi and Olmo bikes all the time after seeing this, and I shamelessly begged my parents for an Italian-made, Campagnolo-equipped racer - a futile thing to do, as my parents knew not to purchase something that expensive for a boy who would physically out-grow a pair of Levis within a school year. Ultimately, I was propelled into the worship of Eddy Merckx while all my classmates were digging into their Terry Bradshaw Topps cards, unaware - as I'm positive they still are - of who the hell Eddy Merckx even is.BUT...'Breaking Away' is not just a bicycle film - not by a long-shot, and I knew it then too, but that just wasn't very important to me at a time when bicycles were all-important.Despite my youthful energies, I never did pursue bicycle racing,(although I am definitely a touring enthusiast whose passion for Italian-made bicycles has finally seen fruition) but 'Breaking Away' never left me. It was the REST of the film that eventually got to me - and somewhat later in life - when my emotions and experiences with the world ran deeper.In short, this film explores many strands the aimlessness of youth colliding with the responsibilities of adulthood; the often heartbreaking romantic fantasies of people who wish they could be something else; lying and cheating and the false nature of gains made through them; the importance of strong family relations and friendships; and life in small-town America - and it does all this with extraordinary craft, honesty and sensitivity. It's beautiful, and more importantly, it is soulful and original. Although certainly dated in appearance, I'll even toss in the cliche that it is *timeless*, because the themes and characters are so.The characters themselves are all wonderfully brought out by the  perfect casting - it's been said here, but the fact that Dennis Christopher never achieved star-status is truly a shame and a waste of a potentially amazing talent. He played the lead role with a believable intensity and a really quite perfect understanding of his character. Dave Stoller's painful self-realization after the Cinzano race was as memorable a job of acting as I can think of. Paul Dooley and Barbara Barry were also wonderful, as were Quaid, Stern and Haley - every one of them created a personality for their characters, both in dialogue and physical reaction. The rest of the cast was likewise fine, each actor doing the best they could with what were sometimes stock roles (the college kids, for example, including Robyn Douglas, the female romantic role)The direction, story and, most especially, the dialogue were great as well.I also picked up a love of Mendelssohn and Rossini when I was just a kid after seeing this - the film score was superb, all the while taking the Stanley Kubrick/Woody Allen approach by choosing some choice compositions of a time long past, rather than belabor the audience with the refried horrors so typical of modern film-score composition.I hope this movie doesn't become a relic - it seems its own sleeper status has kept it shelved over the years. Mention it to just about any American born before 1975, and they'll know what it is, but only in the way I did when I was nine they'll usually say something like, oh yeah, the bicycle film! I remember that one, and then they'll likely have little else to say about it, which is a shame. I still whole-heartedly place this movie among my very favorites every time, and I trumpet it whenever I get into discussions with other people about the movies I love.

Most riders are bunched together for shared protection against the wind, and to keep an eye on their rivals--a group is always more efficient than an individual.  But in moments of confusion, a single rider might just get a jump on the group and, with superhuman effort, beat the odds against going it alone and emerge victorious. In Breaking Away we follow the exploits of four misfits just out of high school who contentedly contemplate a future as dead-enders.  They aren't particularly smart, athletic, or good-looking, and they lack any sense of direction in their lives.  Moreover, as townies, or cutters in a college town, they wear a spell of invisibility in their dealings with the students--the differences are painfully obvious.  When they hang out on campus or lamely try to chat up the co-eds, they might as well be ghosts haunting a town they used to inhabit.  Something happened when they graduated from high school and didn't go on to college  they became cutters, no better than servants, in their own confused eyes.   When we meet Dave Stoller (Dennis Christopher) we think, here's a guy who might be able to break out of his own rut.  He seems to be a kid with a little more on the ball than the others.  But then we see that he's also the most confused--by far.  Dave is wrapped up in a fantasy world where he's an Italian bike racer, a champion of a sport virtually unknown in America at the time.  That Dave's charming misfits of friends take him and his delusions in stride shows us the bond of their friendship and shared misery, and just how far off the map they've all slid.After a chance encounter with a beautiful sorority girl (Robyn Douglass) Dave pretends to be an Italian exchange student in an effort to woo a girl he believes would otherwise be way out of his reach.  He draws on his obsessive knowledge of Italian culture and his own quirky charm to fool the girl into seeing him as someone fresh and new, an outsider, but not a misfit.  The romance seems to be going somewhere, and Dave feels he's finally breaking away.While Dave is conducting his fraudulent personal life he also has an opportunity to race with the Italian bike racers he had worshiped from afar.  It's his chance to get recognition from the masters of the sport.  He may not have much going as a cutter, but he's certain the Italians will see his racing ability and welcome him as one of their own.  But when he shows that he can keep up with them in the race, naively hoping for their approval, they throw him into a ditch.  Dave's fantasy world comes crashing down.When Dave realizes that the Italians will fight to protect their turf just as much as the Americans he resents, his first reaction is to give up--everybody cheats he says resignedly.  And he rejects the friends who had looked to him for something more--his three chums and their own struggles, and the sorority girl, who had seen in him something special.Only Dave can save Dave, but it is his father's hard words that prompt him into action.  To Dave and his friends, a cutter is someone who doesn't measure up to the college kids who are going somewhere in their lives.  They affect being misfits because a misfit is one rung on the ladder above how they see themselves, which is as losers.  But Dave's father points out that cutters were the original stonecutters who built the grand buildings on the campus.  They may not be college-educated, Dave's father says, but to them cutter is a badge of honor for the hard-working men who built something real out of the flat earth.  Dave will never be a cutter, he says, meaning a man of accomplishment, unless he finds something equally real to do with his own life.The Indiana Little 500 is a bike race the university holds that is taken very seriously by the groups that participate.  At the time, it was the largest race in America, and fraternities counted some of the best American bike racers on their squads.  But to Dave and his friends who are invited to race, it is a chance to prove to the students (and themselves) that their lives so far weren't just wasted time.Yes, Dave is a gifted bike racer, but we already knew that.  But the Little 500 (and life) requires that one rely upon not just inner strength, but the creative use of the strengths of others.  It is a team race.  What Dave learns when testing himself against these college students that he never felt would give him the time of day, is that the biggest obstacle to his own success was himself.  Breaking Away  is a rich visual tapestry of life lived outside the spotlight.  The characters are not fancy or sophisticated, and their life goals are simple and well within reach.  It is themselves they struggle with, and their perceptions of themselves.  Breaking Away is the story of kids who had let their own self-image degrade to the point that a fantasy world, and a life of bitter resentment, seemed like their best option.

Oh, its parts are wonderful.  The writing is sharp, observant, and funny (It won an Oscar!), the acting is superb (how Paul Dooley was nixed a nomination never mind the award I'll never know), and it is a well shot film.  But its charms go even deeper.  It is the story of four young men in their late teens, who are staring adulthood in the face after a year of leisure in the small town of Bloomington, Indiana, and how they deal with watching successful college kids pass them by.  It is also about a young man in search of an identity (including that of a Italian bicycle racer), and of a family that is loving and supportive, almost in spite of itself.  All these add up to a richly enjoyable, deeply moving family picture that gives us many moments to treasure (a large number include Paul Dooley as the frustrated and confused, but eventually loving father).  Like other sports movies (the lead character races bicycles), it has a contest at the end, and like many much poorer ones, it ends with triumph.  But we cheer not only for these immensely likeable cutters, but for ourselves, for being treated to this bittersweet, touching, and wonderful movie.

We had decided to go to a double feature of two movies that we had never heard of, knowing that in that day and age, a double feature meant that at least one, if not both movies, had to be pretty awful.  The first film was Starting Over with Burt Reynolds, and it was fairly good.  So my friends were sure that the other would have to be terrible, but we had nothing better to do, so I convinced them to stay.  Before three lines of dialogue I was absolutely hooked.  I have seen it at least twenty times and the witty dialogue and rapport of the characters gets me every time.  The music accents the film beautifully. The cinematography is gorgeous.  But the story is what really matters. Four guys finding there way in a place where they feel little hope for the future, one a dreamer whose dreams are crushed, but he finds the spirit to pick up and start dreaming again.  Delightful all the way around.

No sex, no violence, no special effects.  Just an incredibly literate and humorous script (which won an Oscar for Steve Tesich) and fantastic performances by the four leads.  This is a film for those who still believe that good cinema requires meaningful dialogue and acting that is achingly real in its sincerity.  Don't get me wrong sex and violence have a very real and justifiable place in film; but this movie would have suffered from such a gratuitous inclusion.  Peter Yates, the director, has done a fantastic job of pacing the film, and the score, consisting mostly of Rossini overtures, and excerpts from Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony (#4 in A Major, Op. 90), is an inspired touch, adding precisely the right atmosphere.  This is the kind of low-budget triumph that the film community constantly extols for P.R. purposes, yet never supports with actual awards.

That time in your life when, for the very first time, you had to begin to make decisions that could affect the outcome of your life. There is no movie that captures this time, the transition from teenager to adulthood, quite as well as Peter Yates' superb film Breaking Away.The story takes place in Bloomington, Indiana,  (home to Indiana University) one of the bigger college towns in America. It concerns the rivalry between the rich, snobbish college kids and the local townies (called cutters because there fathers cut limestone in the local quarries to build the college, among other things.) The cutters are played superbly by Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern and Jackie Earle Haley. There is not a false note in any of their performances with Quaid and Christopher special stand-outs. It is interesting to note that of the four, only Quaid and Stern went on to bigger and better things.What really carries this movie though, are the universal themes that everyone can relate to. We can all relate to at least one of the stars, everyone has gone through what they are going through. Most people realize it as one of the more difficult times in their life (as it is for the characters portrayed in the movie.) What carries them through is their friendship with one another, and the support that that gives them. The movie also touches upon family and how hard it is sometimes to communicate with parents, who always (hopefully) love but sometimes just don't understand. Special mention must be made of Paul Dooley (who plays the father of Dennis Christopher), how he did not receive an oscar nomination much less win the coveted statue, for his performance, remains a mystery to this day. Barbara Barrie is also excellent as the mother.The story follows the cutters as they try to prove to the college kids that they are real human beings, not outcasts to be looked down upon. As one of the cutters is a champion bike rider, the climax of the film and the contest to prove their worthiness, comes down to the Little 500 Bike Race. This is an annual bike race that is still held at IU and is one of the seminal sporting events of the college year (the screenwriter Steve Tesich, who won an oscar for his screenplay, actually won the Little 500). It is the perfect ending for this remarkable and uplifting film.Praise must be given to everyone involved with the production, there is not a false note throughout the movie. Peter Yates did a superb job of taking relatively unknown actors coupled with tough subject matter and turning it into a minor classic.

Other reviewers have given good summaries of the film, so I won't go into it. It's interesting though that of the four principle actors, only Dennis Quaid had any kind of career after this, which is very surprising since they were all such strong performances. Breaking Away really captures that limbo period right after high school when you're not sure what the future holds. I identified strongly with Dennis Christopher's character - I though I was going to just pump gas or flip burgers for a year before my mom pushed me to go to college. In other words, this is a realistic, character-driven movie - you'll probably find a bit of yourself in one, or several, of the characters. There's also real chemistry here between all the actors. And the photography really captures the beauty of the Midwest (some of you, no doubt, are scratching your heads after reading that). This is a gem - don't pass it up at the video store or when it appears next on TV.

It has an endearing teenage hero, an engaging story, a touching theme, an amazing musical score, and an abundance of humour. The story revolves around Dave Stoller and his three buddies, four misfits who have just graduated from high school. Dave recently received a bicycle as a gift, has become a good racer locally, and his heroes are the Italian Cinzano racing team. To the consternation of some, his life begins to revolve around his dreams of becoming a racing champion, to the extent that he basically tries to turn himself into an Italian. He learns the language, absorbs the culture, listens to its operas, and gives his cat an Italian name Fellini! He even pretends to be an Italian exchange student in order to impress a pretty sorority girl named Katherine, whom he calls Caterina and feels would otherwise be beyond his reach.Dave makes an appealing hero, wonderfully portrayed by Dennis Christopher, vulnerable but with an amazing joie de vivre. His hilarious attempts at becoming Italian, for example shaving his legs like their men but not their women, proved one of the highlights of the movie. The scene where he serenades his Caterina at her sorority house has to be one of the most charming in all filmdom. I was also bowled over by his endearing enthusiasm when he discovers The Italians are coming!, that his racing heroes will soon be arriving in his hometown of Bloomington, Indiana where the entire tale is set, culminating in the Indiana Little 500 cycling race.Dave is a kid who doesn't think he is good enough for college, lives in a fantasy world of Italian cycling, and wants to break away from his own aimless, mundane life. This is a typical coming of age movie in that he learns a lot about himself and the realities of life, especially from the behaviour of his heroes, the Cinzano racing team. His three sidekicks are a sympathetic bunch -- the rebellious, angry Mike, the short, feisty Moocher, and the goofy, appealing Cyril who seems to have no family. Through competing against the college crowd in the Little 500, they learn lessons in self esteem and team spirit, believing in yourself and striving toward reachable goals.Breaking Away is a movie with obvious social class themes. Dave and his friends are townies called Cutters, named for the stonecutters from the town's quarries. The students at the nearby college campus look down their noses at these Cutters. However, Dave's father, who is a car salesman lacking a college education himself, teaches his son to take pride in the name, that it was stonecutters who built these impressive college buildings.The film is refreshingly unusual in having a major sympathetic role played by Dave's parents. I absolutely loved the father, portrayed by Paul Dooley, the source of much of the film's humour, announcing for example that he doesn't want anything in his house that ends with 'ini'! Mr. Stoller despairs of his son's Italian phase, fearing verbally that Dave is going to wind up an Italian bum! Both the marital relationship between Dave's parents and the bond between father and son are captured with poignancy as well as humour.When I first saw this movie after its original release, the thing that remained with me besides the charming joie de vivre of its hero was the wonderful Italian music, from Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony and a Rossini opera. This musical score provides magnificent accompaniment to the bicycle racing sequences, especially one in which Dave is racing the Cinzano truck on a highway heading toward Bloomington! This is a heartwarming movie that no one should miss. It may be almost thirty years old but its characters and story are as engaging as the day it was released. I won't give it away, but that last scene is priceless! "},{"Title":"Classic coming-of-age film","Date":"4 September 2004","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":"  <Warning Minor spoilers cometh.> I first saw this movie in a theatre right after it came out in the fall of 1979. I was like 11-years old and trying get into a Saturday night showing of Apocalypse Now with a few other friends during a b-day outing.That night (I still remember quite vividly 24-years later), the cashier at the Golf Mill Theatre in Niles, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago) was being a total wench and wouldn't let us -- a bunch of well-groomed, fresh-faced, albeit unaccompanied 11-year olds -- into an R-rated flick. So, the only other option playing that night was Breaking Away, which we reluctantly decided to see instead. Being the very last ones in the theater, we were seated front-and-center in the very first row -- just feet from the bottom of the screen. And although we spent the entire two hours of the movie with our eyes skyward and our necks bent at an obtuse angle in order to see this movie, Breaking Away proved to be one of the best coming-of-age movies that I have ever seen. Anyways, it was great watching this movie in a theatre. During the entire showing we laughed, we yelled, we screamed, we snickered, we guffawed, we threw popcorn at the screen -- we did it all. And when Dave (played by Dennis Christopher) brought the Cutter Team home in the last lap of the Little-500 Bicycle Race, we cheered -- boy, did we cheer -- along with the rest of the theatre. Those were the days, and this film is now one of my top-10 feel-good flicks of all time. Side note About two years after the film came out, I happened to bump into the inimitable Robyn Douglass (who played the hot coed Katherine/Caterina) at a sporting goods store in downtown Wilmette, Illinois. I wanted to say something to her, but I couldn't b/c I was tongue-tied due to my teenage hormones getting the better of me (I was 13 at the time). Come to think of it, that just about summed up the totality of my teenage existence back then, but I digress. Memorable characters in this film were Dennis Quaid as Mike, the aging ne'er-do-well townie living on his past successes as a high-school football quarterback; Daniel Stern as the bucolic wiseacre Cyril (in his first cinematic appearance); and Jackie Earle Haley as Moocher, the volatile clock-punching runt. There was also the unforgettable performance by second-city veteran and co-creator of the inimitable 1970's children's show, The Electric Co., Paul Dooley, portraying the disaffected used-car salesman Raymond -- Dave's father. Some of the most memorable scenes in this movie are set to classical scores -- especially the fantastic racing scenes. For example, my personal favorite is when Dave finds out that Team CinZano is coming to Indianapolis for a big cycling race. He immediately kisses everybody in sight, crosses himself, and says Santa Maria -- even though his family isn't Catholic. He then hops on his racing bike, and proceeds straightaways to the outskirts of town, where he intercepts the Team CinZano truck (how likely is that?) on the Interstate passing through town. Dave then goes head-to-head with the speeding semi-truck until he overtakes it at 60 mph, with the old-timer truck driver egging him on every step of the way as he calls out his speed with hand signals out the window. The entire scene has outstanding long-shots of Dave racing a semi on a highway set to Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony No.4 in A major, opus 90.The other great racing scene is during Dave's starcrossed participation in the Indianapolis 100 cycling event where Dave fatefully endeavors to strike it up with Team CinZano. The entire race is set to Rossellini's rousing William Tell Overture, and is simply riveting -- as well as shocking. The funniest scene, though, is when Dave serenades his pipedream sorority chick, Caterina, whom he's infatuated with to Flotow's aria M'appari, tutt'amor -- MAARTHA, MARTHA -- in front of her Chi Delt sorority house. To die for -- especially, when he gets the girl and they ride off into the night in the middle of campus, albeit with Caterina precariously perched atop the handlebars of his ten-speed. Incidentlally, of all the Breaking Away cast members, Dooley and Quaid had the most prolific and successful careers afterwards. Dooley would go on to play Molly Ringwald's goofball dad 7-years later in Sixteen Candles, and Dennis Quaid, of course, has been in everything from The Right Stuff to DOA to InnerSpace to The Rookie. (Sidebar I graduated from a land-grant state university myself that was virtually identical to I.U. Bloomington -- complete with townies and everything. I did a lot a cycling at the time, and every time I did, I couldn't help but feeling exactly like Dave Stoller.) Hat's off to a primo, nummero uno coming-of-age flick!

I hadn't seen it for years, going back decades probably. I saw it originally when it came out, as I was only a couple of years junior to those portrayed on the screen. Like others have mentioned, the acting was superb and true to life. Not one second on screen do you feel anyone is acting. Dennis Christopher as lead character David Stoller is really a joy to behold. His enthusiasm is never forced or fake. He pulls it off beautifully. And Dennis Quaid's Mike character is probably all too common in this world of high school stars peaking with graduation. His story is quietly repeated among so many who saw their best years in high school only to watch others get the longer lasting glory. The speeches he gives are poignant, deep and yet perfectly fitting of his character. He does a wonderful job of showing the frustration of change. Daniel Stern's Cyril is perfect as the more comical of the bunch - simply perfect casting. Some of his lines are just priceless. And Jack Earl Haley and 'Moocher' looks like so many of us looked like back then, me included (though I wasn't short). Long straggly hair, t shirt, jeans and string-bean skinny. Paul Dooley and Barbara Barrie were wonderful. As were the brief shots of others at the Little 500. I can only imagine they were locals hired as extras. Hart Bochner (Lloyd's son) did a fine job as the snob jock. Gotta admit, they didn't come better looking than that back then. I sometimes wonder if Paul McTiernan didn't intentionally subject Hart to that somewhat comical but deadly ending in Die Hard out of payback for being such a jerk in Breaking Away.Katherina played by Robyn Douglass was wonderful. She had that perfect look of girls you would just die for back then. She even resembled a girl me and my pals were all in love with back in Chatham Township high school. I loved her scenes and her moment when she finds out the truth. Really jolts you out of your seat. Choked me up. Watching this film really made me aware of how we've changed, not just in our clothing or hair styles, but in our entire lives. Everything is brand-name now, everyone is so conscious of who made the object they desire and how much it cost. The more expensive the better. Everything is new and shiny. Every single element in a movie is examined from eyeglasses to shoes to pens. Everything is measured for its affluence and brand quality. Back then, we had Schwinns, Huffys, Raleighs, even Sears and whatever else we could afford. We wore clothes just like those kids in the move wore, T shirts, old jeans cut-offs in summer, and ripped up sneakers. We had fishing holes or swimming holes and spent enormous amounts of time riding bikes, or just laying in the grass or on rocks in the sun, or up in some tree house, just thinking or talking or planning out the universe... and also about girls, which none of us had actually had any meaningful contact with yet. A magical time in a boy's life. Reminds me of the time we discovered an old playboy in the woods under a fallen tree. It was a huge deal with us at the time. We'd hide it back under the tree trunk wrapped in some plastic and go back to it when we were back there. Nowadays, the most descriptive and graphic porn that even Ripley wouldn't believe is simply a click away 24/7. It's a different world, indeed. (Ironically, as a side note, the Playboy issue, we found out years later was the one that highlighted the ill-fated Dorothy Stratton.)Nowadays, can you imagine anyone, especially a 19 year old kid sitting still out in nature or anywhere else for that matter for even ten seconds without whipping out a smart-phone or some other gadget?

It's just sad that such a time in life is gone forever, not just in the styles which were, yes, sloppy, an unkempt, but in the way kids lived. It's an entirely different world today and I wouldn't trade my childhood in the 70s and early 80s with any kid today for all the money in the world. I sat through the film twice, loving it so much and knowing I'd probably never get a chance to see it on the big screen again. Watching it with tears in my eyes, I really felt such an urge that if I could have, I would've climbed into that screen in a second to go back to that time once again that is never more.

Peter Yates does a wonderful job directing, the pace never lags, all the characters are credible and I'll be honest, this film does have an impact on me emotionally.

Kramer v Kramer is a good movie but hardly covers the range of emotions and angst felt by the characters in Breaking Away.Every performance by the kids is spot on as well as the parents. You feel for Dave and his friends as well as understand why his parents do what they do. Nothing in the movie feels forced, even the race at the end. Yeah, you know Dave will win but it still makes you want to stand up and cheer.A friend of mine that grew up as a townie in Illinois said the movie was exactly as it was when he was growing up as regards the interaction of the students and the locals.The thing I liked most about this movie is that Tesich and Yates don't make the townies saintly good guys and the students evil baddies. They are all humans with various motivations and foibles like the rest of us.As much as I admired this movie I had the bad feeling K v K was going to win best picture. Maybe most of the members of the academy could relate to divorce (that's for sure) as opposed to understand growing up in a college town. Watch it and appreciate a rare movie that is perfectly written, acted and directed.

Coming from a blue collar town I don't believe there was a kid alive in our neighborhood who didn't want a 10 speed bicycle after seeing this one.I also come from an Italian family so this film especially hit financial and nationality cords with us. Although the lead Wasn't Italian his desire to be was humorous and brought haunting familiarity to the film for us.That however is not why I have been a HUGE fan of this movie for the last 26 years. The characters are... They are portrayed by the actors with such intense realism that to deny this films significance to every single person who comes from a blue collar background in a somewhat large city would be ludicrous.I dare anyone from a working class family who was coming of age in the late 70s and early 80s to deny this films relevance. I knew every single one of these characters personally growing up from the used car salesman father to the Marlboro smoking muscle car abusing bad ass. From the quiet yet forceful mother to the tall skinny goofball ceral...Moocher to Dave I knew them all every single one of them residing in or near my neighborhood.This film touched our hearts. It spoke of the emotional struggles we went through as children and adults being in a blue collar world. The fantastic part? It did this with humor, a sense of friendship(regardless of how dysfunctional) and an innocence on the brink of realization. Just the way it was. We cheered loudly at the end of this movie as we ate our goobers and popcorn then sighed silently as we left the theater squinting to take the city bus home...

The first of the many satisfactions the film provided me was the magical moment where I finally found it&#x85; and God, I wasn't disappointed.Breaking Away opens in a small town of Indiana, with four friends and as many personalities to identify with. Mike (Dennis Quaid) is a former athlete venting the bitterness of unfulfilled athletic dreams on local college' upper-class students. Moocher (Jackie Earle Haley) is hung-up on his height, trying to repress his insecurity while enduring derogatory nicknames every day. Cyril (Daniel Stern) a tall and lanky former basket-ball player and guitar apprentice cares as much about his future as his own father cared about him. And surprisingly, Dave (Dennis Christopher), the central protagonist is the most upbeat of the bunch.Breaking Away is one of these miracles that only the New Hollywood era could provide, something that cuts straight to your heart without you even noticing it. It carries the authentic realism of its Best Picture co-nominee Norma Rae, with a more heart-warming effect you smile, laugh and embrace the friendship between these boys who don't know what to do with their post-high-school future, and keep reinventing the world when they go swimming in the abandoned water-filled quarry. And there is something in Peter Yates' directing, that invites the viewer to seize the present with enthusiasm.And the enthusiasm is embodied by one of the most engaging and lovable characters I've seen in a long time. Dave is so obsessed with the Italian cycling team he translated it in his own life. He talks and sings in Italian and in English with Italian accent, infuriating his Dad (Peter Dooley) who must endure food ending with '-ini-' all the time instead of something American like French Fries. The portrayal of Dave's parents is far from the stereotypical detachment, the mother (Oscar-nominated Barbara Barries) cares too much while the father believes a 19-year old shaving his legs, listening to opera must have some serious issues &#x85; While watching Dooley, I kept wondering what happened to his Oscar nomination, he's hilarious to a Walter Matthau-level.The story goes on, Moocher gets a job but finally leaves it after one 'shorty' too many, Mike keeps clashing and competing with the rich college boys who call him 'cutter', a reference to the working-class that built the college and Cyril is the eternal victim of his helpful nature. Drama always works as a misleading safeguard. Many times, you expect an accident to happen, in the quarry, during a fight, but Dave's excitement to compete against the Italian team, in a local sporting event, makes us lower our guard. Amazingly, Dave isn't your typical bleak and disenchanted underdog hero, his cheerful attitude towers over his friends' struggles as we would all love to do with ours.And in one of the film's most exhilarating sequences, he follows a semi-truck in a freeway with the perfect music in the background, Barber of Seville's Overture. Dave grabs our heart like Opera our feelings, it's so genuine that many stereotypical situations work like serenading Katherine, the girl he loves, or courting her with an Italian accent, we believe Catherina would fall for it, because we would too. And while I loved watching Dave's adventure, I kept wondering what exactly made Breaking Away in the AFI's Top 100, no Top 10 most inspiring films &#x85; was Dave going to win over the Italians? Big deal! There had to be something.And that something is the pivotal moment that made me realize there's much more intelligence in Breaking Away than your average Sports film, something I could relate to, and that made the ending so emotionally rewarding. Dave finally races with the Italians, he approaches them with an insolent ease, speak Italian with them, but they're obviously irked by that local clown, and finally, the very team he admired jams a tire pump under his wheel and make him crash&#x85; and at that moment, we witness with shock the collapse of Dave's dreams. The sparkle disappears with the Italian posters, he talks normally, again, asks his father for help and finds him, he embraces his friends' mood and feels like a loser&#x85; naturally, he tells the truth to his girlfriend.As painful as the fall was, I felt a deliverance to see him act normally, to become himself again. It provides the necessary taste of disillusion and the discovery of cheat in grown-ups world as the obligatory coming-of-age. When he competes in the Little 500 race against the college boys, he's got determination, self-confidence and three other 'Cutters' to take a few leaps, 'Cutters' stop being an insult, it's their identity. The final victory doesn't surprise us because the real victory is over our demons, it's not just winning but winning by being true to yourself. That's the kind of stuff great stories are made on, and it earned Breaking Away a well-deserved award for Best Original Screenplay.As a screenwriter myself, I was fascinated by the film's narrative and the way it rode back and forth from comedy to poignant drama, as a screenwriter it reminded me how happy I was to work with an author, putting all my sweat and blood into a six-month promising project before he would dismiss me after receiving the first draft. I felt cheated exactly like Dave felt when he was kicked off his bike. But you know what they say about what doesn't kill you.

Usually there is drama, comedy, and often surprising results. For me Breaking Away is certainly one of my top ten favorite sports movies, and quite possibly on my top five list.Breaking Away is a story about a teenage cyclist growing up in Bloomington, Indiana. Somehow he has become obsessed with the Italian cycling team. And whether his motivation is a unique way to meet young coeds at Indiana University or something else, he is an incredible cyclist.The fun part of this movie is his interaction with his mother Evelyn Stoller, who seems very understanding about his Italian cultural ways, and his father Ray Stoller, who doesn't understand why his son thinks he's Italian. Give credit to writer Steve Tesich whose script takes viewers on a humorous and believable adventure in this wonderful small-budget movie.Add in three friends who just graduated from high school, and this story is a fascinating jaunt with coming of age. Dennis Quaid plays a former high school quarterback, Jackie Earle Haley plays the short and defensive Moocher, and Daniel Stern plays Cyril, a student whose father likes to encourage him when he fails. Each of the supporting actors does a great job in helping to convey the story, but you can really see Daniel Stern's strength in comic acting in his first major movie role.The sports rivalry is actually established by the city kids called Cutters, competing for dates against the college male students. Eventually, the two rival groups compete against each other in a bike race called the Little 500. But honestly, the joy in this movie is the journey with all of the characters in the Peter Yates directed movie.As in life, there is humor and sadness, friends and family, rivals and conflict brought out on the big screen. This movie was surprisingly good the first time I saw it, and still enjoyable 30 years after its release. How good is Breaking Away? It won an Oscar in 1980 for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen with Steven Tesich doing a tremendous job in wordsmithing the script. The movie also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress (Barbara Barrie), and Best Music, Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Best Adaptation Score (Patrick Williams).Perhaps my best recommendation for Breaking Away is that I consider it better than that other famous Indiana sports movie about High School basketball. That's probably a minority view, but if you haven't seen Breaking Away, you have missed a jewel of a movie.

I would dare say that there will be viewers watching and loving this film 10, 20, 50, 100 years from now. Its theme and message transcend time.Breaking Away was popular when it came out. It was mentioned in three different college classes within the context of the professor's lecture to illustrate a point. So don't underestimate the depth of concept of this film. It effortlessly works on many different levels, and different people see different things in it. You need to watch it carefully, more than once, to appreciate this. But it has become somewhat forgotten, a sleeper. However, tears come to my eyes when I think about one of the key messages, explained by the father, after Dave's encounter with the Italian team. It has proved all too true, with the result that the America of 1979 is crumbling around us. In short, if you haven't seen this movie, watch it. If you don't own it, buy it, because you will want to watch it again, perhaps even 10 or 20 years from now. I've been watching it now and then for more than 30 years.Jackie Earle Haley, who plays Moocher, was also in Bad News Bears, the original with Walter Matthau. He has some pretty funny lines. --- On a bicycling note, I happened to find a mint condition Ciocc Itallian racing bicycle from around this period with full Campagnola components and sew on tires. It was a dream to ride, far more agile, yet stable, than my other expensive road bikes. I can see why Dave developed a love affair with his bike. What I learned is that a well-maintained drive train is nearly silent, at least using modern dry lube. Yet in the movie you can always hear the chain and gears grinding away, especially in the group scene with the Italians. It makes me wonder if bikes back then were really so noisy. Or whether the director or foley man thought too much silence would seem unrealistic to viewers used to cheap bikes, so they added in gear noise.Also, it becomes amusingly apparent, on close viewing, that Dave is in a very low gear moving slowly, pumping and huffing away, when he appears to be tearing down the road. But most people don't notice this. The bottom line is this movie often inspires an impulse to get a road bike, and this is a good thing if you have some relatively quiet roads to go long distances, like Dave. On terrain like in the movie, many people could ride 50 or more miles in a day once you get into condition, but with a road or comfort bike, not a mountain bike. It's a great form of recreation. Go for it!

Even if a person sees himself more in the college students, pursuing professional endeavors as they enjoy the first experiences of independence from parents, s/he would have to possess a very limited capacity for empathy not to feel affected by the fears and regrets of the four boys whose working class heritage has conditioned them to feel unworthy of attending college.Breaking Away will probably move too slowly for some, who may expect to see fast-paced and high-risk bicycling from the start. For the person who enjoys feeling his interest and tension build as situations and relationships between characters develop, however, Breaking Away will not bore him.Besides the stigma felt by the four friends for having fathers who spent much of their working lives cutting stones at the town's rock quarry, predestining the boys to underachieve, each contends with his own personal struggle. Moocher must deal with his tiny stature and the people who mock him for it, Mike, with his regrets for having not pursued football further, in addition to his overall angry disposition, and Cyril, with the basketball scholarship he could have had as well as his undermining father.Dave Stoller has the most complex inner conflict, I think. He attempts to live out his fantasy as an Italian cyclist in part because he does have the appropriate talent. Breaking Away reminds young people that they must sometimes give up something they do legitimately well when they make realistic and practical choices about their future as independent young adults.

Though it was a virtual reproduction of our lives, we were serious movie buffs and were able to distance ourselves and give it an objective review a damn fine coming of age film with a smart script and solid acting all around.As I watched it again recently, I noticed more funny bits than I had previously, especially in the scene when Dave's parents get romantic she plucks the flower from her hair as she drops into bed, and he sheds his pocket protector full of pens... I also appreciated more the nuances of the relationship between Dave and his dad, and the scene with them after Dave's race with the Italian team wasn't as mushy this time around.Not quite an 8 out of 10, but I think the current 7.6 rating is well-deserved, and would have given it a 7.5 myself if I could have.Whether still young or now old, many small-town and college-town guys who grew up with a tight circle of best friends will relate to this movie, but it's not so much a guy-flick that their girlfriends and wives won't enjoy a look into the lives and emotions of young men that women rarely see.

This is a rites-of-passage movie that plays the nostalgia just right, avoiding the easily sentimental. There are many deft touches and oddball moments that help the film to be as unique as it is. Performances are uniformly fine I'd say, with the main character, the young man with a penchant for the Italian, exceptional, and Paul Dooley really likable as the father. Excellent, contrasting senses of melancholy and warm, good humour, are adeptly evoked in this film. I must say Peter Yates' direction here suggests he's rather better than the mere jobbing helmsman he seems to be considered as. The locations used in the film are beautiful, and finely filmed. The music I recall as being wonderfully embellishing. The optimism, disappointments, whims and friendships of late-adolescence find full and fine depiction and realisation with Breaking Away, I must say, from a personal point of view. The scene where the protagonist rides alongside the Italians is superbly apposite, and the aftermath brilliantly underplayed, as everything seems to be in the film. The ending I do like, even if, maybe, it wasn't what I was expecting, it still fitted the film's tone and brought it to a happy climax.

Basically best friends Dave Stoller (BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Dennis Christopher), Mike (The Day After Tomorrow's Dennis Quaid), Cyril (Home Alone's Daniel Stern) and Moocher (A Nightmare on Elm Street's Jackie Earle Haley) have all just graduated from high school in Bloomington, Indiana. They are all deciding what to do next in their lives, but until then they spend a lot of their time swimming in an old abandoned water-filled quarry, and they clash with Indiana University students. Dave, who has a passion for Italian music and the culture, which concerns his father Ray (Paul Dooley), has an obsession with competitive bicycle racing, his mother Evelyn (Oscar nominated Barbara Barrie) is very supportive of these things. Dave has a crush on university student Katherine (Robyn Douglass) and puts on an Italian accent to romance her, but she is does already have boyfriend Rod (Hart Bochner), and he has his gang beat up Cyril after mistaken identity. Soon after this there is the announcement a professional Italian cycling team coming to town for a racing event, and Dave is keen to participate as well, but the team cause to get depressed after a crash. He does come back, and he gets support from his father, and after some incidents in the race Dave has his feet taped to his bicycle pedals, Moocher, Cyril and Mike all watch in hope, and on the last lap he overtakes Rod to win the race, and after the trophy glory he decides he'll enrol at the university.

I thought we were gonna waste the rest of our lives together.If you left a small town, you know what that last summer means, and how it feels to watch your circle of lifelong friends drift into an ever-widening ring of disparate strangers. How did Bryan Adams put it? Jimmy quit, Jody got married... It's freeing, and it's very sad. Most of all it's terrifying.And if you grew up a townie next to a swank university, you know how it feels to be outclassed on your own turf... until you learned how to get into fraternity parties by bringing girls, then steal all the liquor while the girls set fires in the kitchen as a diversion. Ah, youth running out the Chi Omegas' front door with a case of beer, screaming Save the Bud! as you stumbled down the steps, then not stopping until you passed all the parked Mercedes and Saabs and got to your beat-up Plymouth Duster. Then you and your townie friends went and had your own party on the top of the drawbridge at Mossdale Crossing, from which you could see the lights of the whole county. Of course, that fire-in-the-kitchen thing only worked twice, and the third time you were lucky not to get slapped with an arson beef on top of a black eye and bruised ribs. And by the time you'd drunkenly fallen off the bridge into Whiskey Slough and swallowed a sunfish - just a little one, but man it hurt coming up - it was time to head off to your own college days.Uh, too much information?Anyway, this movie seems to have been distilled from the pure life experience of such a small-town boy. Steve Tesich was a Yugoslavian immigrant who didn't get to America until his teens, but then I guess he did live a version of this story. The whole thing feels true, even colored as it is with some mildly hokey family hijinks. Paul Dooley and Barbara Barrie are exactly the parents you want and hardly ever get. But somebody got 'em. I bet you even knew somebody who had 'em. Coming of age is a bittersweet series of traumas, and if this movie wants to focus on the sweet, what old crank is gonna stop it?Whatever happened to sweet, anyway? John Ashton as Mike's cop brother is a perfect example of what I mean a very real guy acting human. That's sweet. Or the cutters jumping in the water to save Mike from drowning, and the confused look on Rod's fascist face as he experiences compassion. Or Dave's dad saying, You're not a cutter. I'm a cutter. Or Moocher marrying that girl who looks exactly like the girl from PEEPING TOM. Sweet is great. Sweet reminds us that life isn't all bad news. It isn't, you know.

It ran on ABC for that one season, before being dashed against the rocks by the powerful breaker waves; like so many other spinoffs of feature films, like MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, NORTHWEST PASSAGE, DELTA HOUSE(from ANIMAL HOUSE), NINE TO FIVE, NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS and most recently, MY BIG FAT Greek LIFE(from MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING).But the feature film, BREAKING AWAY(1979), now that's a different story, all together! (ALL)Now that's a different story. When Director Peter Yates, a Brit, was asked what his making this film was all about, he said that he wanted to do a movie about 'Class Distinction in America.Horrors! What, you say; we have no such thing here! After all, this is America! Well, whether or not we agree, and we and our sensitive, thin-skinned 'Yankee' feelings are hurt; the idea of getting a neutral outsider's view of things may prove very interesting, even enlightening.Anyway, Bligh me, Governor! Mr. Yates has been around and by the time of this BREAKING AWAY project, he had turned in such quality, $uce$$ful movies as THE SAINT TV Series(1963-65),DANGER MAN TV Series(1965-68), Steve McQueen's vehicle BULLITT (1968),Peter O'Tolle in MURPHY'S WAR(1971), Robert Redford's THE HOT ROCK(1972), Robert Mitchum starring in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE(1973),FOR PETE'S SAKE(1974), MOTHER,JUGS & SPEED(1976) and Peter Benchley's THE DEEP(1977).All in all, this is a very fine Resume for any Director, and it's only a partial list of his credits! So many films, so un-alike and all were directed by the same Limey! Well, if we're to have an objective look at our own short-comings, Mr.Yates sure looks like our guy! BREAKING AWAY could be broken down to several very important terms. To start with, Middle America is our location. Bloomington, Indiana is the town, the home of Indiana University. Ordinary, for the town folks we meet, the young, the middle aged. Their occupations could be described the same way. Stone Cutters, Store Clerks, Used Car Salesman, all working day in and day out. Perfect examples of what the Nobel Prize Laureate, Saul Bellow, once described as living their lives in quiet desperation. These decent folk are the real backbone of America and as they go, so goes our Nation. In our Land we have an upward mobility, like nowhere in the World, ever. But, there's no guarantee, for anyone! We all have to gain access to these social stepping. We have to work for it.All of the possible scenarios are represented by our various characters those who will advance, those who will live in relative working poverty and some who are sort of stuck between, unknowing of any future, or any plans to get to a higher station in life.We are also privy to the trials and tribulations of the older generation. The parents Raymond Stoller(Paul Dooley), a Used Car Salesman's Used Car Salesmanand Mother,Evelyn Stoller(Barbara Barrie, Oscar winner Best Supporting Actress)are at that middle age, but still have a spark of youth left. She proves it on one romantic evening and guess what? Dave's gonna have a little brother or sister!(At their age, yet!)The main thrust of the story involves their son, Dave Stoller(Dennis Christopher)and his fantasies about Bicycle Racers and his romanticizing the Italian Racers in particular. To compete as a cyclist is his ambition;and when the opportunity for a local off campus team of local boys is allowed to enter the Big Annual 4 Man Cycle Team relay, Sponsored by and held on the Campus of Indiana University.Dave enlists his 3 buddies in a Local CuttersTeam.(Cutters being a derogatory term for the locals used by some of the University Crowd, the snobbish ones.) So he is joined by Former High School Jock Mike(Dennis Quaid), Future College Boy Cyril(Daniel Stern) and Newlywed Moocher(Jackie Earle Haley). The compete in the race, which is exciting and well staged & filmed. The race proves to be having been a cohesive effect on all, but is not the climax of the story. Also, Dave has a propensity to extend his fascination with the Italians and the French to maintaining a dishonest foreign accent in his dealings with women, especially Katherine(Robyn Douglass). Like any Director, Mr. Yates knows how to wrap things up and leave us laughing. And in the process, he seems to put his own Imprimatur on our way of life, one that does bear the imperfections of class distinction. But it also has rendered these blemishes on our way of life as correctable, if you work at it.

From the very first minutes, though, I was hooked.At first, it was simply because these four sexy guys - walking around, basking, swimming - really turned me on; but after a couple of scenes I wasn't only interested in them physically, but also emotionally. Who couldn't fall in love with Eric, the energetic cyclist who dreams of being Italian and sings Figaro while shaving his legs? His vibrant spirit and unceasing pursuit of his desires are a charm that on its own could have saved an entire movie from oblivion.But there is so much more to enjoy here. As an example of one of the finest eras in American cinema, it is a masterpiece. It captures the summer, the city, the time, the people. It is as much a film about universal themes - the price of dreams, the hunt for love, the clash of generations, the bonds of friendship - as it is one about an America that is lost forever.When my plane had landed, I had forgotten most of it - I had had breakfast, some rest, and listened to music. I still had one last plane to catch to Amsterdam. But flashes of a beaming Eric on his bicycle kept coming back to me. Reading only small bits here on IMDb about this film brought everything back to me, and I felt compelled to share in everyone's enthusiasm.

His father played by Paul Dooley is a great character. Often times brutally honest and blunt, he struggles with his own lack of education and status through his son's success in life. He is fed up with Christopher freeloading off of him and wants him to live the hard life that he has lived, but at the same time he knows he is made out for college and has to try to let go of exerting his own personal pain on his son.

Dave, Michael, Cyril and Moocher spends their days in the water filled limestone pits ruminating on where their life is taking them. To the local college students they are nothing more than cutters, townies hanging onto to the past glory of their high school years. However, they see themselves in the prime of their lives, enjoying each day as though summer will never end and only sometimes fearing what the future may hold for them.Things are brought to a head through Micheal (Dennis Christopher), a cycling phenomenon obsessed with all things Italian (much to the chagrin of his father). His misadventures with his cycling bring him into contact with his hopes, fears and the future. His experiences bring him closer to his friends and his father and show him a world beyond the small town in which he lives. To paraphrase his father (an actual stone 'cutter') during one touching scene in the film I don't want to see my son grow up in the holes we cut..Breaking Away is a wonderful film that is beautifully shot and treats the trials of a teenager on the verge of adulthood with respect and dignity (something that cannot be said for most teenage films nowadays). The dialogue, particularly between Micheal and his father, was wonderful and shows that families can be dysfunctional without being abrasive. While Dennis Christopher was the standout actor as Michael, he is well supported by an ensemble cast including a very young (and very fit looking) Dennis Quaid. If you're looking for an uplifting film that isn't overly sentimental, Breaking Away is the film for you.

The 'world' he has created in his head is a place that might be nice to visit.  You almost don't want him to join the rest of us in reality. You laugh with his insanity.

It won an Oscar for best screenplay but there's really nothing remarkable about the script. In fact the story is actually quite predictable and mundane, with some rather corny dialogue to boot. It's a movie which follows a well-worn formula, the underdogs striving to make good. And you can see the obstacles the main character will face, and the reasons for his eventual disillusionment, coming a mile away. There's never really any great drama, you know where the movie's headed.But just because the movie is predictable doesn't mean it can't be reasonably enjoyable. It's the story of four teens, just graduated high school and trying to find their path in life. But it's the story of one of the four which is at the heart of the film. Dave Stoller is obsessed with bicycle racing. Italian bicycle racing to be specific. He Italianizes his life, much to the consternation of his father. Meanwhile he and his directionless friends have run-ins with the college kids and it all comes to a head in a bicycle race. Well, points for originality there I suppose. Not many movies have a bicycle race as the big, dramatic climax. The movie is hailed as being truly inspiring. That's a stretch. But when the movie ends you'll probably at least find yourself smiling. It's not riveting stuff all the way through, there are plenty of lulls. The movie does do enough to keep you interested though. Dennis Christopher does an excellent job in the role of Dave. Paul Dooley, playing Dave's father, is also memorable. The tug-of-war between these two characters produces many of the movie's highlights. The supporting cast features now familiar faces such as Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern and Jackie Earle Haley. But it's really Christopher who must carry the movie. It's Dave's story. And it's a good story. Just not a great one.

Someone mentioned that of the four of them, the only one who had any real career is Dennis Quaid. He's had the biggest career, but the rest of these guys are still going strong.Having just seen Dennis Quaid in Truth, seeing him in this was a shock -- a total baby. And I mistook Hart Bochner for Christian Bale. I used to love Hart Bochner, who in the '80s starred in a lot of big TV miniseries.The four guys are best friends. It's summer in Bloomington, Indiana, which is a college town. As locals, they are part of the town's working class, and their parents worked at the limestone quarry. As a result, the boys are known as cutters. The quarry is now closed and has become a swimming hole.There's a rivalry -- a hatred, really, between the wealthier students and the local kids, which is strange as the locals worked the limestone used to build the university. Now it's too good for them.The guys are unmotivated, without much in the way of ambition or discipline. Dave is the exception. He bicycle race. He loves the Italian cycling team and rides around town practicing Italian and speaking it at home, which drives his grounded father (Paul Dooley) nuts. Then Dave meets an IU student, Katherine, who is dating a hot-shot, Rod (Bochner, who else). To impress her, he claims to be an Italian exchange student.When he learns the Italian cycling team will be racing in Indianapolis, Dave is in heaven, ready to enter and race. But an incident there causes him to rethink his goals.Such a wonderful story about floundering young men - for some reason, it seems to take guys longer to find their way, and these kids are no exception. Paul Dooley and Barbara Barrie are hilarious as Dave's parents, really adding to the film.Basically this movie, with its beautiful scenery (all filmed in Indiana) and wonderful bike races is about breaking away from the pack in more ways than one - making a decision not just about a career, but how you will tackle life mentally and emotionally.

He plays Italian opera records, speaks in the pidgin Italian he's learned and that just drives his father Paul Dooley to distraction. Dooley was among the many who used to work in the quarry and now he sells used cars, not a profession with a lot of dignity attached to it and it certainly fits Dooley.In the end though its Dennis Christopher and his fantasies and quirks that affords an opportunity for the group to score a needed victory over the outside visitors temporarily in residence at the college dormitories. Watching Breaking Away I was struck by the fact that Bloomington, Indiana is a microcosm for where I live now. Buffalo, New York was a thriving industrial city where the industry over the last half of the last century just moved away. But Buffalo is also the center of a cluster of colleges and in many ways we've become a giant college town with a lot of students temporarily in residence. Many more locals do go to the colleges here, but are as frustrated as our four protagonists in not finding jobs here. Look at Jackie Earle Haley in a great scene where he reports to work at a carwash.In the end credits the producers thanked the town of Bloomington for its participation in the making of Breaking Away. In truth the town itself is as much a character as any of the human cast members.It might be interesting to do a sequel to Breaking Away in Bloomington to see how it and life have changed there.

What more could anyone ask for? I call this movie my autobiography as I was actually attending Indiana University when this was filmed. I watched and participated in the filming (I was at the stadium for the final race). I was also a fanatic cyclist and I, too, had delusions of being from somewhere, anywhere else. Instead of Italian I wanted to be French but it's the same psychosis. This is one of the few movies of this genre in which the kids don't get drunk, smoke dope, or get laid...not that I have anything against any of that but in movies they always turn those events into terrible clichés.Peter Yates has made a few great films and this and The Friends of Eddie Coyle are among them.

Want a movie that's not schmaltzy, but has lots of good, real-life realities and lessons? This is for you. Want to see Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern, and Dennis Christopher as young actors? This is for you. Want to see life in the late 1970s in a small, but not backward, town--what it was like for those who weren't doing drugs and getting drunk? This is for you. This movie chronicles four guys who've just graduated from Bloomington High (Bloomington, IN, in which the whole film was shot), who've made a pact not to work or do anything for a year. This movie is about growing up, about class divisions between the college-educated and the blue-collar (Bloomington is the home of Indiana University, which plays a big role in the film), and about coming to grips with who you are and what's important in life. This is a sweet, sweet (but not corny or feel-good) movie. Yet, it's not tragic. It's just a very good picture of slice of life as a kid (an old kid) in a safe town. Many lines from this movie summarize truths of life, and I've quoted the movie from the mid-'80s to today. Just watched it again (August 2014), and was once again refreshed. A gem of a movie, indeed.

Breaking Away is about teenager Dave Stoller and his buddies in the small town of Bloomington, Indiana. Dave is obsessed with the Italian cycling team and longs to be Italian, speaking the language and listening to the music. He also vies for the affection of a college girl in an almost Romeo and Juliet fashion. Dave and his friends are what are known as cutters and they are despised by the college students of the town. But this doesn't stop Dave from serenading the beautiful Catherine under his sentimental Italian guise. Breaking Away is a charming film that is plenty of fun to watch.There isn't a whole lot to this film and it doesn't' intend to be much. It isn't hard hitting or dark in any way. It is a very innocent film that isn't much more than a delightful use of an hour and forty minutes of your time. This is a lighthearted film that doesn't demand any sort of harsh criticism or intense focus. Take this film as it is and just enjoy it. It is plenty worth it to just sit through the film, which is fairly short anyways, and enjoy it not as something grand and life changing, just a pleasant little film that has fun with what it's doing and will bring about warm and happy feelings in you if you just take it for what it is.Breaking Away succeeds greatly from a character standpoint as all four of the main characters are plenty likable. They are portrayed excellently by the actors in this film and we really get the sense that these four really are lifetime buds. There really isn't anything to criticize about them as characters. They have their flaws but it makes them human. And thats what this film is more than anything. Human. It is a nice story that doesn't make us think and it doesn't hit hard emotionally, but it can be easily enjoyed as a pleasant story that is believable enough for your typical underdog story.You wont find anything revolutionary or groundbreaking here but you will find a simple and heartfelt story that will please you for the hour and forty minutes that you watch it unfold. There isn't too much more to this film other than just a happy tale of success and friendship. It is well written, well directed, well acted, and is just an all around well put together film. It isn't something I would watch again, but I don't regret giving it a shot.

In Australia we so well identified with this film, as we also have with many others like THE OUTSIDERS or RUMBLEFISH or RACING WITH THE MOON or maybe even KISS ME STUPID... but what was universal about this hilarious film is the fact that it captures humorously and generously a true rite of passage for all boys and their well meaning parents.. whether they be wealthy or working class or idyllic Australian... Even though the characters and their parents were not like mine or that of their friends, I somehow felt as though they all were the people I could easily know if I lived somewhere else. THE PAPER CHASE is probably a great sort-of sequel to BREAKING AWAY without that ever having been planned that way. What a great time 1979 was and films like this just made it so. BREAKING AWAY captures the era and the towns and the kids and the country as well as the America everyone elsewhere was interested in. Hot sunny days in Anywhere USA, by the river or at the swimming hole with funny silly friends.... and suddenly it was all over and we had to get serious about working. I ran BREAKING AWAY many times often on hot summer nights at my seaside holiday resort cinema, a small town by the sea with an annual influx of wealthy tourists who only came once a year. Everyone identified with it and they all cheered many times, sitting in a warm cinema with all the doors and shutters open to let a breeze through. BREAKING AWAY makes me love my life and 1979 as much as I loved the films of that year. It is a truly evocative film. The opening scene in the spectacular quarry is an absolute attention getter and the film weaves an elating set of characters and themes and hilarious situations together so well right up to the thrilling bike race climax. A genuine crowd pleaser and a particularly effective film for teens to love watching with their parents.

The story is almost irrelevant. You just go along for the ride (on a bicycle, of course)and observe human nature. The Midwest setting is also a bonus. It is nice to see a film set in Indiana rather than California or New York.The father-son relationship is revealing and comical without being trite. The buddies are like the guys you may have grown up with, flawed and somewhat stupid at times, but loyal and goodhearted.

I also think that every film should have at least one scene (or shot) that can crystallize the emotions and feelings of it's characters. Present juvenile/youth films, I feel, lack particular scenes and good acting that can crystallize the impact of a film. One film from the past that does use a particular scene (or shot) to crystallize the feelings of the disenchanted youth, which can also be represented in one non-violent scene(or shot), is Dennis Quaid's honest portrayal of Mike from the 1979 coming-of-age film of four Indiana high-school friends, Breaking Away. (Scene Spoiler) In the scene where Mike, Dave, Mooch and Cyril are watching the Indiana University football team practice in the IU stadium, director Peter Yates uses them as metaphor to represent the growing number of working, disenchanted, non-college-bound-youth being on the outside track, wishing they could afford the luxury of college and to be on the inside track. The impact of this metaphor is greatest on Mike (Dennis Quaid), who was the star quarterback for the high school football team. As Mike is watching the IU scrimmage, the sun is setting in the background between the rafters of the dark and towering IU stadium. I believe Yates used the symbolism of the setting sun as a metaphor to represent the four main character's own lives--once bright and full of golden promise; to that of a towering and growing darkness, leading to feelings of frustration, anger and despair. An effective, non-violent scene/shot (made over 25 years ago) that is true yesterday, true today and true tomorrow in summarizing America's struggling youth. (When I first saw this film in 1979, I drove a 1970 gold Buick Skylark--like Mike's car--except mine was a four-door. I had just graduated from high school and went to state college. After seeing the film a couple years ago on cable, it really brought me back to my youth and the summer and fall of 1979. Whenever I view it on DVD, it still makes me reminisce about my youth--remember the Little River Band?).

His passion in life is cylcing. His friends represent the gammit of drop outs Moocher, who lives up to his name, Mike (Dennis Quaid) who is angry all the time and Cyril (Daniel Stern) who plays the happy-go-lucky type.

The college kids call them Cutters for the workers who cut the limestone to build the colleges. Mike is the former quarterback angry at the rich college kids since college is always beyond him. Dave falls for college girl Katherine while pretending to be an Italian student.Dennis Christopher is ostensibly the lead actor. His character is a little too naive. Dennis Quaid delivers the most powerful performance. His swimming race with the college kid at the quarry is a highlight. There are some funny moments centering mostly with Dave and his Italian obsession. This isn't the newer National Lampoon SNL type of humor. It's gentle and sweet. Paul Dooley is hilarious playing the father. There are great touching moments. This is a fine coming of age movie.

It was a 'small' film that suddenly broke out from the crowd--gaining a lot of critical attention as well as an Oscar. Now, over 30 years later, I decided to watch the film for a second time--mostly because I barely remember it and because it's an important film from this era.The film is about a group of young high school graduates who are not going to college, aren't particularly interested in working and are afraid of growing up. Additionally, they seem to have a chip on their shoulders, as these so-called 'Cutters' are jealous of the local college students. As for the students, they seem to feel the Cutters are beneath them. One way that these so-called losers can finally feel important involves an upcoming bicycle race--and David (Dennis Christopher) hopes to prove something to himself and the community. Can he and his three working-class friends (including Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern) somehow end up winners? While a lot of folks adore this coming of age story, I felt very mixed about it. It was exceptional and some of it I really liked (Paul Dooley's character was great as was Barbara Barrie's), but some I didn't. I particularly had difficulty caring for the kids. The Cutters seemed like jerks--as were the college students. Making any sort of connection with them was tough for me. But, the film did combine nice music, a rousing finale and a lot of nice sports clichés into an enjoyable, though perhaps slightly overrated film. "},{"Title":"A sweet little masterpiece... Correction Cast list is incomplete.","Date":"2 March 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":" It's certainly daunting to compile accurate information on a motion picture... Especially, by those folks who probably have not actually seen it. Dennis Quaid did go on to a very successful career after his strong showing in this wonderful little film. Often depicted as the best motion picture ever made to date about bicycling, this film's real impact is in its presentation of the awkwardly funny subject of masculine post adolescence. What's interesting here, is that there is no mention of Randy Quaid, either credited, or uncredited as a police officer, and character Mike's older brother. Of course Randy is Dennis Quaid's older brother in real life. But for some reason, he has been left off the credits for Breaking away. OK, I admit it, I am an avid cyclist. But, really that has little to do with the fact that I can watch this endearing film over and over again. Like Harvey, Rear Window, Paper Moon, The Big Sleep, Key Largo, Casablanca, etc. It's a real 10, and like some of these other films, it's perfection was a complete accident.

That movie was called Breaking Away. Ironically both movies were released by FOX.Like Napoleon Dynamite, Breaking Away was also shot in the same small town in which the movie took place rather than some sound stage in Hollywood. Rather than Preston, Idaho; the town ND takes place, Breaking... takes place in the town of Bloomington, Indiana.The outcasts in this film called Cutters and were fair game to a group of college students that attend the local University in town, and came from other parts of the country and even the world. You see chances are that the Cutters would not go to college and would stick to their blue collar lifestyle for the rest of their days. Some collage kids look down upon this.The Cutters would face off with these college snobs (and then some) in the town's annual bike race (Little 500). The best rider is Dave Stoller (played by Dennis Christopher) who tries to mimic the Italians (and driving his parents, neighbors, and even his friends crazy in the process) in his attempt to become one of the best cyclist in the nation if not the world. Dennis Quaid was on his way to becoming a movie star by portraying the though cutter and leader of the group Mike.The big difference between the Napoleon Dynamite and Breaking Away is that this movie had more of a plot.If you saw Napoleon Dynamite then I recommend you check out Breaking Away.

Everyone hopes for the young. This is full of hope and some fear for them too. Parents can see themselves in the time slot of young and old. Hopes and fears. For themselves in the off springs and desires to give back to youth some of the lessons used in life. In failure and in success and dreams. The spoils of dreams the spoils of failure. Out of which come the hope for the future. Loved the acting and being able to see famous actors as they were starting out. Even the not so famous and the promise of them as portraits of real life. Would certainly see again. Love the Hoosier type movies and the battle of the little guy against the odds.

The central kid (Dennis Christopher) is an unemployed ne'er-do-well obsessed with Italian culture and bicycle racing; he argues with his father over the direction of his life while training for the next bike race and attempting to woo a college lass under a false identity. Although writer Steve Tesich won an Oscar for his original screenplay, and the cast is full of solid talent, this little movie is merely pleasant instead of being remarkable. The early scenes (especially one with Paul Dooley overacting as Christopher's Pop) are full of expository dialogue, the kind of bogus conversations you might hear in a pilot episode for a TV sitcom (That boy should be in college! ... He doesn't want to go to college!). Producer-director Peter Yates isn't entranced by the sight of bicycle riders coming over a country road on a misty morning; he's far too literal in his approach to these small-towners, and there's no art in his presentation. It's humdrum enough to nearly make audiences think they're seeing something substantial and evocative. They're not. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Info in lead character's info is somewhat incorrect...","Date":"7 April 2008","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":" Concerning the lead character's info, about him graduating from the parochial high school in Philadelphia in 1968, I feel that info could be incorrect. Reason he was born in 1955 and that would have made him graduate from high school in either 1973 or 1974, not in 1968 - which would have made him roughly 13 years old. In other words, he is either older than what his birth date is listed as or he actually graduated with his age group. And, it appears that all the actors in the film - with the exception of Jackie Earle Haley, are older than the characters they play. What do you think? Do you agree that the info of the lead character's high school graduation date is incorrect and should be changed?

He was pacing a young bicyclist. he got up to 60 mph,when smokey pulled him over for speeding. I asked,I thought you guys,back in the day, got extra points for hitting a bicyclist.So,When the kids in Bloomington get bored,they go to Terra Haute to find some kicks instead of Indianapolis. If this is true,how come Bloomingtons own Johnny Cougar didn't do a song or a video about this fact. By the way,was Johnny Cougar there for the shoot of Breaking Away?

I don't know why I thought so, but I did. Well, it turns out BREAKING AWAY is nothing like ANIMAL HOUSE or PORKY'S. It's totally different. That said, I was not crazy about the movie. I didn't hate it, yet I didn't love it either. My main problem with it was that I cared more about the supporting characters than I did about the main character. The story focuses on David most of the time, but I wanted more focus on the lives of Mike and Cyril. I also would have liked to see more of John Ashton as Mike's brother. Another downside, Moocher got to me. I didn't care for him. I don't know if it was the character that bugged me or if it was the actor that bugged me. Maybe it was both. Also, despite getting an Academy Award nomination for her role, Barbara Barrie wasn't given a whole lot to do with her role. She just sat there in a number of scenes with about three lines in each. I am surprised she got nominated for the role and yet Paul Dooley was not nominated for his role. He was certainly the highlight of the film.Technically speaking, BREAKING AWAY is a good movie. The directing, editing, and cinematography is very well done, especially in the bike riding scenes. However, that is not enough for me to recommend BREAKING AWAY. It simply just wasn't altogether interesting and failed to impress me. The ending was too predictable as was the rest of the movie. I don't like predictability in movies and this is as predictable as they come. ** "},{"Title":"What an absolute waste of time!!","Date":"11 September 2000","Score":"3 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":"  This had to be one of the all-time stupid movies ever made.
