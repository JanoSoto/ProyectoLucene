Fans of Pretty Woman will delight in the thinly veiled references and homages that Runaway Bride serves up.  This is a fun film, very tongue in cheek in it's delivery.  The first viewing of the film may seem a little flat, but after watching it subsequent times, you get a definite feel for the dance that is perfected here.  That is what I look for in a movie; can I watch it over and over and still delight in it? I took absolute delight in the setting of this film more so than anything.  The movie refers to the town as Hale, Maryland.  The actual town is Berlin, Maryland, absolutely gorgeous and located more to the Northeastern part of the state.  Setting is everything here because you focus more on the characters and the small town atmosphere than the glitz and glitter of a major city.  The character Maggie Carpenter is not unlike women of her generation--perhaps we tend to marry later in life now more than ever because we don't want to make that mistake that ends in divorce.  Maggie doesn't know what she wants out of life, but she has enough sense to get down to the minute and realize a mistake.  Her timing is rough, but it manages to avoid divorce lawyer, right?Drink in the backdrop of the movie, and enjoy the main characters and the strong ensemble cast in this enticingly amusing tale of love and romance redefined.

Yes, the director and the two big name stars are the same as the film's 1990 counterpart, but even though the two films have striking and almost offensive similarities, Runaway Bride has a good enough story that I refuse to believe that it relied on the success of its predecessor. Julia Roberts is Maggie Carpenter, a hardware store owner (a laughable profession surpassed only by Denise Richards as a nuclear weapons specialist in The World Is Not Enough. Yeah RIGHT!), and Richard Gere is a newspaper columnist (Ike Graham) who has been fired for printing a supposedly false column about a woman who consistently runs out on her marriages. When he travels to the tiny town where she lives to learn more about her life and possibly get his job back, he finds that there is more to her than just a newspaper column. By the end of the film, there is such a huge media hype about Maggie's wedding that it's a wonder that Ike wasn't honored for his 'false' column about her. Joan Cusack has never looked and acted better than she did in this movie, delivering a wonderful nasally performance that was strangely heartwarming. Runaway Bride had all kinds of wonderful scenes. I particularly liked the wedding rehearsal scene. The look on Christopher Meloni's face was priceless! There were so many good things about this film that I am able to overlook the superficial look of unoriginality. If you just look past the director and the two big names, the story itself is not at all like any other film. There will, of course, be the inevitable cynical comparisons to Pretty Woman, and these complaints are understandable, but people who condemn Runaway Bride as a rip-off of Pretty Woman or some sort of re-make are simply not looking at the film, but only at the names on the bill. This is a very good romantic comedy, and it should not be missed simply because of a superficial comparison to Pretty Woman.

I can't really understand why. I find her to be talented and charming as well as engaging and usually likable, until I saw Runaway Bride. I thought I was going to like this one but it offered some of the most unlikable characters I have ever seen in a romantic comedy. Generally, the audience should want to cheer for the two people to get together but I couldn't care less. I don't think Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) actually deserved to be in a marriage because she was selfish, immature and seemed incapable of love. I just couldn't fathom why anyone would actually be attracted to her. She has weddings like there no big deal and she probably wasted a lot of money between the four failed ones she had. She has her fianc√© invest all of his time into the relationship, trying to show her that he does indeed love her only to be left at the altar. I guess the situation was supposed to be humorous and I shouldn't have taken it so seriously but it was tough to overlook all of the garbage the film was trying sell to me.Acting wise the film was decent, which did save it a little. Julia Roberts gives an okay performance, although it's one of her worst. However, she is working with rather weak material and she's portraying a woman that is just so hard to like. Richard Gere was also decent although nothing special. The chemistry between these two was basically non-existent which made their relationship seem completely fake and unrealistic. It was hard to buy that a cynical man would fall for a woman that has no problem trampling all over a man's heart. They did have a few funny scenes together though which made the film more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the film runs for an inexplicable 116 minutes so there are a lot of dead spots.Romantic comedies shouldn't really be loathsome movies. The characters should be likable and engaging so it's easy to get behind them and the story shouldn't be too far-fetched. Unfortunately, Runaway Bride commits the worst sin for a romantic comedy by offering unlikable characters, making it basically impossible to really get into the movie despite how talented the cast may be.

However, I have watched and watched and watched Runaway Bride and it really is a witty romance.  What is particularly poignant about the film is the chemistry between Gere and Roberts.  Though it seems very fast, it is completely natural for fans of Pretty Woman, who saw these two fall in love a decade earlier.Roberts is wonderful in this movie.  She is completely comfortable, natural, and highly believable as the spunky Maggie Carpenter.  Gere is cocky, weathered, and attractive as the misguided Ike Graham.  The plot is predictable, but the first act is snappy and the climax is well-done. It may not please most people on the first run, but rent it again and you'll begin to see the subtleties that make it great.

Well in this movie the bride to be has anything, but cold feet. She might as well be wearing running shoes down the alter, as that is what we get to see, not once but many times, and it is a funny thing to watch as well. Ike Graham is a big-city newspaper journalist who causes an uproar with an unflattering and wildly erroneous story about Maggie Carpenter, a small-town woman whose reputation for leaving men stranded at the alter has made her a local legend! But while Ike plans to prove he was right about Maggie all along&#133; and Maggie plans to even the score with Ike.. neither expect the sparks that fly when they finally meet! Now considering that Pretty Woman was one of Hollywood's biggest films of the eighties, and with good reason, it was always going to be difficult to cash in on its success for a second time. I believe that &#145;Runaway Bride' was trying to do such a thing. Although I personally enjoyed this film, I can see why some people might not have. It did not have the same appeal that audiences everywhere had for Pretty Woman. Perhaps the cast was in some way responsible for the movie being a popular choice for movie-goers to want to see. Undoubtedly, the onscreen presents of both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere is a big deal for movie fans. I can see why, this film for me backs up that relationship. Roberts is a star in her own right, who deserves all the accolades that come her way. You can not help but like her and that great smile. Gere has had a very good career also. With movies that include The Jackal, alongside Superstar Bruce Willis, Final Analysis and Primal Fear.I enjoyed the story that was presented to audiences in this film. Having a girl that continually runs out on her husband to be is an interesting concept, which was well adapted to the bigscreen.  Though I would hope in real life that a girl as gorgeous as Maggie Carpenter is, would not bolt for the church door when you are about to commit to her for your whole life. The story for this movie was written by two people, Josann Mcgibbon and Sara Parriott. I feel they both Director Garry Marshal also deserves a mention. You could feel (well I did at least) some part of Pretty Woman coming through in this film, and this undoubtedly was because of Garry. He has done some incredible work which include movies such as  The other sister, Beaches and TV shows the caliber of Mork and Mindy, Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley.This movie also had some good lines when it came to the issues of love, relationships and how men and women interact with each other. The one line that stands out the most would have to be when Maggie asks of Ike &#150;`Is there one &#145;right' person for everyone?'I love his response -`No, but I think attraction is mistaken for rightness.'I totally agree, because I think people can make so many mistakes when it comes to looking for that right person. That is the reason, I believe, for the high separation/divorce rate. You need to be able to act like you always do around someone, in order to be able to say they are in someway &#145;right' for you, because if you cant then there is no point even trying to make a go with them.The music of &#145;Runaway Bride' was of significance to me, so much so that I did not realise how good that it was the first time. Martina McBride's tune of `I love you' was an obvious favourite from the film, with other artist including Coco- Lee, the Dixie Chicks, with a great rendition of the classic hit `You can't hurry love' , and U2. This is one soundtrack I definitely want to add to my collection.So the lesson this movie gives to its audience is that marriage might not be for every person. However, it also show that you can overcome your difficulties in taking the next step in your relationship, if that is what has to be or wants to be done, by open and honest with your partner. Warning For anyone who is about to get married or starting married life this might not be your film, then again it might just be too. If you like a laugh then you should say &#145;I do' to what I think is a delightfully engaging romantic comedy!Rating 8/10 or 4 Stars  "},{"Title":"Runaway and Never Come Back","Date":"26 July 2001","Score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I am a fan of Pretty Woman and so I was anticipating the release of this film, expecting to find it just as enjoyable.

(In ONE respect? I hear you ask.  Well, maybe more than one, but only one that worries me.)  This much of the standard formula a light love story MUST follow (a) boy falls in love with girl, (b) girl falls in love with boy, (c) obstacle, (d) union.  Timing is surprisingly unimportant.  It doesn't matter when (c) is established - it can be before the curtain rises, or half an hour before it falls - nor does it matter if (a) and (b) are simultaneous, or over an hour apart.  (And obviously it doesn't matter which one comes first.  Even the order c-b-d-a is acceptable.)  The trouble with Pretty Woman is (c).  So she's a prostitute.  So what?  It's a pity that twentieth-century writers have somehow acquired the idea that external obstacles are less interesting than internal ones it isn't true, and in any event, internal obstacles are harder to draw convincingly.Which is why (FINALLY, I get to the point) Runaway Bride is a more pleasant confection than Pretty Woman.  Believe me, you don't know how surprised I am to find myself writing this.  Before I saw the movie I was all but certain it would be deathly stale.  The premise - love blossoms between an insulting newspaper columnist and a serial jilter he writes about - screamed, This will spend two hours going nowhere at me ... and the curious thing is, now that I've seen the film, I can't even remember why I found the idea so unpromising.  Maybe I was unduly swayed by the last Julia Roberts romantic comedy I saw, I Love Trouble, which was at once thin, bloated, and flat.Runaway Bride is none of these things.  It's over two hours, but none of this is bloat it takes its time because it NEEDS this time, given obstacle (c), to convincingly establish (a) and (b).  The film doesn't waste our time any more than it wastes our own.  I was never bored; very often I was even basking in the glow.  Tastes in romantic comedy are hard to justify or defend, so I'll leave it at that.

Nor did I care for it as much as her other comedy romances (most notably Notting Hill) or most of the Meg Ryan ones, especially Sleepless in Seattle.The story revolves around a lovely young woman, Maggie Carpenter, who has left a series of three would be grooms partway through their wedding ceremony. A reporter named Ike Graham gets fired after writing an exaggerated article of half truths on her story, so to salvage his career, he travels to her small hometown, where he attempts to ferret out her true tale and get the scoop on her upcoming fourth nuptials. Needless to say, Ike does not prove very popular with his journalistic subject, Maggie, as he harasses her family & friends for info. However, he begins to feel protective of her when townsfolk mock her track record of jilting her fianc√© at the altar.Julia Roberts is invariably appealing & sympathetic in her roles, and typically this proves true in her portrayal here of Maggie. Richard Gere is competent as the journalistic vulture, Ike. I don't fault the lack of chemistry as much as the story, which simply isn't as good as Pretty Woman.Of course romantic comedies are never exactly bastions of realism, but this tale where such a young woman has already run away from three weddings and is now embarking upon number four, really seems too far fetched even for this genre. One would suspect that any prospective groom would be quite leery by now, and why does Maggie keep planning these gala ceremonies if she suspects she might ultimately get cold feet? All in all, it's a cute, light hearted, & entertaining movie with some good scenes, but definitely not the best of its genre. For sure, it lacks the magic of Pretty Woman but judge this one on its own merits.

How bad could it be for a dollar?Let's put it this way - paying $1.00 to see this film was a rip-off. I shut off the movie after 30 minutes. My wife, who likes romantic comedies, stopped watching after an hour. The only reason I think she lasted that long was she was on allergy medication and lacked the strength to push the Stop button. The last movie I can recall her refusing to finish was 10 Violent Women (we were in B-Movie/MST3K mode when we rented that one). As you have already determined, lumping 10 Violent Women and Runaway Bride together is a huge red flag for the discriminating moviegoer.First of all, Richard Gere's character is at best confused, but he is also conniving and mean. He's piggish yet suave - a great combination for a modern romance, I guess. He writes for USA Today, but is surprised when he's fired for not checking the 'facts' of his story. He tries to vindicate himself by getting the real story on Julia Robert's character, but he annoyingly turns up everywhere prying into every last detail of her life - and even though he just skewered her in a nationwide newspaper, everyone including Julia's fiance accepts and loves him. He's not a journalist - he's a stalker.Julia Roberts is her usual cutesy self. At best, she gets by on charm, and if that's all you require I guess you'll like this film.Most scenes are predictable and/or require the use of Roger Ebert's infamous idiot plot. For example - in the first scene in the beauty shop, where I shut off the videotape. I won't give it away for those who want to see this film, but just watch and think about it for one second - would a big-city reporter fall for the towel gag? Why on earth would we buy this as a plot twist?I found it impossible to identify with or care about any of the characters. Since both main characters and the plot are thin and uninteresting, the smaller aspects of the film might as well be problematic too. Some scenes and dialog, especially those of the minor characters like Julia's family and the ladies at the salon, would be better left on the cutting room floor. Most of the actors either seem uneasy with their dialog or are sleepwalking through stereotypical roles. The first 30 minutes seemed like a continuous product placement ad for USA Today and Z28's. The soundtrack songs are unimaginative - Maneater for crying out loud? I felt like I was watching a UPN sitcom instead of a movie.I wish I could find something positive about this film, but it is only a transparent attempt to sequel Pretty Woman and make a bundle.

The footage of Roberts and Gere riding horseback in western Maryland following the ceremony is breathtakingly beautiful. You can't go wrong with this movie thumbs up!

I liked Pretty Woman, but Runaway Bride is actually better. Cause as the romantic part of the story has been kept intact, the comedy part is funnier than Pretty Woman.  The only objection I have, is the the very last part of the movie. From the scene in the church when Roberts and Gere is getting married, and Robert's character for the fourth time runs away, the story seem a little too constructed and prolonged. They could have ended it at the church after my opinion. But that is just a minor problem, and I won't let it change my opinion about Runaway Bride being an absolutely good movie!  And I can't think of any actors that has that special chemistry which Roberts and Gere in fact has. Not even Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan can match it...

They don't show up.Come to see Maggie and Ike and you'll enjoy yourself.  True the film is fairly predictable, with the audience guessing at the feelings of the characters before the characters realize them, but isn't that why we see romantic comedies?Interestingly, this film is far more realistic than many people realize. Unfortunately the men and women who - like Maggie - find themselves walking up an aisle, facing someone they don't know end up NOT running away.  A lot of young women can learn about relationship strengths and weaknesses by truly comparing themselves to Maggie, and asking their boyfriends how do I like my eggs?.See this film, but first put Pretty Woman out of your mind.

But, he's a last-minute man, that is, he works better under pressure to complete each piece, barely making the paper's deadlines. One day, the inspiration pipeline is running dry and he grabs at a last minute tip to conjure up a column about a very cold-footed bride, Maggie (Julia Roberts) who has run away from the altar three times. Getting the facts seriously wrong means bye-bye Ike, as his boss and ex-wife (Rita Wilson) lets him go to avoid a lawsuit. Naturally, Ike is dismayed but, then, he is courted by another paper to do an in-depth study of Maggie, for she is about to walk down the aisle again in a matter of days. Traveling to the small city of Hale, Maryland, Ike sets up residence in the town's lovely inn and starts snooping. However, very shortly, the whole village, including Maggie, knows he's there and friends and neighbors try mightily to impede his investigation. They do this because they all have hope that Maggie's fourth nuptials will result in a marriage to the town's high school football coach, Bob (Chistopher Meloni). But, even with best friend Peggy (Joan Cusack) hovering around Maggie, could our Mags somehow be attracted to the handsome Ike, even when he's out to expose her foibles? This is a warm, funny, and touching romcom about the uncertainties in attraction, love, and marriage. How does one know for sure that their beloved is THE one? The answer here is that one must first know oneself well. The cast is a delight, with Roberts and Gere shining brightly in roles that are not necessarily predictable. The supporting troupe is also wonderful, as Cusack, Meloni, Wilson, Hector Elizondo, and others are as entertaining as they come. As for the setting, the lovely little Maryland town in the film is most beautiful and the costumes, photography, script and direction are all worthy, too. So, do not runaway from the chance to see this darling little romcom. It has some very fine lessons, love, and laughter to offer audiences of any age.

The music used is heavy-handed, from the U2 song which opens the movie to Miles Davis' It Never Entered My Mind, which underscores a romantic moment but is actually more appropriate for a suicide scene. The stars do have great chemistry together, the supporting cast is wonderfully colorful and not overly-eccentric, and it's a fine bauble for anyone in the mood for a generic romantic comedy (and, true, it's probably better than Pretty Woman, which I didn't particularly like); but from a filmmaker's standpoint, Bride seems to have been made by-the-numbers.

This harmless but hilarious romantic comedy about a bride with a chronic case of cold feet who abandons her men at the altar before van vow I Do reunites Pretty Woman co-stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere after a nine year hiatus. While the big city Pretty Woman tied the romantic knot between a lonely investment banker and a hot, awesome street walker of a babe, Runaway Bride retreats deep into the country to bring a gray-haired, chauvinistic USA Today columnist eyeball-to-eyeball with a flirtatious but fickle-minded maiden who owns a local hardware store. Aside from a couple of bittersweet moments, Runaway Bride emerges as luminous and lighthearted as Julia's radiant smile.Although most of the comedy in Bride occurs in the small town of Hale, Maryland, this entertaining battle of the sexes opens in a cozy, New York City neighborhood bar where fast-talking cynic Ike Graham (Richard Gere of Red Corner) is searching desperately for either something or somebody to skewer in his daily column. Ike loves to infuriate woman, and many of them take a whack at him on the street with his own newspaper as if he were a mangy mutt. After director Garry Marshall and co-scenarists Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott, who together wrote Worth Winning and The Favor, establish that he is a last-minute journalist, Ike hears a story that he embellishes with his sarcastic wit. A jilted groom tells Kike about a hysterical dame in Maryland who accepts marriage proposals but skips out on the way to the altar at the last minute, catching a ride on truck or horse if either is available to make good her getaway.Unfortunately, Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts of Ocean's Twelve) compiles a laundry list of Ike's inaccuracies. This prompts Ike's ex-wife turned editor, Ellie (Rita Wilson of The Story of Us), to fire him. No sooner has poor Ike gotten sacked than Fisher (Hector Elizondo of Valdez Is Coming), Ike's good friend and a photographer that free-lances for GQ magazine, concocts revenge for our hero. If Ike can catch Maggie in flight from her next wedding, GQ will publish his story and Ike's reputation will be restored.When Ike arrives in Hale, Maryland, a community so harmonious that the town's barbershop quartet performs regularly in public, Maggie is working on fianc√© number four, Bob (Christopher Meloni of Twelve Monkeys), a high school football coach. Of course, Maggie wants nothing to do with Ike, but Ike isn't easily shunned.

The plot is somewhat predictable,but at least it isn't filled with holes. I found most of the characters to be likable, with one big exception...Maggie. When I first saw the movie, I didn't realize what a horrible person she was. I guess I wasn't paying attention. She breaks hearts, wastes money, and endangers Ike's career, all while claiming to have the moral high ground. Worse, the film is on her side.By the time the film is through, she has left four men at the altar. That is four traumatized men, four big expensive weddings, four sets of hideous bridesmaid's dresses, four big stupid things everyone has to make a big deal out of because everything is about Maggie. Then, when Ike writes a somewhat inaccurate column about her, one that is still true in spirit, she gets him fired. All the while, she claims to be better than Ike, apparently because he writes bitter, nasty columns, none of which seem that bad. Of course, I watched the TV version.Apparently, there is a reason for Maggie's moral vacuity. We never get to the heart of it, though. It's either because her mother died WHEN SHE WAS IN COLLEGE or because she's really attractive. Personally, I think she has a personality disorder. She seeks attention constantly and thinks only of herself. I hate this fictional character. I am always sorry to see Ike get sucked into her moral vacuum like a dust mite. That said, this movie is entertaining and sweet. Also, I don't blame Julia Roberts.

And it's easy to see why the three would be attracted to the Runaway Bride story of a woman who keeps leaving men at the altar.  Unfortunately, there's no gold this time.Runaway Bride doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be.  If it were a straight comedy, it might work--but probably only if it starred Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and were directed by Frank Capra.  The film puts the Roberts character in the position of having to continue to live in the same small town with two of the men she has jilted, and that  doesn't work. But the movie also tries to be poignant, showing how Roberts' flirtations affect her best friend (played by Joan Cusack), and trying to explain her character's reason for bolting.  The film can't have it both ways.Perhaps the worse problem is that Gere is no comedian, and there is zero chemistry between him and Roberts.  The film's saving grace is Cusack.  The scene in which she reveals the depth of her hurt to best friend Roberts is the best in the film.

I have never been a true fan of Roberts and I was dismayed to remember why, she never changes.

Alas, this time around, they have concocted a straight assembly line product that offers precious little in the way of humor, credibility or charm.The screenplay reeks of utter contrivance as its core.  Roberts portrays Maggie Carpenter, a beautiful smalltown girl who has developed this strange and soon-to-be-renowned habit of developing a major case of cold feet at the midpoint of her wedding ceremonies, leaving her fiances stranded at the altar.  As she prepares to make her fourth trip down the aisle, Ike Graham (Gere), a reporter for USA Today whose sources of inspiration for the column he writes seem suddenly to have evaporated, gets wind of the tale and publishes it as a feature article in his paper.  When he is fired (rightfully) for filling his article with glaring half truths and inaccuracies, he heads to Carpenter's small town to redeem himself in the eyes of his publisher and reading public.  This, of course, leads to the typical mating ritual between two initial antagonists who, of course, (and I am sure I am giving nothing away here) discover they are simply made for each other.  Oh, how many movie fiances have had to be sacrificed on the altar so that their devoted one could find that one true love!  (Paul Dooley gets to do the dubious honors in this one).Unfortunately for Runaway Bride, its jaded audience was not born yesterday and one grows instantly restless as the movie travels that utterly predictable arc that seems so hard for romantic films to avoid.  Yet, even within the confines of the formula, a movie can achieve some level of depth. Four Weddings and a Funeral, for instance, managed that feat beautifully, thanks to the Hugh Grant character who really seemed to be struggling with his inability to commit to a serious relationship in a way that struck universal chords in many in the audience.  Maggie's actions, on the other hand, never seem credibly motivated.  But, then again, Weddings did not rely on cheap gimmickry as Runaway Bride does.  Furthermore, the characters in this film, both lead and secondary, emerge as amazingly shallow and vacuous and act, for the most part, like immature spoiled children.  When the film feels it needs to add a little depth to the characters, it tiresomely sends them to photogenic locales to do a great deal of soulful strolling while undistinguished pop tunes play relentlessly on the soundtrack.Runaway Bride never recovers from the obvious strain of its highly incredible premise.  Then again, what can one expect from a movie that takes place in a world where cruelly jilted fiances do somersaults of forgiveness (and, of course, find instant partner replacements) and, even more unbelievably, where USA Today provides home delivery service!

In the past few years she has done four films that in the previews seemed like your typical romantic comedy or drama.  However, when you see the films, there is something unique about each one that sets it apart from the rest of the genre.  In Notting Hill, there was great depth to her character and how empty and isolating fame can be for a person.  Stepmom, although a flawed film, showed the true frustration and awkward dynamics of many families these days.  Finally, My Best Friend's Wedding was the best because her character, the lead character, was really a self-centered wench trying to ruin her friends life to make her's better.  These are all unique and different takes on the often stale romantic comedy genre.Now, Runaway Bride falls into the same category.  Although not a fantastic film, I really appreciated the depth to her character in terms of her relationship to her father and how she never had a chance to figure out who she was, but always tried to find it other men like she must have as a child.  Very interesting, although maybe too much analysis for this movie.The film itself was okay, but the romance between Roberts and Gere was not really believable.

I also found Runaway Bride had a funny, charming kind of dialuge.  Runaway Bride was well performed and charming yet at the same time funny.	Julia Roberts and Richard Geere I think held up to Preety Women.  They are a great team and I'd like to see them in more movies together.  When I say that Julia Roberts and Richard Geere held up to Preety Women I mean that movie was just as good or better.  I also think the charcters they played were meant to be performed by them.	Runaway Bride was charming yet funny..  For instance after Julia and Richard kiss in the chapel and her fiancee breaks up with her I found it charming yet funny when after all that Richard is like Well, you got the chapel and the dress well why don't you and I you know. and Julia Roberts is like yeah I could go for that! I found it charming yet funny because of the way they said it and the expressions they were making.	For my conclusion I would have to say I think this movie was meant for Julia Roberts and Richard Geere.  If you haven't seen it, you have to go see it as soon as possible.

Reuniting Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, the team that made Pretty Woman such a hit, was the dream of probably every producer in Hollywood.  Gary Marshall got them together, and the results are magical. The plot concerns a writer for USA Today, and his story about a woman in a small town in CT.  The woman has a history of leaving grooms at the altar.Richard Gere plays the role of Ike Graham with the similar style he played his Pretty Woman character (there is a scene in a dress shop that is almost a rewrite of the shopping scene in Woman).  Julia Roberts has found her talent, and has been on an acting tear as of late.  Her rendition of Maggie is completely believeable, and seems to flow almost naturally.The supporting cast is strong, led by Joan Cusack as Maggie's best friend.  She steals most of the scenes she is in, even when Gere and Roberts are at their most charming.This movie is clearly the date movie of this summer, it's quite funny and very charming.

Julia Roberts and  Richard gear did a fabulous job. They have always worked well together.      I think that Runaway Bride was a very romantic movie. I believe this for many different reasons. One for example would have to be the scene when Magie and Ike are playing cards together. Then you see Magie jumping up and down laughing, because she finally won. I think this was a romantic scene because you could tell by the way they act towards each other that they really like each other. Another romantic scene would hav to be when their dancing on the balcony. I think that's a romantic scene because their dancing, and I think it's very romantic. I think if anyone likes a romantic movie this is definitely one you wont to see.     I also feel that this movie is a comedy. One scene would have to be when Magie and Ike first meet. Magie and her friend said they would was his hair for him, but inside die it all different colors. I thought that was funny because his hair went from dark and gray to rainbow colors. Another funny scene would have to be when Magi runs in the house with the newspaper and her soon to husband places a very heavy backpack on her back, then she falls over. That was funny just because it was. If you like a little bit of comedy this movie is also good for you.     So as you could possible see by now, i think this was a very romantic and funny movie. You have to go out and see it for yourself.

It seemed a bit uneven.  My initial impression of the first 15 minutes was that it was too rushed, like they wanted to get Richard Gere's character, Ike, out of New York before the audience has time to blink.  After thinking about that more, though, it's not so bad.  It's the rest of the first hour that particularly bugs me...once in Hale, we get so many episodes of Ike following Mags (Julia Roberts' character) around and interviewing her friends that RB threatens to become a one-joke movie.  It just drags on the pace of the film.  (I did like the priest's request to Mags that if she became Catholic, to confess to a different priest.  ) )Fortunately, once Mags strikes an interview deal with Ike, the film improves.  The second half of Runaway Bride is funnier, and has a few good poignant/romantic moments as well. It's in their one-on-one scenes that Gere and Roberts are at their best in this film, and they show that they still work well together.The romance element between Ike and Mags takes a while to really surface, and the last 20 minutes are rather predictable, but these are both forgivable because they are, in my view, necessary to do justice to the premise of the film.

The language was decent throughout the movie and I can highly recommend it. "},{"Title":"A Comedy for the '90s","Date":"29 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This comedy should be well appreciated by those familiar with '90spopular culture.  The film did not exactly appeal to my sensibilities, but it will be understood by many who are living the frenetic lifestyle typical of the current decade.I refer to the lifestyle of forming lots of shallow or superficial relationships for poorly understood reasons.  Maggie Carpenter is a woman who is completely clueless about her intentions.  She has no idea of the direction in which she wants her life to go.  Like a scared animal, Maggie lets fear alone guide her every time she approaches the altar.  One wonders if this fight-or-flight response generalizes, for her, to every significant life decision.  I suspect it does.  One could characterize her thinking process as one of forming deep relationships for frivolous or ridiculous motives.  Maggie's notoriety as a bridegroom ditcher has become the subject of every rude joke in her hometown, an indication that her kind of acting out has spread through the town.  This trend toward treating the serious decisions of life as though they were a rude joke is symptomatic of an essential mindset of the 1990s, in my opinion. Be that as it may, it is clear that Richard Gere and Julia Roberts act well together.  Gere's character's assertive approach is the perfect foil and challenge to Roberts' character's flighty disposition.  Gere and Roberts have true chemistry together.  The acting of the one complements the acting of the other.  Runaway Bride is as good a Gere-Roberts vehicle as Pretty Woman was.  This movie will probably not be recommended by a priestly vocations director or someone seeking the wisdom and self-knowledge to make an intelligent life's commitment.  But Runaway Bride will resonate with the vast majority of theatregoers who relate to the relativistic climate of the 1990s and the nobility of living without a goal; even if that style of  life seems too directionless to be satisfying to the rest of us.  I give the film two and a half stars.

Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) is called the runaway bride because she has developed a nasty habit of leaving grooms at the altar (literally.)  Upon reading the damaging article, which portrays her as a heartless man-eater, Maggie complains to the newspaper, which promptly fires Ike because of 15 inaccuracies in the column.  Determined to prove that he is right about Maggie (and score a feature article in GQ,) Ike trots off to the tiny hamlet of Hale to get the real scoop on Ms. Carpenter.  Once there, he meets Maggie's father Walter (Paul Dooley,) her zany friend Peggy (Joan Cusack,) and her current fianc√©e Bob (Christopher Meloni.)  Will Ike and Maggie fall in love?  Will the story end happily?  Will I quit asking stupid questions?As everyone on this planet knows, Runaway Bride marks the on-screen reunion of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, who last shook the worldwide box office with the monster smash Pretty Woman.  In fact, Runaway Bride reassembles much of the talent behind that earlier success, including director Garry Marshall and costar Hector Elizondo, among others.  It is a talented cast and crew.  Roberts is charming, as always.  Here she proves, once and for all, that she could charm the pants off of an audience just by reading the phone listings.  Marshall's direction is appropriately unobtrusive. Stylistically, he wisely chose to get out of the way and allow his stars to radiate across the movie screen.  The real standout, though is Richard Gere. Normally a serious and aloof screen presence, Gere manages to be completely relaxed, almost zany at times.  This is exemplified by the scene in which he runs through a field, afraid of being attacked by snakes.  I found his easygoing performance to be the most enjoyable part of the film. Apparently when Gere is not obsessing over the fate of Tibet, he can be a really fun guy.I will not waste your time with an actual review of this film.  If you want to see the picture, you will see the picture - regardless of what I say. And those of you who do not want to see it (like that guy I ran into in line at the theater who was dragged there by his wife) would not be swayed, no matter how glowing my comments.  Let me say simply that the story is as predictable as an episode of TVs Matlock, but less complicated.  The plot is so light, so airy and insubstantial that it almost floats away.  Yet I enjoyed the movie anyway, if only for the chemistry generated by the two charming leads.  Runaway Bride, an otherwise middling comedy, receives **1/2 simply because of their amazing screen presence.  Imagine what they could do with a quality script!

I didn't expect much when I went to see this.  In fact, I expected the worst.  Women don't usually run away from getting married, it's the men.  So I assumed this was going to be a really bad joke with some pleasant looking actors.  Well, I was wrong.  This movie isn't really about a woman running away from commitment.  It's about what many women experience as they lose themselves when they get married.Let me just back up a little . . . Once the 60's hit women began to demand more from their romantic relationships.  Divorce went up, supposedly because of the pill and those damned feminists.  A common theme came out of that Women were not getting enough from their partners.  (Hell, they're still not.)  Anyway, lots of men, even today, gripe about how more women ask for divorce than men.This movie is the answer to those concerns!  No one wants to watch a movie about a woman who is married for 20 years and then decides she's not happy because she lost herself to the man.  It wouldn't even be a comedy.  What the makers of this film did was back up and expose the woman being forced to change BEFORE she got married.  It's the setup that allows this to be a feel good comedy instead of a dreary drama about divorce.Some people have said that this movie should have ended before the Fed Ex truck scene.  Such an argument completely ignores the meaning of this film.  Julia Robert's character hadn't grown.  She needed to find out why she kept running away from relationships.  Come to think of it, it's REALLY annoying to think that anyone believes the movie should have ended sooner.  This movie is not about finding your prince and living happily ever after.  It's about finding oneself first and then committing to the right person.  There's a big difference.What I first thought was going to be an misogynistic joke actually turned out to be a critique of the entire western concept of marriage - that a woman has to lose her identity to get married.  As a result, it subtlety gives men the message to wise up.  I loved this film!  (And by the way, I'm a guy.)  I think every heterosexual woman should drag their boyfriend or spouse to this.  They might learn something about themselves and teach the person their with a little something as well.

Quite funny.","Date":"2 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  When a film has great dialogue and the actors to add credibility to the script they are given, then I would say 8 times out of ten I will take that film over big budgeted special effects laden films that are high on the latest CGI technology and short on entertainment.  Of course some of the most entertaining films are one that can combine the two(Armageddon, Deep Impact, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark.)  But when you put a film like American Pie or this one up against films like The Haunting and Wild Wild West, I'll take American Pie and Runaway Bride any day of the week and twice on Sundays.  This is just a fun film and it is one that entertains right to the very end.This is not a retread of Pretty Woman and the two leads do not reprise their roles from the aforementioned film.  It is directed by Marshall and it has some of the same supporting cast, but that does not make it a replica.  Hector Elizondo is a wonderful actor and he adds panache to any film that he takes on.  So it is smart to use some of the same formula that made a film such a success.  Gere has done some of my favourite performances in film, some of them being Dennis Peck from Internal Affairs and also his character from Primal Fear.  You can add Ike to that resume.  Here, at first he is someone that you are not so fond of.  He seems to have slimy intentions.  As all reporters, he seems to be looking for a story and damn who he hurts in the process.  But then we get to meet him for real.  When he interacts with small town folks, he has a side to him that is humourous, warm, caring, empathetic and charming.  And in a way he is almost like Maggie.  Because at first when we meet her, there really isn't much to like about her.  She is exactly what everyone says she is.  She commits to a marriage and then at the most inopportune time, she ditches her fiancee and runs off.  That is not someone that I would choose to call a friend.  But as the film moves forward, we see some of what it is that has her hesitant about marriage and then we get to see similar traits that Ike has.  And we learn to like her.  I also liked the fact that the screen play was intelligent enough not to make us hate some of the guys that she was going to marry, especially the fourth one.  He seemed like a decent guy that was just a little too into his sports, and she wasn't.  But that is no reason to hate a guy, it just means that he isn't quite what she was looking for.  And in films, when the screenplay calls for the woman to start disliking the man, it makes the man do things that are just plain ridiculous so that we can start to hate him and the new couple can now get together with the audiences approval.  But we don't get that here.  The fourth guy never really does anything to be an ass, and he even shows support to the two would be lovers at the end.  That was refreshing.  I also wanted to mention grandma and Joan Cusack.  Grandma had many of the funny lines in the film and she was a joy to watch.  And as usual, Cusack steals every second of screen time she has with anyone.  It's not just that her part is written homourously, it's that she carries it so well.  I love watching Joan Cusack on screen and this is a perfect role for her.Garry Marshall is great for this kind of film and he doesn't miss a thing in here.  He and his wonderful cast do an excellent job of keeping us entertained and humoured for 2 hours and I am glad I saw this film.Runaway Bride is sweet, romantic and it will make you want to hug your partner after the movie.  And if you aren't dating or married, it will make you want to fall in love.  It is a great film and I highly recommend it.

However 'Pretty Woman' this was not. Story is different, situation is different, character relationship is different. The only thing similar to 'Pretty Woman' is the two main actors and even then, things were different.The basic storyline develops around Julia Roberts' character that has a notorious habit of dumping grooms at the altar. She has a problem of staying long enough to say 'I do' and when wind of it reaches a 'writer's blocked' column reporter (Gere)he decides he's going to write an article on this young woman. What ensues is a column that is written from heresay and he is fired from his job for unprofessional journalism. In an attempt to save his career he decides to go to the small town that Roberts is from and do a documentary type article about Roberts' next wedding, in hopes of proving that he was right about the 'Runaway Bride'. And as you can guess (or tell from the trailers) they fall in love. There is very little that the audience doesn't know about before they see the movie, rather it's the journey that these two characters go through that the audience will enjoy.Roberts plays her usual character and plays it well. She smiles a lot, flashes her teeth and gums often and plays that giddiness to perfection. Gere steps out of his normal dashing character, although he does play that here too. In this movie he has incorporated a more comedic role to it. His character is more of a mischievous, antagonistic but dashing character. The chemistry is slightly different than in 'Pretty Woman' but it's nonetheless good. I can't pinpoint the difference in chemistry but it's there. Gere's character seems to dominate more of the scenes because of his slightly comedic approach.The one character that seems to steal scenes, is Joan Cusak's. In almost every scene that she was in she seemed to generate the most laughs and she plays her character very well. The one thing that I do have to criticize on is that some parts seem to drag a bit so this movie does feel long.Overall, this was a very charming movie with a lot of laughs. It was nice to see Gere play slightly out of his normal character types and he plays it well. It would be nice to see him play more comedic type roles. I would recommend anyone to see this movie.

It is usually two or three years in between his films, so when the dreadful The Other Sister came out, everything seemed safe for at least two years.  Nope, instead he sticks us with a second film in 6 months. I do not believe the film community can handle that.  His crowd pleasing comedy that is terribly unfunny would even make Tom Shadyac frown and we're stuck with a second one so soon.  The only thing I can really say is that at least Runaway Bride is better than The Other Sister.Runaway Bride is less a movie and more a formulaic publicity stunt to reunite the stars of Pretty Woman with the director.  Both actors, Gere especially, seem to be just as disturbed as I am that this is how low their careers have sunk.  It's like watching a The Patty Duke Show reunion on daytime TV and noticing just how little these actors have been able to do since.  They are listless and are not near as interesting or interested as when Pretty Woman came out.Here Roberts plays a Maggie Carpenter who has dumped men at the altar 3 times and is set for her fourth victim.  It's not that she is doing it for fun, the reputation is maddening to her. It's just that at the last moment she always sees that this could be a big mistake and runs off.  Then a USA Today writer, Ike Graham (Gere) writes a  less than enchanting  article about her in his anti-women column.  This so infuriates the rural Maggie that she sends a letter pointing out mistakes in the column (he accuses her of ending seven weddings) to the editor of USA Today causing the editor (Wilson), who also happens to be Ike's ex-wife, to fire him.  This so infuriates Ike that he makes a spec deal with the paper to get a first hand look at Maggie from her small Maryland town.  There he finds a world very different from New York (the many Andy Griffith Show jokes are very tired and boring) and meets characters that seem like a carbon copy from millions of  different romantic comedies.  As one can guess the two fall in love, which can mean only one thing  now she has to ruin another wedding.I only can remember laughing twice at this film, neither time at the grandmother (unfunny, unfunny, unfunny).  The film is boring and predictable, only letting up a couple of times in which the film seems to have an original idea.  I liked the chemistry between the stars, both working despite not really wanting to work.  Another thing I liked was Meloni as the man betrothed to Maggie, his jock was endearing and a likable performance (despite a lack of likable dialogue).  I think that the film is a poor film, without a doubt, but when you look at most of Garry Marshall's films, things do not seem quite as bad.Rating  D+/*1/2 out of 4  "},{"Title":"Julia in a romantic comedy...need I say more ?","Date":"28 July 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  The eagerly anticipated re-teaming of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere with their Pretty Woman director Garry Marshall turns out just about exactly as you would expect.

Roberts plays Maggie, a small town free spirit who has a reputation for planning large elaborate weddings and leaving the groom at the altar at the very last second. When Masggie gets engaged for the fourth time, word of her story reaches a big city newspaper writer (Gere) who decides to come to Maggie's intimate little hamlet to cover the wedding and well, you can guess the rest. The on screen charisma between Gere and Roberts is still there, but this time they have a rather limp screenplay to work with that doesn't really play to their strengths as farceurs. In addition to Elizondo, Joan Cusack does steal every scene she is in as Maggie's best friend and there are also effective turns from Paul Dooley as Maggie's dad and Christopher Meloni as fianc√©e #4.

Which suggests that those oppositions weren't oppositions after all. In Gary Marhsall's Runaway Bride, Maggie (Julia Roberts) and Ike (Richard Gere), are earmarked early on for such a happy ending by how opposite they seem to be city boy and country girl; misogynist and man-eater; harried freelance journalist and sedentary 9-5 hardware store manager; etc. This is all established in about four minutes. Underneath those tags, however, are two people who are both defined by their manner when the clock's ticking down Maggie walking down the aisle and Ike with 15 minutes left to write a story. Which is how Runaway Bride opens, with Maggie running and Ike getting a second-hand version of her running and then writing it into his column. Which is the initial complication that draws them together Maggie disagrees with Ike's write-up of her vehemently enough that he's 'assigned' to cover her pending wedding. If she runs, he's vindicated; if she doesn't, he loses this country girl he's falling for. It all gets a little complicated, which is nice. What isn't so nice is that Ike's assignment feels a little contrived, a little too functional. This is a direct result of there being no sharp turning point into the country for him, but more of a gradual and inevitable curve, shaped not by dramatic events but by the necessity of reuniting Gere and Roberts on-screen for another Pretty Woman, a pressure Pretty Woman alumn Gary Marshall must have been acutely aware of. It shows. Since then and now though things have changed a bit, however. Most recently, there's been My Best Friend's Wedding and Forces of Nature, both offering non-traditional 'comedic' endings which skew our expectations a bit as concerns wedding-movies, both of them suggesting that the happiest ending isn't always the one we want to be the happy ending. Runaway Bride could have used this to its advantage, but it chooses not to. Instead it relies a bit desperately on Gere and Roberts to turn mediocre writing into magic. Granted, Joan Cusack is wonderful in her habitual sidekick role, adding humor and a little tenderness to the proceedings, but in the final analysis it's Gere and Roberts. There's simply no room for anyone else, not even Maggie's current betrothed, Coach Bob. And Coach Bob even seems aware of this in his military-athletic way, bowing gracefully out for Ike. And again, it's a little bit of a set-up, but at least this time it's supported by convention, by the need for comedic reversal Maggie, habitually running away from men she's attracted to, will instinctively cling to the one she's repulsed by. She has to. The genre demands it. Similarly, Ike has to be the groom that no other groom was for Maggie, do what none of the others did chase her, literally or figuratively. Like the boy who brought the king water in Fisher King. In Runaway Bride's favor, however, there is at least the suggestion of a larger narrative functioning, a little tension over whether Maggie will become part of Ike's story (another sacrifice to the dailies) or whether he'll become part of hers (another groom left with a lot of cake left to eat alone), which, in a Gere/Roberts movie not predicated on a Roy Orbison ditty, is finally all we have to cling to.

With minor exceptions, however, this film is utterly predictable and the strenuous effort to produce comic effect is often unsuccessful. The premise of the film -- that Gere is a columnist who gets himself fired for writing a somewhat (but not wholly) inaccurate story about this small town Maryland girl with a history of starting down the aisle toward her groom and then bolting -- is improbable enough. The idea that Roberts as the libeled bride would later submit to an interview by that columnist is, of course, ridiculous. That Roberts and Gere will end up together is evident from the beginning and would still be apparent if the two stars were film nobodies. It's not difficult to name other movies in which the outcome is known from the start but there are none -- n-o-n-e -- in which the telegraphed ending is more obvious.Nevertheless, Julia Roberts still has the most incandescent smile in the business and she and Gere continue to produce sparks. Not a great movie by any means but still fun. "},{"Title":"Brilliant set-up, well done film.","Date":"28 October 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" The success of this film begins where most successes start The writing. The script is tight like a steel drum, and it's tones are really lovely. The set-up, which gets the two principles in opposition to each other, is accomplished in an amazingly short amount of time. Richard Gere writes a nasty article in USA Today about Julia Roberts based entirely on heresay, and she gets him fired by threatening to sue. He goes to her hometown seeking revenge. POW! This brilliantly creates the impetus for a lot of sparring, which leads, rather convincingly, to their realization that they were made for each other. Add the false ending, and, like a Mahler symphony, it ultimately comes to a much more convincing and satisfying close than most romantic comedies which always feel too easy. The only thing I didn't like about this film was the barbershop quartet singing in the town square. I think it was supposed to signify a return to a small town ideal surrounding Julie Roberts in contrast with Richard Gere's frantic NYC pace, but it just ended up being quite lame.

The cast performed with such perfection it seemed like they were performing as it happened for the first time. I commend the casting director and producer for putting together an excellent cast that really gelled and had chemistry that was like magic.I must say that Runaway Bride was much more charming than Pretty Woman. I still enjoyed Pretty Woman but the updated version had a certain charm and a twist that was lacking in the first film.I can't say what the twist is without giving away too much, you'll just have to see it to find out.This was a cute film with a unique way of telling a plot that seems to have been done before on the silver screen.

Although that never happened, in 1999 we all had the opportunity to see them together again in Runaway Bride. I personally loved the movie, even though it was at times campy.The chemistry between Julia Roberts and Joan Cusack couldn't have portrayed best friends any better in addition to that of Julia and Mr. Gere(which was to be expected).

I expected most would be disappointed, as the movie had all the setup needed for failure being envisioned as the sequel to Pretty Woman.  But, I expected it would still receive quite a bit of praise and I would spend another few years holding my gut each time I heard the name Runaway Bride.As the reviews came in I was quite surprised to find that so many others seemed to have rated the movie the way I envisioned I would.  So, I was quite shocked when I FINALLY got around to watching this movie and discovered that I loved it!  As far as I'm concerned it was much better than Pretty Woman.I think the Runaway Bride may have been a little too non-traditional for some to cherish.  While this seems to be a trademark of Marshall's films, I think this one definitely out did Pretty Woman in that department.  Even though Julia Roberts played a prostitute in Pretty Woman, everything else was richly traditional.  I don't believe the same can be said for Runaway Bride and this was the difference to me.I also believe there will also be those who disliked the troubles Roberts' character had in the movie.  Some will say they were unreal or just plain silly.  But, I didn't feel that way and in fact, I believe they gave the movie a sense of reality lacking in most traditional romance films.

I saw Runaway Bride's main theme not the cancellation of so many marriages but rather the universally likeability of this local gal.  Even her ex-fiances still like her, as do her close friends and the wedding arrangers.  She sort of owns the town in that way, fixing faucets, swivel chairs and such and attending ball games and appearing around town relaxed in several unglamorous getups.  Funny, I know people like this in my small town and strangely enough, they have a hard time settling down with one person.  Not that they are promiscuous, but they seem to have an imperative to be everyone's sweetheart.  So, I found Julia's character to fit right in.

Both Gere and Roberts have improved as actors since PW in 1990, but the story here didn't give them much help.Ike Graham (Gere) loses his job as a columnist over an unsubstantiated story he writes about Maggie Carpenter's (Roberts) habit of leaving her prospective husbands at the alter in full flight.  He then takes a trip to her small town to see if he can get the real story and vindicate himself.  The story is ok to here, but thereafter it is contrived and implausible. The minute he arrives, everyone is just delighted to tell him Maggie's most intimate secrets.  That's just not the way small town folks act with complete strangers, especially big city reporters who just made a mockery of one of their own.  Since this universal acceptance and intimating is the key to everything that comes afterward, it makes the whole story a little far fetched.Despite this defect, the characters are well developed, and flawed though they are, they are lovable.  The age old romantic comedy angle of antagonists falling in love gets a good treatment here.  The plot really produces no major surprises after about midway through the film, but as this is a romantic comedy, everyone is rooting for it to end the way they expect anyway.As before, Gere and Roberts have great screen chemistry.  Richard Gere plays a little different character here than he is used to, less macho; more vulnerable and sensitive.  This was a much more mature performance than the cocky arrogant roles he usually takes on and I think it marks an expansion of his talent.  Julia Roberts is...well...Julia Roberts.  Somehow, the whole of her performance is always greater than the sum of the parts.  She has found a comfortable home in the romantic genre and as long as she doesn't attempt to stray too far from that domain (eg. Mary Reilly, Conspiracy Theory), she will always do well.Marshall did the best that could be done with the script he had and kept the story moving along well.  There was nothing ground breaking from a visual standpoint, but the actors were well directed and the whole cast meshed well.I rated this movie a 7.

She, Julia Roberts, is the Runaway Bride i.e. she repeatedly runs from the altar at the last possible moment. Intrigued, Gere wants to prove that she's only having a laugh when rejecting the future husbands.Spicing the Marnie-like story (Remember the Hitchcock classic?) with the usual small-town clich√©s, cheap humour and some really daft supporting characters, Garry Marshall tries to create a witty, warm look at roundabout relationships. But Runaway Bride results in an end product that's not even half as funny as it seems to think it is. Joan Cusack does her tiring In or Out character and Gere's acting extends only as far as an ability to convincingly look peering. And yes, Julia Roberts is pretty when she's chewing gum and she has a funny giggle when she falls. But why overdo it? Besides, if a woman rejected four guys in a row at the altar and was the laughing stock of the whole town, you'd tell her to leave the place and never get married. Wouldn't you?Runaway Bride was never going to escape comparisons with Notting Hill. However, while certainly as appealing, Runaway Bride is far less amusing, lacking in the edgy dialogue, interesting characters and the absorbing plot.Unlike the delightful and very funny Notting Hill, the other blockbuster romantic comedy this year Runaway Bride is instantly forgettable on every possible level.

It has it's odd inspired moment (Maggie dragging a child behind her as she flees a wedding is my favourite) but even in the stronger first half it isn't anything more than average.Roberts is once again a romantic clown type character and is left with little of a character to work with.  Gere is a little better and manages to do well until he gets trapped in the mire of mushy sentimentality.  Actors like Cusack, Elizondo and Wilson are all pretty much wasted and kept in the wings with nothing to do.  The funniest bit of casting for me was Christopher Meloni &#150; I know him best as Chris in HBO's Oz!  It's not a problem to have him do different stuff (in fact it's good) but his Oz character would have broken Ike's arms then raped him!Overall this shows that not all magic or appeal in a film can be created &#150; sometimes it just happens.  Here the one thing missing is spark and originality.  The romance doesn't convince, the comedy never comes to life and you're never in a moments doubt about where this film is going to end up.  Average rom-com for fans only.

Runaway Bride is a good example of bad writing, poor editing, and superficial directing. This is a film about transition.  It is about two people coming to grips with their problems and discovering each other in the process.  The problem is the many smaller transitions it takes to get to the larger one.  They were simply not there.  You cannot walk a mile without taking a few steps and Runaway Bride attempts to do just that. Perhaps the moments needed to make the film organic were left on the editing room floor, or perhaps were overlooked by the actors or director.  Whatever the reason, Runaway Bride is full of two dimensional characters that seem to be playing directly to the audience instead of each other.  The integrity of the characters is questionable as well.  Roberts' character has a problem with leaving men at the altar the same way some people have a problem with drugs or alcohol. This is very disturbing because no matter how many lives she may destroy she is still written as the victim.  An ideology that could be affective were it done properly.  All secondary characters are cardboard cutouts with no real sense of feelings or emotions. There was the hint of an honest,   story buried deep beneath the rubbish, unfortunately none of the cast or crew were able to salvage it and give life to this soulless monstrosity.  Runaway Bride is a cheap attempt to yank our heart strings that completely lacks sincerity and integrity.

There's a couple of things about her acting I can't stand 1)Facial Expression In every movie I've watched with Julia Roberts she has the same stilted-emotionless expression on her face during the whole movie. I call it the deer-in-headlights look. She doesn't even look comfortable speaking. She looks like some child actor who is staring wide-eyed into the camera, struggling to speak her lines.2) Delivery Her delivery is equally terrible. She always speaks her lines in the same monotone-deadpan voice. It does not matter what scene she is in. She is incapable of altering the pitch or loudness of her voice. She sounds like that computer Hal from 2001 A Space Odyssey.3) A totally uninteresting actor Julia Roberts does not adapt herself to any role. She always plays herself. Many great actors do this (aka Robert De Niro, Al Pacino etc). It works for them because they are actually interesting-dynamic people and hence their characters are always interesting and dynamic. This is not the case with Julia. It doesn't matter if she's playing a queen, a mother, a prostitute or a wife.

Everyone was raving about how great it would be to see them on screen together again, etc. Unfortunately it took a little while for people to notice, Hey, this kinda sucks. And it does. It is a rather dull affair structured on a weak and silly plot line - a reporter (Gere) investigates a Runaway Bride who has become notorious in a small US town for leaving her numerous fianc√©s at the aisle on wedding day. Of course we know who she will end up with from the get-go and this results in a dry series of humorous sequences in which Roberts and Gere act feisty and exchange jabs of dialogue at each other.I have never been a fan of Roberts so it is hard for me to praise any of her performances, although I do like Gere much more (especially after seeing his performances in Primal Fear and Unfaithful over the past few years) and they are adequate together. But really all this is is another excuse to cash in on the success of Pretty Woman back in 1990 - the result was a movie that indeed made millions and millions at the box office, which means ten years from now we will probably be seeing Pretty Woman III - Runaway Teeth The Julia Roberts Story.

Unfortunately, there are a number of inaccuracies in Ike's story, and when Maggie complains about these he is fired by his boss (who also happens to be his ex-wife). In order to vindicate his reputation, Ike travels to the small town where Maggie lives to track her down and find out the facts.What happens next is- well, I won't write a spoiler. In fact, I don't need to write a spoiler. Anyone familiar with the conventions of romantic comedy will be able to work out what happens next. And what happens after that. And after that. After watching about the first half-hour (make that the first quarter of an hour) of this film, I was able to work out virtually the whole of the plot, including the ending. I knew how a chess grandmaster must feel when he realises that he can predict not only the next move but also the next few moves his weaker opponent will make.Predictability is not necessarily a bad thing in a romantic comedy. As another reviewer on this board has pointed out, it is a highly conventional genre and its conventions can almost be summed up by an 'a + b + c = d' mathematical formula. We know in advance that there will be a happy ending; what makes the film interesting or dull is the route that it takes to reach that ending.Unfortunately, the route taken by 'Runaway Bride' is a dull one. The main problem is the character of Maggie. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to jilt one potential husband at the altar may be a misfortune, to do it twice looks like carelessness and to do it three times or more suggests serious emotional problems. Now the scriptwriters are obviously well aware that emotional disturbance is not generally regarded as a suitable subject for lighthearted comedy, so no real attempt is made to explain her behaviour; it is presented as an eccentric trait of an otherwise normal and likable personality. The result was that Maggie failed to come alive, and even an actress as experienced at romantic comedy as Julia Roberts could do little with her.Richard Gere as Ike did not help matters either. He is a talented actor, but can also be a lazy one who fails to put much of himself into his characters, and Ike came across as amiable but not very interesting. The newspaper he works for, USA Today, is a real one, but I wonder how happy they were with this experiment in product placement. It cannot do much for their reputation to suggest that they would ever have employed a reporter as sloppy as Ike (or an editor as difficult to work for as the former Mrs Graham) in the first place. None of the other characters stood out either. Maggie's disappointed suitors all seemed too nice and their total lack of jealousy or resentment at her behaviour was unrealistic.Unlike some who have reviewed this film, I have nothing against either romantic comedy as such, or Julia Roberts, or even romantic comedies starring Julia Roberts. (I enjoyed 'America's Sweethearts', 'Notting Hill' and - yes!- 'Pretty Woman' much more). I did, however, have a problem with this film- the characters were unconvincing and the script was flat and lacking in wit or humour. 5/10.

Julie was great as 'been-around country girl' Maggie Carpenter (though those of us who indeed suffer with panic/anxiety disorders might argue that their seriousness was underplayed). She obviously put a lot of work into this role, and that, too, worked. Joan's portrayal of Maggie's cousin Peggy was highly complimentary. 'Dad', 'Grammie', 'Ellie' and 'Fisher' were warm, human touches (some of us can distinguish this movie from Pretty Woman), and 'Betty Trout' added considerably to small town reality. The only character I had a problem with was 'Bob', who was simply too unrealistic. About those last 15 minutes Should editing have struck them, and allowed us all to call it a day? Not in my opinion. The last 15 minutes were vital to this film because the main characters had not changed enough. They needed to learn more about themselves, and about each other. Rent this one!

It has a down side too - the plot is as thin as expected and stretching it to close to two hours makes it seem even thinner. Richard Gere is a dull grey and uncharming romantic lead and the poorly paced and product placed ensemble makes for a pretty run of the mill film. It passed the time.

Not a good omen when Runaway Bride has the same director, two leading actors, and essentially the same type of story. Well I didn't fall asleep this time, but considering the bludgeoning I received, one would have thought (or hoped) that I would lose consciousness. Runaway Bride is another saccharine, love story of two unlikely persons, who start out hating one another, but by the end of the movie, fall in love. Richard Gere plays a reporter who writes an article on Julia Robert's proclivity to change her mind at the alter and physically run away. She's done it three times, but he erroneously reports seven, and as a consequence, he's fired.  Learning that she's about to marry again he heads to her small-town Maryland home to report, and hopefully, regain his job. If you cannot figure out the rest...maybe you should rent the movie.

Come on Gary, tried to slip that one buy us huh? Overall, the movie is good, but it just couldn't stand on it's own two legs.  This movie would not have been made without the success of Pretty Woman as it's predecessor.  Richard Gere is very funny in his role as a USA Today columnist (Ike) whom has just been fired for writing a false story about a woman who sets up weddings, only to run out on the groom at the last moment; hence Runaway Bride. Julia Roberts reprises her role as the hooker from the streets...oops, wrong movie again, they're just so much alike.  Julia Roberts plays Maggie, a hardware store owner who just can't go through with the big day. This film could have been Pretty Woman quality, but director Gary Marshall (Pretty Woman) tried too much to make it like the hit blockbuster preceding it. I must say that Julia looks VERY beautiful in this movie, and I am getting quite tired of seeing that older Gere kiss her! ) My recommendation is to talk your girlfriend into renting it, and watch her live in the shoes of Julia Roberts for a couple of hours, then tell her your name is Richard Gere, and have some fun.

Gere, a arrogant, self-satisfied reporter for USA Today, gets a wind of the tale and writes a snotty, scathing piece in his column.

In any romantic comedy, especially in a Garry Marshall romantic comedy, and ESPECIALLY in a Garry Marshall romantic comedy starring Gere and Roberts, I know how I want it to end.  And at a certain point, I don't want any more plot twists ands turns, I just want to see the ending I happily paid 8 bucks for.  I'm willing to play the will-they-or-won't-they game for just so long.  RUNAWAY BRIDE messes with that formula a bit too much, and it ended up frustrating me.  And I had really enjoyed it up to that point.  After a while, it seemed like the story was being prolonged just for the sake of prolonging it.  It seemed forced.I won't spoil anything, but I will say that I loved the movie up until the scene with the FedEx truck.  Everything after the FedEx truck was unnecessary and frustrating.  That last 15 minutes or so took an 8 out of 10 movie and made it much harder than it needed to be.  Final vote 6 out of 10.Sequel or not, people will invariably compare it to PRETTY WOMAN.

Literally so she had already escaped amazing number of weddings, when a newspaper journalist wrote an article about her heroic deeds. Since his article was not based on facts, he got fired. His last chance was to prove that the story was true, that‚Äôs why he set off after the girl. And then we learn some more details about her behaviour.I don‚Äôt know the end of the story because I haven‚Äôt watched the film up to the end. I guess that newspaper journalist has finally married the girl and got his job back at the same time. Those kind of movies always have happy end so you don't need to watch them through. I think there is nothing special about the film, it is just a mediocre entertainment.

Already the story plot is more than stupid - why should a journalist take any kind of interest in a woman just because she dumped a few men? It's just so ridiculous and boring that you want to switch off after a few minutes. Jokes are missing, there is no real romance at all, you really ask yourself why so many plastic had to be produced for the video tapes of this movie - thats a case for Greenpeace actually!

Just one thing, you needed a script and a plot. It isn't even funny.  The attempt at comedy is stale and cliched. This movie is an insult.  This from the man who directed The Odd Couplefor television? Mr. Marshall could have done a lot better than this. Save your money and skip this piece of trash and rent Pretty Woman again.  Unless you are a hardcore Julia Roberts fan, this one really sucks. I give it * out of *****. Julia needs to get out of her aren't I just adorable attitude.  She is really getting obnoxious.

Runaway bride, Notting hill, Next best thing, the bachelor, blair witch project; movies for primitive  brains and shot in an elementary way. Julia Roberts seems to me a new Doris Day. Thanks to the people who made movies like Being J. Malkovich, american beauty, the matrix, fight club, and saved us from this invasion fifties style.

It should have been a great movie.  I wanted it to be a great movie.  It was a pretty good movie, but it wasn't a great movie.I know it's not a PRETTY WOMAN sequel, but with Garry Marshall directing Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, Hector Elizondo, and Larry Miller, I couldn't help but expect at least some of the old magic.  And RUNAWAY BRIDE starts with lots of promise.  Good characters, interesting plot, actors I enjoyed watching.  But after a while, every scene seems like little more than a setup for the next punch line.  In any romantic comedy, especially in a Garry Marshall romantic comedy, and ESPECIALLY in a Garry Marshall romantic comedy starring Gere and Roberts, I know how I want it to end.  And at a certain point, I don't want any more plot twists ands turns, I just want to see the ending I happily paid 8 bucks for.  I'm willing to play the will-they-or-won't-they game for just so long.  RUNAWAY BRIDE messes with that formula a bit too much, and it ended up frustrating me.  And I had really enjoyed it up to that point.  After a while, it seemed like the story was being prolonged just for the sake of prolonging it.  It seemed forced.I won't spoil anything, but I will say that I loved the movie up until the scene with the FedEx truck.  Everything after the FedEx truck was unnecessary and frustrating.  That last 15 minutes or so took an 8 out of 10 movie and made it much harder than it needed to be.  Final vote 6 out of 10.Sequel or not, people will invariably compare it to PRETTY WOMAN.  If Marshall had wanted RUNAWAY BRIDE to stand on its own, he could have cast different actors.  (Kevin Costner or David Duchovny come to mind as the male, Jenna Elfman or Sandra Bullock opposite.)  But instead, I left the theatre with the taste of leftovers in my mouth; I liked it better the first time around. "},{"Title":"Poor comedy, dud romance, hilarious product placement","Date":"26 February 2010","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Some crazy lady dramatically escapes weddings on horseback or something. A lazy journalist irresponsibly writes about her without researching the facts, and gets axed. Then he goes to meet her. Twisted premise, puzzling plot holes. Why do guys keep proposing to this creep? Why would someone with obvious mental illness be the heroine of a rom-com? Never explained.Another question why Richard Gere? He looks like a grenade exploded in his mouth and blew his face away. His vapid acting is about as effective as you would expect from somebody without a face, too. As for Julia Roberts, even playing Little Bo Peep would be almost too complex for her. The script is just the usual unlikely couple becomes a couple while other goofy stuff happens story line. But it does't work with such vile lead characters. Not to mention the horrible acting of grenade face and bo-peep. The endless subliminal messages to subscribe to USA Today don't help, either. To be fair; a few jokes work, such as the wedding rehearsal scene. But that's about it. Otherwise, this is one long winded product placement infomercial. I hope director Gary Marshall enjoyed his complementary copy of USA Today after making this. "}]
