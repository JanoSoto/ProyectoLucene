[{"Title":"In defense of She Devil","Date":"23 September 2001","Score":"59 out of 66 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Reading the comments for this film, two aspects appear as the concentration to the films perceived flaws. The one is a lack of sympathy for Roseanne's character, Ruth. The other is a lack of appreciation for Meryl Streep's performance. Having watched this film many times since it's release, I think I can safely dispute this argument.This film certainly I feel has all the markings of a cult favorite. It's dark humor, over charged performances as well as the overall look and feel wedges it someplace between Heathers and Ruthless People. More on the nuances that I feel set this film apart from others later, but lets first deal with the Roseann/Streep problem.Quite frankly, I see no problem. Meryl Streep's Mary Fisher is one of the screens funniest inventions. It seems quite clear to me that she enjoyed playing this role because there is no other way such a wonderful performance could have been created. On a number of occasions, there are lengthy shots with no change of camera where she drives through a range of hilarious emotions. How she handles a scene involving a dog licking her feet while she awakes is tremendous. I feel it is one of her strongest performances; she never turns it off, and always delivers it in the correct dosage.The issue with Roseanne's character, Ruth, is she is seen as manipulative, uncaring, a monster hell bent on revenge. Ruth, like everything else in this picture is a caricature.  This is very much the sort of role we would expect from Roseanne, the domestic goddess taking it all a step further. True, she does wallow in a mean spirited negativity, but it results in a positive outcome for nearly all involved. She takes control of her life and liberates Linda Hunts Nurse Hopper as well as countless women through her Vespa Rose Employment Agency. She returns life to the geriatrics in her care at a nursing home. As a result of Ruth's revenge, Mary Fisher at last becomes recognized as the serious writer she wished to from the start. We even know that Begley's Bob Patchett gets his comeuppance, and accepts it with grace and humility.There are dozens of touches brought here which make this a movie so enjoyable to watch. Firstly, there is the remarkable physical change in many of the characters as the story progresses. Roseanne goes from looking like a reject from a freak show to a rather zaftig Joan Collins.  Linda Hunt and Sylvia Miles likewise transform, and Streep goes from a pink, frosted confection of a romance novelist, to a black turtle necked, bespectacled writer with a gift for the post modern metaphor.  A certain tone is set when the establishing shot of Mary Fisher pink palace by the sea reveals her initials, M F, emblazoned on the massive gate. Streep is given countless occasions to do great business for the camera, as in a scene where her complete lack of comprehension in doing laundry leads her to put half a gallon of bleach and several dryer sheets in a washing machine. Best of all, she manages to give the finger to the serious critics while on the Sally Jesse Raphale Show.  I honestly don't feel this film is as bad as many would like one to think. If you sit back, and let it unfold as I believe it was intended to, you will find a clever picture that has just the correct amount of overarched villainy and cynicism as many of our favorite black comedies.

That's the funniest part!This movie is absolutely among my comedy favorites. Perhaps it was a bit ahead of it's time, I think - everyone should take a look at it again and have a laugh.As a European I must say that it is ever so refreshing with a movie with such a black humor to it. The fact that everything is over the top makes it not less attractive, but brings the so-called authenticity of this story to an extend of fun, fun, fun. It is beyond real - it is there to amuse you and so it does. This movie is sarcastic, even to itself and indeed to the Fay Weldon novel that lies behind it.Roseanne stars in her very best role ever as the ugly and poor Ruth Patchett who reveals herself as a superheroine in the vengeance department. To cast Roseanne in this role is a brilliant idea. She is obviously not afraid of being the most repulsive woman ever seen on video, and that only contributes to the laughs as she turns from the bearded lady into a business woman with a hard grip on her own destiny. Roseanne has always been accused of being a bad actress. I am not saying that she is a good one, but perhaps the character Ruth has a lot of Roseanne inside her - because her work here is in any way magnificent.Meryl Streep on the other hand is absolutely faboulos. She has tried a few time to enter the world of comedy, most notably with the bizarre Death Becones Her, but this might be her very best try in the genre. As the pink queen of romance, the Barbara Cartland of her generation, you might add, she sparkles with hysteria and selfconsciousness. Her Mary Fisher does make one of the funniest breakdowns as her Love in the Rinse Cycle fails as well as her relationship with Robert Patchett, Ruth's husband. Streep has the elegance that it takes to be - well, pink - but she is not afraid of tearing it down and plays the role with much physical courage.Academy Award Winner Linda Hunt as always also makes a great appearance as Ruth's partner-in-crime Nurse Hooper. Along with Roseanne and Meryl Streep she benefits from her physical appearance, and all three of them changes as women in a very convincing way. For Linda Hunt, cookies does the trick, and her change from dry, bitter and hardworking to giggling business woman is very amusing indeed.Finally I must say that the cinematography and editing of this movie is outstanding, as well as the musical contribution, e.g. the opening titles and the introduction of Ruth - it sure does follow the general irony of the story in a great way. Along with the extremely well-put dialogue this movie simply is - hilarious.

There is something playful and quite outrageous about all three of the  aforementioned movies with She Devil being the funniest due to great performances by  the entire cast, even Roseanne Barr.

Roseanne Barr is not one of my favorite thespians, but this under-rated little movie simply RAWKS!!Roseanne Barr is married to Bob Pratchett. He is a hard-working accountant who is skimming the little gratuities from his clients; the newest of which is Mary Fischer. With a huge MF on her front gate, she is the top fantasy/romance novelist in the country.With Ms. Fischer's mother in a retirement home, and Bob spending all his time with his new lover, Mary, Ruth Pratchett has a lot of time on her hands. She has vowed to take care of their children, their home, and do her best to hold her head up in the community. When Bob's parents come to dinner, and it turns into a total disaster, Bob begins to berate his loving and faithful wife, who slowly begins to unravel at the seams, right there before our eyes. During his tirade, Bob makes the fatal mistake of listing his life's assets. 1. home2. family3. career4. freedomHe walks out on his loving wife, and moves in with Mary Fischer. Ruth, in a state of shock, then sets out upon her plot. She blows up their home, takes the kids to Bob, obtains employment in the retirement home where Mary Fischer's mother resides, and begins giving her vitamins instead of sedatives. She then helps Mrs. Fischer to the bus for a surprise visit with her daughter, and arranges things so that the elderly Fischer is unable to return to the retirement home. So Bob is now deprived of his house, has an over-abundance of family and his career and freedom are next on the agenda.This is a wonderful getting even movie for all those of you who have been there; done that.While Roseanne is not exactly the shining star of stage and screen, she is more than adequate in her role as Ruth Pratchett, wife and mother; and in her title role as She-Devil, the personification of a marriage gone wrong.Maria Pitillo is delightful as the naively sweet but ruthlessly ambitious Olivia Honey. Olivia is Bob's new lover. And nothing cools the flames of passion like a mistress who behaves like a wife. So Bob, while still very hungry for Mary's money, is now on to bustier things. But he neglects to tell Ms. Honey of his relationship with Mary, and when they find out about one another, all bets are off. If you liked her as Audrey Timmonds in Godzilla, 1998, you will thoroughly enjoy her performance in this zany vehicle.I love this quirky little B movie, and watch it often.It gets a 8.9/10 from...the Fiend .

The comedy is so broad and all over the place. Begley and Streep seem to be playing it as some sort of parody, with Streep in particular giving a ridiculously over the top (but never funny) performance. Meanwhile Roseanne is playing the whole thing straight in her usual nails on a chalkboard way. I just hated everybody in this and wished unhappiness on them all.

While the casting is awful--Ed Begley Jr. as anybody but a nebbish is simply wrong and Meryl Streep makes you wonder why she won anything related to an award for her acting--the film's overtones are very strange.On the gender side, this movie attempts to make itself into a moralistic feminist play about how women are always mistreated by men. Unfortunately, the character of Ruth negates this by being more manipulative than her husband, especially in regards to using his second mistress to help frame him for fraud. Also, she takes on a very strange attitude towards revenge by attempting to destroy Meryl Streep before going after her husband. While her list notes that her husband is her focus, the movie takes an odd turn by seeking out Meryl's character as a moral lesson while destroying her husband. The film can never really rectify why Ruth hates her husband so much that she's going after the woman who supposedly lured him away. The film's ending takes some satisfaction in changing Mary into a more bitter and 'learned' woman but doesn't really offer a real solution. Is Ruth going after her husband through this woman? And if she blames her husband for this, why is she going to such great lengths to destroy Mary since her husband is simply the kind of jerk who uses and then leaves women? Shouldn't have Ruth found more common ground with Mary after a while? And if one sees this through a class sensibility, Ruth's whole mission becomes pointlessly sadistic. Mary is of a higher-class and is rich to an extent. Ruth is a poor and ugly housewife with limited means. At the end, Ruth raises in class while Mary remains the same. Hence, Ruth could be seen as using her husband's infidelity as a means to rise above her own station. While Ruth's narrative diatribes about Mary 'learning' about being a wife are meant to be seen as some kind of validation for the troubles of a housewife who has to deal with various troubles to keep a family intact, it's hard not to notice that Ruth at the end will not go back to being the very housewife she supports. By rising herself out of revenge, she in fact becomes an image of Mary but causes her whole actions throughout the movie to be negated. Her whole character's motivation hinges on being an abused lower-class housewife who is going to knock down the higher-class woman down for stealing her man and at the end becomes exactly the same successful in her own right. This is hypocrisy at its finest. And the dumping of her own children as some sort of object on their father completes the hypocrisy. The image of a housewife is something to be shown on a pedestal, but isn't recommended for a way of living. While this could mirror the life of Roseanne, it simply does not fit. How can you support a woman who is supposed to be an everyday woman (as the conceit goes) fighting for a sense of justice when she turns out to be the same as the woman who stole her man? This whole angle of thinking is what sinks the movie. Are we seeing revenge for Ruth, or are we seeing her fight back over the loss of property in the form of a husband which she doesn't want back anyway? And the movie cannot resolve this because then we get into weighty issues about what being a housewife truly is. By marketing itself as some sort of comical Lifetime Movie of the Week, the movie supports a position as the housewife/mother being some sort of holy figure to be supported and idealized. But with the ending showcasing a housewife 'evolved' into a businesswoman who joins the kids she abandoned as a part of her revenge to the husband she doesn't want back, this negates the whole plot. Why didn't she just dump her kids on the husband and forget about them all? The point of the revenge was to assuage her ego, which then marks the housewife/mother/Jesus figure as some sort of prison which one must escape since it was formed by a man. But since without the man this illusion breaks down, the movie instead becomes the story of a woman who seeks to better herself after a horrible betrayal and instead dwells in the past for petty revenge, hence sinking her moral high ground for absolutely nothing.

In most of her roles she is playing a funny, bossy character who we all know and love.  In this role, she is none of that.  She plays a more serious role, and in the beginning, she a bit of a push over.  She stars as Ruth, a dowdy, overweight mom of two.  Ruth is well aware her husband Bob is sleeping around on her, she's even met the woman.  When Ruth embarasses Bob, he moves in with his mistress reciting the four things that mean most to him in life.  His house, his career, his family and his freedom.  He also calls her a devil, so she writes the list down to reread, and destroy everything that means well to him.   Meryl Streep plays the snooty, spoiled mistress.  She is a romance novelist named Mary Fisher.  As Ruth says many times in this movie, Mary Fisher lives in a beautiful mansion by the sea.   Ruth acts much like Santa Clause with her list.  She reads carefully and always checks each thing twice.  First she burns his house, then she drops the kids off with him.  She starts her own business to get people to be hired by him.  (One of whom sleeps with him on a number of occasions.)She finds out he's been cheating his clients so she gets him sent to jail.  All in a day's work.  Not really, she meets this amazing woman who helps her along the way.  Hooper really helped her out.   If you like a fun, romantic or unromantic comedy with revenge on the side, I recomend She Devil.

When Bob finally decides to leave Ruth, she then sets out on an elaborate plan to exact revenge on her scummy husband, beginning with burning their home to the ground and sending her children to live with Bob and Mary.This film was made during Roseanne's hiatus from the first season of her classic sitcom and was intended to make a movie star out of her, but failed dismally, primarily due to the fact that the character Roseanne plays here is not as smart or appealing as Roseanne Conner and it's hard to get behind a lot of Ruth's actions in this movie. It's a little hard to believe that a wronged wife would actually destroy her children's home merely as a way of getting back at her husband, which is also hard to buy because the character of Bob is really a jerk and why Ruth cares about his feelings or why Mary finds herself attracted to him are a mystery as well, which for me was the primary problem with this story...the character of Bob was just not worth these two women fighting over.Director Susan Seidleman, who scored a bullseye five years earlier with Desperately Seeking Susan really misses here, but she is hampered by a screenplay that is kind of all over the place and some really unlikable characters, especially Barr's Ruth, who is supposed to evoke sympathy from the viewer, but does just the opposite.What this film does have going for it is a perfectly executed comedy turn from the fabulous Meryl Streep, who manages to mine every bit of humor out of her character that the screenplay provides. As for the rest of the cast, Ed Begley Jr. is miscast as Bob and some minor laughs are provided along the way by Sylvia Miles as Mary's mother, who loves to tell anyone who will listen what a loser her daughter is and A Martinez as Mary's manservant/boy toy, but this is Streep's show all the way and without her, this film would be impossible to get through.

He humiliates Barr at a dinner party to which Roseanne announces (in front of his parents and children) that he is having an affair. Begley storms out and Barr lets out a loud scream, her plans of revenge covering every important aspect of her no-good husband's life.Reviews were sensational for Streep as the vain Mary Fisher who even gets a Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous spot while Barr spends time cooking her son's gerbil in a casserole and fuming over Begley's infidelity. Streep is thrilled when Begley moves in with her, but Barr's revenge has her dumping off the kids on them while she goes to work in the nursing home where Streep's mother (a very funny Sylvia Miles) resides. Once Roseanne takes Miles off her medication, mouthy Sylvia is ready to return to her daughter's mansion on the hill and adds more turmoil to Streep's already growing frustration.The film also includes Academy Award Winning Linda Hunt as Barr's initial foe at the nursing home who becomes her best pal after Barr goes out of her way to start an employment agency for Manhattan wives abandoned by their husbands. This aides in her quest for revenge, and boy, for Barr, is it sweet. The film unfolds all of Begley's evils towards both women in his life, and before you know it, Barr is smirking and Begley prepares to learn a great lesson.Reviews were not so sensational, however, for Roseanne, who in spite of her dead-pan acting (already famous for her starring role on her own TV series) but in retrospect, she makes this role more than just a revenge-seeking harpy. The sight of Barr trying to squeeze her way into a glamorous strapless evening dress is humiliating visually but many women could probably identify, and while they might not seek the same time of War of the Roses style revenge, enjoyed it on screen. Daytime soap star A. Martinez adds comic Latin sexuality to the studly butler tossed aside by Streep, while another soap veteran, Doris Belack, is memorable as Streep's agent. Mary Louise Wilson is delightfully imperious as Barr's boss at the retirement home.If the film focuses mainly on Streep, Barr and Begley, the real credit thought must go to Susan Seidelman, the film's director, who prevents the film from becoming a man-bashing women's lib fest. Men can see the growing frustration in Barr's sometimes grossly dowdy character, and in the end, you really can see why she might all of a sudden quote Peter Finch in Network and scream, I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!

I truly thought (from the previews) that it would be hilarious to see the juxtaposition of Meryl Streep's proper and glamorous character with Roseanne's crude and ugly lout.  Boy was I wrong.The first disappointment is that Streep and Roseanne appear in only two scenes together, disallowing the possibility of numerous odd-couple moments between the two women.  The second (and most glaring) disappointment is the unsatisfying story and unbelievable characters.  C'mon, Ed Begley Jr. as a philandering ladies' man?  And the underlying lesson I guess I was supposed to learn was that being manipulative and vindictive can gain you fame and fortune, and make you a better woman.  I felt that, in the final scene where Roseanne is walking down the street toward us, the director wanted all of us in the audience to be standing up and applauding this glorious and wonderful woman, along with all the great things she had done.  I didn't want to cheer for Roseanne, and I resented the implied manipulation of this scene.I would also have to agree with the above review (What Was Meryl Streep Thinking???) which pointed out the dreadful house-blowing-up incident. Even though it has been over 10 years since I've seen this film, that image is still burned into my mind, watching Roseanne walk away from a large-screen projection of a videotaped house explosion.Not only did this embarrassingly bad movie (considering the cast) make Siskel & Ebert's 10 Worst Movies Of The Year list, but it is the first title I call to mind whenever I am asked about the worst movies I've ever seen.

You would think a movie with this cast and great source material would be a lot better than it is but it's not. Though a film's failure cannot be blamed on just one thing, for this film, the lion's share belongs to the director, Susan Seidelman. Her direction is flat and unimaginative. She shot She Devil like it was a TV movie. It certainly looks like it. There's no spark or liveliness to it. It's point and shoot direction. This is acceptable when the actors and the material are solid but here they are not. As good as Roseanne Barr (or Arnold or whatever last name she was or wasn't using at the time) was on her TV show, here she's as flat as Seidelman's direction and since she's the center of the film, it nearly kills it. I think our sympathies were supposed to rest firmly with Roseanne's character Ruth but since she is presented so negatively, we cannot understand why her husband (or anyone) would have been attracted to her in the first place. She comes across as gross and incompetent. There's nothing at stake when she seeks revenge on Bob for leaving her because neither character feels worth the time.The whole movie would have been forgotten if it had not been for one thing the unbelievable, incredible, tour-de-force comic performance of Meryl Streep. Every single scene she is in is a comic whopper. When she is on screen, the whole movie suddenly jolts to life. Streep's acting skills often rely on capturing the smallest of nuances and in She Devil she nails them perfectly. Her Mary Fisher is a woman addicted to the impossible dream of perfect romance. Every word out of her mouth is whispery affirmation of it. She is so good that we end up rooting for her and worse, feeling sorry for her. Streep's best scene (and they are all good) comes about midway when Bob (now cheating on her) comes home late. Streep, on all fours, wags her fanny as she exclaims she's an artist. Brilliant.

And say what you will about this movie, I really liked her in this.She isn't just an artist. She is thee artist in Hollywood. From this viewing or many, MANY, more when I was a child, she appears to have taken this role very seriously. Much like when I watched Megan Mullally perform live as Karen Walker at a taping of Will & Grace. Both Karen, and Streep's Mary Fisher are silly roles, and yet they're treated professionally.I appreciate that. And the movie.Now, far from perfect &#x96; and I'm not even speaking of the terrible FX (SEE the house blow up and how Roseanne Barr is nowhere near that,) it's a fun watch. It's fun that Barr's Ruth is not Barr's normal role, like in her &#x96; at the time, future &#x96; role on her hit TV show. I liked how she had a plan of revenge, or more accurately justice, and didn't have to stoop to lowbrow humor as Melissa McCarthy has to do today. In fact, I would back this Ruth over any of McCarthy's ladies I've seen on screen.I digress. Housewife Ruth's husband cheats on her with famed romance novelist, Mary and she devotes her time to tearing down the things that he states mean the most to him.That's it, for the premise, at least. There are a lot of funny moments, good secondary characters, and Maria Pitillo, who I recently reviewed in 1998's Godzilla, and oddly dropped off the Hollywood map 5 years ago. Anyways, I liked how it wasn't straight forward for Ruth. She grew as a person and had to continually improvise and adapt for her plan to work.And Streep's Mary, was a fun watch, especially when you can see she's not the dumb blonde she mostly portrays. Note the glasses push-up.Sure, it's predictable and some scenes are pretty far-fetched, but it was fun when I was growing up with this as it is today. I liked the soundtrack, some of the lines and the relationships Ruth makes during her journey. And I definitely understand more of what they were saying now, than I did as a kid. Totally recommended.

The opening credits consists on a delicate and feminine music, a Santa Barbara- like cursive writing, and several shots of glamorous women putting on some make-up, lipstick or perfume, like in these corny cosmetic ads, so typical of the 80's. In fact, the whole intro is so cliché that we expect a punch-line. And rightfully, we get one when emerges the face of Rita, Roseanne Barr as the unpleasant, plump, average-looking and (not yet) desperate housewife, the soon-to-be She-Devil.Roseanne Barr, whose breakthrough role in Roseanne had already launched her career; has never been considered a beautiful woman, yet she still pushes herself to the most atrocious physical limits by adding a big mole on her upper lip. It takes some great deal of courage to abuse one's own image, but it's essential to recreate the perfect contrast with Meryl Streep, who incarnates Rita's nemesis, a rich roman rose writer, beautiful, blonde, distinguished and literate, a caricature in all pinkness and sophistication. The film is often credited for featuring the first comedic role of the ultimate drama actress. Is she good? Delightfully Streep's capability to caricature herself and play a woman who takes herself so seriously almost works like a refreshing self-derision, deserving the Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy.The opposition between Rita and Mary is the core of the story; the whole narrative depends on our empathy toward the ugly duckling and our sadistic delight to see the beautiful princess' life falls apart. Oddly enough, Mary and Rita hardly interact. The intercessor is Bob, Rita's unfaithful husband played by Ed Begley Jr., probably the only actor whose hair can compete with Meryl Streep's. With his tall and athletic body and his elegant demeanor, it's a wonder how he and Rita ended up together. When Mary finds out he's married, it's too bad she says, to which he replies it's too late not to have some sex though. Indeed, after Rita dropped some drink on Mary's pink dress, he apologetically suggests driving her home. What did Rota expect? Still, although she suspects Bob to be screwing around, she gives him the benefit of the doubt. It's not until a disastrous dinner in front of her stepparents that Bob can't take it anymore and leaves the house. He then delivers the film's pivotal rant, against his wife. Rita remains silent, contemplating the failure of her own marriage while Bob lists the four assets he most valued a house, a family, a career and freedom. Not part of them, Rita decides to destroy these sacred pillars one by one. At least, she'd deserve to be called a liability, and worse, a she-devil. The film turns into a delightful revenge comedy, working like a missing link between two movies of the same year  Look Who's Talking and The War of the Roses.Like Look Who's Talking, She Devil is a sweet and entertaining family comedy appealing to a younger audience while the main target are adults; it has its share of goofiness and physical humor, but under the surface, there is a lot of wit and sensitivity. I guess it's not a coincidence that both movies were released by women, which might explain the choice of tone, apparently sweet enough to hide a good amount of bitterness, like a frail and fragile woman hiding a burning flame inside her heart, like all the everyday heroines of Rita's employment center. And the film works thanks to this distance, this capability to turn every situation into something both insightful and comical, it's almost like a trick so the movie could win men's hearts despite its feminist undertones.Take the scene where Rita, who had just destroyed the house, sends the kids to Mary's house, to break up her idyllic routine with Bob. This is one of the movies' funniest and smartest moves while many mothers would have played the victim card and console themselves by keeping the kids (which any cheating husband would expect), Rita doesn't lament on herself, and just reverse the roles between the mistress and the housewife. With more free time, she works as a nurse in a hospice where she teams up with Hooper (Linda Hunt) another woman touched by an ungrateful looks. Then, she manages to get Mary's mother (Sylvia Miles) off the house. The mother is another scene-stealer, finishing the mayhem started by the kids, and ruining all the facade Mary built during her successful career, starting with her age.And the marital conflict, the whole love-and-hate relationship between Bob and Rita reminds of The War of the Roses, a superior masterpiece of Black humor starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. She Devil, with a bit of schmaltz's, is as politically incorrect and even flirts with very borderline humor, having a luscious butler (played by A. Martinez) flirting with Rita's teenage daughter and some implicit sex scenes &#x85; the film assumes some crudeness even though it tries to sugarcoat it. And while we empathize with Rita's feminist career, it's impossible not to resist to Ed Begley as the victim. Yet we know we're watching a slow but possible redemption. The same goes for Mary Fisher who learns not to take her success for granted and tries to change.This is what elevates the film above the basic standards of comedy its characters play like archetypes, but they do change for the best. The ending has something very inspirational the looks on Roseanne while she walks and smiles surrounded by an army of female underdogs during the You Look Like an Angel song is almost beautiful. And then we understand why she had to be so 'ugly' at the start, less for the contrast with Streep than with herself at the end, which is even more satisfying.She might have looked like a devil, but she was an angel in disguise.

This was NOT a funny subject.The original series was engrossing and you felt for the fat, really ugly suburban neglected wife at the end. She slowly and methodically got her crappy husband back. To be honest, Roseanne could have been even more fatter and uglier in the beginning; and her transformation to the 'she-devil' over the years could have been more dramatic. They did not let Roseanne BE Roseanne in this. If they did, she would have mop the floor with this role.When I heard that Roseanne was cast for this film against Meryl Streep, what a good contrast and choice! Meryl was great! Old enough, pretty enough, vapid enough, spoiled enough - but then again, Meryl wasn't allowed to be... Meryl! She was phenomenal in transitions back then and needed that here if the script was serious.Bagley was a good choice for the crap husband; but Eric Roberts would have been devilishly better if they kept with the seriousness of the book and BBC series.I saw the TV series first, and week by week it kept me riveted back then. Then read the book and by that time, this film was being done. When I saw the film (on cable) finally, I was pretty ticked. The casting was right for all, the script was horrid.Maybe someone in America needs to look at the book again soon, and this time do it with the seriousness it was. Yeah, you'll initially hate the she-devil, but you'll hate the folks around her more and at some point start rooting for her as she climbs UP through the muck of her boring life, of letting herself go thinking her life was fine and it was not, and her adulterous thoughtless, degrading husband.

This was one of the reasons I downloaded this somewhat obscure movie. Roger Ebert's generous review was another reason (He gave it a surprising 3 out of 4 stars and praised both Roseanne and Meryl).The movie's plot is taut and simple, under-appreciated and unattractive housewife Ruth (Roseanne) envies beautiful women and does her best to bring her husband Bob (Ed) to the bed. Unfortunately, her husband has malicious eyes that cannot resist perfect female anatomy (no straight men can resist, but this man's a womanizer) and is easily allured by a popular romantic authoress Mary Fisher (Meryl), who in her interviews is shown to have an unblemished life. When Mary and Bob get intimate and Rob leaves Ruth, Ruth seeks revenge against Rob and Meryl. For this she has to destroy Bob's assets (thank god it isn't Rob's jewels, because that would've been painful!)-his home, his new family, career and freedom. This makes Ruth a 'She-Devil'.Jane Lynch would've nailed this role; the vindictive nature creased with an emotional touch that her character in Glee has is superbly conceived by Jane. Roseanne is however mediocre; she is like 'Precious' from the movie of the same name, playing Ruth, with slight laggardness does not make her character very likable.Meryl, on the other hand gives more skin to her character; I read a number of reviews that lambast her performance for being too wooden. Her character is uppity and pretentious, what more can she do? I've seen some high-class, good-for-nothing people talk and behave the same touch-me-not way, and Meryl gets that right. An exaggeration would have ruined her performance, since both Roseanne and Sylvia Miles (who plays Mrs. Fisher)'s characters are overly exaggerated. It's not an award-worthy performance, but it's great for a comedy. Some of her best scenes include (i) the outburst at her mother (ii) the bubble-bath-love scene when the kid interrupts and asks about the satellite dish and she gracefully turns around and goes back (iii) the last outburst. The supporting cast is all ordinary, with the only exception being Sylvia who is better-than-ordinary.Now there are some fundamental problems with the story, because of which I could not sympathize with Ruth. The major one, that has been mentioned in some other reviews too, is her actual revenge that is aimed at Mary rather than Ed. It's like the recent controversy in Karnataka, India, where the paramour of a top regional actor was banned for three years from the film industry after the wife of the actor complained to the police that the husband had beaten her up when she had confronted him regarding the affair. Here at least the wife and the law used their head and got the man arrested and lifted the ban on the actress. Ruth however destroys Mary for majority of the film and then targets Ed, though Ed seems more licentious.Another problem is with the consequences of the events. Ruth starts and employment agency to help women then makes them her weapons and on top of that almost destroys a woman's career. If in the ending, Meryl had gone to Ruth, apologized and made Ruth her publisher, and then it would've had a better alls-well-that-ends-well ending. This is Mary becoming Ruth and Ruth becoming Mary which is somewhat disturbing since I can't say then that Mary deserved it. Also, Bob never turns a better man, and Ruth forgiving him is just pathetic. Bob actually deserved a good pummeling.The movie falls short on laughs, and fails to provide justice to all the characters, especially the children who become spoilt towards the end (like most of the Disney girls).My Rating 3/10 "},{"Title":"Underrated","Date":"5 June 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This movie was made early on in Roseanne's TV career.

But this film has been on TV and cable several times. It stars Roseanne Barr in a terrific performance as Ruth Patchett, a frumpy, fat and under-appreciated suburban housewife with two kids. Her husband, Bob, indulges in an affair with a fabulously wealthy romance novelist Mary Fisher. She lives in a pink house by the ocean. When she and Bob become lovers, Ruth is resolved to get her revenge and possibly win her husband back at the same time. Throughout the film, she methodically extracts his punishment. She first kicks him out of the house. He naturally moves in with Mary Fisher in her mansion, but Ruth also dumps the kids on him. Now Mary Fisher must serve as mother to the kids and suffer the same treatment Ruth endured. Her novels begin to lose their old magic and she finds herself aging and unattractive. Ruth manipulates things so that her shrewish mother (Sylvia Miles) moves in with Ruth, this accomplished by posing as a nurse in the convalescent home where she was lodged. Roseanne's plot actually works, as ultimately, Bob lands in jail for his embezzlements. Ruth and Bob care for the kids, even if Bob is still in jail. The story is dark, humorous and contains a strong women's empowerment theme. Rather than just taking her husband's betrayal, she gets even. I wish more women could do this! It's a wonderfully-written and enjoyable film. Meryl Streep as Mary Fisher is comical, bitchy, and the type you love to hate. There is much to admire in how this film serves as revenge fantasy, even if it's unrealistic. I really found this to be a great movie. Check it out.

The movie is great because Bob in the movie cheats on all the women and they all find some sort of way to get revenge on him. It's such a funny and dark comedy because it really shows how women can be more backstabbing. I also liked this movie because not only does Ruth get revenge on her husband she also gets revenge on his romantic novelist turned housewife mistress.One thing that I didn't like about this movie was the clothing but that was the eighties. In the end, Ruth almost feels sorry for Bob. Almost. It's a good movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon.

In fact, every time I have seen this movie, I can't help but laugh. Anyway, for those who have not seen this movie, Rosanne Barr (this was before she dropped the Barr from her stage name) plays a frumpy housewife named Ruth Patchett whose husband is an accountant named Bob played by Ed Begley Jr. She goes to a party with him and it is there that he meets Meryl Streep (Mary Fisher), who is a famous writer of romance novels. Shortly after their meeting one another, Bob begins an affair with Mary Fisher. When Ruth discovers this, she comes up with a revenge plan of her own by making a list of Bob's most important assets Home, Family, Career and Freedom. One by one, she destroys all four of them in a wicked and comical way. Hence, the title SHE DEVIL. There are a lot of funny parts to it like when Mary tries to do the laundry and puts bleach in it thinking it is detergent as well as when Ruth gets together with a former employee of Bob's named Olivia and they come up with a scheme to frame Bob. Anyway, I have this movie on video tape and I recommend it to anyone who loves slapstick comedy and/or loves Meryl Streep as she is great in this role. Sylvia Miles plays Meryl Streep's mother and she is a riot. The same thing goes for Rosanne as well.

I don't think its fair to critcize someone for taking a part in a movie that is not PERFECTLY suited to that person, or if the movie is of a genre that the person is unfamiliar with. She is better than the movie, obviously, but that does not mean the movie has no value whatsoever.  There are good scenes between Linda Hunt and Roseann, and Sylvia Miles gets a laugh or two as Meryl's mother. A Martinez is perfect as Meryl's boy-toy, and the movie is not that bad at all.  Why director Susan Seidelman insists on badmouthing New Jersey every chance she gets is very annoying, though.

A great ensemble cast (loved Linda Hunt especially, and A Martinez was made for the role of Garcia!) I think the special effects were supposed to be cheesy.

She gives a good performance that wins you over by the end. Meryl Streep as the author overacts enormously, and it is horrifying to think that women like the one she's playing actual exist. Today, I see a vague hint of Harry Potter author JK Rowling in her performance - an absurdly beautiful and intelligent woman who lives in a self-created world of her own. Ed Begley Jr is also watchable as the mindless husband caught in between them.The posters for this movie are actually misleading - Barr and Streep never have a punch-up although they inflict a lot of pain on each other and themselves.Worth watching - but you need a strong stomach to swallow the movie's message.

In She Devil (and this is a must watch movie ) she has performed a role at odds with her persona with grace and panache.The fast aging author unhappy without a man in her life is played to perfection. The scene in which Meryl Streep is just getting out of bed and mistakes the dog licking her toes for the man in her life is exceptionally well played.She uses her fully clothed behind to communicate the frustration so exceedingly well it is a scene which stays firmly etched in the mind.It is great to see the movie breaking typecasts and stereotypes and unravels like a fairy tale the female version of David taking on Goliath.

The movie has frumpy housewife Ruth Patchett (Roseanne Barr) taking revenge on her womanizing husband Bob (Ed Begley Jr) after he dumps her and moves in with trashy airhead novelist Mary Fisher (Streep).This is one of those movies that you gotta love from every aspect. A really funny scene involves Mary's embarrassing attempt to use a washer it just goes to show that celebrities should not operate heavy machinery (or anything, for that matter). Linda Hunt, as a nurse, also adds a good characterization to the movie. A great movie in every way.

The most interesting thing about She-Devil is that ironically, just as it introduces some humility into her character Mary Fisher's life, Meryl Streep is brought down to the gutter just for associating with this stinker.  I hope they paid her a fortune.  Don't get me wrong--there were moments where I laughed (such as when the prize poodle plays its last game of fetch!), but this was a low-rate film with a script that had unbelievable holes big enough to drive a Mack truck right on through.  Normally in a silly comedy that is just fine, but these were so glaring that common sense did not allow me to enjoy the movie (and the blue-screen of the house blowing up while Rosanne walks away is just terrible!).  For example, why would Bob Patchett have knocked up Roseanne's hideous character to begin with?  And if the She-Devil really loved her kids would she really just leave them with her husband and his mistress for a few months?  The only reason this movie got higher than a 2 or 3 was due to Meryl's portrayal of the slutty, sexy main character played off against Roseanne's convincing act(?) as a disgusting person (the mole on her mustached face is truly gross).  Also, the woman who plays Mary Fisher's mom is a hoot.  The ending of this movie was terrible with no real resolution other than the fact that the She-Devil got even by completing a demolition list on her ex-husband.  I guess we are to believe that she has transcended into a likeable, attractive, confident woman, but in fact she is just a crafty witch who used her friend's money to get even with her cheating husband.  I recommend this movie if you are really, really bored and can find absolutely nothing else to do.  Otherwise, unless you are a Meryl Streep fan (who is really very sexy in a twisted sort of way throughout this film) who wants to see her doing something different, don't waste your time.

I'm sympathetic to the theme (and deriving comedy from it) but this is just a misfire. For starters in answer to the question everyone was asking when this came out.. No Meryl Streep cannot do comedy. I can't imagine she's ever told a joke.Part of her problem is that as a self-impressed diva, she can't bear to fit herself into the scale of a movie. She's too freaking needy for that. Her self-conscious technique continually takes you out of the world of her movies, and standing amidst the ruins, all that's left for dazed viewers is to fawn appreciatively over her ability. Apparently this trick got old for her too, and in an effort to develop some range, she began to choose absurdly inappropriate material that only further proved she had no versatility; this, Death Becomes Her, The River Wild. Can she do comedy? No, but she can't do adventure either.On the Actors studio when James Lipton asked what her least favorite word was, Streep sneered edgy! Perhaps this is because in her whole career she has only mastered earnest. She couldn't do edgy if she was holding Lee Strasberg at gunpoint. She's too cerebral. She botches everything but drama.In an effort to say something nice about her, she was good in both Fred Schepisi films twenty years ago; Plenty and A Cry in the Dark. "}]
