I discovered this movie on video and it will definitely become a part of my collection.In the 1940's, during World War II, things are rough in the USA. Willie Morris is not your average boy.  He would rather read than play football with the other guys.   When Willie's parents let him have a dog, it changes his whole outlook on life.  He and his dog Skip have a unique friendship that becomes unmatched by anything else.While this movie's target audience are kids half my age, it is perfect for everyone.  Its story is very true to life, probably because it's based on Willie Morris' own childhood and his memoir of the same name.  I had a dog that was just like Skip -- a true friend.  There's nothing like a constant companion that will stick by you even when it seems that the world is against you.  Even if you're not a dog fan, you shouldn't look past this movie.The cast is excellent, especially Frankie Muniz, who's now known as Malcolm from Fox's Malcolm in the Middle.  He exudes boyhood innocence and bonds with his pet better than he does with humans.  His parents, Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon, do a fine job as well. Rounding out the major cast is Luke Wilson, as Willie's changed-by-war neighbor Dink.My Dog Skip is funny and heartwarming.  You'll laugh and chances are you could shed some tears as well, but it's all worth it in the long run.  This a movie that should not be missed by anyone, especially if you have had a special animal friend in your life.

I am a sucker for movies that depict childhood through the eyes of the child after they have become an adult.  It is really about the powers of friendship and the rites of passage that mark our lives as we get older and move forward through life. Despite all the violence that permeates the movies, where the body count keeps going up, I was shaken when Willie strikes the dog during a baseball game.  We all do things that we are ashamed of and this scene struck me as very realistic.  In the end when Willie goes away to college and the dog is waiting at the bus stop for him, there is a permeating sadness that I occasionally feel when I think of things I loved that no longer exist.

The dog helps him make friends and grow up.That's the capsule of the plot.  This movie is much more than that.  The acting all around is excellent, but special credit must be given to Frankie Munoz (as the boy) and Moose, the dog from Frasier as...the dog.My Dog Skip does a wonderful job of showing all of the joys and agonies of changing from a child into a young adult.  It's hard not to recognize yourself in the episodes.While this movie is sentimental, it's not played for sentimentality.  That's much of why it works so well.

Written by Gail Gilchriest, based on the book by Willie Morris.  Running time 95 minutes. Rated PG (for brief violence and mild language). 	My Dog Skip is an emotionally effective and challengingly involving piece of cinema. The film, directed by Jay Russell, based on a writing by Willie Morris, works well because it proves two theories 1) The war affected not only the soldiers in battle, but also normal families in minor but critical methods, and 2) Childhood can be best remembered by our fond memories with the family's dog. These elements present the audience with an accurate and knowledgeable atmosphere with memorable characters and issues.	The movie is set in the summer of 1942. The story explores a family of three, Jack, Ellen, and Willie Morris. Jack (Kevin Bacon) is the heartbroken father who lost his leg in war years ago. Ellen (Diane Lane) is the simple minded housewife doing more manual labors than women usually complete. Willie (TV's Frankie Muniz) is their lonely son-maybe ten years of age. He has no local friends, is poor at sports and teased at school. His best acquaintance is in his mid twenties, a mechanic named Dink (Luke Wilson), who is called for battle not too long into the picture, leaving Willie all alone. Ellen decides to go against father's orders and purchase Willie a faithful companion of his own for his birthday a puppy. Although Jack firmly opposes this gift, his wife convinces him Willie is old enough to take care of a dog. Willie names his new friend Skip, who drinks out of the toilet, does not obey commands, and seemingly understands human emotions.	My Dog Skip wisely uses the war as a mood developing overtone; a background event that provokes confusion in Willie and gradually changes the lives of those around him. The time period is ideal for such a film to take place. The filmmakers produce a lifelike atmosphere that perfectly defines what living in the 1940's was like. 	The film features beautiful and captivating performances by everyone in the cast. Frankie Muniz, from Fox's Malcolm in the Middle on TV, is very effective and well cast. He creates the appropriate narrative connection the film depends upon. Kevin Bacon is broad yet poignant, with a bold mood of a father in the 40's. Luke Wilson is also successful here, making his dynamic character obvious throughout.  Diane Lane does not have enough screen time to explore any real material, but creates rich character chemistry with Bacon. The movie could investigate the Luke Wilson character more thoroughly. About half way into the story, My Dog Skip nearly drops this seemingly important character only to later bring him back to supply the plot with several crucial sequences. Skip's intelligence appears to altered in various scenes throughout the production. In one scene, the dog will presumably understand human emotion and restore motivation. In others he cannot accomplish simple tricks and drinks out of the family toilet. This animal, although very significant character, needs to be more consistent and less exaggerated.  Most of the film's dialogue is right on the money; smart and fitting. It is not too straightforward or excessively blunt, but gentle and thematic. Most of My Dog Skip is gentle-hearted, however, and provides the lovable atmosphere that starving audiences are searching for, along with high quality and entertaining situations, in family based movies. If this description fits you, regardless of age, this is the movie you are looking for.My Dog Skip is brought to you by Warner Bros.

Well, the whole thing is so beautifully handled that it's a truly moving piece of drama.Frankie Muniz really surprised me in his role. He went through, something which I would describe as what Adam Sandler went through for Punch-Drunk Love, an absolute revelation. His portrayal of Willie Morris is convincing, accurate, funny, moving, all those words and more. His performance here beats his other film work anyday, and is even better than what he did in his TV show Malcolm in the Middle. His co-stars Diane Lane, Luke Wilson and Kevin Bacon (big names, huh?) are reliably good but it's really Frankie who steals the show here.My Dog Skip is an underrated, moving masterpiece which 100% shows the importance of having a friend.

There are 9 damns and a few other profanities, but nothing earth-shaking.It's simply the memoirs of Willie Morris, a southern boy who wound up as a famous writer and editor of Harper's Magazine. Being that magazine is pretty Liberal, you get Liberal slants in the movie (racial and anti-war sentiments) but nothing heavy-handed.As a good story does, it makes you care about the characters, especially the lead one. In here it's Willie and his dog Skip. Early shots of Skip growing up - measured in how he related to the toilet bowl - are funny. You also care about his parents and are glad when the dad (Kevin Bacon) softens his stance on things. As a guy, I appreciated just looking at Diane Lane. What a gorgeous face!The cinematography is pure southern charm and looks great on DVD. It's not all sweetness. There are some angry moments and some sad ones, to be sure.

The first time I saw it was in the spring of 2000, a little less than a year after I had gotten my dog. Seeing that movie as an eight-year-old really moved me and developed an extreme appreciation for the friend that I had and still have in Copper, that little, spunky tail-wagger. By the end of the movie, I was in tears. Now, having seen the movie again for the first time in ten years, my reaction was the same. Yes, there are a handful of movies that can succeed in bringing tears to my eyes. Schindler's List and Vertigo are two of them. My Dog Skip is another.This picture could be considered the Old Yeller of contemporary times. It's sweet, it's simplistic, its sentimental, and its honest. The true story of Willie Morris, who grew up in the 1940s as a painfully shy boy whose best friend was the local baseball hero who lived next door. When his friend was drafted into World War II, Willie was alone in the world until his mother went against his father's wishes and bought him a terrier for his birthday. That moment was the turning point in Willie Morris's life.The movie My Dog Skip is a beautiful dramatization of an entirely involving story. I don't know if the touch about the moonshiners has any factual basis (or for that matter, if anybody in the audience can identify with that) but every element about the boy and his dog is absolutely heart-breaking. Now I am a sucker for movies like this, but I don't think you have to be a sentimental as me to get involved here. As Richard Roeper so eloquently put it on Ebert & Roeper, only a heartless curmudgeon - the type of person who would kick a puppy could not be moved by this. The movie tackles all the important elements of the relationship between a boy and his dog loyalty, responsibility, love, etc. But it also crosses over into subjects that are seldom explored. Darker moments like what happens when the boy has a few other friends but happy go-lucky Skip really wants to play fetch? It also touches realistically upon (and I can back this up from personal experience) the pains of being alone and tormented by others and how having just one friend - just one friend - can change everything.What I also adored about the movie was the way the supporting roles were handled. Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane are not only in fine form as the boy's parents, but they are given very naturalistic and humanlike characters to play. The father's initial reluctance to allowing his boy to take on the responsibility of pet - and having some of his fears come true - was a great touch, but the movie does not make the foolish mistake of over-blowing it to the point where we'd dislike the father. We see his concerns and his wise outlook on the world, and watch him as he sort of softens up along the way. And his mother is completely open to any solution that can help their kid along. These are two people who deeply love each other and deeply love their child and want to see the best for him.Maybe the subplot with the obligatory puppy-kicking curmudgeons (this time moonshiners working in a cemetery) has some factual basis (I've never read Willie Morris's autobiography, so I can't be sure) but it was the least interesting and most mechanical element in the movie and it seemed, until a crucial point, to sort of stop the picture. However, since it is so minor and so dismissible until a certain point, it does not really interfere in the enjoyment of the movie. And again, I must be honest that by the end of the picture (now an adult) I was balling like a little boy. And, still an adult, as soon as it was done, I got out of bed, walked over into the next room where Copper was sleeping and hugged him passionately. The poor dog. He was probably wondering why he had been woken up at one in the morning after several hours of peaceful slumber, but it was sort of necessary at the time.That's what makes movies like My Dog Skip so great. It's not one of those pictures that essentially gets down on its knees and begs you to like it and to be moved. You really have no choice but to be moved. Not unless you never owned a dog or a pet of any kind. Seeing the movie again for the first time in ten years reassured my respect for my own dog and thankfulness that having him as a loyal friend changed the course of my life.

It's quite possibly one of the saddest (yet most beautiful) dog movies I've seen.It's based on a true story, set in the Yazoo, Missouri, 1942, about a 9-year-old kid named Willie Morris (Frankie Muniz), an only child without friends. His mom Ellen (Diane Lane) gives him an adorable terrier (Enzo the Dog) for a birthday present whom Willie immediately befriends and names Skipper, but his dad Jack (Kevin Bacon) - a Spanish Civil War veteran, objects to the idea of him owning a dog, saying that dogs are just a heartbreak waiting to happen. Skip guides Willie through childhood, helping him make friends and grow up, becoming popular in the town and always standing by Willie's side and loving him no matter what.Normally, I'm not a big fan of family movies (though I can make exceptions and still have some favorites from childhood), but it's such a wonderfulfilm.

I dare anyone who's had dear friends that are pets to watch this show and not have some wet in their eyes.Writer Willie Morris was but a boy during World War II and a lonely only child. In an effort to get him to get out of his shell,his parents--the dad(Kevin Bacon)much more reluctantly than the mom(Diane Lane)--decide to get him a dog. The dog,Skip,a well-tempered terrier(Jack Russell?)and Willie bond much better than anyone could've imagined,and the boy learns life lessons and discovers that he had more courage and integrity than he once imagined. As per any story involving friendships that start from youth,Willie grows up,Skip grows old and the sad,inevitable follow-through of the story is a poignant and even haunting.Portrayed by the honest,if perhaps limited in range,actor Frankie Muniz(who may always be Malcolm of Malcolm in the Middle),Willie is neither cute nor snotty,and very much common. He's good at making his pains and struggles fel as real to the viewer as if you were enduring(perhaps even re-enduring them)yourselves as viewers. Lane and Bacon make warm,unsentimental yet true parents,and a supporting cast that includes Caitlin Wachs(As one of Willie's schoolmates)and Luke Wilson(As a local WAr Hero who may not be what he was made out to be),this film has an unforced warmth and humanity that most who have any interest in lesson movies will value greatly. Director Jay Russell(not to be confused with Austin Powers director Jay Roach)is given good material and a good cast to work with,so his job is fairly cut-and-dried walk the viewer along on a nostalgic,sometimes humorous,sometimes sad journey down memory lane. I must confess that I've only seen this film twice,but the memory is so strong that I'm not sure if I can even talk about it,let alone watch it,without feeling the waterworks come up. Still,knowing that those are honest feelings from a literate and humble story,there's nothing wrong with wanting to tune in to this somewhat recent offering in the long pantheon of Boy and his dog stories.

It also provides a finely textured portrait of its wartime, small town Mississippi setting. Based upon the memoirs of writer Willie Morris, `My Dog Skip' stars the wonderful child actor Frankie Muniz (the delightful star of TV's `Malcolm in the Middle') as a friendless nine-year-old misfit whose mother buys him a puppy for his birthday to help assuage his loneliness.  More fond of reading than of football, young Willie becomes the hapless target of the town bullies and Skip provides him with just the right note of friendship to help him through his trying times.  The cast of characters also includes Willie's well meaning but overprotective war hero father (sensitively played by Kevin Bacon), his loving and supportive mother (the fine actress Diane Lane), the boy-next-door town hero (Luke Wilson) who turns out to be less than one on the battlefield, and a band of moon shiners who figure into the climactic activities of the film's final half.`My Dog Skip' is less noteworthy for its plotting &#150; which often seems forced, obvious and melodramatic &#150; than for its overall tone of laid back charm.  Muniz in particular brings such an aura of subtle naturalism to his role as Willie that we easily overlook the film's overall lack of originality.  Actually, the fact that Willie seems like such a likeable regular kind of a kid undercuts the film's credibility a little.  We find it hard to believe that he would really be such an outcast from his peers.  The writer, Gail Gilchriest, and director, Jay Russell, manage to keep the sentimentality down to a minimum, though the film does get a bit goopy once in a while.  The moonshining subplot seems especially weak and unconvincing, a pale but underdeveloped echo of `Huck Finn,' a book Morris obviously worshipped as a child (we see him receiving a hardbound copy of it for his birthday).  On the positive side, the filmmakers resist the temptation to gussy up the narrative with either highbrow humanitarian messages (though the narration does become a bit portentous at times) or insulting lowbrow comic slapstick.  The issue of race relations is dealt with in somewhat glossy and unrealistic terms, but that is probably the appropriate choice for a film aimed at such a young audience.  `My Dog Skip' needs to be viewed on two levels &#150; as a beautifully acted but unsurprising version of a tale adults have seen countless times before &#150; and as a sweet, heartwarming and edifying film for young children who will be able to identify with many of the simple themes found in the narrative.  On that level alone, `My Dog Skip' scores high as ideal family viewing.

Then he meets his first real pal, his wonderful dog Skip, who gives him the confidence to make friends, play sports, and grow up.Anyone who has ever loved a pet will love this movie. Just the title is enough to tell you it's going to be sweet and sentimental and it is, but not overly so. Talented Frankie Muniz (Malcolm in the Middle) plays Willie with so much innocence and spirit that you believe everything he does. Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane play his parents and of course, there is Skip, the irresistible Jack Russell terrier who will surely melt your heart.Subplots including WWII, segregation, and moonshiners are all seen through a child's eyes and there is the same sense of wonder that made To Kill a Mockingbird such a remarkable movie. This is, of course, a tear-jerker but it's a good cry. Highly recommended for the whole family.

But I did. And cried my eyes out. The part that got to me was when Skip was watching the but leave and then at home trying to get onto Willie's bed. All I could think of was that Skip didn't know where Willie went or why. He didn't understand what had happened. All he knew was that his pal was gone.One thing that I didn't like was the subplot about Dink. I would have liked it if Willie's dad overheard their conversation and understood that Dink wasn't a coward and helped him to overcome it with the rest of the town. After Skip recovers in the hospital, all of the rest of Willie's friends, including Dink, just disappeared. It was as if they never existed in the story or Willie's life. If the script had done a little to resolve Dink's situation, I would have given the movie a 9.Then again, I saw this on broadcast television, so that part may have been edited out for time.

He acquires a dog which turns his life around. It is a very kind-hearted entertaining movie. It raised some questions for me which make me want to read the original material, true story on which it was based. The boy's father is a veteran of the Spanish Civil War which would make him a leftie or a Commmie-would he really have been welcomed back in small southern town? The movie cleverly reverses the usual by making the mother the one who is pushing the boy toward boyhood while the father wants to protect him. He is given a girlfriend; is this modern cliché for real? It seems the gang of young thugs are just trying to help him become a boy I'm skeptical about that too. In one scene the two children are shown riding their Schwinn bicycles on the sidewalk under the benevolent eyes of adults. Riding a bicycle on the sidewalk is an 21st century habit still against the law. I don't believe it would have been tolerated in the film's era.

Also after watching this movie, I feel you cannot escape asking yourself `What is my favourite pet?' I have had two favourite pets, one was my father's boarder collie-cross kelpie sheep dog, called &#145;Lassie', who was a fantastic dog, both as a worker for my father, and a family pet for my Sister and I when we were growing up. I have never forgotten the night she died. But these days, my family's oldest cat, a pure tortoiseshell cat, would have to rank as my favourite pet. This is a highly entertaining family movie, with a great humour, sentiment and emotion.  Who says best friends have to be human? Not Willie Morris, who receives a talented terrier named Skip for his birthday. With Skip's remarkable and unconventional help, Willie and Skip turn bullies into friends, tangle with hapless moonshiners, and even win the affections of the prettiest girl in school. Shining with warmth and humour, &#145;My Dog Skip' unleashes a story that will have the entire family sitting up begging for more.Director, Jay Russell, did a fine job with this movie. I loved all the shots with the dogs that play &#145;Skip', as these were done with great class and emotion by Russell. He also re-created the time for the movie beautifully, and handled all of the young performers in the movie very well, because they stood out to me every time they were onscreen, none more so, then Frankie Muniz. Also, having the movie only run for little under an hour and a half, was the perfect length, which I am sure Jay has to take the credit for.   The story for &#145;MDS' was based on the true story, written by Willie Morris, a very intelligent story indeed. The screenplay for the film was adapted by Gail Gilchriest, who I am sure, would have had Willie's input many times. Gilchriest added in a large amount of story for both Skip and Willie and showed Willie's life to be very unpleasant many times. But the great parts about this script are its &#145;emotional and very human side', which I know I will not forget for along time to come Willie Morris (played by a very young Frankie Muniz) was perfectly casted in his role. Before seeing this film, I have found Muniz to be an unusual kind of actor, mainly because of his role in the weird and dysfunctional TV-comedy &#145;Malcolm in the Middle'. But after seeing him in this film, he convinced me how talented he really was. I also think that Muniz needs to be commended for how well he acted with the two dogs in the film, as this was vital to final make-up of the film. Willie's parents, Jack (Kevin Bacon) and Ellen (Unfathful's Diane Lane) were perfect choices as the conservative parents. I especially like how Ellen tries to makes Willie's life as good as it can be, considering the barrage of abusive he receives. Jack is a very wise man, and tells his wife that letting a dog come into their son's life could be harmful, because he will become attached to the animal and love it. He is afraid Willie could be hurt via the animal. Willie has a great relationship with his next door neighbour, the famous Baseballer Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson). Wilson is convincing as Dink, especially when he returns from serving in the 2nd World War. He is a very dark type of character, after that event.The town characters are also interesting to see on the screen. Willie's enemies/friends are entertaining to watch see go from one stage to another, thanks to the help of Skip. Willie also gets the girl of any boy's dreams, that of Rivers Applewhite (Caitlin Wachs). The townfolk love the cute little dog of the Morris's, especially the local butcher, Barney (Bill Butler). However there is one person that we do not see, but only hear his voice in the film. The narrator (Harry Connick Jnr.) is the very deep voice of a much older and wiser Willie Morris. I really like Connick's part in the film, as it is not unlike that of Alec Baldwin's voiceover performance in &#145;The Royal Tenenbaums'.Much of the credit for the film, has to go the two dogs trained in the film. Skip (Enzo and Moose), were extremely well trained in the film, by animal trainer Maltilda de Cagny. I loved every scene with Skip in it, as it would bring a smile almost every time. But the best scene has to be when Skip is causing a stir through Mississippi, with Willie and Ellen. I could not stop laughing. My only disappointment after seeing this film for a second time is that I wish I had had a dog just like &#145;Skip'. My reasoning is because I had an indifferent time as child, being picked on like Willie was in the film. I really could have used a friend like &#145;Skip'. When I compare this movie to other movie and TV experiences I have had, I think of an old TV show called &#145;The littlest Ho-Bo', which featured a big German shepherd, who wandered from town to town helping many people on his journey. It was very similar to &#145;My Dog Skip', as it had great emotion, and was one of my favourite TV shows as a child. This film and &#145;October Sky', while handling completely different stories and age groups for that matter, are similar qualities of movies. However, &#145;My Dog Skip' is just a little better from where I viewed it. If you have not seen this movie, then I can only recommend you do. But I warn you, have the tissues handy, as there will not be a dry eye in the house.CMRS gives &#145;My Dog Skip' 5 (Brilliant Film)  "},{"Title":"Great Movie - But not the book","Date":"18 October 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Sport","Review":"  Another reviewer stated that the movie was loosely based on the book.

There is an old poem or story about how perhaps the greatest gift God ever gave mankind, was the friendship of canines.  This movie proves out that adage.  The cinematography is outstanding - it lovingly caresses semi-rural Mississippi at mid-century; and this film so beautifully recreates America during the War years (the beginning of the baby-boom generation) that I encourage grandparents like me to take their grandkids, just so they get a very accurate picture of our OWN childhoods.

A perfect example of this would be the Pokemon movie- a movie with cardboard characters and storylines that is clearly only interested in raking in the bucks. However, once in a while a film comes along like A Christmas Story, The Sandlot, or My Dog Skip that puts the others to shame. There is more heart, soul, joy and truth in a single scene of Skip than in a hundred Pokemon movies. It is a sad irony, therefore, that Pokemon was a blockbuster while this movie will make very little money. In a perfect world it would be just the opposite.         The film stars Frankie Muniz (who as recently found fame as the star of Malcolm in the Middle) as Willie, a kid growing up in the South during the early '40's. He has few friends, and so his mother buys him a cute, clever dog who helps make his life alot easier and better. The characters who surround Willie are that rarity in a family movie real, three-dimensional people. At first we expect the kids who bully Willie at school to be just bad guys, but they turn out to more than that. When Willie's dad (uncharacteristically played by Kevin Bacon) tries to take the dog away at the beginning of the film, we the audience automatically assume that he's simply a stern, mean father, but then he explains in a touching scene that he did it because he wanted to spare his son the pain of losing the dog someday. No one is allowed to be a caricature or a cliche- everyone has emotional depth, so rather than becoming bored with the characters, we are intrigued by them and want to see more.          Rarely has a film affected me so. There were scenes so powerful and so reminiscent of my own childhood that I found myself blinking back tears at times. This movie captures the joy and pain of childhood as well as any I've ever seen. I wanted the feeling it created in me to last the rest of my life.

Exciting, entertaining, and loving story of the grace that animals give us","Date":"4 March 2000","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Sport","Review":"  Chicago film critic Roger Ebert wrote recently that he didn't want to hear about any critic's opinions regarding this movie, if the critic did not have a dog themselves while growing up. I can see why he said that-- the amazing grace of love, loyalty, and even evolution that only animal lovers can know is amply and magnificently portrayed in My Dog Skip.To answer Roger Ebert on another point-- he said that it seems unlikely that a 9 or 10 year old boy would volunteer to have his dog shipped off to the army, and thus off to war (the movie takes place during world war two). Bless his heart-- his love of life and his fond memories of his own dependence on his own dog (etc.) probably prompted him to make that calculation. After all, these are the safe and comfy modern times of middle age. But as I watched the movie, I totally bought that behavior-- thinking that such a devoted boy during those times would have taken his beloved dog friend down to enlist in the war for the same reason millions of boys all over the world happily trotted themselves down to the various countries' recruiting stations-- he had no idea of what it really meant. It was romantic, patriotic, and heroic, in a simplified, child-like way. But he had no conception of what it really meant, nor of pain of the ensuing separation, death, etc. So as it was, I say sure-- a boy could have volunteered his own dog to be a Yankee Doodle Doggie.But wait! The movie is also really good in addition to that. I had dogs growing up, and cats now (they have seen me through graduate school), and I can relate to the pets as friends vibe. I'm also a sucker for kids' movies, too, especially ones involving animals (in my view, for example, the movie Milo & Otis, and the PBS television series Wishbone are a genuine masterpieces that should appeal to anyone of any age). This comes from years of toting children to every type of kid movie since the 1970s. So perhaps I am predisposed to liking My Dog Skip, with or without other merits.I submit to you, however, that it has many merits. It is multi-merited. I give it an enthusiastic 10.

The film was dedicated to him. It seems therefore that he did not live to see it, despite it being based on the book he wrote about his childhood memories with his dog Skip. Morris (1934-1999) came from Jackson, Mississippi, and wrote two books of childhood memoirs, MY DOG SKIP and GOOD OLD BOY A DELTA BOYHOOD. The 'Delta' referred to is the Mississippi Delta, a region made internationally famous by the classic novel by Eudora Welty, DELTA WEDDING, which is one of the greatest works of fiction ever to come out of the American Deep South. The film itself is transposed to Yazoo, Mississippi, for some reason, and some characters are changed or invented. The main theme of this story is of a lonely boy whose best friend becomes his dog. But it is interwoven with many simultaneous adult and childhood events and tragedies, so that a rich texture of life in the town is evoked and portrayed. It is very true to the pattern of small Southern towns as they used to be, with a boy's dog becoming a well-known member of the community who could be greeted heartily on the street as he trotted along. In this film, perfectly accurately, we see townspeople greeting Skip as he passes them, or saying 'There goes Willie's dog Skip,' as if they were speaking of a person. There is one hilarious scene where Willie and his mother put Skip at the wheel of their car and the mother drives the car down Main Street while lying out of sight on the seat, so that everyone gasps with astonishment at the sight of seeing a terrier drive a car. Skip keeps his eyes on the road and the wheel and does not look to right nor left. Such things were common occurrences in such towns back in those days, and right up until the 1960s. After that, the small towns all over America were gutted by shopping malls, spreading suburban blight, and above all by the interstate highway system. All the small communities were destroyed overnight, and so stories like this one are now of archaeological interest. I grew up in a small Southern town and my dog, who was my best friend, was known by most of the people in the town and greeted in the street as if she were a person, exactly as shown in this film. Furthermore, my adult friend Sarah V. Thacker used to drive up and down Main Street with her pet pig sitting up on the front seat beside her. All of these things are absolutely what happened back then, but are as inconceivable now as if 1000 years had passed rather than just 50 years. Being a child when there was no meaningful TV, no internet, no cell phones, in an isolated small town full of colourful characters, and where you could wander round at any time of day or night with your dog, where no one ever locked his house or his car and not a single burglary or theft had occurred in more than 100 years, was in many ways delightful. All the nostalgia for such small town life is justified. I say that for the younger people who have never experienced it and cannot possibly imagine it. It was also a time before drugs, and before the mass commercialization of sex. In fact, it was quite literally a time of innocence. There were no murders, no rapes, no muggings, no burglaries, no car thefts, no school shootings, no drug addicts, and no one ever worried about a little child wandering around the town at any hour because nothing could possibly happen to him other than maybe tripping in the dark and hurting his knee. This vanished world, set in the 1940s and hence before my own time, is miraculously recreated in this film. The casting is superb. The little boy Frankie Muniz plays Willie Morris with perfect charm, and is just right. Luke Wilson is excellent as the student sports hero Dink Jenkins who lives next door. (My student sports hero was named Kermit Lance (who alas died young), who treated me with the same gentle and friendly consideration shown here by Dink.) Kevin Bacon is excellent as the tormented father who has lost his leg in battle, and Diane Lane is just as good as his mother. Caitlin Wachs is perfect as 'the prettiest little girl in town' who becomes sweet on Willie. The other kids are excellent. There are some excellent performances by the minor characters who, being black, are relegated to the background of the story because they lived in a different part of town in those days of racial segregation. One is the young actor Nathaniel Lee Jr. Another whose name I don't know played the man who worked in the grocery store and gave slices of 'baloney' to Skip. The black inhabitants of the small Southern towns were important figures in its composition in those days, but were as confined to their social circles in their private lives as many of the immigrant Hispanics and Muslims are today. The segregation was not entirely forced, for there is always a tendency for any minority to prefer a ghettoized social life, as we see today more than ever. At one point in the film we see a film being screened and catch a glimpse of the black children being confined to the balcony while the white children sit in the stalls below. In another scene we see the black people filing up the fire escape stairs at the side of the cinema to enter the balcony. These segregation details are not highlighted in the film at all, but are there for the sake of social accuracy. How well I remember the ridiculous four rest rooms in every bus station!

Although Hollywood has hyperbolized this autobiographical account of late author Willie Morris' youth in Yazoo City in the summer of 1942 and the canine who changed his life, My Dog Skip measures up as an endearing, tail-wagging, Alpo epic aimed more at nostalgia-minded adults than adolescents. This pretentious but picturesque parable about a pooch (albeit one with more pedigree than most) and his famous young master strives for the poignancy of To Kill A Mockingbird but lacks the complexity of the Harper Lee classic. Mockingbird explored racism, while Skip only nods at it. Nevertheless, sophomore director Jay Russell has freshman scribe Gail Gilchriest have spun a superficial but entertaining saga about a boy and his dog that quenches your emotions without insulting your intelligence.Life for nine-year old Willie Morris (Frankie Muniz of TV's Malcolm in the Middle) is no picnic. Not only is Willie small for his age, but he also doesn't fit in with everybody else. Being different at his age poses huge problems. Willie prefers reading rather than romping around with a football, so the school bullies regularly prey on him. They corner him after class, knock his books out of his arms, rip up a letter,and call him names. Willie's next door neighbor, Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson of Home Fries),the most celebrated jock in Yazoo City, becomes his friend. The bullies cannot understand why Dink pays Willie any attention. When Dink enlists in the U.S. Army for duty overseas in Europe, Willie is saddened because he is losing his only friend. Although his father loves him, Jake Morris (Kevin Bacon of Sleepers) is so embittered by the loss of a leg in the Spanish Civil War that he doesn't give Willie much room to frolic. Ironically, Jack tries to shield Willie from the pain of life as he struggles to deal with his own loss. Meanwhile, Willie's resourceful mom, Ellen (Diane Lane of Untraceable), awakens the Tom Sawyer in her son. She gives Willie a puppy for his ninth birthday. Jack hates the idea. Dogs are just a heartbreak waiting to happen, he insists. Willie's heart will break, he fears, if anything tragic happens to the animal. Despite Jack's objections, Ellen puts her foot down. Willie gets to keep the puppy! Skip becomes Willie's best friend. Willie's circle of friends widens. Eventually, the school bullies accept him, especially after Willie spends a stormy night in a spooky graveyard without turning chickening out. This is where Skip and Willie run afoul of two scummy bootleggers. Skip acts as matchmaker, too. He arranges Willie's first date with sweet little Rivers Applewhite(Caitlin Wachs of Thirteen Days). They go to a movie and share popcorn with Skip. As Willie's confidence swells, he takes Skip for granted. At a baseball field, where Willie is playing finally instead of watching, Skip delays the game. An enraged Willie clobbers him, and Skip skedaddles. Later, pair of villainous bootleggers traps Skip, beat him with a shovel, and leave him for dead.My Dog Skip unfolds as a fairly ordinary sequence of vignettes which feature either Willie undergoing his rites of passage or the mischievous Skip in an adventure of his own. For example, when Jack and Skip are collecting blackberries, they cross paths with a couple of hunters. Willie watches as a deer dies from a rifle shot. He touches the blood with his fingers and examines the blood as the animal takes its dying gasps of air. Russell and Gilchriest have taken a formulaic plot and embroidered it with several ironic lessons about life. Luke Wilson's ill-fated jock, Dink Jenkins, serves as a contrivance to show that not all cowards are alike, especially when they hail from championship stock.Frankie Muniz refuses to be upstaged by the six adorable Jack Russell terriers alternating in the lead role. Two of them, Moose and Enzo, appear on NBC-TV's Frasier. Luke (Blue Streak) Wilson rounds out a sympathetic cast as Willie's next door neighbor who fights the Nazis and experiences the horrors of combat and the shame of cowardice. Ken Bacon brings surprising depth and compassion to what essentially constitutes a cameo as Willie's wounded father. Jack Morris displays a dour Hemingway quality. Although he won a medal for losing his leg in the war, Jack assures Willie,I'd rather have the leg. Only kids that have not been weaned on Ritalin, PlayStation, and MTV will appreciate this tear-jerking tale about a terrier with its refreshingly authentic depiction of rural Mississippi. My Dog Skip shuns the slobbering slapstick of Beethoven for the heartfelt sincerity of Old Yeller. Above all, despite his scene-stealing antics, Skip balks at performing far-fetched feats of the Rin-Tin-Tin variety! Willie Morris saw My Dog Skip three days before he died of a heart attack at age 64 and gave the movie his blessing.

Two reasons. First, I am a sucker for anything known as cinema, and two, there was quite a bit of popularity surrounding this film at the time of its release. I remember hearing that Kevin Bacon could possibly win an award for his outstanding performance in this film and that it was one of those films that will make any person with a heart break into tears. So, I submerged myself into this film one fateful night and watched a cliché Hollywood story with some very decent acting attempt to pull at my heartstrings and moments of nostalgia. I must admit, some of the rumors were correct. Bacon, as well as others did some phenomenal acting in this little film, but it was the story that ultimately disappointed me. I needed creativity, spontaneity, and excitement, alas, all I found was a simpleton story that could easily be found in any book dealing with dogs, pre-teens, summers, and social climbing while suffering from the classic Old Yeller syndrome.My Dog Skip doesn't hold back in using every classic Hollywood trick in the book when building the relationship between Willie and his dog, Skip. From the dog becoming a part of the community to eventually saving lives while teaching lessons, My Dog Skip does not promote originality at all. You could see the director talking to his crew about how other Hollywood hits like Turner & Hooch, Benji, or any of the Lassie series (either television or film) did it, and how he would not like to stray far from those devises. Would it have harmed director Jay Russell to be original, to take a stronger stance on developing the author Morris' words a bit stronger. This could have been a sensational film about friendship during the troubled years of America (i.e. the War and apparent racism in Mississippi), but instead Russell skirted around the issues and penetrated our hearts with a cute Muniz and a dog that was prepped for the camera. I apologize about my cynicism towards this feature, but I witnessed a lack of respect for both the patrons in the audience and the time it was attempting to portray. Even though this was developed as a children's film, I believe that more should have been explained about the circumstances surrounding Dink, more should have been developed about the bootleggers, and more needed to be developed about the scattered racism in town. Russell attempted to paint this beautiful image of rural Mississippi in 1942, but it felt that instead of using paint he used candy to gloss over some of the rougher edges. There is a point when we must realize that children can accept the facts of our nation, and that a boyhood friendship can still grow strong even during times that we are not proud of.What is friendship? According to My Dog Skip, friendship is helping an insecure someone reach a better point in their life. Friendship means always being the initiator, while ultimately realizing that this same person may never repay the favor. Do you not agree? These were the life lessons that I learned from this film. This is another hearty mistake that I believe hurt Jay Russell's feature. Here we have Muniz unable to cope with the social struggles of life without the help outgoing and energetic Skip. If it weren't for this dog, Willie Morris may never had broken free of those insecure shackles of life. Yet, somehow, no praise is generated for this dog at the end. Without giving anything away, the final note of this film is rather depressing, not due to the events that occur, but due to the actions of Morris. I nearly shed a tear because I felt horrible that this dog was so exhaustingly great to this boy, yet Skip is slowly forgotten.While I may not have great ideas to share about the plot of this film, I did think that the acting was a par above your typical dog befriends boy films. Muniz does his job well considering being hired mainly for the cute element. He kept my eyes on the film, but it was Kevin Bacon's role that kept me glued to the screen. Kevin Bacon continues to prove that no matter what part you give him, he will stand up and ensure that he gives his undivided attention to the character. He will take you away from seeing Kevin Bacon on screen, and force you to see the depths of his character. I believe an entire film could have been centered on Bacon's portrayal and possibly been better than what we witnessed here. Diane Lane again demonstrates her ability to play the every woman role. She needed to be handed more in this film to broaden her character. Not enough meat was given to her to chomp on, which hurts one of the pivotal scenes early in the film. Luke Wilson, well, he plays Luke Wilson. If you have seen any of his films, than you have seen his portrayal in this feature. He needed to reach deeper into the Born on the 4th of July moments to truly capture his character. Then, I cannot end without giving credit to Clint Howard. Clint Howard is an undiscovered gem in Hollywood. While his brother hogs the spotlight, Clint can honestly stand on his two feet in my book. It was his portrayal of Millard in My Dog Skip that strengthened this mediocre film.Overall, I didn't like this film. There was no creativity or originality of the story (which in my eyes was too candy-coated even for the youngest of viewers). This was one of those films where I believe the acting was directly in line for what it needed, but alas, the story was nowhere to be found.Grade ** out of ***** "}{"Title":"My Dog Skipped","Date":"24 April 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Family, Sport","Review":" My Dog Skip (2000) Dir Jay Russell / Cast Frankie Muniz, Kevin Bacon, Luke Wilson, Diane Lane, Clint Howard Family film about how a pet can teach children values in life.

Dink goes off to war right before his ninth birthday. His father Jack (Kevin Bacon) is home with a war injury. His mother Ellen (Diane Lane) gets him a Jack Russell terrier but his father refuses to let him keep it. He wants to shelter him from the inevitable lost but she won't let it stand. Little girl Rivers Applewhite likes Will and his dog Skip. He befriends a colored boy who tells him that he's never heard of Dink but Waldo Grace is the best ballplayer. Dink sends him a German helmet and ammo belt. Will brings them in for show-and-tell and he is terribly picked on. The bullies dare him to spend the night in the cemetery to join the group. He and Skip battle moonshiners, stays all night and ends up joining the gang. Dink returns from the war haunted. Will is doing horribly at a baseball game and hits Skip. Skip runs away and gets into trouble with the moonshiners.This is generally a touching kid with dog movie. There are some rough patches and trying to fit in too much. The story probably could use a lot of trimming. It's based on Willie Morris' autobiographical book and meanders like real life. Some of it plays falsely like the rough looking moonshiners. The narration is unnecessary and a more simple narrative would be a vast improvement.Frankie Muniz is a good child actor. The bully is trying too hard to be a bully especially if he's suppose to become friendlier later on. The role needs a less stereotypical bully and a more compelling actor. Diane Lane is lovely. Kevin Bacon is not quite that commanding father figure. Luke Wilson doesn't really fit the star ballplayer type. Also I would have liked Dink play Waldo Grace in a game. I thought the movie was hinting in that direction but the race card seems to be played half-heartedly.

No. Just a movie about a boy and his dog and how it's complex grow up, but can be fun, at the same time. My Dog Skip (2000) is one of that movies where you know will find emotional scenes or happiness moments, but even so you watch. Is it a predictable movie, maybe? Yeah, but this does not detract the shine of a story about a shy boy and his discovery of life. Willie Morris, or Will for his parents (because he don't have any friend of his age) it's a shy and alone boy, living on the calm town of Yazoo on the dark years of WWII. As he describe at the beginning Ten Townsend souls and nothing to do. Is this a nice place to live and grow? Not for Willie. Without friends, his life is empty and he's constantly annoyed by other boys. His parents try to understand the son, especially his father, described by Willie as a soldier of Spanish Civil War, where lost part of his leg&#x85; and sometimes, I believe he's lost the heart too. His mom is sweet and understandable, trying to help her boy. Well, his life changes when he won a dog on his birthday. Called Skip, the animal will be the way of Willie understands himself and how to confront the world. Skip helps the boy to make friends, talk with his love girl and finally, be mature... grow up. This is the soul of My Dog Skip. The director Jay Russell tries, at the first shoot, connect the story with his public. To be more specific connect the characters with the public. When the dog appears, this important thing (connection) becomes more important. What does that means? It means that we'll care about the characters, their conflicts, problems&#x85; their lives. It's how if we could see ourselves on silver screen. To create a story, beyond the boy discover himself, Jay Russell adds a stolen of beers. The thieves are hiding drinks on the cemetery. But this part of the screenplay it's not so important than we discover how Will confront the life, the social problems (racism and racial segregation &#x96; we don't have to forget that the story takes place at 1940's) and moral conflicts (his best friend disinherits the Army and come back dishonored). All this things are seen by the point of view of a boy. It's a good movie, even if we know how will be the final, we see. Just because the director tried to connect the characters, the conflicts with the public. It's very grateful see this worry, a thing that, unfortunately, was forgotten by the directors and screen writers. My Dog Skip it's an old movie (have 15 years old), but must be revisited many times, just for understand how its important connect the story with public. Emotional, funny, sometimes sad, and the point of view of a boy about the growing&#x85; and how a dog can change the life forever. This is the soul of My Dog Skip!

When I was younger, I had the same issue that Willie had I was in love with dogs, but my parents wouldn't allow me to have one. So, that being said, I sincerely wanted to enjoy the rest of this story, but it felt VERY difficult to do. The plot isn't any well written; as a matter of fact, Willie is a cute kid and all, but there isn't anything interesting going on to catch spectator's attention on the story. Willie and those young bullies do a lot of boring things, and I doubt that even kids can enjoy the young characters portrayed in this film. Also, I don't think that actors involved in this project tried to do their best, considering that performances are just average-- or less--, so it makes me wonder why My Dog Skip has such a good rating on IMDb. If I were you, I would just skip this flick and watch Hachi A Dog's Tale again.

This is one of the last doggie with some appeal and quality. In other words, traditional. Different from what movies of this kind (and cinema in general) have become in the most recent years.The dog of this movie is a Jack Russell Terrier. A very correct selection, as it is one of my favorite dog breeds. Milo from 'The Mask' introduced me to this dog breed and since then I like these dogs very much. Jack Russell Terriers are small dogs yet so energetic. They're so jaunty, jolly, playful, hilarious and stubborn that you can't possibly not feeling amused around them. And they're also very intelligent dogs.The story is sentimental/touching and the movie has appealing settings. There are some harsh moments as well, and some comedy. The ending is one of the most emotional in doggie films the part when Skip is nearly dying but survives and Willie is crying and shows remorse on what he did in a moment of anger and the ending itself when years later the dog dies old and ill.This movie is based on a real story and was released in 1999 or 2000, but when was it filmed? It must have been filmed a few years sooner? The kid who portrays Willie Morris (Frankie Muniz) looks unusually childish for a teenager. He looks like a child and even his voice is extremely childlike. Is it possible that he looked like that in 1999 or 2000? And he's only 1 year younger than me! Anyway, the boy does a fine portrayal in the movie.Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane do a good job as Willie's parents, without forgetting that Diane Lane looks gorgeous in this.

I think that it deserves four stars and that Hollywood should make more movies of this sort.  It shows that dogs as well as people, can be sensitive and display emotions very deeply.  As a dog lover myself, I can certainly identify with this movie and what it is displaying, 100%.  It certainly is a good family movie and moved me deeply at the end.  Both dog and boy were hard pressed to part when it came time for them to say good-bye.  It was very cute to see the dog at the bus station saying good-bye in his own way along with the parents.  It reminds me of how sad my own dog looks at times when I leave home and have to part company.  The two dog stars were very smart and displayed a very high level of intelligence.  I can only say that Mr Morris was very fortunate to have had a mother so sensitive to his needs. I keep this movie at the front of my video collection.  I never want to have to spend a long time having to look for its whereabouts and always want to have it at my disposal. I can only say that I do encourage Hollywood to make more of these movies in the near future.  These movies are a source of good family entertainment.

So we need to let you know that what we are about to depict-more or less-actually happened.'`My Dog Skip' begins with such a phrase, and soon you see why.  The movie, based on writer Willie Morris' memories of growing up during World War II in Mississippi, portrays a smart little boy who has no friends (except the athlete who lives next story who's about to ship out to Europe).  Worse, he is taunted daily by three boys.  And his father-who lost a leg in the Spanish Civil War-takes his bitterness out on the boy by being overbearing. Then the mother-over the father's protestations-gets the boy a dog, and his whole life changes.  With Skip at his side Willie suddenly wins over the boys who pick on him, gets his father to warm up-and so on.  No doubt this all happened, but the `based on a true story' frame admits that the audience might be winking and saying, `Sure it did.  This must have been some dog!Anyway, this is a fine family film.  The acting by Frankie Munoz (of `Malcolm in the Middle'), Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon (two of the most underrated actors in the industry) and Luke Wilson is good.

Frankie Muniz (Malcolm from Malcolm in the Middle) stars with Skip in this sweet and emotionally charged story of  growing up. Muniz plays a younger character than on his show and hits the mark. Kevin Bacon is exceptional as a good father made somewhat hard from the horrors of war, and Diane Lane turns in a tremendously better performance than her one in `The Perfect Storm.'

All the characters are well portrayed, especially Willie's parents, played by Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.  The story line of the next door neighbor, who is Willie's hero, going away to war only to return in disgrace, doesn't quite work but manages to fill out the empty spots in the film.

I lost it when  I got home. For those of you who have not seen the movie, don't get me wrong, it's not depressing, just hit very close to home for me.

Loveable little thugs.I have read some comments from reviewers that the dog, Skip(Enzo) was too unbelievable to be a true story. Well, apparently those reviewers never owned a Jack Russell(or perhaps any dog they were close to). They are very remarkable dogs...very intelligent, very outgoing, and very, very independent. I miss my little girl terribly and not a day goes by that I don't think of her.I hope that in seeing this movie, people do not rush out to get a Jack Russell puppy for themselves or their youngster without researching the breed. A Jack is a demanding dog, requiring much supervision, training, attention and exercise. If you do get a Jack, you will have a friend for life(a long life often, they can live 15-20 years).If you want to see a wonderful movie which will evoke warm emotions and fond memories, go see this film.Love you Maddie, miss you very much.

Basically, set in 1942, in Yazoo City, Mississippi, Willie Morris (Frankie Muniz) was a lonely boy and the only child of sometimes harsh and stuck up father Jack (Kevin Bacon) and charming and chatty mother Ellen (Diane Lane) with only a few friends, including neighbour and local sports hero Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson) who goes to war. On Willie's birthday, against the wishes of his father, he is given a new puppy as a gift so he can have good company growing up, he names the dog Skip, and the become firm friends very quickly, playing with each other all the time. Willie does want to make some friends in and out of school though, and he does have some of the boys including Big Boy Wilkinson (Bradley Coryell), Henjie Henick (Daylan Honeycutt) and Spit McGee (Cody Linley), but they do eventually leave him alone and even allow him to become part of the gang doing something scary, which he does. The Narrator (Harry Connick Jr.), i.e. a grown up Willie explains that Skip helped him get through the best and worst parts of his childhood, helping him to make three friends and meet girlfriend Rivers Applewhite (Caitlin Wachs), but they do have a falling out when the boy's first ball game comes along. Willie is upset with a returned Dink not coming see the game and it going wrong that when Skip is there to try and cheer him up the boy hits him in frustration, and after the game he is unable to find his dog. Skip is in the graveyard where bootleggers Junior Smalls (Peter Crombie) and Millard (Clint Howard) are hiding moonshine alcohol in a crypt, the dog is hit with a spade by one of them just when Dink and Willie find him in the graveyard, the moonshiners are arrested, but the dog is hurt. Time passes as Skip is lying in the veterinary hospital and everyone is unsure as to whether he will survive, Willie sobs that he will never have a friend like his dog again if he dies, but Skip awakens and happily licks his friend's face and hands. The film ends with Older Willie (Michael Berkshire) leaving home to attend Oxford University in the United Kingdom, the narration explains that without Skip he would have no real childhood, and it is explained that Skip stayed and was cared for by the parents, sleeping in Willie's room, until he tragically died and was buried under the elm tree. Also starring Mark Beech as Army Buddy, Susan Carol Davis as Mrs. Jenkins and David Pickens as Mr. Jenkins. Muniz, who became Malcolm in the Middle the same year, is appealing as the little boy, Bacon and Lane are good as the sometimes concerned but supportive parents, and Enzo the dog is the sweetest character that steals all scenes he appears in. The story, based on a real one, is simple and easy to follow with all the right moral messages and family feel, I will admit it is corny at times, but that is part of the charm, it is a likable biographical drama that everyone can relax with.

Bacon soon succumbs to Lane's instance, and Skip stays in the picture...Skip (short for Skipper) teaches Muniz to play football as well as read books. He overcomes shyness to go hand-holding with the prettiest girl in elementary school, Caitlin Wachs (as Rivers Applewhite). After much frolicking, we see some inevitable drama&#x85; so, if sad movies always make you cry, be prepared to shed a tear here and there&#x85; maybe even a bucket&#x85; The sentimental My Dog Skip begins to falter when the subplot involving moonshiners takes center stage; they clearly built this episode up to steer the drama, but it is excessively contrived and manipulative. Otherwise, this is an excellent, kid-friendly tearjerker.There are two particularly outstanding elements. First, the setting is recreated beautifully. Art and set direction are the film's most obvious strengths - with stellar work from David Bomba, Tracey Doyle and the crew. Notice how well director Jay Russell and photographer James L. Carter keep the setting aligned to the story being based on Willie Morris' youthful memories. Therefore, we get idealized recollections, with racism barely visible and the horror of wartime combat unfolding slowly in both Morris' mind and Bacon's sure-footed performance. Finally, the narration, whether or not verbatim, sounds like Willie Morris' prose.******** My Dog Skip (1/8/00) Jay Russell ~ Frankie Muniz, Kevin Bacon, Diane Lane, Luke Wilson "},{"Title":"Heart Warming only second of an animal film to Homeward Bound","Date":"20 February 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Sport","Review":" I'm going back a good few years now as to when my mother first bought My dog skip on VHS. What i can remember is, is that this along with homeward bound is an animal classic, but in a much different fashion. My dog skip truly shows the relationship a boy can have with his dog which i know of all to well as i have a jack Russel terrier myself who i have been with for the past 6 years.My Dog skip shows how a young boy (Muniz) can grow up needing a friend. The film shows how growing up can initially be hard and at times lonely, even for anyone. Like Homeward bound, Skip attempts to portray the fantastic relationship between man and dog. The films only downfall at times is that it shows the speedy progression in quality of life for the protagonist and how he develops a contrasting relationship with some of his friends in comparison with how they were before.I don't plan to talk all day however in summary My dog skip is a great watch, with admittedly some very tear jerking moments. I recommend this film to all dog lovers and people who liked such films as Homeward Bound My dog skip - 8/10.

Skip, the story about a boy and his dog, was hauntingly narrated by Harry Connick, Jr. Between Connick's emotional reading and the sparse dialogue contained in each scene, a picture was painted that did not require a viewing in order to truly move its audience to actually feel what was happening on that screen.The story takes place during a simpler time (the South in the early 40's) but presents conflicts among family and among neighbors due, in large measure, to the smoldering anger and fear that a raging world war can summon. It also deals with universal truths as to right and wrong, as well as the characters' clear, but simplistic belief systems and the respect folks had about how a family should be raised. This device made the movie both poignant and, perhaps 'unrelate-able' to today's younger audience.Connick brings a lilt to the words he speaks in narrating this film, not unlike his delivery of a song. He deserves much of the credit for the beauty of the film. The cast was excellent, but knew best when to just step aside and let the relationship between a boy (Frankie Munez) and his dog do the talking.Bravo!

Frankie Muniz gives an award-caliber performance as Willie Morris, a mostly true story set in Yazoo, Mississippi, about the friendship between Willie and his dog Skip. The story starts in 1942 when Willie is 10, his mother giving him a pup against dad's wishes, and most of the film concerns his adventures and misadventures near that age. It ends by jumping to 1953 with him boarding a bus to go off on scholarship to a university in England. Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon are fine as his parents. There is a side story about a local athlete hero who goes off to war and returns in shame because he ran. And another thread concerning the friendly but cautious relationships between the whites and the blacks in this small southern town.  It presents things in a positive manner, but as an illustration shows white kids and black kids in two different lines to buy movie tickets, and while the movie was showing, the white kids are in the lowed level while the black kids are in the balcony. Having myself grown up in a small southern town in the 1950s, this and the whole film rings true of how things were at that time.And that is why I enjoyed this film so much, and rate it a strong 8 of 10. It is simply an extremely well-done film about a boy growing up with a strong bond with his dog, something many of us did when we were that age. All the situations they get into are interesting, some very comic, some tragic, and all are well-done.  Graveyard, moonshining, baseball game, bullies at school, first girlfriend, young men going off to war, forming of friendships, those sorts of things. A rare film these days.I saw it on DVD. Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is really good, and appropriate, and the picture and colors are among the best I've seen.  The extras are limited, basically a selectable commentary track which is modestly interesting, and a few deleted scenes which also are modestly interesting.

The acting was so poor, by not just Muniz, but all the children in the film, that it completely pulls you out of it. However, I feel that this is not entirely the fault of the actors, but also the poor director. Parts with large groups of people, say in crowds, seem incredibly staged, and cheering in a crowd takes no acting ability, thus the fault is in the director. If this wasn't enough, the character development is just as bad. By the end of the film, the only character we really know anything about are Willie (Frankie Muniz) and his dad (Kevin Bacon). Even Dink (Luke Wilson) who is an important character to the story and is Willie's hero, we know next to nothing about. This film has such a good story to it, that it's a shame the acting is so bad.

Too bad the movie hadn't featured them in more detail instead of a too cute dog whose chief talent seems to be that he can roll over on his back and get the cute girl in class to come over and scratch his belly. The rest of the movie is as unoriginal, including the biggest kid in class who is the town bully and Skip picking up a football in his mouth in order to help the main character impress, guess who, the cute girl in class.All of those scenes might have been decent if handled by a director who didn't go for the schmaltz, but this one lays it on pretty thick including emotional music that is so over the top it makes you want to turn off the VCR...which I did.

My first impression was formed by the syrupy background music that played almost continuously throughout the film. If it had lyrics, they would be, Open up some Kleenex and just cry, cry, cry. I cried, all right, but for the wrong reasons. Any film that involves the use of animals inevitably includes harming said animals, and My Dog Skip was no exception. From the graphic hunting death of a deer to the verbal/physical abuse of the dog, this project could not have been pleasant for the title character, who out-acted all his human counterparts. Keep in mind the fact that movies are only fictional where people are concerned. Animals only experience it as real-life mistreatment that they cannot comprehend.The plot can be summarized in two words Who cares? It's a coming-of-age tale about a boy named Willie and his terrier Skip in small-town 1940s Mississippi. Willie has growing pains. He has to contend with a stern father, the town bullies, his complete inability to play baseball, an inexplicable, mostly one-sided friendship with a WWII veteran who is painted as the town pariah, and a first love named Rivers, to whom we never find out what happens. Most of the characters are completely forgettable, and the narrative consists of loosely-pasted vignettes of a dreary childhood. I only saw this movie last night, and I don't remember much of anything except being surprised to learn that, in the c. 1945 South, white families could watch young black men playing baseball after dark. (Read Maya Angelou if you don't understand what I'm saying here.) A violent scene leaves the viewer feeling lousy, after which the story just peters out. We see Willie rowing his girlfriend on a pond--probably an allusion to his Rhodes scholarship, which requires athletic ability--and then he suddenly grows up and blows town, leaving the aging Skip all by himself. If the film's hypocritical concluding drivel doesn't make you want to throw up, then nothing ever can. Comparatively speaking, Old Yeller was more cherished than ol' Skip.I don't recommend this film to animal lovers of any age, particularly children, because they won't understand its conclusion. I'm not even sure that I do, if for no other reason than to wonder how in the hell a dimwit like Willie ever made it into Oxford.

In the scene near the end when skip gets hit with a metal shovel by one of the mean men in the film and it looks like he may die (a trick used by director's to get the tears flowing) you just know he is going to live & there are many of the other usual elements that this type of film has. I would say it was really just a TV Movie made as a big screen film.maybe 5/10 "},{"Title":"Melodrama about nothing","Date":"17 August 2000","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Sport","Review":"  I found it hard to figure out who the audience was for this movie.  It was way too slow moving and boring for kids, and to much of a pretentious rehash for adults.  This movie was an edge free compilation of the growing up in America stories we all had to read in junior high.  The long monologues by the narrator of how having a dog is the key to understanding what it means to be human were just too much for me.  The movie mentions the war, mentions racism, mentions bullies, but doesn't give any new insights into experiencing this period in our history.  In short the movie was boring and empty.  I'm glad a man that was picked on as a kid grew up to be successful, but it isn't enough for a movie.

When it mercifully ended, I asked my wife, What was this movie trying to say? She replied, I have absolutely no idea! The race problem in the Southern US in the 40's lurked around the edges, but did not really affect the story, which is nominally a coming of age reminiscence. It does have a couple things going for it a cute dog, a cloying kid, period props, and a 1940's era Flxible intercity bus, which probably would not have transported servicemen from the prominent railroad town of Yazoo City in 1942. This film feels phoney from the get-go; the emotions are contrived, and the plot line concerning the dog's injury and recovery is utterly predictable. Ultimately, I felt it was a total waste of 95 minutes (and seven million dollars). It sucks.

And this film is almost the definitive illustration of this principle.It pulls out nearly all the stops in sentimental nostalgic Americana without any new insights.  It makes the old 70s Lassie tv series seem like profound masterpieces by comparison.  And with apologies to Harry Connick Jr (who I really like as a singer and in his other film roles), his narration in this is preposterously contrived and pretentious.  A very routine by-the-numbers textbook boy-and-his-dog sob story.  Bleechh!!!

I thought it was sentimental hokum.The retro view of 40s Mississipi just looked so staged.The situations were almost all ridiculous and it simply lacked any real emotional honesty. I had hoped that this film might be similar in feel to Hallstroms My Life as a Dog a truly original and wondrous coming of age film. Maybe I am becoming cynical as I age or maybe this movie was too Hollywood for me.So apologies to all of this movies fans ....it just didn't do it for me. As a genre there are a number of coming of age films out there to choose from.Whilst I am sure the director set out to portray an honest view of childhood there are too many other films that achieve a better and more credible vision.

I cannot recommend this movie for any child that has a dog, - and if they have a Jack Russell terrier, do not let them come close to this movie.  Children and adults were crying all over the theater.  My grandchild was still crying all the way home in the car.

I thought the movie Fluke was alright and I loved Old Yeller, so it's not that I'm against animal movies as a rule; but the combination of six things meant that I could not enjoy this movie. a) The script was the worst I've ever endured. Does every line have to be cliché? I threw up five times. b) The acting job ranged from mediocre at best to laughable at worst. c) The many subplots were boring and never went anywhere in addition to having little to no meaning. d) The characters were annoying and unsympathetic (aside from the dog). e) The soundtrack was terrible and extremely repetitive, not to mention unoriginal. f) Overall this movie stole from all other animal movies in every way, shape, and form.The only thing about this movie that made me sad was that I wasted my time watching it, and that my stomach hurt from throwing up too much. Also, it would have been more entertaining if something actually happened. Movies that only have morals like Everyone needs a friend or dogs are cool!!! are bad, as a general rule.In conclusion only watch this movie if a) the only other choice is some other kind of torture, and even then, be careful, b) because you LOVE DOGS SO MUCH and you cry at all dog movies because you own a dog and it might die or you did have a dog and it died, etc., or c) because you are in need of a laugh and don't mind the side effect of throwing up. But in most cases, just don't waste your time and save your eyes, ears, and stomach. "}]
