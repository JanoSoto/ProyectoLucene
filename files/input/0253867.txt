Or are there enough superficial shallow bimbos in their very late twenties whose brains are made of cotton candy walking this earth to actually have caused someone to think this movie could make money?Christina Applegate and Cameron Diaz in this film are not sexy, not funny, they're simply annoying beyond comprehension. They were what I would imagine their real life counterparts would be like, more so Cameron Diaz. I'm sure she didn't tap into her acting talent one bit to perform this role. She just showed up on set and somehow memorized her lines.I can imagine the executive in Hollywood who approved this script is some old, horny, fat, repulsive swine with a huge cigar in his mouth and whiskey on his desk. Wheezing with laughter as he read the script while his fat lips watered at the thought of either of the two leads getting naked. I'm sure he was incredibly disappointed to find neither of them actually got naked in the film, which in a desperate sort of way, would have been the only thing that could have even remotely made this film worth watching.I can't remember very many details from this film, probably my subconscious protecting me from mental trauma, but I do remember feeling all the more stupid for having watched this.Christina Appelgate's character meets Thomas Jane's character in a nightclub which instantly annoyed me. Who the hell goes to a nightclub to meet the man of their dreams? She becomes fond of him, in the only way a superficial tramp can become fond of someone, and decides to chase him down via a road trip to stop his imminent wedding and profess her crush/lust whatever to him. Thomas Jane is cool though, he starred in a movie called Thursday, which is a great sleeper of a film. However having him in the film was like putting a band-aid on a gunshot wound, that just wasn't enough to fix it.You won't enjoy this unless you're a stupid, self centered, shallow, ditsy yet sarcastic and fairly heartless bimbo. Even then if you watch this movie and like it there is absolutely no hope for you, you know who you are.You've been warned.

Spicey and racey - the 3 girls are excellent dead panning while dropping sexual innuendo and cursing like truckers.I am having a tough time comparing it because it is like a bunch of films rolled into one.  The one major difference is that the major players are women.  Think Animal House, Road Trip, American Pie, Swingers, History of the World Part I, Something about Mary, AND even Monty Python!  The penis song is a classic.  And the fact that its done full scale muscial like (think Grease) yet the topic is about the size of a man's member - you've never seen anything like this before!  You'll be telling your buds about the Dry Cleaner scene.

And that's not such a bad deal, in my book.	Christina (Cameron Diaz), Courtney (Christina Applegate) and Jane (Selma Blair) are close friends, single and young, who have for some time been living the high life in San Francisco, each of whom seems committed to avoiding commitment in any relationship (except for Jane, who's been with the same guy for nearly a year now).  Christina's motto is, Don't look for `Mr. Right,' look for `Mr. Right Now!'  After all, girls just wanna have fun.  But the men in their lives do not necessarily want to play the same game, which Jane finds out the hard way when her boyfriend dumps her suddenly.  And though they don't realize it at first, Jane's situation is about to become the catalyst for all of them to do some reevaluating as to where all the fun, freedom and frolicking is taking them in their lives.  They're all closing in on thirty (Christina is twenty-eight, the others about the same), and somehow, the `love &#145;em and leave &#145;em' thing doesn't seem to be all that fun anymore.  And wouldn't you know it, Christina has just met a guy named Peter (Thomas Jane) at a nightclub, but doesn't realize how much she is attracted to him until after she lets him slip away.  And the next day she just can't quit thinking about him.  Suddenly, the shoe is on the other foot, and Christina discovers that it's just not such a good fit...	Bolstered by the engaging performances of his leading ladies, as well as a terrific supporting cast, Kumble has crafted and delivered a comedy that provides plenty of laughs and a good time for all.  Written by Nancy M. Pimental (a staff writer for TV's `South Park'), it's romantic without being sappy, and raunchier than what you usually get when the story is presented from the female perspective.  Even so, it barely skirts Farrelly Brothers territory, comparatively, except for one scene-- involving a `piercing'-- that may be a bit too much for some tastes; but even that scene is carefully structured and presented in such a way that the filmmakers were clearly going for just plain funny, rather than anything gross or offensive.  And-- subjectively, at any rate-- they succeeded.  The story reflects a certain moral ambiguity consistent with today's society (similar in that regard to such TV shows as `Friends'), but this film is not meant to be taken too seriously or pondered too deeply; it's a film that was made to make you laugh.  And it does.	Cameron Diaz is a wonderful actor who can do drama with the best of them (As Julie in `Vanilla Sky,' or Carol in `Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her,' for example), but she definitely has a natural affinity for comedy (Kim, in `My Best Friend's Wedding,'-- in which she steals the show from Julia Roberts-- or Mary, in `There's Something About Mary').  She's a gifted, charismatic beauty with a grounded, down-to-earth sense of who she is and what she can do, and apparently has no problem with putting ego and vanity aside in deference to the demands of her craft.  And it's an attitude that's enabled her to create a lasting impression and some truly memorable characters in film after film, as she does here with her Christina (which is one of the main reasons this film is so palatable).  She has an alluring screen presence that serves her well (as it does her films), and she just keeps getting better and better with every project.	Another reason this film works so well is because of Christina Applegate, who gives a winning performance as Courtney.  Pairing her with Diaz was inspired casting; they play beautifully off of one another, and it makes their scenes together a delight to watch.  Some of the things they do is just flat out funny-- like their `Movie Montage,' which is absolutely hilarious.  Like Diaz, Applegate has a natural charm that comes through well on the big screen, and this film, hopefully, should prove to be the catalyst that will finally take her career in that direction and enable her to at last shed her `Kelly Bundy' persona, once and for all.	As Jane, Selma Blair also makes a good impression, even though-- due to the storyline-- she is somewhat overshadowed by her co-stars.  Her part may be smaller, but she has her moments, and manages to hold her own during her scenes with Diaz and Applegate.	Turning in notable performances, as well, are Thomas Jane, as the guy who may or may not be `the one' in Christina's life; indie queen Parker Posey, who brings her trademark quirkiness to the role of Judy, the beautiful bride; and Jason Bateman, who's become an outstanding character actor (he's come a long way since `Silver Spoons'), as Roger, Peter's brother.	Rounding out the supporting cast are Damon Williams (Wedding Guest), Georgia Engel (Vera), Johnathon Schaech (Leather Coat Guy), Eddie McClintock (Michael), Don Winston (Eric), Manny Rodriguez (Paramedic) and Andrea Sabesin (Sheila).  A right-on comedy that is going to appeal to a wide audience, not only because of the performances, but because it's clever, agreeable and accessible, `The Sweetest Thing' is exactly what it is supposed to be  Funny.  Still, be forewarned-- there are a couple of scenes that will be hard for those with certain sensibilities to embrace, and accordingly, it has an `R' rating.  But if you can go with the flow, and think Chaucer, Rabelais and Balzac, this is one you're going to enjoy.  It's the magic of the movies.  8/10.

I don't understand the scathing vitriol heaped at this movie from US critics -- how is it more offensive or insulting than 'American Pie' or 'Animal House'?  Is it because in this movie the women are the ones being bawdy and crass and not in their usual roles as naive school girls, there to be played by the male leads?  It's not a coincidence that the majority of critics who panned this movie are crotchety old men.I laughed out loud constantly, the dialogue was pretty good -- there were lots of quote-worthy scenes and the best part was that the girls seemed to have such a good time.  I had fun watching them goofing around.  The interaction between the female characters and the depth of their friendship was entirely realistic.  Women DO sit around being crass, they DO (sometimes) use men for sex and leave them to eat dirt and have fun all the while.What endeared me forever was the scene where Christinia Applegate is dressed up as Vivian the hooker from 'Pretty Woman' -- her send up of Julia Robert's horsey overlaugh (TM fametracker.com) was SPOT. ON.  (America's Sweetheart? Gag me with a fork).  The scene where Cameron Diaz kisses the male lead was great because the producers allowed her to get her lipstick all messed up.

While it's not as good as TSAM, it's quite funny and reasonably sweet. The main problem with the film is one of momentum.  It will be skating along on an amusing riff or a sweet moment and then stumble and find itself splayed out on the sidewalk, looking confused.  One doesn't feel deeply about the movie's rather sketchily drawn characters, weakening the dramatic moments, and the comedy, while more hit than miss, does miss more than one would like.

It's repetitive sightgags and jokes have been played in every bad comedy ever made.  There's a very simplistic, almost non-existant plot that takes backseat to the gags and most of the jokes are played until they die.  So why was I laughing throughout the whole thing?  Easy answer The actors.  Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair look like they are having so much fun - it almost makes me want to be in the film dancing along side them.  This film worked because of its brilliant comedic actors.  They were thrown lemons and made lemonade.I've always liked Cameron Diaz.  She can transform from a sexy high-kicking detective (Charlie's Angels) to an ugly pet-loving freak (Being John Malkovich) to a scary, psycho (Vanilla Sky).  She is one of the most versatile actors today and I like her no matter how bad the movie she is in is.Christina Applegate reminds me of Jennifer Aniston in this film, she has expert comedic timing and she's just plain funny! Selma Blair, the least known of these three portrays such an innocence that we feel so bad for her when she's in these incredibly impossible situations.  Selma Blair usually plays the best friend or the other woman...it's about time she got her own starring role.And last but not least, I have to mention Parker Posey, who has a small role in this film.  Parker Posey steals every scene and every film she has ever been in.  She is just one of the most brilliant actresses today.So, The Sweetest Thing has been saved by four wonderful actors having a ball.  It's fun to see once - and then put away for good.

CauleyThe Sweetest Thing truly is just that.  If you want to see a comedy that will make you laugh hysterically for an hour and a half, this is it.  I went into this movie not expecting much but The Sweetest Thing was an unexpected treat.  There were a lot of laugh-out-loud moments.  In fact, guys everywhere who are going to get drugged to this movie by their significant others will find themselves pleasantly surprised.Cameron Diaz stars as Christina Walters, a successful San Franciscan player who decides it's time to be serious about love with Peter Donahue, played by Thomas Jane.  Her best friend is Courtney Rockliffe, played sweetly by Christina Applegate.  It's about time Applegate was given a starring vehicle in a good film.  Best known as Kelly Bundy in TV's Married...With Children, Applegate is so hysterical in The Sweetest Thing it will leave you thinking Kelly Who?Another former television star, Jason Bateman, is given a nice role as Peter's brother, Roger.  Best remembered as David Hogan from The Hogan Family (aka Valerie's Family), Bateman, who is the brother of Family Ties' Justine Bateman, is excellent as the quirky sidekick.  This foursome unfortunately don't get to spend a lot of screen time together but their individual scenes are very funny.  Last, but not least, is Selma Blair who plays Christina's roommate, Jane Burns.  Jane has man trouble herself, having just been dumped by her boyfriend.The three girls go out on the town looking for fun but Christina accidentally finds the man of her dreams.  Christina and Courtney soon head out on a road trip (Jane has to work) to hunt him down.  The slapstick adventure that ensues is quite comical.  Not to be left out, Jane has some madcap experiences of her own, back home.  The scene that awaits Christina and Courtney when they return is the height of hilarity.  Diaz and Applegate make a great pair of friends.  They even took a break from the plot to perform an impromptu  movie montage that kept the audience in stitches.At times, The Sweetest Thing could give some teen movies a run for their money in gross-out humor.  It even out does the hair gel scene from There's Something About Mary.  It also has it's fair share of clever humor too, via Nancy Pimental's screenplay.  Like last year's Legally Blonde, this film doesn't take itself seriously.  The female stars are cute, the male stars are cuddly and all are good at what they do.The commercials say If you like 'There's Something About Mary' and 'My Best Friend's Wedding,' go see this movie but I say The Sweetest Thing is better than both of them put together.   No Oscars will given to The Sweetest Thing this time next year but like the apple pie in America Pie, it has moments that will stay with you forever.  It's a fun date movie that will have you rolling in the isles..go see it!

It's actually not that far off from The Wedding Crashers except, like I mentioned, it's definitely the ladies' point of view! It's nice to see more of the women's side of things; not unlike SATC, with similar spirit to Sex... as well.I like that every San Fran stereotype (and real-type) is represented in the film, and the city herself is pretty nicely shown off (which I love - my fave city). Like Sex..., the city is an oblique character in The Sweetest Thing. It definitely speaks to everyone's ease with being sexual and bawdy and campy at the drop of a hat (helpful words towards deciding if it'll be your cup-of-tea). Basically, if that stick's still up you're u-no-what from u-no-when, this one's not for you!BTW, I highly recommend the Unrated version over the theatrical; nothing worse than having a character say or do something where the two-second money shot or the actual swear-word, etc. they're working up to is cut out at the last moment - HATE that. This way, if they're talking about penis, they're going to SAY penis (and a few other descriptives).Definitely, if you've been to San Francisco and loved your time there, you'll get a kick out of The Sweetest Thing. Just be up for a flick that doesn't waste more than 30 seconds taking itself seriously, and you'll especially enjoy the extra musical number thrown in, known lovingly as The Penis Song!

Also, I thought that the way they met was very romantic. I especially loved her pals, Courtney (Christina Applegate - MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) and Jane (Selma Blair - LEGALLY BLONDE, CRUEL INTENTIONS).

So what was the bottom-line 'Never stop looking for Mr. Right'? 'It's better to have loved and lost'? Surely not, she meet her Mr. Right in a club, she didn't love him and he was never hers to loose in the first place. She was 'hurt' because he never told her he was getting married. No because he only meet her the day before, did she want his life story? Perhaps he thought he'd never see her again. You meet alot of people in clubs that you never see again, right.Humor. Humor? Oh the sex jokes? That's right, sex jokes and it's the girls having a go at them. It's ok for a girl to make sex jokes, same for boys, but these sex jokes were the bad the worse and the ugly. They weren't funny, just childish and degrading to females. Don't get me wrong, I did get some laughs out of it, but it wasn't clever humor, it was more like pity humor. But hey, I'm not saying everything considered comedy has to have you in stitches, it's just not the kind of thing I laugh at.The characters. Apart from Jason Bateman, I didn't like any of the characters. Diaz and Applegate try to be funny and outrageous but they just come off as being irritating. Selma Blair's character is the one I disliked the most, even though she wasn't in it as much as some of the others. She seemed very fickle about what she wanted her character to be like. And I found it amazing how quickly she got over her boyfriend of a year. In the last 10 minutes of the film Diaz and Blair had a quick personality change. What's that about? Suddenly they're best friends. Where's Diaz? Out getting the man of her dreams so she can join their little entourage. Like the beginning when Diaz and Applegate were both single party girls, and Blair was the outcast with a (now ex) boyfriend who had to sleep with a complete stranger to fit in. But that was about a month before, people change. I'm sick of movies that make men out to be cheating liars and women out to be desperate tarts.Now, Bateman and Thomas, I really liked the chemistry they had together. They made believable brothers. Bateman wasn't always in your face with his preaching and philosophies. He seemed like the only 'real' person there, whereas the others were all Hollywood-ish.It's more for gullible teenagers or the closure of a drinking-binge. If you like cheesy films filled with cheap laughs or watch them because they're so idiotic then it's worth a watch. Think 'Dude, Where's my car?' with Female-leads.

The film opens with a lame montage of guys that have crossed the path of `too good for any man' Christina (played by Cameron Diaz). Of course it immediately cuts to a shot of Cameron doing something cute and free spirited that shows just how all these men fall for her&#133; She's shaking her fine package up a street in San Francisco. Well they don't waste any time introducing the rest of the characters, for seconds later she runs into her best friend/roommate (played by Christina Applegate, playing this role as though it's make or break time for her career). Their 3rd and final roommate is played by Selma Blair whom you might remember from Roger Kumble's previous effort `Cruel Intentions'.  	The plot (or, you guessed it, lack there of) revolves around Cameron Diaz's character, a woman who never gives any man a chance to get to close, that is until one night at a club, her failed attempt to dump a stranger (Thomas Jane) on her younger horny roommate (Selma Blair) leads to a brief (and I mean brief!!) conversation with the man, a perfect set up for him to be charming and charismatic in ways only a scripted scene in a film as bad as this would allow you to believe. They part ways and later in the night bump into each other again&#133; This must be the man of her dreams right!! Anyway, the night ends without either continuing their progress in being together. Cameron spends the night dreaming this might have been the perfect man for her (the dream features the 2 in bed and the man pleasuring her at every whim. He even proclaims men don't enjoy oral sex&#133; funny right??). Her roommates realize that Cameron may be down about having lost him, so they bolt off to the brothers wedding in hope of seeing him again.	This whole brief and sudden road trip they take to go see this guy is unbelievable. Why are they going? Why such a rush since it isn't him that's getting married? Why do they stop for what seems like hours to try on clothes to wear to the wedding since they dirtied their other clothes in an unnecessary bathroom mishap?? Why do they show a shot of Christina Applegate imitating Julia Roberts in `Pretty Woman' 10 times?? Is any of this stuff supposed to be funny or entertaining? In my case I just simply felt embarrassed, for myself and for Cameron Diaz mostly. She's the only reason I am giving this film even ½ a star (and that's solely based on the fact she looks the best she ever has, but it ends there).	Aside from there being no point to this film, it is worth mentioning there is no reason what so ever to feel for this main character. She doesn't really deserve any sympathy, and her realization that she should perhaps be easier on guys isn't one we really care for her to come to. This is one of those stories about people that have it all and still complain, makes me want to roll my eyes just thinking about it. And how about the dialogue?... some of the worst ever written! What are they trying to do here, show women talking dirty and acting independent? I wish they could have really succeeded in doing that, perhaps would have made for an interesting film, but here it all feels a little forced and very fake. The banter between the 3 girls is never quite as shocking as the writer hoped it would be, and for all their efforts all we have is something to mock when describing the movie to friends.	That's about as much as I care to say about this movie. It got terribly annoying and worse as time passed, and still worse by the time it was over. What a god awful ending.

It is a collection of tacky, vulgar and anarchic ideas, many of which have been used so many times before in the last 50 years they are worn out. Their solution to this lack of originality was to imbue these scenes with as much verbal and physical sexual shock value as they could muster. It is as if they wrote it as they went along, a tenuous central storyline with a motley collection of disjointed, absurd and - too often - puerile scenes added in. It is not for adults, it is not really funny, it is schoolboy (girl?) humour for 12 year olds merely designed to show what you can get away with under the guise of being comic.

(I haven't seen her do an erotic flick yet)...until of course she botched off her entire outstanding track record and go do a very distasteful,and absolutely shallow movie called The Sweetest Thing.And it shows. Cameron Diaz has just accomplished making all women look like pleasure seeking not to mention superficial clueless AIRHEADS. As for Christina Applegate's character here,it is a throwback to her Kelly Bundy status from Married....With Children who hasn't learned yet,that she is still in ditzy blonde heaven and still shows it. One may demeaningly faunt one's body excessively half the movie if one is desperate unknown actress who badly needs to launch her career. One word Cameron, HONEY! YOU ALREADY THERE! WHY BLOW IT!What's worse than Cameron here was actor Thomas Jane(from Deep Blue Sea). He is totally horrible as the leading man. Jane who is known for for playing tough guys should stick to what he knows. Even actor Jason Bateman(from TV's Silver Spoons and also a child veteran of several TV shows and movies) who had such a tiny role as the supporting actor had MORE presence,personality and charm one of all of them.This film is the worst of Cameron Diaz' career.

The attempts at comedy don't work here since the timing is offensively off, the pay offs are meager at best and when it comes up with an amusing situation it tap dances off the deep end into the shark tank.For instance, there is one scene where Selma Blair's character is found by her girlfriends (Diaz and Applegate) along with an entire fleet of onlookers and police and firemen, to have a man's member stuck in her mouth due to a piercing.  Ok, it's old but still somewhat cute pun.  Then, in order for Blair to relax her vocal chordes the whole ensemble starts singing Aerosmith's I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing so that she can sing too.  I never thought I'd say this, but after that supposed gag I had to leave the theater and bang my skull against the wall not only to kill the memory cells that contained that scene, but the Aerosmith song as well.Even the most die-hard of Diaz fans will be scratching their heads at this one and guys who get dragged through this with their girlfriends (by some ugly twist of fate) should make them sit through Black Hawk Down and Fight Club back to back as compensation; Diaz in Charlie's Angels was more appealing in that.

That was a waste of time.'The Sweetest Thing' came out a year or so after 'Charlies Angels', which had reinvigorated the idea of actresses in ensemble casts, and was clearly trying to cash in on that fad. As cheesy and girly as 'Charlies Angels' is, it's actually not a bad film and has some genuinely funny moments. 'The Sweetest Thing'? Bloody terrible.There is genuinely no redeeming feature in this film. The story is boring and so blatantly predictable, the script was uninspired and without any laughs, the cast were wasted, and the fact that three sexy women could not engage me tells you everything you need to know.Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate disappointed me the most in the movie. She's a bit of a Marmite actor, but I've always liked Diaz; and Applegate is one of the best comic actors of recent times. But as best friends Christina and Courtney, the two women are rubbish. Christina is meant to be the 'modern woman', independent and self-serving; but instead of making that a character we warm to, Diaz makes her cold and whiny. Applegate is even worse &#x96; her portrayal of Courtney made me wonder why I should show any interest in her whatsoever. Selma Blair has barely any importance in the movie, so I don't even need to mention her.I didn't enjoy watching this movie, so I'm not enjoying writing this review. It won't go on much longer, don't worry. But I'll say this &#x96; when you have a cast full of genuinely funny actors (Diaz, Applegate, and an unbelievably awful Jason Bateman), the least you should expect is some humour.

There are some random mis-adventures along the way had by Ms.Diaz and Ms.Applegate, which, if you are a teenage girl could amuse you. Though with it being a 15 rating and some risqué dialogue, hardly makes that the target audience.This film constantly moves between serious chick flick, to slapstick carry on comedy. With ridiculous scenes of crowds of people bursting into song and dance how can we take this seriously. The whole film can be summed up in 10 minutes, but that would be too long. I am still finding myself waiting for it to end, not to see the blatant conclusion but to turn it off and never see it again.So if you want to watch a light hearted film, with no real story and some cheap gags, go for it.

We get together on some weekends and have dinner and usually go to the movies or rent one. This weekend we tried a new Chinese restaurant for take-out and rented a movie. The food was substandard but edible. One of the only movies none of us had seen was the Sweetest Thing. We were actually going after a picture that wouldn't take too much brain power. Something mindless and whimsical.  We hadn't heard anything good or bad about this particular movie so we thought why not? We said, `It has Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate in it, how bad could it be?' (forthcoming) `What the hay, let's give it a try.'  We had no idea what we were about to embark upon.  About the funniest thing in this tripe was when Christina Applegate shows Cameron Diaz how the skin under her arm swings when she waves. And that was more frightening than funny. There are about a million was to shred this movie but that, in the end, would be a waste of time in it's self. It would also waste more energy than this piece of tripe deserves. Lets just say that throughout the ordeal my friends and I moaned, cringed and asked over and over again, `why?' `How is a movie like this made?' `Who let this happen?' The talent in this movie is not award winning in the first place but is still wasted on this. Even mediocre and meager talents are out of place here. When looking up the writer and director of this garbage I was not surprised to see a very short, unimpressive resume. There is one scene where Diaz and Applegate are singing the Pina Colada song by the side of the road that last far far too long. It was embarrassing to watch. And those of you that have seen My Best Friend's Wedding already know that Diaz should not be singing anywhere let alone on screen.

It's quite another to make a movie that looks and sounds like it was made by dumb kids. I have absolutely no problem with crudity, raunch, sex or tastelessness in movies.  But the taboos that were once enough to make an audience gasp in horror are now commonplace in movies (e.g. a girl taking a dump on camera, semen in people's hair).

A ridiculously forced scene in which she and Christina Applegate dance around in their underwear to Escape is the closest this movie gets to being entertaining.  The gifted (and often funny) Selma Blair flounders with a useless and one-note character, who repeatedly gets into sexual predicaments.There's a scene in which Diaz and Applegate find Blair with her mouth caught on her boyfriend's genital piercing and get her loose by having her (and the obligatory crowd of onlookers) sing an Aerosmith song.  This scene is so mind-numbingly moronic, it nearly made me physically sick.  Not because I was offended or grossed out.  Because it was so unbelievably DUMB.  NOT FUNNY.

Example When Selma Blair takes in her cum-stained dress to the dry cleaners,  it turns out she knows the clerk.

Either that, or it figures that the audience will temporarily forget certain jokes, and that its ok to retell them again and again.This movie also made me realize that there is fine line between what *is * funny and what is *supposed* to be funny.

I've read reviews claiming that the levels of rambunctious mania these chicks work themselves up into stray into unrealistic delirium, but trust me, I've spent enough time observing girls in their groups and I can tell you there's no exaggeration to be found here. It's somewhat of a chick flick, with a super sexual, raunchy edge that would make the Farrelly Brothers proud, and the three stars lunge right into the sheepishly naughty material like girls sprinting from the limo to the club with designs on anything that moves within. Cameron Diaz seems to never have a shortage of adorably bubbly energy, playing a klutzy Christina, who along with her besties Courtney (Christina Applegate) and Jane (Selma Blair) head for a night on the town to ease Jane's guy-related depression. While Jane ends up bedding sweet, dimwitted Todd (tough guy Johnny Messner, hilariously playing against type), Christina surprises herself by meeting a guy she deems perfect, Peter Donohue (Thomas Jane, that chiseled deity). Only one problem he leaves town to get married, prompting Christina to drag the other two rascals on a road trip to locate him and declare her love. Sound silly? It is, in leaps and bounds, but it's got that infectious feeling of fun thanks to the gals who don't let up with their riotous banter for a second, and carry the movie to comedic heights of hilarity. It's got a wonderfully perverse sense of humour too, throwing social taboos out the window in favour of shameless sex gags, facepalm inducing mischief and and that R- rated, unapologetic sensibility that all the best sex comedies have. It's also got wicked work from Parker Posey, Frank Grillo, James Mangold, Jonathan Schaech and Jason Bateman playing Donohue's brother in a performance so sleazy you'll be wiping his presence off your clothes after. It's light and airy when in needs to be, gets down and dirty in all the places that matter, and hums along at sexy pace set by the three leading ladies, all clearly having a blast.

However I found this movie mostly disappointing and don't agree with the comments that it's a female version of those classics. I think it fails because it tries too hard and makes the trying very obvious. All the way through, the characters (especially the Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate characters, Selma Blair not so much) are constantly trying to appear and act wacky. It's irritating as hell, and leads you to despise the characters rather than feel empathy for them. I assume this is not the actresses faults --- Ms Diaz obviously did her job well in There's Something about Mary, while Ms Applegate handled years on Married with Children --- so I'm guessing either the director or the writer didn't have much confidence in the material and felt it necessary to add a layer of (non-amusing) idiocy. To me it felt like one of the bad Adam Sandler comedies or the bad Rob Schneider comedies or the bad (ie all of them!) Pauly Shore comedies, which also devolve into irritating characters acting wacky because there's not enough decent comedic material there to sustain the movie. If you want a girl's comedy done right, I'd recommend you stick with Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, rather than persisting with this through some sort of misplaced female solidarity. The three or so genuinely funny scenes don't justify the rest of the movie. It wasn't AWFUL, as a comedy, but it just wasn't as great as people are claiming.

She and her friend Courtney (Christina Applegate) are party girls who want to steer Jane (Selma Blair) away from the futile search for open and honest love. While partying with Jane at a bar, Christina meets Peter (Thomas Jane) who could turn out to be the love of her life.It's a age old question. Can hot girls be funny? They can definitely play dumb. Selma Blair has a couple of setups for her to shine. The funniest has to be the dry cleaner. The BJ scene isn't as funny as it could be. They could never show the actual BJ in a movie. So it only could ever be half funny. Selma has the funniest two scenes.The fact is Diaz and Applegate are smart, great actors with good comedic skills. But that's not their best assets. They're hot. The brains come second. The hot-girl default punchline to most jokes is the classic girlie squeal. It's never been a funny punchline to me.The girls aside, Thomas Jane is a blank in this movie. He's not funny, and he has no heat with Diaz. If this was a regular rom-com, he would need more screen time, and it would need somebody other than Thomas Jane.This is still relatively early on for the gross out humor era. Both Diaz and Applegate have done better in other comedies. They're too much alike. They don't make for a compelling comedy duo.

I wasn't expecting anything more than a few laughs and 'The Sweetest Thing' made me laugh out loud. To get a few things straight, the script is a mess as there are plenty of loopholes and character development is quite poor. That said, I liked the gender switch idea. I've noticed that this itself has outraged some people, most of them happen to be men, but to me it was a clever touch and Nancy Pimental's way of writing it is hilarious. And, how can one not laugh when the protagonists are played by three stunning actresses who are highly gifted in comedy? Not only do Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair really do look like close friends, they burn down the house. The humour is over the top, crude at times and most of the times plain silly but these three offered non-stop laughter. Hey, if Monty Python, David Cross and Jack Black can sing songs about women's sex organs, why can't these three women sing about men's sex organ? Thomas Jane and Jason Bateman contribute very well to the comedy. 'The Sweetest Thing' is no classic but obviously it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. As silly as it is, as a comedy I found it refreshing and entertaining.

Well let me stop you there because I'm a guy who does like romantic comedies like Love Actually, arguably the best rom-com ever, Date Night (with Tina Fey and Steve Carrel only recently out in the cinema this year), (500) Days of Summer), Just Like Heaven, My Best Friends Wedding and so on. Heck this is the guy who thought Just My Luck with Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine was fairly entertaining. So there you go.All I ask for in a romantic comedy and for all those who have read my reviews on films like Date Night, Just Like Heaven and the abominable rom-com The Bounty Hunter know that you have two leads that are likable with reasonable acting, some nice chemistry between and with some moments of laughter, which isn't too much to ask. I certainly don't mind if some of these rom-coms are predictable, a bit cheesy or fluffy because that is to be expected. But certainly films like The Bounty Hunter, which I've just mentioned and The Ugly Truth, that are Hollywood propel leads that are selfish and stupid and are not likable in the slightest and you just wished that they all ended up getting exterminated or something. Well I'm afraid to say The Sweetest Thing has to join that extermination list.The first twenty minutes of the film aren't too bad with some great laughs and there were a few throughout the film like when Selma Blair has sex with her boyfriend in an elephant costume where she works. But it just got worse and worse with unfunny jokes, actions the leads take which make them unlikeable and implausibilities in the plot line. Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair have always been likable actors and they try their best to act, but the script makes them behave selfishly as it all becomes more and more filthy. I mean toilet jokes of urine etc is so old it becomes tiresome and really it's just disgusting. The way Diaz's character Christina Walter's acts. I mean my god. At first she just plays guys and picks them up but meeting a stranger propels her to travel across the state to gatecrash his wedding. I mean that in itself is just implausible. I mean she has barely known the guy five minutes and just goes to him. It's creepy, almost like she is stalking him and it's just wrong. She comes across as selfish thinking only of herself. I know, I know, later on she says it's spontaneous and that you can love someone at first sight and that people in love at first sight can do and make crazy spur of the moment decisions and I wouldn't have minded but there is not one ounce of romantic chemistry between her and him whatsoever so it really comes across as shallow and creepy. And if she really loved him. I mean at that point after the wedding I though I might give this a four star but right at the end when he turns up at her apartment and she runs after him and they kiss, she says it isn't good enough and he's not worth it. Cut the edit, he says she's a bitch and then he and her and her friends are sitting on the sofa where the camera zooms in and show they are married. For the audience to accept this situation is jaw-dropping like accepting that Tony Blair was a good prime minister. The message it gives out to me is she treats him like crap, he accepts it and doesn't mind and he marries her. If I was that guy and after she kissed me and walked off saying it was weak etc. I would have told where to shove it.Also it treats the idea of marriage like a joke, it is a sacred bond between two people, but at the altar no the man Chrsitina wants and the women he wants to marry suddenly realise bang! They don't love each other and just laugh about it. They act like idiots and don't feel remorse or sadness whatsoever. So why did they get engaged in the first place? If they were having doubts why didn't they say anything? Instead they waste they're own and all those that turned up's time and money. The movie is contemptible, childish and mocks you with the title. Another Hollywood rom-com that resorts to vulgar toilet jokes and shallow and selfish leads without charm, touching moments and zilch romantic chemistry, no wonder this flopped in the US. The only reason I give this a two was because there was some moments of laughter, but really this left a very sour taste in my mouth and if you see this it will for yours too.

The glory hole joke seemed more than forced and just a reason to show what might have been a penis. Since Scary Movie, I think it is in style to see if you can get away with it.The lead actor is the lead from Deep Blue Sea, which basically means he is little more than cardboard. But he really doesn't matter in this movie. He and Cameron Diaz's character's love for him just seems to be a reason for use to watch her and Christana Applegate chase him.So, in the end, the movie is only mildly funny, seems to be crude for the sake of it, hard to like lead characters as they seem shallow even when they have reformed so I give it a 4 out 10.

It's a cute, and occasionally funny film that with much more thought, writing and direction could have been sincerely funny and a comedy classic. It's also a shame that Christina Applegate who plays Cameron Diaz's best friend in the film wasn't the star because she was by far the most entertaining. However, the pairing together of friends Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate, and Selma Blair worked. Together it was a good start to a funny comedy. And the plot had potential too. A beautiful girl (although Cameron Diaz doesn't strike me as a particularly beautiful girl---to each their own I guess) who is a big time player with the guys suddenly and accidentally runs into a guy who takes her breath away and she can't forget him. With the help of her friends, she treks across the country to find him at a wedding. That's the basic plot. Somehow into this seemingly adult comedy...was added bathroom jokes, typical teenage urine and crap jokes, and of course three women who are complete tramps. It's funny how women will stand up against Ally McBeal, or Nicole Kidman's movies but they let three movie stars portray women as needy, sex fiends who enjoy getting themselves into disgusting sexually perverted situations. The movie was funny at parts, it's probably worth renting if you're up for some brainless laughs and some cute one liners. But overall the movie was Sex In The City meets Scary Movie with even less brains if you can imagine that. If it were not for the few inappropriate, stupid, disgusting, jokes, the movie would have been hilarious. The musical dress-up montage with Diaz and Applegate is priceless and very very funny and there are other very funny parts but unfortunately the movie is dragged down by the mainstream crap to bring the teenies out to see it.

Set in San Francisco, the trio of gals, close friends without a jealous bone in their bodies - Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and the truly amazing and impressive Selma Blair - mix longing for love with physical comedy and nonstop slapstick (often X-rated) humor.  Scatology is not neglected.The film works because the starring trio makes it work.  With hardly a nod to the women's need to earn their keep (there's one hilarious scene with shop manager Blair being distracted from her duties) they console, comfort and aid and abet each other's quest for romance.  The male actors play their very predictable roles well.  Heck, EVERYONE is predictable here.The best way to enjoy this fairly short film is not to take it too seriously. Or seriously at all. In other words, be like the movie's stars.

In the case of The Sweetest Thing, that's only true if your definition of everyone precludes people with feelings and brains. For everyone else, this is an equal-opportunity romp with a fair amount of giggles and jiggles.The jiggles come courtesy of Cameron Diaz, who has never been more artfully squeezed into hip-hugger pants and party-girl cliches. She plays Christina, a Bay Area bimbo about whom we learn the following She's afraid of long-term commitments, and she lives with two kindred spirits--lawyer Courtney (Christina Applegate, who steals the show) and rebounding romantic Jane (Selma Blair, whose sole function is to illustrate the slapstick consequences of indiscriminate copulation).The gals are manhunting at a disco one night when Christina lassoes Peter (Thomas Jane). In timeworn fashion, they joust, they wound each other, they disengage and they try a final sincere approach before Peter exits to another engagement. While her girlfriends cavort with their prey, Christina is left to wonder if she let a potential keeper get away.A few days later, with a prod from the gung-ho Courtney, Christina decides to tempt fate and surprise Peter at the small-town wedding he was planning to attend. For its middle third, the movie shifts into road-trip mode, fueled by the natural chemistry between Diaz and Applegate. This Cosmo-girl homage to Lucy and Ethel is reinforced by a fussbudget named Mr. Mooney and some especially yucky pratfalls in a roadside men's room.Although the shtick is this movie is often funny, it underscores the plot holes and tonal inconsistencies of the script (by South Park contributor Nancy Pimental). For instance, a pit stop at a dress store allows the girls to enact what they call a movie montage of dress-up gags (including references to Flashdance and Pretty Woman). It's a clever scene, but it contradicts their stated ambition to hurry to the wedding. Likewise, a trip to a dry cleaner with a semen-stained dress devolves into an absurd spiral of shame, and a paramedic rescue from a sexual predicament prompts a group singalong that tells us we're in an alternative universe rather than a believable love story. Indeed, Christina's pursuit is so sketchily motivated (and Jane is so unremarkable) that we never develop a rooting interest, except perhaps to take these two airheads off the market.The Sweetest Thing is best when it's just a couple of girls on the road, celebrating their freedom and friendship.

But with a very cool twist they're women.Since the dawn of time (or at least the 80s), we've been barraged with crass sex comedies, almost all of which are aimed at 16-24 year old males. Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Bachelor Party, American Pie ...and those are just the classics. Here we have a film that is every bit as vapid and morally bankrupt, but with the deliciously novel approach of being from the late-20s female perspective.Ladies, this is your chance to get even. Gents, this is your chance to see what really goes on during girl's night out ...or at least what goes on according to a slightly demented mind (that of writer Nancy Pimental who wrote 63 episodes of South Park if that's any indication). Let me put it this way I'm a guy who thought he had a moderately wild & crazy youth, but this made me feel like I've been living in Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. Kazowie! I found myself constantly thinking, Did I just see that??Although there's no explicit nudity, be prepared to see every possible suggestion of explicit sex in very funny ways. And I don't care what anyone says, the stain on the dress scene is a classic, as is the ...um, well, the scene where someone gets poked in the eyeball (and it ain't with a finger neither). These scenes, and others, are just so over-the-top ridiculous, it's as if Sex and the City got drunk and hooked up with Airplane! and this is their illegitimate offspring. Really, this movie doesn't just push the envelope, it bumps & grinds that envelope and fills it with bodily fluids.The story, believe it or not, is pretty interesting as a romcom and packs some good plot elements and a good twist or two. Cameron Diaz plays a party girl who starts thinking about settling down. Or is she just chasing after what every party girl wants the impossible? Christina Applegate plays her wing man while Selma Blair plays the quiet one completing a brilliant comedic trio.I have to admit, after the initial shock wore off, I really enjoyed this movie.

The plot is about as existent and important as one would expect of a porno.Given that review, one might ask why I've given it at least half of ten points. The movie is not without it's redeeming moments which include the aforementioned groping scene. If you want to see Selma Blair, Christina Applegate, and Cameron Diaz prance around in underwear and if you like the girl-on-girl implications, then you may be willing to overlook the fact that the story itself is poorly constructed.I've given this movie a five only because I am rating it based on what I feel it is an excuse to show off the bodies of three young actresses.

I'll be the first to admit that this is a chick flick and, sure, the plot may be a bit predictable and cliched, but it is one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in a long time.  If men wanted to get some insight into a woman's mind, this might be a title you want to check out.  While most guys don't have any idea how women act around each other and while most girls probably don't want men to know the way they really act around each other, this film does a great job of showing just that.  Women can be raunchy, idiotic, and have very, VERY unflattering moments, but they can have a pretty damn good time doing it.  Most viewers won't come away with any deep realizations about life from this film, but they will get some great laughs and sometimes that's all you need in my opinion.

Cameron Diaz has definitely done a fine job as an actress in the many films she has acted.Christina(Cameron Diaz), Courtney(Christina Applegate), and Jane(Selma Blair) are all single women who love to play with the minds of the men they meet during their active night life.  One night out, Christina meets Peter, and he tells her a truthful piece of his mind. They later meet again to start over and get to know each other.  Peter has to go to a wedding the next day, so they are cut short of time.  They have built up feelings for each one another.  Christina has the desire to find the man again and tell him how she feels.  Courtney finds out where the wedding is being held, and they venture off only to come back upset and disgusted when they find out why cops are all over Christina's apartment.  Peter comes to find Christina, because he can not stop thinking about her.  It was love at first sight, and they did not even know it.Roger Kumble,the director, had to add comedy to this love story so that it would be more appealing to the audience.  The comedy is sometimes so disgusting it is hilarious.  This movie is worth seeing because of the comedy and not just the sappy love story it is.Cameron Diaz does a fine job playing the blonde roles in movies.  In There's Something about Mary she had guys all over wanting to date her. As well as in The Sweetest Thing, her night life consists of guys wanting her. In the 1996 movie Head Above Water guys were getting jealous and killing each other over her, and she got killed in the process.

Unfortunately, the script is so mindless and predictable that all the pizzazz that Diaz can muster hasn't a hope of rescuing this film.This is yet another tired romantic comedy about meeting that one true love on the eve of his/her wedding.  The cast is energetic but the screenplay is lifeless.  Christina (Diaz) is the consummate party girl.  She never commits to a relationship.  When she runs into Peter (Thomas Jane) in a club they argue, he leaves and of course she falls madly in love with him and tracks him down on his wedding day, aided and abetted by her loyal friends Courtney (Christina Applegate) and Jane (Selma Blair).  There are a few funny scenes, but mostly it is just a parade of visual blonde jokes.Diaz is vivacious, energetic, cute, pouty and cold all at the same time.  This performance is a no brainer for her (literally and figuratively) and doesn't really test her acting ability.  Christina Applegate plays an uncharacteristically smart character and probably delivers the most dynamic performance of the cast.  Selma Blair is the least well known of the three, but steals just about every scene she is in.  Thomas Jane is soggy in the romantic lead with all the magnetism of overcooked pasta.This film laid an egg at the box office and rightfully so.  It had a good first week and then tanked as is often the case when a popular star like Diaz opens a mediocre film and word of mouth overcomes the initial hype.  I rated it a 5/10.

As with most comedies, it's not the story though, it's the way you tell it.

All delivered with machine gun rapidity that makes us believe this is what Cameron Diaz is like really. Actually, she's at that age (just turned 30) where she can still play a dizzy blonde yet with enough acting under her belt to make the part stand out (from award-nominated roles like Being John Malkovitch, action thriller roles like Charlies Angels and Vanilla Sky, and voice-overs in Shrek). Most of the audience howled with laughter (as I did) throughout the movie.

I love her goofiness, her un-vanity, her friendliness, her fierceness, and her inexplicable pride in that little bony rump.But as with all people we love, there is a version of them we love... not so much. Here, it's the she-stoops-to-conquer Cameron. The forced Cameron, the diving-in-the-mainstream Cameron, the...one doesn't want to say it, but the maybe-she-actually-enjoys-this-stupid-crap Cameron. That is to say, the Cameron of CHARLIE'S ANGELS and THE SWEETEST THING.The friend I saw SWEETEST with marched out saying, That was literally the worst movie I've ever seen! Well, it isn't--but I have a feeling the studio powers, and maybe some kind soul, like his agent or mother, will send the director Roger Kumble back to remedial comedy class. (Or maybe just recommend he...stick to dramas.) The writer, Nancy Pimental (who was awesomely handed $1,750,000 for this non-script) hands Kumble at least the opportunity for various build-up-and-deliver sight gags, and Kumble fumbles--drops, shatters, steps on and kills--each and every single one. When Selma Blair, as the plain-est and ho-iest of the trio of chickies who are our heroines, takes a Lewinsky-like stained dress to the dry cleaners, and a troupe of kids on a field trip marches in, your Blake Edwards detector tells you that a big set piece is coming that will top and further top itself. It doesn't--Kumble seems to cut away in mid-gag.The gimmick of the movie is SEX AND THE CITY with Farrelly Brothers gross-out gags. Sexist or no, there's an unseemliness in watching three thirtyish-looking women play out the kind of icky teen-comedy slapstick that unfurls here. When Christina Applegate squats on a dirty urinal in a men's room to take a leak, while Diaz gets poked in the eye with a dingus through a gloryhole--well, you just wish these women had better ways to make a paycheck this size.There were a bunch of twelve-year-old girls tittering happily at the horrible mess that is this movie, but one has to wonder how a movie this slipshod, insubstantial and, worst of all, charm-free got made. THE SWEETEST THING is TOMCATS or SAVING SILVERMAN with estrogen--only Sony produced this one in A-list, shoot-the-works mode. The sanest explanation I can find is that the sensibility of the movie--JAP-y, narcissistic, boneheaded, and in no way movie-ish--is the sensibility of the members of the sweeter sex running Hollywood.

Diaz, Applegate and Blair are all superb in their roles, displaying sexuality which makes the male audience drool.Basically, and with little else to say. the Sweetest thing is a good film. For the men we have three HOT women in superb roles who do the job they were hired to do. For the women, these three women also show a strong sense of independence. Ultimately, whilst the Sweetest Thing was never going to be a quality film, all the criticism it gets is unfair because it delivers exactly what you'd expect and proves to be simple entertainment.

Even though it's not superb, its overall point about women's lives is good, and the humor is spot-on. It reminded me of the spirit of Sex in the City strong, tough women who are loyal to each other and fiercely funny about their adventurous sex lives.I'm not surprised that most of the outraged comments are from men (you can tell because they're the ones who keep discussing how hot the female stars are). This breezy comedy is about the hazards and tribulations of the dating scene, shown through a woman's eyes. Any woman who spent her 20s dating a lot will laugh hard. So will any man who has some genuine interest in women's perspectives, and knows how to laugh sometimes at himself and his brethren. It's very common to see women treated like crap in films--tiny roles, often limited to girlfriends or whores; victims of explicitly-filmed violence; and mostly just used as eye-candy. (Another Cameron Diaz film proves this the much loved There's Something About Mary. Hey, folks, how many of you noticed this so-called comedy is actually about male stalkers, and the female victim of their voyeurism? Men tend to like that movie way more than women... gee, I wonder why...)By contrast, The Sweetest Thing shows women on top, so to speak. Three roommates call the shots in their fly-by-night relationships and laugh with each other over the craziness. The famed Penis song, which only appears on the un-rated version, and which many seem to find offensive, is one of the funniest points I've ever seen made in a film it's about men's absurd sense that their identity depends on their penis size... and the resulting labor that women have to do, to constantly praise their precious penises so the men won't curl up and die from inferiority complexes. Have any of you ever seen that point made in a movie before? Not likely. Is it a point worth making? Absolutely. It's one of the most common experiences women have, and yes, we DO talk about it with each other. If we lived inside a whimsical movie like this, we'd probably sing about it in a restaurant, too.How refreshing to see a cinematic representation of my gender that reflects some truth, where they're talking realistically and acting powerful, funny, and supportive of each other, instead of getting raped or put on display for male approval.Which brings us to why several men seem to hate this film 1) They're so insistent on women being sweet, soft creatures that they just can't handle seeing women talking crudely. How un-ladylike! 2) They can't stand the idea that women can be a bit callous and detached in their sexual adventuring. Only men are allowed that, apparently. 3) They actually believe that penis size defines their value, and therefore, their mental universe is deeply threatened by the discovery that women must strategically lie when praising their lovers' endowments. It's all about power some men just cannot stomach giving any of it up, or seeing women wield it. Get over it, fellas. It's the twenty-first century. The men I know who like this film (yes, there are some!) also like strong women, and know how to laugh at themselves. Those are the kinds of guys that appeal to the kinds of women who will love--absolutely love--this fluffy comedy.

Thomas Jane was rather bland though, and this is certainly not one of Diaz's best, however I though the Penis song was rather amusing. It's never boring, but never once was I in a fit with laughter either, and a lot of the jokes were misses (some hit), plus Jane and Diaz had no chemistry at all. Diaz, Applegate and Blair all looked very comfortable together, and had great chemistry and it had potential to be a very funny film, but it just fell short. The scene in the bathroom was quite funny, and Diaz can make anything watchable, plus the sex jokes did get a bit tiring after a while, and I usually love sex jokes. All the characters are extremely likable, and it's decently made as well, plus the soundtrack was good too. This is an average comedy, that had me chuckling only a few times at best, the fun performances by the three leads make it watchable though, worth the watch but don't expect much. The Direction is OK. Roger Kumble does an OK job here with good camera work, however the laughs are inconsistent, and this is nowhere near his masterpiece Cruel Intentions. The Acting is fun for the most part. Cameron Diaz is stunningly gorgeous, and gives a a wonderful performance, she's the main reason that kept me watching, she's just got something about her, I love her perkiness, after having said all that though, this is not one of her best films, or performances, she still did wonderful though. Christina Applegate is beautiful and does very well here as one of the best friends, she had excellent chemistry with Diaz, was very likable, and often funny, I dug her. Selma Blair is very funny as Jane, very cute as well, I just wished she had more screen time. Thomas Jane is rather bland as Peter, and looked awkward with Diaz. Jason Bateman is funny as Peter's brother. Johnny Messner is funny as the goofy BF of Jane's I dug him. Parker Posey has a brief role as the bride of Jane's she was OK. Rest of the cast are fine.

The female leads were easy on the eye and had distinctive and complementary characters. There were a few longueurs, a few full-on moments of hilarity, but nothing that could have possibly sparked off the gallons vitriol that so many reviewers seem to have poured so eagerly on a harmless piece of comedy fluff.And then I did a rough count of men compared to women, who hated the film. It's no surprise that most of the haters were men. No surprise at all. It's that old double standard - women can be objects of desire, objects of abuse, but let be in control, let them utter a few criticisms - joking or serious of masculinity, and the precious threatened male of the species starts to froth at the mouth!Are we men so threatened by a couple of penis jokes - taken to ludicrous extremes, possibly because men think of their penises in ludicrous terms - are we so offended to see on screen what many women, my wife assures me, discuss freely in private - that we are blind to how ridiculous the over-the top criticism of this movie must appear to anyone who hasn't seen the film?With all the ultra violence, generally perpetrated against women, that pollutes our screens, what is it with this unpretentious, fairly forgettable little film that gets men's dander up?

As ever Jason Bateman was awesome (when is he not?) and Thomas Jane as the love interest was cute and believable. Selma Blair had some great comedic moments and her dry straight performance made her antics funnier too.Hilarious, non stop laughs, mostly at the expense of adult humour, this isn't one for younger viewers, not a family film, but great for couples, girls nights in and even guys viewing (there's plenty to keep boys interested!)

This film is an anchor that brings down three credible female actresses Selma Blair, Christina Applegate (this makes Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead look like Shakespear in the Park) and Cameron Diaz who is way too talented to sing songs about the male genetailia and suffer the horrors of a truck stop bathroom.One could say I was being too critical and didn't get the jokes.

I thought I was a good at choosing a movie, but after deciding to watch this rubbish, I admit, I am not that great after all. I can remember seeing a trailer for it and thinking &#145;boy, this might be good for a watch'. How wrong could I have been? All this movie is on about is trying to be a sick and disgusting sex comedy. I like the aforementioned genre when it is done properly, however when it is done in poor taste, like this one was, it comes off bad. The script is one of the main problems with this movie, as it has many ideas that are not what I think make a good cinema experience. The screenplay was written by Nancy M. Pimental, who I believe added a lot of her own friends and life experiences within the script. The characters that she wrote were not what I would call likeable or charming. Unfortunately in my opinion, what Pimental brought to the bigscreen did not work.Then I have to ask what was Roger Kumble thinking when he took on directing this rubbish? Kumble did a great job with the &#145;Cruel Intention' series, as they are movies that I respected a lot. Yet with this film there was nothing that I found to be &#145;memorable', although I know that Kumble and his members behind the scenes really did try. If you have watched the movie you will know what I am talking about.  The movie stars some good actors. Cameron Diaz has done some really good work, which include such films as the Mask, There's Something About Mary and in the new Martin Scorsese movie, &#145;Gangs of new York'. But in this film her character is not one that I would say is all the bright or that attractive (and what I am talking about is inner beauty). Although the men in this film seem infatuated by her. Yet the other main stars are not much better. Christina Applegate has had a very unusual career, with of course being part of the famous TV sitcom, &#145;Married with Children'. My personal opinion of Applegate is that she is not that great an actress. There are some scenes with her character of Courtney, which are just plain stupid. Then what about Selma Blair. She has had some really good roles in her career so far, but what she does in this movie is not what I like to watch in a movie. The male actors of the movie were also given strange roles. Thomas Jane was forgettable as Christina's &#145;man of her dreams', John. Then there is his brother Roger (Jason Bateman) who again was a dumb character that was painful to watch each time he appeared on screen. Yet all the males that appeared in &#145;The Sweetest Thing' were either in a sick side of the film or in a part that was put there for sheer &#145;shock' value. On me that did not work, it made the movie experience all the worse. If you are wondering, I hated this film, I hated it a lot, and although I am sure it was directed at the female audience that was not the problem I had with it. It was what it tried to portray as the solution to your problems if you are unhappy that I found most disturbing (such as that of casual flings or sex). In my view, that is not how someone should handle relationship problems, as that attitude only creates more. The back cover of this film states that &#145;The Sweetest Thing' is a `sexy and surprising comedy that's somewhere between &#145;Sex and the City' and &#145;There's something about Mary' and it probably is.

There's a hearty backslapping for Selma Blair (courageous actress) and even some faint (if sincere sounding) praise for Christina Applegate, who stole most of the scenes from Diaz IMO. There was very little critical analysis of what the film was saying, or the fact that nowdays is far removed from the sixties, when this film might have actually been relevant.The Sweetest Thing tries too hard to prove chick humour can be as rowdy as male humour. Surely by now most people realise this, but just in case you haven't, the film will bombard you with the kind of scenes that are just don't feature in male-oriented comedy anymore, because they are - yep - too dated. So you'll get the scene where Diaz, Applegate and co (including token gay guy and funky sista) bum dance around to a song rhapsodising the penis. How outrageously funny!The film brings to mind another Diaz vehicle, There's Something About Mary. There's a semen scene. There's a couple of embarassing everyone's invited style moments reminiscent of Ben Stiller's zipper scene in Mary. There's golf. Except that it's not even in the same ballpark. If anything, The Sweetest Thing illustrates that despite its apparently slapdash nature, the wacky, gross-out approach by the Farrelly Brothers is actually hard work to make funny on screen. Sadly, The Sweetest Thing labours every point it makes, and for a female comedy, is remarkably ham fisted and unsubtle about the points it does make.The funniest scene is probably Diaz and Applegate doing a movie montage, but even this is undermined. Just to make sure that the audience understands it, they tell you they're about to do it. And that sums up the Sweetest Thing - obvious, giving viewers no credit for having a brain of their own, and just plain... lame.

During their attempts to find her Mr. Right Now, Diaz meets Peter Donahue, played aptly by Thomas Jane. Missing her opportunity with him that night, Cameron Diaz is talked into pursuing him to his brother's wedding. The ensuing road trip packs even more slapstick and locker room humor into an already-bursting movie. There is one character that I liked a lot. It was Selma Blair, she is shy and boring and then she turned to a ultra hot sex bomb. She is far from Cameron Diaz as the sexiest chick in the film but I'll do her anytime if I have nothing to do. The scene in the car with Applegate and Diaz is memorable, one of the best in years. I just love that animal horny look on Christina's face.

From the opening sequence when she boogies - badly - up the street to her character's apartment, you realise this is one of those films that seemed funnier to make than it's going to be to watch.  The first 10 minutes seem to set up a smart modern romantic comedy, and when Cameron isn't doing much there's some good observational dating and relationship comedy.  It quickly descends into a series of poor quality sex and toilet humour set-pieces - the dark side of American cinema's post-Pie discovery of rude jokes - that might have worked if the notional star gave any indication she has a flair for comedy.  The too big to fit in here musical number is probably hysterically funny if you're a woman who isn't comfortable discussing penis size over dinner, but like the film itself once the immediate shock-yok is over it outstays its welcome.

It's like the film has moments of real feeling and humor and then Airplane meets Farrelly Brothers wacko crap. Applegate and Diaz have real chemistry as friends and there are many funny, funny scenes in this mess of a movie. Not til the end credits did I realize the lead guy's brother was played by Jason Bateman - who gives a very strong, comedic performance. So as a rental - I think the movie makes for a fairly enjoyable night with some good laughs. But you can really see the battle this movie must have had behind the scenes over the tone because the tone is never consistent and they could not agree on what KIND of sex comedy they were making and because of too many cooks in the kitchen, the movie ultimately fails (but Christina Applegate gives a fantastic performance as the wild best friend).

Sure, it is unevenly directed, not very well focused, and I will even take exception with some parts of the ending later on in this little review - but for now all I can say is YESSSSSssss, it is about time someone made a movie just for real women.Take your Steel Magnolias and your Ya-Yas and your Moonlightings and Crossing Delanceys and Pretty Womans and Kissing Jessica or Jennifer whoevers and every other woman's movie made in the past few decades, especially that let-me-cater-to-every-pseudo-feminist-as-I-see-them fantasy called an Unmarried Woman. (although the only other woman's movie that I have seen that I love, namely Mulholland Drive, will be left out of my recycling bin, because that is a deeper and darker facet of the same jewel, even if men were led to believe that it was a guy thing because of the nude lesbian love scene )and put them where the sun don't shine (and women are all behind Bobby Blake, btw) because this is a real woman's movie.I don't really care that the direction was pretty poor at times. Who cares? finally we see us, as we really are, going out and partying. At any age. Any place we live. And looking for the real thing any time it may just pop up, which is the whole point of this movie, really. The brilliance of the Sweetest Thing is in how women treat men because of the way they are treated by men. We know when we go out on the town that we are not going to find Mr. Right. We always settle for Mr. Right Now. The problem with men is that they always think they found Miss Right Now who is looking for only Mr. Right. And so on. It is all games and playing until you both know it is something else. And that is what I love about this movie, the fact that it acknowledges the fact that both genders are well aware of this game, regardless of what men want to believe - and what most movies show to the average guy... Women just play it out a bit differently...Now for my dispute with the ending.. - SPOILER ALERT! - After all the time we get to spend knowing these women, it is incomprehensible that the Christina Applegate character would choose not to sleep with a real Mr. Right.

Still, The Sweetest Thing opens with a series of interviews with various men about their relations, brief and extended, with the movie's protagonist, Christina Walters.  The opinions expressed are uniformly bitter, especially those of a guy on a stationary bike who gets quite exercised (nyuk nyuk) on the subject.Christina is a San Francisco party girl, unattached and aggressively so, who flirts with a guy in a nightclub and brushes him off, but finds that she can't get him out of her head.  Her roommate (Christina Applegate), seeing her friend's state, shanghais her into a road trip to crash a wedding Mr. Nightspot mentioned he would be attending.That's pretty much it for plot.  Most of the movie concerns the misadventures the two women get into on their way, and a central plot twist that anyone who was paying attention spotted right away.  At first, The Sweetest Thing seems destined to become one of those Sigh, Where Are All the Nice Guys? movies, an archetype that wears heavily on the nerves of that segment of the audience composed of lonely and embittered ex-Nice Guys sitting dateless in the dark (I won't mention any names).  The movie thankfully veers away from that, and from an apparent temptation to use a relationship self-help book as a plot-structure guide.  Still, while the unusual opening may lead you to expect an edgy, different movie, it's fairly conventional, clever rather than brilliant, twisting cliches rather than avoiding them.  Like many others, the people who made The Sweetest Thing confuse edge with raunch, as though gross-out comedies were something new and ground-breaking.  While this one differs in being from the female perspective, that smells more like novelty than innovation.  Some of the jokes are inspired, some old, and many out of place (a visual gag involving an Arab and a Jew, which was funny in The Naked Gun! is, in light of current events, a little cringe-inducing).In the end, though, none of that stuff really matters much movies like this rise and fall on the charm and energy of the cast, and that deck is pretty stacked here.  In the lead (you could say the title role) Diaz is appealing and authentic, and doesn't shy from showing Christina's self-centered streak.  There was likely speculation in the studios that this would be Diaz's Pretty Woman, a romantic comedy that would showcase her magnetic charm and pave the way for a string of similar roles, but I doubt that will happen.  Diaz is too quirky and exuberant a performer for most traditional romantic-heroine roles, which are typically a little bland (the better, one guesses, for us to project our daydreams on).  She could do it, but she would have to dumb down considerably, and that would be a shame; she's a national treasure just the way she is.Good as Diaz is, though, a real revelation in this movie is Christina Applegate, as Diaz's lawyer sidekick and romantic field marshal.  With her deft timing, hilarious facial reactions, and spot-on comic deliveries, Applegate very nearly pulls off the impossible task of stealing a movie from Cameron Diaz.  As the third roommate, Selma Blair is definitely a side show, but turns in a likable good-sport pay-your-dues performance as the butt of some very out-there gags, in particular a funny scene where a trip to the dry cleaners' turns into a nightmare episode of This Is Your Life.  The Guy in Question is played by Thomas Jane, who does well despite being somewhat over-idealized, as objects-of-affection tend to be in these movies.  He and Diaz manage to keep their initial meeting scene from descending into overbearing cuteness, and his scenes with his brother (Jason Bateman, remember him?), nicely capture some of the ways that men, especially brothers, talk to each other.  Still, you get the sense from Jane that he's a little out of his depth here, that he'd rather be back battling the hyper-intelligent sharks of Deep Blue Sea.  At least there he knew where he stood.The Sweetest Thing ain't deep, but it's pleasant, and it goes down easily (that's not what I meant, get your mind out of the gutter).  Cameron Diaz is a joy both to look at and to watch.  Besides, can anyone really hate a movie that puts her in a stars-and-stripes bikini?  Well, some people could, I guess, but I'm certainly not among them.We've been a very good audience, so we get a cookie.  And that, after all, is why we came in the first place.

Quite frankly it's almost opposite it has a lot of scenes, that seem like they're done for a TV sketch sitcom. The over all plot is very thin, and would hardly be enough for a one half an hour sitcom episode. The direction is okay, not superb or spectacular, but okay.Diaz and Applegate both show very good sense of comedy, just like you'd expect of them. You even get to laugh out for a couple of times, if the comedy suits you.The biggest flaw of the film is the plot there real isn't enough of it and in many places it's filled with unnecessary fillers, like the movie montage scene, which is a small, strange scene with out any real content in the middle of the film.If you don't want to read the whole review, here's the summary okay comedy, but not great film making.

'The Sweetest Thing' only has the beautiful ladies. I have to admit, here the ladies are really good. Selma Blair is nice, Cameron Diaz is very nice and Christina Applegate is definitely my favorite and extremely nice.

The worst movie I have ever seen. And I am not over playing that statement. It's truly is the biggest load of garbage I've ever witnessed in an hour and a half or more.I have seen many bad movies. But this, piece of junk, smelled so vile, I almost considered changing the channel. But the idea of fighting out this pile of crap, would be a record breaker for me. So I watched the thing until the end, and I must say, I've never hated Diaz more than today.There was nothing original about this movie. In fact, it obviously hacked it's way into most of the Farely Bros. movies, as well as a few jokes from American Pie. But that wasn't the worst. The worst, was seeing these characters, (played by Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair) and there blatant stupidity. I thought Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were going to come pushing out of Diaz and Applegate at any time. But they didn't because at least they have some shred of dignity.The story was so bad, I wanted to surf the movie channels for anything starring Richard Greico. The plot never went anywhere. The synopsis would say something like this, Stupid woman meets stupid man at dance club. But he leaves without leaving his number. So her only option is to crash his brother's wedding (that she conveniently heard about at the club) to ask him out. But it turns out he's the one getting married, but the wedding is called off shortly after she runs away crying. So this stupid woman and the stupid man finally get together and they live happily ever after.Okay, wait. Yeah I just told you the whole story, but I probably spared you two hours, maybe even your life!Anyway, Diaz plays this airhead woman who seems to be unemployed with lots of money, and Applegate plays her airhead and slutty best friend who seems unemployed with lots of money. The two morons go to a dance club. Nothing happens for about ten minutes until Diaz meets this guy (I don't know his name, I don't care either) who seems just as dumb. They hit it off, and this guy's equally stupid Brother is said to be the one getting married. God, terrible. So blah blah blah... He leaves with his brother and Diaz is left to wonder what could have been. So in depression, Applegate wakes up Diaz and drags her on a three hour road trip to the Wedding, so she can finally approach her Dream Man. But when they arrive she see's that the dumb jerk is the one getting married. Not his brother. So she has a fit, Blah Blah Blah, the wedding is called off and they get together for a happy ending that is totally unoriginal and lame.Oh, watch the musical number in the Chinese Food Restaurant. I thought I was going to- you know, I can't really find the words to describe it. Except that if you watch the faces of Diaz, Applegate and Blair, you could almost see that they were officially waving goodbye to their careers.I saw Freddy Got Fingered, and cried. I saw The Sweetest Thing, and I wanted to put Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate, and Selma Blair through a blender, and drink the pulp. They truly lowered themselves to a new level. If that's really saying anything.If you watch this movie, and like it, you should be dragged out to the desert and shot like a lame animal.

Answer The Sweetest Thing &#150; the most entertaining dud I've had the pleasure to witness in recent years.On one hand, watching the Sweetest Thing is like driving past a multiple car pile-up (with fatalities) &#150; it's really, really bad but you can't help but watch; on the other hand, it plays like a dream come true (for me, at least!) &#150; Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair starring in a lewd comedy that continually entertains in the most unexpected and bizarre manner. How this movie got green-lighted I will never know, but I am glad it did!!Experienced man-eaters Christina (Diaz) and Courtney (Applegate) decide to help friend Jane (Blair) over her relationship-induced depression by taking her out on the town. Whilst in a nightclub, Christina meets Peter, who could just be the man of her dreams, but she opts out of going to a party with him, and later regrets her decision. Courtney talks her into pursuing him (to his brother's wedding) and what ensues is a zany road trip packed with slapstick and locker room humour.With the confident, sexually-in-control lead characters (played by Diaz and Applegate), Director Roger Kumble must have been aiming for a Sex in the City style girl-power comedy, but this isn't exactly what he delivers. The end result is a combination of crude hit-and-miss American Pie style humour, hot women, and jaw-droppingly out-of-place scenes that is just as likely to appeal to men as to women.Christina Applegate has been a favourite of mine since Married With Children and Cameron Diaz is also high on my top-Hollywood-totty list, so the two of them together are a real treat. Frequently appearing in skimpy outfits (or just their underwear!), I couldn't fail to enjoy this movie. But, for me, just as entertaining are the regular cringe-inducing moments which make you wonder why the actresses signed on the dotted line to make this film in the first place. So stupefyingly wretched are some of these, that you feel bad for watching; its the cinematic equivalent of visiting a freak-show at a carnival.So-bad-that-they-are-good highlights include the penis in the eye, Blair's blow-job that goes wrong, the movie montage, and (in the Unrated version) the incredible Penis song&#151;un-freakin'-believable! So if you're after a classy romance or a date comedy, forget it... I rate this film highly on account of its 'uniqueness', the depths that are plumbed in the name of humour and the fact that Christina Applegate gets her tits fondled by other women.

It's more complex than a mere love triangle. Extremely risqué, it's a chick flick and a romance for open-minded women, but, most of all, as far as I'm concerned, it's a vehicle show-casing Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair!This movie contains at least three raunchy yet romantic plots. The main plot is about a romance between Cameron Diaz' character and a man she off-handedly tries to interest in one of her female friends (played by Selma Blair), who's having boy trouble. Ironically, Selma's character seems to have no trouble finding boy friends for herself! Christina Applegate's character also finds romance, but I'm not going to spoil it and tell you who ends up or doesn't end up with who!My main interest in this movie was Cameron Diaz, whom I've found extremely attractive since I first saw a poster of her on a buddy's wall in the '90's, and even more so after seeing how sweet she was with Jay Leno on his Tonight Show, as well as in some of her endearing roles such as one of Charlie's Angels and the bride at My Best Friend's Wedding!This movie didn't show as much of Cameron as I would have liked, but as much as I would have expected. She shows off her sexy little hips, abs and navel in low cut pants and a short T-shirt (as seen on the cover) dancing and hanging over a bar, as well as in a bikini while examining, in a mirror, how much her breasts have started sagging. There's also an excellent scene where her character appears to be giving cunnilingus to Christina Applegate while Christina's character drives down a highway! Both of these gorgeous actresses appear in bikini underwear during this scene.Speaking of oral sex, there's also a particularly humorous scene where Selma's character is literally caught giving head to one of her boy friends. So caught, in fact, that the only way she is able to remove her mouth from the poor boy's pierced penis is by singing, which the crowd that gathers helps her to do by singing along!There's one scene where Christina looks especially fetching in a strapless red gown. There are other sexy scenes I've neglected to mention, but the point is, if you want to see any or all of these actresses at their sexiest, this is the movie to see!

How about throwing in a road trip and a nauseating amount of 'true lover conquers all'? What could possibly be better? Apparently, everything from a root canal to listening to Fran Drescher. This film is a mess. It's a chick flick romantic comedy with a road trip and loads of sex and crude humor. Who thought of combining all of that? A producer, probably, or possibly a group of them. Yes, they're far more dangerous when they flock. What really irks me is that this was directed by Roger Kumble, the man behind Cruel Intentions, a film I thoroughly enjoyed and found funny, entertaining and clever. This has none of those properties(possibly because he didn't write this one), and just falls flat in just about every category. It fails on every level. Really, with all the poor, often exaggerated humor, the out-of-place feel of everything in the film and the sheer pointlessness of the whole production, what you're left with is(uh, are) three attractive leading ladies. The plot is derivative and dull. The pacing is awful. The whole film drags by and when it's finally over, you're going to be either asleep or bored out of your mind. The acting is fine, but no one really 'shines'. The characters are clichéd and stereotypes. I could barely tell the three main characters apart(well, apart from their looks, naturally), since their personalities(or lack thereof) were so similar. The humor is crude and tries too hard to be provocative and offensive to the point where it completely forgets to be funny. The film just doesn't really entertain on any level, but I suppose male teenagers will get a kick out of the sex appeal of the film. If you do decide to watch it, and you're into crude humor(even slightly) and not too easily offended, make sure to pick up a European version, and make sure it includes 'the penis song'. I must admit, I did find that funny, even though it was so exaggerated and overplayed that it almost lost any potential to be even slightly entertaining. I recommend this to men who are attracted to at least one of the three leads and don't care too much if all they're getting out of the film is plenty of opportunity to glare at the three lovely ladies. I won't pretend I wasn't in this group when I sat down to watch it, but I will say that I'll most likely look for at least a tiny bit more substance next time. 5/10 "},{"Title":"too made up.","Date":"7 October 2004","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Before the movie came out,I was quite anxious to see it,because after the mask , just as lots of guys i know, i developed a bit of crush for Cameron Diaz(which later faded away).Still it was good to see her do another comedy - she was quite good as famous Mary.

They should have contacted the Herlihy Brothers for pointers.My biggest problem with this movie - and excuse me if it sounds lame - is there's too much of Cameron Diaz dancing in it.  I'm not kidding. She did the same crap in Charlie's Angels (even though that scene worked well for that particular movie).  I don't want to see her dance unless she's extremely bad at it and enhances the comedy.  Apparently, she's got it into her head that she's light on her feet and that she must incorporate 'bustin' a move' into all her movies.  For those unfamiliar, this is commonly known as Tony Danza Syndrome.  (Remember when Danza got it into his head that the dancing world had missed the boat on him and the next thing you know is we have to see him shuffle every week on Who's The Boss. Give it up people, no one cares about your hidden talents. And I do stress the word hidden. Sorry, end of rant.)Diaz is irritating, Applegate is alright and Blair is...whatever.  And I don't get Thomas Jane, who plays Diaz's love interest.  He starts off as an appealing character and then heads for a downward spiral.  At first he's witty and confident and then he regresses into a, well, boring loser. That didn't make sense to me.  The funniest person in this movie, surprisingly enough, is the usually annoying Jason Bateman.  His version of The Bangles Eternal Flame in the wedding scene was the funniest thing about the movie.I hate to say it folks but the sweetest thing about this movie is that you didn't pay full price for it at the theatres.

I laughed during the first 30 minutes. The gags are all cheap, juvenile and forced, but I was willing to let that slide.  When Selma Blair gets her skirt dry-cleaned (to get rid of a certain stain) and tons of people pour into the shop including her former grade school teacher, a field trip of little kiddies and even her priest, I still laughed.  This is the kind of far-fetched material that you often see in sitcoms, but it's supposed to be a goofy farce.  But then we get to the restaurant scene.  The girls ask Selma Blair how big her boyfriend's you-know-what is, and suddenly they bust into a musical number entitled, You're too big to fit in me, set to the rhythm of Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy.  That's when I rolled my eyes and screamed....WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???!!!!!  Even sitting alone in my room watching this scene, I felt humiliated.  I understand this movie was written by a female screenwriter, who was desperate to see females take a crack at the gross-out/sex comedy sub-genre, since we're used to movies like American Pie and Animal House, which are told through a guy's point of view.  Yes, I understand women can have filthy minds too.  As a matter of fact, most of my female friends have mouths 10 times filthier than those of my guy friends.  You think what the women in this movie say is shocking?  I've heard worse! That doesn't mean I enjoy hearing that crap.  Sure, it's funny at first, but then you just tell 'em to shut up and bring up the sarcastic Yeah...and us guys have filthy minds.  Tasteless sex jokes (from men or women) can be funny, but after a while they can run dry.  The American Pie movies were funny, because the gross-out gags were delivered in an intelligent, witty fashion. There's nothing wrong with dirty jokes; you just gotta learn how to deliver them.  It's all in the delivery and timing.  The girls singing, You're Too Big To Fit in Me is not funny; it's simply a cheap attempt for women to use a thousand penis euphamisms and get the women in the audience to applaud. If women are trying to even the scale when it comes to gross-out sex comedy, then name a movie where a bunch of guys bust into a musical number about vaginas!  If I saw that, I'd be rolling my eyes too!  I'm not being a sexist.If there's anything I have to say, the cast is full of energy and seems to be having a lot of fun.  But...maybe a little too much fun.  Slapstick comedy is tricky.  If not handled right, the movie can transform into a big old mess.  If you want an example of good slapstick comedy, watch Aresenic Old Lace and watch Cary Grant's performance.  The way the movie is written, the characters are thrown into wacky situations through natural causes. And Cary Grant plays the role of Mortimer Brewster completely straight, like he's dead serious about everything he's saying and doing, and not like he's in on the joke.  In this movie, the characters are thrown into wacky situations through ridiculous causes (What the hell kind of woman would walk into a cruddy men's bathroom, go into a men's stall and look through a mysterious hole?) and actors are virtually laughing at themselves!  Just acknowlege the scene in which Diaz appears to be giving Applegate oral sex and a greasy biker passes.  Now that's funny!  Leave the joke alone!  But then Applegate realizes that the biker thinks Diaz is giving her oral sex, and starts making cheesy moans and wagging her tongue.  The joke's not funny anymore!  The movie plays out like a home video in which everybody in front of the camera is having fun and they'll have fun watching it, but anybody who's not in the film is totally out of the fun.  There's even a gag reel at the end, proving my point.  It's like watching some stranger's home videos. There's even some totally pointless scenes, including one in which Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate do a montage, marching out dressed as characters from various popular films.Looking to see a cute romantic comedy?  Do not see this film!  The comedy is there, but the romance is virtually non-existent.  Only the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes fixates on Diaz's pursuit of her handsome Prince Charming.  Diaz and her love interest have good chemistry when they're on screen.  The problem is...they share very little screen time!  And we (the audience) don't understand a damn reason why she's pursuing this guy so adamantly.  They meet each other in a club, he's hot, she's hot, she buys him a drink, they hate each other at first, they sorta like each other the next minute, they have a little small talk.  OK, road trip!  I'm going after this b**tard!The movie wears out its welcome after the first 30 minutes.  The Sweetest Thing is not unbearable to watch, and worthy of some cheap laughs, but it has no cohesive structure.  I was surprised to find out Roger Kumble directed it.  Not that he's a great director, along the lines of Stanley Kubrick, but he directed Cruel Intentions, which was well-made.  It's delightful to see Cameron Diaz in a skimpy bikini, and it's delightful to see the beautiful Selma Blair.  Unfortunately, Christina Applegate stopped being hot (and stopped being funny) after Married with Children. Matthew Perry's Dad, John Bennett Perry, has some funny moments as the foul-mouthed father of the groom.  Is it the worst movie of the year?  Far from it. But it's nothing above average, never becoming any more than a throwaway comedy. Just when you think the grossness is over, another gratuitous gag comes along.  Towards the end, we have another pointless, unfunny gag involving Selma in a sticky situation involving a certain body part being stuck to a certain body part from her boyfriend.  If this were There's Something About Mary and directed by the Farrelly Brothers, the gag might've worked, but we're not in the hands of comic geniuses.My score  5 (out of 10)     "},{"Title":"This film is as sweet as a lemon...","Date":"27 April 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"       &#145;The Sweetest Thing' is a poor excuse to witness Cameron Diaz prancing around in her panties and dancing throughout the whole film. For good reason, she seems devilishly out of place in this brainless, pathetic and intolerable film. Disguised as a romantic comedy, this film attempts to amalgamate the gross out humour of &#145;There's Something About Mary' with the romantic tanglings of a formulaic and generic romantic set piece. Unfortunately, it fails on both levels.      Roger Kumble who helmed the two &#145;Cruel Intentions' films does a deplorable attempt at showcasing some feel-good romantic comedy with a dash of toilet humour. His lurid and vague directing offer the titrated script no reason to continue past the first 20 minute mark in which the greatest laughter is served. In short, there are many problems with this film. Seemingly enough, after viewing the film, it is clear that Diaz may not hold a film on her own. She needs the support of a solid supporting cast and instead in this film is reduced to Christina Applegate and Selma Blair.     These two underdeveloped and brash supporting female cohorts serve as a cross between the voice of conscience and a sick attempt at degrading sexual humour. It is obvious they are merely there to fill in the vacated plot gaps that arise out of a relationship centered film that almost has no relationship. Instead, the audience is served with risky fellatio where in which the object in question is pierced and results in a tangled situation. In addition, we receive the honour of having a great seat at dressing room sex in a men's store as Selma Blair and her boyfriend; who happens to be wearing an elephant costume, are engaging in the most animalistic of traditions.      With all due respect, this film is an atrocity and a triumphant example of when a studio wants to cash in on a star but does not provide the platform to create a hit. Nancy Pimental's tepid writing leaves much to be inquired about her strong attempts at recycling previous elements already seen in film. Furthermore, Roger Kumble's mediocre directing is a direct result of someone who is not passionate about the film and simply is there for the experience.       But what do I know? I am just an expert at seeing some really bad films and frankly have developed an eye for stupidity.  The least the filmmakers could have done is put some effort into this film. Instead they rely on a seemingly sedated Cameron Diaz who embarrasses herself in such trepidatious filth as this. In this one film she shall prove all her critics correct as she relies on the movement of her buttocks, her slim physique and her pearly blue eyes to masquerade the fact that she is not a very good actress in this film. I have not forgotten the Cameron Diaz I witnessed in &#145;Vanilla Sky', there was an actress who seemed self involved with her character and demonstrated it on film. Yet in this tired film, we receive a vagrant and foul exercise into Diaz's repertoire.       Need proof? Must we see so much skin in a script that does not call for it? Every opportunity that is available somehow conveniently fits into the grand schema of the script and we are subject to gratuitous and unfulfilling shots of Diaz in her stocky underwear and unattractive bra. That said, those looking for cheap thrills shall receive it, those looking for a decent film will thoroughly be disappointed. Diaz's love interest Thomas Jane is the only variable within this film that made a decent attempt at saving him the embarrassment.       Despite his limited screen time, this unappreciated actor (Deep Blue Sea, 61) makes the most out of his underwritten and boring character. As for the film itself, it's mundane and impersonal feel make it a bore to watch. The toilet humour at times may elicit a strong laugh only because of how ridiculous and staged it seems.  In short, this film is not sweet at all and serves up a very sour dish.

Whether the jokes are about bodily fluids is beside the point. This kind of humor is all about timing, and framing and setting the tone visually as a romp. This picture fails for the same reason as `Freddy Got Fingered.' The enthusiasm and commitment wasn't matched by skill.Watching this is a film school lesson some film humor can be invested in the performer. Jim Carrey or Robin Williams can do bits that make us laugh regardless of how framed. But the stuff attempted here is situational humor. The girls are not the jokesters, they are the dupes. We need careful shaping of the situation and then their reaction. For instance, we have a long setup where Ms Blair takes a dress to the cleaners with an embarrassing stain. The proprietor is a family friend, then in comes a class trip, and her third grade teacher, then her priest. The setup builds and builds faster and faster and then, what? the scene ends. No joke, no reaction, and no laugh.The funniest actress in this film is Parker Posey. Check out what she's done for Chris Guest, to see how she works as the target of the joke and then plays under the reaction. The other three can prance well enough, but just don't know what the director seems to have in mind. Carmen acts with her neck, Christina with her shoulders and Selma with her forehead. Take a look. Parker acts with her chin. Better for comedy.Ted's evaluation 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Where people drop everything in the name of love (even if this love interest has only been present for the aforementioned five minutes) Where men gaze at women with puppy dog eyes, their hair falling into their face as they explain earnestly why they had to lie to/leave/somehow hurt the girl of their dreams (they now know that she is the girl of their dreams, because they have now known each other for a full half hour.)

Which left the field free......The above sounds like a pitch for one of those traditional sentimental romantic comedies that always end up with a big white wedding for Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, or Hugh Grant and just about anyone.

The film, however, is not a rom-com of that sort at all. Far from it. It is just another example of Hollywood's recent mania for what might be called gross-out comedies, American Pie, There's Something About Mary (which also starred Cameron Diaz) and Scary Movie being others. The idea behind the genre is to try and make tastelessness an art-form in itself. There are plenty of attempts to get laughs out of sex, but it goes beyond mere bawdiness. Just as important are the attempts to get laughs from jokes about bodily functions, the cruder the better. The plot of the film is little more than an excuse for a string of gags of this nature.Unfortunately, the attempts to get laughs are fated to remain just that- unsuccessful attempts, although that is not due to any want of trying. We get a semen-on-a-dress joke (possibly inspired by ex-President Clinton's misadventure with Monica), a girls-in-a-men's-toilet joke, a girl-making-love-to-a-purple-elephant joke (don't ask), vomit jokes, more toilet jokes and a Grand Lesbian joke. Occasionally, films of this sort can provide a few crude belly-laughs (there were, for example, some genuinely funny moments in There's Something About Mary), but The Sweetest Thing just provides the crudeness without the laughter. It ends up as an example of that saddest type of film, the failed comedy. All those involved- most of whom are capable of much better work than this- should be ashamed of themselves.I note that one reviewer calls this film fun to watch after a night on the beer while another tells us to watch it with a bottle of wine. In my case I doubt if either of those beverages would be strong enough to persuade me to watch it again. I would probably have to be out of my skull on neat vodka before I could find it funny. There is an old maxim that nobody ever lost money by underestimating the taste of the public. Until now, that is. The failure of The Sweetest Thing at the box office means that there is at least one exception to that rule. 2/10 "},{"Title":"Truly awful","Date":"21 April 2006","Score":"5 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" I meant to hire this film when it first came out but kept forgetting. I finally watched it when it was on terrestrial TV one evening. Am I glad I didn't shell out the money for the rental. It was terrible! I hated the actors (Cameron Diaz was embarrassing, Christina Applegate just looked embarrassed and pouty Selma Blair was very irritating), I hated the characters and I hated the plot (what there was of it!).The film's one redeeming feature was that it was mercifully short, barely clocking in at an hour and a half. When I watched it (on Channel 5 in the UK) it was just over 90 minutes - and that included advert breaks and a newsflash! Which is a pretty good indicator to just how little substance there was in this film which already contains quite a bit of padding. When it ended I was like, What, is that it? It was incredible how little storyline there was and the whole thing played out like an extended episode of a (not very funny) sitcom. It was like someone had written the jokes first and then fit the plot in around them. Prime examples would be Jane dropping off her dry cleaning with the 'shame stain' &#150; a lengthy and largely unnecessary 'comic' scene that contributed nothing to the plot and was a typical ingredient of your garden-variety sitcom &#150; Wouldn't it be funny if all your family saw you with semen on your dress?, Wouldn't it be funny if a guy got his penis caught inside his girlfriend's throat and had to call the paramedics? And then all these other people come in and see it, and, and&#133;.The film was episodic and clumsy, the characters underdeveloped and completely two-dimensional. I found nothing to like and admire about them &#150; in fact I didn't even care enough to hate them! It wouldn't have been so bad if Christina and Courtney had been portrayed as two professional thirtysomething women whose attitude to and string of relationships with the opposite sex are a testament to their maturity and modern-mindedness (ala 'Sex & The City'). Instead, the two of them behave like a couple of giggling schoolgirls which, for two women in their thirties was neither funny nor attractive. Moreover, we have to suspend our disbelief a little further that Christina and Courtney are professional women with careers (I think Courtney's supposed to be some kind of lawyer) which is why the scenes of them acting like imbecilic sorority rejects is so hard to swallow. In short, they're too old for this! It's like, Grow up already! Probably the main reason why I was so disappointed with this film was that I felt deceived (yes, deceived) by the publicity. The film doesn't look too bad in the trailers and I was expecting a rom-com from a similar school to 'There's Something About Mary' with the goofy feel-good quality of a film like 'Shallow Hal'. 'The Sweetest Thing' was obviously intended as some kind of reactionary piece to the boys/men behaving badly comic ensembles such as 'Porkys' or the 'American Pie' films &#150; a kind of women behaving badly or Look, look! Women can be gross and dirty-minded too! But it just didn't work and needed more than just Christina meeting Mr Right. How about Christina and her friends growing up and stopping acting like a bunch of irresponsible dumb blondes? I apologise if I've been quite scathing of this film (there are worse ones) but it just infuriates me that such a movie whose only selling point is that it stars three good-looking actresses should be spat out by Hollywood and make it onto the big screen. Very disappointing and not to mention lazy. Avoid!

However, the blame for my complete lack of enjoyment of this film I rest entirely with the film itself. It is in all honesty the least funny comedy I have ever seen, and quite easily the worst film that I have actually paid money to watch. This isn't just a comedy with few laughs, most of which are unintentional, it also contains numerous elements that made me hate every second that I had to spend in the cinema watching it. To begin with, the three main characters are so dislikeable as to completely detract from the point of the film. Cameron Diaz's character is shown in the opening sequence to be quite a nasty person in the way that she treats her boyfriends, and so it is surely impossible to sympathies with her in any way when the same thing happens to her later on. Christina Applegate's transformation from a cold heartless maneater to all loved up is brushed over so quickly that it seems a bit of a pointless afterthought by the writer, while Selma Blair only serves to fill up time that could really be spent doing something more interesting, like not watching this film perhaps.All of the films shortcomings could perhaps be overlooked and wiped from the memory, if it were not for the excruciating Penis Song, which only served to double the pain of my headache, beg for mercy, and ask the heavens what crime I had committed to be subjected to such a travesty of film-making. I still have nightmares to this day.I concede that this film is definitely aimed at the female race, more specifically men-hating girl power types, making it unlikely that I was going to get much out of it.

It's American Pie meets Bridget Jones. Cheap humor for young adults (?!) Silly and childish remarks on sex and the dating game as a whole.Girl meets boy. Falls in love. Things happen, life comes between them and they finally reunite. Happy ending? It would be, if I had my money back (plus interest). How many times can you tell the same story over and over again?You know the plot. You've tried to laugh at similar situations and failed. You've seen the ending. You promised yourself you would never watch a similar movie again.The comedic situations are complete cliches and the movie not only lacks originality but decent comedic performances. The characters are self-absorved, intellectually handicapped, shallow young professionals with nothing to say. You almost root for them to end up miserable and alone.It's just not funny at ALL. On top of it, in the middle of the so-called funny dialogues, there are some really annoying musical sequences.If you had the unpleasure of renting it on dvd, you'll have to deal with extra previously cut scenes.One and a half hours gone to waste (seemed like three though).The only bright side of it was Christina Applegate looking sexier than ever.I cannot believe this movie was ever made. This proves that Hollywood can produce as much crap as decent movies. Unfortunately, big-budgeted, low-neurone, moronic scripts like this seem to prevail.

There was absolutely no plot and it seemed like the director and actresses made it as they went along. Various scenes in the movie left me speechless as they were just so bad and seemed to come out of nowhere Eg. a scene with Applegate peeing into a urinal whilst Diaz stares through a 'glory-hole' in a toilet cubicle wall only to get poked in the eye with a penis; a movie montage between Applegate and Diaz in a clothes shop, a simulation of oral sex again between Applegate and Diaz as they are driving on the freeway and not forgetting another oral sex scene featuring Blair in which her tonsils get stuck on the guys piercing. Funny? I think not. It seems that the director wanted to shock the audience with such scenes - and he succeeded. But only because they were delivered so unprofessionally and completely out of the blue, owing absolutely nothing to the credibility of the movie whatsoever.I normally regard the movies three main actresses - Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair - to be good at what they do.

It occasionally has its funny moments; but it ought to have a lot more of them if it wants to be considered a comedy (or even a romantic comedy, comedy's dim-witted cousin).I can understand why this flick inspires such contempt, however. While it is, for the most part, harmlessly bland; it occasionally sinks to unexpected depths of badness. The worst instance of this is when, without warning, the infamous penis song comes along. Someone posted that this is in the uncut version, and possibly wasn't in the theatrical release. Wow, I hope that is true. This should have remained on the cutting room floor. This should never have been shot in the first place. The whole sequence (the song and the dialog leading into it) is the worst- what? five? ten? - minutes ever committed to film. It is almost admirable for being truly, spectacularly awful. Almost. It crosses the line between things that are just generically bad and things that are iconically bad (think Showgirls). Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there -- it keeps on going into previously uncharted areas of horribleness. Again, because I can't stress this enough this is the most insufferable scene in motion picture history. New words would have to be invented to accurately express how shockingly repugnant this song is.But then it's over, and the movie returns to its generic mediocrity.

Hell, as a MST3K fan, I like a lot of bad movies! But this movie is a total embarrassment to all involved and I feel sorry for the actors degrading themselves as they did. Why did they take these roles? This is easily the worst movie I've seen since Battlefield Earth and it might be worse than that was -- I'd have to see B.E. again to compare, which I won't likely do.Where did this movie go wrong? Everywhere. All the aspects of movie-making -- scripting, directing, acting, casting, lighting, make-up, etc. -- demonstrate a lack of talent from the people involved. But the blame for this train-wreck falls squarely on two people first, the writer Nancy Pimental and then the director Roger Kumble.Watch the DVD's special features. It will introduce you to Nancy the writer and expose her for exactly what she is an air-headed bimbo who's so dumb that she thinks she's smart. Her only talent apparently is that she's hot enough that somebody was willing to pull strings to sleep with her. The commentary also exposes the director to be a shallow, talentless, brainless low-life. Both these two people should never, ever, *ever* work on a major Hollywood production again.Regarding the leads? Diaz sank so low after this movie. Applegate should have simply refused to do some of the things asked of her. Blair I didn't know much about and now I don't want to. Bateman, I haven't seen him for a while and would have been willing to give him a chance to upgrade from third tier actor but he missed this chance. But I was glad he gave the director a jab in the commentary towards the end.If you like movies and the movie industry, this might be worth watching to see what *not* to do.

I have never stared at the screen in such awe of so much overwhelming badness, even while watching such cinematic nadirs as Wing Commander.  I can't believe that this isn't on the IMDB Bottom 100 List.  I can't believe IMDB hasn't invented a new standard of putrescence, a new list, solely because of this horrendous abomination of a movie.Here are a few reasons why this movie sucks so horribly badly1.  It's more than 5 minutes long.  Seriously.  All the quality of this movie is in the fact that the three female leads are fairly attractive, so the film makers should have just paraded Diaz, Applegate and Blair in front of the camera for a few minutes and definitely rolled the credits before the first line of dialogue, because at that point the movie just revealed itself for the awful, fraudulent, movie that it is.2.  It features a glory hole  For those of you who don't know, a glory hole is a hole in a wall (leading who knows where) where men can stick their penises in hopes of sexual gratification.  Apparently there are men who are comfortable using their penises as an exploratory tool but I'm not one of them.  Undaunted, the puerile delinquents who unleashed this monstrosity upon us not only feature one prominently, they have Cameron Diaz stick her head up to it whereupon she is struck in the eye with a penis. Don't worry, it isn't as funny as it sounds, especially since the penis looks like a big turd.3.  It features Jason Bateman.  Who, you ask?  That name rings a bell, you say?  Why, he's the lesser known, lesser talented brother of Justine Bateman.  I haven't seen him in a movie since Teen Wolf Too.  But one of the savant producers of this movie apparently saw fit to give him another job.4.  It has a movie montage. You know, a scene in which music is played loudly and characters parade by the camera dressed up or posed like characters from movies past.  Of course the cardinal rule of movie montages is that you can't have characters say Let's to a movie montage and then start mugging for the camera like a Fox news anchor.  But that's exactly what Diaz and Applegate do - they walk back in forth in front of the camera and stare in its general direction.  Why?  Who knows, maybe they are trying to slyly let the audience know that they're aware of their presence, and they're sorry.5.  It features an octogenarian woman singing about big penises.  Yes. It's even more painful than it sounds.  Imagine your grandmother singing Big penises!  Big penises!  It's hard to fit big penises in my little vagina! OK, those weren't the words but that's the gist.  I mean, what the hell?Oh, in case you're wondering why this movie is called The Sweetest Thing, and are considering seeing it just to find out the lame reason for the lame title of this lame movie, I'll let you know (I hope this doesn't count as a spoiler)  Thomas Jane's character says it for absolutely no reason except that writer Nancy Everything I Need To Know About Dating I Learned From Hanging Out With My Cat, Eating Bon-Bons, And Reading Bodice-Rippers Pimental clearly thought up the title and wanted to put it in the movie to justify it's existence.

I've also read that everyone involved in making The Sweetest Thing had a great time. My first reaction on seeing the list of main players was that something with both Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate in it must be worth a look.  Having seen this film I wish I'd had the presence of mind to lie down in a darkened room until the desire to purchase the DVD had passed unfulfilled. In other words, I was very disappointed. The cast are real troupers, they deal enthusiastically with crass dialogue, feeble humour and the  abandonment of sauce for vulgarity. The music is poor, in fact the penis song is unbelievable. Between cringes, I yearned for the inspired Springtime for Hitler. Those were the days before alternative humour. Anyone interested can have a look at The Producers (1968).Cameron Diaz doesn't seem at her best as Christine Walters. She doesn't quite seem to justify top billing. I think Christina Applegate has the more dominant screen presence playing Courtney Rockcliffe. I've heard there's a debate in some quarters about whether or not CA actually has a range beyond the air head bimbo in Married.....with Children that made her internationally famous. I remain neutral, but anyone watching TST might be interested in Applegates's characterization of Julia Malfete in Just Visiting (2001), a light hearted time travel story with thought provoking moments.  Selma Blair's performance in TST is a genuine plus. Thomas Jane makes a decent  job of his role too. TST is the first time I've spotted  either of them. I wouldn't mind seeing their future appearances. And, let's hear it for that appealing character actress Georgia B Engel and her colour de luxe dress shop.  She's enlivened so many shows, classic and turkey alike. There's also Parker Posey in a wedding dress. I can only recall seeing her in the enjoyable You've Got Mail from back in 1998, but I know she's done other things.  Sadly, I don't think it is in the interest of the more recognizable faces to recall too loudly their involvement in this movie.

Pouty lips when she's sad, come hither eyes when she's horny, and huge, toothy grins when she's happy.  Her spectrum is truly mind boggling.

Don't actors get to read scripts before they decide to join?I thought I was renting a comedy, but if there's no plot, when the jokes are lame and the idea of humor is simply referring to penises it can't be anything else than complete CRAP and a total waste of time and money.Others have put it down in better words.

I don't know what the studio was intending to produce but what came out is a terribly ungraceful, unfunny and simply awful cross between There is something about Mary/American Pie/My best friends wedding. It fails to deliver any of the surprise, any of the amusement and certainly any of the style of the three originals. I knew it was bad, thanks to Mark Dinning's review in the latest Empire and thank God I only borrowed a copy from a friend because Oh boy, if I actually paid anything for it I'd probably try to sue the studio.That was simply the worst chick flick I saw in ages, in fact, I cannot thing of seeing anything worst ever. The only good thing in it was the acting and even here Christina Applegate was on the top with Selma Blair closely following in terms of performance.

It is absolutely terrible. It is unintentionally funny in manyparts and the intended humor falls flat 90% of the time. In theirattempt to be over the top the film tries to outgross such films asAmerican Pie and There's Something about Mary. Yet it doesn'thold it's tone. It varies from Say Anything mock seriousness toAirplane sight gags and laughably bad musical scenes. I feltembarrassed for Cameron Diaz and Applegate in this film,although they were not only unabashed but enthusiastic in theirroles for this awful film.  This merely shows that some actors andactresses have no idea what good material is and they will doanything for a buck. Sad, because Diaz showed herself to becompetent comedienne in Mary and dazzlingly likable in TheMask. The biggest lesson one takes from the film is that you mustmaintain TONE throughout the picture.

Don't get me wrong, I like Cameron Diaz, but this was not her best performance.  And if this is girls, someone had better help us all!  I found the raunchy sex and toilet jokes, well, not funny.  They were gratuitous and unfortunately clearly geared toward a generation that I don't understand.  This could have been a harmless, entertaining movie about how girls are becoming just like guys without all the nasty stuff. I hope Cameron and Christina pick their next project more carefully.  Too many like this and they will be yesterday's new.  It was escapist and had some rewarding, funny moments.  The ending was clever and I do like a good ending.

Yet she's trapped inside the trainwreck that this film is. I laughed about 2 times in this movie. 1 @&%$ Grandma. The second was a scene where many women crowd around a ladies restroom in a SF club to fondle Christina Applegate's breast. I laughed at the idea of this scene, yet quickly stopped laughing as the joke just went on and on and on, and was beaten to the ground. The direction was so inept in this movie it was as if the stars were just given free range to do whatever they wanted. It didn't work. The scene where Jane gets something caught in her throat was a direct rip off of Something about Mary, but just didn't work. The sobbing cop, the gay cop, the random break out in song, it was too stupid to laugh it; I was too confused. This movie didn't seem to know what it was trying to accomplish. The serious scenes were poorly written, the comedic scenes had no sense of timing, and then out of nowhere random gags would arise out of nothingness. Truly inconsistent, random, and unpleasant crap.

Maybe they lost a bet or, in Selma Blair's case, owed the director a favor.  The penis song in the restaurant is quite possibly the stupidest thing I've ever seen on film.  Hopefully the director learned that, unless you're the South Park guys, you shouldn't try to mix vulgarity and musical number.  Please, do yourself a favor and skip this movie.

In fact, I might actually watch it AGAIN just to do that. I actually loved... (um I forget her name but she played Vivian) in Legally Blonde, and I was happy to see her in another movie but I didn't think this was really her best role... *eyeroll*It's also a movie that you can love and hate for the same reasons. For most normal women, watching these three waify chicks in their hiphuggers and belly baring shirts and rockin' bods can make you just want to submerge yourself in a pile of cheetos.... on the other hand they do look very cool and if you have a best friend you can kinda relate to the relationship between the two main characters. It's dumb, but if you go into it knowing that, and just be prepared for silly snorting campy humor, it's worth seeing as a rental. The Penis Song alone is really worth watching it for.
