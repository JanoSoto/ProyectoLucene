[{"Title":"That Legendary Melancholy Dane","Date":"8 October 2005","Score":"40 out of 48 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" With this film, Sir Laurence Olivier set the standard as to how Shakespeare should be done on screen. His direction of his handpicked cast was flawless and his own straightforward interpretation of Hamlet is the one everyone else's is measured by.It was a straightforward interpretation because Shakespeare himself in the introduction says that Hamlet's tragedy is one in which his problem is that he couldn't make up his mind. Olivier opts for that and doesn't try to give any deeper meaning to Hamlet's indecision.For those who've never read the play or have seen it or studied in school, Hamlet is the Prince of Denmark. He's Hamlet Junior. His father Hamlet Senior was the king and the king has died. But at the beginning of the play, Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father and the father tells him he was murdered by his brother Claudius. Claudius took the title and married Hamlet's mother Gertrude. All this was done while Hamlet was away at school in Wittemberg.The ghost wants his son to revenge him, understandable enough. But the story is Hamlet deciding one thing and then another, moderating his course. His actions have everyone believing he's lost his mind. In the end it's tragedy all around.I've always thought that the key thing to remember is that Hamlet is the only one who heard the ghost. Some other palace personnel told him about some apparition making an appearance on one of the battlements of Elsinore Castle, but Hamlet's the only one who's been told the tale. Therefore he's the only one who heard the story and he can't prove anything. The device of spirits visiting Shakespearean protagonists is one the Bard used with great effect. Here, in MacBeth, in Julius Caesar, all of those visits meant someone was meeting their doom. But in Hamlet the ghost makes his appearance at the beginning of the play. Maybe if the ghost had revealed himself to Horatio, to Polonius, the Queen even, Hamlet's duty would have been clear.In the supporting cast I liked Eileen Herlie as the Queen, Jean Simmons as Ophelia, Felix Aylmer as Polonius, and most of all Terrence Morgan as Laertes. Laertes is an important character here. He's the son of the chief counselor in the court, Polonius and brother of Ophelia who has a yen for Hamlet. In the beginning of the play Laertes takes off for France. Later towards the end he finds out the tragedy Hamlet has wrought upon both his father and his sister and Laertes has no trouble making up his mind what he's going to do. Quite a contrast to Hamlet's behavior.The film is moodily photographed in black and white. Olivier wanted to use color, but J. Arthur Rank wouldn't spring for it. So he made due with black and white and the lights and shadows of Elsinore castle as shown almost make this version a kind of Shakespeare noir.I don't think subsequent versions with Nicol Williamson and Mel Gibson hold a candle to this one.

Olivier's personal performance as the Danish prince is by far the strongest aspect of the picture.Hamlet is one of the most complex and fascinating characters ever created, and no two great actors ever play him quite the same way.  Olivier portrays him primarily as a man who could not make up his mind, and his fine and often subtle acting brings to his role a deep understanding of his character's inner struggles and dilemmas, both moral and practical.  He renders Hamlet's most famous lines in a distinctive way that reveal the many possible paths in Hamlet's future.  It is a performance not to be forgotten.If Olivier the actor is masterful, Olivier the director is good but not perfect.  A great deal of Shakespeare's text was eliminated, getting the running time down to 2 1/2 hours, but even so there are times when the movie seems rather slow-moving, especially in the first hour or so.  Most of the cuts involve interactions with the minor characters, and some of the original play's minor roles are cut completely out of the film.  The result is to concentrate the emphasis even further on Hamlet himself and on his pessimistic meditations.  While this enables Olivier's fine acting to become even more prominent, it does eliminate some very interesting portions of the story whose absence will be regretted by those viewers who love the play.Olivier does add some good touches, though.  He emphasizes the somber tone with numerous tracking shots of the castle's gloomy corridors and staircases.  The filming of the famous sequence of events at the end is very good, and is much livelier than the rest.While this is probably not the very best interpretation of the play Hamlet, it is as good an interpretation of the character Hamlet as you will ever see.  For that reason alone it is must viewing for any fan of Shakespeare or of Olivier.

Like all of the Bard's works, his endurance is not only the mastery of language, but really in storylines that just never get old. Above, everything else, Hamlet is an interesting tale. Olivier's interpretation however, is very dark. Very deliberate. He shies away from the humor completely, and instead takes a slow, purposeful tack. To that, it might not appeal to some. In such a long play and movie, the humor is sorta needed to jostle you a bit, and break the overall bleakness of the tragedy. You don't catch a break here I'm afraid. Id classify this therefore as for more advanced taste, and not for the average moviegoer. Olivier's other two attempts, Henry V and Richard III, specifically the latter, will garner more mainstream appeal.

This gives the sometimes ponderous adaptation atmosphere and the black and white photography is gorgeous.  Amongst the supporting cast Jean Simmons is a childish, doting Ophelia but this works well.  Not working so well are the soliloquies largely within Hamlet's head (and therefore, voiceover).  This seems a little gimmicky and only really makes sense with 'To be or not to be'.That aside, this really is Larry's show and he is brilliant.  Despite a few cuts it does the original play proud and is, like Welles' Macbeth and Othello, a truly cinematic reading.

I still think it's a masterpiece, however now it fills the second place in my preferences and the first one belongs to Lord Laurence Olivier. To begin with, I was astonished to find out that scenery, costumes and make-up in Kozintsev's film clearly resemble those from Olivier's version. No doubts, our producer knew and appreciated earlier English movie and deliberately copied the settings. Well, I don't blame him he used it successfully, but the lack of originality is somehow disappointing.  The scenery is really wonderful cold, gloomy, dark, gothic, haunting and even more impressive for being black-and-white. And then&#133; LORD LAURENCE OLIVIER IS THE BEST SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR EVER. No one else can make the 16th century Bard's text sound modern, natural, alive, expressive, exciting, clear and full of hidden before meaning. Indeed, soviet actors pronounce the text fantastically well, but in Russian I mean in translation by talented Russian poet Pasternak. And recently I've become interested in reading and watching Shakespeare in original. And here Olivier is an unparalleled performer. He portraits his hero wonderfully. His Hamlet is dignified and noble, reserved and mistrustful, emotional and ruthless (when he knows it is justified), and deeply frustrated (for he is disappointed in everyone except the foreigner Horatio). He is willing to act and yet waits to understand what's happening better. However events take an unexpected course and lead to the final tragedy. At the beginning Hamlet is called `a man who couldn't make up his mind'. Well, I would choose other words `a man who changed his mind too often', but it wasn't his fault &#150; so were circumstances. And Olivier presents these changes very vividly and truthfully. He makes `To be or not to be' an unusually powerful scene showing Hamlet just a man who sees so much evil all around that he nearly commits suicide. He is stopped only by sudden understanding that death is unremediable and too frightening &#150; natural thought for any sensible man, brave as he is. Such simple variant pleases me better than more sophisticated ones. Somebody may disagree with Olivier's conception of the character but everyone has to admit that while Larry acts he creates complete, convincing, living image of his hero (and very sympathetic, by the way).  I also would like to mention Jean Simmons. She seems to be severely misjudged by most reviewers.  Simmons is an excellent Ophelia &#150; a simple, naive young girl, merely a child, affectionate, light-hearted, playful, flirting and exceptionally sensitive. An absolutely charming scene is that of Laertes' departure. Polonius makes his solemn speech and Ophelia all the time mischievously distracts attention of her brother. I like all Olivier's films for such amusing trifles. Gertrude is well chosen too, quite believable. Eileen Herlie clear shows that at the end Gertrude understands her husband's wicked game and takes the poison consciously. However, Claudius is not impressive enough, to my mind.  To see a perfect thrilling Shakespearean villain you have to watch Kozintsev's film. Of course the play is noticeably cut. I confess I miss Hamlet's passionate soliloquy `Is not this monstrous that this player here&#133;', and also Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (they are important, for Hamlet faces the treachery of friends in their part). On the other hand more complete versions are rather overlong. I am not sure that Branagh's four hours movie gains anything from using the full text. This film is dynamic and worth seeing not only for the sake of Lord Laurence's outstanding performance, but because it is extraordinary interesting version of the familiar play.

It seems that Olivier's father (voiced by John Gielgud) still roams the Earth as a spirit that walks around aimlessly, unable to find Heaven or Hell (Purgatory for the most part). Gielgud makes it clear that his brother (Basil Sydney) was the culprit in his death and Olivier becomes enraged. The fact that Sydney has become king by marrying the titled character's mother (Eileen Herlie) just makes the tension build. Herlie and Olivier's relationship pushes the envelope hard on a typical mother-son bond (there are incestuous tones abound here). Oscar-nominee Jean Simmons appears to be Olivier's one true love, but after a terrible tragedy she falls down a path of mental anguish. It appears that the only logical conclusion for Shakespeare's famed character is to have that famous sword fight dual with Simmons' brother (Terence Morgan). Of course you know that not everything is the way it seems, right? Hamlet was a surprising success in 1948. Produced in Britain (and strictly a British project for all intensive purposes), the film became a runaway hit with most all audiences and critics (becoming the year's Best Picture Oscar winner). Shakespeare's plays have never really warranted excellence on the silver screen, but this adaptation (also by Olivier) is about as close as we have seen thus far. The movie runs nearly three hours and I was about to fall asleep after the first 60 minutes (the film is almost dragging to a crawl by that point), but after the set-up the movie soars very high. Lots of data that is somewhat confusing hogs up a little too much time when the pacing could have been much crisper. Olivier's spin on the timeless classic is truly uncanny nonetheless. His direction (he was Oscar-nominated in the category) and vision are something to behold. The production values are strong and I ended up enjoying the movie for what it is and what it ultimately wanted to be. Olivier became the first of only two people presently to direct himself to an Oscar victory (Roberto Benigni duplicated the feat with 1998's Life Is Beautiful). 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Hamlet must also decide what to do about his mother, Gertrude (Eileen Herlie), who is now married (quite happily, it seems) to Claudius, and Claudius' chief adviser, Polonius (Felix Aymer). In the middle of all this is Hamlet's love Ophelia (Jean Simmons), who is completely confused --- and hurt --- by Hamlet's increasingly bizarre behavior.Like the Zeffrilli/Gibson and Branaugh versions of Shakespeare's classic that followed, Olivier's adaptation is a mostly excellent film with several annoying flaws keeping it just out of reach of greatness.Olivier is superb as Hamlet --- especially when delivering the soliloquies, several of which are genuinely powerful. The rest of the cast, however, is a mixed bag. Herlie is very good, managing to completely overcome that fact that she is really 13 years younger than Olivier. Sydney has his moments and does a decent job, but never really gets across who Claudius really is. Aymer is amusing but nothing more. Simmons makes a good Ophelia, albeit not a great one. Norman Wooland is excellent as Horatio (which is a tough role to actually be memorable in). Stanley Holloway is good as the Gravedigger, but somehow he doesn't nail the part the way Billy Crystal did in the 1996 version. Finally, Peter Cushing is&#133; odd as Osric. The rest of the cast is either stiff or completely uninteresting.However, other than some weak performances, Olivier does a superb job directing everything. The atmosphere during the ghost scenes is absolutely suffocating and starts the film off well. And right from that scene, it's obvious that the camera work is going to be awesome. The camera moves and sweeps everywhere --- but not just for the sake of moving and sweeping like many movies (coughMichaelBaycoughcough). It creates extraordinary images and energy that make many scenes unforgettable --- without calling too much attention to itself.William Walton's creepy music adds a lot.Finally, the climactic fencing scenes are genuinely great &#150; easily the best fencing scenes in a version of Hamlet and possibly among the best in film history.However, despite many great scenes, the movie never creates the emotions it needs to really make the blows come. Yes, some scenes are truly compelling, but on the whole, it misses the mark in that department.However, the scenes that work are brilliant, and despite the lack of emotional power, it is an entertaining and superbly made film that's just as worthwhile as its 90's successors (although it is marginally inferior to them, which is odd --- the 40's version inferior to the 90's remakes!).

Olivier re-edits the script considerably. What appear to be continuity innovations simply fall flat for me. The worst instance of this is the famed to be or not to be speech (most of it delivered in voice-over), which jumps out of nowhere in this version, apropos nothing. Olivier gets away with this butchery on the basis of his roaring egotism (which finally leads to a roaring Hamlet to the end) and the fact that his is one of the most careful directions of the play-as-film to be found on film.Which of course leads me to the positive aspects of the film. Simply as a film, it is brilliantly designed and executed. I've rarely felt a film so successfully blend claustrophobia and depth - this is accomplished through careful juxtapositions of scenes of high-contrast black & white with scenes filled with grey fog; only Hitchcock could have done better (but of course Hitchcock would never have made Hamlet).And although Olivier's performance is really over the top, he wisely makes sure that all the other actors get to come close to that level, especially the actor playing Hamlet's nasty step-dad. So the film vibrates with energy almost from the get-go and all the way to the end.I keep trying to see every film version of Hamlet i can find, to see if the final, absolutely really and truly definitive version of Shakespeare's play (and not Olivier's version of it) might yet be viewed; but until then, this will have to do.

Not that I've seen them all but it's hard to imagine how anything in this production could be much improved upon.The story, admittedly, is kind of dumb. Everybody since Samuel Johnson has been trying to figure out why Hamlet just didn't go ahead and kill Claudius. Ernest Jones psychoanalyzed Hamlet to uncover his hidden motives. But the answer is a simple one. If Hamlet had obeyed his father's ghost, marched down the steps, and killed Claudius on the spot, that would have been the end of the play, as well as the end of Act I or whatever it was. You might as well ask, when the Indians are chasing the stagecoach, why don't they just shoot the horses? But the dialog never goes wrong, even though Olivier has deleted some unnecessary files and defragged the rest. As one lady said after viewing the film, I don't know what's supposed to be so great about it. It's all made up out of old quotations. Some of the old quotations, usually corrupted, have entered the English lexicon without our awareness. Every dog has his day. Neither a borrower nor a lender be. The play's the thing. There's method in his madness. To be or not to be. Alas, poor Yorick. In my mind's eye. The production design in this black and white film is spare. Hardly any superfluous furniture. And it's obviously bound to the studio, and yet it's extremely effective. It has the kind of fog you never see in real life. The last scene, of Hamlet's body being born up the stairway to the tower, takes us on a leisurely tour of previous settings -- the bed chamber, the king's prayer room -- like Welles' camera in the climactic shot of Citizen Kane, moving over the expensive worthless material goods left over from Kane's life.The performances and direction themselves would turn this into a memorable movie. First of all, what a cast! Christopher Lee (Dracula) as a spear carrier. Peter Cushing, another Hammer veteran, as a gay servant. Anthony Quayle. Stanley Holloway (Liza Doolittle's garbageman father in My Fair Lady) as a quick-witted gravedigger. And Olivier himself, brooding and animated by turns, and doing a splendid job of mock fencing, a truly physical presence.It won several Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor. I wonder if it would win anything today. Awards seem to have become hardly more than glitzy settings in which Oscars are given to the biggest pictures that bring in the most money.Well, no sense being too cynical. Let's just say that Olivier's Hamlet is worth about two or three dozen Pearl Harbors and Titanics. If you get a chance to see this, or rent it, don't let the fact that Shakespeare wrote it keep you from watching it. The old guy had a way with words. And, after all, you have incest, five murders and one suicide, and some sneakily bawdy lingo. (Did you think I meant country matters?)

The film, Hamlet, won the academy award for best picture in 1948; suffice it to say, that an accolade such as this merely scratches the surface on the brilliance of this Shakesphearian production!! So many famous quotes of Shakespheare's are from Hamlet Sweets to the sweet The dog will have his day There is something rotten in the state of Denmark Neither a borrower nor a lender be Get thee to a nunnery Sometimes Sister  These are some famous quotes from Hamlet. This literary masterpiece contains a list of world renowned soliloquies as well. Too too this flesh shall melt- And, of course, To be or not to be-, These are some of the quotes and soliloquies. There are so many, I have just rattled off a few!! When an actor or actress takes on a Shakesphearian endeavor, it becomes an acutely sensitizing challenge for them which represents an artistic epitome in their careers!! Shakespheare evokes an absolute height in human creativity, and the succinct polarization of both genders in Hamlet establishes a necessary storyline cohesiveness which is pertinent to all of the main characters in the movie. While a film like Hamlet is viewed as lofty in its disposition, the actuality of Shakespheare's work, is that such an idealism is very disconcerting! More often than not, the esoteric philosophies which are so eloquently manifested from the romanticist characters in Shakespheare's works, are usually vitiated with an emphatic desperation!! These Promethian philosophies are invariably preempted by the visceral components of perseverance. Shakespheare has always had a penchant for his characters to be provoked into agitated responses. Hamlet is an example of such emotions, King Lear and Merchant of Venice are also such examples of these intense displays of rancor!! I have seen this version Hamlet many times. Sir Lawrence Olivier does a remarkable job at directing this film (He also plays the role of Hamlet). Olivier won for best actor in 1948 with this role!! Olivier is a Shakesphearian aficionado who has the ability to carry off a successfully cunning articulation of Hamlet by astutely depicting its fatalistic irony!! The solemn imagery in Hamlet is extremely poignant!! Shakespheare had such a profound prescience with human emotions that he has manufactured an eternal impact on man's conception of what intellectually spellbinding literature should be!! I do like the 1948 performance better than the 1996 version with Glen Close and Mel Gibson,the gripping enmity in the 1948 movie seemed more believable!! The fact that Hamlet won for best picture in 1948 is a very insignificant modicum of this movie's formidable allure!! Such an embodiment of pejorative candor which is illustrated in Hamlet became an enticing attribute to the film in which the movie viewer could easily appreciate!! The myriad of belligerent proclivities demonstrated by the part of Hamlet encompasses a mindset which nurtured an extremely tumultuous cerebral unrest!! This is the principle reason that Olivier's rendition of Hamlet is so incredibly stunning!!The cinematography is sensational in this film, and the acting from virtually everyone with this presentation of Hamlet is paramount!! See this film!! It will elevate your intellectual awareness of Shakespheare, and hopefully, it will also enlighten your perspective of this great masterful work of Shakespheare's which became an academy award winning major motion picture!!

And in the case of Hamlets, we have several to compare. Here we have the celebrated Olivier Hamlet, much celebrated.I see a few very strong elements with some blots, and I suppose these have both become amplified with the passage of 50 years.First, the blots-- Every actor but Olivier is of lesser caliber. I suspect that some of this is what he had to work with, and some apparent clumsiness results from the then standard rendering of the Bard's works as speechifying.-- The women, especially Ophelia are dreadful, absolutely dreadful -- Ophelia's only present because she screwed the boss.-- The score was so heavy, so dated and so hard to ignore it almost made me turn away, regardless of the balancing strengths.-- Hamlet's text presents problems. The best choice in my opinion is to keep it all as Branagh has. But the standard wisdom is that audiences won't sit through 4 hours, no matter how engaging. Then, the question is what to cut. One often keeps the well-known speeches and cuts into the plot about ideas. So here we lose Fortinbras, Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern, together with some rather lovely related language and notions. Too bad because there is a development in the logic of metaphor in the later, longer version of the play, and this is totally lost here.-- Olivier insists on including the notion of Oedipus and Gertrude, absolutely not supported by the text, and only inferred if you don't understand that Hamlet's initial distress is because his succession has been interrupted (not that his access to his Mother has been interrupted).-- Worse, Olivier not only believes Hamlet is a 'man that couldn't make up his mind' but tells us so at the beginning! Does he not get it? Does he not understand the complexities of reason? This is not a play about doubt, but about reasoning.Now the gems-- Even though Olivier gets the character wrong, and has cut some good lines, he has a natural talent for living well in the language. Even though he's coming from the wrong place, and overly postures, his rendering of the lines comes from a rare genius. Worth experiencing, despite the surrounding distractions.-- The costumes are too lush for my tastes, but they fit the set. And my, what a set it is. Except for the cheesy painted sky, this castle is pretty wonderful lots of colonnaded corridors, mezzanines, stairs, aligned archways. Olivier may be trying to top archrival Orson Wells, but I think he has done very well in using the building to frame the action in a way that is fully cinematic, transcending the stage. The only effect that jarred was the thrice-done long pullback when Claudius conspires with Laertes.--The film is in Black and White. Olivier had no choice of course, but it is a happy accident. Allows the photography to be more artistic, better lit, more abstract, just as the mood of the play would have it.Bottom line This is worth seeing to discuss, but the Branagh version is more true and has many fewer distracting blots.

In the late 40s and early 50s, the era of film noir, the most prominent Shakespearean films were the tragedies &#150; Macbeth (1948) and Othello (1952) by Orson Welles, and Julius Caesar (1953) by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and this version of Hamlet, perhaps the darkest of them all, by the man who made Shakespeare cinematic, Laurence Olivier.Despite being centuries old, the plot of Hamlet sounds like the archetypal film noir &#150; treachery, revenge, ironic tragedy, ambiguous morality and most importantly of all a central character who repeatedly suffers through his own lack of willpower, and for whom there is no hope of a happy ending. The lines of Shakespeare's play were themselves to inspire a few noir screenwriters. Most notably, Leave her to heaven is both a line spoken by the king's ghost in reference to the queen and the title of a noir made in 1946. Also, the king's final plea to remember me are echoed by the last words of Cloris Leachman in Kiss Me Deadly &#150; probably a deliberate reference by writer Mickey Spillane. However Olivier in return borrows the style of film noir for this extremely bleak and psychological adaptation. He places great emphasis on Hamlet's indecisiveness and inner turmoil. The cinematography is also in the noir fashion of the day &#150; in fact this has to be literally one of the blackest films ever made, the only light coming through pinpricks in vast swathes of black.As well as noir, Olivier borrows stylistically from the horror genre. The scenes in which the king's ghost appear are exceptionally eerie. Throughout there is an atmosphere of quiet unease, which occasionally give way to bursts of hysteria &#150; such as when the king breaks down during the player's performance shouting get me some light! The style here is reminiscent of Powell and Pressburgers' Black Narcissus (1947), which itself was notable for being a drama played like a horror. This touch was itself influential on later Shakespeare adaptations &#150; Welles' Othello and Kurosawa's Throne of Blood (based on Macbeth) both contain elements of horror.Olivier's Hamlet is also a product of 1940s British cinema, when Powell and Pressburger's creed of total cinema reined supreme. With Henry V in 1944 Olivier had shown how Shakespeare could be shorn of staginess without watering down the quality of the original material. Here again he uses contemporary technique and his own individual style to show the story in a cinematic form. A notable example are Hamlet's soliloquies, spoken by voice over to show them for what they are supposed to be &#150; an internal monologue. He even has the odd line or two spoken allowed, and yet within a month! to give it added weight. Olivier's use of space is exceptional &#150; his camera prowls around a labyrinthine castle set with such a bizarre geometry it's almost like being inside an MC Escher drawing. Often, what with the lighting, the walls of each room disappear completely, making the spaces seam even more cavernous and isolating.As he did with his Henry V, Olivier blends a commanding stage-like performance with moments of more cinematic restraint. He is hypnotic here &#150; surely no stage Hamlet ever looked quite so much like a man out of his mind. The rest of the cast is fantastic &#150; it reads like a who's who of great British film stars of the day. One notable omission is Ralph Richardson, though he would get his moment in Olivier's Richard III (1955).Aside from its quality and influence, Hamlet made history at the Oscars. It was the first non-US feature to win Best Picture, the first time a Best Actor winner had directed themselves, as well as being the first and to date only Shakespeare adaptation to win Best Picture. In spite of all this it tends to be somewhat overlooked today. Olivier's three Shakespeare adaptations are leaders in the field and deserve more attention.

One of the basic reasons for this is the fact that its themes make adaptation somewhat controversial a major theme of Hamlet is indecisiveness and ambiguity, which makes fleshing it out for any stage or screen a struggle for its adapter. Laurence Olivier was not very happy with this adaptation, nor were many critics at the time.But how does this movie stand out? For one thing, Olivier has enough sense of the rhythms and dialog of Shakespeare to make it's more archaic delivery mostly seamless and logical. Secondly, he uses the set-design to emphasize isolation of the castle and claustrophobia of the characters in order to remove the staginess, or at least expectation for staginess, in the film. And thirdly, his camera roves around at a subjective level, sometimes literally detaching from the action to focus on empty sets in order to create a Phantasmagoria in the film. These three devices flow together to create drama that manages well to keep focused and emotionally compelling. Most importantly, the adaptation is quite logical.Unfortunately, even though I've read Hamlet I'm by no means a Shakespeare scholar and I do not remember every detail it as I understand, Olivier made some pretty controversial cuts in the script, especially two of Hamlet's soliloquys. It's understandable. At it's extant length, Olivier's Hamlet stays just within it's welcome, and the two soliloquys that he does keep show his difficulty in figuring out just exactly how he wanted to present them.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"Dark but definitive","Date":"28 June 2004","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I have heard many people's opinions on how they think that compared to Kenneth Brannagh's Hamlet Olivier's is too brooding, quiet and humourless.

I would like to now give the non-biased comparisons between Olivier and Brannagh's Hamlet.    Olivier's silences hold you captivated.    Brannagh's silences do not, because he never stops talking.        Olivier's words are poignantly spoken and beautifully placed.    Brannagh's words are spoken sometimes indifferently, and other times with so much gusto its overacting.    Olivier's gestures and body movements are stunning and unique to him.    Brannagh does nothing but sit or stand half the time.   Olivier's Ophelia was the beautiful and wonderful actress Jean Simmons.    I don't know who Brannagh's Ophelia was, but she wasn't a patch on Jean Simmons.   So there you are. I could give you more, but I think if I want to diss Branagh further I'll return to the board. Don't get me wrong, I think Brannagh's fantastic, the best actor around at the moment; but occasionlly people fail to distinguish talent from sheer mastery.

The miracle I hope for is that the play in its fullness could be intelligibly pitched to a modern sensibility - or else that the production style could elucidate an earlier sensibility.   In this version, the  flowery Renaissance sensibility that pervades the lovely poignant scene of the death of Ophelia seems replaced by half-hearted Freudianism and a dated concept of medieval style where austerity and floridness jarringly conflict.I would be grateful if one production could make clear to me why Hamlet feigns madness.

The play performed on Stage and later adapted to the Silver Screen, is highlighted as the supreme accomplishment of the writer. First performed in 1948 by the late great Lawrence Olivier is of such magnitude, it later received Monumental honors as to mark him as the greatest Shakespearean of the era. The gist of the story is of a lonely depressed Danish prince named Hamlet (Lawrence Olivier) who is sorely troubled by the untimely death of his father and the otherwise hasty remarriage of his mother. So troubled is he that he along with other friends, begin to experiencing ghostly apparitions of his late father. Convinced that his father's death was no accident, Hamlet sets about to avenge his father's death which results in a the accidental death of Polonius, chief counselor to the king. From there on, everyone assumes that Hamlet has gone complete mad, further resulting in his banishment to England and the death of Ophelia (Jean Simmons). The movie was filmed in Black and White to the wishes of the director and star of the film. To date few actors have garnished as many accolades as has Olivier. Although the film is listed a bit long, it was indeed originally longer until edited by Olivier. Many actors got their beginning in this movie. Among them are the following. Anthony Quayle, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Any collection of great films is not complete without this movie.

The film is incredibly well made for starters with moody lighting, very interesting and well thought out camera angles and sumptuous costumes and settings. The music is resolutely haunting which suits the complex tone of the play and film more than very well. The writing is outstanding though if I have any criticisms I also agree the soliloquies don't quite work out as they could. Olivier's direction is hard to fault and he is brilliant in the title role. He gets strong performances from a fine cast the best being Norman Wooland's Horatio and Jean Simmons' Orphelia. Basil Sidney's Claudius is also very good, but I marginally prefer Jacobi in the role.

Olivier's Hamlet on stage, of course, was very famous and modeled after John Barrymore's portrayal. Not as athletic as Gielgud's portrayal, Olivier's Shakespeare work was notable for the fact that he didn't sing the text, but rather said it realistically. For his film version of Richard III, he deliberately made the setting look false, making the point that, if you gave the audience a realistic-looking setting, they would then ask, Why are these people talking so funny? Similarly, for Hamlet, the castle is a stark, huge affair, standing in the midst of fog, and unusual camera angles are used to make some stunning shots.The text of the play is heavily cut, and two characters, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are indeed dead - they don't exist here. The cast is good - it can't compare with Olivier's Richard III cast seven years later - but it's Olivier's show, and he's tremendous, giving a thrilling performance.As many times as I've seen Hamlet, I'm always impressed at how many famous phrases have come out of it.

As a seventeen year old, I just haven't been exposed to them all and subsequent filmic adaptations just yet. I have read 'Hamlet' though, and I must say Laurence Olivier's cinematic version is very, very good.Olivier sustains my interest in Shakespeare like no other actor. He could speak the language of the Bard so naturally that it seems like his normal way of speech, and he had great understanding of Shakespeare's key themes and messages. Here, Olivier gives a stunning acting and directing performance as the melancholy Dane. Olivier was in his early forties when this was released (he dyed his hair blonde for the role), but he has the vitality of a twenty year old when dueling. Olivier's version is heavily tinged with the Freudian brush, reflecting the growing trend towards psychoanalytic theory in the 1940's.Lovely young Jean Simmons (only a sweet nineteen year old) equips herself very well against the masterful Olivier. Playing Hamlet's love Ophelia, Simmons proved she was not just a pretty face. Great support provided from most of the players, with Stanley Holloway's grave digger giving the production a nice comedic touch. But it is Olivier that dominates the film in his Academy-Award winning role. He plays Hamlet as 'a man who cannot make up his mind' (this is provided in a nifty voice-over narration at the beginning) with many complexities and underlying emotional problems. A difficult character to portray, but Olivier comes up trumps in his version. Of course, the stage-actor Olivier was prone to over-acting and a tendency to be theatrically limited on film, but Hamlet suits this approach.The use of shadowy black and white cinematography evokes the Dane's moodiness perfectly; Olivier's direction was a key factor in the film's success. The famous 'to be or not to be' soliloquy is handled wonderfully, as are the climatic final scenes. Throughout the film we are treated to a variety of nice cinematic touches by Olivier. Of particular note are the long, lingering shots of Elsinore and the tracking shots of Prince Hamlet as he paces the confines of his castle, torn between feelings of revenge, repulsion and love.As with almost all filmic adaptations of classic literature, cuts have had to be made from the original work. A big omission is that of Rosencrantz and Guilderstern. As the film already runs for over two hours, cutting was necessary in order to keep the pace flowing. This is already a rather slow-moving adaptation, so Olivier made a conscious decision to omit these two.One of the best Shakespearean adaptations you'll ever see.9/10.

At its worst, this film can be viewed as Hamlet's Greatest Hits, but I think Olivier chose his cuts well, and he ends up with a fairly powerful condensed version of the story.Of course, as an elitist ex-English major, I prefer Branagh's comprehensive four-hour version. But Olivier's rendition is still worth watching. This film has an eerie, shadowy atmosphere, and some impressive (if artificial) sets. The manifestations of the ghost are downright creepy, the sword-fights are exciting, and the camera-work is fluid and unusual. In short, this is a nice production.The casting is strong, too. Olivier makes an intense (but rather too old) Hamlet, and Jean Simmons is sympathetic as Ophelia. I didn't recognize the actors playing Claudius and Gertrude, but I enjoyed their performances as well. Even the great horror actor Peter Cushing makes an appearance, acquitting himself well in the role of Osric, the rather bizarre court fop.On the downside, this movie is occasionally a little too dark and brooding for its own good. Sometimes it drags under its own weight, and sometimes it feels pretentious. Interestingly, Branagh avoided slowness in his Hamlet by actually making the setting bright and attractive; in his adaptation, the real darkness was in the characters themselves, not their environment.Still, Olivier's film is solid work, and well-deserving of its recognition at the Oscars. It's certainly one of the best literary adaptations of the period.

His interpretation of Hamlet is as close to what Shakespeare could have wanted.  There is no reason to suspect an Oedipus Complex, no reason to include Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, no reason to make the film four hours long, and it is entirely incorrect to call Hamlet a strong character.  He is not strong, nor heroic.  In both the play and the film, Hamlet reacts after thoroughly thinking everything through.  But, come the end of the play, he has thought incorrectly.  All of the deaths in the play are at Hamlet's hands.  He neglects Ophelia becasue he doesn't know how to approach her, he can't decide whether or not he should tell Laeretes about Claudius, and he never truly understands why the ghost appeared to him.

Not movie stars, but actors. Among them are Marlon Brando, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, and Sir Laurence Olivier. Having already some familiarity with the works of William Shakespeare (by no means, am I an expert, but I know some things), I judged it was time to see how Olivier himself treated one of the Bard's most famous works.Well, the first impression I got from watching this movie is that it is quite obviously a labor of love. Olivier was an avid practitioner of Shakespeare, and this movie is his tribute. And, one thing I can say about this version of Hamlet is that it appears to be a more faithful interpretation, rather than an adaptation with whole scenes taken out for the sake of time, continuity, and/or to keep the audience's attention. While ambitious, the results are mixed.First, let's cover what I did like about the movie. On the top of that list is Jean Simmons as Ophelia. Her performance was nearly flawless as Hamlet's girlfriend, who loses her mind after her father's death. Another surprise I spotted was character actor Stanley Holloway (Liza's father in My Fair Lady) as the gravedigger in the Alas, poor Yorick scene. And the swordfight finale was well choreographed.Now, for what I felt was lacking. Many of the actors in this movie (particularly Basil Sydney, who played King Claudius) appeared wooden. Even Olivier himself looked like he had succumbed to mediocre performance at times. A lot of the lines sounded like they were phoned in, and Polonius (Felix Aylmer) sounded too much like he was dispassionately reading from Poor Richard's Almanac while dispensing his wisdom to his children, Ophelia and Laertes (Terence Morgan).As Hamlet himself said, The play's the thing, but this is a play put on film. With that, there is an inherent problem with its presentation Sometimes, it doesn't translate well. While I am sure that on stage, this was phenomenal, on screen it is hit-and-miss. But, like I said, it was a labor of love, and it does mark two firsts in Oscar history The first movie directed by its star, and the first independent film, to win Best Picture.For purists and those who study Shakespeare, this presentation is the one to watch. It's a no-frills, camera-eye view of the play utilizing a single set. But this is not just another movie to watch for the sake of watching it. It has been said that true art has flaws, and by that very definition, Olivier's Hamlet is art, warts and all.

Olivier and text editor Alan Dent cut the script to the bone, eliminating not only the character of Fortinbras (who is a common casualty of the editor's pen), but Rosencrantz and Guildestern (who are indispensable to depicting a complete version of the story).Most of the acting is forgettable, with only Academy Award nominated Jean Simmons making any impact as the tragic Ophelia. Olivier is frankly wooden in the role (his 1937 stage performance was universally panned), making one realize that Hamlet was never really his part and that posterity would have been better served if he's left this play alone and instead filmed one of his stage successes such as Macbeth or Titus Andronicus.Olivier's success comes as a director rather than an actor, depicting Elsinore as a gloomy and forbidding haunted castle. The drum representing the ghost's heartbeat is a masterfully effective device and the look of the film can only be described as wonderfully Shakespearean.While the virtues of the film are spotty, one scene must surely be ranked as among the greatest ever committed to celluloid the duel between Hamlet and Laertes in Act V. It is hard to imagine any other production (stage or film) competing the excitement or tension of this compelling action, and Olivier's celebrated leap from a high tower to finally do away with Claudius is worthy of every platitude it has received. (Compare this to the ludicrous display of Kenneth Branagh throwing a magic rapier from across the palace to hit a super hero's bulls-eye into Claudius' heart in the vulgar and miscast 1996 film and you'll see what I mean.) Olivier's Hamlet was an important milestone in it's day, but is badly dated and does not stand up well to more recent productions such as Derek Jacobi's 1978 BBC production with the pre-Star Trek Patrick Stewart as a magnificent Claudius (in my mind the definitive screen Hamlet) or the filmed record of the John Gielgud/Richard Burton 1964 Broadway production (which is truer to the play's theatrical roots). Olivier's film is indeed a classic, but it brings to mind Mark Twain's definition of the word a book that someone praises but doesn't read.

Maybe the most-quoted English piece of all time, Hamlet is a delicate piece that needs to be done right. In his 1948, black and white, Best Picture-winning Hamlet, Olivier delivered an adaptation that hung close to the letter and spirit of the original source, but didn't dare to fly free. It certainly grasped the mood Shakespeare wanted, but it doesn't take filming freedoms where the text allowed. Certainly, he achieved the most freedom from the stage through the cinematography, most noticeably the unique camera movements imitating the sound of a heartbeat that plays when the dead king's ghost is observed in anyway in the story.Hamlet feels more like a filmed version of the play rather than an adaptation. But at that, it is amazing. The dark presence and tragic undertones grow through Olivier's Oscar-winning lead performance and Jean Simmons's crazed Ophelia. As the narrator states in the beginning of film, This is the tragedy of a man who could not make up his mind. In the play and film, Hamlet is visited by his father's (the former king of Denmark) ghost, stating that his uncle, now the king, had murdered him. However, Hamlet is unsure what action to follow, for if he murders his uncle, it would be repaying evil with evil. Unfortunately, a mistake causes Hamlet to be exiled to England, but he doesn't give up there, and the story builds up to a climatic ending.Like the play itself, Hamlet offers many questions but doesn't give any straightforward answers. The questions dive deep, and along with Shakespeare's old English, younger viewers might not understand. As with the play, an undercurrent topic of incest plays out, mostly through Hamlet's complaints against his uncle taking his father's widow as his wife. Furthermore, the ending is dramatic and sad &#x96; with a lot of dead people.Olivier, who has the skill to drop any obscure line of Shakespeare in a beat, manages to work a scarcely worthy adaptation of the play, despite having to cut many monologues and soliloquies in order to run under 160 minutes. One of the weak points of the film is Olivier's recitation of the famous soliloquy, To be or not to be. To my disappointment, Olivier rushes through it with melancholy and something short of fake that it doesn't have much dramatic and emotional impact. The play did not have any rule or details that restricted it from emotional freedom, especially as a film. Olivier seems to restrict himself to rules that Shakespeare didn't put or intend. But otherwise, Olivier's Hamlet is extraordinary in its own right. He portrays it in the way Shakespeare might have imagined it &#x96; the non-extravagant set pieces, simply choreographed and bloodless duels, and few, select locations for different scenes. For the sources and educational material, Olivier's Hamlet is worth watching, but only for the artistic value of the spirit and letter of Shakespeare.

The latter focuses on the horrific actions to which greed drives people, much like how Hamlet looks at vindictiveness. Neither offers a rosy view of humanity.The cold, Gothic sets frame the story perfectly. Elsinore's dreary look does as much to emphasize the characters' futile existence as any of the actors do. I should note that I've never seen a stage production of Hamlet, so I'm not the best person to offer a comparison to a live version. I understand that Olivier cut much of the story to condense the movie so that he could emphasize the psychological aspect. Even so, he turned out a masterpiece, becoming the first person to direct himself to an acting Oscar, and giving us the first Best Picture winner not from the US.

It is also the first sound film of the play in English. That seems pretty hard to believe, but it is true. Stranger still, the first sound version was actually in Urdu.Olivier excised the political elements of the play (entirely cutting Fortinbras, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) in favor of an intensely psychological performance, partly to save time. Olivier himself stated that one great whacking cut had to be made, and the cut he chose to make was the omission of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. This was not much criticized at first, but later critics did take more notice of it, especially after shorter productions of Hamlet that did not leave out these characters were presented on television.Olivier also played up the Oedipal overtones of the play by having Hamlet kiss his mother lovingly on the lips several times during the film. Film scholar Jack Jorgens has commented that Hamlet's scenes with the Queen in her low-cut gowns are virtually love scenes. In contrast, Jean Simmons' Ophelia is destroyed by Hamlet's treatment of her in the nunnery scene.Changes or not, this is the Hamlet that all others should be compared to.

It's been quite some time since I've read it or seen it performed but I would guess that Olivier cut a good third, if not more, of the play for this film version. Most significantly, he entirely cut out the major characters of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and Fortinbras as well as quite a few minor ones. In spite of this, however, the story retains its general thrust - if not all the specifics - and the film is still magnificent as Olivier once again utterly excels as both an actor and a director. This was the first British or non-American film to win the Best Picture Actor and Olivier became the first actor to win the Best Actor Oscar for a film that he directed himself. The only other person to accomplish this feat was Roberto Benigni in La vita è bella 49 years later. Although Olivier was nominated for twelve Oscars (nine for Best Actor, one for Best Supporting Actor and two for Best Picture), this film was the only one for which he won any Academy Award.As the melancholy Dane, Olivier is absolutely wonderful. While the cuts to Henry V meant that the title character was shown in a very positive light, he did not hesitate - as either actor or director - here to emphasise his character's less desirable qualities such as his egotistical behaviour and his utter callousness when it comes to unintentionally killing Polonius. And yet Olivier's performance also draws attention to the character's psychological vulnerability after the murder of his father, thus eliciting sympathy. His lust for revenge has cut him off from his emotions, something which is also seen in his brutal rejection of Ophelia. Olivier also plays the ghost of Hamlet's father in the film and does a fantastic job in that role too.Speaking of Ophelia, the 18-year-old Jean Simmons is excellent, playing the role with a remarkable level of subtlety for someone of her age and comparatively limited acting experience. In spite of playing Hamlet's mother Gertrude, Eileen Herlie was almost eleven years younger than Olivier. While she unsurprisingly looks much younger than him, her very strong performance and great voice meant that I forgot this rather odd age gap existed almost as soon as she opened her mouth. Felix Aylmer, who played the Archbishop of Canterbury in Henry V, has a far larger role in this film as Polonius and was certainly up to the task. He's just fantastic. Basil Sydney isn't as strong as I would have liked as Claudius but he is still very good. However, I don't think that there is anyone in the film who gives a bad performance. Olivier had such a great eye for casting that it's a shame that he directed a mere five films. I wish that an artist - not usually a word that I use when referring to actors - of his calibre had been more prolific behind the camera. Aside from those actors that I have already mentioned, I would like to single out Esmond Knight (who unfortunately has a far smaller role than in Henry V), John Laurie, Terence Morgan, Anthony Quayle and Stanley Holloway. In his first British film, Peter Cushing - one of my favourite actors who, like Olivier, played Van Helsing years later - is good in the small supporting role of the foppish Osric but his performance isn't on the same level as most of his later ones. I have to say that I have never paid so much attention to the extras in a film as in this one! This is because three actors who became very well known in later years made uncredited appearances in the film Christopher Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Patrick Macnee. In only his third film, Lee makes two blink and you'll miss them appearances just before the duel between Hamlet and Laertes. In the first instance, he appears behind his future best friend and frequent on screen nemesis Peter Cushing in what was their first of 24 films together. Llewelyn was far easier to spot as he appears quite prominently in the background of several scenes. He actually has slightly more screen time than the credited Patrick Troughton, who portrays the small but pivotal role of the Player King but doesn't have any lines. While I was on a constant lookout for Lee and Macnee (the film's only two surviving cast members), I didn't manage to spot the future John Steed. Acting aside, the film looks fantastic. In contrast to the vibrant Technicolor of Henry V, the film was shot in black and white. Apparently, this was done more for financial than artistic reasons but the black and white cinematography adds to the sense of foreboding. The use of deep focus - probably inspired by Citizen Kane - is superlative. As with Orson Welles, Olivier demonstrated that he was a master of not one but two crafts in a single film. Incidentally, Olivier had hoped to make Macbeth after Henry V but the fact that Welles was working on his own version put paid to that idea. Macbeth has always been my favourite Shakespearean play so the fact that Olivier never got to make his version of it for the big screen is hugely disappointing, particularly since it was considered one of his best roles - and that's really saying something - and it would have starred his then wife Vivien Leigh as Lady Macbeth.Overall, the film is a masterpiece in spite of the fact that it cuts significant portions of the play. One of my Top 30 to 35 films of all time. "},{"Title":"one of best movies ever made","Date":"12 September 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This is a great movie. It is a true classic.

Subplots, characters, and lines are eliminated, to the point where it feels unfinished. Olivier did this for two reasons time and more focus on Hamlet. Hamlet is Shakespeare's most complex and debated character, so Olivier condensing the movie isn't that bad. It also allows the movie more of a dark, Gothic feeling, much to Hamlet's self. But Olivier cutting out many lines, including all but the last line in the O what a rogue and peasant slave am I soliloquy arguably the best soliloquy in the play, is what I didn't like. It is the most intense we see him, and it is also when he shows his main traits sadness, anger, confusion, philosophy, wit, happiness and determination, all in the same part. It is also the play's turning point/climax (all of Shakespeare's climax's happen near the middle). Olivier including that soliloquy would has added just a couple more minutes and would have made Olivier's great performance even better. Though I have been bickering at the condensation, that is not enough to say this movie wasn't good or sucked. What makes this so good is the filming and portrayals. Sir Laurence Olivier was the greatest actor of the 20th century. Some similar actors in his time such as Gielgud, Guinness and Richardson became his greatest rivals, but none could surpass him. But on film, Olivier did crappy performances by being completely unconvincing and very robotic. This is one of those times where he would deliver a superb powerhouse performance. Plus, the delivery of the character was very plausible. Hamlet is a character that only the best can play. To do a good Hamlet, one must have strong acting and accuracy. Not just one or the other, or one outweighing the other. There is no correct way of playing Hamlet, only accuracy. The only way to attain that accuracy is by showing every kind of human emotion, all while keeping a basis for the general character (Olivier's was a man who could not make up his mind, which is the most popular and plausible generalization). Olivier's accuracy may very well be how Shakespeare intended on writing Hamlet. His strong accuracy and dazzling performance makes this one of the best portrayals in film history. If you have not studied Hamlet, you won't think so. Other than Olivier, everyone else's portrayals and accuracy were spot on too. Even Gertrude (who was noticeably 10 years younger than Oliver) was great. Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version disgraced all characters except for Horatio. What makes this a great piece of film are the camera tricks and special effects. Although Olivier did not like doing movies, he admired filmmakers and wanted to do an artful movie. For a movie in the 1940s, the ghost, smokes, and lighting were uncanny. His capturing of a dark Gothic feeling is so good and fits the play very well. He also incorporates many camera tricks that adding meaning and pull the viewer in. This is the only artful and skillfully crafted film about a Shakespearean play.

Director\star Laurence Olivier completely edited out the R&G boys (not to mention Fortinbras) from his variation of Shakespeare's play, to give himself more time on-screen. Olivier's HAMLET becomes a pirate fighter (like Captain Bligh); an international hostage (like Richard the Lionheart); a champion fencer (like Errol Flynn), and a take-down tackling avenger from on high (like Spiderman). No doubt Larry thought he was entitled to take any liberties with this story he fancied, conflating himself with the title character, since he'd had his own private version of mad Ophelia (wife Vivien Leigh). Religious faith, on the other hand, is Hamlet Junior's undoing, as he refrains from killing serial poisoner King Claudius in the castle chapel because the latter is mumbling a combination prayer\regicide\incest confession for doing in Hamlet Senior in order to mount the throne and Queen Gertrude himself. Junior abstains from the revenge mandated by Senior's Ghost (who sounds a lot like Laurence Olivier, too) since the younger Hamlet fears this would send the ruthless killer straight to Heaven!! At least Hamlet made up his mind in recommending a nunnery (as mental institutions were referred to back then) for Ophelia. Alas, she drowned herself and got buried in the unhallowed grave of Yorick, a long-dead court jester (Olivier does not repeat the Pope joke that put Yorick into unholy ground 23 years earlier). Though Hamlet offers to eat a crocodile with Ophelia's peeved brother, Laertes, the latter stabs him in the back. After everyone dies, the rest is alleged to be silence by Olivier (though he apparently forgot to mention that to the Motion Picture Academy Oscar voters).

This decision gives the movie a somewhat unreal feeling. It's hard to know where you are in Elsinore castle, or what will await you when you turn the next corner. The film has a surreal, ethereal quality. You don't feel you're in a real castle in a real kingdom. This Hamlet has a dream-like sense to it.Olivier the director concentrates on Olivier the actor. If there was ever a Hamlet's Hamlet, this is it. Sir Laurence must have done something right, because Olivier the actor received an Oscar for his performance. (This was the first of only two movies in which a director directed himself to his own Oscar-winning best actor performance.)Olivier was 41 when he played Hamlet, but he got past this hurdle with his incredible talent, his acting experience, and his lithe, athletic grace. (Eileen Hurlie, who played Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, was only 30 in 1948). The supporting cast is solid. The talented actor Jean Simmons, who played Ophelia as only 19, but nevertheless was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. However, she played the part with heavy stage makeup and a blond wig, and appeared to me to be miscast in the role.Hamlet is Shakespeare's longest play. Most directors don't want a four-hour Hamlet, although Kenneth Branagh took this option. Olivier opted for a 155-minute version, so, obviously, the play has been abridged. I think the choices of what scenes to omit was done well, and the movie is definitely recognizable as Shakespeare's Hamlet.We saw the film on a classroom-sized screen, where it worked well. It would do even better in a theater, but will also work on DVD. I don't consider this the best Hamlet I've seen, even though it won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1948. Although Olivier's Hamlet won't be to everyone's taste, it's an essential movie for anyone even moderately interested in film adaptations of Shakespeare's greatest play.

My classmates laughed at several of Olivier's dramatics, Jean Simmons' overdone Ophelia, and the ghost which they considered campy. They came to the conclusion that the film was badly dated and, as one girl put it, Laurence Olivier couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. That statement's a bit ridiculous and my classmates showed a great deal of immaturity, but I will say even I was disappointed with this version of Hamlet.It's a good movie no doubt about that Olivier was right to shoot the film in black-and-white as it adds to the foreboding atmosphere. The sets are minimalist, which might come across as stagey to some but I think it added to the mood. The transitions are remarkable tracking shoots that go through the shadowy labyrinth that is Elsinore Castle, reflecting Hamlet's indecisive state of mind. The overall feel reminded me of a German expressionist film from the 1920s, and I enjoyed that very much.As far as adaptations go, this one slims down the text significantly. Most notably, the political aspect of the play is eradicated, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern make no appearance. The whole movie runs two and a half hours. I honestly had no problem with how the play was adapted. Olivier still covers the major themes of the original, so a few subplots getting cut did not offend me too much.Olivier's interpretation of the title character did not impress. His Hamlet is much too inactive. No one denies that Hamlet is an introspective fellow, but Olivier seems to have forgotten he is an impulsive man as well. Poor Jean Simmons is miscast as Ophelia and gives the weakest portrayal in the film. She obviously had no clue what she was doing. Honestly, Olivier would have been better off casting his wife Vivien Leigh, an amazing actress who had much experience dealing with Shakespeare. Everyone else does fine in their parts, though no one really stands out.This film's influence cannot be denied and despite all my criticism, this is worth seeing. The cinematography and atmosphere are stunning (these two elements are what make the film for me), but I cannot say this is the definitive Hamlet.

Not only do many readers get confused with the Old English, paranoid with the mythological references and cryptic metaphors and at times, tired with the flowery style, but also get bogged down by the lack of sympathy with the characters. I feel that Shakespeare is not one of my favorite writers, even though I do admire his Midsummer Night's Dream, Hamlet and The Tempest. I would rather read the Oedipus trilogy by Sophocles because there is an imminent tension in the play. Shakespeare relies more on grand and sometimes arcane soliloquies &#x96; there is so much he is telling but he deliberately wraps it so that interpretations may differ. I revere this quality, it makes him a genius and gives great pleasure to analyze his play but to read his plays for leisure is something I wouldn't really be interested.I read Hamlet first when I was 16; it was a magnum opus but I couldn't grasp its immense power. On viewing this film after almost 3 years, I noticed one thing about the play. The character of Hamlet is purposely given less characterization so that the reader/the actor may interpret him in his own way. In Oedipus the King, one can get a clear picture of Oedipus' torment not only by his dialogs but also by the singular focus of the play. Hamlet, however leaves up to the readers to decide how Hamlet really is or can be. Therefore, he is given such monologues and scenes that reveal the physical and part psychological element of the play but not in entirety. Even now, a writer/director can twist Hamlet's tale by putting in new conditions &#x96; that's one special virtue of the play.I still am puzzled about the ghost in the play. How is it that the guards, Horatio and Hamlet are able to see it while Gertrude cannot? This is the apparition of Hamlet's dead father, who wanders the castle at night and vanishes with the crowing of the cock. Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark mourns his father's untimely demise and scorns his mother's incestuous marriage with his uncle. After an encounter with the spirit who informs Hamlet about Claudio, his uncle's spineless deed, the prince feigns madness to extract vengeance.Acting wise, Laurence Olivier gives the most unaffected performance that works most of the times, except when Hamlet has to feign madness. Olivier seemed too calm to look or sound mad. Eileen Herlie is very convincing as Hamlet's mother, generating the right passion and perplexity for her character. Her scene with Hamlet in her room is very well acted by both the actors. Basil Sydney as Claudius was good but his character's motives remained unclear on a deeper level. Jean Simmons played her part well, but again, I didn't care much for her Ophelia. Here is where I am confused whether the actors are not truly reaching the depth of their characters or am I not yet floored by Shakespeare? Terence Morgan was the bad apple here.The film has a theatrical feel throughout; I could see many stage techniques applied, especially 'emphasis'. But Olivier brings a great camera technique during the ghost encounters where the sound of drum beat / heart beat is heard and the camera zooms in menacingly. But I was unimpressed with a few aspects in the film. For example, the somewhat forgettable 'Be not too tame but let your discretion&#x85;.' soliloquy. The scene with the actors where Claudius guiltily storms off was rushed and should have been shot in an elaborate, more Hitchcockian style. And the man who cannot make up his mind is vague. On a positive note, the scenes between Hamlet and ghost, Hamlet and mother and Ophelia, and the final scenes are shot and acted very well. The best part is that the play is much easier to understand and the script has been well adapted here.Most people consider To be or Not to be to be the definitive quote.

"},{"Title":"Hamlet As Action Hero","Date":"22 January 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" As Hamlet's lead actor, Laurence Olivier grabs every scene by the throat to hold your attention, even at the risk of making for a hammy Dane. As director/script editor, he pares the Bard's longest play to its essentials, and sometimes less, to develop the kind of through line effective cinema demands.This is the tragedy...of a man who could not...make up...his mind, Olivier intones at the start in a voice-over narration. It's not Shakespeare's line, but Olivier's, rather reductivist and intrusive. Yet this simplification works, too. We are not troubled here by the elemental madness question that plagues Hamlet on stage, or his existentialist ennui. This is a man on a mission to avenge his father's death. He knows what he has to do; it is only up to him to act on it.A flawed thesis, probably, when measured against the source play, but Olivier uses it to tremendous effect. There's something rotten in the state of Denmark, we learn early on, and the film works with deep-focused precision at developing the idea of corruption in the highest court of the land.Fog rises over half-ruined battlements while jumpy sentries shout challenges at one another. Desmond Dickinson's camera-work contains many deep-focus shots with long pans and pull-backs to emphasize the labyrinthine set. A sly counselor, Polonius (Felix Aylmer), shamelessly uses his daughter Ophelia to further his own career. I swear I use no art at all, he tells Hamlet, artfully.I don't mind Olivier's liberties with the text; some seem improvements. Having Hamlet deliver his famous to-be-or-not-to-be soliloquy in the middle of his farewell scene with ill-fated Ophelia (Jean Simmons) doesn't work on stage for me and really wouldn't have worked on screen. I also find the subplot about invading Norway superfluous, and that many of the speeches could use trimming.Nice star turns abound in this film, from Aylmer and a marvelously discombobulated Simmons to walk-on roles for Stanley Holloway (First Gravedigger) and Anthony Quayle (Marcellus). Peter Cushing has a nicely split role of a comic fop who, like so many of the players in this production, has a sinister hidden agenda.As actor, Olivier luxuriates in long pauses and sidelong glances. As director, he is a near polar opposite, creating a fruitful tension at Hamlet's core. This has the feel of a proto-Bergman film in many ways, gray and foreboding and set in Scandinavia, but tight close-ups on faces are few and short-lived. In many ways, the many long pans do double duty; creating mood while delivering wordless exposition regarding King Claudius's misrule, or Hamlet's painful separation from Ophelia.I'm not so in love with this Hamlet; there's much overstepping of the modesty of nature in Olivier's acting though he nails many small moments with wonderfully offhanded grace. The final act drags on longer than it should, given the economy with which the rest of the play is rendered.But there's something thrilling in this man-of-action version of Hamlet. Olivier's so much fun on screen, and so clever behind it, that you never tire of his company however fulsome it becomes. It's not the Bard's Hamlet, but it's lively and adventurous and reminds you how rich the world of Shakespeare can be when you can take such fruitful detours within it.

All the famous quotes including To be or not to be and The play's the thing are the key moments and stand out come the end of the film, which takes a while to come.Olivier gets every element in apart from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, which he received criticism for. Though brilliant, this is an exceptionally long and drawn out film, which may test your patience.There are a few lapses but ultimately this is one of Shakespeare's finest adaptations and helped me a lot when studying for my English A level. Finely acted and superbly directed, Olivier has created a landmark in the drama genre and is one of the finest adaptations of all time.

There is an irony, however, which connects this project to Orson Welles that I find quite interesting. Firstly, Hamlet aptly utilizes many of the camera innovations that Welles used to revolutionize cinema with Citizen Kane. Secondly, it was released the same year as Welles' abject misstep &#x96; 1948's other Shakespeare film, Macbeth.Now, taking into account Welles' ridiculous time and budget constraints, we can easily forgive his involvement with Macbeth. We can chalk it up to a tune that rings true of the majority of his career &#x96; his vision far exceeding his time (and schedule and pocketbook). He was given something like 3 weeks to execute and it shows &#x96; from his confusing and uninteresting direction, ridiculous sets and costumes and the flat-out abysmal performances. It is an amateurish, unintelligible and nonredeemable misfire on every level. I've always wondered how Welles felt about Olivier's success (and carte blanche studio backing) with this project, given that it is very clearly influenced by his own method of filmmaking.The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is perhaps the most renown of all Shakespeare's plays (save, maybe, Romeo and Juliet). Hamlet's Uncle Claudius (conspiring with Hamlet's mother Gertrude), poisons his brother the King and takes control of the throne. Hamlet, already wary of his mother's hasty remarriage, is visited by the ghost of his father, who reveals to him the entire ordeal. Hamlet recreates the act in a play, leaving Claudius paranoid and desperate to get rid of Hamlet using various methods. Hamlet's complicated relationship with Ophelia is touched on in the film, but is left fairly underdeveloped.The film is championed by two co-MVPs that make this the ultimate Hamlet. The first is its cinematography. It is simply gorgeous to look at. Shadows are utilized to create a mesmerising Gothic picture in every frame. Close-ups and high and low angles accentuate the tone, and are often brought together with impeccable fluidity.The second triumph is the acting. This is considered by many to be Olivier's opus &#x96; the crowning jewel in a career often regarded as the greatest of all-time. Shakespeare's words drip off Olivier's tongue like melted butter, and his recitation of Hamlet's most recognisable soliloquy is a veritable religious experience. Jean Simmons is entrancing as Ophelia and received a lot of attention for her performance, but Eileen Herlie's Gertrude is the one who lingers. She is equal parts alluring and sympathetic, and her work here ranks comfortably among my favourite supporting turns of the decade.Hamlet purists may grieve the complete omission of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who are as popular as any characters in the play and provide a special dynamic to the story. And the virtual excising of nearly all of Hamlet's soliloquies (save the most popular To be or not to be&#x85;) may irk those seeking a more complete adaptation. Still, Olivier's work here is world-class, directing himself to a Best Picture and Best Actor win in what I consider to be the standard by which all Shakespeare film adaptations should be judged.

Don't let that trick you into expecting anything less than grandeur from the sets and effects, because that would be selling those aspects short. The acting, also vital to this, is all excellent. I have not seen Olivier in much else, but he sure delivered(R.I.P.) an incredible performance here, not to mention the job he did on directing. There is a little humor. The plot deals with the death of loved ones, betrayal, the conscience, etc. This is well-paced, no time is wasted, and it never rushes where it ought to linger. While there are signs of the period in which it was made in this, on the whole, it feels more like a faithful version(I would barely even claim this to be an adaptation) of the famous and justly loved written work.

I thought Basil Sydney as King Claudius was wooden and Jean Simmons as Ophelia was overly theatrical despite her Academy Award nomination.Overall, I commend Laurence Olivier for directing a complex film and portraying a multi dimensional character.I want to end with a footnote.

Eileen Herlie was a bit young at only 28 years old to play mother to Lord Laurence Olivier's Hamlet who was probably older than she was at the time but you can't imagine a better actress to play Gertrude, Queen of Denmark. I wonder why she didn't get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress like her co-star Jean Simmons. She was just as worthy of a nomination. I would like to see Eileen Herlie get a British honor such as an M.B.E.(Member of the Order of the British Empire) for her services to drama especially after spending 30 years on All My Children as the beloved Myrtle Fargate. I hope that she does get honored still even in her mid-eighties. She looks great and is still working occasionally on All My Children.

What they overlook, however, is that in 1948 Olivier was attempting something quite new in bringing Shakespeare to a mass, moviegoing audience. That along with a limited budget may well explain both his oversimplified approach to Hamlet's character and his excessive textual cuts. To contrast his pioneering 52-year old effort with current movie technique is a-historical in that it essentially denies the evolutionary process in film artistry. One other point Jean Simmons was not Olivier's wife. Not in 1948, not later, not ever. Over the years many have confused her classic beauty with that of Vivien Leigh, who was Olivier's second wife. But to state that Simmons was cast as Ophelia because she was married to the boss is both incorrect and unfair (unless, that is, Stewart Granger was, retroactively, the secret head of the Hamlet project).

In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor the Presentational approach, and the Representational approach. In the Presentational approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible, by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life. In the Representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion, through a high degree of control of movement and sound.The Representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this Hamlet was made. British theater has a long history of this style of acting, and Olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the Representational school.Time has not been kind to this school of acting, or to this movie. Nearly every working actor today uses a Presentational approach. To the modern eye, Olivier's highly enunciated, stylized delivery is stodgy, stiff and stilted. Instead of creating an internally conflicted Hamlet, Olivier made a declaiming, self-important bullhorn out of the melancholy Dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger London theaters, but is far too starchy to carry off a modern Hamlet.And so the movie creaks along ungainfully today. Olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of Hamlet's lines unintentionally funny In-stead, you must ac-quire and be-get a tem-purr-ance that may give it... Smooth-ness! Instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost (as any proper actor could), bright fill lights in Olivier's pupils give us that impression.Eileen Herlie is the only other actor of note in this Hamlet, putting in a good essay at the Queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). The other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done, given Olivier's tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! Sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable, flawed Hamlet, and instead elected to portray a sort of Elizabethan bullhorn. Final analysis I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant; it out-herods Herod pray you, avoid it.

I'm not a huge fan of Shakespeare even though I've read this play and see a few different film versions of it. Technically speaking this film is flawless but I don't think it's as good as the Branagh version. I think the biggest problem I had with the film is that it really didn't feel like a movie. I'm not sure if that makes any sense but the movie came off more like a filmed version of a play instead of a regular movie, which I thought took away from some of the dramatic scenes. Outside of that there's really nothing negative I can say about the film as it's beautiful to look out with some incredible sets and great costumes. The performances are all terrific with Olivier really standing out among the crowd. It was nice seeing Peter Cushing in his small role and Jean Simmons was great as well.

Unlike Olivier's innovative and daring debut this is far more traditional film making. The style is rather theatrical, it is hard to make Shakespeare seem natural due to the complicated language involved but it has been done multiple times. What works on the stage does usually not work in film. Don't misunderstand me. I did like it. In fact it's probably the best film adaptation I have seen of Hamlet. It's competently done and does indeed have the Shakespeare magic.However, in my humble opinion it's very flawed. It makes some changes from the original play that really lessened it, not that I'm against changing classical plays but here there was no point to it. One of my favorite parts, the plot about changing the letters, have been removed. And the characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have been removed. Which annoyed me seeing how I just watched Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, which was what inspired me to finally check this film out.But lets not rest at that. Could you believe that Eileen Herlie, 10 years the junior of Laurence Olivier, was his mother? In their scenes together I would rather have believed she was his daughter. She did a great job and with a younger lead it could have been very believable, but this way it was rather annoying. Furthermore it saddens me to say that Olivier didn't fit the part either. He looked too old and oddly enough he seemed to have a problem finding his usual charisma.My main disappointment however was how non-cinematic it all was. As mentioned it was rather theatrical. Many of scenes resembled nothing but a taped play. What annoyed me was how little they seemed to have tried. The frames were just so average and far from spectacular you could cry. And the effects was far from good. Smoke covering the ghost did not(too me) look as good as I assume they intended. And the flashes of the ships at sea was not at all necessary, especially since next to nothing was shown. It was just told. This though was probably a attempt to elevate it cinematically.Overall a disappointment. Not because it was bad, but because I had expected so much more. With 7 Oscar noms and 4 wins, including best picture and a best lead for Olivier I have to shake my head in disbelief. The three other BP nominees I have have seen from this year are all better and contains far better acting from their respective leads. As it stands Hamlet is one of the 10 weakest films ever to win the BP. As stated a good film, but far from an impressive one. I give it a weak 7.

Olivier would have better played Claudius or even the ghostly apparition. Too late, too late to play Hamlet the unready, unsteady representation of Shakespeare's inner torment of what to do when royal blood must be spilt and murder must be done. Another poster asked why did Hamlet feign madness? The situation was maddening. He must accept his father's command and thereby kill his uncle, an annointed king and this in a time (Shakespeare's own) when kingship conferred a kind of divinity that was not seriously damaged until the execution of a future Stuart king in a time when the killing of a king was sanctioned by the state. So tormenting was Hamlet's quandary that he paid with his life and that being the only possible ending of the tale, no wonder that he dithered a bit. Watch Mel's 1990 version to see a more human and dare I say it, more comprehensible man who better revealed the inner torment of this most impossible situation. By the way, for my money, the best Shakespeare on film my be Macbeth by King Orson with Mel's Hamlet a bit behind but still far preferable to the very narcissistic Hamlet that Olivier provided.

He is up there with Marlon Brando, Cary Grant, James Stewart, and Robert De Niro, and past the majority of them. He is also the best shakesphear actor, although Kenneth Branagh is not far behind. But unfortunately Branagh may be great at shakesphear but he falters at everything else. Lawrence Oliviers performance in Hamlet is one of our greatest, he is flawless. It is unfortunate that most of the rest of the casts performances are far from great. Jean Simmons alone is almost as good as Olivier. Olivier's direction is not quite as strong as his performance, but is still something. He knows the story and respects it so much, and he keeps so close to the original play, so close it seems almost impossible that he actually got it made.

There is not a single Olivier version of a Shakespeare play that holds up today.  His _Henry V_ is a piece of wartime propaganda (though memorable as such).  His _Othello_ is very nearly embarrassing (though no worse than the Fishburne version, it compares poorly to Welles's).  But his _Hamlet_ is his most egregious error.The problem with Olivier is never in the acting itself, but in the way he decides to play the character at the outset.  Once he decides to play Hamlet as a man who can't make up his mind, his decisions make sense, but what on earth made him interpret the character that way?Consider  Hamlet sees an apparition, claiming to be his father, who asks him to take revenge on his uncle (and mother's new husband and king, all three of which give him reason to expect Hamlet's loyalty). He then goes about trying to establish the truth of this charge before acting on it.  When he does act, the result is tragic.  Five deaths result, and that is not counting the earlier deaths of Ophelia and Polonius (who is killed the first time Hamlet strikes too precipitously).  It looks to me as if Hamlet is justified in delaying his actions as long as possible, yet Olivier implies that a normal man would have come in from the battlements, run up to his uncle's room, and slit his throat immediately.  Put yourself in Hamlet's position  would you automatically trust a spirit that told you to commit murder just because it bore some resemblance to your father?  Or would you question its identity, not to mention your own sanity?What Olivier seems not to understand is that Hamlet is fundamentally a man of action, though a man of action who is aware that his actions have consequences. He is divided determined to act, destructive when he does act, and simultaneously disconnected from his actions.  (Freud no doubt stole his concept of ego, id, and superego from the play, just as he stole his misnamed Oedipus complex -- it is really the Hamlet complex -- from the same source).  Whenever I see the Olivier version, I feel compelled to run out and watch the Zeffirelli version immediately; Mel Gibson's fiery Hamlet, though not perfect, is a wonderful antidote to Oliver's ultimately anemic prince.As for the rest of the cast, Jean Simmons (Olivier's wife) is adequate, but the others are almost uniformly forgettable.  Certainly no one approaches the quality of Derek Jacobi as Claudius in Branagh's version.The production values are, as with most British Shakespeare adaptations, distressingly stagy.  The RSC (Royal Shakespeare Company) types are usually better actors than film-makers.   It has taken people like Zeffirelli and Branagh (yes, he's British trained, but considered quite radical) to embrace the cinematic possibilities of Shakespeare instead of being bound by the conventions of theatre.None of this makes Olivier's _Hamlet_ a film to avoid at all costs.  The writing is at the heart of most movies, and you can't go wrong with the Bard.  But given the choice, see the Branagh, or the Zeffirelli-Gibson, or even Nicol Williamson's version (similarly stagy, but at least with Anthony Hopkins as Claudius and a strange but interesting performance by Marianne Faithfull as Ophelia).One side-note  If you want to use Olivier's title, it is properly Lord Laurence, not Sir.  He is the only actor of recent vintage (maybe ever?) to receive the higher honor.  Of course, he always said, Just call me Larry, dear boy.

I enjoy Shakespeare and Hamlet is (obviously) one of his great plays. But not if you only knew it from this version.As others have said here, it's difficult to understand all the acclaim this film received in its day. Quickly looking over the list of Hamlet films on IMDb, it does seen that this 1948 production was the first filmed version since the silents (or at least the early talkies) so maybe that was part of it. And I suppose at the time the staging and set might have seemed unique (?). But it just came across to me as VERY stage-y, and far too dependent on clouds of dry ice smoke for atmosphere.The setting also suffers from an odd combination of not enough people (many scenes where nobody else seems to inhabit this big castle except Hamlet) followed by too many people (rooms suddenly fill up out of nowhere with hangers-on and courtiers). The castle is just WAY too big and full of odd, useless spaces that were probably meant to give you a sense of Hamlet's confusion and isolation but instead had me thinking about how big the soundstage must have been to build all these sets and what a pain it must have been to film and the tracking shots as the actors moved around. And the matched set of 6 trumpeters appearing out of nowhere to play elaborate fanfares every time the King walks by felt like something out of a Warner Bros. cartoon. I kept expecting them to turn sideways and be playing cards.The age thing? The fact that Olivier was 41 is not the problem. It's the fact that with the heavy theatrical makeup and bad blond dye job/wig he looks 52. Part of what Hamlet is about is the problem of being a young adult confronting big issues for the first time in your life. In this version, you keep wondering why this middle-aged man can't get it together.As for Olivier's talents -- well, he certainly does have the technical ability to speak Shakespeare in a way that generally makes sense of the words -- but good phrasing is NOT the same thing as being able to ACT it well.In all, there was not one aspect of this film that made me think it was worth watching it. It gets a 3 from me only on the strength of it being Shakespeare's text (or at least some of it.)

But as one who has seen a good deal of Shakespeare but never, before now, this one, I was disappointed. This is supposed to be his greatest play? I can't believe that - from this movie anyway. I was frequently bored, irritated with Hamlet's sometimes cryptic behaviour, and felt it was too long. First time I've ever been bored by a Shakespeare play or felt it was too long! I was frankly astonished. But I can see Shakespeare's genius is there so I presume the problem is what's left out has damaged what's left.Shakespeare's plays are never just one plot theme. There are subplots and variety. Before now he has never disappointed me in any way. Hamlet is so long and an enormous amount of it must have been deleted to make this version. The result is certainly focused, so far as I can tell from not knowing what's missing, on the various murders past and to come and Hamlet's bizarre behaviour and dithering etc. I discovered he was furious with his mother but it's not clear to me whether his mother married the new king willingly, or was coerced, or it was purely political or a sensible move for her protection. Instead of flying off the handle, Hamlet needs to discover her motives and whether she could have refused the marriage. Presumably the complete play fills in these details but this version doesn't that I can see. So I was frequently mystified by Hamlet's bad temper with his mother and worse, with his girl friend whom he treated so disgracefully I was simply furious. Am I meant to feel any kind of sympathy for this guy when he insults a young and seemingly innocent, indeed quite naive (if the acting was portraying the text properly) young woman persistently in lewd language that although it seems normal in those days, clearly was blaming her for faults she didn't possess. One must assume Hamlet was an ignorant, ill-bred and rather stupid youth who saw women as sex objects, no more!I think the best part is undoubtedly the ghost's appearance and Hamlet's reactions. The Yorick scene disappointed me a bit. After seeing David Bowie's classic and superb Hamlet song in his amazing Serious Moonlight Concert, I really did expect something better from the play. Was that part cut too? This version drags in the middle - I was simply fed up with Hamlet ranting about insulting people and killing his girlfriend's father. Doubtless I'm meant to be angry with him for dithering about but I needed some more of the text to show me this is not a boring play.I suppose I'll have to read the play. I don't much want to watch the Branagh version - I've been disappointed in all his Shakespeare movies and him in them with the possible exception of Benedick which suits him so I can't believe his Hamlet will impress me, so I'd rather avoid it. I loathe Mel Gibson and won't ever again watch him in anything after the one time I quickly regretted as he pranced about being heroically pathetic and wallowing in being tortured - urk. Torture happens. Wallowing in depicting it is sick.There are actors who've done Hamlet that I'd like a lot to see but they aren't on film that I know of. I'll be watching the BBC version in due course - I missed it first time around on TV.All that said, I think Olivier looked the part and what he had of text to act he acts well. He's too old though. Surely Hamlet is meant to be a very young man who hasn't yet found the strength to know how to carry through revenge, who hasn't learned how to talk to or respect women nor to understand they are constrained by being chattels of men in those days (clearly Shakespeare in this play is indicating how women suffer and Hamlet's a bigoted fool). This version needed to keep up the tension but too often nothing much happens and ranting and raving can be a real turn off. Where were Rosencrantz and Gildenstein? Not that I know yet what they do in the play but surely it would help to have them and some others to galvanise this movie.
