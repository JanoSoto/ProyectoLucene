From watching his films, he seems to like his characters to exist in his strange world where things are exaggerated and ridiculous characters do unrealistic things.That sums up Mallrats - it's the story of two friends who both lose their girlfriends and then spend the rest of the day hanging around in the local mall.  Whilst hanging around they meet friends and get into scrapes as they strive to get their girlfriends back.I suppose if you looked at it coolly it's all a bit silly - fully of ridiculous situations and scrapes that are resolved in unbelievable ways. But then if you accept Smith's world of comic book style adventures and cartoon film making then this is great.  Whereas his later Chasing Amy brings adult subjects into the comedy - this is pure cartoon comedy, although understand it's not dumb like slapstick - but crazy, clever humour with plenty of jokes occuring all around the main action.OK the overall plot is weak at best, but the story is more about the characters and the situations along the journey to the end of the film and here is where Smith wins.  He has created crazy characters that are funny and often exaggerated versions of people or of people's reactions to situations (witness the magic-eye poster guy for an example of exaggerated humour).Lee is fantastic, this is the role he was made for - he reacts in an exaggerated way to everything and really hams it up.  I suppose he's a comic-book reading loser but in this world he is funny and in control.  He is loud and abusive to others and it's great!  Jeremy London is a weak straight man and doesn't really convince.Jay & Silent Bob are good as always - although for most of the movie they exist in their own little subplot of taking on the mall police.  Again their adventures are exaggerated for humour.If you hated Clerks and Smith's other movies then you'll hate this. However if this world is one that appeals to you then you'll love this movie's reckless abandonment of reality and enjoy the adventures involved in a trip to the mall.

Even without watching the DVD with commentary by Smith its obvious that this outing was backed by Hollywood, emitting a polish and lack of gloom that his other films don't have and thus gaining flack over its lack of Indie look and feel and hammy storyline. Had this film been in black in white, shot using a cheaper production method, or had a less happier ending, it possibly would have fared better with the fans than it did.Listen to the dialogue though and its soon apparent this is indeed pure Smith. And it shines. The long diatribes about seemingly nothing, the anti-establishment rumblings of Brody (who ironically spends a lot of the film clarifying escalator ettiquite and other mall law), and a bigger involvement of Jay and Bob (but not too much) make this as good, if not better than the other Kevin Smith films and quite possibly my favourite of his.Its hard to rate this film, you'll either really like it and give it a 10 or tuck into another chocolate pretzel after giving it a 1.

I liked it. I enjoyed all the dirty street humour, the awkwardness, the characters and the concept.It's full of slapstick comedies, comic book 'adventure' and some witty (and dirty) dialogues. Even though many of the situations are unrealistic, it's hilarious.'Mallrats' is about two friends who both lose their girlfriends. The two friends spend the rest of the day in the mall discussing things and what to do about them. In the mall they meet some friends, enemies, and weirdos. Though the plot isn't what would be referred to as a work of 'genius', it's more the characters and the funny situations that will stick to mind.The only sequence I didn't like was the toilet humour bit, about making the hand stink. That sort of brought down the film a little. The film was already on the right track with its funny characters and funny situations. There was no need for toilet humour.London and Lee play the two friends. London is okay while Lee is very good. He pretty much steals every scene. Doherty and Forlani are adequate. Lauren Adams is brilliant in a brief role and Affleck is good as the evil Salesman. Mewes and Smith are alright (though some may feel that they go a little over the top).So all in all, you'll meet some very weird (and not-so-weird) characters and exaggerated situations but I think you'll at least have some good laughs. It's one of the better comedies from a country that has made dozens of blockbuster garbage like 'American Pie'.

This is the second film in the New Jersey series by Kevin Smith. This entry is miles better than its predecessor Clerks.I loved how Kevin Smith did this movie. Kevin Smith is a comic book geek, so I'm glad he made a movie to portray that taste. Comic book lovers will truly enjoy all the references and parodies within the film. I know I did. That's what made the movie even more enjoyable to me. The appearance of Stan Lee was the cherry on the ice cream for me. Aside from that, this movie is just paced and styled better than Clerks was. This was non stop laughs whereas Clerks was more of a satirical black comedy. Also, a lot happened throughout the film even though it only takes place within a day and within the same mall, rather than Clerks which was slow moving and downright boring in some parts.I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Jason Lee is hilarious as comic book fanatic Brodie Bruce. Jay and Silent Bob have a lot more to do in this film than in Clerks, and they make some of the funniest scenes in the movie.Overall, Kevin Smith had his practice with Clerks, so he had the resources to make a better film, and he certainly did.

Quint(Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) go to the mall to keep their minds off the situation. Soon, however, thoughts turn to getting their ladies back and the dynamic duo will have to fight mall security, a fashionable male (Ben Affleck) and a game show producer (Michael Rooker) in order to succeed.Writing a fair review of Mallrats is one of the hardest things for me to do, and it is no surprise that I have not done so in all the years I have been writing reviews. The film came out when I was fourteen, and I went to see it with my cousin at the local mall after a rousing bus trip. We had seen the ambiguous advertisements in the back of comic books for months and just knew this was something we had to see. Once in the theater, we were practically alone -- there were only three other people, including a younger woman and her grandmother, both of whom walked out early on.For whatever reason, I identified with this film. I had not yet seen Clerks and I did not have the background in film to really understand all the references to Jaws or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid or Apocalypse Now. But the potty humor mixed with the intelligent dialogue (even about scatological topics) hit home with me, and even now -- seventeen years later -- it remains my favorite film, despite my knowing full well it is not critically wonderful and often sexually crude.I have given the film a high rating because I simply cannot get enough of it. I have the trading cards that were sold at the time, I have visited the Eden Prairie Center where the movie was filmed (it is in Minnesota, not New jersey, strangely enough). But, I want to stress this my high rating does not by any means indicate this is a critically beautiful film. Read the reviews of the professionals at the time (Ebert, Maltin, and others) and you will see that it was more or less expected to bomb (although I think in hindsight many more people found the film to their liking).Are there flaws? You bet. Watch Jeremy London, for example. A horrible, horrible actor. Even with these odd, scripted conversations he comes off as forced, and if you watch him while another actor is speaking, you can see him physically preparing himself to speak his lines. He cannot become the character of T.S. Quint, he can only be Jeremy London. Shannon Doherty, likewise, just does not seem to hack it... she is a better actress than many, but this film just did not work for her. She comes off as a reject from Empire Records, and some lines she delivers make it seem she is not familiar with the subject matter.Despite the flaws, I am still praising this film. Watch Clerks first (even though this one takes place first in chronological order). If you like Clerks, try this one. Then try Chasing Amy. All three are great. Personally, I think Kevin Smith's films went downhill after that (although Red State is redeeming). He may disagree and I know many of the fans do. But if you do not mind intelligent potty humor, Mallrats is for you. "}{"Title":"Actors?

They get dumped by their girlfriends - really they should get dumped by the entire world.  They are self-centered in the extreme, immature in the extreme, and incredibly annoying.  The whole movie is based on a single gimmick  take an actual conversation, transcribe it into Microsoft Word, then use the thesaurus tool to replace every adjective with more obscure ones.  That's it.  It goes on without pause for the entire film - people talk about nothing in this clever way.  I just saw the film last night and I honestly can't remember a single topic of any conversation that took place.  Needless to say, the two main characters are beyond shallow.  They don't have any personalities other than that they like video games, comic books, and they just will not stop talking - ever.  Even though they never say anything.  We're supposed to be impressed by the clever use of oddball words, for instance calling a pool table a gaming table. Man, wouldn't you just love to sit through two hours of people doing this?  Let me tell you, it makes Pauly Shore and his screwball take on Valley Girl talk seem enjoyable by comparison.There are other characters  Shannon Doherty puts in a cameo.  She's really the only likable character in the movie, and says about the only funny line. Some other girl who's name doesn't deserve to be remembered plays the other loser's girlfriend.  She recites a few lines of dialog at the beginning, a few more towards the end.  Another girl named Gwen starts out all right, she's like Kelly Bundy from Married with Children, except twice as slutty, but by the end of her part she's speaking via the thesaurus as well.  Jay and Silent Bob?  Jay is a stoner who acts like he's got to go to the bathroom really bad;  Bob is just a fat idiot who spends the whole movie pointing his hand at things and trying to use the force to move objects. There's also a comic book writer who shows up to inject a large amount of padding into a scene.  The head doofus asks him if that guy from the Fantastic Four who was made out of rock, well, was his you-know-what made out of rock as well?  Is that wacky or what?  Ha ha.  This goes on and on.Overall, this movie is flat out unwatchable.  The special features on the DVD are a joke as well.  It's advertised as having over an hour of deleted scenes.  The first ten minutes of these deleted scenes consists of a film of an unused script.  Actual film of the script, you know, hold the camera in front of the paper and slowly pan down.  About two thirds of the scenes are the writer talking about the scenes.  There's supposedly a trailer on the DVD as well - good luck trying to find it.

It not only made my list of the ten worst movies of all time, it took first place on the list.I kept waiting for someone to act. No one ever did. I waited for the director to show that he had some idea of what film making is all about. That never happened. I thought that, at least, the writing would eventually show that there was some reason why this film was made, but when the credits finally, mercifully, rolled, no reason whatever had yet appeared.I'll say this for the movie, though it didn't score a perfect '10' and so achieve the distinction of being a total loss. There was one scene where, for between three and ten seconds, something approaching reality actually took place. That was when T.S.'s old girlfriend kicked him in the groin.I just hope that audiences and the motion picture industry don't hold this movie against the cast. Perhaps, just perhaps, a few of them may actually have the ability to entertain. If so, in this movie, they never got a chance to show it.If Mr. Smith decides he wants to produce and direct another film, I'd strongly advise him to get a fifth grader to write his screenplay.

So the two team up with the help of Jay and Silent Bob to come up with a plan to win them back.

After the huge and promising success that was Clerks for director/writer Kevin Smith. Obiviously there was pressure to repeat that winning formula with his follow up. Even though Mallrats is a more bigger and polished studio bound production of Clerks set in the mall, it just didn't take off at all. It came and went by with little interest. Maybe it doesn't hold that fundamentally cunning humour and smarting realism that made the low budget film Clerks originally quirky and fresh. I'm not a big fan of Smith's work, as I've only caught his first three flicks and I still think his third film Chasing Amy is the best. But this commercially mainstream project isn't all a failure, because the film still does come up with an entertaining tale of laid-back characters with a muster of jokes set-up in a mall. Definitely much more crass and juvenile are the gags this time and somewhat the humour tries to be funny than naturally being it. But what compensates it is that there was a continuous roll with one after another, so if one didn't work out there's another that would hopefully evoke a laugh. The film is actually made up of little episodes that happen throughout the day with something endlessly popping up and many characters deciding to make a scene. It's all over the place you can say. There are some memorably comical sequences like that of the Stan Lee cameo, the Easter bunny and that of the cheesy date game show. But there's one lewd segment involving chocolate pretzels, which will make you barf.What makes this quite fun is that of the lively performances of Jason Lee's self-absorbed Brodie and the always reliable pairing of Jay and Silent Bob. Also adding to the enjoyable mess are Shannon Doherty, Claire Forlani, Jeremy London, Joey Lauren Adams, Priscilla Barnes, Michael Rooker and a slimy performance by Ben Affleck. The spontaneous dialog is self-conscious with its referential gags and it's filled with a carefree attitude and pure nonsense amongst the stemming wisdom and frankness. Especially those facts considering that of the mall's customs and the respect it deserves. Heck! I should know, as I had a friend that persistently visited the mall everyday&#133; just to be there for the sake of it. Though, I thought it turned into moralistic babble in the dying stages. But these things don't take away from sarcastic interplay and skits that are generated throughout the running time, even though it really seems like an eccentric melodrama with humorous overtones at times. A nice bubblegum rock soundtrack crops up to mould itself within the context and the camera-work has a professional touch too. The best way to take it is to see it as good undemanding fun!Smith tried outdoing himself here, but sometimes it doesn't work and it seems more conventional than his other films, but that doesn't stop this from being alluringly amusing and satisfying when you comes to the ending credits.

Kevin is smarter than his subject, Ben very much dumber.  He convinced Smith and Mosier to help him out, so they produced `Will,' leveraging their own goodwill. With `Will' the vision was less tight than with a Smith-written bit so the studio was able to gloss it up.  But you can see Ben in his real persona here.

'Mallrats' wishes in it's wildest dreams that it can be a 'Clerks' but unfortunately for the audience 'Mallrats' plays like a 'Meet the Spartans'-'Epic Movie' type parody of 'Clerks'. Kevin Smith is a great writer and 'Clerks' is a four star film but he is 100% to blame for the failure of 'Mallrats' and it is a failure of epic proportions.I felt as I watched the film I became detached from it as you often do with a bad movie. My mind wandered to a stupid Hollywood producer sitting above the shoulder of a Kevin Smith hot off 'Clerks' and giving him a few million dollars or so to 'reproduce' that success but to dumb it down for the masses. Smith obliged.What is the problem with 'Mallrats'? Well it plays like a bad sitcom. It's jokes are incredibly stupid and have a laugh track type quality to them. Don't get me wrong conceptually the thing is very reminiscent of the structure of the superior 'Clerks'. What 'Clerks' did that 'Mallrats' fails to do is to develop characters. Yes Dante and Randal went into filthy rants about the world but they were fully dimensional human beings with motive to their laziness and we liked them. TS and Brodie are cartoons with catch phrases and camera winking. Randal's brilliant monologue about 'Return of the Jedi' is reproduced a little bit in 'Mallrats' with references to comics and 'Star Wars' but 'Mallrats' doesn't create characters that would organically talk in that fashion. I guess that is my main problem with the picture everything seems so incredibly and painfully fake.

Mallrats at the time was criticized as one of his worst films.

So they decide to hang out at the mall. They eventually end up meeting characters Jay and Silent Bob, as well as their ex-girlfriends. The film is predictable as in it is ultimately tat they will win back their girlfriends, but the quest is how they do it, and their obstacles along the way. In which, they end up on a game show. The finale is somewhat dis interesting, although it provides for entertainment.Mallrats provides some entertainment, but in general of rewatching the film, I have found many of the jokes and gags to be cheesy, outdated, and general not funny.

I'll admit that the humour put through via dialogue is smooth and close to seamless as well as the fact it contains entertaining one liners and interesting repetitions of a certain jokes; something we saw in 'Clerks.' (1994) that was used to good effect, albeit a little too often.Although the basics seem to be present and are exploited well, the real bulk of Mallrats its plot, characters and acting all fail to live up to the hype. The film begins to play out like a love triangle comedy and although the script is trying to paper over the cracks, it doesn't take a genius to see that, really, it's just a load of slapstick humour in a mall with a love theme (I say 'theme' because there is not enough evidence to suggest this is a romance story). The fact that a shopping mall is used as the setting for the duration of the film is a little silly and as a 'world' for the characters, it soon grates. The settings become repetitive, the scenes predictable and the whole thing just gets frustrating.Before I saw the film, it was built up as one thing, but what the finish product was, was something completely different. It was a cheap, wannabe cult film that ended up like a rom-com with a load of slapstick. I mean, how many times can you re-watch a film where someone trips, flies through the air and crashes into a female changing room booth door and is supposed to act as the humour? The plot for the film is supposed to read something like the following 'Two guys are dumped by their girlfriends and hang around a mall all day'. Fine, but where's the rest of it? There are numerous, ludicrous events that happen during the film such as the silly recording of a date game show (yawn) and the daft tactics that the characters Jay and Silent Bob use to defeat security guards (Batman gadgets to winch away to safety?!). Things like this can only be put up with for so long before they become tiresome and unbelievable. The film was built up as something much more simple than this so why didn't it play out in a much simpler manner? Perhaps more similar to Clerks.Although some of the acting by Jay and Silent Bob is rather funny and the script is witty in general, especially the opening monologue which was a great way to announce the film, Mallrats is let down by its inability to keep a good, consistent, realistic joke going in the long run. The antics and slapstick become dull and by the time the laughably bad climax has arrived, you really have switched off; pretty much entirely. Fans of this will like it for a while but will grow out of it in time but by that time, a whole new generation will have come along and started to like it, so I guess at least that's a good thing.

After indy mega-hit CLERKS proved his worth, Hollywood handed him carte blanche on an engraved silver salver.  By his own admission, this film could have been made for far far less than the six million the studio insisted he spend. Before DVD, MALLRATS was just another VHS on the previously viewed sales table.  But now, thanks to the miracle of digital technology, it is all too clear where Smith and studio went offtrack and re-defined the notion of the second picture jinx.  Packed with more than an hour of deleted scenes and extras, MALLRATS' DVD gives us Smith's original intentions before Tinseltown know-it-alls put their six million cents in.  Those familiar with (what was then known as) The Smart PORKIES, will be surprised to find Elizabeth Ashley as a nearly assassinated NJ Governor in a plot that was to kick off the film and would have put a wittier black-comedy slant on the proceedings to come.  Studio execs even threatened to prohibit Smith pal Jason Mewes from recreating his Jay character from CLERKS.  Fortunately, Smith won at least this little battle.Severely re-cut and toned down, MALLRATS is a shadow of what it might have been.  Aimless and bland, the film ends with a shallow and contrived game show (in a mall?!?) which brings together all it's pointless characters in one pat conclusion.  Film buffs will make the inevitable comparison to SHOCK TREATMENT, the follow-up to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which also attempted to re-unite characters from the hit first flick with an imposed satire on TV and suburbia.  Maybe someday mallrats will gather at midnight screenings, inserting their own witty retorts to Smith's smart dialogue, shouting wildly at the screen and dressed just like Jay and Silent Bob!

That film had a very low budget and a fantastic script whereas this film has a much larger budget ($6million) and an incredibly mediocre script. It seems like a watered down version of Clerks in that the dialogue is nowhere near as witty or well observed (though it tries to be) and T.S., Brodie, Rene and Gwen are basically the poor man's Dante, Randal, Veronica and Caitlin. I had heard that many people found it disappointing but I went in an open mind, only to find out that they were right. When Smith guest starred in Degrassi The Next Generation, he poked fun at the film's poor reception in dialogue that he wrote himself. Caitlin Ryan tells him that this is her favourite Kevin Smith film and he replies, You're lying. 'Mallrats' is no one's favourite Kevin Smith film. I just hope that the sequel MallBrats is better than this.On the bright side, Jason Lee is quite funny as Brodie and has most of the good lines but he could have been so much funnier with better material. The same goes for Michael Rooker as Svenning and Jason Mewes and Smith as Jay and Silent Bob, the only returning characters from Clerks in spite of numerous references to it. Jeremy London is likable as T.S. but the character doesn't have much of a personality and is a far less effective straight man to Brodie than Dante was to Randal. Ethan Suplee's subplot as Willam goes nowhere very slowly. Claire Forlani has been much better elsewhere while Joey Lauren Adams deserved more screen time. Shannen Doherty is simply forgettable as Rene but Ben Affleck is quite good as Shannon Hamilton. My favourite scene in the film is when Stan Lee gives the completely starstruck Brodie romantic advice but that is more of a sweet scene than a funny one.

There are moments in Mallrats, mostly during scenes where the main characters are just walking through the mall and just talking, where Smith's humor really works and achieves the same sort of authenticity Clerks and Chasing Amy do with their dialogue. Other than those scenes Mallrats is a haphazard collection of poorly-written and performed slapstick set-pieces surrounded by an overly silly and poorly-paced 'plot'.If Mallrats improves in any way at all on Clerks it is in terms of the technical aspects of the film. Smith's use of music (the studio's use of music?) is particularly bad, but he also makes generally good use of the bigger budget this film was given. The script, however, is just a disaster, albeit one with a few bright spots. I thought the extended version, which is about half an hour longer, would be a bit better but it does nothing to improve the film and is in fact nearly unwatchable and far worse than the theatrical version.Mallrats, beyond just not being funny at all, is incredibly heavy-handed when it goes for drama, and considering that he followed this up with Chasing Amy, one of my favorite screenplays and a great movie all around, it's especially surprising how ludicrous and just BAD Mallrats is. See the elevator scenes between Shannen Doherty and Jason Lee, unbelievably bad in every way- writing, direction, acting, everything.Smith is lucky his career survived Mallrats, such a huge failure in every way imaginable.

I have some favorites like Clerks, Clerks II and Chasing Amy. And some that I consider funny enough but lacking something to make them a favorite of mine. Mallrats is one of those movies.Smith's previous movie Clerks is my favorite of his. I did not expect another Clerks in Mallrats and I wasn't disappointed with the result. I think Mallrats works as a simple 80's style comedy, yet trying to maintain elements that made Clerks such a great film.The main characters T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brodie (Jason Lee) are, in a way, the Dante and Randal (the protagonists of Clerks) of this movie. The character traits are similar, T.S. would be Dante, the straight man, and Brodie would be Randal, the wacky funny one.The big, and I mean big difference is that both characters from Clerks are equally interesting. This is not the case in Mallrats. While Brodie Bruce is perhaps the funniest and most memorable character in the movie, T.S. feels like a dull, weakly-written character that doesn't get any better with Jeremy London's acting. Jason Lee is hilarious, but his weak buddy hurts what could have been a memorable partnership.As for the story, it's alright. I cannot praise it much but I can't bash it either.The supporting characters are, however, very good. Ethan Suplee as Willam Black aka the sailboat guy is very funny, and Michael Rooker as Mr. Svenning is a scene-stealer sometimes. The girls (Shannen Doherty and Claire Forlani) did a decent job, but nothing remarkable about it. And of course Jay and Silent Bob who are always great. This is the first movie, though, to feature the current version of Silent Bob. That is a more animated and lively Bob, as opposed to the serious, more introverted version from Clerks.So, to finish, Mallrats is a movie I enjoy, but one that does not get better with each viewing.

It's a shame that they cut Elizabeth Ashley, a brilliant actress. The film also pays homage to Smith's love of comic books with Stan Lee as himself. It's an okay, entertaining film but not brilliant and not one of my favorites. "},{"Title":"Good movie, bad ending","Date":"15 November 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Mallrats, Kevin Smith's second and most maligned film until Jersey Girl, isn't really that much of a stretch from Clerks. Mostly it just feels like a movie that got taken away from its creator by the studio system trying to make it more marketable--every filmmaker has at least one such experience. Still, Smith's comedic brilliance shines through in the writing. Characters are still aimless losers with nothing better to do than hang out and have epic conversations about meaningless nonsense--one of my favorite such discussions revolves around whether the cookie bakery is regarded as part of the food court, and another pontificates on Superman's romantic life. As with Clerks, the protagonists are experiencing miniature crises with their girlfriends, the resolution of which leads to the obvious but not heavy-handed moral Smith always interjects in his films.My only real complaint is the artificially feel-good ending, which feels too trite and sensational for what had, for the previous seventy minutes or so, been such a down-to-earth, slice-of-life comedy. It's like a bad Adam Sandler movie, the kind that always seems to end with cheering crowds and joyfully tearful make-up smooches. The bad guy gets his comeuppance, the lovable characters go on to fame and fortune, and everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. One of the things I love about Clerks. is that the ending, while resolving the conflict, ends without tying all the loose ends together. While Smith generically employs happy endings, they usually don't feel quite as predictable and saccharine. I've never heard him speak out on the subject, but I get the feeling the new ending was probably tacked on as the result of poor test screenings, or changed at the script stage because of the asinine notes studios like to give to more inexperienced indie directors.The cast is great. Jason Lee, of course, steals every scene he's in, even though he's supposed to be the sidekick here. He's a talented actor, and it's too bad that, with the possible exception of The Incredibles and My Name is Earl (I've only seen a few episodes), he's never been utilized quite as effectively as he is in a Kevin Smith movie. Jason Mewes, mercifully, retains the role of Jay in spite of the studio's wishes, and is as always a foul-mouthed fireball of energy. Joey Lauren Adams is suitably adorable, even in her role as a cheating ex. Shannen Doherty is wonderfully spirited and appropriately irritable without coming across as shrewish or horrible. Jeremy London performs his straight man role admirably, though since his job is to react to the lunacy around him more than participate in it, the audience never sympathizes with him the way we should--perhaps a bit of underwriting on Smith's part. Claire Forlani is cute enough, but her performance feels sort of flat for some reason.Mallrats, while it definitely suffers from sophomore slump, is still a great entry in the Jersey Chronicles, and has more than enough redemptive qualities to put it in a league far above 90% of most studio comedies. "}{"Title":"An Under-Appreciated Effort","Date":"26 October 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Following Kevin Smith's simplistic yet incredible debut, he got picked up by the indie patrons Bob and Harvey Weinstein. The powers that be threw money at Smith, who didn't even want it. He believed he could make Mallrats for at most 2 million. They gave him six. As a result, the film contains dialogue and events meant for a $500,000-$2 million picture and put $6 million worth of stuff in it. This makes a little too schlocky.To use the budget, Kevin writes a plot that involves too much movement. What could have been said one set is spread out to three. The film follows Quint and Brodie as they hang out in a mall after both being dumped by their girlfriends. Jason Lee rocks in his debut film performance as a snarky, wildly funny sidekick that usurps Jeremy London at every turn. Jay and Silent Bob still have the tiny role from Clerks even though it's a much bigger film. Chasing Amy also didn't give them a big role, but that film also didn't call for them as much. J&SB appear often here but don't have enough to do.Like all Kevin Smith films, the dialogue is incredible. Lee gives the lines his own flair, and is my favorite VA cast member. He even beats out Jeff Anderson's Randall in terms of acerbic wit. The schlocky elements, though a little annoying at times, are fairly well done and most of them get laughs.When this came out, the critics tore Kevin apart for the sophomore slump. In reality, he did the best possible job he could have considering all the studio pressure on him. Mallrats was a necessary flop that proved to the studio heads that Kevin was best left alone. That resulted in a string of great films from Chasing Amy to the most recent, Clerks II (yes, I even include Jersey Girl in that. It's a great film). This has been called the gateway film to the View Askewniverse, as this is the first Smith film many see. It is by no means a bad film, but it's probably Kevin's least accomplished effort. "},{"Title":"An insane and juvenile comedy, but for some people, that's not always a bad thing","Date":"28 July 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" I was too young to see this movie when it was first released, but first saw it about a decade later. When this happened, I must confess, I found it painfully boring! However, this may have simply been because I wasn't in a very good mood. I had just arrived at the house of some fairly long distance relatives and may have been tired after the long car ride. Thinking that could have easily been the case, I watched it again after a while, expecting to like it a lot more than I did previously, and I was right! Two teenagers, T.S. Quint and his best friend, the comic book-loving Brodie Bruce, are both dumped by their girlfriends on the same day. Obviously not happy about this, they decide to go to the mall and hang out. While inside, they encounter several people, including the mischievous Jay and Silent Bob, and Jared Svenning, the father of Brandi (T.S.' now ex-girlfriend), who is having a stage set up in the mall for his game show, Truth or Date. As T.S. and Brodie walk around the mall, they have plans to try and win their girlfriends back, though they will have to face the nasty Shannon Hamilton. Meanwhile, Jay and Silent Bob help by attempting to sabotage the Truth or Date game! With all the crudeness, juvenile gags (such as the You take your hand and stick it in your... part), etc. in Mallrats, it's obvious that the movie would irk some people (I'm sure those people know who they are). However, if toilet humour, sex jokes, slapstick, immaturity, and overall insanity are things you like to see in a comedy (it may depend on what mood you're in), this silly movie could give you many laughs. Some of the crude gags may be a bit thin, but there are many good ones as well, enough to make the movie a worthy experience. This Kevin Smith film was not well-received by critics upon its release, but fortunately, it has since managed to get itself a well-deserved cult following. "},{"Title":"A great movie about the joy in all the little things","Date":"24 May 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" With the valuable lesson that the little nuances found by hanging out at a shopping mall are the best parts of life, Mallrats is a piece of entertainment that's humor is crude yet insightful.Jeremy London and Jason Lee as two guys who have just ended relationships, but have markedly different attitudes about it and they have a really great odd couple chemistry as a result. London plays T.S. Quint, the hopeless romantic type, not over the loss of a girl and determined to get her back that we see often in movies and in ourselves in real life sometimes. Lee's character, Brodie, is more what the movie is about. He cheers himself and his friend up by taking a trip to the mall, and indulging in the cookie stand, the comic book shop, and conspiring with two shady characters (Jay and Silent Bob) to screw over his unpleasant neighbor, who also happens to be a major reason that his friend got dumped.Whether the film portrays Brodie's lifestyle is healthy or not is debatable, he lives with his mother and lacks ambition. However, I think Lee's character is the one we admire more of the two, because he is much happier and less worrisome over the course of the film as his counterpart T.S. and still gets the girl at the end.The movie takes place over a short period of real time, pretty much, a single afternoon at the mall. Along with the two protagonists, a series of pleasantly quirky recurring characters are all found hanging out, including Joey Lauren Adams (as T.S.'s promiscuous ex-girlfriend) and Ben Affleck (as a perverted department store owner) in different roles than they'll have in Smith's future project Chasing Amy.With great dialogue as a tool, these mundane interactions between these seemingly ordinary people come to life and as a result, it becomes so engaging to watch their paths intertwine all the way to the climactic live dating show scene at the film's finale.

Although in my opinion, Michael Rooker gives a rather gross performance (it's horrible to see his fat ass on screen!).As a Chinese, Kevin Smith seems too local for me, so I don't think I'm his loyal fan, but he's intelligent and has some good quality to make more WIDER films, and I do like silent bob, he's the funniest part in this film.

A day in the life of two Mallrats, brought to us by none other than Kevin Smith. It follows a little more of a storyline then its predecessor Clerks. Both are written and directed by Kevin Smith. Both star almost all then unknown actors. Both are classic. But enough comparing the two comedy classics. I will move to Mallrats.The film follows a variety of then unknown actors Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Joey Lauren Adams just to name a few. Lee and London play the leads as they both attempt to win back their ex-girlfriends at the local mall. They travel the mall with a little help from Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers with a sense of humor who always come in handy. London plays T.S. Quint, a young man recently dumped by the woman he wanted to marry at Universal Studios Theme Park. London isn't exactly the biggest name of actors but he does have a few good films out there. Mallrats is one of those few. His performance is believable and his comedy is great. The interaction between him and Lee is magnificent, especially in the last scene. Overall a solid job from London.Jason Lee steals the show for me. Having only done two works prior I believe Lee went into this project looking to make a name for himself. His comedy is by far the best and the way he delivers everything he says and does is just how I picture a real life Brodie Bruce acting. He is witty, he's smart mouth, he is cool, and he's a low life. How can you not love him? His last scene in the film is by far one of the funniest sequences I've ever seen.Mallrats plot isn't exactly there. Kind of like an updated Bio-Dome without stupid characters or a Dome. Unlike Bio-Dome, the actors are funny and the characters don't have to be mentally challenged to be funny. Mallrats is a classic of modern comedy. Equal with Dumb and Dumber and Happy Gilmore in laugh factors. It shouldn't be missed, there's too much to miss out on... if that makes sense.4/5 Stars "},{"Title":"Kevin Smith's very own Dawn Of The Dead.","Date":"27 February 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" A small overview of the story first Two guys, one a comic book freak (and Sega fan boy), both get dumped on the same morning and spends their day hanging out at the mall. I must say that for a movie and comic lover like myself this film is The Godfather, lovely meaningless dialouge all through the film because what do you do when you hang out at the mall? You talk about nothing.Jay and Silent Fat **** is in the film too as always of course, with Silent bob being a little too obsessed with Batman and Star Wars. I'm a teenager and I'm sorry, I can't find many arguments on how the is a good movie but I can tell you this, this film inspires people, it inspires me, it inspires by friends and many others mainly because of its use of diauloge and referencing of the things that I love which makes me more and more interested in watching the film from every word ever said in the film.As for the Dawn Of The Dead thing, it comes from a discussion I had with a fellow living-dead chum I have, saying that Kevin Smith is just like Romero! He started out in a confined area with Clerks, shot in black and white and then moved on to the shopping mall in color! Sounds ridiculous I know but it's kind of a neat little theory I think.

But to be honest, who makes movies strictly for the critics? If that was the case, you would lose the heart and soul of the film itself. I think Kevin Smith's direction and dialog are right on par with the witticism seen in Clerks I & II and especially in Chasing Amy. Smith's dialog is definitely a highlight, and the casting is great with the exception of Jeremy London. It's no wonder while most of the actors/actresses who have previously performed in Smith's movies have returned as their own characters or as others while London has been left out. His delivery is mediocre at it's best and plain embarrassing in others. But London's poor performance aside, Jason Lee is absolutely perfect as Brodie and his delivery and comic styling really are the carrying point of this film. The plot may be a little clichéd, however, the events that unfold throughout the movie make it different and one of a kind. Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) provide excellent comic slap stick style which compliments the witty and humorous dialog perfectly. Overall, a great movie, and one that should be seen despite critical reaction. If you replace Jeremy London with a better role player who could pull off some of the dialog with some believability, then this movie would be ranked higher. Overall, I definitely recommend this film to Smith fans, and to those who want to laugh...and laugh a lot!

From there we meet many well developed characters such as William(Ethan Supplee) who undoubtedly works harder than any man alive to see a magic eye picture, Shannon(Ben Affleck) a Fashionable Male salesman who loves nothing more than making love in the most uncomfortable place, and I don't mean the back of a Volkswagon, and Brodie's and T.S.'s significant others.

Kevin Smith makes my very short list of people I would like to spend an evening with, knocking back beers and telling amusing anecdotes.

Lee plays the character of Brodie Bruce, an avid comic book collector who is dumped by his tolerant girlfriend the same morning his friend, T.S. Quint (Jeremy London), is dumped by his. Lee is one of the funniest actors I've seen. He easily made Brodie one my top favorite Jersey characters. Pre-Armageddon Affleck plays Shannon Hamilton, owner of the Fashionable Male clothing store.

We have Jason Lee delivering some of the best gags and quotable one-liners of the era like no other actor could, we have the stunning Claire Forlani proving that she is a far superior actress than many think, we have Jay and Silent Bob, and we have enough in-jokes and trivia to keep fans occupied for many a drunken night. The plot sees Lee and London trying to win back their girlfriends via a trip to their local Mall, using a game-show as their tool for success and redemption. There we meet William, obsessed with a 'magic eye' trick everyone but him can see, Shannon, who sleeps with any woman he can get his mitts on, and various other rejects. No drunks though, or 13 year old 'can i have a fag mate?' kids who make up the majority of my local malls. Anyway, the dialogue is some of Smith's best, each character is interesting even if we only get a small glimpse of some, and the fact that this still isn't a mainstream film even after Smith's success adds an extra charming quality. 9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Jason Lee is comic genius","Date":"28 October 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Nearly a decade after it's release, this movie still cracks me up. For me, it's nostalgic watching Mallrats, as it was one of the quintessential movies my friends and I watched as we went through grades 9-12. Nothing is quite as pathetic or humorous as a couple of grown-up misfits hanging out at the mall and having no intention of growing up. Throw in a great supporting role for Stan Lee with a bellicose Ben Affleck (pre J-Lo) and you have a great film on your hands.I declare that Jason Lee has never played a funnier character than his role as Brodie. Snide, caustic, directless, yet somehow lovable, I wish Jason Lee had more roles like this. He plays a much better jerk than he plays a sap, which is what he does in such flicks like Heartbreakers, and he's generally funnier when he's being mean to other people. Though he was great in films like Chasing Amy and Almost Famous, I think Jason Lee hasn't lived up to the comedic potential that he displayed in this film.It's kind of interesting watching this flick as Kevin Smith's film career progresses (or regresses, take your pick). Jay and Silent Bob were alive and strong back then, and though they weren't the only funny characters, they certainly added a handful of unruly antics. Beautiful women are plentiful, with Clare Forlani, Joey Lauren Adams, and Shannon Dougherty (who plays such a great wench) delivering strong performances. The game show scene makes me laugh every time I watch it, I think it's hard to find better comedy than that scene (I know the old-timers will disagree with me on that).True, this movie was a box office flop, but who cares? I'd give this movie an 8 out of 10. The humor is intelligent bathroom humor, though I wouldn't rate it as an all-time comedy classic. It's just good fun and doesn't purport to be anything else, which is just fine with me.

In his first color movie, Kevin Smith introduced us to T.S. Quint(Jeremy London), college boy with his heart set on marrying his girlfriend Brandi Svenning(Claire Forlani), and Brodie Bruce(Jason Lee), comic book collector extraordinaire who hopes for a comic shop of his own. Both lose their girlfriends for different reasons. T.S. loses Brandi over her father(Michael Rooker) a sleazy maniacal TV producer determined to do anything to keep them apart, and Renee(Shannen Doherty) dumps Brodie, because she feels her life with him is stagnating, as many in their twenties in the 1990's were. Brodie decides that the solution is a trip to the mall. At this mall, we meet Willam Black(Ethan Supplee), a doofus who wants to find a hidden picture in a painting, Tricia Jones(Renee Humphries), a 15-year-old girl who has become an expert on sex using many men and young boys as her experiments. Where were girls like her when I needed them? And best of all we meet Jay and Silent Bob, those two dope-dealers who regularly hung out in front of Leonardo, New Jersey's RST Video & Quick Stop in CLERKS. Believe it or not, it is possible to be anti-drug and still find these two funny, in fact being anti-drug HELPS in that department. With a few revelations and the help of Jay, Silent Bob, Trish the Dish, T.S.'s ex-girlfriend Gwen(Joey Lauren Adams), a freaky flea market psychic(Priscilla Barnes), and even Marvel Comics mogul Stan Lee, the tale evolves into an attempt by both to win back their significant others, however while T.S. is heartbroken through the whole ordeal, Brodie pretends he couldn't care less. T.S. & Brodie are an incongruous team dedicated to making sure that young love conquers the forces of consumerism(?), and arrogance disguised as responsibility and maturity. But this is hardly another tale of innocent youth vs. evil adults, because even some of the younger cast members are villains, like the security guards serving under the dreaded LaFours(Sven-Ole Thorsen), who don't seem that much older than the heroes and heroines of this movie, Shannen Hamilton(Ben Affleck), from the Fashionable Male clothing store, and some of Jared Svenning's employees, like Rowdy Roddy(Scott Mosier!). Hamilton is a stuck-up manager who thinks he's above everybody else and that it's his duty to seduce women who break-up with their boyfriends and have sex with them in a less-than desirable position, while pummeling people at the mall with no shopping agenda, or more accurately, not the shopping agenda he wants them to have. And it just so happens that Brodie's girl is has next target. Brandi is in nowhere near the same danger, but being forced to dump her boyfriend and replace the bachelorette on her father's retread of The Dating Game, hosted by Bob Summers(real life ex-game show announcer Art James), only to have Gwen try to coax her into returning into T.S.'s arms, doesn't help her broken heart either.Like JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK three movies later, this has an incredibly triumphant ending. Mallrats has one too, but it's also a so happy you'll cry ending. It has a wonderful outcome for the two couples and their friends, a well-deserved one for that S.O.B. from Fashionable Male, and two closing themes that'll put a lump in your throat. And as for me, I'm going to find out if Marvel Comics did publish a Vulture Soliloquy, because like Brodie Bruce a lot of what was going on in the comic book industry has passed right by me, and shouldn't.

With recent criticisms for his latest film Jersey Girl, Smith appears to have created an awful movie staring the tedious Ben Affleck. Looking further into his past works however, with the exception of the mediocre Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Smith has created one or two daft but clever pieces. Arguably the finest of these is 1995's MallratsIn the second part of Kevin Smith's New Jersey trilogy, Jason Lee's Brodie and Jeremy London's T.S. have both been dumped by their girlfriends (Claire Forlani and Shannen Doherty). Seaking solice in each others company and in the company of a bunch of obscure layabouts, the two heroes spend their day lazing around the Mall and attempting to win their girlfriends back. In their way are Forlani's overprotective father, anal sex obsessive Affleck and La Fours, the ultimate Mall Security Guard. With the help of those cannabis obsessed losers, Jay and Silent Bob, Brodie and T.S. come up with a plan to defeat their enemies and win back the girls of their dreams.Mallrats is another of those types of films which can be categorised as just being in it for a laugh. With Smith's apparent favourite two characters, this film has more obscure antics from Jay and Silent Bob (Bob in particular being funny, spending his entire time attempting to master the way of the Jedi), as well as the hilarious Brodie (played brilliantly by Lee). With these three characters, the other remaining characters feel almost redundant in the laugh category.Ultimately, there is a relatively limited ammount of things to be said about this film. The cinematography is nothing amazing, the direction is mediocre, and with few exceptions the acting isn't particularly impressive. None of this matters however, with some brilliantly sick jokes and some quality moments, Mallrats is exactly what it needs to be. This film is just another of those daft, relaxing films where you can put your feet up, put on the video, and not take at all seriously. With the possible exception of Smith's other truely brilliant film, Dogma, Mallrats is arguably his finest work and a piece of cinema well worth watching.

Brodie reminds me of my ex b/f in a way, (only my ex b/f wasn't afraid of his own mom, but he did like Sega).  Brodie is fun, he's sensitive when it comes to talking about the mall.

If it weren't for Jason Lee (just a little bit less than the performance in Chasing Amy) this movie would be complete rat droppings.

Clerks. (1994) 5. Mallrats (1995) I think it safe to say that Kevin Smith, unlike a lot of movie makers, is getting better with time and experience. Big budgets help too.

This movie is great and a welcome addition to the world that Kevin Smith has created.  Instead of the wise-ass remarks from the loveable Randal, we have the great Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) ripping up the screen with his rude and crude observations.  Mallrats is fun, enjoyable, and the one Smith movie you don't have to pay attention to, to enjoy.This movie is about TS whose girlfriend breaks up with him after they get into yet another fight.  His girlfriend's father seems to have it in for him and wants nothing more than TS and his daughter to part ways.  After the breakup TS winds up at his buddy Brodie's house.  From here it begins.  Brodie will keep you laughing the rest of the way.  Jason Lee made this character and this character made the film.  Unlike in Clerks, Jay & Silent Bob have a large part in this movie.  They are in charge of helping TS get back with his girlfriend, which involves much sabotage.  There is one main storyline and a couple of other ones along the way.In all this is a great movie and who cares how it was put together.  Allot of people felt it was a big jump for Kevin Smith (writer/director, Silent Bob) and Scott Mosier (producer) to go from a small independent budget to a Studio backed million-dollar budget.

"}{"Title":"The Force Is Strong With This One","Date":"7 August 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  When it comes to being serious, this film is frivolous with it. Of all stupid comedies I have ever seen, this one takes the Lombardi Trophy. It a smattering of silliness, sageness, and suaveness and all of these elements are harmonious with one another. Mallrats is Kevin Smith's least serious film but one of the most hilarious. I recommend this movie to all fans of stupid comedy because it is not your average stupid comedy (like Dude, Where's My Car or Dumb and Dumber).Here are my reasons (spoilers) (1) The soliloquy given by Jason Lee in the first two minutes of the film is one of the funniest yet sickest stories of all time. I couldn't contain my laughter if I died trying. I taken with the movie from then on. (2) Speaking of Jason Lee, this man is the inheritor of the title of smart-a** comedian from Chevy Chase. As I heard Lee rant, I was easily reminded of Chevy Chase but with a more caustic and angry visage. If Lee finds the right comedic roles from here on out, he could be remembered as a comedic legend. He also had the best performance in the film. (3) The silliness of Mallrats is done in exquisite fashion. The characters of Jay and Silent Bob provide the needed stupidity to Jason's Lee intelligent ranting and hilarity. I love the scenes where these boys try to turn the stage into rubble while trying to take out the head security guard. That is a recipe for multiple laughs. (4) The suaveness of Mallrats comes in with the tackling of some very adult issues in a really lighthearted fashion. The aspect of a fifteen-year old female doing every man in the neighborhood for research on a manuscript detailing their shortcomings is pretty heavy and almost sadistic stuff. The film pulls some interesting punches on the issues of sexual inadequacy, drug use, youth and authority, parenting, slacking and so on without falling into preachiness. If Mallrats had gone had tried to be serious while trying to also be slapstick, it was have fallen even further away from critics and the masses alike. (5) Kevin Smith has a knack for smart and realistic dialogue. He must be an expert eavesdropper because he had to do some sort of research to hone his wordsmithing ability. It doesn't matter if that thought is correct or not because the dialogue rules either way. I have heard people quote this movie word for word and to me, it means the writer did something right. (6) Ethan Suplee's battle with the Magic Eye poster is a jewel among all comedic sequences ever made. I really loved it when he just lashed out at those who could see the sailboat while he couldn't. Even pure, raw desperation can make for hilarious moments. (7) Ben Affleck did well as the smarmy, annoying shop manager who goes after Shannen Doherty. His pre-JLO work is among his best stuff. (8) Every town that has a 'good mall' must have a 'dirt mall' and that set of scenes really hit home for me. I worked for nine months in a 'dirt mall' and it was fun. It was one hundred times cleaner than the 'dirt mall' in the film but everybody else shopped at the big mall on the south end of the city I work and play in. It made me feel nostalgic. (9) I loved the denouement of the film. That set of sequences shows that a master hand is at work. (10) That master hand belongs to Kevin Smith and he is very talented at creating films. Even at his least serious, he can make something that will make you feel good and not stupid at the same time. The true stupid comedies always make you feel this way. Ten reasons give a score of ten.Overall, Mallrats is a stupid comedy to be reckoned with. It is silly like Happy Gilmore, sage like Rushmore, and suave like Raising Arizona. It is rare to find a comedy that balances all three of these traits perfectly and Mallrats succeeds immensely. It is all right to keep your brain on here and it is also all right to turn your brain off as well because this is entertainment as it's finest. Here ends my rant!

This had the potential to be Kevin Smith's best work in my opinion, but many factors held him back.  First of all the main goal of Universal was for this film was to be a hard R film with a teen audience in mind.  They were calling it a Smart Porkys, because it had that snappy humor, but it had tits in it to attract teenage males.  Director/Writer Kevin Smith and Producer Scott Mosier wanted to make a studio film in hopes of making lots of money to fund more independent films.  Neither goal was really met, this film tanked at the box-office. It grossed only 3 million in total; meaning this film lost money with a total cost of 6 million.  This film had high hopes, all tests were good, but why was it such a dud?  Well I blame it on several factors, First of all Jim Jacks; the executive producer ruined this film.  Kevin Smith may not be the greatest director, but he is a great writer, the two set each other off making Kevin a solid filmmaker, but Jim Jacks was always holding him back by forcing Kevin to cut down on the vulgar dialog as well as graphic scenes. One scene was known as the cum in the hair joke that was later made famous in 'There's Something About Mary', but many people at universal including Jim Jacks were holding Kevin back from making the movie he wanted.  If you know Kevin's work, you will notice this is his only film where the word cock is never used.  It's just tossed around in Clerks' and common in his 3 other films.  It's that raw, real humor and language that many fans like about his writing.  Jim Jacks stressed that Potty Mouth (yes those were his words) be cut down.  Even though there is nudity, and they want that R rating, they still had to cut back on the f***s and other rude language, but that's not what really held this film back.  Gramercy Pictures, who were in charge of promoting this film, really did a poor job on making this movie known.  They used the tag line Starring Shannon Doherty and Jason Lee, someone you hate, and someone you've never even heard of. That really doesn't help promote the film in anyway.  Then they asked Kevin and Scott to think of a good poster, now Kevin and Scott didn't think of hey what would make people want to check out our movie? they wanted what would look cool on my wall?  The comic book cover poster is cool, but doesn't say much for the film, and it was the only poster made for the film. Some idiots were thrown off by it. Oh well. Also, the casting for this film was just okay, I was happy with Jason Lee as Brodie,  perfect job on that, but Jeremy London as T.S.?  Jeremy London is not that good of an actor, and just doesn't seem right for the part.  Then Claire Forlani as Brandy was okay, but I could hear that British accent coming out at times.  And then Shannon Doherty as Rene, first of all she really didn't seem thrilled to be in this movie, she never hung around the set, she would take off when she was done working.  Plus lots of people (the public) didn't like her at the time; she had a reputation as a wild one.  I think Kevin should have gone with his instinct and used Joey Lauren Adams.  I think she would have been perfect for that part.  They just barely got Jason Mewes to play Jay.  Universal didn't want jay to play jay, they wanted Seth Green or Breckin Meyer, but even they realized that Jay should be Jay, Jay is based on the way Jason Mewes really is.  I do think that Affleck was good as an asshole, but he probably could have played T.S. better than London.  Renee Humphrey as Trish was good, they almost cast Jennifer Love Hewitt instead, but she seems too cute and innocent to play that part.  Kevin Smith claims he could have made this film (probably better) with less money.  I mean look at how good 'Chasing Amy' is with a quarter million dollar budget.  Smith said that six million was just too much.  He hates losing money for people, if this movie was done with just a million dollars, it would have been just as good.  I agree.  Also, (now this is where I get a bit picky) the original opening of this film was cut, and for good reason, it sucked, it was not funny at all, nor was it even somewhat realistic.  If you watch closely, some dialog in this film is dubbed over and doesn't match the actor's mouth. This is because almost all references to that cut opening had to be cut, but it was too late to reshoot and in some instances, not possible to cut out of a scene.  This film was not a total disaster.  I believe it did pay for itself and probably profit when you include video rental where it was more popular than in theaters. Now when you take all of this into consideration, you see how great this film could have been.  Despite all of its flaws, Mallrats is still one of my favorite films, and definitely my favorite comedy.  I suggest you check it out if you liked Kevin's other work or even if you haven't, this one is probably the one that is most unlike his others.  I still give it a 10/10, but it could have been an 11.P.S. Check out the commentary on the DVD if you know about Kevin Smith and View Askew well, it's very funny to an askewniverse fan.

That's great to know.  And of course, Kevin Smith fans adore the film as well.  I happen to be one of those fans, and I always enjoy watching this movie.  It has many great lines, though in Kevin Smith tradition, sometimes he falls so much in love with his dialogue that it sometimes feels stilted.  I still love the film, but I can't deny that the dialogue doesn't always appear natural.  But at least the dialogue is intelligent, which something Smith never gets full credit for.  Critics and angry audiences spend too much time dwelling on the profane nature of his work, yet there's tons of comedies out there that are profane, but not the damn bit intelligent.  Jason Lee gives a memorable performance as Brodie.  This is the role he was born to play!  He's up there with Jason Alexander when it comes to playing the neurotic best friend.  Michael Rooker also seems to be having a lot of fun, playing a great villain.  As for Claire Forlani, I can never get over her disastrous American accent.  I'm guessing she learned from her mistakes before doing other American films like Meet Joe Black, Antitrust and Boys and Girls.  In all of those films, she seems to pull off the accent without a hitch.  I don't understand why the studio tried to cut down on the film's use of profanity.  Just another example of a**hole studio execs trying to take advantage of the independent filmmaker.  As if we don't see any studio films with strong pervasive language.  Pulp Fiction was also a Miramax film.  'Nuff said.  You know damn well these execs are prejudice against certain filmmakers.  I guess they just assume Smith is some young Neandrathal.

In fact, compared to most teen/college comedies this is very well done. It is very funny and still very dialogue-driven like all of Kevin Smith's other movies. I especially love Brodie's character (Jason Lee in his first leading role).    That being said, my biggest issue with Mallrats is that it did not quite live up to the standards that Smith set for himself a year earlier with Clerks. That movie was very character and dialogue driven and by the end of the movie I felt that I knew much more about the main characters (Dante and Randall) and that I could readily indentify with them. I did not feel that so much about Brodie and T.S. at the end of Mallrats. The only characters that I got to know somewhat were minor characters and ones that I didn't really find myself caring that much about. These include the mean-spirited and somewhat perverted Shannon Hamilton (a pre-fame and still wet-behind-the-ears Ben Affleck) and the slutty though sophisticated Trish (Renee Humphrey). It was probably a good thing that Kevin Smith gave himself two years in between this movie and Chasing Amy, in order to mature a bit. Believe me it really came through for him in the latter and his subsequent movie, Dogma.   Now despite the charatcer flaws of Mallrats, the dialogue was still every bit as sharp, witty and as outrageous as it was in Clerks. Brodie was played to perfection by Jason Lee in a role that he was born to play. He brings all of the wit, sassiness and sarcasm to his character with almost no effort. Not bad for being only his second time up to bat. Jeremy London was also very good as the slightly more cautious and more rational T.S. Quint. And of course, who can forget the unofficial stars themselves, none other than Jay and Silent Bob. Their antics really distinguish all of the movies in the series. The scenes where Silent Bob tries to fly around the mall in his cape and literally crashes in on Gwen Turner (Joey Lauren Adams) twice are very funny. Jay also provide some laughs with his foul-mouthed (and somewhat incessant) dialogue.  All in all while I don't consider it my favorite movie, it is still very well-worth it (beats the hell out of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, my least favorite of the series, but I'll hopefully let you all in on that one later). It (being Mallrats)may not be as original as the others but, if you're bored and looking for something to do, it still very lively entertainment.

Here the two find out that T.S's girlfriend is taking part in her fathers tacky dating show which is broadcasting live from the mall that they have just decided to visit.  Cue T.S to try and stop the broadcast and enlist the help of the two local stoners- Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) in an effort to gain back his girlfriend.  Also along the lines, Brodie tries to snatch his girlfriend back from the charms of Shannon Hamilton (Affleck) who likes to screw girls in a very uncomfortable place and no...not the back of a Volswagen.It is all a bit too much at first, what with the dialogue heavy storyline and.  London's performance as Quint is a bit off, but Lee is the one who ultimately shines as Brodie and makes up more than enough for London. However, overall you will probably find yourself waiting for the next short episode featuring Smith's recurring characters Jay and Silent Bob- whether they are concocting and executing plans to destroy the dating show, accosting the Easter Bunny or they are just hanging around you will find the fluid speeches of Foul Mouth Phat Buds Jay or just the reactions of Silent Bob a joy to watch and listen to.  True there are a few scenes misplaced but the film is totally enjoyable and kicks the hell out Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.Mallrats is overall a superb example of American Independant Cinema, and although it barely raked in a third of its production costs, video sales have made up for that.

The film is the next step on the way to Smith's cult status and auterism(although he hates to be called one.) In my opinion the team up of London (T.S) and Lee (Brodie) is phonominal the duo manage to pull off Smiths witty dialogue with grace and ease. Although some argue that its not as good as Clerks, Mallrats offers something different and the cameo of Stan Lee never ceases to make me giggle(even if it is the 97823th time I've watched it).

They thought it was stupid, and average at best. But, personally, I thought it was really good. I mean, it isn't the best Kevin Smith movie ever made, but definetly not the worst. I laughed so much through the movie, my eyes started watering! It was some funny stuff. I say the highlights of the movie are Jason Lee's absolutley hysterical performance as Brody and Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith as Jay and Silent Bob (one of the funniest duo's ever made). This film really isn't for people searching for a dignified plot, because it really doesn't have one. It is pretty much about two friends, T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brody (Jason Lee), who hang out at the mall during the course of one day, after being dumped by their girlfriends. There they try to win back their girlfriends. Brody tries to keep his girlfriend, Rene (Shannen Doherty) from being made love to in a very uncomfortable place by her new boyfriend (Ben Affleck) who is the manager of a classy clothing store. T.S. tries to win back his girlfriend, Brandi (Claire Forlani) because her father (Michael Rooker) made her leave him, by destroying her father's live t.v. reality show, where Brandi must choose a mystery man to date. The film has interesting and very comical dialogue and is a very fun movie by me.

"},{"Title":"Fly, fatass, fly!","Date":"13 January 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This is Kevin Smith's first `real' movie, i.e., one made with a real budget, real actors, and backed by a real studio. It was also a commercial and critical flop, most reviewers seem to regard it as his worst movie. That is understandable, seeing as he set such high expectations with `Clerks', a work of pure genius that was made on a budget so low that Smith was forced to use black & white film. `Clerks' is one of my all time favorite films, a classic that will probably still be popular many years from now, and so, by comparison, `Mallrats' simply doesn't measure up. But so what? It's still a great comedy, with lots of moments that make you want to split a gut, and is, IMHO, better than at least 90% of the other teenage/young adult movies out there.The story (as with most comedies) is pretty basic. It's about a day in the life of two slackers who both get dumped by their girlfriends that morning. They then spend the rest of the day hanging around the mall (in an ironic touch, the mall in question, while supposedly set in New Jersey, is actually about five miles from where I live, in the Minneapolis suburb Eden Prairie) trying to figure out how to win back their girls. Along the way they encounter Kevin Smith's trademark ensemble of oddball characters, most notably Jay & Silent Bob who give what I think are their funniest movie performances. Kevin Smith continues themes established in `Clerks' (and repeated in his following movies) namely, homages to Star Wars, Jaws, and hockey and throws in some new ones, most notably, comics and video games. As in `Clerks', nothing much really happens, the two, as the tagline puts it, aren't at the mall to work or to shop, they're just there. Well, not entirely. Amid their random meanderings and encounters with other Kevin Smith favorites like Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams there is an actual plot, namely, one of the guys is scheming to wreck a TV game show to be broadcast live at the mall later that day and he enlists Jay and Silent Bob to do the dirty deed. Why? Well, it's too complicated to explain in a brief review, but the payoff is hilarious. Whatever else one thinks of this movie, it has to be about the best send up of game shows ever as the dynamic duo infiltrate a Dating Game rip-off and turn the whole thing into a circus. The final 20 minutes or so of this movie is simply some of the funniest stuff you'll see anywhere.What about the rest? Mostly it's pretty good, although Kevin Smith's penchant for pushing the envelope means he sometimes goes too far when it comes to matters of taste, most notably scenes like the infamous `chocolate pretzel' and a former `Three's Company' star playing a topless fortune teller, not to mention the 15 year old girl who's doing a `science project' that involves having sex with multiple men of varying ages. Also, Smith seems to have some sort of fixation on homosexuality that keeps coming up (pardon the pun) in his movies. Is he simply using gay jokes as a means of getting a cheap laugh or is this his way of working out some personal `issues'? I don't know and, further, I don't care because I think there are better, more creative ways to get a laugh. But, these complaints aside, this movie is still funny as hell, and, as with `Clerks', Smith proves he has a good ear for tunes to accompany the film, especially in the title sequence which features all the characters drawn comic book style. Very original, and it works perfectly. One final comment I personally think the best way to watch his movies is to view them in order; this, for example, gives us the same basic slacker attitude and mentality of `Clerks', only in color and with a much bigger budget. He then went for the `quality' flick with `Chasing Amy' followed by the `issues' flick in `Dogma', finally returning to pure comedy in `Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back'. For one, the movies are all related, and each new one refers to his previous ones. Many of the jokes only make sense if you understand the context. And also, someone who saw the much more dramatic and polished `Chasing Amy' first and this film later might tend to dismiss it as sophomoric trash, not realizing that Smith got his start doing pure comedy, not romantic drama. In sum, this is a film in the tradition of `Airplane!' or `Scary Movie' in that it's all about going to any length to get a laugh, and, for the most part, it succeeds splendidly.8/10PS. As with all his other movies, Kevin Smith goes to considerable length to please his fans with his DVD's. They are all chock full of extra features, deleted scenes and the like, and his commentaries are some of the best in the movie business. Smith obviously knows he has a highly loyal fan base, and he returns that loyalty in spades.

Rather than a run-of-the-mill teen flick as the posters imply, or a weak and uneven comedy as the critics say, this is a stylish, funny and witty comedy/parody. The only problem that immediately hits the viewer is that the delivery of the dialogue is a bit stilted, but that's just the style in many of Kevin Smith's films and it just adds to the tongue-in-cheek atmosphere. The characters are all likeable charicatures and the over the top cartoony humour is a perfect antidote to the usual oh-so-sincere heartfelt nonsense in teen romance films. Mallrats is also the movie which makes best use of loveable pot-heads Jay and Silent Bob. Their small cameo appearances manage to almost steal the film as every short snippet is hilarious, rather than dragging the jokes out until they aren't funny as in Dogma. It's really hard to express how much this ISN'T a typical teen comedy in the vain of American Pie, it's almost the anti-Pie! The humour varies from wit to slapstick and the plot falls together at the end in a wonderful fantasy ending. This is also the only romantic comedy I've ever seen that appeals to guys!This is one damn funny movie and everyone should buy the video immediately.

If you'd listen to the DVD commentary, they go into detail about how Jacks made them cut dialogue or certain scenes because they were inappropriate.

Now we have the negatives out the way let me say that out of all the Smith films it has a special place in my collection ok it's no Clerks but it's funny, the dialouge and comic timing of Lee give the film a great edge and the enclosed setting of the mall and limited number of characters makes for good development of the main 6 or 7 actors.

In many ways, Mallrats is better than Clerks andarguably the best of Kevin's films(Beside Chasing Amy). BrodieBruce(Jason Lee from Almost Famous, Kissing a Fool) and TSQuint(Jeremy London, from the gallery of stoners tee-hee...) aretwo out-of-their luck college guys who decide to resolve theirromantic problems by hanging out at the Eden Prairie mall wherethey fight the local comic book store owners, Steve-Dave(BryanJohnson, writer and director of Vulgar) and Walt(Walt Flanagan,Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma), meet up with young sex-bookauthour Trish Jones(Renee Humphrey, Drawing Flies), hang outwith friend Gwen(Joey Lauren Adams, Big Daddy, Chasing Amy),and last, but not least, meet up with pot-smokers Jay(JasonMewes) and Silent Bob(Kevin Smith). What makes this film brilliantis, once again, Kevin's keen eye for dialogue. While it's not asgood as Clerks, there are some conversations that may be someof the funniest stuff put up on film. For instance, the bickeringbetween Brodie and Gil Hicks(Brian O'Halloran, Clerks, Dogma).Of course, this Kevin's 'Studio' film which was made under thename of Universal and Gramercy. One of the reasons the film isnot as succesful as it should of been is probably because of thepoor marketing by Gramercy. But, in my opinion, it's probably betterthat this film failed because it will go on to become a 'Cult' classicin some way or another. If you see this film, i suggest picking upthe mythical Mallrats Book why has cost some $300 on auctionsites.

However, was it a natural successor?The latter was a funny, witty, and original portrayal of a day in the life of a convenience store worker. It was aimed at a young adult audience and was garnished with crude remarks, that made you laugh rather then cringe. The critics seemed to lap this effort up and gave the movie, which was shot in black and white, rave reviews. This treatment was not bestowed on Mallrats.The critics were not impressed by this follow up, they saw it as an immature spawn of Clerks. Kevin Smith, in his defence, promoted the film as a dedication to the movies he used to love when he was growing up, (no not Star Wars) These mainly concerned the films created by John Hughes e.g Breakfast club, Weird science. The critics though, maintained their opinions, which caused Smith to think again and follow up with his most mature creation, Chasing Amy.Personally I really enjoyed Mallrats. It was the first Kevin Smith film that I had the pleasure to watch. I thought the characters were superbly funny, especially Brodie (played, at the time, by a little known Jason Lee) who was entertaining whenever he graced the screen. The plot, as in most comedies, was not supposed to delve into your mind and make you think about it days later, it was supposed to make you laugh, and in my opinion it succeeded.The film also introduced me to two characters who are now becoming cult icons. I am of course referring to Jay and Silent Bob (the latter played by Smith himself) These guys, apart from Jason Lee, are the funniest characters on display, I love their ongoing antics.Maybe this wasn't the natural successor to Clerks but as a stand alone film it is excellent. Just watch it, and don't worry whether it's witty enough or mature enough, just watch it and laugh.

While thinking about this comment it came to me. It lacked engaging comedic characters.In Clerks the verbal byplay between Dante and Randal kept the movie going. In Dogma the commentary and byplay from Rickman, combined with Chris Rock's work made it worth watching. Even in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back the supporting actors kept it going with clever exchanges.Chris Rock as the psychotic militant black director comes to mind.In Mallrats, outside of Jason Lee as Brodie, there really wasn't anybody that was very funny. Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith lighten things up with their usual slapstick but they are only in the movie sporadically. The other actors just play the normal Hollywood supporting cast, and dully at that. Jason Lee would make some clever comment and the rest of the cast more or less just stared at him. Having just watched Clerks again a couple of days before seeing Mallrats I really noticed the differences between them, and how much better Clerks was.It's an interesting movie in terms of watching Kevin Smith's evolving style but on it's own it stands as pretty weak compared to his other films.

In my mind Kevin Smith is a genius and his films are clever and witty, like him or not. The superb dialogue is crammed with stylish references to classics (not to mention his other work) such as the Star Wars trilogy, Jaws and the seemingly never ending superman phenomenon and lets not forget Smith's obsession with John Hughes. It's these factors that make Mallrats an instant classic which I feel never got the recognition it really deserved. If you look at the plot then ok it's not groundbreaking nor realistic however, it sets the scene for the real point of the movie which is entertainment. From the ridiculous discussion between brodie and T.S about Superman's potential heir to Jay and Silent Bob's bumbling schemes to bring about the demise of a live gameshow you can't help but think Wow I've never had that conversation, why the hell not? this leads me on to the stars of The View Askewniverse (Smiths world in which all of his films take place). Jay and Silent Bob. These two goons played by the director and his real life pal are without a doubt the funniest comedic duo that I have laid eyes on. Jay a scruffy dealer with attitude and his heteral life mate a chubby follower that utters but a sentence per film appearance, manage to steal the best lines, sequences and stunts in all of Smiths films (Maybe not chasing amy) Jay's constant vulgarisms and view on life should be enough to make anyone laugh.

The first of his films I saw was Dogma. Which I thought was very average for a director with some of the most die-hard fans I've ever seen.  Dogma had some very good segments, however, they were far too interspersed for my liking.  Then one day in the video shop I saw Clerks, so I rented it.  I was completely blown away, this was a marvellous example of independent filmmaking and was without doubt the best comedy I had seen in a long time and is without doubt his best film.  The following day I went and rented Mallrats.  I wasn't as impressed, but there were still some very good moments in the film.  However, there were also some really irritating aspects.  The acting in Mallrats is the worse than any other Kevin Smith film.  Whilst Jay's acting improved greatly from Clerks, there were some bits where he appears really amateurish, for example when the security guards are chasing him and Silent Bob, however the first shot of him and Silent Bob is brilliant.  The biggest criminal of all though has to be Michael Rooker who plays Brandi's father; I'm surprised he ever got an acting job again after this performance.  However, Jason Lee is superb in this film giving one of his best performances.  This film is really quite uneven; one minute you're on the receiving end of some of Smith's best work and the next you're wondering why you are watching this film.  However, despite this I would say there are more hits than misses and the film is quite enjoyable.  Unfortunately this film saw in the revival of the teen comedy genre and many films try to imitate Mallrats.  However, instead of copying or trying to recreate the best aspects of Mallrats, they recreate its worst aspects.  Therefore, this is far from Smith's best work and is responsible for the subsequent flood of teen comedies.  I think that if you took the quality of the Clerks script along with Randall Graves, add it to the Mallrats soundtrack with Jason Lee's performance in the film, then added the subject matter of Chasing Amy and Jay and Silent Bob's performance in Jay and Silent Bob strike back, you would have the perfect Kevin Smith film.  However, this is not Smith's worst film as Dogma definitely claims that title.  This is a very good if uneven comedy, which you will not regret renting.  Top five moments from this film 1.  Jason Lee describing the noises he makes during `whoopee'; 2.  Jason Lee's argument for why Lois Lane could never carry Clark Kent's child; 3. The introduction of Jay and Silent Bob; 4.  The fortuneteller with 3 nipples; 5. Jason Lee explaining the schematics of the mall with reference to what constitutes part of the food court.8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"A lot better than Chasing Amy or Dogma!","Date":"5 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Don't get me wrong.

Unfortunately, most great filmmakers have their occasional not-so-great films (See Oliver Stone's U-Turn or Martin Scorsese's New York, New York), and for Smith, that film is Mallrats. This movie isn't by any means horrible.  There are some very big laughs, as there always are in Smith's films.  However, Mallrats gets itself mixed up in a lame storyline and feeds the audience a number of cliches, such as the incompetent security guards and a character played by my worst enemy, Ben Affleck, who it would simply waste valuable seconds to describe.  If you've never seen a Kevin Smith film in your life, PLEASE do not start with this one.  Each one of his other films give us a much better storyline Clerks observes the lives of, need I point out, clerks in New Jersey; Chasing Amy involves a heterosexual male, who's best friend is homophobic, and who falls in love with a lesbian; Dogma, Smith's very best film, deals with Catholicism in a way that manages to be hilarious while avoiding offesniveness; and finally Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back which sends Smith's characters (played by Jason Mewes and Smith himself) on a series of adventures on their own, with great in-jokes that are especially funny if you've seen the previous Kevin Smith films.The bottom line is this If you want to see a film with a good storyline, do your best to avoid Mallrats.

First of all, you have to understand that the movie is a pothead movie.  But that is just one aspect.  Also, the style of the movie and the direction that some find awkward is supposed to be in the tradition of the John Hughes movies to which there are numerous references.  Finally, you have to understand Kevin Smith's fascination with comic books.  A lot of people think that s**** is for kids, but there is a lot of intelligence in them.  Kevin Smith purposely made a big portion of this movie like a comic book.  That is why it may seem cartoonish at times.  But that's the f-ing point.  It's not a flaw.  If anyone watches the movie, they have to at least appreciate that it is funny.

Fifteen minutes inside the mind of Kevin Smith would be a trip worth being spat onto the New Jersey Turnpike.  I'd pay good money to gain a glimpse of the world as he sees it.  The writing in the movie is really, really top notch, and every scene is filmed with a minimalist eye for comedy.  I would say that this movie is EASILY the funniest movie the man has ever filmed.  Not the greatest quite frankly, it's a little rough around the edges.  But you'll be hard-pressed to find a funnier movie on the video store shelves.Kevin Smith's movies have been maligned in the film community for many reasons.  Mallrats especially been the subject of two of the most common complaints about Smith's movies uninspired direction and flat characters. However, these claims are often untrue, and sometimes unimportant.  There may not be amazing cinematography in Mallrats, no incredible steadicam work or breathtaking pans, but let's face it folks the movie's set in a mall. For one thing, no-one wants to see sweeping panoramic views of a food court. For another thing, the movie isn't about original camera angles, it's about incredibly interesting and bizarre situations set in the most benign and uninteresting of all places.As for character complaints, while there are a great deal of characters in the film that could be easily characterized in one sentence, not only does the pace of the movie demand it but deep character development is unnecessary.  Many of the characters in the movie are examples of the kinds of people the audience members know from real life.  The geeky girl in high school is combined with the easy girl in high school this is an equation that the audience members can figure out for themselves.  The local drug dealer, some mallrat kids, the love-lorn moron, the sarcastic sidekick (sorry, Brodie), and the bad-tempered store manager are all people that most of us have run into in our lives, and we can fill in the blanks from there.At the end of it all though, Mallrats is first and foremost about the situations.  This movie may seem a little uneven at times, because the best parts of the movie are individual sequences, not the characters or the over-arcing storyline.  I list such memorable moments as the kid on the escalator.  Relationship advice from Stan The Man Lee.  A debate on the classification of the cookie stand.  Jay and Silent Bob beating up the Easter Bunny. Hartford beating Vancouver 12-2.  A deep discussion on the biology of Superman.  The entirety of Truth or Date.And, of course, anything Jason Lee says.  His portrayal of Brodie is an outstanding portrayal of the best character Kevin Smith has ever written. He's comfortable with both sarcasm and sentiment, and he has nearly all of the best lines in the movie.  All of his scenes are incredible, and he is completely at home in the asylum that is the local mall.  Jason Lee is the funniest thing about this movie, and while his acting is a little rough, so's the character, and so's the movie.  And who said you needed to be Richard Burton to deliver lines like Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned for Sega?  Not I!To review it's not cinematic art, but it's not supposed to be.  It's supposed to be strange, it's supposed to be outrageous, and it's supposed to be funny.  And it is INCREDIBLY funny.  Rent it and try not to laugh. Especially at the kid on the escalator.

Brodie is dumped by his girlfriend (Shannon Docherty) because she believes he has no future goals.

However, people who are easily offended are probably best to keep away from this film (and the rest of Kevin Smiths films, coming to think about it!)This film is most like Kevin Smith's most recent offering, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - so if you like this film I urge you to see Mallrats.Rating 8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Wow Wow Wow this is so funny","Date":"8 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This film is the best film ever - pure genius its so funny and i have seen it too many times now but it still makes me laugh evry1 shud c this film cos its so funny - kevin smith is a genius and evry1 shud recognise this buy this film - you will laff so much P "},{"Title":"Underappreciated comedy gold","Date":"28 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  A movie that was before its time and underappreciated during its theatrical release.

Not only as a wonderful piece of Kevin Smith and Company's ability to tell a story, but also an example of how to save a film from late production editing. I think this film should be required viewing for anyone thinking about entering the film industry.Anyone that has seen the 'collectors' edition of the DVD should watch the cut and re-edited scenes. From the original 'not funny' opening to the quick cover-ups (guy getting hit in the parking lot) the sheer amount of fixing that was needed before release could have easily doomed this film. I'm surprised that after 6 years, and 3 other New Jersey Trilogy films, I keep returning to Mallrats as my personal favorite.The 'fixed' story is simple enough to follow, but odd enough to have fun with. The guy versus the father of his girl, the side-kick, and of course the myriad of inhabitants of Kevin Smith's universe weave a wonderful but believable world where the audience can relax and just enjoy the simple messages of the tale.When released, Mallrats didn't meet some fans' expectations, and for that, it tends to be criticised or, even worse ignored. But to not see this film, even with it's flaws, is to deny oneself of a great opportunity to enjoy a film that is pure, unpretentious fun.Besides, it has Stan Lee in it.

Most people consider it to be the best Kevin Smith movie (though the critics and the box office don't agree), but it's bad.  It's still damn funny, but that doesn't make it good.First of all, the plot is horrible.  Now, let's look at Clerks for a second.  It had no plot, which made it get.  IT just followed two guys around.  Anything could have happened.  But Mallrats sticks itself in the side by throwing in a boring and rediculous plot.  What is it, you ask?  Two guys try to win their girl friends back.  Well, it doesn't sound that bad, but the fact the whole movie circulates around a dating game show that is taking place in a mall is sad.  It really is.  It hurts me to think that this was the best plot idea Kevin could think of.  A dating game show in a mall?  Good god that is awful.Another really bad idea was Jerremy London.  The kid can't act.  It isn't all his fault because his character is the basic straight man who's only purpose in the film is to bounce the hilarious jokes from Jason Lee.  I wish Smith had taken some more time with this character, because he sucks.Third bad point it looks and sounds like Universal just didn't care.  The music is, well, too big.  It's hard to say what I mean.  The music is really dramatic and it really doesn't fit the movie well.  There are also these weird, cartoony sound effects that come in that are just awkward.  Also, Jay's performance is a bit over the top.But, on the plus side, Mallrats is hilarious.  There are tons of funny jokes (though they sometimes aren't delevered well do to bad acting), there are some great characters (TS aside), and the witty, offensive Kevin Smith humor is all over this film.Some specific good points The magic eye guy, the escalator joke, the cookie stand speech, Jay and Silent Bob (as usual), when Brodie is on the game show, and the ending scenes (especially when Jay and Silent Bob walk off into the sunset).Overall, the movie is weak, poorly executed, and poorly acted.  It seems more like Smith's first movie than Clerks, even though it isn't.  The whole movie seems like it was made by an amateur, which is weird, because Clerks was so well made (mostly).  But, despite this, the movie is still funny.  While it is the worst Smith movie by far, it isn't the least funniest.  Chasing Amy is the least funny of all his movies (due to the second half being so dramatic) and Dogma does preach too much, but Mallrats is probably his second funniest film in my opinion, with Clerks still ranking number one.Smith's movies in order of how good they areChasing Amy,  Clerks,  Dogma,  MallratsSmith's movies in order of how funny they areClerks,  Mallrats,  Dogma,  Chasing AmyThere ya go.

I just got a DVD player about a month ago and have already gotten most of my favorite movies on DVD. I got Fight club, Chasing Amy, American Beauty (which has a crappy commentary, but that's not important), Se7en and a few others. I really wasn't planning on getting Mallrats, except for two things 1)My friend got it and told me it was a great dvd 2)this guy was selling it along with clerks on an unnamed auction internet site for less than what the clerks DVD cost and I wanted the clerks DVD.But anyway. I got it and I have to say that I now see why so many people don't like this movie. the Plot was taken out. I mean It still had its little bon mo's (Like a little French don't you), but the main plot was gone and it was here on the DVD under deleted Scenes.

Kevin Smith's follow-up to the sublime Clerks was savaged by the critics and went down like a lead balloon at the U.S box office. It didn't even get a cinematic release in Britain, where Time Out labelled it 'a depressing mess'. It is difficult to see why.True, it suffers in comparison to Clerks, but then most comedies released in the last ten years do. I also personally found some of the occasional slapstick and crudity a bit much although compared to the recent lamentable spate of Farrelly brother comedies and their ilk this seems tame indeed.The truth is that Mallrats is an enjoyable if hardly groundbreaking film, easily on a par with the much better received Chasing Amy and far superior to the diasatrous Dogma. The lack of cinema release in the U.K was in fact hardly a tragedy as (as the director freely admits) Kevin Smith's films are hardly very cinematic anyway.

But there are a few of us who love it.  I love Mallrats because it does the one thing that any comedy should do -- it makes me laugh, and often.  Kevin Smith is a gifted comedic screenwriter, and his talents are on full display here.  He displays a thorough understanding of the characters he writes, and the audience, or at least his target audience, can recognize them as people we know.  Of course the film is written with cartoonish exaggeration, but many great comedies are.  If Smith goes overboard at times in Mallrats (which he has acknowledged he did), it is a forgivable sin.  The criticism of the major players, however, is fully justified.  With the exception of Jason Lee, whom I find one of the most consistently funny actors in Hollywood today, the principals give completely wooden performances.  Nor are they aided by Smith's direction, which seems to have consisted of point and shoot.  Nevertheless, some of the smaller parts are well played, including those of Ben Affleck and Joey Adams, whose talents were put on fuller display in Chasing Amy.  Through it all, the very funny and witty screenplay shines, making Mallrats worth watching.

What sticks in my mind was the fact that Smith says he was doing a bit of an homage to the early comedies of John Landis - Blues Brothers, Animal House, etc. - and Mallrats definitely has a similar loose and anarchic feel to it.  In fact, in my opinion, Silent Bob is simply a more polite and less sexually driven version of John Belushi's Bluto from Animal House (his various hidden gifts and talents seem to come from The Peanuts' Snoopy, though).Regardless, also having been a comic book fan, a follower of John Hughes and Tim Burton movies, and having spent many an aimless adolescent day in malls or comic book stores, Mallrats appealed to me on many levels.

Let me first say Clerks is one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen. I loved it.I think I expected too much from Mallrats. Brodie's character was your typical unwashed-I-am-so-cool mid-90s slacker obsessed with video games and comics. His obsessions aren't so bad in themselves but he pays his girlfriend no attention, which may make sense but not when your girlfriend looks like Shannen Dougherty. Where does Brodie find solace? At the MALL?!?! Having grown up with a lot of Brodie's and almost having been one myself, I know that those types HATE the mall. It is almost the very living definition of what is NOT cool, especially mid-90s. The whole Mallrats concept would've been much better off set in 1985, not 1995.That aside, all of the regular Clerks-Dazed-and-Confused-Chasing-Amy crowd is here. Of course, Jay and Silent Bob are the best things about the whole movie. Ben Affleck was pretty weak, and the set up to bust him at the end of the movie is so absurd it's not funny, it's just dumb.The entire girl's father running his game show with a live feed from the local mall is horrible. The game show scene is just awful as well, except for a few funny lines.Turns out my favorite parts are the Star Wars references (in every Smith film). Smith's hosting of the Star Wars tribute on the Sci-Fi channel made me want to rent this movie that I never wanted to watch. One look was all I needed.Some of the dialogue made us laugh out loud -- usually Jay's lines. But it wasn't near enough to bring the movie up to a respectable level. Just like Dogma, this movie seemed to suffer horribly from the 3/4-of-the-way-through syndrome (I hope you know what I mean).The best part of the whole movie? The Weezer song Suzanne at the end of the film. Excellent tune. "},{"Title":"Kevin Smith's best work yet!","Date":"2 August 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Okay, I'll admit.

This movie is so funny, you will be rolling on the floor.  The now somewhat famous duo, Silent Bob and Jay, are featured in their second film, which made them more popular with the younger crowd.  Clerks is of course a classic 90's movie that deserves enough praise as it is.  But to tell you the truth, Mallrats was the first of the series that I experienced. Immediately after viewing this film I was hooked.  For about two months, I thought so highly of Kevin Smith he was like a second Speilberg.  That era of Smith praise existed until I realized that this movie was made for teens. So, I kind of covered up my obsession with these movies for a while.  But, now I'm back, and I'm ready to summarize this fabulous film.  The movie Mallrats is a great movie for countless reasons.  First of all, the dialogue in this film is superb.  Like in all Kevin Smith films, the dialogue is filled with minute, extraneous jokes that are, in the least, hilarious.  Now, Silent Bob and Jay are featured as a pair of rebellious young adults who are focused on creating pranks that will cause havoc in the large mall that is the primary setting.  Jay is a talkative, irreverent criminal like delinquent; his counterpart, on the other hand, is a silent(that is kind of implied) character who provides humor, not because of jokes or dialogue, but just because he never talks.  The plot of this movie is, although simple, provides a story that is pretty interesting.  To really understand these comments on Mallrats, see this movie.  You'll enjoy it more if you're young, but if you're old, so what.  Enjoy this hilarious and irreverent film for what it is a well-written movie that deserves praise.

They go through a menagerie of the weirdest, funny characters on their realization that they want them back, and can get them.The acting does smack of low-budget, especially Jason Lee, the Kevin Smith regular, who is nowhere near as compelling as he is as Azrael in 'Dogma'. But it doesn't matter. (A little irrelevant point of interest Renee Humphrey, who plays the 15-year old sexologist, beat Jennifer Love Hewitt for the role. A little nugget of information for ya there)On the way, the two kiddos engage in long dialogues with no cuts. This is not as distracting as it was in 'Jackie Brown', because the direction suits their rambling, yet highly eloquent, discussions. They also come into contact with more or less relevant characters, each with a huge funny character flaw or idiosyncracy. Ivanna, the topless psychic qualifies as one of strangest and funniest bit-part characters.Most of the strange little interludes, that were just funny in the beginning, come together in the climax, and this works well. The Silent Bob/Gwen unintentional stalker-love interest doesn't go anywhere, which is a little disappointing.

Why, one may ask?  Very simply, the film was too intelligent and witty for the teenage, mallrat crowd it was based around, and too low brow for the critics who were expecting an independent style comedy piece of work like Kevin Smith's previous film, Clerks. I fall somewhere in the middle, being an intelligent, wicked minded teenager, and unlike most, i ended up enjoying the movie thoroughly, the only part that seemed a bit too weird to keep in being the fortune teller with the third....well, you'll have to see the movie to know what im talking about. Kevin Smith, at heart, has a great imagination, that only gets stifled when critics expect him to churn out drama/comedies all the time. He made this movie a straight up comedy, and if you go in expecting the dark comedy that Clerks had, some of the personal experience touches and social commentary that Chasing Amy had, or some of the religious retrospect that he managed to get into Dogma without the catholic church having a contract on his head, then yes, you WILL be disappointed. Kevin Smith's little black sheep is a movie about young love, comics, shopping malls, Superman's coital habits, and sailboats. Pretend it doesn't exist if you want to, but its your loss if you cant see it in its right perspective.

Personally, I think that while this is by no means his best, it is the funniest movie Kevin Smith has made . Just because it doesn't have a pertinent message like Chasing Amy (my personal Smith fave) or Dogma doesn't mean it should be discounted. Sometimes humor should be presented just for the sake of being funny. Slight Spoiler here** It seems that (at least in his first three films) whatever Silent Bob says can be viewed as the main point the film intends to get across. In clerks it was there are a million fine-looking women out there but they don't all bring you lasagna at work. most of them just cheat on you. and in Chasing Amy there is his big long story about Amy. But in mallrats he simply says, adventure? excitement? a jedi craves not these things. ** which gives me the impression that he was just having fun with this movie, and there's nothing wrong with that. the end result is a really funny movie, nothing more, nothing less. On another note, Jason Lee's Brodie is my personal favorite Kevin Smith character, he is hysterical. All in all, extremely funny, and well worth seeing if you're in the mood for comedy.

But, of course that doesn't make it bad. To be quite blunt, I prefer Mallrats to the over-rated American Pie. Mallrats follows the adventures of the recently-dumped T.S. Quint(Jeremy London) and his slacker buddy who has also been dumped, Brodie Bruce(Jason Lee). They decide to numb their pain by going to the local mall to chill. T.S. discovers that his former girlfriend is going to be auctioned off at her father's Dating Game ripoff show, which is going to be broadcasted live at the mall. T.S. and Brodie run into Jay and Silent Bob, and enlist them to destroy the gameshow. This is where the hilarity ensues. The movie isn't as good as Clerks, but it's a helluva good ride. Complete with Easter Bunny Bashing, topless fortune telling, Stan The Man Lee, comic book, Sega, and a very obscure reference to Clerks. NOTE!! Brian O' Halloran (Dante in Clerks) shows up in the movie as Gill Hicks, an obvious relative to Dante Hicks. And don't miss the hat that T.S. picks up in the Flea Market.

I wanted to do everything at the mall. Watch a new movie? In the mall theatres. Buy a new clothe? In the mall. Eat something? In the mall. One day I was reading my TV guide when I saw a movie called Barred in The Mall, Mallrats' Brazilian name (note the Brazilian name for Beverly Hills, 90210 was Barred in The Prom!). Obviously, I wanted to watch but, I don't know why, I didn't.One year after it all my sisters started to talk about one movie named Chasing Amy Chasing Amy is the funniest movie of the world, great movie, there's a lesbian,Ben Affleck is hot... Everywhere I went there was somebody talking about this movie. And I was really interest about it because the plot is really great. I wanted to watch it but, I don't know why, I didn't.Some months ago I was reading a magazine and there was a report about the polemic Dogma. What a great movie, I thought. I must watch it. So, somehow, I have no idea, I connected Dogma with Chasing Amy and I discovered that the director and writer of both was Kevin Smith. Some months after it, I was still thinking about Dogma (you know, they're trying to cancel it here and I was very angry. They said that Alanis Morissette is a pop singer that sings naked in her shows) and reading the TV guide I found Barred in the Mall! And somehow I discovered that it was from Kevin Smith. I was happy but in fact I hadn't watched any Kevin's movie yet. That would be the test.The result is that Mallrats is a great movie. It's very very funny, different, independent, strange, everything! The cast is superb (specially Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Jason Mewes and Claire Forlani) and each new scene is better. At the end, the only thing you can do is laugh more and more (and with that end, it's impossible not to laugh). And the screenplay is for sure the best thing in Mallrats and you can see it looking at the memorable quotes. The scene where a TV-show is being made in the mall is the unforgettable. And Jay is the funniest character of the movie (and he's in Dogma, Chasing Amy and Clerks too!).Other fun thing is that many character from Mallrats are in other Kevin's movies and many actors and actresses are too but playing different characters!So, why is Mallrats the funniest movie I've ever seen only  until next week? Well, because when I was talking to one friend he said Mallrats? It's very good but Chasing Amy is better. And have you ever watched Clerks? I think it's Kevin's  best.  So I went to IMDb and Mallrats is the worst rated movie from Kevin! I can't wait. In the next weekend, I'm going to rent both. And in January 14th maybe everything will change again. Dogma will be released in Brazil!In summary, using only 6 millions dollars Kevin did the funniest movie I've seen. That proves that the most important is the screenplay, not expensive sceneries.

It seems it's unanimous here that Jason Lee is the star of this show, as he is in Chasing Amy. He has the funniest dialogue I've seen in a long time, and he takes the movie from an already funny level and elevates it to the ranks of Clerks, Dumb and Dumber, and other comedy classics.

Jay and Silent Bob are funny as ever, and the re-appearance of Dante (as a different character) as the third contestant on the game show is a nice touch.

It was semi-funny, with mostly good talent, a bigger budget, and COLOR!But the movie, overall, seemed like a waste of a bigger budget.Even Kevin Smith, the writer/director/co-star of the lukewarm follow-up to his much more genius CLERKS, thinks so.I puzzled over why, and this is what I came up withThe setting itself is way too tacky. A mall. It's much more bigger than a convenience store or video store, but with the extension of size, you expect more action. And there's not much you can do in a mall, though this movie strives to disprove that. But do we really need the villainous mall security and a hokey game show going on?Then there's Jeremy London, who does a really bad acting job as the lead. If he wasn't teamed up with the much more comedic and interesting Jason Lee, the movie would reek itself to death. Don't get me wrong, I liked Jeremy London in DAZED & CONFUSED, but here he looks like some sort of trespassing member of the  Kevin Smith Movie Club, which, I think, Jason Lee reigns here. Let's face it, he's no Ben Affleck.But the whole story is kinda crummy. Especially the whole tedious game show finale. Uggh.. there were some moments that looked like gems (the Jay & Silent Bob BATMAN parody, the Get that kid off the escalator! bit), and some that looked like a waste (the lackluster Stan Lee cameo, the fortune teller with an 'interesting deformality'). But the only thing keeping it all alive is Kevin Smith's one-of-a-kind dialogue.This is the low point of Kevin Smith's slackers in Jersey trilogy, but don't be discouraged!

While it might not be the artistically correct thing to do (go big $$$), Mallrats made his work more accessible to people who go to theaters or rent videos to have fun, not to be a critic. I know several people who were scared off by the black and white of Clerks, the lack of name power in Clerks (especially when it came out--who knew Jason Mewes before Clerks?). And these were educated movie-goers, not simps. After seeing Mallrats, they gave Clerks a try and were even more impressed. Good for Kevin, he opened the door for more people to experience his masterpiece by putting out a decent slapstick comedy. Marketing at its best. Only if he had put up a Web site telling the story of two young men who went to the mall after being dumped. Nine hours later, their ex's were found...., he would have beat the Blair Witch boys to the punch!Anyway, the movie is dominated by Jason Lee's strong performance as Brodie, and I was also happy with Ben Affleck's role as Shannon Hamilton. Jeremy London's delivery of Kevin Smith dialogue left a little to be desired, but all in all, it was pretty well done. Jay and Silent Bob were the only characters who made the movie seem overly silly. I still take great pleasure in watching these scenes 1.) Brodie's basement after the dumpings; 2.) Stinkpalm; 3.) the game show. The first time I heard Brodie's response to the whoopee question (not just the f-word, but the sounds he makes), I completely lost it.This comedy can be enjoyable.

Kevin Smith's second shot at directing, this time with a 6 million dollar budget (instead of just over $27,000 for 1994's Clerks) is what Hollywood movies should be and a lot of times aren't.  People casted this film aside like bad fruit, even a lot of the people who worked on it, but now this film is loved by many because it is a great film!  Sure there is some Hollywood sellout in the air of the film, but it's done right. The humor is raunchy, but smart and funny.  Mallrats is one of those strange treasures you don't find everyday, and has found a place in my heart (along with a slew of other people's hearts) and is one of my favorite films. The thing about this film is the characters, Kevin Smith has a way of making his characters as someone you know or can relate to, unlike most movies that come out of Hollywood.  This film isn't just an exclusive to Smith fans though...for example, my mother hated Clerks, and didn't seem to interested in Chasing Amy, but whenever I'm watching Mallrats on video or DVD, she always sits down and laughs along with me.  Jeremy London (as T.S. Quint) is the only set back to the film, his dry acting is a downer, but Jason Lee (playing Brodie Bruce) picks up London's slack, and steals the show in the process.  As always Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) are given great moments, that could make anyone cheer them on.

Mallrats possesses all of these traits, it is at times hilarious and often entertaining, and yet, seemingly through force of sheer will, it has been transformed into a fairly bad movie.On his website, Smith states that his goal was to attempt to breathe life back into the raunchy, R-rated teen comedy, and among other influences, he cites Porky's.  I state this as a warning.  And it shows what results is a movie where a third of the time you're rolling in laughter, and two-thirds of the time you're staring at the screen in a stupified trance as the central characters attempt to deal with their relationship difficulties in increasingly moronic, unfunny fashions.

"},{"Title":"Mallrats directed by Kevin Smith","Date":"31 August 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" After his assured debut, Kevin Smith followed Clerks. with Mallrats, his sophomore film, in 1995. Backed by a studio, Smith gathered his team together and made what can only be stated as a disappointing second feature. Sure it features the great writing that was present in Clerks. but at the same time the movie itself falls flat on many levels.With Clerks., Smith was unleashed on the world as a major new talent. The realistic dialogue and inventive banter between the characters made for a hilarious and engaging film, even though the production felt very much like a 'film school' project. The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into. Backed by a studio, Mallrats should have felt a lot more professional, but sadly is plagued by many of the problems that plagued Clerks. and a few other problems too. Like Clerks., Mallrats is a simple film about regular characters and takes place in few locations. This time, a mall, rather than a convenience and video store. Jeremy London and Jason Lee take the leads, and again, like Clerks. Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Smith, respectively, appear again in this film.There are some laugh out loud funny moments in this film. There is more of a story than Clerks., but not much and there is a bigger cast of characters that Smith introduces. Ben Affleck appears, in an early role, as does Michael Rooker, Shannon Doherty and Priscilla Barnes. But it is really Jason Lee who steals the movie. His performance is the saving grace to Mallrats. Take out Jason Lee and you are left with a rather childish, immature film that tries to mimic Clerks. but never really succeeds. Jason Lee is so good in this film you relish every time he is on screen. His delivery of the witty lines written by Smith is fantastic and when he's not on screen you just wish he would return. Jeremy London on the other hand, is rather weak. His performance is straight out of a television movie of the week and pales in comparison to everyone else in the film.Jay and Silent Bob are pretty good too, although overshadowed by Lee's performance, but are put in ridiculous situations that sometimes just feel stupid. Which is where the main problem with Mallrats lies. The plot points are rather immature. Smith tries to repeat the magic of Clerks., but unlike that film, which was confined to small locations, Mallrats moves throughout the mall, and not very well I might add. Ridiculous plot points, like a TV game show, feel forced and cheesy. And Smith's direction of the action that takes place within the film is too minimalistic and comes off as weak.Clerks. felt static in its direction, no movement just plain still shots that were rather bland. Mallrats adds very little to this aesthetic. While in color, and looking a hell of a lot glossier than Clerks., the camera doesn't do much to capture what is happening on the screen. One scene in particular, involving Silent Bob and a toy truck, is so poorly done it feels almost embarrassing to watch. There is no cohesion to the scene, it just feels tacky and uninvolving. Smith's direction of this and many other scenes just feels boring. So boring! Smith seems to favour a point and shoot style of filmmaking which worked fairly well with Clerks. but fails miserably in Mallrats.But that's not to say this film is boring, for it surely isn't. Smith's direction is weak, and his writing, although delivering goldmine after goldmine of hilarity,is somewhat poor when it doesn't involve a joke. The soundtrack is pretty decent, in a mid-nineties kind of way and it's fun to hear these songs, some which I haven't heard in years.What really makes this movie is Jason Lee. He stands out and feels better than the movie he is in. He is a joy to watch and whenever he is missing from the screen the movie starts to lag. He alone makes Mallrats worth watching and raises this movie to heights it otherwise doesn't deserve. Smith is great at writing dialogue, and is pretty funny as Silent Bob, but in regards to writing plot and directing action, he comes off pretty weak here.Mallrats is a somewhat disappointing follow up to Clerks., but is worth watching for Jason Lee's breakthrough performance and some truly funny dialogue.Film Rating 63%Breakdown (How Mallrats scored 63%)Production Design 7 out of 10 Cinematography 6 out of 10 Re-playability 7 out of 10 Originality 5 out of 10 Directing 5 out of 10 Editing 7 out of 10 Script 5 out of 10 Acting 7 out of 10 Sound 6 out of 10 Music 8 out of 10Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com "}{"Title":"Can it actually get worse ?","Date":"18 July 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Why does this movie have 7.1 ?

There are like 2 or 3 funny lines throughout the movie but that's it. The acting is OK, the dialogue is realistic but that doesn't help this film so much.

This whatever became Mallrats, which is basically a more expensive version of Clerks, with an added plot.From the beginning, it is clear the bigger budget hasn't tamed Smith's crude humor the movie opens with Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) talking about a sexually deranged cousin of his named Walt (who could be the same cousin Walt Randal kept mentioning in Clerks). Following this filthy introduction, we meet the main characters two slackers who are in trouble with their girlfriends. One is T.S. Quint (Jeremy London), who involuntarily caused the death of Julie Dwyer (another Clerks reference). Because of this, someone has to take Julie's place on the game show Truth or Date, and that someone happens to be his sweetheart, Brandi Svenning (Claire Forlani), whose father (Michael Rooker) created the show and also really hates T.S. Then we have the aforementioned Brodie, who gets dumped by Rene (Shannen Doherty) because he's too obsessed with comic-books and video games. In order to get over the situation, the two pals decide to hang out at the mall, only to find out that the new episode of Truth or Date is being taped there. In addition, an arrogant salesman (Ben Affleck) is desperately trying to end up in bed with Rene. Heck, if it weren't for Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), it would be a pretty lousy day.The main charm of Clerks was that its lack of plot was compensated by charismatic characters and wisecracking dialogue. This time around, there is a plot, but it's incredibly boring, mainly because most of the characters aren't that interesting. While Rooker's pantomime villain is quite enjoyable in the few scenes where he appears, the female leads are completely lifeless and devoid of anything meaningful to say, and so is London's Dante Hicks clone (not to mention Affleck, who doesn't do much else than shout and look like he's asking to be punched). Luckily, Jay and Silent Bob are as outrageously fun as ever (the latter's attempts to use the Force are exhilarating), and Lee's Randal variation is foul-mouthed and likable enough to carry the picture. Whether he's discussing Superman's reproductive habits, describing how to stinkpalm someone (arguably the film's best use of Smith's trademark un-PC writing) or chatting with idol Stan Lee (a really smart cameo, I must say), the My Name is Earl star is what moves Mallrats from dire rehash of Clerks to flawed but watchable rehash of Clerks.Overall, worth a look if you're a fan of Kevin Smith. It may be the lesser of his works, but still funnier than most other comedies out there.6,5/10 "},{"Title":"More Garbage From Smith","Date":"25 January 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" How anyone finds this tripe entertaining is beyond me.

Jason Lee (star of My Name is Earl) plays Brody and Jeremy London plays T.S. Quint, two guys who just hang out at the mall all day, because well...they have nothing better to do. This movie is definitely one of the better movies in the Kevin Smith series. I loved it because they took 2 guys, who are just like pretty much everybody else, yes, they have relationship issues, and they still live at home with their parents, and enjoy comic books and video games, but they made them 2 of the main characters. Kevin Smith stars again as Silent Bob, and of course we have Silent Bob's side-kick Jay (Jason Mewes).This movie is really funny, and it made me a huge fan of Jay and Silent Bob, oh and of course Jason Lee. I didn't really knew who Jason Lee was when I first watched this movie like over 10 years ago, but now I am definitely a HUGE fan of his. My school guidance councellor asked me what I wanted to be in the future, I didn't see geeks who hang out at the mall all day on there. Oh, by the way watch for Ethan Suplee who also stars in Earl as the magic eye guy. It's funny because like Ethan Suplee I can't seem to find the darn picture no matter what I do.So to sum it all up, it's pretty funny, it's got a great cast, there's a couple of other names in the cast, Shannon Dogherty and Joey Lauren Adams to name a few of them, oh did I mention comic book genius Stan Lee is in it as well. Yes, it's a good movie, very funny, great cast and there's a lot of laughs to be had. I don't want to spoil anything....but you got to hear Jason Lee's cat story at the beginning of the movie, and that is why I gave this movie 10 out of 10.

Both are set over one day and feature the exploits of two friends who have little hope for the future. However whilst 'Clerks' was a fairly realistic film, 'Mallrats' has much in common with 1980's teen films and sometimes comes across as a teen romantic/comedy. One scene even contains a bit of gross out humour which called to mind 'American Pie'.Despite this, 'Mallrats' is a great film that is really, really funny. Kevin Smith's flair for dialogue and characters shine here. Brodie has to be one of his greatest creations and keeps the film entertaining throughout. Even the typical cheesy romance parts keep the viewer engaged because of the humour used throughout. Ben Affleck also makes a great villain - partly because I hate his other movies so much. I still think that this is a film for people who know films by Kevin Smith. So 'Clerks' would be a good film to see before 'Mallrats'. But if your a fan there is very little that can go wrong in seeing this film. It always raises a smile whenever I think about it.

He just never goes wrong every single piece of his film making proves so much skill, talent and dedication it's unbelievable. I love the way everything ties in together with such ease and precision. There are not many films that manage have such amazing entertainment value. When I watch a Kevin Smith film I just sit their in hysterics. You see this is Clever comedy, it has class, style, edge, wit and sting. That's what I love about it, the fact it's Comedy with a bite. I never get tired of the crazy antics of intelligent slackers. Everything so real, but yet so off the wall. You get the hilarious music playing in certain moments of the film which adds a cool goofy feel to the movie. The film sticks to same cheap feel that the masterpiece Clerks. has. This gives the true Indie spirit to the film I can watch Kevin Smith films again and again, they never lose their touch. The characters are always so cool and are exactly like people I hang around with in my day to day life. The timing as usual is something I love, they way everybody seems to know their lines but have developed them to suit their preferences.Behind all the laughs there is a very serious message and that's to make the best out of the girl your dating. You see it shows that you need to put more thought in to things and understand certain aspects of relationships. Because there will always be The girl that got away. I love the respect that Kevin Smith shows to the comic book tradition and the geek factor around his films. Getting Stan Lee to have a brief stint in the movie proves this dedication and respect to the people Kevin Smith looks up to. Another obvious one is the Silent Bob Batman Sequence. As usual the scripting is the best bit about the film, it truly shines with real wit and grace. Nothing gets better than consistent quotable dialogue and the dirty speeches. That's another thing the fact the Kevin Smith is never afraid to make crude jokes and manages to make movies that have a beautiful touch of realism to them. Everything around you is exaggerated in Mallrats, the set pieces, the music, the direction and sometimes the acting. You see it's all done purposely because this is Kevin Smith's world. At first glance you might think Mallrats (and other Kevin Smith films for that matter) are dumb teen comedies. They are far from it and I always find myself stressing that point. Every character times their lines perfectly and everybody has a relaxed aura about themselves. I think a lot of people only know Smith's newer films like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and think that's what every Kevin Smith film is like. I personally feel that Clerks., Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma are masterpieces and are some of the best films ever made. One of the most underrated and ignored films of the 90s, that luckily has had a great cult status. Jason Lee acts with great talent and proves himself to be an excellent comedian. I have managed to get many friends of mine into Kevin Smith's films and they have all been impressed with his work. One of the funniest satires ever made, no doubt about it.

But for any one reading this that hasn't seen a Kevin Smith movie you, you don't really go to Kevin Smith movies for plot. You go because of characters and dialog.

Brodie, one of the 2 main characters, just the way he's presented and the witty dialog. It's just you cant not like these characters and what the characters talk about or to each other.This was Kevin Smith's 2nd film (Clerks was his first). The sad thing about Mallrats was that it did not do good at box office and did not get the best reviews way back in '95, but now it is considered to be a movie before it's time.

In fact, it's a great film. It's one of the funniest, and most entertaining pieces of cinema to come out in the 90's. So saying that it's a weak Kevin Smith movie, is basically saying that it's a hilarious movie. It follows the misadventures of two best friends, comic book addict Brodie (Jason Lee), and devoted boyfriend T.S. (Jeremy London). They are both dumped by their girlfriends on the same morning. Brodie's girlfriend, Renee (Shannon Doherty), dumps him because of his addiction to video games, comic books, and neglecting her. T.S.'s girlfriend, Brandi (Claire Forlani) dumps him because of an act of insensitivity that made her have to participate on a dating game show, hosted by her uptight dad (Michael Rooker). They end up spending a day at the mall, which is full of quirky characters, such as a 15-year-old girl who is doing research for a sex book, a topless fortune teller with three nipples, Jay (Jason Mewes), and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).That's basically the whole plot. Most of it works very well. Jay and Silent Bob are hilarious as always, and the topless psychic is one of the most hysterical scenes ever. Brodie's reaction is hilarious.

You have to admire the guy for writing dialogue so well. Kevin Smith's first movie, CLERKS was really low-budget, though MALLRATS isn't low-budget, it's not big-budget either, but either way it looks a lot better than CLERKS did. MALLRATS also has a little more plot than CLERKS did too. It starts off with T.S. Quint Jeremy London picking up his girlfriend Brandi Svenning so they can go on a trip to Florida. Unfortunately, Brandi can't go because she promised her father Michael Rooker in his best performance to date that she would be on his game show that takes place at the local mall. T.S. gets upset and she dumps him. He isn't the only one who got dumped. His best friend Brodie Bruce the great Jason Lee has also been dumped by his girlfriend Rene Mosier the beautiful Shannen Doherty. T.S. and Brodie head to the mall where Brandi's father's game show is taking place. While the stage for it is being built, T.S. and Brodie approach Jay Jason Mewes and Silent Bob Kevin Smith to see if they will destroy the stage for them. This leads Jay and Silent Bob into some hilarious attempts to destroy the stage, but sadly, they all fail. After many misadventures including a visit to a fortuane teller with three nipples, T.S. and Brodie finally get their girlfriends back and everyone is happy especially the audience. This is one of those movies that failed at the box office, but found success on video. I didn't see it on video, I saw it on television where it was horribly edited and chopped up. A few weeks later, I rented it on DVD. Since then I have rented it several more times and it continues to be my favorite flick. Teenagers are likely to enjoy it more than adults, but I guess that teenagers are the target audience for this film.

In fact, there was so much riding on this follow up to Clerks that there was talk of a sequel, Mallrats 2 Die Hard In A Mall. Alas, the film didn't do well in theaters and a Mallrats 2 never materialized (then again, the sequel to Clerks hasn't come about yet either). Film eventually found its audience on video, and provided Ben Affleck with an early film credit before he hit it big and started a good working relationship with Kevin Smith that has lasted to this day.Jason Lee also became a Smith regular after this film and made appearances in Chasing Amy, Dogma and Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back.Jason plays Brodie, a fan boy of grandiose proportions and buddy of Jeremy London's TS. TS is dumped by his girlfriend Brandi (Claire Forlani) for being obsessive and unreasonable in light of her doing her father's 70s throw back love show pilot to get him out of trouble for accidentally sending the original girl to her death via drowning. Brodie is dumped by his girlfriend Rene (Shannen Doherty) for being a loser who only plays video games, reads comic books, never takes her shopping where she wants to go and refuses to introduce her to his mother. Brodie deals with this the only way he knows how - going to the mall, which is where he spends most of his time anyway and he drags TS along with him to share in their mutual misery. There they hatch up a plan to wreck the love show so that TS can reconcile with Brandi, whom he truly loves and in fact wanted to ask her to marry him on a trip to Universal Florida that they had planned but was dashed because of the show (Brandi's dad does not like TS). Brodie also succumbs to the temptation of winning back his true love Rene, especially when he finds out that she's seeing local mall worker Ben Affleck, who has a knack for picking up women who are on the rebound from bad relationships and subjects them to his bizarre sexual fetishes (screw them in an uncomfortable place). Did I mention that Ben hates Brodie for having no shopping agenda every weekend that he comes to the mall? And to think he later played the comic book super hero Daredevil... Also along for the ride is Jay & Silent Bob in this wild and raucous romp of teen madness, so vastly superior to Clerks it should be a crime.Joey Lauren Adams, who plays one of TS's ex-girlfriends here, later had the title role in Chasing Amy.

The whiny bitch is somewhat necessary because he's like a lot of modern guys, trendy, useful and easy for most women (and employers) to put on a leash. He's probably considered handsome by most sluts (and fags (and employers)) and because of his girlfriend problem propels the plot or what little there is of it onward towards it's comically nihilistic though predictable ending.

The humour of Clerks is still here in Mallrats, but the language has been toned down a bit so that the movie receives only an MA rating instead of the R rating that Clerks received.Mallrats is similar to Clerks in that it deals with relationships. There are numerous similarities, namely that the good things are the ones that we tend to let go of. Jay and Silent Bob are here and play a much more active role, and the weird philosophical discussions, such as how Lois Lane cannot have Superman's babies because Kryptonite babies would probably kill her, are also here. One major difference though is that Mallrats is a much more expensive film and it shows. Mallrats is in colour, is set in a Mall, and has a lot of extras. Kevin Smith winds the entire movie up with a big dating game, and even has a comic book writer make a cameo appearance (which is not surprising considering this guy was probably Smith's hero).Mallrats seems to be like the Bill and Ted's movies in that way that it ends with a big extravaganza in front of a huge audience. There are antagonists in this movie as well. Le Four the security guard, and the father of an ex-girlfriend who is hosting a dating game in which he is giving away his daughter because the previous contestant died of an embolism while trying to loose weight for the show. It is also interesting that the characters are also similar. We have one loud mouthed guy who seems to have a response for everything, and a humbler guy who is more or less led around by the louder guy. This time though they are both trying to win back their girlfriends while trying to defeat the forces stopping them.Mallrats deals mainly with relationships and why they break up. It is also interesting how the comic book writer says that his worst mistake was giving up his girlfriend for the comic books. It makes us think what is important in our lives, our relationships or our material goods. This guy says that the worst mistake he made was to place material goods over relationships. Even though he had heaps of women in the future, it wasn't worth giving up a genuine relationship for. This is what makes me think because there is only one thing worth giving up a relationship for and that is God. Everybody says that women are not worth it but a true, loving relationship should be far more important than any job, or material goods. A relationship with God is worth more than anything because God wants one with us, and who is it to say no to the most powerful being in the universe. The more I think about material wealth, the more I come to see how pointless it all is.I still wonder if Kevin Smith is a Christian or not because even though he thanks God for making the movie possible, the stuff that we find in the movie is really something that would dishonour God immensely. Things like showing naked breasts and rampant sex in an elevator. Even sex with a fifteen year old girl, though that guy that does it is arrested for it. Personally I think Smith might be quite liberal in his faith, but when it comes down to it, only God knows where we are at.

It doesn't have a whole lot of plot, and is rather predictable in the end, but does deliver quite a bit of laughs. It wouldn't resonate as strongly for the viewer who isn't into the same sort of things as Smith, but in any event it works well enough, benefiting from some great lines and enthusiastic performances by all. Jeremy London and Jason Lee star as good friends T.S. and Brodie, dumped by their respective girlfriends Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty) and who subsequently spend an eventful day at the mall. Brandi's father Mr. Svenning (Michael Rooker) shoots the matchmaking game show which he produces there, Willam (Ethan Suplee) tries to vain to spot the sailboat in a picture which everybody else can see but him, characters Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) embark on a variety of schemes to sabotage the show and sneak past security guard LaFours (Sven-Ole Thorsen), Brodie mixes it up with smarmy cretin Shannon (Ben Affleck), who's now keeping company with Rene, and Brodie chances to meet comic book legend Stan Lee, who makes an ingratiating cameo. Granted, sometimes this gets pretty silly and infantile (the stink hand sequence comes to mind) and it's also undeniably crude, but Smith still creates some fun moments and keeps the action moving right along. The gals on hand (also including Joey Lauren Adams as Gwen and Renee Humphrey as Tricia) are particularly a joy to watch; Priscilla Barnes of 'Three's Company' fame has a priceless bit as a fortune teller who plies her trade while topless (and whose impressive bosom can boast an unusual characteristic). Lee has a field day playing the irrepressible Brodie, a man who's never at a loss for words.

Jersey Girl obviously doesn't count. And, much like Jackie Brown completed my Tarantino films and was about third in my list of favorites of his movie, Mallrats is the same. Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back are much funnier than Mallrats, but it's better than Chasing Amy (a romantic comedy with no laughs?) and Dogma (unfunny and insulting-and I'm Jewish). So Mallrats falls right into the middle. It's not anything groundbreaking, but there's worse ways to spend 90 minutes.T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brodie (Jason Lee) have both just been dumped by their girlfriends on the same morning. They decide to take refuge in the local mall, where various wacky events occur.I've found that all Kevin Smith movies are hit or miss, and this one does both. Unlike the other four, Mallrats has some good, very funny moments, but for the most part, I wasn't laughing. I knew this wouldn't be as outrageous as his first and last films, but I was thinking some good solid laughs would come about throughout the movie. A couple chuckles here and there, but not much. On the contrary, the movie was constantly entertaining and fun to watch. I think that's what some comedy is about entertainment more than laughs. You can relate to all the characters in one way or another. They feel almost like they're your friends. So it's basically a movie where you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy it.There are some great scenes (as to be expected from all Smith movies) here, including Willam (Ethan Suplee) trying to see a magic picture, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith in thankfully large roles) trying to destroy a stage in the mall, and a topless fortune teller (Priscilla Barnes). They're all funny. The acting in this film is surprisingly good, considering this is basically a stoner comedy. Jason Lee steals the show-again. He was basically the only good part of Dogma and saved Chasing Amy. And he's great here, too. Some of the other characters aren't really developed, but it doesn't really matter. It's just an entertaining movie overall, no more, no less.My rating 7/10Rated R for strong language, including sexual dialogue, and for some scenes of sexuality and drug content.

The story did seen sort of rushed in contrast to Clerks and many characters seemed too obscure to be actually believable. Nevertheless, the introduction of Ben Affleck in his first movie role worked very well in providing a sub plot. The movie was non stop hilarity from the outset and many fans of Kevin's viewaskew will recognise several in-movie jokes surrounding the actors. In many ways this movie is actually superior to Clerks in its dialogue and the beautifully and skillfully decorated mall in which the film is set. Smith handles the scene shots much more professionally than in Clerks and is very reminiscent of his later film Chasing Amy. Amy is a far greater film than Mallrats but that should not stop you from buying this film either as it will still soon become a treasured possession of your film collection and you will be quoting the characters for months afterwards.

So if anyone cares for more detail feel free to check that out as well. Similar to Clerks, I liked Mallrats a little more. Like Clerks, this is a film about losers. Unlike Clerks, Mallrats has a plot but no point. Since Mallrat's characters are losers, we have a plot that deserve them . . . a really vague and stupid one. But that's good because do you really want a mall rat and his pal to save the world in a Tolkien setting? Though what puts this film over Clerks in my mind is Jay and Silent Bob's expanded role, and the expanded zanyness (even though I liked Jay better in Clerks and feel he's turned annoying since Mall rats). The Star Wars references, Loony Toons . . . good for a laugh, and Jay/S.Bob fill that role of comic relief. And of course, Kevin's Smiths talent for making his characters say what many of us dream about saying in given settings. In Clerks, Randal voiced the opinion of thousands of store personnel everywhere.In Mallrats, we finally get to see one of those Let's Make A Date shows with a real contestant.If nothing else bear with the film for its ending, and don't expect an epic climax of an 'Oscar-worthy' drama . . . Mallrats is above that and does things its own way, mocking the epics as it goes along. A fun ride, but far from mindless.

You know, the main character goes to the window, sighs, puts one hand on the sill, and you know that there's grief and loss.Not in this film. Instead, a dating TV game show is used as a metaphor for dating and love, and the whole thing is made explicit. It's a hilarious turn-around and there's plenty of commentary on life (deep but mostly non-deep). The acting is good, the plot has plenty of clever twists, and unlike the awful Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the movie fits together as a whole (not a bunch of stupid disconnected skits).Who should see this film-- comedy lovers who won't mind the swearing and want to check out what a cult film is like.-- cult film lovers, you know who you are, a must-see-- foul mouthed post-adolescents who can't get laidI'll give Mallrats a classic but not Star Wars kind of classic 8 out of 10.

These two guys just have had one sh.tty morning and decide to go to the mall, where they see a chance of getting even with the guys that sc..wed up their life and take up where they left. Brody is really extremely an extremely cool / sick dude in this film about nothing. He is like so gross like forget American Pie. Just listen him explain to his friend why he thinks his girlfriend left him or see him do his &#145;Stinkpalm'. This is one seriously fu..ed up dude, dude. Also watch him on the show. BRODY FREAKING RULES!!! So do Silent Bob and Jay though. OK I admit they are basket cases but they are cool. Especially Silent Bob I think. OK he don't talk too much but he's so cool with mimics and s..t that it makes him better than Jay. Last but not least I must comment on the chicks in this film. None of which seems to be remotely Normal. I mean except probably Claire Forlani.

Despite being 'vulgar' as critics described it, it never seems to be all out offensive, instead just coming across as it should, just being there to make you laugh. The great atmosphere of the film is created through the feeling Smith puts into his movies. Each character is a part of the fun, especially Smith's alter ego and on screen persona 'Silent Bob' and his partner 'Jay', the two ever present heroes of every Smith film, whose supporting parts are just soooo funny. The cast is Smith's regular group of great actors, the stand outs being the champion skate boarder turned actor in his first film, Jason Lee, as Brodie, Jeremy London as T.S, Shannon Doherty, and great performances from Ben Affleck and STAN LEE, the legendary comic book creator.

Jumping directly to his painful lover Holden in 'Chasing Amy' makes you really appreciate his skill.  And of course, he's wonderful to gaze at, as is the more obvious Jason Lee.  I love how both Jasons dance around in all their movies.So what if this one has ups and downs!!

Did you notice there was absolutely zilch parental guidance of any positive kind in these movies?  Why are parents so completely null when our kids become adolescent?  Why are people whose parents DO dominate their lives so absolute zeros?  'Mallrats' was kind of about nothing, which beautifully illustrates what modern life for some teen-agers is all about 'nothing' but lust.

It wasn't as good as CLERKS, but it was fun.  And I thought that CHASING AMY was better than MALLRATS, I didn't hate MALLRATS any more, I just saw them as two different comedies.  But just recently, I bought the MALLRATS collector's edition on DVD, and it made me look at Smith's misunderstood classic in a different way.  Even after listening to the wonderful commentary by Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, Jason Lee, and Ben Affleck, I realized what Kevin Smith was trying to make a tribute to the classic 1978 film ANIMAL HOUSE. If you think about it, it makes sense.  Jay and Silent Bob are Bluto and D-Day, Brodie and J.T. are Boon and Otter, and Mr. Svenning and Hamilton are Dean Wormer and Marmalard.  This is Smith's personal tribute to the slobs of America, they don't party, they just hang out at the mall.  And now I see this film in a different way, and I enjoy it more.Also on the DVD, there are over an hour of deleted scenes, some are pretty long and slow, but others are funny.  It also includes one of the original plot lines of J.T. (hint he accidently does something to a powerful political figure) and thus causing many changes to the theaterical release of the film, and taking out some good jokes.  I can understand why Smith took it out, but I'm glad that he included it on the DVD set. MALLRATS Collector's Edition is one of the many and many reasons on why one should get a DVD player.  For under $30, you get so much information and details on the movie, as well as discovering some hidden secrets on the film, some other choices Smith had in case Stan Lee didn't want to the film (Mr. Quentin Tarantino was a considered choice), and who Gramercy wanted to play the character of Jay (Seth Green was a considered choice). Overall, if you enjoy Kevin Smith's MALLRATS or any of his other two (soon to be three) films, then I would highly recommend that you buy this DVD.  If you don't have a DVD player, then save your money, and get one, then get this disc.

After around a decade, a fine line emerges between a movie capturing an enduring snapshot of a particular period's culture, and having references become dated to the point of unwatchability. Stumbling across Mallrats on HBO this past week, I was reminded that the movie falls solidly into the former camp. Mallrats captures the teenage culture of the early-nineties like few other movies- a still pre-internet, pre-cell phone time when bored kids had to congregate at the local mall for social interaction. Mallrats is delightfully peppered with now largely forgotten nineties elements magic eye pictures, Shannon Doherty at her hottest, VCR's, men with shoulder length hair, a dating game, and even a pre-J Lo Ben Affleck.The straight-forward structure of the Mallrats plot provides an effective platform for the character interaction that makes the movie. The story centers around two friends, TS and Brodie (Jeremy London and Jason Lee), who head to the mall to try to drown their sorrows in the smell of commerce after both being dumped in the first 10 minutes of the movie. TS's plot to hijack his ex-girlfriend's dating show allows for a series of Wile E. Coyote inspired attempts by Jay and Silent Bob (the same characters from Clerks), aimed at overcoming the head of mall security and destroying the gameshow's set. The middle body of the film consists of these antics along with TS and Brodie generally wasting time at the mall with entertainingly arbitrary discussions. Events build towards the friends finding the resolve to reclaim their women.Despite its endearing traits, the movie is not without weaknesses. TS and his ex-girlfriend Brandi (played by Claire Forlani) bring little to the table but bad acting and awkward dialog. TS (London), though supposedly the main character, is generally off-putting and hard to root for. Also, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), while entertaining, are not at their best. The fact that the studio reportedly made Kevin Smith tone down some of the vulgar dialog probably accounts for Jason Mewes's inability to shine.However, there is plenty in Mallrats to make up for its shortcomings. Ben Affleck brings more than enough firepower to his role as a typical cocky Jersey mall salesman (I have no respect for people with no shopping agenda), trying to take advantage of Brodie's ex-girlfriend (in a very uncomfortable place), and Michael Rooking provides an effective villain, playing TS's girlfriend's father, who spends the movie trying to keep TS away from his daughter.More than anything, though, Jason Lee (Brodie) steals the movie. He dominates every scene he is in with some of the most incisively random dialog in recent decades. From loudly complaining about negligent parents allowing a kid to play on the mall escalator (who later gets caught in it), to saving the ending dating game show with lines like his insistence that he be called the second suitor rather than suitor number two, Lee puts forward what should be considered one of the iconic comedy performances of the nineties. His barrage of mini-monologues and one-liners are by far the most memorable part of the movie, never better than when he adamantly argues with TS that the mall cookie stand is not part of the food court but that it should be classified as as an autonomous unit for mid-mall snacking.It had been at least 10 years since I'd seen Mallrats, and I couldn't have been happier to rediscover it. If you're looking for a trip down nineties memory lane and an hour and a half of laugh out loud comedy (mostly provided by Jason Lee), than Mallrats is well worth dusting off.

And it is really sad when the best acting job is done by Shannon Doherty.  Don't get me wrong this was an enjoyable movie but I have seen many other good comedies.Jay and Silent Bob were very funny but I have never liked Jason Lee or Ben Affleck, neither is a particularly good actor and here they have few good lines.  The highlight of the movie is an appearance by Stan Lee who is the creator of the Spiderman, X-men and other comic strips.  He is very funny. The plot centers around a group of people that hang around a mall all day, hence the term Mallrats.  Jason Lee and Jeremy London are two lazy young men that have recently lost their girlfriends and are depressed.  They actually did very little with their girlfriends. London lost his girl because her dad wanted her to appear on his game show instead of going to Florida with him.The movie has a lot of satirical elements.  There is a takeoff on The Dating Game, Star Wars, Looney tunes, Batman and much more.  Perhaps that is the problem there is too many spoofs of other shows and movies and not enough jokes they come up with on their own.  The movie does make a lot of fun of the whole mall culture and people who hang out there too much. I think I would recommend this movie to teenagers mostly.  It was mostly forgettable to me.

One example is the opening narration that serves as a prologue to the film in which Jason Lee's character asks why his cousin keeps buying kittens which keep getting stuck up his ass, to which the cousin replies how else am I supposed to get the gerbil out? I also liked the style of the film more than Clerks. Yes, much of the film is static like Clerks, and even the Steadicam shots are very steady, but there's still a lot of cool things going on here with Kevin Smith's directing.Of course the review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the great, hilarious performances by Jeremy London, Jason Lee, a young Ben Affleck, Ethan Suplee, and of course Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith as Jay and Silent Bob, who I actually found to be at their most likable in Mallrats (I especially liked the bits detailing their plans to thwart the evil mall cop La Fours and how they execute them).The only criticism of the film I have is that the romantic element of the film gets a bit too cheesy for me at times, but the movie isn't supposed to be like Chasing Amy where romantic realism is put face first, it's supposed to be a fast paced comedy, so of course not as much effort went into the romance as the rest of the film. But this doesn't really depreciate the value of the movie, just sort of weighs it down.Regardless, I believe that if people can loosen their hold and focus on realism for an hour and a half that Mallrats is a very enjoyable film and definitely worth a watch.

I happen to adore Clerks, it is one of my favorite films ever and certainly up there with a rare few with being one of the all time best teen movies.Mallrats, while maybe mildly entertaining, can't touch the classic wit and brilliance that is Clerks. I actually thought Mall Rats was more obnoxious then funny and though I know this movie is very appealing to some, I just never got it.When I saw Mallrats, it was tough for me to watch to the end. The problem is the movie is meandering in a way Clerks was not, both movies capture day to day life, that's what I love about Smith, that he's able to do that. But even if there had never been a movie called Clerks, Mallrats struck me as being like a million other movies out there and while I can relate to hangin at the mall as a teen, the characters, as many have stated on this board were just majorly obnoxious. Again, in Clerks, any obnoxiousness the characters or movie had was overcome by the hilarious but always intelligent humor. With Mallrats, it's just another teen movie.(LOL.) It didn't linger in my mind afterward and dragged a lot while it was on. Just wasn't into it.Perhaps I was spoiled by the greatness of Clerks(a movie I've seen so many times I have lost count.) But even if this hadn't been Smith who brought us Mallrats-I just didn't care for this. I wish there would have been better dialog, less rambling, more charm and genuine wit and have some more twists and turns.

Some might go as far to say as it is not as high to standards as his last pictures (and sadly I slightly agree), but that still doesn't matter with Smith at the helm.  In fact, he can be better at writer/director/Silent Bob than any other one in America when he tries hard enough.  The film circles on 2 slackers at a mall where they hang out (Jay and Silent Bob also preside with Jedi powers) who want to get their girlfriends back after they dumped them.  Their escapades in one day is similar to Clerks without the black and white, but by no means is it better than Clerks.  I wish it was, but it doesn't grab you as much as Clerks did.  Still, Mallrats is a cool, hilarious comedy that is great for parties, or sick days.

If you are wondering why that is I truly believe it is because it was simply ahead of its time. Visually mallrats isn't much to look at but if you are aware of Kevin smiths work you know that he generally does two angle still shots. So instead of capturing you visually he does comically. Imediatly when the film starts you are told a hilarious story told by Jason lee and all thought i do not want to ruin it i will say it is one of my personal favorite scenes. Also aside from the comedy this film has a very real feel to it and a decent plot. I recommend purchasing the mallrats 10th anniversary extended edition because it has both the theatrical and extended versions of the film. And a wide variety of special features including cast interviews from the original set, a brief Q and A with Kevin smith, out takes, viewaskews look back at mallrats, the erection of an epic-the making of mallrats, mallrats reunion, a great feature commentary with Kevin smith Jason lee and Ben affleck, and much more! So if you are a real movie buff like my self or just a view askew fan i recommend this film for you. You can pick it up for just about ten bucks and you really are getting your moneys worth with this one. This film is a must have for any movie collection.

The Weinsteins certainly deserve Guantanamo for hyping this sort of self-indulging manure. And the IMDb rating for this anal regressive bomb would seem to indicate that a long, dry fart in a mall will do for most American publics.If anything, Smith is the Osama bin Laden of film.Run for cover!

However, in comparison to his previous work, Clerks, and  the immediate sequel, Chasing Amy, Mallrats seems, to me, to be too  Hollywood. That is, the independent flair which permeates the other films  from Smith's Jersey Trilogy is noticeably missing. That is not to say  Mallrats sucks. To the contrary. I only mean to say that this is a good  film, but one that pales in comparison with the director's other works.  "}]
