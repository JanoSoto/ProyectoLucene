[{"Title":"An Actress Comes of Age","Date":"31 July 2003","Score":"43 out of 57 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Here in The Last Time I Saw Paris an interesting thing happens. Elizabeth Taylor becomes a woman. Before this picture there were really only two other outstanding performances by Miss Taylor. Or I should say where she was allowed to rise above the material. The first being of course the rhapsodic National Velvet and the second the astonishing A Place In The Sun. The films in between those and The Last Time I Saw Paris were mostly along the  `Isn't she beautiful?' line of movie making, and, why not?  That was the main engine of most Hollywood star vehicles of the day.  A Star didn't have to be a talent. But it was essential to possess a presence that reached out from the screen and touched the audience in a primal way. Miss Taylor had that in spades but she had much more that was often eclipsed in the dazzling explosion of her extraordinary almost alien beauty.     But here in the hands of director Richard Brooks (who would later lead her to her triumph in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof) Miss Taylor finds a new level in her abilities as an actress.  Her Helen is a woman of many layers and dark corners, of mercurial flights and deep sadness.  Elizabeth at the tender age of 22 grasps all the aspects of this tragic woman and illuminates not only the screen with them but the whole enterprise as well.  She shows us where she, as an actress is going in the future. And who she will become in her later films, one of the best screen actresses of the twentieth century.  This is the real beginning of the Elizabeth Taylor of legend. She fills the role as no one of her generation could. Never again after this film would she sleepwalk through a film, a beautiful shadow to dream over.   She is aided in what is perhaps one of Van Johnson's best performances. Donna Reed scores high in the role of Helen's bitter sister and Walter Pidgon is a delight as her roguish father. A standout cameo is presented by Eva Gabor, (not Zsa Zsa) the only one of the famous sisters who had any real talent. The only false performance in the film comes from child actress Sandy Descher. When you compare her forced and overly cute performance to that of the child Elizabeth Taylor in `Jane Eyre' then you see what a treasure Miss Taylor has always been.    There is something so essentially wonderful in this gem from MGM and it is this. The Last Time I Saw Pairs is the perfect example of the last flowering in the 50's of the `woman's picture'.  Films where women could be multi faceted and complex and drive the story on under their own steam as whole human beings.    This is a window to the 50's and a style of filmmaking that seems gone forever, great stories of strong women who fill the screen with power and grace.  But with `Far From Heaven' and `The Hours' I may be wrong about forever.    I recommend this admittedly dated but charming film for anyone who wants to see what screen acting is all about. It is about thinking and Miss Taylor is a master at the craft.

Scott Fitzgerald's Babylon Revisited from the jazz-age Paris of the `Lost Generation' to the late 1940s and early 1950s looks logical enough, one World War being much like another, but a certain piquant period flavor gets lost.  The madcap behaviors and post-Victorian motivations that made sense in the age of corset-free flappers and expatriate wastrels seem dated in the more efficient, streamlined age of jet travel.  The way the characters ruminate about life back home in the United States, you'd think they'd colonized Mars rather than taken lodgings near the Eiffel Tower.Amid the city-wide orgy of V-E Day, Army correspondent Van Johnson meets two sisters  Donna Reed, who gives him the eye, and Elizabeth Taylor, who catches his.  Their happy-go-lucky father (Walter Pidgeon) isn't rich but lives like it (`It's cheaper that way,' Taylor explains).  Taylor and Johnson marry, have a daughter, and party in an upper-crust social whirl, while he types out multiple drafts of The Great American Novel.  How they (or Pidgeon) can afford their high life goes unmentioned, and when they suddenly come into money, thanks to some Texas oil wells that start gushing, there's little detectable change in the texture of their lives.Except for disaffection.  Johnson drinks more heavily as the rejection slips pile up (Pidgeon advises him that the secret to success is mediocrity). Taylor starts ditching the kid at bistros while she's off jumping into fountains.  Three sheets to the wind, Johnson speeds off in his sports-car with Eva Gabor riding shotgun, but his reckless driving comes to naught (twice).  Both partners play at adultery but never actually engage in it.  Occasionally Reed, a frosty smile frozen on her face, pops up to register her smouldering resentment against Johnson.  But then Taylor, of such delicate constitution that she has been known to contract &#145;flu not from microbes but from a gentle rain, gets soaked to the skin when she's locked out of the house at dawn and slogs her way through the slush...Given these melodramatic excesses, Richard Brooks keeps the movie refreshingly low-key; he draws a subdued and affecting performance from Taylor (at the dizzying pinnacle of her young beauty).  There are some missteps (Johnson having a drunken argument with himself; Roger Moore as a tennis-pro gigolo; a comfy wrap-up that comes off as forced and abrupt), but Brooks keeps the proceedings passably watchable. This heady, romanticized peek into the life of Americans abroad has its allure, and, though you don't believe it for a minute, it makes you want to sip a Pastis and light up a Gitane.

What a difference in four years from The Big Hangover where Johnson was billed ahead of Taylor. Which is odd in this case because the film is really about Johnson. It's based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's story, Babylon Revisited which takes place in Paris after World War I. MGM apparently thinking that the audience would be more amenable to a story taking place after World War II, so the plot was updated for France of the Fourth Republic.It doesn't quite work though, France of that era was a whole lot different than France of the Roaring Twenties. They partied then also when Paris was liberated and the Germans chased out of their country, but on the whole it was a time for more sober reflection of what France's role in the post war world would be. The Roaring Twenties that Fitzgerald wrote about were not the Roaring Forties.Van Johnson is a GI who comes upon a family of expatriates who lived in Paris right through the occupation. Walter Pidgeon and his two daughters, Donna Reed and Elizabeth Taylor. They both are interested, but Johnson has eyes only for Liz. And the film is their story.It's a tragic story, you can see Fitzgerald himself in Van Johnson, the would be writer who becomes a dissolute playboy. Partying right along with him is Taylor who is the image of Fitzgerald's party girl wife Zelda. MGM did this one on the cheap. There are some shots of Paris, but on the whole the Paris you see is the Paris that was created by the studio for their classic musical An American in Paris. View the films side by side and you'll have no doubt. Look for Eva Gabor as a divorc√©e who likes Johnson and a very young Roger Moore as a tennis pro who'd like to be a kept man by Taylor.It's a nice story, but it could have been a whole lot better if MGM had actually shot the film in Paris completely and really set in the period it was written.

The film has indeed been bashed, here on this database among other places, as unimportant and unworthy of your time as a possible rental choice.I disagree completely with the uncalled for bashing, and with the judgement that the movie is unworthy of your time. See it for yourself. And if you are young enough to be completely unfamiliar with all of the actors, so much the better for you to judge it fairly on its merits rather than be snowed by the reputations of Hollywood personalities.The plot has depth and very few weaknesses, the acting is good to very good, and the story has interest value in both historical and social frames of reference.The plot concerns the uniting of two people whose tragic flaws are not well matched, with the obligatory tragic results. The pair gets together spinning out of a near-miss love triangle. The man (Van Johnson) has no idea of the existence of the triangle, as he is completely taken with Taylor and just as completely forgets his earlier attraction to the other woman (Donna Reed). Reed, the rejected third wheel, is actually not rejected, per se, but becomes the odd man out none the less when her sister (Liz Taylor) successfully steers the affections of the duped Johnson in her own direction instead.Reed adopts the persona of the rejected party to a relationship that never was, and exacts her revenge later in the film.While the big name actors of the day are no longer influencing moviegoers today, they undoubtedly sold the film in 1954. I find some weaknesses in both acting and directing, but the film is definitely worth seeing if you have never had the pleasure. Van Johnson's role is that of a fairly shallow character with a good heart but no follow-through to carry him to victory until way too late to do much good. Johnson possibly could have done more with the role, but the weakness of the character should not be confused with some partially perceived weakness in Johnson's delivery of the part.Taylor does a nice job as the sly and experienced older sister, the one with the better looks and the Machiavellian technique to get whatever she wants, again at the expense of little sister Reed. The film is actually carried more by the acting of the supporting cast than by the efforts of the leads. Two very strong performances are put forth by Walter Pidgeon and George Dolenz. Pidgeon plays the opportunistic pretender to wealth and father of the two women. Dolenz is the earnest lover of Reed, who inherits her full-time attentions only after Johnson is fully occupied with Taylor. Dolenz marries Reed and in the end does a very nice job of becoming the film's heroic figure.Eva Gabor at the peak of her youthful beauty does a good job as yet another love triangle component for the easily side-tracked Johnson after his marriage to Taylor. Another triangle develops with a very young Roger Moore finding the eye of Taylor.Do yourself a favor and see this movie.Dan Cooper is a freelance writer/editor. He has been writing for over 30 years and has done book and movie reviews sporadically since the 1970's.

His limited talent does not include the ability to portray a writer, much less one who struggles with intellectual despair.  The second and more serious flaw is the movie's ending.  The happy ending constructed for the movie is completely out of line with the story's point of view and makes no sense for the motivations of all the characters as written by Fitzgerald or adapted by the screenwriter.

Basically you have a pleasingly low-key performance by Van Johnson as a hard-working American G.I. who decides to stay in Paris, under the spell of a lovely bohemian (Liz Taylor) and her anti-pragmatic father (Walter Pidgeon), but his performance eventually veers too deeply into the maudlin as we're expected to believe that his inability to write a successful novel has brought about an existential crisis for the protagonist as well as a marriage crisis for the couple.The most irritating thing about the movie is the way that the writers tried so hard to make sure that the audience wouldn't blame either of the lovers for any of the bad things that are happening, all the while expecting us to buy that each lover blames the other at least at one point or another. That makes me suspect more than anything that some radical changes must have been made to F. Scott Fitzgerald's original story.It's even hard to say if the film has any visual beauty to compensate for the lack of believable characters, at least on the DVD I saw (where it was coupled with Father's Little Dividend) the colors were very faded and there were visible scratch lines and so forth indicating that this DVD was made from a print and not a negative. So I couldn't possibly take away or add any credit to the film because of photography because it's very hard to judge the quality of the images. However I found the directing in general to be good with regards to the actors' performances but pretty nondescript in terms of visual sensibilities.

Elizabeth Taylor is the standout in a good cast, with Van Johnson also getting some good scenes. The postwar Paris setting is used in a number of well-conceived ways in the story.Johnson plays the main character, a reporter and would-be novelist who begins the movie with a trip back to Paris, and begins reminiscing about the past. The character's career disappointments and family crises give much of the story a markedly pessimistic (if not depressing) tone, yet Johnson plays the part believably, and the story brings out some worthwhile thoughts, as his character gradually loses his perspective on things.As his wife, Taylor's appeal and energy stand out every time she is on screen, but more importantly, she develops the character consistently throughout the story, often in interesting contrast to Johnson's character. She starts out as a rather spoiled, fun-loving young woman, then gradually takes on more depth and character. Her performance adds considerable meaning to the rest of the movie, and it also help in making the other characters more believable.Walter_Pidgeon (sorry, otherwise can't get it past the spell-checker) seems to be having fun as the easygoing father, and Donna Reed does a solid job in a rather thankless role as Taylor's more serious, sometimes envious sister. Eva Gabor and a young Roger Moore play characters who are one-dimensional yet important to the plot.Overall, everything works pretty well. The pace is just a bit slow at times, which occasionally makes for heavy going during the sadder stretches. But these always have a point, and as a whole it is a worthwhile drama with some interesting characters.

Other reviewers have analyzed Ms. Taylor's performance, and she does quite well; her father is portrayed by Walter Pigeon as a shallow lothario, Donna Reed is the angelic sister, and Van Johnson the writer/husband. While I agree with a previous review that the persona of F.

The moods and cinemascope coloring from 1954 are classic. We do not see such subtlety today. The incidental music is also haunting. Highly recommended, especially if you love Paris.

After all, the first 80% of it is very good--with nice acting and a very compelling story. Then, oddly, the last portion of the movie seems to fall apart and is a bit of a confusing and saccharine-like mess.The film begins with Van Johnson meeting and falling in love with Elizabeth Taylor. Considering how incredibly beautiful and sweet she was, it was easy to see why he dumped Donna Reed to pursue Taylor. Johnson's ambition it to publish a novel, but in the meantime he has married Taylor, has a lovely little girl and a well-paying job in Paris. What more could he want? Sure, his book has been rejected by some publishers, but considering everything he is still clearly a lucky man. But Johnson is NOT happy and is a self=indulgent idiot (to put it mildly). All he can do is feel sorry for himself for not being published. To bruise his shallow ego, he begins taking Taylor for granted and spends way too much time with his new friend--sultry Eva Gabor. Gabor is NOT the 'just friends' type, as she's been married multiple times. How any sane man could chose her over the sweet wife is beyond me and you really, really hate Johnson's character--a big switch for the guy who usually played such likable guys.All of this drama was compelling and I really got into the film--and wondered why the film had a mediocre score on IMDb. But then, late in the film, I saw exactly what the problem was. The film began to make no sense at all and decided to use clich√©s instead of decent writing. Out of the blue, Johnson locks Taylor out of the house and it's raining. In the real world, she'd get mad but that's all. Here in this Bizarro World, instead she gets sick and dies!!!! Folks, in real life standing in the rain does NOT cause death! And how she died with him rushing to her and having her die in his arms was dreadfully schmaltzy and stupid. And, what happened next was worse. Not one minute of the last portion of the film rang true or made sense. Considering that Johnson was cheating on his wife and locked the wife out in the rain, you'd THINK Taylor's father (Walter Pidgeon) would be at least a tiny bit angry--but he wasn't!! And, when Johnson CONTINUES to feel sorry for himself and neglects his daughter (necessitating her being cared for by others), you think this guy is a total bum--and yet they have them reunite at the end of the film and there's a 100% phony Hollywood ending!!! The first portion of the film I give a 9--it's that good. The last, I'd give a 2 or a 3--at best. An overall score of 5 seems reasonable as the actors do a nice job with a bubble-headed script--but frankly, the end just ruins the film for me.

I asked myself while watching though,why would a free spirit like her want to tie herself down with an overly-serious person like Van Johnson's character? I'm not saying he doesn't show emotion but sharing a kiss on the street hardly seems a plausible way for two to fall in love with each other.

Her still carrying on as if she weren't married. His friendship with Eva Gabor making her (Taylor) jealous for no good reason. His alcoholism and (what we're clued into in the first scene of the movie) her untimely demise from pneumonia. Quite the soap opera.I found Taylor's character dying from this to be a bit ridiculous. Okay,she got locked out and caught in the rain and the cold with snow on the ground. She gets to her sister's place soaking wet and passes out. Now,why not just get her upstairs and into a hot bath for Pete's sake?!Any believability the film had before that went out the window for me and after her character is gone,the only thing one is left with is Johnson's character getting his daughter back from Donna Reed. I couldn't stand her character at all for she seems to hate Van Johnson's character without good reason,though she has one later.I will admit when it comes to scenes of parents and kids,I do get sentimental & a little emotional but then seeing Johnson & daughter reunited is a wonderful touching end to the film. One laughable scene in the movie is when Johnson & Gabor are in the Monte Carlo car race and they skid in the rain into a wooden fence. The skidding is clearly a stock-recorded sound effect,that sounds like it's from a Warner Brothers cartoon!I rate five stars for the above listed reasons,the acting is good here but some aspects are just too unbelievable to accept.

Aside from Johnson making his character a big baby, I could follow most of it with my disbelief suspended. This role calls for someone who 1) is loveable, 2) is a rake, 3) is a believeable drunk, 4) is physically at least half as attractive as Taylor, and lastly, 5) can act worth a damn. Needless to say, the person they chose fits none of these characteristics. William Holden would have been perfect in this role.

No 2 reviews are alike. This speaks volumes as to how the film actually affects those who see it. The viewers take away vastly different aspects of the film to discuss.The opinion this reviewer has is that the film is not as drudgingly long as some reviewers have noted. Also, while Van Johnson is always a bit wooden in his roles, he is not as awful as he is made out to be in some other reviews. The film boasts a fine cast and had some money behind it and there are some nice aspects to the story. This reviewer did not particularly mind watching the film.The problem is that the story is not fully fleshed to be a full length movie. There is no central point to the story to carry it to the length of a feature film. There is little purpose or philosophy that comes through as an overriding thematic. Van and Elizabeth play self destructive characters who suffer tragedy via doing some dumb things but...so what? Who really cares about dumb people doing dumb things? The emotional draw of the story never comes out. The emotion is stifled by the story; not by Van Johnson's acting. But...that is why this remained a short story that delved into the mind of the character pining for his lost daughter. There's just no emotional payoff with the characters that warrants nearly 2 hours of screen time.Still, compared to most of what passes for drama these days the film is far superior to what is released today. That's a sad commentary on film making and story writing today.One other note For a story that is set in Paris there is little sense that any of the action occurs in Paris. This ties into the script. Rather than using known aspects of Paris to enhance the flavor of the story there is little to utilize the location. The title of the film could be The Last Time I Saw New York City and nothing would materially change in the film.If you are interested in film and story telling and the history of cinema I recommend giving the movie a viewing to familiarize yourself with it. Some parts work well (Elizabeth Taylor as the woman in the fountain immortalized in a full wall mural in a bar) but some parts...notably the father\daughter\aunt relationship at the end...just comes off flat. The film is a mix of good and not so good and the mix of good and not so good reviews is a good reflection of the movie.

The movie becomes an endless series of similar scenes that have Van Johnson meeting with Liz Taylor. It has little forward momentum. Having never said a word to Van Johnson about her love (& the screenwriters not supplying her with a personality or any likable quality), Donna Reed carries a torch for like a decade and behaves as if Liz stole her man - despite the fact that Donna only knew him, at most, an hour longer, and only said about twelve words to him. Admittedly Liz is a crappy, evil sister, and Johnson is a heel, but Reed is passive & prematurely bitter. So no one really carries your interest. It's a rare movie that asks you to consider two figures as unlikeable as Johnson and Taylor as the leads. And it's maudlin.The DVD transfer is very bad. It looks like you're watching the movie through wet gauze after someone punched you in both eyes.I love Paris but there are other, better ways to enjoy a cinema trip to France.

Walter Pigeon does as well as could be expected, considering his one-note bluff and hearty character.

"},{"Title":"Two Reasons Why the Studio System Failed","Date":"6 February 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Reason # 1 - Lousy casting. The Last Time I Saw Paris is an expansion of F Scott Fitzgerald's elegiac short story Babylon Revisited, a lightly fictionalized depiction of the aftermath of Fitzgerald's marriage to Zelda. If MGM stretching a melancholy, intimate portrait of a flawed man into a feature-length romantic extravaganza was a bad idea, casting Van Johnson as the Fitzgerald character was a worse one. Charles Wills, the Fitzgerald stand-in, is a journalist who marries a beautiful but impulsive debutante in Paris right after World War II, lapses into drunken self-loathing after writing a few failed novels, and wastes his wife's inheritance on the way to becoming a puffy, alcoholic playboy. Johnson is certainly believable as a spineless gigolo, but he's too light in his loafers to play an angry husband and too light in the head to play a brilliant, tortured artist. Plus, he was in his late thirties by the time all this celluloid was wasted, so his celebrated boyish good looks were turning flabby. Thus, there's no reason Charles would attract two hot prospects like Liz Taylor and Donna Reed, the expatriate sisters who fight for the pudgy pretty boy's love in post- WWII Paris. Liz wins, of course, and while she's not bad as Wills' erratic wife Helen, she didn't have the acting chops to connect her character's wild, fountain-swimming side and hurt, vulnerable, wronged- wife side. At least she's having a lot more fun than poor Donna Reed, another beautiful actress hagged up to make Liz Taylor even prettier (I don't think Shelley Winters ever forgave George Stevens for frowzing her up in A Place in the Sun). The normally effervescent Miss Reed is asked to play Helen's repressed, embittered sister, and just in case she didn't get the hint that her character was emotionally distant, the studio decided to style and costume her like a constipated schoolmarm. Why MGM would waste an Oscar-winning knockout like Reed on such a drab, thankless role indicates some discombobulated priorities. Veteran actor Walter Pidgeon, as Liz and Donna's penniless bon vivant father, manages to project the necessary seedy charm, but since that's all he has to do, his near-constant presence makes him a well-manicured bore. Compounding the absurdity is Zsa Zsa Gabor, who by 1954 already looked like she'd just emerged from her seventh face-lift, wandering on screen as a wealthy socialite who has a tryst with Charles (why not just cast a drag queen - - it's Van Johnson, after all!). Van and Liz also manage to conceive a daughter, the most saccharine movie child this side of a Disney flick. The whole thing is a mess.Reason # 2 - Profligacy. Thousands of extras wander across the MGM soundstages intended to replicate post-WWII Paris. What could have been a sad, intimate portrait of two flawed people in love becomes an overlong Technicolor extravaganza of crowd scenes, party scenes, racetrack scenes, and one Monte Carlo Grand Prix auto race just to impede character development. At one point, the MGM costume department puts Johnson in a harlequin costume. The point? "},{"Title":"Sentimental Melodrama!

This film was shot in the early days of using color instead of black and white. The Parisian shots could have been better. The storyline is quite typical. Helen and Jimmy fall in love and get married and have a child, a beautiful daughter, Victoria. They remain in Paris, France where the living is good and the partying is non-stop. Well, Jimmy's writing career consists of constant rejection. Helen's unhappy as well in their marriage. The story is a bit outdated and melodramatic to involve acting but it's Van Johnson's film and not his co-star Elizabeth Taylor.

Scott Fitzgerald's Babylon Revisited, and it follows much the same formula as the Hemingway-inspired Snows of Kilimanjaro a couple of years earlier. The filmmakers took an acclaimed, fairly grim short story by an almost legendary American writer. They made it bigger and smoother and more romantic. Then they threw in several incidents (and purported incidents) from the famous author's own life. And voil√†! This one has a couple of advantage over Snows The title and the related title song. The original song The Last Time I Saw Paris was written for an earlier movie and was about the city's tragedy in World War II, not about the travails of a single couple in peacetime. But the tune is appropriately melancholy and Gallic-sounding, and it works beautifully here.Hemingway was alive when Snows was filmed, and he angrily objected to what Hollywood had done to his work. Fitzgerald had been dead for years when Paris was made, but I think he would have been more sad than angry. He was that kind of guy.If you've never read the short story, you'll enjoy this. If you have read the story, you'll still like the movie, even if you feel a bit guilty about it. Van Johnson is just so likable, and Elizabeth Taylor is just so lovely.

Nevertheless, everything in it is done well enough to make this a good (enough) genre movie to watch.The movie is needlessly told as a flashback, which also makes us the viewers already aware of how the main story ends, in advance. Sometimes in cases this approach works well for a story but not for such a mediocre movie as this one I'm afraid.In the midst of all the formulaic drama there are some fine actors in the movie, that get to shine. Elizabeth Taylor is really great and to me she was the one that truly carried the movie, though in screen time it is perhaps Van Johnson who plays the real main role of the movie. The movie also has a supporting cast to die for; Walter Pidgeon, Donna Reed, Eva Gabor and even a young Roger Moore in his first real notable movie role. I just wish that some of the character development would had been better though. Also the 'relationship' between Charles Wills and Marion Ellswirth never gets developed well enough, though it plays an essential part in all of the drama in the movie, especially in the beginning and toward the ending of the movie.The movie is really typical for MGM '50's standards, meaning that the drama is heavy but the approach of it isn't always. The movie at times tends to be more cheerful than dramatic, which isn't always for the movie its own benefits. Toward the end the drama thickens, which especially gives the movie its 'overdone' feeling, which also doesn't exactly make the movie more believable to watch. It's still a good enough drama to watch, just not one that will grab you.The movie uses some fine settings. Of course Paris is the perfect backdrop for a romantic movie and they used some nice locations in the movie (not the Eiffel tower for a change, even though it's still featured on the movie its cover). Also the costumes are quite nice.Good enough for its genre and MGM '50's standards but that doesn't exactly mean that it's a highly recommendable one though.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Play It Again, Van","Date":"14 February 2010","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" It's an update of F.

It will break your heart if you have one.As most all old movies go, it glosses/speeds over a lot of the character study and plot development that we come to appreciate in today's movies, as older movies tended to pick up the pace too quickly to enjoy an in-depth look at a relationship or a particular character, but I imagine that it would really break your heart if it had dug that deep in the script.If you want or expect the entire story to crumble at the end, you need psychological help.  There was no need for a complete and total tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, and the end was very plausible and necessary and is certainly more believable than the flip side would be.  It amazes me that most people look for believability in a script, including myself, as we basically go to a movie to escape believability, i.e., reality, but in this case, what you see is closer to the truth that anything.  Furthermore, if my life is screwed up, I don't want to watch a story turn out just like my screwed-up life.  I don't want others or the entire world around me to reflect that pain.

The ending did feel very forced and at odds with the mood of the rest of the film, there could have been more of a focus on the relationship between Helen and Charles, Van Johnson does start off a tad uncomfortable and his drunken argument with himself is pretty embarrassing and some of the film feels skimming the surface quality and lacking in depth with a dose of over-sentimentality. The film is also in serious need of a restoration, the faded, grainy print doesn't do it justice. But for all its flaws, The Last Time I Saw Paris has much to like and the good stuff is beautiful and charming indeed. The sets have a painterly charm and the Parisian location is irresistible(Paris has always been one of the most beautiful and romantic cities in the world, and couldn't have been a more perfect choice of location for this film) while the cinematography from Joseph Ruttenberg has a real intricacy, matching the mood and nostalgic atmosphere most fittingly, and Helen Rose's dresses are sumptuous in every sense of the word, especially Elizabeth Taylor's lavender dress which goes perfectly with her violet eyes. Conrad Salinger haunting and lush music score, a script despite the lack of depth that is intelligently, poignantly and wittily written- the car race is hilarious- and a story that has a fair amount of nostalgic charm and emotional resonance especially in the first half are also things to like. The direction is leisurely but not overly so, letting the film speak for itself, the characters are sympathetically drawn and likable although Charles is the only one who's really developed. And The Last Time I Saw Paris is also beautifully cast and beautifully played, especially by a luminous Elizabeth Taylor who brings sublime subtlety and nuances to her role an amusingly eccentric and endearingly roguish Walter Pidgeon. George Dolenz and Eva Gabor are also solid, Donna Reed is excellent in an atypical role and Sandy Descher proves herself to be an adorable child actress. Johnson may not start off well but the more interesting Charles gets the more comfortable and emotionally involved Johnson becomes, with his increasingly brooding, intense and affecting performance being one of the saving graces of the second half. Stylistically and tonally the film is true to F. Scott Fitzgerald's story Babylon Revisited despite the updating, but the story despite like the film having a weaker latter half had much more depth to the story and the characters more compelling in development and motivations.

But when Charles starts to take a liking to Helen, Marion becomes very jealous and holds a grudge against him for many years. Over the next few years, Charles marries, has a daughter, and struggles to have his novels published. Over time, the struggle to become a successful writer alienates his family from him, and threatens to tear apart the family.I usually like Liz Taylor movies, and I have never seen a bad performance from Walter Pidgeon, so I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Taylor is beautiful in this film, and she gives a fantastic performance. Pidgeon also does a great job playing the father of both young women. The rest of the actors also do very well in this movie, especially Donna Reed, Van Johnson and George Dolenz. In general, this film has good acting and a well-crafted script.Overall, I wanted to like this movie more than I really did. At the beginning of the film, I thought it was one I would like, and it starts off well. There are some great points in the movie, such as Van Johnson's character gazing at a mural of Liz Taylor's character, and then later seeing someone create it. The scenes with Johnson's character and his young daughter are especially effective, and that makes the end of the film so much better than it would have otherwise been, as you'll see.Donna Reed does a wonderful job in her role. She doesn't need to say much in order for us to know exactly what she is thinking or feeling throughout the movie. I was not impressed with Roger Moore, however. Tony Curtis is about the same age as Moore, but he would have been much better at this role. In fact, I think just about anyone could have played Moore's part better than he did.This movie also moves pretty slowly and seems a lot longer than the nearly 2-hour running time. There are several scenes which serve almost no purpose except to increase the running time. All of these excess scenes could have been cut out without any negative effects on the overall production. I do not want to say too much about the film, but if you watch this, you'll know what I mean about several stretches of the film that seemed unnecessary.The last 15 or so minutes of the film are by far the best. By then, the viewer knows exactly what happened to these families, but there is still a very compelling reason to watch it to the end. Maybe one reason the middle is so slow is to help set up the end of the film. That's what I'd like to believe anyway. Still, if it could have been slightly quicker to the end, I'd rate this movie higher.Finally, a note on the DVD. I watched the Madacy version of this movie, and I do not recommend it to anyone. The movie itself is fine, but the DVD transfer is absolutely horrible. There were several skips/jumps in the film and several obvious cuts that should have been done a lot better. There were no special features, and when the DVD loads, you get only one option play. This is at least the fifth Madacy DVD that I've seen, and they're always the same - terrible picture and sound quality.

It's basically a well-crafted soap opera set in a post-war Paris setting (after the liberation) but it works on several levels, thanks to some nice performances and crisp Technicolor photography. I saw this on WideScreen TV and it looks marvelous.ELIZABETH TAYLOR's motivations are somewhat obscure (she's almost another Zelda from Tender is the Night) but at this stage of her career Elizabeth was having success in some good adult roles and this is one of her better performances from that era. VAN JOHNSON could have used more depth as the would-be novelist turned alcoholic and DONNA REED's subdued performance as the bitter elder sister is rather one-note in concept.Richard Brooks has directed this in too leisurely fashion, but fans of Taylor and Johnson should certainly be pleased with the final results. Taylor is at the peak of her physical beauty and up to the demands of one of her early adult roles. Well worth watching, but at least a half-hour could have been cut without doing any harm to the story.For those who complain about the washed out look of the color photography on Public Domain prints, be aware that TCM is now showing it in a pristine restored print which makes it look like a much more impressive film than it really is.

TCM runs it fairly frequently, so perhaps it's better known than I realize. The cast is outstanding, and the script is also amazing, the lines are so beautifully written, especially for Elizabeth Taylor, each one is a surprise, very original yet totally in-keeping with the story. Van Johnson is a sweet well- meaning guy from the Midwest and Elizabeth Taylor is this fun- seeking woman from an eccentric family. They meet-up just as Paris is liberated. The two have really amazing chemistry, and the rest of the cast is fun to watch, especially Walter Pidgeon, who plays Taylor's father, who feels the most important thing in life is to have fun. It's also interesting to see the euphoria that followed the liberation of Paris, what heady times those must have been. Highly recommended, a little known gem.

Check the credits for a film before you embarrass yourselves.  It was Eva Gabor, not her sister, Zsa Zsa, who had a small role in this film.  Mama Jolie and her glamorous daughters are a part of the American celebrity/entertainment scene that so many of us remember rather fondly and Eva, among them, was quite a charming actress. (Check out her appearances in Minnelli's Gigi and the Paul Newman/Joanne Woodward clunker, A New Kind of Love, in which Eva almost stole the show, despite the presence of Thelma Ritter who usually carried off that particular prize.) The Last Time I Saw Paris was typical mid-Fifties high gloss soap opera from M-G-M, and it's a bit of a surprise that Richard Brooks was the director, since he's noted for somewhat more topical and/or hard-hitting stuff.  But, as a look back at the gorgeous Elizabeth emoting most fetchingly at the peak of her camera-worthiness, this one can hardly be beat.

So it is here that I finally watched this long-in-public-domain M-G-M feature that starred Van Johnson and Elizabeth Taylor with Donna Reed-the second Miss Ellie on that soap-among the supporting cast. In another coincidence that I appreciated while watching, there was a scene where the father of Donna and Elizabeth mentioned investing in some oil wells from Texas that turned out to be useless but later on became the opposite. And it was Ms. Reed's character who made the useless statement! Otherwise, I liked this drama about Johnson and Ms. Taylor's romance and later marriage that threatened to fall into the rocks when they both take possible paramours in Eva Gabor and Roger Moore, respectively. As for Ms. Reed, she doesn't seem much use as Ms. Taylor's sister until her climatic scene with Van Johnson near the end concerning his daughter. Sure, there may not be such a good reason for the ending to occur considering the way certain characters behaved but if one is willing to believe in Second Chances, then this one surely deserved them! So, yeah, that's a recommendation of The Last Time I Saw Paris.

Scott Fitzgerald died in 1940. He published his first novel in 1920 and his last in 1934. In the twenties and early thirties he turned out some fifty or so short stories for which, initially, he earned top dollar but when his wife, Zelda, was diagnosed as schizophrenic and hospitalized he turned to the bottle and apart from a series of pot-boilers about a Hollywood hack named Pat Hobby and a series of essays, The Crack-Up, published in Esquire magazine around 1936, he produced little of any merit, albeit he was working on a novel when he died. He owed his success, particularly where short stories were concerned, to his gift of both understanding and interpreting the 'voice' of young people in the 'Jazz' Age. Bablyon Revisited is one such story dating from his peak years so the minute MGM chose to 'update' it to some thirteen or fourteen years AFTER his death its uniqueness i.e. the 'voice' of the Jazz Age, was totally destroyed. Even the central sequence, a flashback that begins in 1945 can't do much to help as that was still five years after Fitzgerald died. That being said it is, of course quite possible that movie buffs who couldn't care less about Fitzgerald would have checked this out on the strength of Elizabeth Taylor - who had grown up at MGM - Van Johnson, who had starred in several big-budget MGM movies in the forties and Walter Pigeon, who had likewise appeared in some top grossing MGM fodder (and had, ironically, just appeared in The Bad And The Beautiful, also from MGM which lifted a few rocks in the tide-pool that is Hollywood to reveal the unsavory marine life scrabbling around there). These people may well have come away content and serenely oblivious to Fitzgerald's ending, diametrically opposed to the one on offer here. The bad news is that even as I write the semi-amateur Baz Luhrman has got his claws into The Great Gatsby and is no doubt even now attempting to outdo the joke he entitled Moulin Rouge.

So I popped it in and didn't actually think I would watch it. I had a million things to do, and thought it would just be playing in the background. Then I found myself drawn to it. Elizabeth Taylor was very pretty and the couple seemed so happy. I'm thinking, what a nice little movie to be over 50 years old. What a strange twist, almost like Vanilla Sky, that suddenly, all goes wrong, or at least it seemed sudden. I mean, life is well and good, and he gets a hair up his bum because he can't get published ? He's rich, he has a beautiful wife who loves him, he has a beautiful daughter, his Father-in-law likes him, his brother-in-law likes him, OK his Sister-in-law doesn't like him but that's only because she secretly loves him ... what more can a guy ask for? My goodness and isn't Roger Moore a goon in this movie. Eva Gabor? Well, I can only think of her as Mrs. Oliver Wendell Douglas for some reason. Anyway, He had it made and then he acts like a fool. I can't believe he locked the door. I can't believe Elizabeth Taylor's character DIES! I was in shock! What a cruddy way for this movie to go. OK so it was based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's life someone said ... who cares? This could have been a great film if it had been written about the reconciliation of the husband and wife and how they went back to America together and just visited Paris occasionally. I can't believe he turned down her request to go back to America when she was alive and then when she DIES, he decides to go back to America. What the hell was all that about. Had he simply agreed to go back to America in the first place and stopped being such a dork, she would have lived. What an incredible tragedy! The cover of the VHS looked so cheerful! I thought it was going to be something like It's A Wonderful Life!, after all, it did have Donna Reed in it. God, I really loved and hated this movie!

I admit I've never read the Fitzgerald short story. Therefore I'll accept the point made by others who see a lose of substance here. Very few films do justice to their literary sources. Oddly enough, when I saw Paris for the first time I believed, for a while, a plot twist involving the child Vicy was in the works. Something along the line of developing tuberculosis or polio ( near the end the girl falls down while dancing in front the father ). Even the way she is made up suggested emaciation or sickness ... or a developing sociopathy ( if we are to believe her terrible acting was not simply the result of poor production values ). Otherwise the plot line is ... well ... passable by the standard of older films and quite good in comparison to today's junk ... which is not saying much. I give it a seven with some reservations.

Enjoy the repeating entree of Elisabeth Taylor. She suffers from playing in a worn-out movie (Richard Brooks, eat your hat) and has to deal with an actor who is depressed all along with an up-tight hair-do. Hopefully this movie is the last of its kind. Scene after scene put in front of a camera without any expressions of feeling. You never will be dragged into it. Within a few years (after release) the french cinema (Truffaut, Malle etc) will lead the way to a new kind of filmmaking. And in that wake Brooks resurrected as director and writer with movies like Key Largo, Elmer Gantry etc. Luckely Scott Fitzgerald did not live long enough to see his film.

Movies about life in general.  Van Johnson is a writer whose novels are never published. He marries, has a daughter and strikes it rich.  But happiness eludes him. He drinks and suffers from some kind of unfulfilled existential longing.  It could have been a better film. Taylor is miscast. Someone plainer.  The emotional climaxes didn't work. Tears didn't flow. Maybe it's better that way.

They have for decades and decades, and they continue to.  I'm sure though that this movie was very entertaining and new to the viewers when it first came out, but i don't see how it can be considered so today.  Movies back then had to have a good story with it because they didn't have special effects or anything helpful like that.  That is why I like old movies.

Van Johnson just doesn't have the chops for this. The women do, and there are undercurrents they lay that probably aren't in the script. The idea is attractive. The situation is too. The characters of the family work. Especially useful is the business about Liz's image being created by herself in the caf√©, and then literally on the wall by an artist.But Van and overall heaviness ruin thisThis was one of those subsidized movies that the US used to convince the world that Paris was a romantic city.
