All the stereotyped characters are in place, and they are all funny as hell, particularly the fat brain-damaged slob standing in for John Bluto Blutarski, who was of course a senator, or a retired senator, or maybe even a dead senator by the time this story takes place. I may have written a previous review when I first bought this. I watched it today for the first time in quite awhile and was impressed on how well it was paced and put together. I suspect it cost a few bucks to make, just based on the many setups and sets, although the actors are for the most part unknown. And it smells like it was shot in Canada, which always saves money. As Leonard Maltin said of it, it is not funny every second but it sure keeps moving for its brief running time. I agree wholeheartedly, although I think it is funny every second -- as long as you put your brain on hold and are prepared to see a bunch of high school seniors drugging and chugging and fugging their way through the movie. I am just old enough that it somewhat shocked me the several times I have watched this. (By contrast, I was a late starter. I wasn't drugging and chugging until college, although I was certainly fugging in high school.) Ah well, I imagine this must have been R-rated just for the constant drug references, never mind all the beer and bourbon being sloshed down. Tommy Chong is their bus driver, for gosh sakes!

It appeared to be a very good no brainer for a 90 minute laugh.  Unfortunately it wasn't well taken to by movie-goers which made its release to vhs very slow and limited.  It hasn't even made it to dvd yet and I know of terribly worse comedies that have, and most are from the present Saturday Night Live Crew. The film does fulfill the area of not only certain high school hijenks, but also a human feeling for the kids of that specific time.  It pushed through the ideas of free alcohol, drugs but not so much sex.  There was the element of sex, in words and conversation, but no real nudity or fulfillment. Overall an excellent film that would have done better a few years later when teen flix came back with a vengeance.  Senior Trip carries with it the National Lampoon feel of Animal House, but doesn't veer off into a demented spoof like Not Another Teen Movie.  It filled the void where drama and action films had worn away movie goers in the mid 90s.  Watch for Tommy Chong as the bus driver and the chemistry, whether electrified or jaded between the characters.

They're not funny, they're interesting to watch. Jeremy Renner is the ringleader, an under-achiever who has accepted his limitations and blindly corrupts logic to break the rules. He should have been a break out star, but the direction doesn't explore his comedic chops and he is forced to mug, grimace and cow tow to the rest of the cast. The true funny presence to watch is character-actor Kevin MacDonald as the psycho Trekkie with a chip on his shoulder who wants to takeout Renner's character for years of psychological abuse; he's the one to watch here as he goes through abuse after abuse and realizes the things he learned from Star Trek don't help him in the real world. Matt Frewer is wasted as an exasperated, harried and frustrated principal stuck in one mode as the kids push him over the end; he's pretty much the kids patsy and victim from one end of the movie to the other. Eric Edwards plays a forced Belushi clone an sleepy yet vice-driven imbecile without morals, but without any of the charm, humor or presence of John or Jim Belushi. (To see him now, you'd never expect he was the same actor!) Tommy Chong is stuck in the same one-joke clich√© role he plays in every movie a conspiracy-talking pothead who is his own worst enemy. It's a shame he's written off so early; investigating his life would have been more interesting. My favorite character is Carla Morgan played by Tara Charendoff; she oozes sex and kittenishly moves through the movie possessed by Marilyn Monroe showing off the full range of her acting ability. The plot is weak; it runs like a documentary of high school rejects attached to a loose sequence of comedic criminal events and unfunny disasters filled with a huge cast of unknowns. Only Charendoff and Nicole DeBoer would go on to any greater success. It lacks the spirit of Animal House, the humor of John Landis or the commentary of Harold Ramis, and yet, you wonder what sort of damage these kids could do somewhere else and there, there is the one saving point of this film that you wonder what happens to them next.

It stars Matt Frewer as a school principal who punishes his students after a prank gone wrong. He makes his students write a letter to Washington explaining why the school system must change. This earns them a trip to Washington where they steal everything that isn't bolted down. Contrived formula with an ending that makes every lame excuse for the behavior witnessed by the viewer. Directed by Kelly Makin who is backed with some effective visual elements including an outraged Star Trek fanatic. Frewer does what he can as the stiff principal but the role is a prop not a personality. Tommy Chong plays a bus driver who overdoses on pills. Also with Kevin McDonald and Valerie Mahaffey among others, and everyone of them deserve an F on this cinematic report card. These teenagers are hardly sympathetic and the screenplay never develops any one character beyond surface appeal, unlike the broad personalities to the characters in Animal House.

Those who got caught were the previously mentioned stoners, an overweight guy who is constantly eating something, the good girl virgin, the school slut, the black guy who wants to be Malcolm X plus a computer dork who enjoys reading Playboy magazine since he can't get a real woman.In the detention center the kids are made to write a letter to the President on the current state of education in America. Of course the smart girl ends up doing the report and it turns out that the letter actually makes it to the White House and the President decides to let the kids come to Washington so that they can introduce his new education bill. They've got two days to get to Washington and the road trip begins when Red (Tommy Chong), the horse pill popping bus driver shows up and declares the party official. The next two days are full of your typical sex and drugs but when the kids learn that they are just being used for political reasons, they decide to show that they aren't dumb after all.National Lampoon's Senior Trip is without a doubt one of the dumbest, most lame films ever made. Everything from the acting to the directing to the so-called screenplay are amateurish and perhaps that's being a bit too nice. There isn't a single original idea throughout the entire film and most of the time the film tries to go all out with over the top stereotypes as well as silly party scenes leading up to a so-called dramatic ending where the losers become winners. Every single scene in this film is something we've previously seen yet we're fortunate because the film is still pretty damn funny. The term so bad it's good certainly applies to this film.What makes this bad movie work is the effort that is obviously going on throughout it. You can tell that the actors are trying their best to recreate earlier teen films like National Lampoon's Animal House and Porky's but they fail horribly in every sense yet them failing so badly is what gets a laugh from the viewer. We can look at all the stereotypes, which are seen the same way they were back in the 1980's. We've got the fat kid who does nothing in the movie except eat food. We get a dork who loves Playboy magazine yet fails to perform when a sex kitten offers him the time of his life. We get the good-girl virgin who deep down really wants to go wild with sex and alcohol. We got the bad boy who likes her and is willing to be a bit on the good side to get down her pants. We then get the dork teachers pet who deep down is a homosexual.The stereotypes themselves are very politically incorrect, which also adds to some of the charm. There's a hilarious, if stupid, scene where the teacher's pet is asked by the Principle for help and the guy gets down on his knees thinking that's the help needed. We get another scene where the overweight guy goes all out on his fantasy where he would have sex with a real Jap from China. We even get a nice porno take of Forrest Gump called Forrest Humps. If all of this sounds incredibly stupid, well it is and that's what makes the film funny. All of these jokes, as bad as they are, are being acted and directed as if they were the greatest comic lines ever written so we're left laughing at ourselves laughing at the film more than we're actually laughing at what's in the film.The biggest stab in the film goes towards Star Trek fans as one characters is so obsessed with the series that he goes all out (with his rubber sex partner) to destroy one of the senior members. There another politically incorrect scene where the Trek-nut kidnaps a Chinese family, which has to be seen to believe. Then there's the cameo by Tommy Chong, which while funny should have been a whole lot better. Sadly all the promos made it feel that he would have a large chunk in the film but he's in and out way too quickly but before he goes Chong delivers a few good pot jokes as well as a nice homage back to his days with Cheech.National Lampoon's Senior Trip is a very poor film but if you don't mind an offensive and lamebrain film then I'm sure you'll get enough chuckles out of it. You certainly shouldn't go into this thing expecting anything like Animal House and if you do you'll certainly be very disappointed. This is a very poorly made film that thankfully gets bad enough to get a few laughs. When I originally saw this in the theaters I was hoping this would be a return form to the good old days where teen comedies weren't rated PG-13 and didn't have a silly message to relay. There's no message here and the dirtiness certainly deserved the R-rating but by in large, the film is forgotten for a reason and I doubt a cult will ever pick up on it.

His friends include computer geek Virus, totally dim Miosky, intelligent girl Lisa, sexy Carla and quiet Herbert. Moss was furious when he discovered what was up and the next day in detention when Moss asked why they did what they did, Dags claimed it was the government's fault, so Principal Moss instructed them to write the president and share their views. So while the students laughed their behinds off at a sexual educational film strip, Lisa wrote the letter. The president instructed Senator Lerman to have the kids brought to D.C. to speak on behalf of his education reform bill. Lerman found out just what kind of students they were and was pleased because this was his opportunity to make the president look bad.            Next morning, they leave for Washington. Their bus driver was Tommy Chong (Red)! What they didn't suspect was crazed neighborhood crossing guard Travis was following them. He was an obsessed fan of Star Trek and was on a mission to destroy the Kingons (the students) and he's got a giant Lt. Uhura doll with him. The road trip was not uneventful. The students threw a big party. Principal Moss had brought along honor student Steven Nisser to rat out his friends upon any lude behavior. The students try to lose Principal Moss in a convenience store while snatching some booze. And that night while they partied, Red decided to join them and passed away in the morning.          But soon they finally make it to Washington! They take in te sights, like the eternal flame of J. Edgar Hoover, because Principal Moss decided they didn't deserve Kennedy's. Travis tailed them all the way; Dags and his buddies decide to go to a party but Steven threatened to blow the whistle, until Miosky took care of him.           Next day was the day the students speak to the members of Congress. Lisa accomplished her dream to not go through life a virgin so she and Dags...did the bad thing. Lerman caputed Miosky to really make the president look bad, so Moss and the students jumped on the bus and arrived just in time.

After the amazingly funny team of D'Agastino and Reggie's plans for a senior class party at the prinicpal's house lands them and some of their buddies in detention (I don't know why the selected few were the only ones to get busted). Only shielding themselves from a harsh punishment by reasoning that somehow the school system is responsible for their troublemaking ways, Principal Moss gives them an assignment write a letter to the government citing their grievances for the poor education system. This is something Moss will regret later as the President receives the letter. He calls up the Senator who's state Fairmount High is in and tells them to send the class up to Washington because these kids are going to help sponsor his education reform bill. The last thing anyone in their right mind would do is stick these burnout party kids on a bus (for some Van-damage!) for a couple days. And with Tommy Chong, as Red (named for his immunity to horse tranquilizer as he demonstrates later), as the bus driver, all hell breaks loose! The President is in for a big surprise, and that's exactly what Senator Lerner wants. Once he meets the group of misfits, especially Miosky (Eric Edwards) the silent bonehead chow hound, he knows that their appearance before the committee will pull support from the President's bill, and permit him to introduce his own education reform bill.Meanwhile, Dag's slow talking pothead friend, Reggie, is being chased by a psychotic Trekkie crossing guard, Travis (Kevin McDonald), who Reggie earlier insulted, adding a hilarious subplot of the deranged wacko dressed in the Captain's uniform and carrying a blow-up doll who just won't seem to leave Reggie alone. The movie, albeit an incredibly stupid plot, it is outrageously funny, watching Dags, Reggie, and the gang foil Principal Moss's plan to keep these misfits from causing too much trouble. Besides Dag's, the arsonist, and Reggie, his spaced out friend, there's Virus, the horny Audio/Visual geek; Wanda, Reggie's equally spaced out girlfriend;, Lisa, the brain; Herbert, the guy who is in perpetual mourning; Meg, the lesbian; Steve, the preppie jerk who gets his just deserts; Miosky; and Carla, the nymphomaniac. These kids do everything from locking their principal in a flooding convenient store bathroom to steal beer, to drugging their principal and chaperone, a timid math teacher, to throwing a rad party in a crude man's huge hotel room. It is one of the better teen comedies you'll find in the late 90s and one of the last few National Lampoon movies. I recommend checking it out.

Maybe, it's just because I've not seen a lot of teen comedies.It was year 1996 in Russia, when I bought this movie on VHS in little shop near my house. At this time I was a little stupid kid. I think, I was 10 or 11 years old. This movie made a big impression on me. You know, it's kinda hard to explain my feelings in English, cause it's not my native language, but I'll try.Since I was a kid, I wanted to become a cool, mature guy. I thought that being mature is like having parties all the time, drinking alcohol and so on. Senior trip had it all in it. It was really funny, it had all this cool music, that I tried to like. At this time I got my first Nirvana CD. I liked to be the one I was. I liked being bad, talking in bad language, joking about sex. Yes, I was a bad kid. A really bad one. After years of life such as this I get to hospital, I was really depressed, but it has nothing to do with the movie.It was very cool to listen to grunge music in 1996, though it was not so popular in the US. And the movie felt like a grunge movie for me. Yeah, I know it's a very stupid movie, it has a lot of crap in it, but I still like it, cause it was like a Bible at my teenage. It showed me another, alternative life, not the stupid life I was living. My best friend liked this movie, too. He is the only one whom I showed it to this day. For me it's very personal movie, though it's neither about my life nor about my country. I think, it's very hard to understand, why I think it's great. Cause it's just my feeling, which I can't explain in Russian, too.After this movie I saw some teen comedies like American pie, Road trip, Not another teen movie, Scary movie, but all of them are a much more badder than Senior trip. Yes, I laughed when I watched first parts of American pie and Scary movie, but I've never wanted to re-watch them again.I don't think that this movie will be a hit, if it gets re-published today. The world has changed, the teenagers have changed. This movie is a history now. Nothing else. But in my heart it is a classic.

Most of the time, any studio that releases the movie that gets two thumbs up will rush to print the accolade on the box of the movie when it is released to video. But if it DOESN'T get two thumbs up, there's no need to worry because there is bound to be somebody who has something good to say about a movie.I mention this because when I rented this movie a long time ago, not one review graced the cover of this train wreck.  Not one.  I would soon discover why.when I watched this movie I was 15 years old, so you figure I was part of this movie's target audience.  But I can tell you, as a 15-year old kid, I didn't laugh at all.  The movie was totally, utterly unfunny.The story follows a bunch of high school seniors who embark on a trip to Washington, D.C.  A grab-bag of mindless high school stereotypes (handsome rebellious guy, anti-social guy, disgusting fat moron, smart goody-two shoes, computer nerd, promiscuous outcast) get thrown into detention and are assigned to write an essay, which will be sent to Washington, explaining the faults in the modern American education system.  The smart goody two shoes, Miss Tracy Milford (Valerie Mahaffey) is the only one who actually writes a paper, and wouldn't you know, the President reads it and loves it.  Enter the senior trip.I hoped that at least things would get funny here, as road trip movies usually involve unusual situations/characters.  It's cliche, but who cares if it's done well, right?  Well, it's not done well here.  Kevin McDonald, the only person in this movie I recognized from other projects (aside from Tommy Chong in an amazingly humor-devoid role as the bus driver who is a raging drug addict) plays a weird Star Trek-obsessed crossing guard, who has a personal vendetta against one of the seniors, and chases the group to D.C. Don't ask.After a series of stupid and endless scenes, we finally end up in D.C., where the President finds out that the group of kids aren't the scholars he thought that they were.  This leads to a mercilessly banal, sappy speech from the seniors about how it's too late for them, but not for tomorrow's children, or something smiliar.  I can believe that one could be convinced that public education is in bad shape by parading these kids around, but I can't believe that the response solicited from such a display would be the ever popular 'slow clap', started by the President himself.  After that, the movie somehow ends, but not soon enough.I identified with none of the characters portrayed in the movie.  Even Tracy Milford, who at one point looked like she was above the rest of the crew, totally betrayed me when it was revealed that she had feelings for Mark Dags D'Agastino (Jeremy Remner, the star of the movie), a punk that no girl of intelligence or ambition could ever find attractive.  While most teen comedies have outlandish characters, there is always at least a grain of truth to them.  I was spoon-fed a series of what looked like an out-of-touch writer's uneducated guess of what they thought high school kids were.  So awful was this movie that some seven years after viewing it I can still recall it well enough to review it.  Most bad movies I hope to never see again. This is the kind of bad movie I hope to repress.National Lampoon's Senior Trip  Zero stars (out of four)  "},{"Title":"not enough laughs","Date":"7 March 2015","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Slacker Mark D'Agastino (Jeremy Renner) is chasing prudish class hottie Lisa and organizes senior skip day party at principal Todd Moss (Matt Frewer)'s house.

Moss and new teacher Tracy Milford (Valerie Mahaffey) chaperon the group of misfits on their senior trip with Red (Tommy Chong) driving the bus.This is fascinating to see a really young Jeremy Renner. However there is nothing too compelling about this. There are few laughs. Renner is not the flamboyant type to lead this group in a comedy. It's also interesting to have Nicole de Boer in this with Kevin McDonald playing a crazed Trekkie following the group. I'm not saying this is horrible but it simply doesn't have enough laughs.

The President is so impressed he invites them to Washington, so all the kids pile into a rickety bus and head off to the capital. This juvenile teen comedy manages to contain just about every genre stereotype - the fat slob, the cool joker, the prissy swot and so on - but it does raise a few laughs along the way, thanks in no small part to Frewer's manic performance, as opposed to, say, decent writing.

Meanwhile a ridiculously one-dimensional principal tries to put a stop to this because well, just because. The jokes are pretty stale, and the characters are unlikeable, but I still enjoyed this movie for some reason.

I can't help but think it was in part due to the National Lampoon's pre-fix that they chose to include. The film centers around Dags & Reggie, two lovable stoners who, after thrashing the principals house, are put on detention with the rest* of the party-goers.... They write an essay to the president, and he sends for them to make a journey to washington to talk to senate about their concerns with education. From the start of the journey, the film comes into its own, and becomes genuinely funnier than most of its ilk. Stand out performances included Tommy Chong as Red the bus driver, Kevin McDonald (of Kids In The Hall fame) as the traffic crossing guard, and Jeremy Renner as Dags. The cast works well together, the only weakness perhaps being Reggie (Rob Moore) whose part oft comes off as over-acted and under-talented, though the plot moves at a nice pace, the jokes come thick and fast (and with a surprising level of subtlety too). A great film to pull out if you and some friends are planning an evening of inebriation and fancy a few good laughs.*(I should really point out right here there were a bunch of people in the party footage that never ended up on the washington trip)  "},{"Title":"Underrated teen comedy, with charismatic actors and funny characters as a highlight.","Date":"1 June 2004","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  A great comedy about high school kids and their mishaps.

Where do I start?1.) In being made by National Lampoon, it appeared to try way too hard to be Animal House. There was a stupid fat guy, an uptight head of the school, a straight laced honor student, and the rest of the student got drunk and/or stoned. There was one militant black guy that would have made an interesting character, but his character was pushed to the back too often. Above all, you didn't feel any sort of sympathy for the main characters, which is why the movie didn't play out very well.2.) The principal was unnecessarily stupid. When the evil senator threatened to have the principal revoked from his job, I didn't blame him. The principal character should have been the moral center of the story, the only sane person in an insane situation. That kind of situation makes for uproarious laughter, and it's something the writers, not to mention the actor who played him, should have taken into account.3.) The title of the movie didn't fit. Yes the students were seniors, and yes they were going on a trip, making the title Senior Trip sound obvious enough. However, the title made you think that every senior was going on this trip, which was not true. Plus, the students didn't embark on the trip until halfway through the movie, since the premise took too long to extrapolate before the movie's main premise got underway. In my opinion, the beginning scene with the High On Life band was completely unnecessary, not to mention not funny. I'm not a stoner, and I would have booed that band.4.) The movie employed too many movie clich√©s which weighed down the potential hilarity of the movie, from the uptight teacher getting her hands on alcohol to the undeserved slow clapping to the unnecessary epilogue at the end of the movie. One could argue that it was parodying other movies, but this movie didn't appear to parody anything.5.) Kevin McDonald. Simply putting him in any movie is a bad idea. Sure he was funny when he was with the Kids In The Hall, but nearly every movie he has been in has sucked, from The Godson to The Ladies Man to this movie. Plus, his character wasn't necessary to the movie, and you had no clue why he was chasing these kids to D.C. other than the fact that he had nothing better to do. If there is a plus side to his character, it reminds you that hardcore Trekkies are too damn annoying to function properly in today's society.I did buy this movie for $8.00 in a special Double Feature edition with National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 on the other side of the disc.
