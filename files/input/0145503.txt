Obviously, there is a lot more to modern Europe than watching snipers creep around Stalingrad and other such things.In Sunshine, I found an answer to my search.  It is undoubtedly the best historical portrait of Europe from the late 19th-mid 20th century that I have ever come across.  It does an EXCELLENT job of showing the emotions and realities of the progressions of Europe during this time.  Since it is in Hungary, we are exposed to monarchy, fascism, and communism, all of which are portrayed vividly.As if the history was not enough, the movie is wonderful in other ways as well.  Ralph Fiennes has the opportunity to showcase an amazing range of emotions and personalities in this movie, as he plays three different characters.  It was also pure genius on the part of the movie staff to cast a real life mother and daughter to play the same woman at various stages of her life.Great movie, I highly recommend it.

The story is extremely well done with rich finely etched characters.  The screenplay is better suited for a miniseries than a three hour film simply because there is so much material to cover.  Three hours is both too long and too short; the story is emotionally exhausting making it too long for one sitting, yet the total length is not long enough to do the subject matter justice.Hungarian Writer/Director Istvan Szabo captures Hungary's turbulent transition from empire to fascist state to soviet satellite weaving the history of the times into the lives of this extraordinary family.  He puts a human face on the historical facts giving us a disturbingly real look at what it might have been like to live through it, especially from the Jewish perspective.Despite a whirlwind pace that requires years to be spanned in minutes, Szabo manages to conjure deep and insightful character studies of the members of each generation.  His period renderings are exquisite from costumes to props to locations.  This is a wonderfully textured presentation with history layered over the human stories, addressing the many indignities suffered by Jews in Hungary during the period, and the many concessions made to merely stay alive.  It is a story that contains both triumph and tragedy, presented with amazing candor.Ralph Fiennes gives three incredible performances as the grandfather, father and son of the patriarchy.  Szabo has endured criticism for casting the same actor in three roles, but in this case it is an excellent choice.  Fiennes is a versatile artist and personalizes three radically different characters, slipping on their personalities like a glove.  He loses himself in each, rendering them all passionately but appropriately based on the motivations established in Szabo's careful character development.  With Szabo's guidance, it is clear that Fiennes has an inherent understanding of the psyche of his three characters and plays them with believable nuance.Two different actresses play Valerie and each is splendid.  Jennifer Ehle plays the young Valerie and endows her with ardor and vivacity.  She establishes Valerie as the strongest continuing character in the film, providing linkage between the past and the present.  In another stroke of casting brilliance, Szabo selects Ehle's real life mother, Rosemary Harris as the elder Valerie.  The clear resemblance linked with Harris' magnetic performance adds fullness to Valerie's later years.  William Hurt and James Frain lead an ensemble of strong supporting actors that give the film great intensity and depth of talent.This thoughtful and emotionally provocative character study is engrossing and compelling.  I rated it a 9/10 only because I wish Szabo would have gone deeper and divided it into two or three installments.  On a dramatic and artistic level, this film is first rate.

Sunshine, superior to Schindler in many respects, got fewer accolades and much less attention. Why do I think Sunshine is superior to Schindler? Primarily because it tells the story of the Holocaust through the lens of a single family whose pre-Holocaust history gives a dimension and depth to the tragedy of that family that Schlinder is incapable of providing because of its quite different narrative strategy and focus. To be sure, Schindler's narrative sweep affords a greater sense than Sunshine of the scope of the slaughter. But Sunshine stands in relation to Schindler as a novel stands to a work of history. One brings the insights offered by individual tragedies, the other brings more of a societal perspective. The best Holocaust film, however, remains in this viewer's opinion, The Pawnbroker with Rod Stieger, which had an even narrower focus than Sunshine and brought the horror of the Holocaust to life by exploring the emotional desolation/death suffered by a single survivor. A truly great film.

I admit a few things I would like to have seen the ending be Sors III's speech at Knorr's funeral (and the f*** you against the officer), then the scene of him walking down the alley with that final monologue.  That would have left a far more memorabel mark, but the way the ending was done was too far extended.  The first forty minutes also seem such weak costume drama compared to the intensity of the next two hours that they should have been vigorously cut.  Third, the sex scenes- why so repetitive and abrupt?  I love seeing Rachel Weisz (The Mummy) and Deborah Kara Unger (Crash) in ecstasy as much as anyone, but it got to be almost boring.  Fourth- the music and cinematography seemed rather dull.     However, once we get past these flaws, Sunshine is a great, powerful work about dignity and how we value ourselves within a society that rejects us.  I am an American Irish Catholic, so I have not felt the oppression of minorities, thankfully, nor have the last few generations of my family.         I thank Mr. Fiennes and Szabo for showing how each one of the Sonnenschein men struggle for dignity and purpose within the system, yet they fail each time to give joy primacy in their lives.  Every time, the system they so revere would put people second and ideology first (read review of Michael Collins.)  Valery knew the value of seeking joy, and thankfully she passes that on to her grandson, who survived the utter misery of the Stalinist regime.     This film shows such brutality at one moment that I cracked open in the theater (those who have seen the film know the moment I refer to.)  However, I did not find it excessive- rather it was absolutely essential to showing the depths of the personal horror that the Sors went through in the Holocaust.  As Knorr says, Surviving Aushwitz does not make you a bigger or a greater man.  It only gets burned into your brain.      The film does not expertly reveal relationships between men and women, besides Valery and Ignatz's tryst, but I felt it detailed the faults and promises of each political regime very well, based on what I've read.     Fiennes should get another Oscar nod for this, as should Rosemary Harris for best supporting actress.  What infuriates me is that Sunshine will never get to the major theatres, the way we're now measuring films like they were race horses instead of creative efforts.  I don't know why it is we now feel only the most simple, light, corny and action-crammed films can go into the multiplexes (albeit many of those films good ones.)  This is great, provocative entertainment worth spreading around.  Like American History X, Sunshine certainly has its faults, but its messages about tolerance, humanity, and redemption are glorious.

I liked the idea of a film dealing with three generations of a family (one that goes through war and revolution) and I liked the idea of Ralph Fiennes playing multiple roles. Consequently, I was pleased that the film lived up to my expectations.Ralph Fiennes is unquestionably the main reason why the film works so well. Each character he plays (the narrator, and the narrator's father and grandfather) is distinctive and separate from the rest while also having the traits of previous generations. For instance, each character is passionate and stubborn, and each is caught up in twisted love affairs and has to fight anti-Semitism, but while Ignatz is a free spirit who gradually becomes more and more bitter, Adam is a confident ladykiller and Ivan is a sullen bureaucrat who slowly comes to life towards the end. It's a subtle, unflashy performance, and one that works superbly.It also transcends gimmickry. But while Fiennes deserves credit for making his performance work, the writing and direction are also excellent. I especially like the way that certain themes resonate through the different generations &#150; each character has to fight against prejudice, is burned by people in power and has unsuccessful relationships. Times may change but people don't.This sentiment is proved true by the various regimes that inhabit the film. The Hungarian monarchy, the fascist military and the communists may all be different in terms of aesthetics, but at heart they're all the same. They're all power hungry and they have no loyalty towards their citizens; they may preach freedom, but all they want is control and the perks of authority. And through the film those in power betray each successive generation of the Sonnenschein family, and in each case anti-Semitism is at the root of the problem. Not that the family doesn't try its hardest to fit in. Ignatz changes the Jewish surname Sonnenschein to the more neutral Sors so that he can become an important judge. And for a while he prospers, but then the monarchy starts to talk of Jewish conspiracies. However, Ignatz stays loyal and he refuses to join the communists when they briefly take over, leading him to become incredibly bitter and to die a miserable death.But the family doesn't learn. Adam, Ignatz's son, becomes close to the military regime that takes over from the communists by becoming part of the Officer's Club fencing team. But like his father, he isn't allowed to becoming part of the club straight away. He's only allowed to join the elite fencing team after he's converted to Catholicism. The family's identity is being eroded even further. But he's driven to this decision by an inferiority complex. There's a scene where he's bullied by a gang of older boys as a child who mock the fact that he's Jewish. They hold a sword to his throat. They make him apologise for being Jewish and for polluting the air. This drives him towards fencing and he eventually becomes an Olympic champion. But the childhood scene is chillingly echoed in the scene where Adam is taken to a labour camp during the outbreak of the Second World War. The soldiers ask him what he is and he refuses to say that he's a Jew. Instead he says that he's an Olympic gold medallist. He's trying to assert his true identity, rather than the technicalities of birth and heritage. But the soldiers wont have it, and in the most powerful scene in the film, they strip and beat him while continually asking him the same question. He refuses to beg like he did as a child and to apologise for what he is and as a result he's strung up on a tree, and in the dead of winter, is hosed down. The water freezes on him and he dies with his son watching on.But despite watching this atrocity, Ivan (Adam's son) fails to learn the lesson it should teach him. It should teach him never to repeat these sorts of things. But instead, consumed by a desire for revenge and by naive idealism (his championing of Stalin is rather hard to stomach), he joins the communist party that takes over the country after the war. First he's asked to capture the fascists, but then as the communist party proves itself no better than anyone else, he's asked to betray friends based on trumped up charges. He even becomes like the guards who killed his father when he's asked to continue torturing his friend who refuses to confess to being part of a conspiracy. And on top of that he even has to endure more anti-Semitism &#150; the Jews make an easy scapegoat when you're incompetent (like the monarchy, the communists fear that the Jews are conspiring to take over the country). But unlike Ignatz and Adam, Ivan gets a second chance. He sees through the crap and leaves the party. And in the end he even changes the family name back from Sors to Sonnenschein. It's an excellent ending. It shows that you can't hide what you are and that it's better to stand up and be counted. Why feel shame for something there's nothing to be ashamed of? However, I do have a couple of minor gripes. First, the set-up is extraordinarily brief. I know the film is fighting for time, but the opening few minutes are a bit of a whirlwind. And secondly, Rachel Weisz's character is incredibly annoying. I didn't enjoy her performance at all. But those problems are nothing really. They certainly didn't prevent me from enjoying the film.

Fiennes plays all 3 generations of males in the family as they accommodate with imperialism, fascism and communism-- and gee not once does anyone say You look so much like your father!, though the all senior citizen audience guffawed by his 3rd appearance. But then they also guffawed that all the repetitive sex is the same through the century, lustful attacks on the sly with much frantic clothes removal, and unflattering camera angles up the nose. Tony-nommed mother and daughter team Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris breathe tremendous life into the movie as the younger and older self of a fulcrum character, which Fiennes did less often because his characters were so repressed. I'm not sure if it was intentional that each of the 3 generations had the same personality so that the viewer tells them apart by their facial hair and costumes (well, when he's wearing clothes).In more ways than one this reminded me of The Marriage of Maria Braun, a bitingly satirical German film that made similar points with humor on the same theme as Meet the New Boss, same as the Old Boss. The script, co-written by the director and Israel Horowitz, I assume the playwright, is too didactic in making its points, but the philosophical decision points it focuses on in history are interesting, trying to identify when and about what people should take a stand or go along.The look is even beyond Merchant/Ivory retro feasts, absolutely beautiful settings, costumes, a visual feast. For example, a scene from the 1936 Olympics mingles newsreel film with ersatz recreated newsreel film and new color scenes as the camera follows the crowds in Nazi uniforms.

He and Marta Meszaros have been the leading Hungarian film directors for decades. This is his masterpiece. Nearly three hours long (although eight minutes have been cut from the released version for the DVD version), it still seems incomplete, as if it should have been a six-hour television series. It is in the great tradition of German and Central European 'family saga' stories, of which the most famous is the novel 'Buddenbrooks' by Thomas Mann. Although the family in this film is Jewish, named Sonnenschein ('sunshine'), this is absolutely not a holocaust film. There are no scenes in concentration camps, but one extremely harrowing scene at a round-up point for Jews bound for one. If the Jewish theme is anything, it is that of the futility of attempts at assimilation. The Sonnenscheins of Hungary do everything they can to assimilate, changing their name to Sors (a Hungarian name), and even converting to Roman Catholicism. But it is all to no avail. The anti-Semitism is so ubiquitous, so relentless, so maniacal, that all efforts are dashed. However, the Nazi era is just one era in this family saga. We are taken through the Imperial era, and later the Communist Era both pre-1956 and post-1956 up to 'the present'. Ralph Fiennes accomplishes one of the greatest feats possible, of playing three successive generations of men of the same family! He does this with total success, and thereby proves himself a true acting genius. Valerie Sonnenschein/Sors is played when young by Jennifer Ehle, and when old by her real-life mother, Rosemary Harris. It is hard to remember a finer performance by either. Szabo must be a truly inspiring director for his actors. This film was very personal to him, and the huge flat where the Sonneschein/Sors family live is the one where Szabo himself grew up as a child. Bill Paterson delivers a wonderful performance, and as someone who is so quintessentially British, to appear successfully as a Hungarian was an astonishing feat. Rachel Weisz gives an intense and passionate performance, as one would expect from her. The story is original from Szabo, who did the first version of the script, but the final screenplay was evidently by that friend of my youth, Israel (Artie') Horovitz. I still have the hand-mimeographed copy he gave me of what I believe was his first one-act play, 'The Hanging of Emmanuel', asking for my opinion at the time. I can give him one of this film now if he had done nothing else in his lifetime but write this magnificent screenplay, he could walk tall and proud through all of his days. If only this film could be shown in schools, to educate the ignorant young who now know nothing about what happened more than five minutes ago! This film is a testament, and testaments are what we need above all today when he have a failure of collective memory in society, and when people live only in a present of a few minutes' duration, oblivious of both past and future as if they were dumb beasts or even insensate plants.

The men of the family (three of them played by Ralph Feinnes!) are invariably emotionally repressed; the women both sensual and strong.  The same dilemmas repeat themselves over and over to what extent to assimilate and compromise; whether to conform or revolt. The grand historical sweep helps maintain interest; but inevitably leads to an absence of tautness in the plot, which unfolds linearly for over three hours.The film has other problems too.  A largely Anglophile cast struggles to convince as central Europeans; the dialogue is wooden and didactic; while potentially mighty tales are clumsily reduced to a few sequential scenes presenting merely a schematic outline, often in a heavy-handed and obvious manner.  In some ways this is history as written in the textbooks; slightly impersonal, with emblematic characters chosen to accentuate each lesson.

That is not the approach I want to take. I wish to speak to the legacy of identification with the aggressor that is exhibited in all the leading men. We see in this film how, in order to survive, one can lose one's true identity in order to assume an identity that will allow survival. That alone is not very interesting. What is interesting is that the dynamic does not stop there but goes well beyond mere survival to actually becoming identified with the oppressor. We see in the film that in order to carry the illusion of power in powerless situations the Fiennes characters persecute the very people he (in his three many roles) comes from and loves. Is this because of a family legacy of cowardice or is this a fact of the human condition? Its a convincing story and should make us all wary of how we might identify as powerful at the expense of others in order to deny our own fragility.

This sounds a grand plan and mostly works, it being quite clear when a new era has been started, with Fiennes narrating a cross-over sort of stitching of stories, aided by newsreel to help us place it, time-wise.Probably Hungary's most successful director, István Szabó has used English here, whereas two of his previous films that follow many of the themes explored here that I have seen and own, are in Hungarian the Oscar winning (Foreign Language) Mephisto and later Colonel Redl. These starred the Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer in brilliant and memorable performances.However, especially when comparing to the earlier Brandauer films, this structure is its slight undoing. However hard Fiennes tries - and he is forced into some quite nasty, humiliating scenes, he is never on the levels attained by Brandauer. This time-frame structure also makes the three hour run-time slacken, the film lacks the urgency and tightness of the Hungarian films and whilst in English, with some familiar faces, it lacks the authenticity, too. However, at least having all the cast speaking the same 'region-free' English dialogue means it is not jarred by a sudden American one, which would spoil it, a bit.However, the story remains an interesting one and the mood and feel never less than authentically and superbly realised, whilst handsome use of locations such as Vienna, Paris, Berlin and Budapest make for a visual feast. I've now just seen the film for the third time.If you're expecting a nice, twee and gentle period drama, leave this one well alone - Szabó has always gone for realism - often graphically. Expect torture, nudity and very strong language - it all fits in and is never gratuitous but this does mean it's not one for Sunday afternoon with grandma and the kids.I would also definitely recommend the two Hungarian Szabó's that I mention - Mephisto is easier to buy and is critically very admired. Colonel Redl I had to buy as a Korean import but that is a good transfer at a good price, if you can find an outlet.

Istvan Szabo) Sprawling novelistic historical           epic of 3 generations of Hungarian Jews, circa           ~1900-1950, which at 180 min. is still not long enough,           which is to say that it's much too ambitious in scope           and lacking in depth. Quantity has never been a           substitute for quality; this is really two movies           crammed into one, neither one satisfactory, neither           done justice. As with a Mahlerian symphony it's           difficult to sustain unity and cohesion over so much           material, a requirement Szabo fails at, losing his grip           somewhere at midpoint (the fencing Olympics). Published           reviews have compared it to soap opera plot overpowers           character.          Ralph Fiennes plays the lead protagonist of all 3           generations, and it's hard to tell his characters           apart, they're all so similar, all           stiff-backed intense ideologues mistakenly loyal to           whatever governing elite happens to be in power at the           expense of their own people, the Jews, which is the           moral hammered in repeatedly for 3 hours.          The movie self-consciously borrows literary techniques,           e.g., leitmotif and symbolism (e.g.'s, the family name;           the elixir responsible for the family's wealth; broken           china as curse), in fact almost reads like a Romantic           19th century novel, but ends up suffering for it, ends           up somewhat stilted and heavy. Too many scenes are           cinematically static, coming off as theatrical and           stagy, wordy and expository like an old movie. Some           are so patently Romantic as to be corny--e.g., when the           courtyard pavement breaks out with yellow flowers to           signify that someone is in love. Still, for all the           frantic shtupping--an there's certainly an abundance of           lusty women throwing themselves at Fiennes--there's a           curious lack of spark, of passion, of sexuality even.           There is, however, one unforgettable image the frozen           body hanging from a tree.          Recommended for those who like TV miniseries and/or to           escape into operatic historical novels. "}{"Title":" Brilliant, but deeply flawed.

But any power for illuminating any one of these is lost in the conflating of them together. One after another, the Fienes characters deny these each in order with the drama seemingly underscoring that the penalties for each are the same that the commitment of one denial curses the world of the other. But it is all so murky in the dynamics. The only link is this much-mentioned dynamic ofcurse. (This gets dangerously close to the slander that Jews were responsible for their own plight.) At some points, the director seems to push love/faith as the enduring value, then (including low smaltz at the end) faith. A lot of people went to a lot of trouble to make this film, and one must wonder what they thought they were creating. Great art of the type this tries for, has us leaving the theater pondering questions (while other types of film might go for assimilating the new experiences). But nothing is well defined here. Fienes was best in Oscar and Lucinda where he was confident in what he was about. He is obviously a great actor, but just as obviously is confused here about what he is to convey.

I have seen and greatly enjoyed 'Hanussen' and 'Mephisto' which both feature his preferred actor, the fantastic Klaus Maria Brandauer . The latest is nothing less than a masterpiece in my opinion, a strong parable about the relation between dictatorship and art, between power and the artist, and a meditation about the human character and the tearing dilemma of the artist who has to chose between being silent and being silenced. What few people knew at the time the film was released was that in 'Mephisto' Szabo had spoken about his own life and choices.I somehow failed to see until now 'Sunshine' which is a not less ambitious endeavor describing in a big epic film the story of one Jewish Hungarian family which is symbolic for much of the history of the Hungarian Jews in the 20th century.They do not do such films any longer, some may say. 'Sunshine' is a saga spread over three generations of the Sonnenshein / Sors family - a family of Jewish origin whose story is followed since the last two decades of the Austro-Hungarian empire through the First World War, the Communist revolution of 1919, the inter-wars period, the horrors of the Second World War and of the Holocaust, the Communist terror that followed. The tradition of such stories is actually not rooted in Hollywood but rather in the solid novel sagas of writers like Thomas Mann or John Galsworthy. The main theme is the fate of the Jewish family trying to find its identity first in the relatively liberal Austro-Hungarian empire, the tentative to melt its identity by 'assimilation' and conversion, followed by the cruel return to reality during the Holocaust, and the temporary illusion of salvation by adopting the principles of the internationalist Communism.The 16 years that passed since the film was released make the demonstration of the futility of the identity hiding games played by Jews in Europe in general and Hungary in particular look somehow didactic on screen (but not in reality, as recent events show). Istvan Szabo had the bright idea of distributing Ralph Fiennes in the triple role of the three men in the three generations of the Sonnenschein / Sors family. Fiennes is a fine actor and this was one of his best roles, but the real strong and persistent character is the one of Valerie - wife, mother, and grandmother and more than all the survivor and the strong character that represents the moral and tradition compass of the whole family during the succeeding storms of the century. Two actresses - Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris play this role at different ages. They are both wonderful. The strength of the film comes however from the accumulation of facts and the building of the emotion that leads to the final rediscovery of the true identity of the character.

Six years after his memorable turn as Nazi Amon Goeth in the award winning Schindler's List, he is at it again, but this time as a member of a Jewish family, taking several parts through the ages leading to the holocaust in Hungary as well as life there after World War 11.The picture is absolutely amazing. It makes you wonder when the family is seen as ultra-religious in years past and then getting progressively less religious with the passing years. You think you've reached the ultimate after the intermarriages begin to take place, only to be followed by the holocaust, where even Baptismal certificates did the newly converted Christians any good. They met their fate in a horrible way. The films proves that you really can't change who you are.

The film does a nice job examining issues of identity, religion, ethnicity and assimilation and a minority group's quest for acceptance by the majority population. All of these are important and complex issues, but unfortunately the film potentially undermines its credibility by indulging in a somewhat kitsch, romantic storyline. Sunshine is ultimately a work of fiction, but since it deals with major, dramatic moments in Europe's recent past--such as the upheaval following World War I, anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, the Communist take-over and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution--less of a focus on the romantic saga and more attention to the historical events themselves (as experienced by one family) would do justice to the dramatic history of Hungary in the twentieth century.On a positive note, the directors of this film should be applauded for providing English audiences with a synopsis of Central Europe's recent past-- a region which otherwise often features as a mere footnote in North American history textbooks.

The only reason I don't give this movie a perfect 10 out of 10 is because we definitely needed to see Gretta (played by one of my favorite British actresses Rachel Weisz)manipulate the Sors family more. Weisz did a great job with what she had to work with, but I would have loved to see her character last longer and develop into more of a heartless, mean woman than one that's desperate for love.

In a book, it is easy to deal with each generation easily; in a film, the effort tends to be overwhelming. The result, for me, was that each generation looked like the other, and not simply because one actor played all the parts. Its just too much to ask a viewer to absorb in one sitting. The picture is a visual treat, to be sure. And it is well played. Its just too much subject for the medium.The tragedy of the family's efforts to be assimilated into a society that wouldn't take them is heart breaking.

Fiennes really is outstanding as the various generations of Sonnenscheins/Sors. The seam between Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris is undetectable as they share the character of Valerie Sors (something, perhaps, to do with the fact that they are daughter and mother).

While some forty years had passed on the screen, I felt that that's how long I'd been sitting in my seat.Okay, I exaggerate, but, overall, I felt that, while the movie had many scenes of great beauty, it was in great need of some judicious editing. The sword-fighting sequences, for example; well-done, yes, but why so much time spent on them?

It has received good/mixed, but generally unenthusiastic reviews.It's the film many would certainly prefer to MI2 or Perfect Storm, or The Patriot, or Shaft! And let me add quickly the film is in ENGLISH and is not subtitled. Ralph Fiennes plays three different roles in the film (ancestors of each other) and amazingly creates distinct characters with each performance. William Hurt in a supporting role is even good.The bad news is, half the film covers well worn territory (particularly in the second half) and occasionally does so in the most obvious and self conscious way . On occasion very flat notes are hit. It's also so ambitious, at times the emotional impact of some turns are barely touched upon. However, there are at least a dozen wonderful realized moments/scenes in the film that far outweighed the flaws of the film. During the first hour in particular the manner in which the story is told is superb. The acting is also quite good. It's an epic film spanning more than three generations of a Hungarian Jewish family from the 1840's through the 60's. The rather melodramatic twists and turns that are revealed are often surprising, sometimes joyous, sometimes tragic,and often both. The script by Isreal Horovitz and director Szabo covers a remarkable amount of territory and does so by allowing the story to be told by an ancestor of the family. It's sumptiously photographed. Power and Lust corrupts and leads to tragedy. Resisting Power and Lust is what God asks and in return rewards one with increased knowledge,         understanding and family love says a family elder early in the picture. But he is not entirely correct .  All of the international cast are quite good. Jennifer Ehle as Valerie in particular reminded me of Julianna Moore at her best (resembling her a great deal). Rosemary Harris who plays the older Valerie (is in real life Ehle's Mom !!!) is also superb. Ralph Fiennes plays three self absorbed, naive idealist/traditionalists who are pursued by women who refuse to be suffocated by life or current relationships. Lust, fame, fortune, respect, and even power knock at the door over and over again. So does prejudice, guilt, tragedy, deceit, betrayal and hate.Rather than tell too much about this three hour epic, strongly recommend you find out where it's playing and go see it.

But the women, particularly Valerie represent a kind of steadiness. Although they always give up something, their principles pass the historic periods while the men engage in politics. The love affairs tell a lot everything the period.The film also says about people of which members are very talented, very adaptable, very succesful but this is why, they can be victims easily and willing to serve a regime, governments and go with the tide/current scream.In the film Ignatz-the grandfather- lives in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which was the second biggest state of Europe from 1867-1918 and which was divided in Trianon.

This controversial and taboo act plagues Ignatz as he becomes chancellor to the Emperor of Hungary. He eventually ignores the taboo and marries his true love ignoring his father's warnings of a curse. As Hungary enters World War I, Ignatz ends up alone and disgraced as the Emperor is overthrown by a dictatorship.As the film uncovers the next two generations of Sonnenschein's we begin to see the dysfunction of a troubled family and its struggle to remain together. Ralph Fiennes continues as the next two figureheads of the Sonnenshein family as they struggle through both World Wars and a complete metamorphosis of soul, morals and religion. Sunshine is one of those period pieces heavily laced in history that would appeal to all history buffs but its message and length may become overwhelming for the average movie-goer. Ralph Fiennes continues to amaze us as he is so strong and brilliant in this film. Director István Szabó's sweeping camera shots and attention detail really does make us think how far will these people go. His amazing `Rocky' type fencing scenes during the Olympic Games were amazing and a real hi-light of the film. Then in a complete reverse we are faced with  a `no holds barred' Nazi torture scene that is a little hard on the eyes and stomach. Its gripping, shocking and a real test for Fiennes. Szabo covered all the extremes as the family desperately tries to change with the evolving country. Sunshine's main flaw has to be its ability to keep the viewer interested for 3 hours and some change. There is very little suspense or intrigue to hold the film together. Sunshine works as a family tree brought to life. When I finished watching I wondered what the film was trying to say exactly. But I came to the conclusion that it's detailed in the struggle. The family's struggle echoed and accented Hungary's evolution from monarchy to the Iron Curtain. With the fall of the Iron Curtain there seems to be one more generation of Sonnenschien's left to explore. (3.5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.

The next 3 generations of Sonnenschein men are profiled, in what amounts to 3 separate one-hour films, with Ralph Fiennes playing the male lead in each one - Ignaz, his son Adam, and his son Ivan. The story covers approximately 80 years in Hungary, from about 1880 to about 1960, and historically through Hitler, Stalin, and Lenin.We begin with Ignaz, who became a prominent politician and who was in love with his cousin, and adopted sister, beautiful red-haired Valerie. She became pregnant, they were married, in spite of the family's displeasure. After a hint that Ignaz might go further in his career without a Jewish name, he changed it to Sors ('schorsch'), as did his siblings.Next is Adam, who is a successful lawyer and fencer. He joins the national team, and becomes the gold medalist at Hitler's 1936 Olympics. He is drawn into an affair with his brother's wife. Imprisoned during the war, is hung outside and hosed down until frozen to death, witnessed by his son, Ivan.Ivan grows up to become a Communist policemen. He seeks out and has a torrid love affair with a Communist hero's wife. William Hurt plays one of his countrymen who Ivan must eventually question for subversive activities.  Then Ivan is thrown in jail for 3 years, when he gets out goes back to his original home, granny Valerie says, Politics has made a mess of our lives. When everyone else dies and he cleans out the house, the Sunshine recipe book falls on the ground, is eventually thrown into the garbage to be lost forever. He changes his name back to Sonnenschein to complete the cycle and get on with being who he really is.   This is a story of a Jewish family searching for success and happiness in a changing world not always kind to Jews. In a brilliant casting move, Jennifer Ehle and her mother, Rosemary Harris, play the young adult and the older Valerie. Their family looks are so similar it really seems like we are seeing 60 years of one person's life.

Of course, we would not, in this case, been able to have such performances as those of Ralph Fiennes, but doing it thus would have, in my opinion, made the film even more realistic and gripping.

Unfortunately, the end result is contemptible. Three major flaws are at the root of this failed continuity, miscasting and upset footage mixing.The film tells the short but eventful history of Hungary shown through the eyes of three generations of the family Sonnenschein/Sors. Major events are squeezed in less than minutes and important characters are studied only superficially. For instance, when father and son Sors end up in a Nazi concentration camp, the only scene that's included is when the camp leaders kill the father in a horrendous manner while helplessly watched by the son (one of the most intense scenes of the movie). Okay, that was the concentration camp, on to the next scene. No time is taken to delve into the psyche of a traumatized concentration camp survivor, no time to watch things unfold, as if in a great hurry. The same is true for most of the important events taking place in the lives of the protagonists.Adding to the confusion is the fact that the father, the son and the grandson are all played by the same actor, Ralph Fiennes. Undistinguishable, I must say. Adding a mustache doesn't help here Fiennes remains the same aloof, uninspiring character in all three roles. I am certainly not impressed with his acting skills, although it can always be worse, as evidenced by his zero-talented brother Joseph. Still, only the best of the best actors can manage to remain credible in three different roles in one and the same movie.Another facet which irritated and simultaneously bemused me was the incorporation of present-day shots into old footage, antiquing contemporary sequences as though it would ever fit in with the shaky, unreproducible images of days gone by. And then, still imprisoned in this fake imagery, Fiennes holds a speech.

What makes it compelling, however, is that it is about choices and compromises one makes in life. Ignatz (the grandfather) is criticized for starting the family trend of assimilation and appeasement of the establishment. I came away with the opposite sense, that he was courageous and right in defending an empire that does turn out to have been more liberal and tolerant than anything that followed it. He was correct to be wary of the Communists' promises and to help uphold the rule of an emperor who was doing his imperfect best to keep a diverse group of nations together in harmony. Not only that, Ignatz does so with a principled attitude and unwavering ethics. Why is his stance panned? He did rise to the top of his field -- and a very powerful one at that -- with one symbolic if emotionally charged concession, his last name.

This name literally translates to Sunshine.  The family has humble beginnings, then is prosperous, becomes upwardly mobile, changes it's name, and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally.  The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles.  For those who missed the WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, the Sonnenschein' approach to life doesn't work out very well.Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success, but it is an opportunity missed.  The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage.  The family 'plot' lurches from one predictable event ie. the Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc. to the next with little continuity, depth or detail.  The Jewish assimilation theme is unfocused, and important sub-themes the 'secret' diary and family philosophy that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end.  Alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material.  The 3 for 1 casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. Sunshine is basically Hungarian History Channel material.  It has the look and feel of Winds of War morphed with Forrest Gump morphed with Something About Sex.

The movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional, but alas it became so boringly long that I can only give it a 2 of 10.  It is way below average.Some other problems also exist in this marathon.  1) Ralph Fiennes plays a whole family tree.  The guy who played the Great-grandfather looks nothing like him, but the Grandfather, Father and the son (who gives us constant unneeded voice over) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull-headed personality.  No one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last, even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn. This one is minor, but if the movie hadn't been 3 weeks long it wouldn't have been so annoying.2) The fact that no news from Germany was even whispered for the longest time about Jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous.  Some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed.  The uncle in France would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave.3) The love stories in this movie are totally wrong.  You are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short.  Suddenly... people are in love and almost instantly... married. Then having children.  Then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships.  This again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie, but with time spent nothing was given to us.4) The ending was just bad.

The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister?  If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.

The aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn-out never-ending story line which really seems to go nowhere.In short, a waste of talent and film.

Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children.  Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island.  But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers.
