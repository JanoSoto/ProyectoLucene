Considering the title and the premise one would not expect to see a smart film that never bashes its characters, but instead fully develops them in an a thoughtful, original manner. This film manages to do just this. Lara Flynn Boyle is both sexy and extremely funny. Josh Charles turns in a tender, compassionate performance. Film could have just easily come off as gratitous, but instead it is sexy and fun.Rated R; Sexual Situations and Profanity.

She begins to fall in love with Eddy but he reveals to her that he's gay--maybe (he's still a virgin). They all become fast friends and make a pact NOT to have sex with each other. But Alex is still in love with Eddy--and Eddy is very attracted to hunky Stuart...Almost perfect comedy/drama. For its time, this was groundbreaking. This was a rare Hollywood film that brought up gay characters and issues and did NOT ignore them or miraculously make the character straight. SPOILER ALERT!!!!! It is revealed that Eddy IS gay and is happily with a boyfriend at the end of the movie! I remember seeing this in a theatre and being stunned in 1994. NO Hollywood film had ever done that before (letting a gay character stay gay AND be happy). Even today that's a rare occurrence--back in 1994 it was unheard of. For this alone this movie should be better known. END SPOILER ALERT!!!Sexual politics aside it's also a damn funny movie. The characters are believable, the dialogue is frank and VERY adult (this is NOT for kids) and the movie moves quickly--never a dull moment. Boyle was young (24) when she made this. Her performance is great and she looks incredible (unlike now where she looks seriously anorexic); Charles is letter perfect as Eddy--you see has pain and conflict as he comes to terms with his sexuality; even Baldwin is good! His character is an obnoxious jerk but he has his sweet moments and really pulls them off. But it's his character that prevents me from giving this movie a 10. His character IS a real jerk and his sick jokes and comments really wore me down. Also there is a scene between him and Charles which is just bristling with homo eroticism--and the film stops it. I can accept that though--back in 1994 a mainstream audience couldn't have dealt with two guys going at it.Sadly this film bombed in 1994 (a bad ad campaign didn't help matters). This Definitely deserves rediscovery. Exceptional film that deals honestly with college kids and sexual politics. Well worth seeing.

It is funny, understanding, believable, exploring what, for some, would be dark sides of friendship, love and sex, but in a light and amiable way. The I-word strikes again in its deep sensitivity for what human relationships are like and, most of all, there is no morality tacked on at the end. In a different way, it reminded me of the superb French movie Le p√©ril jeune, which dwelt on a bunch of adolescents at the end of the sixties. Check it out .

I think it was a much under-appreciated film that, in its own, pop-culture way, is even very brave. Josh Charles and Lara Flynn Boyle, both actors I always enjoy, give strong, genuine performances and Stephen Baldwin does his best acting outside of THE USUAL SUSPECTS. The best thing about the film, however, is Andrew Flemming's screenplay, which is highly literate, witty, extremely aware of itself, it's situation and the nature of its characters, and is studded with some beautiful little gems of sensitivity, understanding and wisdom. Though some people might dismiss it as fluff, the issues of sexuality, confusion and desire being presented are extremely well-handled, and Flemming is very good at addressing them intelligently, through his characters, without ever abandoning believability- especially in regards to how college kids talk and think. Also, a gold star for the portrayal of a gay man who is not flamboyant, dying or AIDS, or stupidly following the heroine around playing confidante; another for exploring the darker, stranger side of the woman-male homosexual relationship so often glamorized in Hollywood; a third for addressing that taboo subject so often dropped from teenage and twenty-something sex comedies guilt. All in all, a fun, enjoyable movie- with a nice, thought provoking kick in the stomach to make it really worth your time.

He has something very special in his acting and I simply think he is remarkable. Lara Flynn Boile is no doubt a goddess with respectable acting abilities and even Will Baldwin, who plays a very flat but funny character, pleases the audience. As a group they even go beyond and the result is a romantic comedy with lots of sex appeal, laughing, friendship and even some seriousness.

This can be either its validation or its weak point, because even when the three main characters wind up in bed together and apparently break the friendship bond and consummate their sexual tension, that we aren't allowed to see it and experience it is the only moment when it seems to cheat and retrace its steps cautiously. Because of course, one of the men is Stephen Baldwin, and it would be compromising if he had kissed his co-star Josh Charles, so we only will see him have sex with Lara Flynn Boyle. However, the material is well done, the characters are well drawn -- except for having Alexis Arquette as a more flamboyant gay college student in for laughs than as an actual person -- and the viewing experience translates at times quite poignantly through Charles' voice-overs as he wistfully looks back at those college days that are now gone by.

Andrew Fleming's screenplay is a near perfect one; so good, in fact, that it would be a terrific play. I had similar experiences in college coming out as a gay man and exploring the tangled web of sex and romance. Fleming gets it so right! You cringe at most teen and college movies that Hollywood passes off these days, but this film is an independent gesture at delving into relationships and characters. It was under appreciated in 1994.  On DVD it plays like a masterwork.I must also praise Josh Charles, whose work in this film is also completely right and real. An underated actor, he makes Eddie's dilemmas heartbreaking and humorous at the same time. He should be doing alot more movies!!! Steven Baldwin is a bit over the top at times, but he creates an endearing jock who has moments of sincerity that are rarely seen in this character type. You've got to love his sheer exuberance in the part! And Lara Flynn Boyle gives a multi-textured performance of such nuance that it is a constant marvel watching her in this film.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this movie, is that it almost seems totally improvised; it's natural, fun, and a very true slice of college life. It's also a great coming of age/coming out movie that refreshingly has a gay protagonist who isn't a queen, dying of AIDS, or singing musicals!!!  HALLELUJAH!

You like these characters, feel with them and believe that they would get along in real life like they do in the movie. The concept is clearly quite controversial, and I guess that's why it's so unpopular. I like the way it isn't really all resolved in the end... there is always a tiny degree of imperfection. The plot at times appears to have been written with the primary intention of being controversial rather than entirely realistic, emotionally or otherwise. I'm not sure if that's true, or it just seems that way. The pacing is pretty good. You're rarely bored. The clever dialog and script keeps your interest as well as consistently making you laugh. The film somehow makes you care about these characters, despite their many shortcomings and flaws. Maybe it's because they're human... we can identify with them, more than usually with American films(that are often shallow). The direction is pretty good. The film pretty much belongs in the 'good, but not entirely sure why' category. You like what you see, but you can't pin-point exactly why. All in all, a pretty good romance-comedy that should be seen by anyone open-minded enough to enjoy it. I recommend this to anyone who isn't offended by the topic(and not easily offended in general) but particularly to those who are fans of one or more of the main actors. 7/10 "},{"Title":"amusing","Date":"11 January 2004","Score":"9 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Drama","Review":"  This is a pretty good little movie about very close roommates.

I was expecting a rather cheesy film in which we see all the predictable sexual quandries you might expect out of a comedy like this. I wasn't entirely wrong, but I was rather pleasantly surprised, as well.Eddy (Josh Charles) is sexually ambiguous - ie. homosexual, as he eventually admits, although he is a virgin and not entirely sure. Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) has a huge crush on him. And his somewhat misogynistic and lustful roommate, Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) lusts after Alex, while Eddy lusts after him. They make a vow to be just friends. Of course, this all backfires.What pleasantly surprised me was the conclusion to the film, and the tender and delicate nature with which they handled the sexual issues that cropped up. It was also extremely funny at times, especially when the dorm supervisors (Alexis Arquette, Martha Gehman) start spying on the three of them and wondering what the hell is going on.The directing is standard for a film of this nature - essentially a romantic comedy with a twist. The lead roles were all extremely well played, especially Josh Charles as the narrator and most crucial role of the film. The sex in the film was erotic when it needed to be, tender when it needed to be, and animalistic when it needed to be, and never overwhelming or out of context.It also was one of the most realistic and intelligent commentaries I've ever seen on the reality of college life - at least, undergraduate life. How I've experienced it, at any rate. The dialogue, so crucial to a film like this, is extremely appropriate and well-done, and the actors deliver it with perfection. It's a film that is almost entirely about dialogue - despite the sexual nature of the film, there's little nudity and certainly never anything that could be considered gratuitous. It's not the greatest film I've seen, but it's among the most well-written films I've seen in the past few years.A pleasant and amusing film. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

In another scene Eddie has a theory about Stuart and refers to several things that Stuart said to support his theory. However, we never saw the original scenes where Stuart made these statements.

The humor is very clever and mature (compared to say, a Will Farrell style college movie). I love the narration by the Eddy character, it makes this movie so much more. He makes you really feel what he's feeling. All three characters take you on their journey of self discovery, a bit of sexual experimentation that often occurs while in college, and most of all - the painful truth about How can someone be such a necessary part of one's life one moment, and simply vanish the next? How true is that?! One should also note the amazing original score by Thomas Newman. He's composed music for a ton of other movies too such as American Beauty, Pay It Forward, Erin Brockovich - just to scratch the surface. I recently became obsessed with finding this music, that is NOT included on the Threesome soundtrack (although the non-original music on that CD is a great compilation, including U2's Dancing Barefoot - a phenomenal song). I found it just this week if anyone else has been going crazy trying to find this music. It's on the American Buffalo soundtrack. The first half of the CD the score for American Buffalo score (which is pretty mediocre), and the last half is the original score to Threesome! Anyway, I think all three characters are VERY well played by the actors, even Stephen Baldwin - although I'm sure the role of the obnoxious, sex-obsessed roommate was tailor-made for the guy at that time. I love his and all the characters, and wouldn't change a thing about how they contribute to the three-way relationship that's formed as well as the story line.This movie is also very believable, a quality I love and a quality that keeps me from watching overly melodramatic classics like Gone With the Wind. I just don't believe the characters in those types of movies! So if you saw Threesome before and only thought it was so-so, give it another chance. Try to see it with new eyes, and for the love of God, listen to the original music when you can catch it. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. The DVD offers a couple of alternate endings, but I like the one they ultimately chose best. So it's not the happiest of endings, it's an extremely realistic ending. I was left completely satisfied.

Lara Flynn Boyle as Alex, who gets a room in a students house together with two boys, falls in love with one of the guys, Josh Charles, which acting as the sensitive and sexually undecided part is very good too. And there is Stephen Baldwin, a Stifler-like character, who¬¥s meaning of life is getting as much women as possible. I guess this is the most easy part to play for an actor, but nevertheless Baldwin did a good job too. So Alex loves Eddy, Eddy loves Stuart and Stuart loves Alex. Any questions left? This is a pretty good situation for many crazy things to happen ... and they do happen!So if you like funny Student/Teen-Comedy with a little bit more story and depth than most movies in this Genre, you can¬¥t do anything wrong.Along with Analyze this and the American Pies, one of my favorite comedy, 8 out of 10 points.P.S.

After I saw this film I was so excited about going to college and meeting new people. Threesome is funny, deep, inspirational and even a bit therapeutic for some kids. Plus it touches a very controversial topic. The over-all plot will be considered weak by most, but look for the complete meaning and think back to when you were that age.

I suspect you have to be American, or have an American sensibility, to fully appreciate this film. I can easily see Europeans wondering what there is to be conflicted about, and I can see people from developing countries finding it a depiction of something that could never happen. Believe me, it can and does. The three young actors, all now much better known for other roles, play characters who will seem very real to you--especially if you can remember back to the sturm and drang of your college years.The dialog is as sharp and clever as anything you will hear anywhere. There is a scene where a naive girl, who has been brought to a threesome dinner party by one of the boys, flees the room in tears. Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) gives a raucous, malicious laugh and then says dryly, I like her. It's a stunning moment, and drop dead funny.I hope this film eventually gets the attention it deserves. It is seriously neglected, certainly one of the most entertaining movies of its decade. In the gay community, this movie seems pretty much unknown.

I have nothing really bad to say about it except for the fact that it didn't get me involved in the storyline all that much. On the plus side, the movie was surprisingly mature in alot of places.

Films like this are very rare to witness these days where the plot is very simplified and revolves around just three college friends and their self discoveries. Very, in fact very rare films focus on college life in such a close manner and this film is much more than just three college friends in a room. In brief, 'Threesome' is the perfect example of a simplified cinema with a neat and perfect execution in every sense, from the precise direction by Andrew Fleming to the brilliant performances by Josh Charles, Lara Boyle and Stephen Baldwin.Charles, Boyle and Baldwin deliver one of their very best performances here, easily giving you the impression that you are just witnessing three friends and not the actors. The chemistry between these three is very touching and strong enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, making you a part of their journey throughout the film. Its a film that gets better and better on repeated viewings, trust me you will never get enough of it, its really a ride. A 9.9 out of 10!

It isn't, not at all.So half the people, the ones that wanted it to be a porn film, are disappointed, and the other half, without even having bothered seeing the film, say that it's immoral.This isn't a porn film at all. It's about friendship. It's one of the most on-the-mark movies about friendship that I've ever seen.Is there sex involved? Yes, of course. In case you've never noticed, we (and every other critter on the planet) are sexual beings, it's an urge in all of us.And if anyone would actually watch the film and just pay attention, it isn't all about overcoming inhibitions and setting free your desires; by the end of the film it becomes apparent that there are prices to be paid. (Well, I guess that was a spoiler, of sorts. But what's with this spoiler thing, anyway? There isn't a film book in the world that discusses, say, Psycho without giving away the ending! Since when has it become so important to not say anything about the movie? Hell, Threesome is about two guys and a girl...SHHH!!! You're spoiling it for me! LOL) Anyway, it has a very witty yet believable script and wonderful performances by all the actors (including, I must add, one of the most erotic scenes I've ever seen in my life, the one in the library. This might not be porn, but Lara was hot as hell back then!) And, by the end (if you're paying attention, and not assuming or hoping that it was a porn film) you're left on this terribly moving bittersweet note. Times change, people move on.This was a wonderful movie (if misunderstood), much better than its immediate rival that came out around the same time, Reality Bites. In the end, the thing that the film is truly about is how ephemeral things can be. It can't show you, vividly, how things can fall apart, it can't make you feel for them or what will happen to and between them without spending the first 80 or so minutes putting them together. After all of that, you realize the tragedy and frailty of friendships and loves.And, in the end, that is truly what the movie is about.And, in the end, that's what life is all about.

I remember watching this thing when it first came out and while this viewing didn't live up to what I remembered, I was still surprised at how well it did hold up all these years later. I think the film, unlike many, tried to be serious about it's subject matter and the three relationships that eventually evolve over the running time. For the most part the film doesn't hit any false moments as you will really feel as if you are watching three different characters come into their own while at college when sex is running free. The screenplay by director Fleming does a nice job at developing all three characters and their relationships with one another. I think the film doesn't shy away from its subject and in the end we're greeting to quite a few dramatic moments as well as some very funny ones. I think the running joke about all the pizza being eaten could have been left out but I don't fault the film too much for this. The performances by the three leads are quite effective with both Boyle and Charles really shining in their roles. Both of them handles their roles perfectly well with Boyle nailing the confusion and frustration of her character and Charles really coming off well as someone who doesn't know who he is. Baldwin adds a lot of laughter as the sex hungry male.

On a Swedish cable-channel called ZTV it was this film, Threesome. It wasn't anything else on so we started watching. Pretty soon you got to know that you knew the persons who played the main-characters called Eddy, Alex and Stuart. Eddy I recognized from Dead Poet's Society. Alex was played by Lara Flynn Boyle (Wayne's World, Twin Peaks, Happiness) and she over did in this film so much. I didn't even like her character in Happiness. But this was even worse. And then there was Stuart played by Stephen Baldwin who hasn't got much but B-Movies like Half Baked and Bio-Dome on his conscious, with the exception of The Usual Suspects. Anyways, they play three friends who live together. And a lot of problems come with that. I don't really know if Threesome is suppose to be a comedy. It was the first impression, even though I didn't laugh more than a couple of times. They try to mix it with dramatic and somewhat controversial issues such as bisexuality and sexual threesome. A lot of the film wasn't more than a stupid excuse to show this threesome. It's a typical, early-/mid 90's film if you look at the colors and the clothes they wear and the music. The theme of the film isn't that unusual. Threesome is about finding out who you are and all that. And finding out who your friends are, and what they are. They've spiced it up a little with Eddy's voice-over. A classic way of making it all a bit more sentimental. But it has all been done before, and those guys or girls have done it better. This time a threesome supposed to be the special thing about this film. And I guess they were trying to make the scene beautiful. But it failed. Later on the director made Dick with Kirsten Dunst.
