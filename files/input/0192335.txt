[{"Title":"It's not what I found, but what I didn't find that blew me away.","Date":"28 October 2001","Score":"40 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Biography","Review":"  This documentary presents the story of the rise and fall of Fred Leuchter, an apparently self-taught engineer specializing in the repair and fabrication of instruments of capital punishment.  His choice to develop evidence to deny the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz, Poland causes a descent into villainy and subsequent ostracism from his clients and his wife.Several of Leuchter's detractors are interviewed in the film and vilify him as an anti-Semite and a perpetrator of a cruel hoax.  His supporters portray him as the second coming of Christ and a man worthy of equal footing with George Washington.  If Leuchter actually was aware of his place in the events that led to his downfall, then one could assume he falls somewhere between the two extremes.  But this film amply demonstrates that in many ways, Fred in a class by himself.  This little man from Massachusetts grew up around the prison where his father worked, and he saw the daily life of both inmates and guards.  He came to see both groups as his friends, and later in his life he chose to research ways to make execution equipment safer and more humane, not only for the inmates being executed, but also for the guards that have to deal with the psychologically disturbing business of execution.Over time, he became prominent in his field, and was recognized as perhaps the only expert in the United States on repairing and building execution devices.  It was this expertise that drew the attention of holocaust denier Ernst Zundel, who was on trial in Canada for publishing a document entitled Did Six Million Really Die?, which the government of Canada argued was published with deliberate lies about Nazi execution of Jews.  Leuchter was approached as an expert on execution and was asked to journey to Auschwitz to develop evidence to disprove that the crematories at that most infamous of concentration camps was used as execution chambers.It is here that the mystery of Fred Leuchter begins.  In the film, a holocaust denier relates a conversation he had with Leuchter in which he had asked Fred about his illegal and highly distasteful excavations at Auschwitz.  Leuchter replied, It wasn't what I found, but what I didn't find that blew me away.  It is this statement that rings in my head when I try to examine Fred Leuchter's actions.  Why didn't he think about what was being asked of him?  Why didn't he see this inquiry in the larger scale of the history of the Second World War, and indeed in the history of civilization?  Since he was so deliberate and so thoughtful in his research in to execution equipment, why did he not research the subject of the gas chambers at Auschwitz more thoroughly?  Journalist Van Pelt explains that all he had to do was examine the archives at the camp to discover a wealth of information that the Nazis put together about the subject of the gassing basements.  Leuchter obviously understood nothing about the subject of chemistry (an absolutely necessary discipline to begin addressing the presence of cyanide on the bricks of the camp), and yet he took the job of disproving the existence of gas chambers.  Why?This is the area where Errol Morris' skill as a documentarian really shines.  He shows Fred lurching around at various white supremacist meetings to discuss the findings of his report, apparently unaware of agenda he was sent to justify.  As a thoughtful and deliberate man, he came to the conclusion that the chambers at Auschwitz could not have been used as execution chambers, but obviously uses his own narrow view point to reach that conclusion, since (in his opinion) if he had designed such a device for mass execution he would not have built it that way.  He doesn't understand that he was pushed to present a certain result, and that the individuals that wanted justification for their viewpoints were not to be trusted.  Morris lets us see all the swirling action around Leuchter, and demonstrates that Leuchter himself was unable or unwilling to see his place in the madness surrounding the trial, as well as demonstrating that Fred couldn't fully understand why state governments were suddenly unwilling to deal with him, killing his business as an execution engineer.Leuchter's detractors took pains to ruin his life which, in a country that thrives on free speech and the open expression of ideas, is as shameful an act as Leuchter's own foolish holocaust denial.  But an interviewee stated eloquently in the film that Fred had the chance to retract his statements.  Fred at any time could have limited his involvement with the project.  He should have conducted his investigation in the full light of day rather than slinking around a vitally important historical site, chopping up pieces of what many consider a holy shine to the lives of those callously murdered there.  He could have done many things that any rational and considerate person should have done.But he didn't.Morris' film is one of the best examinations of a person's life committed to film.  Highly recommended.

Leuchter, the innovator of many death penalty devices and subsequently the only scientist willing to testify favorably in a celebrated Canadian trial that questioned the existence of the Holocaust, is either a hero to some or a villain to many.  Morris, except for a Frankenstein-inspired opening and closing set in the film, prefers to let Leuchter be Leuchter rather than adding more contempt to a decidedly pitiful figure.  The one time Morris does appear to interfere is when he asked Leuchter point blank if he could have been mistaken in any of his analysis.  There are also camera tricks which render what Leuchter did as malicious, such as the split screen between what was Auschwitz and now, the slow-motion as Leuchter is chipping away at sites many Jews consider holy ground, and the phasing in and out of color and black and white film as we see Leuchter demonstrate his electric chair.  The motivation behind what he did lies at the heart of Mr. Death.  He aspired to perfect the most humane killing machine because he said he believed in capital punishment, not capital torture.  He cared that prison guards who knew the death-row inmates well would not have to suffer cleaning up the morbid residuals of those electrocuted.  Yet he tried to carry this same mind-set in understanding the gas chambers at Auschwitz.  In his mechanical mind, he asked how he could have done a better job of extermination.  Mr. Death is an unpleasant but needed lesson about the mosaic people who live and work with each of us everyday - a people who seem anti-social yet amoral and who seem to be guided by that inner light that we can barely know or understand.

In this vivid documentary, Morris lets Leuchter speak for himself (which reveals him to be a man of limited horizons with a - let's say - quirky moral code, likely undone by hubris rather than evil although Morris may deliberately be making that as far as possible an eye-of-the-beholder issue), while providing a blizzard of visual accompaniments that emphasize the lurid raw material of Leuchter's life (a strategy indicated by the B-movie undertone of the title), and flirt with his obvious sense of his own heroism. Leuchter has more than enough rope here to hang himself, and pretty much gets the job done. Morris doesn't try to explore the issue of Holocaust revisionism generally, pretty much taking our revulsion on faith if anything, from my limited previous reading on the subject, that's doing Leuchter a favor. Anyway, revulsion or not, it's hard not to be fascinated by a man who can calmly chatter about his value-pricing approach to selling death machines (although custom made, he tells us, they're sold at off the shelf prices).

DEATH THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A. LEUCHTER, JR on the final day of the 1999 Toronto Film Festival, and am happy to report that it's easily his best documentary to-date -- one that I'm certainly glad that a filmmaker of his talents was available and inclined to make.While he's never come close to making a bad (or even mediocre) documentary, Morris' more recent efforts seem to have lacked the knockout punch effectiveness of his most widely known and highly-regarded classic, THE THIN BLUE LINE, which was instrumental in getting an innocent man removed from death row.  This is the follow-up that his admirers have been waiting for... the story of a controversial man who easily blows away the combined weirdness of the quartet from Morris' last major effort, FAST, CHEAP AND OUT OF CONTROL.In the first part of the documentary, Fred Leuchter comes across as the embodiment of compassionate conservative ... a guy who firmly believes in the death penalty, but thinks that capital punishment should be more humanely administered.  He's a regular geek of death technology ... the son of a prison guard who in the 80's designed a new state-of-the-art electric chair for Missouri.  This lead to contracts with other state governments ... even ones employing execution methods (lethal injection, gas) that he had no immediate knowledge of.  There's an undeniable morbid fascination in listening to him discuss the minutiae of death technology, covering topics such as the need for a drip pan under an electric chair.  The guy is THOROUGH.But he's also vain in believing in his own infallibility as the leading authority in his field, and this proves to be his undoing.  In 1988, he accepts a job from notorious Canadian Nazi historical revisionist Ernst Zundel to perform forensic investigations as to whether or not gassings could actually have taken place at Auschwitz.  This he undertakes in earnestness, collecting all kinds of samples surreptitiously around the remains of the infamous facility while being videotaped by his guide. (Amusing side note He had just been married at the time, and this excursion was his honeymoon.)When he publishes The Leuchter Report, which concludes that gassings COULDN'T have taken place at the facility since he found no traces of cyanide in the samples, he immediately gains notoriety.  He testifies at the hate crime trial of Zundel and becomes a star speaker on the neo-Nazi circuit.  His report becomes the scientific basis for denying that the Holocaust ever happened and is widely circulated (it's easy to find via a Web search).  He clearly relishes being revered as a scientific authority -- no matter WHAT the audience.  But his business contracts disappear as a result of this notoriety, his wife divorces him, and he's left pretty destitute.In challenging Leuchter's findings, Morris wisely eschews any testimony from Holocaust survivors.  Instead, he relies on some very gentile-looking academics who meticulously show the overwhelming archival evidence (schematic diagrams of the technology, correspondence between military officers, etc.) of mass extermination at the camp and demonstrate some HUGE holes in Leuchter's scientific methodology.  When Zundel tries to refute these counterpoints by actually likening Leuchter to Christ, the jig's REALLY up.What starts out seeming like another interesting installment of FAST, CHEAP AND OUT OF CONTROL turns out to have a much larger mission  Showing the world the EXACT foundation that the scientific evidence denying the Holocaust rests upon.  It's a masterful tour-de-force from Morris, with his polished documentary techniques on full display.  It's VERY satisfying when Mr. Death turns out to be no match for a documentary filmmaker who knows how to give him enough rope to hang himself with.Even if you don't see documentaries as a rule, this one's a not-to-miss. Truth IS stranger than fiction.

Leuchter, Jr., the subject of this documentary, is a lonely man, and so a man of narrow acumen, because he's just appreciative to be liked, even by Nazi sympathizers. Errol Morris conjoins montages and music into a movie that is more reflection than subjective report. Fred Leuchter, the son of a prison warden, relatively floundered into the Death Row business. An engineer by training, he was inspired by the urge for more competent and compassionate execution apparatuses. He'd seen electric chairs that fried their sufferers without killing them, poison gas chambers that endangered the witnesses, gallows not efficiently constructed to break the neck. He went to work fashioning better versions of these devices, and soon prisons throughout the US were taking his council.Notwithstanding his advance in trade, he was not, we understand, particularly well-received socially, though he does come to marry a waitress he meets owing to his habit of more than forty cups of coffee a day. We hear her offscreen voice as she balks at Fred's belief that their trip to Auschwitz was their honeymoon, where she had to wait in a freezing car, looking out for guards. Leuchter's visit to Auschwitz was the crossroads in his work. He was asked by a neo-Nazi Holocaust denier to provide a professional opinion at his trial. Zundel financed Leuchter's 1988 trip, where he chiseled off chunks of brick and mortar in buildings used as gas chambers and had them examined for leftover cyanide. He resolves that the chambers never had capacity for gas.There is a fault in his report, needless to say. The lab technician who analyzed the samples for him protests that cyanide would sink into bricks but to the measure of one-tenth of a hair. By chiseling large bits, Leuchter had eroded his sampling by several thousand times, not even taking into account the ravages of half a century. To find cyanide would have been supernatural. No bother. Leuchter became a darling after-dinner mouthpiece in the neo-Nazi circle, and the camera captures how his face illuminates and his whole body appears to embrace their cheers and ovations, how thrilled he is to shake hands with his new friends. Other people might recoil from the derelict position of a Holocaust denier, to say the least. An executioner is a derelict anyway and finds his friends where he can.No filmmaker can be accountable for those reluctant or unfit to take in his or her film with a discerning view. Anyone who leaves this deeply unsettling film concurring with Leuchter lays claim with him on the verge of psychosis. What's unsettling about the film is the way Leuchter is fairly honorable up till the point at which the neo-Nazis sink their talons into him. Those who are revolted by ethnic cleansing and other forms of government-sponsored genocide sometimes have no pangs when the state executes them one by one, testing them on elephants as is appallingly shown early in this film through dog-eared stock footage. One can even be a two-term president after governing the most restless American Death Row on record.In cinema, the Holocaust intensifies melodrama in that the conquest of the soul never struck so victorious against atrocity, because the atrocity is so confounding. Morris's haunting documentary tries to do something distinct. It's to attempt to penetrate the thought process of denial. You meditate on the general concept of denial, not as some postwar sensation but as something that was intrinsic in the undertaking itself. Those people did those things. The mystery is how. It's about deciphering why Fred Leuchter holds these beliefs.There is paradox in of so many U.S. states heaping tax money on this guy's work, just to oust him because of his distasteful affiliations. The capability of so many people to live contentedly with the notion of capital punishment may be a hint to how so many Europeans could live with the Holocaust When you swallow the idea that the state has the right to kill someone and the right to decide what is a cardinal wrongdoing, you're nearly there. Mr. Death offers no complacent position of judgment. He doesn't make it obvious for us with light ethical categorizations, because people are formidably paradoxical and can get their minds around fearsomely peculiar notions.

His delousing chamber samples registered extremely high amounts of cyanide, proving that the cyanide is in fact easily detectable, even when diluted due to the crushing of large samples.Further, the archives were misrepresented as evidence. The items claimed as evidence were normally ordered and used in all camps in the delousing chambers, even the dozens of camps in Germany which have since been proved to have never had any homicidal gas chambers at all. The homicidal gas chamber lie originally included camps in Germany and several other occupied countries, but over time as more research has been completed, claims of homicidal gas chambers have been dis-proved in nearly all camps except for the remaining few in Soviet captured Poland that Leuchter tested. See the controversy about Leuchter? With his testing, the last bit of the homicidal gas chamber lie is laid to rest. That embarrasses many people. The documents in the archive are nothing but evidence of materials for normal delousing chambers that were used in all camps to actually keep prisoners alive by treating clothing and buildings to eliminate Typhus carrying lice - the real killer in the camps. Many thousands continued to die of Typhus even after the camps were liberated. The film goes further in deceiving people by claiming that Vergasungskeller used in the archives is evidence of homicidal gas chambers, since it means gasification chamber, but this is actually what the delousing chambers were referred to. Homicidal chambers would be called Gaskammer.For those more knowledgeable about the actual lack of evidence, it's clear this film was made for one reason; to attack Fred A. Leuchter because he's a threat to the homicidal gas chamber lie being dis-proved in the last few camps. The film relies on opinionated slander from Holocaust Museum employees calling Leuchter names like, Neo-Nazi, lying through omission and distortion of evidence, clips of Hitler mixed in to stir emotion, and even weird camera angles, dark lighting, and odd music all in an attempt to attack Mr. Leuchter.One positive about the film is that it probably backfires on some, stirring their interest to do actual research into the subject. However, because the film is clearly designed to protect a lie and slander someone, I cannot give it more than one star. Lies and slander about such an important subject are unacceptable.If you want to see a good film watch David Cole's actual tour and interview of the curator of the main Auschwitz camp. The curator admits there were no homicidal gas chambers found after the war. Obviously, the Soviets created them out of regular buildings in order to fabricate evidence to match the war propaganda they had spread. David Cole is a Jew by the way, and his film is called David Cole Interviews Dr. Franciszek Piper.We've all been told a tremendous lie. There never were any homicidal gas chambers.

Though he was not a licensed technician, he sold blueprints and homemade machines to state penitentiaries as well as acted as a consultant on the lethal machines in prisons across the country. Where Mr. Leuchter went awry was when he was contacted to investigate the truthfulness to the claim that Nazis used lethal gas to exterminate thousands of people at concentration camps in Germany and Poland. His research found him knee deep in the ruins of Auschwitz, taking rock samples off the walls of gas chamber rooms to take back to the United States for arsenic analysis. His research turned up no traces of cyanide in the wall samples nor evidence of the structural integrity of the supposed gas chambers to safely contain the gases. He presented his findings to the trial of Ernst Zundel, a holocaust denier on trial in Canada for publishing documents refuting the Holocaust ever occurred, and was successively outcast from society as a fellow Holocaust denier. Through Morris' ninety minute film, we are shown the relative success of a man quickly sink to the bottom of the world's hating order through the publication of one research project. Mr. Leuchter is portrayed as objectively as possible in this film, sometimes even going to black while his voice continues, but the sheer tenacity of this man makes me grit my teeth with rage when I think of him. His lack of concern for human life and the sufferings of others and his ambivalence towards people as both models of death and financial gain is a horrifying example of what kinds of people do what kinds of things in this world.

The fact of the matter is that Fred Leuchter has absolutely no idea what he's talking about, the way in which he gathered evidence and conducted his investigation was fundimentally flawed.

When it is allowing him to talk about his trade the film is interesting mainly because Leuchter's opinion of his work and, more importantly, himself is engaging to listen to. His attitude towards his work marks him out as somewhat of an eccentric but yet he sees himself as an expert in his craft &#150; which it is also strangely clear that he is not. However the film loses this appeal somewhat in the second half where it becomes more about Leuchter's report on the Holocaust more than it does about the man himself. In a way it does feel like Morris has lost the essence of his approach by making sure that Leuchter's words are not allowed to just stand unquestioned.Of course nobody could fault this approach because it was important not to just give this man a stage to speak unchallenged but it does rather change the film. Of course this is not to say that it isn't interesting because it still is. Pardon the pun but Morris does give Leuchter enough rope to hang himself and produces some telling moments such as him proclaiming himself the only expert in the world. The various spokespeople for the Jewish community don't really counter Leuchter and do themselves an injustice by being quite emotional in the face of his arguments. Fortunately there is enough actual factual response to him to make up for this.Overall then a quite fascinating film but not quite what I expected from Morris.

More than a political film, this is a razor- sharp case study of a bizarre personality totally out of touch with reality, a walking nut-case whose warped logic is readily accepted by those who want to believe what they want to believe. Frightening, moreover, in how it shows the thinness of the line between credibility and incredibility when it comes to the structuring of public opinion.Many Jews have attacked this film claiming that it makes too strong a case for denial, when in fact the subtle but clear intention of the filmmaker is to point up the twisted logic of the denier. To accomplish this you have to let the subject have his say, but the logic of the insane can sometimes sound uncomfortably compelling &#x96; and there's the rub. Director Errol Morris was also the maker of the extraordinary 1991 documentary on Cambridge cosmologist Stephen Hawking entitled A Brief History of Time. Dr. Death should be required viewing in Yeshivas and Churches alike.

This is a guy who became one of the US's foremost experts on death engineering - he designed and built/rebuilt several execution devices for death rows throughout the nation. Then, tragically, he took it upon himself to travel to Auschwitz and hammer bits off the gas chambers to bring home for cyanide testing. His conclusion no-one was gassed there. Oops. Then he compounded his mistake by testifying for Ernst Zundel and speaking at holocaust-revisionist meets throughout the world.So, an excellent subject for a movie, and Morris does an okay job. There are a few faults. The quality of some of the interview footage is quite poor. And there is the question of the reconstructions. Leuchter provided Morris with plenty of home movies which are incorporated into the film, so the function of the reconstructions seems merely to be to reinforce in our minds the dramatic qualities of a lot of the actions Leuchter performed. Personally, I could've done without them.10/10 for the subject, 6/10 for the film-making, gives 8/10 overall.

Throughout the first part of this movie, Leuchter talks about his improvements upon various execution devices, and not with a little pride.  He *says* he designs these things because the older devices are inhumane, that the electric chairs, for example, cook people, torture them, and that he wants to make executions as painless and quick as possible...and, you know, I believe him.  He comes off as weird, but sincere.His underground notoriety as an execution expert motivates holocaust revisionist historian Ernst Zündel to hire him to prove to a judge and jury that Nazis did not, in fact, exterminate Jews.  So Leuchter goes to Auschwitz and--illegally--gathers samples from the alleged gas chambers, crematoriums, and so on.  He smuggles these samples back to Canada, and a lab determines that they contain no traces of cyanide gas.  Based on this--and this alone, apparently--Leuchter (an engineer, but by no means a research scientist) concludes that the gas chambers were never used to gas inmates, and that the holocaust did not happen.Leuchter's evidence is easily refuted.  It isn't the filmmaker's purpose to prove him wrong, and the refutation is quickly and easily accomplished without belaboring it.  What is perhaps most interesting about this film is the manner in which it portrays Leuchter  He comes off as something of a stooge, a naive and terribly misguided participant in perhaps the most politically incorrect of all historical revisionism.  As a result of this, he is mercilessly persecuted by people who will not tolerate the existence--let alone promulgation--of opposing points of view. Disagreement is decried as hate, and in our current social environment, once you have successfully identified someone as a hatemonger, it's open season on him, In this sense, the film becomes a critical examination of a freedom we Americans claim to hold dear  the freedom of expression.  It is a freedom that comes with a price, and that is that unpopular, often wacky, ideas will be promulgated by people we may not like.  The fact is, though, that Leuchter is not an anti-semite.  Morris does not show a man with an ounce of hatred in him, or malice, and so far as we can tell, there is no ideology behind Leuchter's belief that the holocaust did not occur. That Morris manages to show Leuchter in a reasonably sympathetic light forces us to examine the alactrity with which we so often attack and attempt to destroy the speaker of unpopular ideas, when perhaps all we really ought to do is attack the ideas that are being spoken.  What makes us uncomfortable as viewers, I think, is that we feel sympathy for this guy.  Clearly, he is the victim, more than the persecutor.

Leuchter.  In so doing, he shows us what happens when the impertinent ideologue meets the power of political zealotry.  The perception of Leuchter takes on many forms.  On one hand, he is the very personification of the American dream by being a man who rose above his limited education and made a niche for himself in the business of execution.  He is also the classic American idealist.  A man who values the principles of the Constitution above all, even when defending them come at the expense of reputation and financial security. However, Leuchter is also termed an anti-Semitic death monger, and the very personification of immorality.  Turgescence aside, in my view Leuchter falls somewhere in the middle.  Leuchter's take on the Constitutional tenants of cruel and unusual punishment are clear.  He believes the state has the right to execute, yet not to torture the executed.  A modern day Joseph Ignace Guillotin, Leuchter saw his role as providing a humane death for the condemned.  By his own admission, Leuchter explained that his reputation as an expert on the varieties of killing machines, was formed in the absence of competition. Thus, Leuchter defined competency as being willing to do the research and solve the problem.  This particular expression of his Constitutional piety found him opposed only by the anti-capital punishment lobby, a frame of reference that would prove inadequate once he agreed to help Ernst Zündel.It is here that Morris and the film break down. While Morris competently sets the stage of how Leuchter could be become involved in the Zündel defense, what isn't clarified is Leuchter's take on his own methodology and the subsequent analysis done by the lab to which the rock samples were sent to.  All the testimonials that deify and demonize him are the predicable protestations of political zealots. However, the moral linchpin of the entire Fred A. Leuchter story is the degree to which Leuchter felt he lived up to his stated definition of competence, and his behavior following the socio-political uproar.  Instead, Morris leaves us with a multitude of hyperbolical expressions that provide little depth to the issue.  Morris's cinematic quirks of angled shots, changeable film stocks, and Tesla coil effects are not enough to mask this ultimate failure.  In all, an interesting yet unsatisfying effort at bringing a more comprehensive view to the story of Mr. Death.

It is absence that lends the film its irony, that enriches and empowers its flat black humor, the most sinister of jokes.As, at first, we learn of Mr Leuchter's career in engineering and constructing execution devices (gallows, electric chairs, and lethal injection machines) for US prisons, it becomes readily apparent that this little man is missing something. This most drab, humorless, and ordinary of men discusses the details of death, handles the paraphernalia of execution, without the slightest qualm, without the merest sense of awe or tragedy. His is the most literal and deadpan of worlds, utterly devoid of emotion or imagination, which, of course, not only allows him to function perfectly with the utmost clinical detachment and the best of logic, with the precision and efficiency of a machine, but also helps him do his job better than it has ever been done before. He alone is able to detect and replace all the heretofore defective death machines in the nation's prisons, claiming, thereby, to lessen human suffering! However gruesome, his quest is noble, his motives pure. He is ultra -normal, ultra -well-adjusted. And isn't just that the problem?Like widening circles on a pond, this film widens dramatically to include maybe the most perplexing moral mystery in history, the holocaust. This movie isn't just about Fred A. Leuchter, by any means. If it were, it would hardly be worth the effort to see. The film probes the question--one is made to wonder--was it his fault? Wasn't he just some dumb schmuck who played into the hands of holocaust deniers, of extremists like the Aryan Nations, who published and widely circulated his report? Wasn't he just a pawn? He certainly paid the price, complete osctracization from legitimate society he lost career and wife, and ended penniless and hounded by legal authorities. Where did he go wrong?It isn't for lack of reason or intellect that Mr Leuchter stumbles into disaster; he is the most reasonable of men, capable of fine gradations of abstraction and logic. He knows just how much current is necessary to effectively kill a man without overcooking him so that his flesh falls off his bones like an overdone chicken, his head catches on fire, or his eyes pop out and going flying across a room (all of which have been known to happen). It is for lack of a moral compass, for a lack of common humanity, the simplest, most fundamental sense of outrage and justice. That is his downfall. What is absent in him makes evil possible. And haven't we seen our share of evil over the past century?This isn't the black and white morality of the 11 o'clock news or of the million and one TV, film, or paperback crime dramas. It is the illusory and changeable face of reality, the deceptive play of appearances, the evasive, slippery nature of truth. The straight-faced, utterly flat, but blackest humor here reminded me of the same in The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil, which also deals with how modern detachment and abstraction leads to amoral chaos and loss of identity, to absurdity, impotence, and futility.But are we so much better than poor Mr Leuchter? Didn't the German people, as a whole, go wrong in exactly the same way as little Mr Leuchter, by condoning monstrous atrocities in their backyards? Aren't we, as Americans, going wrong in exactly the same way as him by condoning the death penalty in our own backyards? These are the connections implied, but never made explicit by this film. These are the corners and joints that don't quite fit, the ill-fitting loose ends that make you come back to the film long after you have seen it. It quietly, without fanfare or much ado, plants its explosive little seeds in your mind, and in this it is unique. Mr Morris, that most patient and circumspect of observers of human nature, has outdone himself with this, a most uniquely wry and insightful work. He has run his hands over, ever so lightly, so gently, found out the heart of, that most elusive of entities man's moral core. Five stars!Quibbles Mr Leuchter should have been made to answer directly for 1) the technical inaccuracy of his testimony, namely, that the cyanide residue he searched for exists in only a 10 micron thick film on the surface of objects; and 2) his active and willing participation in extremist hate group activities. These gaps are made salient by the otherwise tightly woven, credibly factual fabric of the rest of the film.

Normally the two rarely cross paths, because people are loath to submit cherished beliefs to the light of objective analysis. This is especially the case with religicized issues like the Holocaust. Regardless of what one thinks of this issue, there is always at least two sides to every event in human history, the Holocaust is no exception.While everyone has been made aware of the Zionist version of what occurred in Nazi camps such as Auschwitz, there has always been another side to this story, that has never been allowed a fair hearing! Suppression, slander, and relentless propaganda, has relegated this alternative version of events, to relative obscurity. Enter Mr. Leuchter, his honesty and professionalism, allowed him to meticulously investigate the fundamental premise of an issue that has literally become a religion in itself! Unlike his hopelessly biased opponents, he was able to remain completely objective throughout this very trying ordeal. The result was perhaps the first completely independent assessment of the merits of the issue of homicidal gas chambers in the Holocaust. Regardless of how one feels about this, Leuchter's investigation produced conclusive scientific results, that prove the infamous homicidal gas chambers in places like Auschwitz show no traces of cyanide gas! This can only be the case, if this central claim of the Holocaust, was false to began with! This of course is not out of the question, since the Holocaust has been of immeasurable political and economic value to Zionist interests.On the other hand, Leuchter's findings are a bolt of lightning in the name of truth, over blind belief, and finally sets the record straight, after these many years of erroneous history about the Holocaust. While most true holocaust believers have no use for these disturbing facts, those who understand that the truth is always of greater value, than any political agenda or belief, will welcome these startling revelations. This of course has nothing to do with hatred of Jews, but everything to do with historical revision, and correcting erroneous views of an important period of human history. As with anyone who goes against the powerful forces of political and religious orthodoxy, Mr. Leuchter paid a high price for his honesty and steadfast expression of the right of free speech. The contrast between Leuchter and the lab scientist who chose to protect himself and his company, by conveniently attempting to sabotage the results of his own unbiased tests, could not be greater! This is after all, what most men would do when facing the wrath of such ruthless foes. Leuchter on the other hand, courageously stood his ground, as a man of honesty, and integrity, in the face of a Holocaust industry, intent on crushing those who dare to question the accepted teaching on the Holocaust. For those hopelessly biased in favor of the orthodox Holocaust narrative, this film will be of little value. For those who remain of open mind, and able to appreciate the considerable loss of freedom in the west, to powerful special interests and pressure groups, this film provides a sobering look at the lengths the high and mighty will go, to destroy the lives of honest men, as well as how the hatred of those completely blinded by their beliefs, serves as another weapon, in the fight against the truth.

You will not be spoon-fed important historical essays. I offer that prior knowledge and understanding are crucial here because I find that through the exploration of its eponymous star, the director shrewdly deals less with investigation of historical accuracy and with the What, but rather with the broader scope of the How- how inhumanity happens at all? This deceivingly small and masterfully executed film very cleverly deals with the human mechanism which allows atrocities to exist in the first place.Objectivity doesn't exist, only partiality, and perhaps for that Mr. Morris waltzes around a debate regarding historical justice and accuracy and avoids falling into a familiar Holocaust narrative. No. Rather the film explores through what is perhaps the humblest tool, personified here by Mr. Leuchter, the question which is perhaps the greatest unanswered question belying at the foundations of it all- how can such inhumane atrocities possibly take place at all? As if that in itself is not a big enough issue to tackle, courageously the film goes way further and, like Mr. Leuchter himself, so offers this simple yet crucial question, here evidently still unresolved- what IS humane? The director challenges the viewer to engage in absurdities by juxtaposing questions of whether executing a man sitting comfortably under a beautiful painting is a humane act, and which is more humane- suffocating thousands in gas or rather advancing their death by starvation?The stage given to Mr. Leuchter to present his version here manifests and exemplifies lucidly the quotidian possibility of recurrence of atrocities and crimes against humanity.Must be watched at least twice.

His love of the eccentric and the condemned prove fascinating viewing, but what makes his films so utterly gripping is his objectivity. Don't get me wrong, it's more often than not very clear as to where Morris' opinions lie, but he allows his subject a fair crack, a chance to give their side of the story, no matter how outrageous it happens to be. Here, with Mr. Death, about the highs and lows of Fred Leuchter, expert manufacturer of execution devices and Holocaust denier, Morris lets his subject seal his own fate with his own words.With his father a prison warden, Fred Leuchter spent a lot of his youth around criminals, many of whom were facing imminent execution. Having heard about the flaws in the execution facilities - many of which were built by non-professionals with only a photograph to work from - Leuchter took it upon himself to design an electric chair that was not only more reliable, but more 'humane', both for the prisoner and the wardens. Soon enough, without any engineering qualifications, Leuchter was being employed by other states to design gallows and machines to administer lethal injection. Meanwhile in Canada, renowned neo-Nazi Ernst Zundel published a paper that denied the existence of the Holocaust. Leuchter was brought in as an 'expert' to investigate the gas chambers of Auschwitz, only to discover no trace of cyanide. This led to Leuchter's paper The Leuchter Report, and the downfall of the man's life and reputation.Similar to Morris' The Fog of War (2003), which allowed former Secretary of Defence Robert S. McNamara to be viewed as a human being and not the monster it was so easy to label him as, Leuchter does not come across as an anti-Semite, or even someone that believes half the things he says. This mouse of a man - short, ugly, addicted to coffee and cigarettes - is entirely non-threatening. But as we witness him getting swept up in the neo-Nazi rallies he's invited to speak at, he comes across as a man that simply has a need to feel a purpose and place in the world. What he did is unspeakable - illegally gathering samples by chipping off stone from the walls of a place many hold sacred, to use his self-labelled expertise to deny the most shocking genocide in history - but it is nevertheless hard not to feel some sort of pity for him.Being a former detective, Morris doesn't need to try very hard to disprove Leuchter's findings, and rubbishes with them with a few swift strokes. But those of us with working brains in our heads don't need to be told the Holocaust was real, so Morris doesn't spend too much time on it. This is very much about the man behind the uproar, using archive footage of his time at Auschwitz to portray a man that doesn't seem to grasp the true gravity of the situation. Why did he do it? Can he comprehend the possible repercussions of the words that come out of his mouth? Whatever the answers, this is a fantastic documentary - gripping, shocking, informative and objective, everything you would expect from Errol Morris.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"The Hangman Has No Friends","Date":"4 April 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Biography","Review":" I've been over and over, back and forth through my vocabulary and my thesaurus, trying to find just the right qualifying word to accurately describe what Fred Leuchter Jr. does for a living. He designs implements of execution electric chairs, lethal injection machines etc. I find myself falling pathetically on the word ghoulish. The documentary 'Mr. Death' gives consideration to something I never really thought about. When a person goes to be executed by the state, where does the execution machine come from? I admit that I never imagined anyone sitting over a drafting table working out the blueprints for such a device.Yet, having heard Fred Leuchter Jr. (pronounced Look-Ter) speak about his job, I can say that if anyone must to build such a device, it might as well be him. He seems to know what he's talking about. His name is sort of legendary (I would guess so . . . is there another person who does this? When the State of New Jersey contacted him to be a consultant on the proposal of the design of a lethal injection machine, he agreed but admitted that he didn't have the first idea how to design one. The doctor's presentation to the deputy commissioner of the prison wasn't going well, until the doctor mentioned that Leuchter designed the cap for the prison's electric chair. The commissioner's eyes lit up and he was sold on the idea without another word. Most of us could only wish to have a reputation that solid.Leuchter looks a little peculiar but you wouldn't expect someone who holds such a position to look anything but out of place. He's short, with a round face, big glasses and a thick New England accent. He resembles a very dowdy cousin of Elton John. Even if you have no objection to his work, you have to admit that there is an heir about him that wouldn't make you eager to invite him to tea. He is a man, however, that you want to listen to. He has odd stories and anecdotes that either intrigue or repulse depending on your personal taste. I can only speculate that his circle of close friends is a bit small, especially when you consider that one of his bits of knowledge involves the ins and outs of how dangerous it is to be in the death chamber electrocuting someone with urine on the floor from the previous execution. With that nugget of information and his habit of drinking 40 cups of coffee a day and smoking 6 packs of cigarettes, I would imagine he isn't exactly a fun date. Based on that addiction, I wasn't too surprised to learn that he eventually married a waitress.'Mr. Death The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.' not only examines Leuchter's work, but also the turning point that cost him his job and his reputation. That came with his association with Ernst Zundel, a neo-Nazi who went on trial for public slander after he published a report stating that the holocaust was a myth. In 1988, the two traveled to Auschwitz to collect concrete samples from the remains of the gas chamber to prove that no traces of Zychlon B (the lethal gas that was used to kill Jews in the gas chambers) was present. Those samples were going to be used in Zundel's case to prove that he was right about his claims. The science was flawed and the jury was biased. What happened to Leuchter's reputation was a full-frontal assault on very the idea of free speech. His views and his mere association in the Zundel case cost him everything. He became a pariah, a lamb to the slaughter just for speaking his newly acquired views against the holocaust. Whether he meant it or was just saying it to impress some new friends hardly matters. The fact that he said them was damning enough.'Mr. Death The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.' comes from one of the most creative minds to ever to work in the arena of documentaries. Erroll Morris never plays it safe. His films are never about ordinary people doing ordinary things. He loves the circus freaks among us, people who do and are obsessed with odd things. He made 'Gates of Heaven', about the owners of a pet cemetery in Southern California; 'Vernon, Florida' about various weirdos in the title town including a man who lives, breaths, eats and sleeps and dreams turkey hunting; 'The Thin Blue Line' a film about a murder in a small town that was so persuasive that it sparked a reopening of the case; 'A Brief History of Time' about the life and theories of Stephen Hawking who discusses his understanding of the vastness of the universe while suffering from a condition that renders him almost completely unable to move.Here again, Morris chooses someone out of the ordinary. Fred Leuchter Jr. is an odd little man with a ghoulish job, who takes up with the wrong side of the holocaust and doesn't resend it in order to save his reputation. Why? What happens to Leuchter's reputation once he takes the side of the Neo-Nazis is, I think, criminal. He chose the wrong friends, said the wrong things and made people believe what he was saying simply by saying it. Was he a Neo-Nazi? Who knows? Who cares? Leuchter is a product of our times, times in which verbal intolerance is put on the shelf with mass murder, when people are so outraged by the act of being offended that they commit a character assassination of a man just for publicly stating his opinion. What happened to him was a pitiful revelation that words and kill just has inhumanely as a botched electric chair.**** (of four) "},{"Title":"This documentary is great","Date":"21 October 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Biography","Review":" I'm actually doing a research for a presentation on this documentary.

Leuchter is a man whom you want to despite, to hate with all your being. It's easy to do. How could a man be so foolish and ego-maniacal? He was already fortified with a solid career as an engineer who helped manufacturer and supervise the more 'humane' developments of the electric chair, lethal injection, hanging, and gas chamber methods of capital punishment. On that point, whether or not you agree with the death penalty, he worked as a professional (or at least in his mind he did, to where he was contracted all over the country). But then came the neo-Nazi/holocaust denier from Canada who drafted Leuchter- a man who never faced defending such a man (albeit he still to this day believes any person has a fair right to a defense, and still albeit in Canada)- to go to Poland and Germany, dig up some samples off the fronts of the walls in the dilapidated concentration camps, and see if gas was to be detected. He brought back samples (undercover), gave it to a scientist, who found there were no traces of gas. Imbued by this, he wrote the 'Leuchter Report', and then everything went to hell...In Errol Morris's film of Mr. Death, Leuchter is portrayed in a very complex manner. You're not sure what to make of him going from scene to scene; he knew what he was doing was for science- he professes also to this day to not be anti-Semitic, this despite his appearances as a guest speaker with Revisionist History groups- but he wasn't the right person for the job, if the job should've even been considered in the first place. As the scientist at the Massachusets facility Leuchter (not saying what really for) brought the samples said, there wasn't enough real data to prove or disprove anything about what was in the walls. Also, Leuchter didn't do his homework on matters surrounding the camps. Any filmmaker might've just focused on this portion of Leuchter, as his most notorious moment which was his own undoing (no more career, no more wife, reduced to trying to sell half a lethal injection machine).But Morris has the first half hour of the film as an utterly fascinating dissection of the mechanics and physics of cooking a man with electricity, or the gears of making sure that injecting a man's death is by all means 'comfortable'. He's a guy who drinks, astonishingly, 40 cups of coffee, smoking 6 packs a day, and seems perfectly normal. With this prelude, we're given what seems to be another of the honorable defectives in a line of Morris films (i.e. Gates of Heaven, Vernon Florida, Fast Cheap and Out of Control). So by the time the Leuchter report story unfolds, he comes off as, in a way, more pathetic than really evil. As one of the other interviewees observes, he's not naive (hence the money he was paid and the notoriety he soaked up before the big fall in reputation), and he also believes in free speech and the right to a defense, so on and so on. He's certainly not a man one would usually want to have a cup of Joe with. But pure evil? Mr. Death is one of Morris's most peering and uncompromising documentaries, and this time his profile of this not-quite tragic figure allows for him plenty of room for contemplation- not about if the holocaust didn't happen, lord knows Morris isn't out for that, and I'm sure he would believe the jury is in, but about the dangers of pride in one's work (i.e. Leuchter wasn't Sherlock Holmes), and as well about the nature of execution itself. We're given the plethora of chilling visuals from Morris's great abstract sensibility extreme close-ups of flesh being prepared to get killed, of Leuchter preparing in one of the execution rooms, of him just walking down the side of a highway out of focus (lit wonderfully, most of the time, by Robert Richardson). And, of course, the head-on close-ups where we're getting the full scoop right between the eyes. It adds to a sense of mild-mannered terror, at least in the Leuchter bits, even when he's talking like a rational being (which is off and on).What strikes the most about Mr. Death, however, is how Leuchter justified himself by either providing some human decency, or in providing facts. Both have the tinge of delusion, more or less, and at the same time an earnestness in how he views himself in relation- clinically- with his subjects. How human, exactly, is Leuchter himself? His marriage happened almost on a lark to get away from his mother. He rarely cracks a joke. He's almost reminiscent of some side character no one thinks about in some science fiction film. And you never want to look away from him.

As a psychology teacher, these sort of films make great fodder for discussions with my students. I haven't shown them MR. DEATH, but might consider doing so in the future since the main character is so bizarre and difficult to comprehend.The film is unusual in that the first third of the film is amazingly different than the rest of the film. It seemed as if the man who was the focus of the film (Fred Leuchter) was an entirely different person in the final 2/3 of the movie. This was very clever film making--throwing the audience a curve-ball, so to speak. As a result, the audience which initially probably felt somewhat sympathetic towards this very odd man, are now transformed into charter members of the I hate Fred Club! As the film begins, you'll notice that there is no traditional voice-over narration--instead, Fred and a variety of others talk on camera as narration. It seems that Fred has become a bit of an authority on how to humanely execute criminals (an interesting oxymoron). Oddly, while he has some advanced training and is obviously very bright, he seems way overconfident in himself and his abilities. He also seemed quite ghoulish in his excitement about his trade (building and remodeling all types of death equipment), but on the other he also seems pretty decent as he talks about how its wrong to make people feel pain or make the executions too grisly. He felt his job was a positive thing in order to make the execution as easy on the recipient as possible. While this may or may not have been the purpose of the film, the overall message did a lot to make me think twice about the death penalty--especially when he talked about how messy and disgusting the process actually was. Television and movie portrayals are WAY too sanitized and hearing Fred talk about the process is very disturbing.Then, almost completely out of the blue, the film discusses Fred's involvement in a court battle in Canada concerning hate speech. A holocaust denier was going on trial for publishing booklets saying that there wasn't any widespread killing of Jews by the Nazis. Fred was hired as an expert witness to testify for the defense even though he really didn't have formal training in executions or mass exterminations (it was more a hobby or he was a semi-pro in the field). The film then follows him to Auschwitz as he illegally takes samples to prove that no gassings occurred there. While Fred seems very confident of his methodology, the film makers later reveal that in many ways he had no idea what he was talking about nor did he know how to take proper samples.The sad part about the film is not just how he was used by the neo-Nazis but how Fred was so dogmatic and narcissistic that he could not allow himself to question his methodology or objectivity. As a result, Fred's life was destroyed and at the same time, he became a celebrity, of sorts, on the neo-Nazi talk circuit. So on one hand, he's lost his job,wife and home, he's hated by practically everyone---and on the other, he's the darling of pinheads all over the world! By the end of the film, Fred is as dogmatic as ever--even as his life goes down in flames! As far as how the film was constructed, it was excellent. Fortunately for the film maker (Errol Morris), there was film of a young Fred cavorting about prisons with his father (who worked there) and when sampling the death camp for evidence of cyanide, there was also a film crew of his own documenting the process. Morris was able to integrate these into present day video to produce an intriguing but highly confusing and disturbing film. While this film is definitely not for everyone, those who have a high tolerance for the weird and a desire to learn about odd personalities are strongly encouraged to give this one a try. Just be prepared to feel that Fred is quite the enigma and answers won't be very easy to find. Also be prepared to both hate the man and yet feel a tad sorry for him at the same time--a truly odd and jarring experience for me.For more information about Fred, try the following link (http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_A._Leuchter). Unlike some Wikipedia articles, this one seems rather sound--with decent documentation. I particularly was surprised to see that Fred was not even an engineer but had a BA in history and he was definitely practicing as a trained engineer!! Even the Errol Morris documentary didn't catch that!

He seems a rather simple, unaffected character, emotionally retarded; real. While he is right that execution in many of the states is inhumane, he never questions the ethic of capital punishment.Leuchter is peculiarly meticulous, and at the same time, totally unscientific. (Who would seriously undertake an archaeological investigation of such magnitude - which is essentially what he attempts, at Auschwitz, chipping at one of Europe's great/terrible ruins - with such a slim knowledge of what he was doing!?) It is never less than fascinating.If anything, Leuchter seems to get carried away with the celebrity of being involved with Zundel. He goes, in an instant, from being a mere functionary to being a celebrity.On a side point Holocaust revisionism is not, in itself, wrong. Now, wait a minute, let me speak. Holocaust revisionism is not wrong; it is merely incorrect. Theories can be debated, but not facts. And the historical facts speak clearly of the atrocities carried out by the Nazis during the Second World War.I think that the anger that is often vented at people like Zundel (or even at those who defend their right to speech) is misplaced; whatever his motivations - be they honourable or not - the argument should be rationally conducted. Remember, the onus of proof/disproof is on them; give them enough rope and they will hang themselves.Defaulting to partisan positions - which are positions of choice - and the inability to carry out a clear-headed discussion of points of fact, is itself a form of censorship which plays into the hands of the Zundels of this world. This point is illustrated brilliantly, by Noam Chomsky, in 'Manufacturing Consent', which I would also like to recommend to people who enjoyed 'Mr. Death'.

As long as you have good continuity people to make sure the sets are dressed the same, and good actors who can remember the state of mind their character is supposed to be in, even when not filming in sequence, it doesn't make all that much difference in the interpretation of the film.I'm not sure the sequence of filming for a documentary makes all that much difference - Morris took 30 months to acquire data for THE THIN BLUE LINE and from however much footage he shot, edited down to a very intriguing film. I can't say I ever wondered about timelines in that film - the chronology seemed rather straightforward.But I must say I would be very interested to know if the chronology of interviews and events in MR. DEATH were entirely in sequence. I wonder this due to a statement made by Mr. Leuchter toward the beginning of the film. He's talking about making a sales presentation for one of his lethal injection machines at a prison. He mentions that one of the officials seems to be paying little or no attention to the presentation (he probably didn't understand most of what I was saying - to  paraphrase Leuchter) until the official discovers that Leuchter had designed the helmet for an electric chair at some other institution. At this point the official halts the proceeding and tells his subordinates to expedite the paperwork for the sale/installation of the injection machine. Although no doubt keeping his surprise to himself, Leuchter's voice-over wonders at how, just because he knows electric chairs, he should be expected to be an expert at lethal injection machines - or even gas chambers?Now, I should very much like to know the timepoint of this particular interview/event. Fred acknowledges that he is well-versed and even an expert in the field of electric chairs, but is amazed (dumbfounded, perhaps) that he would be presumed an expert in lethal injection and/or death by gas?If so, when did his opinion of himself change?Or is it rather that he considers himself an expert in *all* these areas, but is offended that someone in a position of authority doesn't really listen to his explanation of his latest injection machine but authorizes the sale based on his electric chair reputation?If the former is the explanation, it would be interesting to know at what time he began to consider himself an expert at death by hydrogen cyanide in gas chambers. Did he ever think, as a control experiment, to get samples of the structures inside gas chambers where he had worked/advised in the USA - which he no doubt would have been able to do legally?If the latter, when did he begin to fancy himself an organic chemist?It would have been interesting if the question put to Mr. Leuchter about whether he felt he had made any mistakes would have been focused onto the lack of scientific knowledge in the stone-chipping escapade. We are told toward the end of the film that Mr. Leuchter was not a licensed or registered engineer - whether that is material or not - who knows? It may mean he just didn't pay X dollars for some sheet of paper. We aren't told what *type* of engineering degree he had - but it sure wasn't chemical engineering.Maybe these questions were asked - maybe they weren't answered, or maybe they were edited out. Maybe they make for a different film than Errol Morris wanted to make. Roger Ebert has said that Morris is much more interested in the spaces between the facts than with the facts themselves. He is fascinated by strange people, by odd word choices and manners of speech, by the way that certain symbols or beliefs can become fetishes with the power to rule human lives.I liked the film - but I would have liked more facts and less spaces between them.

He seems to be ultra-prude - notice his ex-wife's mention of the fact that all the time in Poland, they didn't sleep in the same bed once. He doesn't seem to think much about things either. His opinions seem to be formed on the spot for the camera. But there's something dark inside that makes him smile like a kid at a birthday party whenever he's around a new electric chair - that same dark thing compelled him to go to Poland and scrape rock from a room where countless men, women, children, and old people died. What I got from this movie was a feel of how the holocaust could have happened - it didn't depend so much on evil as much as it did on indifference - people like Fred Leuchter Jr., who, in his own words, can sleep fine at night. This is not because he's a sadist and enjoyed designing death equipment, it's because he was able to abstract out what he was really doing, and think of it as an engineering problem. A single Hitler with a few Lackeys couldn't have killed 6 million people on his own, he needed people like Fred to do it. Indifferent people who are just doing their jobs.Problems I had with this movie that flashing in the beginning. Anyone have a seizure during that? Also, it seemed too staged - it was too easy to imagine Morris saying to Fred ok, now look at the electric chair.. play with the dials a bit... I also would have liked to have seem Leuchter meet face to face with the chemist who did the analysis of the rock. I am left wondering, is Leuchter just ignorant?

The first part of the film has the nerdy Leuchter recounting his career in garrulous fashion and propounding the pros and cons of various methods of execution (for the record, he favors the electric chair, but only if it is designed by him). Already we are firmly planted in the Errol Morris landscape of blooming eccentrics, complete with the odd quirks, such as Leuchter's daily consumption of 40 cups of coffee.  But midway through, the film has a shocking surprise in store for us. It turns out that Leuchter had been hired as an expert witness by a Canadian Holocaust denyer who was on trial for spreading hate propaganda.  Leuchter travels to Auschwitz intent on proving that no gassings could have occurred there.  He returns with flimsy evidence to that effect, and although his infamous report is never admitted in the trial, Leuchter finds himself a hero of Holocaust revisionists and a hot ticket on the Neo-Nazi talk circuit.  Morris does little more than point the camera at Leuchter and let him talk -- giving him enough rope to hang himself (a fitting metaphor in this case).  You don't know whether to laugh at this nerdy little jerk or to be horrified.  The subject is full of irony and dark fascination, but Morris's style is not as diverting as in his previous films, and he has trouble bringing it to feature length.  Merely finding an eccentric character and pointing the camera at him is not enough, no matter how strange he is.  What is missing are the typical Morris cinematic flourishes that we saw in The Thin Blue Line and Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control, much better films.  There are some bits of interest, outside of Leuchter's talking head, but not enough. I liked Morris's use of old home movies, some videotape of Leuchter in Auschwitz, and offscreen interviews with Mrs. Leuchter, his wife of short duration (the trip to Auschwitz was also made to serve as their honeymoon).  The movie is worth seeing for its incredible subject matter, but it is not up to Morris's high standard of filmmaking.  The best Morris-style film of the year was not made by Morris at all -- it was S. R. Bindler's magnificent Hands on a Hard Body.

Similarly, he says he drinks 40 cups of coffee a day. Again, his java junkie habits are not apparent; Fred seems to love to cling to and exaggerate his bad-boy vices.He is surprised and shakes his head when his expertise in designing electric chairs gets him contracts on lethal injection and gas systems, yet he takes the contracts and acts the expert in fields on which he admits he knows nothing. It is in the role as gas expert that the bad boy sneaks into Auschwitz and other camps to carve large chunks of wall and floor to have tested for cyanide, which is later proved to be extremely poor science.But for Fred, it's no matter at all; the holocaust deniers have exalted him to ultimate bad boy status and saluted his so-called expertise. He won't cop to the fact that he screwed up, that his scientific method was terrible, that the German records showed that things he couldn't find at the camps had indeed been long moved and removed, that cyanide gas would have only penetrated 10 microns into surfaces that had long been worn away from exposure to wind and water, and that even if the cyanide was in the samples he had provided, that the chunks were so large so as to include so much that would not have been penetrated by cyanide as to completely dilute whatever microscopic amount into a concentration that was down to nothing.So when Leuchter sits in the electric chair, we all know that, even though he has been vilified, he has put himself there, and he enjoys the view and the status.Normally, I evaluate the film, but it's hard to disassociate Leuchter from the film itself. Errol Morris has done a terrific job chronicling the rise and fall of this little man; I don't believe he's succeeded as well since the incredible Gates of Heaven.

Rarely do the millions of other deaths at the hands of Hitler's fanatics rate even a casual remark Leuchter would have been far safer directing his efforts there instead. No doubt ol' Fred is a good mechanic and that is where he should have kept his attention. Interesting documentary but the camera work and editing was often sloppy.

I understand it was for informative purposes, but I didn't necessarily need to know who Fred Leuchter was. I'm not sure if there are people in the world who actually know who he is and that he was an idiot, but now they do. The documentary portrayed him as a dorky guy who basically didn't know what he was talking about. Why was it so important to make a documentary on the rise and fall of Fred Leuchter? Was it to show the gas chamber designers that they shouldn't make accusations about a highly sensitive event, such as the Holocaust? Look where it got him, alone. I understand that we were supposed to watch this documentary for an assignment, but couldn't a different documentary been picked? This documentary didn't make me want to go out and change the world like other documentaries did.
