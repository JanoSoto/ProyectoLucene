[{"Title":"Another lesson in movie making by Clint","Date":"23 March 2005","Score":"79 out of 101 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" A stylish and haunting film-noir thriller, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is another lesson in peerless film-making by Clint Eastwood. John Cusack makes one of his most positive performances and skips the usual charming giddiness he is famed for. The storyline never ceases to surprise you and neither do the characters. Spacey's Jim Williams is one of the most fascinating villains ever and Spacey again delivers a perfect performance. More solid work comes from Allison Eastwood, Jude Law and Lady Chablis, the humorous treat of the film.The most mystic and chilling scene is in the middle of the film, when Williams and Kelso visit Minerva, the scene which gives the movie its name. The climax is also incredibly well written and directed, one of the most suspenseful ever. A bravura work from a man who has long since learned how to make perfect film noirs. A highly enjoyable and recommendable movie.10/10 "},{"Title":"Neither The Book Nor A Bust","Date":"19 May 2005","Score":"56 out of 69 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Like Citizen Kane and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Midnight At The Garden Of Good And Evil is a movie about a writer trying to get a simple story, and finding himself with more than he bargained for. John Cusack is the writer, John Kelso, and his explorations of Savannah, Georgia offer some mystery and fun, though the result will be flat for those who already know the story from reading the best-selling book.Better to be on the edge of a party, don't you think? a young woman named Mandy (Alison Eastwood) asks Kelso at one point. It's a pertinent question. Alison's father Clint and screenwriter John Lee Hancock try to accomplish much the same effect here, dancing at the perimeters of things, showing conversations where words can not be discerned. Many times we see Kelso looking in on some social function from the outside, like at a cotillion for black debutantes or bridge games at the Married Women's Club, a bit adrift but interested in the games people play.At the same time, Kelso becomes quite close to one Savannah resident, Joe Williams, an art dealer whose homosexuality is an open secret until he comes out of the closet by shooting his boy-toy. Kevin Spacey's performance as Williams is rich and fun, his accent not note-perfect but well-tailored to his polished delivery. The way he lazily smokes his cigars as he moves through a party, dabbles in lowcountry voodoo with Jesuitical zeal, or even eats gumbo in prison is a study in an actor's sense of the wholeness of the role.While many book fans savage this with the comment It's not what I read in the book, I take it in stride. John Berendt didn't carry this thing down from Mt. Sinai either &#x96; most notably by presenting the killing as something that happens after his arrival rather than before he played with the facts in the book. So when the film gives us a romance between Berendt's stand-in Kelso and Mandy or invents connections between the Williams story and the others in the book so the secondary characters can appear in the main story, it kind of works in an offbeat way.What doesn't work is the pace. The film goes on for over two and a half hours, and feels longer. Eastwood obviously approached this project with enthusiasm for the book, and especially for the music of Johnny Mercer which is prominently featured. But the comedy feels labored, the depiction of Williams' trial too unshaded in its sympathy for the defendant, and many of the performances, like that of Jude Law as the dead loverboy, seem underbaked.Two good performances are delivered by people who had real-life roles in the book. Sonny Seiler, who defended Williams, plays the judge in the trial and gets to tell himself when he's out of order. The Lady Chablis, who I never cared for much in the book, has an engaging vulnerability on screen. Even when the story screeches off track by focusing on her character, she makes the logic gaps less bothersome with her playfulness.I even liked Alison Eastwood, who does a good accent, looks the part of Mandy, and makes the film's most egregious detour from the book seem less of a violation. Not a stunner, but her languid delivery and drooping eyelids are very sensual in the everyday manner she presents us with, a half-promise of something good reaching out to you in the dark. In that way, she recreates the spirit of the book quite wonderfully. Pity her father didn't always do the same, but this is an entertaining film more often than not.

Two highly-acclaimed recent Eastwood films -- Mystic River and Million-Dollar Baby -- mildly disappointed me by sinking into oversimplification and predictability. Possibly Eastwood's directing hand is more interesting when less self-assured, because 1997's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil follows these questions down less well-defined, and thus less predictable, paths. Maintaining a scrupulously neutral eye, the film recounts a complex tale of murder, involving characters who are recognizable types on the surface but carry deep difference underneath. It unfurls a slow, rich, and troubling narrative which answers the mysteries of its crime premise even as it opens much more difficult questions about the very things that murder stories are supposed to make simple innocence, guilt, motivations, affection, and its characters' so-called morality.Thanks in large part to a literally mesmerizing performance by Kevin Spacey (I'm riveted every time he appears on screen) and a well- balanced turn by John Cusack as the sympathetic investigating reporter, who charms us even as he maintains a total and focused receptivity to new information and strange events, the movie fills its two and a half hours with a slow-paced and carefully balanced story that brings us into the suffocating green world of Southern Gothic, with its all its mannered refinements, thick silences and passionate secrets. There's something in this film that would have pleased Tennessee Williams or Truman Capote, those cool-eyed investigators of the closeted South. John Berendt's nuanced book, Spacey's restrained, smoldering performance and Eastwood's lucidly hands-off direction have created a strange, slow gem of a film. It's not a gem appreciated by everyone, but two years before Spacey's turn in American Beauty struck a chord that resonated with the wider public, Midnight in the Garden asks similar questions in a context that is, at the same time, more precise, more exotic, and equally American.

I especially enjoyed watching Lady Chablis and Jim Kelso's relationship mature and change throughout the film.  I have seen the movie numerous times and plan to see it again.

Think of it as an art-house film.","Date":"24 October 2000","Score":"36 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  I haven't read the book. Might have hated the film if I had. But I liked it. I did read some reviews before viewing the film, and I was prepared to dislike it. A lot of the criticism has some validity. The movie isn't really a linear type of murder mystery. It's partly that and partly a quirky travelogue of Savannah. The Lady Chablis character gets way too much screen time, apparently because Eastwood thinks that it will entertain us. It does, but only to a point. However, this is a different sort of movie, so I understand why Eastwood includes so much of Chablis, and the voodoo woman, and the fly guy. Also, John Cusack plays it with the same dead-fish expressionlessness that he brings to most of his roles. This isn't really bad, it's just that he's always the same. I had never seen one of Kevin Spacey's films before, and I am impressed at how he really nailed the role. I thought his performance made this film.A word or two about the accents. Most non-Southern actors really murder Southern accents. I'm from Texas, not the Georgia coast, but I thought Spacey hit the accent just right all the way through. It was always there, but was never the focus. (Streepian in its apparent effortlessness) Jack Thompson did his accent very well, also, particularly since I understand that he's an Aussie. Some other cast members didn't do well with the Southern accent, like Alison Eastwood. She overdid it. It seemed strained. And oh, yeah, Cusack sounds like an accentless Californian rather than a New Yorker. Overall, I guess I've written a lot more criticism than praise, but that wasn't my intent. This was a good movie. Think of it more as an art-house film rather than a mass-market picture, and you might have more realistic expectations.

Some see weeds and disarray - a classic hothouse garden gone to seed - yet others perceive an Autumnal garden garish in its primary colours of Fall yet splendid in its descent into decay. A splash of brilliance before the inevitable passage into death of all living things.Luckily, I read Berendt's book before seeing the film, and realise just how hard Hancock must have worked to translate it to the screen. It is also, in my mind, one of Eastwood's best (if not THE best) directorial outings. The casting is superb. Not a 'clunker' among them. As an evocation of the decline of the contemporary South, I would offer that it is nonpareil lazy, sleazy, desperate at times, yet possessed of a dignity that is long past in the rest-of-the-world. Whilst Savannah is not the Big Easy, as portrayed it has much of its charm, artifice, and implied danger. And there's the rub when becoming engrossed in this garden of smoke and mirrors. It appeals to those of us who can only be outsiders looking in. The inclusion in the screenplay of Kelsoe's love interest (not present in the book) was, for me, an acceptable complication. It juxtaposed the Yankee's at times ingenuous fascination with all around him. His apparent ambivalence toward the sexuality aimed at him by the central characters (Jim and the Lady Chablis are obviously enamoured of him) becomes anchored in his desire to be part of their world but on his terms. Thus the inclusion of a heterosexual relationship which leads to his decision to stay.I would offer, however, that one of the most telling scenes (at least in exploration of Kelsoe's character) is his obvious pride in the 'overpaint' - given to him by Jim - hanging on his newly-acquired wall as he tells his 'love-interest' that he is 'here to stay' for at least six months as he writes his book. It is not the presented landscape itself which intrigues us it is the possibility that something more valuable resides beneath. A mystery left unsolved. Just like Savannah, really. An excellent film. Enjoy it for itself.

There is of course no reason to expect a  movie to be an exact replica of a book, but when it is such an excellent book it is a pity that Eastwood chose to alter things unnecessarily.  Too much of his daughter (charming though she may be), too much Lady Chablis (fascinating ditto). These additions took up time and space where the actual story could have been fleshed out more.In spite of these minor quibbles, I still think it is an interesting story - and to fans of the book I say - accept it for what it is - it is a fascinating film, entertaining and well worth watching.

But here Midnight In The Garden Of Good and Evil is astounding entertainment and it features actor Kevin Spacey in one of his most gifted role of his career. The movie focuses on the happenings of Savannah,Georgia where the city of hot nights and cold-blooded murder all rolled into one. Its a rarely do movies of this magnitude show so much of true southern city they are depicting and basically get it right. It also shows in the first half of the movie the that way these houses and the designs which are depicted is incredible(yes,Mr. Eastwood has a eye for good art)and they way details are properly set,especially with the Christmas party dinner scene is perfect as well as the overall architecture of some of the most lavish houses ever bulit(if you ever go down to Savannah you must see this to believe it and its worth the trip) as well as the proper way to show courtesy of upright manners in front of your guests where hospitality is always first rate. But as far as the movie is concern(which is based on John Berendt's novel of the same title)what you see is depicted throughout the movie and the overall beauty of the city of Savannah. The people are so loving and caring that it makes you not only leave,but stay here more to see what happens next. I got the chance to read the book on this,but I take the book over the movie as a tossup,but you will not be disappointed. A grand style of entertainment at its finest hour. Thank you so much Kevin Spacey and director Clint Eastwood.

HOW BAD COULD IT BE??I was wrong.Regardless of whether you're a fan of the book or a 'newcomer', this movie is sure to disappoint. The novel, which consists of a number of hilarious character sketches followed by a short mystery, has been mangled into a remarkably mundane mystery plot. The screenwriter also threw in a romantic subplot, presumably because the filmgoing public demands it (or perhaps because the director's daughter needed a role?). Finally, Savannah's grace, charm, and quirkiness--conveyed so well in the book--has completely eluded the moviemakers.Oh, and the movie is 2 hours too long.The only saving grace of this movie is watching the charismatic Lady Chablis, played by herself.

The plot has been streamlined (one trial instead of four), some of the characters given expanded roles, others dropped out, a fictitious affair inserted. However the essentially journalistic narrative remains, and the theme remains &#150; outsider tries to understand an inward-looking society bent on preserving their environment and way of life and resisting outside influence. Healthy decadence, if there is such a thing.The Jim Williams case is really just a framework for author Berendt's enquiry into what makes Savannah tick, and the film tends to ignore that, concentrating on the trial(s) and Jim's relationship with the author figure, who is given a much bigger role than in the book. Hence some of the color bits, Minerva the voodoo lady, Joe the feckless party giver, even the Lady Chablis (played by herself) seemed kind of irrelevant.Some nice acting was evident. Kevin Spacey as Jim Williams in a silver waistcoat and bushy moustache looked a bit like a riverboat gambler, but he held our attention, if not our sympathy. Jack Thompson as his lawyer showed his courtroom manner has come a long way since 'Breaker Morant' and almost had me convinced he really was a good ole boy from the American South instead of a Melbourne bred actor. The bulldog was good too. Savannah is truly a cute town and deserves a visit; the film does not really do it justice. It's done the tourist industry there some good though. On a recent visit your correspondent was unable to get into Clary's, a fairly ordinary diner made famous by the book and the film, for lunch (they don't do dinner) due to the busloads of tourists that had descended on it. Never mind, there's better food elsewhere - try the deli on Drayton &#150; Parker's, I think.

His character is alleged to be from New York, but talks nothing like a New Yorker, and worse, is bemused by everything. (This does make it convenient for Cusack, who thus has to wear only one facial expression for most of the movie.) He is first bemused by a man walking an invisible dog -- when in the streets of his character's alleged hometown, people hold conversations with entire invisible people daily -- by the guy in the diner (pretty fly for a white guy), and then by the concept that a zillionaire, especially in the South, would keep loaded weapons in the house. Then, he completely misses the Lady's reference to her hormone shots, and thus gets to be bemused by her revelation, with which his line, She's a he?, bludgeons us over the head. I have been to New York, and I can tell you that no true New Yorker would be even MILDLY startled that somebody born into a male-sexed body can make an attractive and convincing female. (Technical note Chablis isn't pre-op, she's non-op. The book makes it quite clear that although her sex and gender don't match, she has no desire to undergo expensive, risky, and painful sex reassignment surgery.) When Cusack discovers his book in Spacey's library, you're not so much surprised that Spacey owns the book as you are surprised that Cusack's halfwit character could write an entire book all by himself.So, let's see. What stereotypes and clichés do we have, in just the first hour?1. Southerners, when not merely eccentric, are outright freakish. (However, unlike Boo Radley or Karl Childers from Sling Blade, the guy who commits the murder can at least keep up a veneer of non-freakdom.)2. Fat black women, when not feeding hordes of white people, are practicing voodoo. 3. All trans gendered women are entertainers, and have potty mouths. (Sorry, Chablis. This one is at least in part your fault.) 4. Anybody from north of the Mason-Dixon Line is going to be completely stunned to discover that Southerners can be eccentric and freakish; apparently they've never had to sit through any movies like this one.I can't go on. You shouldn't, either. You should read the book, which actually treats all of its characters as fully human, and doesn't labor under the necessity of casting the director's daughter. I will admit, however, that had I not done so, I wouldn't have come on here and read the unintentionally hilarious review by the gentleman who complains that the cast and crew are full of liberals (in a Hollywood movie? Shocking!) who seek to normalize homosexuality (call me crazy, but I don't think Spacey's character is ever intended to be seen as the most normal guy on the planet), and then rants on in the next paragraph about how the movie lacks climax, and therefore he's frustrated and unfulfilled. Any Freudian implications in this are left as an exercise for the reader.

It's very hard to believe because every single person in this movie is clinically insane.This movie surprised & impressed the heck out of me. I thought it would be a straightforward thriller, but it's more like a dark comedy with a deep social message. Sort of like Heathers meets To Kill a Mockingbird.In the tradition of The Unforgiven, director Clint Eastwood again takes us to a place where what you see ain't always what you get. There are 2 sides to every story, and it's just a momentary line that separates the two (as the title says Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil).The plot is almost insignificant in light of this. If you watch this film, focus on the dichotomy of outward appearances vs. what's beneath. At times it's about abstract concepts like loyalty which seems solid on the surface, but when tested it flops like a bad soufflé. At other times the theme is quite literal, as with a flamboyantly feminine woman who's hiding a man's toolbox under her dress, if ya know what I mean. Everyone in this kooky town has some secret deviation, even though they all coexist in an atmosphere of fine southern charm.Watch John Cusack's expressions closely, and I guarantee you'll get a few big LOLs. He plays the role of a New York writer who finds himself in the middle of this bizarre world, struggling to get a grasp of what's real. He spends most of the first half with his mouth wide open in disbelief.The second half is when the plot kicks in, taking us on a murder mystery and its subsequent courtroom drama. Here the film changes to a more serious tone, but the themes remain the same. Don't expect any car chases, shootouts or flashy pyrotechnics. Don't even expect much of a Sherlock Holmesian revelation to the mystery. But if you go into it not knowing what to expect, I think you'll have a great time.

The two are only superficially related.  If Eastwood had made the mistake of trying to film the original account instead of a cinematic version of it, it would indeed have come across as a sort of gay Gone With the Wind on mescaline, and he would have been crucified by critics and viewers alike as a David Lynch wannabe.As it is, he made a commercially viable replica of the original story into a passably successful movie.  But there are flaws.  For one thing, as many comments here assert, the thing is just too long. Internal musings by the author -- the common bond that made the novel a smashing success -- are replaced by visual and audible sensations, some of which are too obviously gratuitous to sustain a complicated plot.  Characters have been altered, sanitized, simplified, or in some cases magnified to make everything fit proportionally into a screen presentation.Nevertheless, I think all the viewers who really liked this film are justified in praising it.  Savannah society is a unique and interesting creature.  Whether you have read the book or not, that much is clear.  The fact that most of the story is true and some of the original players reprise various parts in the screenplay is a delight.  The music of Johnny Mercer fits well.  We can even forgive Clint for casting his daughter in a throwaway role, making Jack Thompson of all people into Sonny Seiler, or wasting Jude Law's talent instead of finding a local actor for that smallish part. I also think Spacey was exactly right for his part, and Cusack never made the mistake of imitating author Berendt.Still, I recommend the book as a far superior vehicle for this particular story.

The best bar-b-q and fried fish was sold at a greasy spoon near the Howard Johnson Lodge where the train crew stayed...and the naughty projects were close by. I was devastated when our contract hotel was moved out of the city. Many of the scenes in this movie are familiar, but there should have been more - like SCAD and the old Central of Georgia train station which hosted the legendary Nancy Hanks streamliner Miss Charlotte rode to and from Atlanta. Savannah - like Charleston and New Orleans - is a true Southern Belle.Kevin Spacey looks and acts like his real life gay character, Jim Williams...and his eyes light up like a Christmas tree whenever John Cusack appears. Is Spacey merely in character or is he simply overcome by Cusack's boyish beauty? Cusack is no great actor but he possesses a cute baby face and a matinée idol appeal that celebrity worshipers and co-stars adore. His naive appeal obviously turns Lady Chablis on and they make a perfectly odd couple. It makes you wonder what happened after they left the black débutante ball - arm in arm headed to her place for a drink.

While in Savannah, Kelso gets involved in murder, voodoo, and some eccentric characters. Kelso is a plot-convenient stand-in for John Berendt, the author of the nonfiction book upon which the film's screenplay was based.With the film's intriguing title, maybe I was expecting too much. I really don't know what director Eastwood was trying to tell us here. The film was cluttered with disjointed subplots, which included a murder and subsequent trial, a romance, a character study of Williams, a parade of strange characters largely irrelevant to other subplots, a travelogue of a Southern city, and some voodoo thrown in.The acting ranged from good (Kevin Spacey) to mediocre to fairly poor. The cinematography and the production design were adequate.This film has entertainment value for Kevin Spacey fans. But the story itself lacked focus, and it led nowhere. Indeed, the ending was ambiguous, in an irritating sort of way.The main problem with Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil was its questionable rationale. Why was it made? Just because a film is based on a true event does not ensure a favorable cinematic outcome, especially if the film's screenplay digresses significantly from its source. Better direction would have helped a lot, as would a complete rewrite of the screenplay, based on a more cohesive premise. "},{"Title":"Very entertaining account of a set of Savannah whackos. Give it a whirl","Date":"29 May 2010","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" In his review of Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil, Roger Ebert writes that you would probably enjoy the film more if you haven't previously read John Berendt's book on which it is based. Well, I haven't read Berendt's book and must report that I rather enjoyed the film. It reminded me of the observation (and I have tracked that down to first being said by Mark Twain, but it might well have been someone else before him) that it's 'a good story well told'. And at the end of the day you can't really ask for more than that. Well, of course you can, but you run the risk of being rather greedy. With Midnight, Clint Eastwood has made a film which is intriguing and entertaining. Admittedly, to do so he has had to adapt Berendt's account of mysterious murder and a very colourful gang of people living in Savannah, Georgia, which has upset purist, but, as I said, I hadn't read the original book, and so I would never have known had I not read other reviews. I always feel filmmakers have an inalienable right to make a film 'based on' rather than 'of' a book because, in essence, they are creating a new piece of art (one hopes) rather than simply transferring a story from one medium to another. Clint Eastwood has made good use of that right and, pertinently, hasn't abused it. So, for example, criticism that he has boiled down the unprecedented four trial antique dealer Jim Williams faced on the charge of murdering a male hustler into one can be countered by observing that including four trials in his film would have meant making a very different film indeed and boiling it down to one (and altering crucial details to do so) makes admirable sense. Those of us who haven't read Berendt's book do not feel short-changed, and the film still stands steadily on its own two feet. The writer portrayed by John Cusack (intended to represent Berendt although he is called Kelso in the film) is the only fictional character, and the rest are all real, which must have presented Eastwood with something close to a legal nightmare in that none of the characters could be portrayed in a bad light or else they might sue for libel. The film also introduces a romance between Kelso and Mandy (who was real but who didn't fall in love with the Kelso character) which in retrospect has absolutely nothing to do with the core of the story. But it does provide a pleasant dimension to the film in as far as Kelso is rather likable and so is Mandy so why not pair them off. There was absolutely no reason to do so, except to add a little love interest to the film, but there again there was absolutely no reason not to it doesn't in the slightest detract from the film, so what the hell. Lady Chablis, the real-life drag queen of portrays himself - herself? - is something of a tour de force. Yet again there is a longish scene when she turns up at a middle-class black prom to which (for some reason not made clear) Kelso has been invited and proceeds to scandalise him which doesn't advance the story very much. It seems more intent on showcasing Lady Chablis' outrageousness, but as it's very entertaining, I feel Eastwood can be forgiven including it. To sum up Midnight is an entertaining account of a series of whackos in Savannah, Georgia, an intriguing murder story and has many good performances, not least from Kevin Spacey as the gay antiques dealer and Cusack as the writer. If you have read Berendt's highly praised book, you might well be disappointed. If, like me, you haven't you won't be. Give it a whirl and you'll find you won't regret having done so.

But in the end I realized that even though the movie didn't line up with the book a lot, it still was very good.I thought the directing was amazing. Clint Eastwood...geez. This is one of his better movies, definitely. Every detail contributes to the story in some way, and that means kudos for both Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock.John Cusack was perfect as John Kelso. He just fit the image perfectly, and his acting was near perfect. I'm still not exactly sure about Kevin Spacey as Jim Williams, Spacey is more laconic and withdrawn that I imagined Williams to be. Paul Hipp and Jude Law also make solid supporting appearances. I was especially pleased with Alison Eastwood as Mandy Nichols, they gave her a much bigger part in the movie than in the book and I think it fit perfectly.Of course, The Lady Chablis was flawless as herself. She was hilarious. To a degree she was a distraction from the trial, but she was always comic relief, especially in the hospital sequences. Irma P. Hall also made a successful performance as Minerva.Everyone in the movie, from Sonny Seiler to the man walking the imaginary dog to Serena Dawes to Luther Driggers and all the way around (no matter how big or small their part was) seemed to have a personal stake in the story and we got to know the characters to the maximum extent with the minimum amount of screen time. To me, that's extremely powerful, and that ensemble feeling makes this movie more than worthwhile for me.

Many users have remarked on the padding that needlessly prolongs the movie, particularly the scenes involving Minerva, the hoodoo practitioner. To that I would add (as being mostly irrelevant) the transvestite entertainer The Lady Chablis. Ironically, however, this padding provides the only real interest the film offers.The acting is good enough. As eccentric millionaire Jim Williams, Kevin Spacey is quite convincing. I have never seen Mr. Spacey give a bad performance. I first saw him in a made-for-tv movie portraying disgraced PTL founder Jim Bakker. That was many years ago, but to this day when I think of Jim Bakker, I picture Kevin Spacey.Producer and director Clint Eastwood should be taken to task for twisting some of the facts. The story is told from the perspective of John Kelso (John Cusack), a magazine reporter from New York who comes to Savannah to cover the annual Christmas party given by Jim Williams. Kelso is really John Berendt, the author of the book on which the movie was based. Berendt is gay, but Kelso is not. The only plausible reason for changing his sexual identity is commercial. Presumably more people (esp. women) will go to a movie featuring a straight man than a gay one, especially when there is romance involved. (Toward this end, a relationship between Kelso and a local woman named Mandy - played by Alison Eastwood - was fabricated for the movie.) While that is probably true, it is mercenary and deceitful, nonetheless.Another inaccuracy is that there were actually four trials, not one. The first trial ended in a guilty verdict and a sentence of life in prison, but was overturned on appeal. It wasn't until eight years after the murder that Williams was finally acquitted. Also, the movie implies that Williams died only days after the trial ended. In fact, he died some six months later. Lastly, the name of the victim was incorrect. His name was Danny Hansford, not Billy Hanson, as it was in the movie. This is a minor point, but I don't know why the name of the deceased was changed, while the name of the accused wasn't. Savannah was previously best known as the home of songwriter Johnny Mercer, and the town that Sherman spared after burning Atlanta. When Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil was published, and even more so after the movie came out, Savannah became known as the city where an infamous murder took place. Interested parties can even take a guided tour of the important sites associated with the crime and trials.

While chatting with Williams about him and his famous parties that anyone whose anyone, in the city of Savannah, just has to be invited too to be considered anyone in pops up Williams' drunk as a skunk house boy Billy Hanson, Jude Law, and in a violent argument with Williams, over his pay, breaks a whiskey bottle and threatens to cut his face up with it! Later as Kelso is trying to overcome this slice of life in Savannah as well as Southern Hospitably, in what he saw between Williams & Hanson, it's reported that Hanson had been found shot to death in the Williams Mansion with Jim Williams being the one who shot him! With Kelso seeing just how wild and dangerous Hanson was towards Williams he ends up being considered a star witness in Williams upcoming murder trial. At first an open and shut case of self-defense on Williams' part things start to surface about him and Hanson that shows that his motives were more of self-preservation, in keeping his darkest of secrets from seeing the light of day, then anything else! In Kelso tracking down Hanson's former landlady the outrageous Chablis Deveau, Lady Chablis, he soon finds out that Hanson was a male hustler who's clients were both men and women with Williams being one of them! In fact Williams made Hanson his personal companion, or gay lover, to be with him at all times even when he went overseas! The fact that Williams was obviously being blackmailed by Hanson, in revealing his closeted gay lifestyle, may have been the reason for his being killed by him.***SPOILER*** As things started to go, no pun intended, south for Williams he in desperation gets in touch with Voodoo Priestess Minerva, Irma P. Hall, to put a hex on the judge and jury trying him to keep Williams from getting convicted and sent away for life if not to Georgia State prison's death row. Kelso who at first believed Williams' account of his killing Hanson in self-defense later had second thoughts about it from none other then Williams himself. Williams in what seem to be a heart felt jail-house confession admitted to a stunned Kelso that he in fact did kill Hanson but out of rage in his planning to expose him, as being gay, then anything else! This shocking revelation on Williams' part had the hex that he had Minerva concocted for him, in a Savannah Voodoo cemetery, backfire on Williams even though he did in fact beat the rap, or murder charge, against him in court!P.S True story based on the best selling book-that was on the prestigious NY Times book review list for an astounding 216 weeks- Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil By John Berendt does bring out the sleazy and supernatural-in regards to Voodoo-aspects of the story. But like in most true stories that are made into movies the truth is far stranger then the movie that was based on it. It's true that Williams, like in the film, was found innocent in Hanson's death but it took four, not one like in the movie, trials to exonerate him. In the first two trials Williams was convicted and the convictions were later overturned by a higher court. The third trial ended up in a mistrial and it was then decided to have a change of venue and try Williams for a forth time in Agusta Ga. where he was finally, after eight years, found innocent of murdering Hanson! Now free and, if what he told Kelso is true, getting away with murder Williams suddenly died at age 59 of complications from pneumonia that lead to heart failure just six months, on January 14, 1990, after he won his freedom! It's as if Miverva's Voodoo hex did in fact work by striking down the guilty person-Jim Williams-she unknowingly conjured it up for!

As many have stated the biggest complaint is the film's seeming lack of focus or purpose. The filler is however entertaining as we meet a host of colorful characters that should draw and maintain the viewer's interest... well at least until you discover that the screenwriter and Eastwood have somehow lost their way. Of particular note is Kevin Spacey's performance as the lead character Jim Williams. In addition to nailing his accent, his performance was excellent as an eccentric art dealer, southern gentleman and closet homosexual that is accused of murdering his hustling thug-lover (played by Jude Law). Though I admire Jude Law's other work, regretfully I thought his brief moments on screen here were amateurish, over-acted and well... downright horrid. He paced and posed during his ill-accented rants with all the composure and talent of a jock making a cameo in a high school play. That aside I enjoyed the cast as a whole. As surreal as the setting and characters seemed, their characterizations actually made them believable. I've noted a few criticizing Lady Chablis' excessive use in the film. I agree to a point but I saw her as less comic relief and more a metaphor for the town as a whole. The drag-queen's performance of herself was exceptional with a depth that suggested there was much more to her (and Savannah) than was immediately obvious.I suppose that was the best attribute I noted of the film, if I'm kind to Eastwood. I'm a southerner and most films based on the the south tend to portray a very one-dimensional view, whether positive or negative... cruel or genteel. Indeed, Savannah in both the book and movie is in a way a caricature of itself. But EVERYONE, every society, has a story that goes beyond the simplistic. At least I noted an attempt to reveal the humanity of the south and depth of its citizens (the good, bad and ugly).

It's a bit long for most people, but most of Mr. Eastwood's films generally run a bit on the long side. I loved the languorous pacing of the whole thing. The film takes its time showing us Savannah, its people, its character, and its dark side. Kevin Spacey gives a performance that should have won an Oscar. John Cusack is excellent here. I find him rather one note most of the time, but he blends in very well here. The most surprising performance here goes to Jack Thompson as Spacey's lawyer. Thompson is actually an Australian actor (who was in Breaker Morant years ago), yet he does the Southern style so well you'd think he was raised in Savannah. Jude Law is mesmerizing in one of his early roles, and all the support players are excellent. There isn't one bad performance in the whole film. Sometimes in Eastwood's films there are supporting performances that are a bit rough, but here that doesn't happen. The most intriguing performance, if you can call it that, goes to The Lady Chablis, an actual transvestite performer who resides in Savannah. The scene where she goes to the cotillion is one of the best scenes in the entire film. She has grace, dignity, and mystique, and Clint lets the camera linger on her. Along with The Lady Chablis, Spacey's character is homosexual. In Thompson's final argument during the murder trial, he talks about his client's homosexuality, but says if God thinks it's a sin, then God should judge it. The generally positive portrayals of Spacey's character and Chablis show that a film can contain a message, yet be subtle about it and not hammer you over the head with it. Most Hollywood films that have gay characters in them always have that tolerance speech in them, as if the viewer is an idiot (well, some viewers are) and has to have everything spoon fed to her or him. Eastwood reportedly got some flack from right wing commentators over this film, primarily for his portrayal of the homosexual characters. Eastwood has identified himself generally as a Republican, but he seems more of a libertarian than anything else. Eastwood's films have always had digs at people who try and dictate your conduct (Bridges of Madison County has a powerful scene in a diner commenting on this), and this film is consistent with that point of view. Some have argued that this film is a horrible adaptation of the book. I haven't read it, but the film itself is very well done.

The oddities that pervade the city, and the people.While not a commercially huge film, this is one of my favorite films about the South. Spacey's performance is spot on, and beautiful to watch. Lady Chablis lends an air of authenticity for the quirky city.The tale unfolds well--Eastwood becomes very much a teller of tales with how he lets the story roll out. It's natural, it flows well. Different than a number of his previous films, and far different than his later films, it's probably my favorite of his films--not because Eastwood isn't in it, but because he is focused on telling a good yarn.The film illustrates why I love the South. It's a tale that focuses on the dual nature of the South. The innocence, the corruption, the gentility and crassness, the pleasantness of conversation, and the daggers that those conversations contain. A lot of films about the South like to hide the ugly side of the land. Try to ignore it. And being a Southerner, I can understand that drive, because when you want to show off the land you love, you want to put forth its best face--but this film is about revealing the face of Savannah, and it is a city of many colors and flavors, and that richness of history is what makes her a grand city. To fully appreciate her, you have to understand her fully, and in that sense, Lady Chablis makes a grand metaphor for how complicated a lady like Savannah can be.It's not a typical murder mystery. It's not really a comedy. But this is one of best films that Eastwood directed.For those who loved the book, it may be disappointing, in that its focus is narrow--and it has to be, considering the breadth that the book covers, but it preserves the feel of the wonder of the city, and her people, and in that, I think that it does the book a service. If you've only seen the film, by all means, go and read John Berendt's wonderful book, and you'll not be disappointed. If you've held off from watching the film because you don't think it will hold a candle the gentle and majestic sweep of language that Berendt treated the city with, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

It is extremely difficult to portray the book's most intricate and interesting characters in a mere two hours, and it definitely shows in Clint Eastwood's adaptation of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.One of Eastwood's foibles were casting his daughter as fiancee to Joe Odom (a great character in the book). A romance between her the fictitious writer Kelso (John Cusack) is a ridiculous addition to the film. What would have been best was to have Berendt play himself in the movie, despite the fact that Cusack does a good job with Kelso. The best part of the novel is the sexual tension between the gay Berendt and the murderous antiques dealer, Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey) and it is missed from the film.Also, there is Lady Chablis overkill. Lady Chablis was merely a supporting character in the book. To inflate her role in this way merely because she was playing herself is pure foolishness and vanity. It is sad that the real sexual relationships in the book are overshadowed by silly comic relief from the drag queen Chablis. It just goes to show how uncomfortable Hollywood is with serious gay characters and how funny cross-dressers are the only accepted queer roles.Good points about the film? Kevin Spacey, as usual, puts his all into his role as Jim Williams and the Savannah cinematography is superb. Other than that, the film tends to drag and the performances and the ending are not particularly interesting. Do yourself a favor and rent the movie before you read the book.

In the complex lead, Kevin Spacey never resorts to stereotypical swishiness or actorly twitches, and John Cusack (as the jittery out-of-town journalist who tracks the case) is terrific as well for different reasons (Spacey exudes sexual mystery, while Cusack is a rattled innocent). Film is an oddly merry mélange of eccentric characters, decadent atmospherics, and courtroom theatrics. It is occasionally ponderous (with talky passages), but has been directed (by Clint Eastwood, of all people) with surprising inspiration.

I mean there are no cinematic thunderbolts involved. It flows along, rich in atmosphere, switching about half-way through from a tourist's view of Savannian eccentrics to a rather ordinary courtroom drama.It's one of Eastwood's better movies, about at the level of, say, Bird and Play Misty For Me, although entirely different in content. One of the reasons it's as good as it is, is Bumstead's art direction. I can BELIEVE that this is Jim's or Sonny's home, so tasteful, elegant, and expensive.Another reason is the performance of Kevin Spacey, who has been good elsewhere but never better than here as the slyly cynical, secretive, supercilious Sonny. (Sorry about that.) God, he's just great. He sort of WAFTS through the first part of the movie, just barely suggesting his bisexuality, enjoying his cigars and reveling in his money and good taste. John Cusack is a reliable sort of everyman. His character, Kelso, evidently didn't exist in the book. I didn't read the book but I did catch excerpts in the New Yorker. But the character is useful here, the way any newbie is useful when we're being introduced to a relatively odd social world. As a writer sent from New York he has to have things explained to him, and they are thus explained to the viewer. The novice character is a useful shorthand expository device. Eastwood's daughter looks the part and is very attractive. Sonny's lawyer is a good ol' boy who proclaims proudly to the jury and the judge and the spectators in the courtroom that he has no idea who the writer Hobbes was, but he knows who Perry Mason was. There aren't that many places in the country where ignorance is a point of pride. He kvells he as confesses this, jes' folks, you know? I enjoyed the judge too, played by the guy who was Sonny's real trial lawyer. There are assorted people of unusual character on display. A guy who walks a dog that isn't there. Some guy surrounded by bees. A voodoo priestess. A (gasp) transvestite show girl, Lady Chablis, of whom a little goes a long way. People carry loaded guns to Christmas parties. Sonny and some others are either gay or bisexual. But they are mostly harmless clownish figures. At one point Cusack calls his editor and says, These people are really weird. New York is boring. Is he supposed to be kidding?The fact is that they actually are pretty eccentric, at least the particular social circles we get to see, but they're odd in a user-friendly way, polite, articulate, sensitive to the impression they make on an outsider, blasé about most things including murder. Sonny went and shot someone -- have some crab cakes? The thing I remember best about the excerpts from the book is the meeting of the lady's bridge club or whatever it is. It's only a snippet in the film, although an enjoyable one, what with the twittering belles all dressed in pink and white flounces and wearing broad-brimmed hats. In real life, as far as I can recall, these little luncheons could have served as a movie unto themselves. The host's door never opened until the scheduled second. The ladies knew one another and were ushered into the parlor where they chatted about circumscribed topics and were served two extremely potent drinks, so they were all smashed within an hour of their arrival. (No men allowed, of course.) They were served a light lunch after a predetermined interval and left precisely at the same time after each meeting. The whole affair was as highly ritualized as a church service.Nice use is made of locations. What we see is what might be called the aesthetic component of the community. The houses are painted in pastels and are well kept up. (There's another Savannah that we don't get to see.) Parts of Charleston look picturesque like that too. What we see in the colored cemetery isn't voodoo, at least it's not what passes for voodoo in Haiti. It might be called folk spiritualism. The cemetery is an atmospheric place though. Eastwood heightens the effect by having incense smoke drift through the tombstones. (He lapses into another cliché later, when Sonny dies. A man gets dizzy and the camera spins around in a circle.) The statue of the placid young girl, holding a scale in each hand, is a striking image. (She has since been removed for her own safety after the movie was released) The score is by Lennie Niehaus, who used to play an accomplished alto sax in Stan Kenton's band. The courtroom drama is competently done, no more than that.This is worth watching, if not worth watching too often. I could have done with less of Lady Chablis and her tootsie roll. She isn't as funny or shocking as she and Eastwood seem to think she is.

Indeed, if you read the book, you'd be way past page 100 before any reference to the murder appears. The killing of Danny Hansford by Jim Williams was used largely as a pretext by author John Berendt as an excuse to pen an affectionate travelogue about the city of Savannah, Georgia; it's largely a leisurely tour of the city and a genteel introduction to many of the city's quirkier citizens.Clint Eastwood's movie version of MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL is only about the murder, more or less, with most of the colorful characters edited out or reduced to crude jokes. And for all the location filming that Eastwood did in Savannah, he could just as easily have shot the entire film on the Universal backlot. Devoid of local color or a quixotic taste for the off beat and amusing, MIDNIGHT ends up playing as though it were an uninspired pilot for an unsold TV series. Berendt's book just begged to be translated to the big screen by someone unconventional like Robert Altman, someone with the knack for and an interest in ensemble dramas and a slightly skewed vision of the world -- not someone conventional, albeit talented, like Eastwood. The book's charm was in its varied vignettes and casual observations about a city straddling two mindsets clinging to the decorum of the antebellum past while thriving in the pulsating, diverse present. The problem is that in stripping the story down to the basics of the murder trial, it becomes obvious that the trial isn't all that interesting in the first place.After a quarrel, wealthy antiques dealer Williams kills his young male lover (played by Jude Law and now renamed Billy Carl Hanson) and claims it is self defense. Killing is one thing, but the well-to-do of the city are aghast at just how uncouth Williams' behavior appears to be as the ensuing trial brings to light Savannah's hush-hush gay subculture. Though in Eastwood's hands it is less straight versus gay than rich versus poor; as Williams lies and manipulates to get away with murder, there is more than a hint of plantation owner entitlement in the way he justifies his behavior throughout. The problem is, that as played with his usual unctuous arrogance, Kevin Spacey never makes Williams either likable or remarkable. What made the case notable was that the ordeal was stretched out over several years and four lengthy trials that highlighted Williams' cunning nature and taxed the patience of even the most benevolent of Savannah's citizens, all of which the filmmakers condense into one trial and a handful of cliché courtroom moments.What Eastwood retains beyond the truncated murder trail is limited in its effectiveness. The book's element of voodoo is present, but done with little sense of mysticism. Minerva, the voodoo priestess played Irma P. Hall, comes off as little more than a crazy old lady stereotype and her midnight visit to the said garden (a cemetery) lacks the power to either give one the creeps or even cause nervous laughter. A huge chunk of the movie is surrendered to The Lady Chablis, a secondary character in the book and the trial. I suppose Eastwood found it positively shocking to have a black drag queen traipsing around amongst the normal citizens, but in the film the character is less a jolt than a bore. Despite being played by the real person, Lady Chablis (a.k.a. Chablis Deveau, a.k.a. Benjamin Edward Knox) seems woefully miscast and seems more tacky than eccentric or outrageous.The worse part of the film is its rather blunt homophobia. Having sidestepped the major point of the book -- the gentle weirdness of the characters -- to focus on the trial, the film then tries to make a gay story seem as straight as possible. The Williams murder trial made public an open secret, that a gay world existed behind the facades of the southern mansions and it was discreetly apparent, quietly tolerated, yet never, never discussed. When a prominent citizen kills his male lover, that sort of don't-ask-don't-tell etiquette is difficult to maintain. The filmmakers deal with the gay issues, but someone (Eastwood, screenwriter John Lee Hancock, the studio?) clearly did not want to make a gay film. Thus homosexuality is treated more like a dirty little scandal rather than a naughty little secret; something to be held at arm's length or viewed as a rude little joke, like Lady Chablis. For instance, the gay author of the book, John Berendt, is played by John Cusack as John Kelso, and the film makes a point of letting us know he is definitely heterosexual and drives home the point by giving him a female romantic interest not in the book (and played curiously enough by Clint's own daughter, Alison Eastwood). Such cinematic bearding is standard issue for the skin-deep liberalism that Hollywood so righteously embraces.Other than being eager to exploit a pre-sold bestseller, it is hard to figure just why this film was made at all. The true crime element has been fictionalized, it's gay themes sanitized, the quirky characters marginalized and the town itself homogenized into banality. Neither good or evil, a story about a time and a place and a people ends up being a movie about nothing in particular and no one of any interest. "},{"Title":"Simply dreadful","Date":"30 July 2010","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" John Berendt's acclaimed fact-based novel ostensibly focusing on the trial of a rich effete gay man accused of murdering his volatile younger lover was really little more than a frame on which to hang various vignettes documenting the over-the-top eccentricities of the denizens of Savannah, Georgia. Although the novel was quite entertaining, its structure did not readily lend itself to cinema and it would take a real virtuoso to pull off such a transition into a coherent whole. Clint Eastwood is not that director. There is a misconception in Hollywood that based on two undeserved directing Oscars, Eastwood is some sort of amazing filmmaker. All one need do is sit through this effort to see the folly. Eastwood has no idea how to pace the film and it jarringly shifts from pure tedium to slapstick comedy on a dime. The odious screenplay attempts to tie characters who had no interaction with each other in the novel together in badly conceived ways - cutting out many things that were essential and adding ludicrous scenes that make no sense at all. He also elicits uniformly awful performances from his cast. Everything in the novel is conveyed through the eyes of the author who functions as little more than an observer - this does not give John Cusack (who plays the Berendt surrogate) many notes to play and the result is one of his most forgettable performances. Eastwood has no idea how to impart the correct tone or atmosphere to the film. The novel spent some time depicting the amazing parties given by Kevin Spacey's accused murderer being the talk of Savannah where everyone clamored for an invite. Eastwood opens with such a party, which is depicted in the film as a tired dull gathering of a handful of drunk unbalanced wackos basically meandering around the room in an aimless fashion. This sequence should introduce the players and set the tone, but Eastwood cannot even make it remotely interesting. For a better example, see the opening party scene in Robert Altman's The Gingerbread Man. Spacey has never been worse than he is here and Jude Law equals him as the doomed lover. Alison Eastwood shows up for a shot of nepotism in a role beefed up to absurd proportions. Charitable audiences may forget Australian actor Jack Thompson appears in the film. The only signs of life come from The Lady Chablis (played by himself/herself), a transgendered character from the novel. Apparently realizing this, Eastwood has bulked up the role, but the problem is that Chablis chews the scenery and runs over top of the other performers. Yes, Chablis' scenes are the only memorable ones in the film, but the campiness of them are at odds with the rest of soporific mess and only manage to emphasize its considerable shortcomings. My advice would be to skip this terribly directed mess and pick up a copy of the novel.

Midnight in the garden of good and evil (1997) remains generally badly perceived by most of his fans. However, I think it deserves a little better than the mixed reputation although it is not to be ranked among Eastwood's best work.An adaptation of a best-seller, Midnight... can be read both as a judicial movie and a portrayal description. About this second point, the town of Savannah is well highlighted; its Southern atmosphere is particularly enhanced by an original photograph. A little like John Cusack, you are under the fascination of this town with its colorful inhabitants and which bathes in a moist heat. If the inhabitants of Savannah correspond to the description made of them in the film, then truth is stranger than fiction. Beside this description which would be almost worthy of an entomologist, a murder trial takes place. It constitutes the unifying thread of the movie and turns out to be quite gripping in its evolution. Kevin Spacey is accused of having killed his lover Jude Law. In the end, he will give the image of a dishonest man. Indeed, he will prefer to lie about what really happened (he killed Law) and so will be acquitted. Fortunately, the end of the movie is here to remind us the triumph of justice (Spacey will die of a heart attack after his victory). It is the opportunity for Eastwood to confront the notions of good and evil which shows that religion occupies a quite important place in his mind.That said, Eastwood's opus is not a major work for the following reasons the main reproach made to the film-maker is that his movie was much too long. I agree with that. Eastwood shot an overlong movie which often drags on. It could have easily been amputated of half an hour. One can also regret that the disclosure of the truth about Law's murder (when Spacey explains to Cusack the real version of the facts) only appears very belatedly in the film as if Eastwood wanted to keep the best till last. On another hand, the cast remains patchy. Eastwood was wrong to give a role to his daughter Alison who almost acts a decorative role. Let's also regret Jude Law in a much too short apparition.Eastwood's master of making is no longer in doubt but the quoted shortcomings are too important and stop the movie to take its place among Eastwood's best films.

John Cusack, a reporter from New York, is sent to a rich guy from Savannah, Kevin Spacey, to write a story about the Christmas Party. It all turns bad when Spacey's character kills somebody and he'll have to face trial for first degree murder. It is not only a simple classic crime movie. Just like in the novel (so i've read in other comments - i don't know the book), Eastwood tries to re-build the atmosphere and the life style from Savannah, the people living there and their habits.  John Cusack is better than usual in the role of a reporter, still his character isn't built very good. Kevin Spacey is more than great, as usual, and plays another fabulous role as the accused millionaire.Still there are some things that go wrong.

Then there's the plot it's a normal crime-story, with a murder, then investigations (still this time they are not presented through the eyes of the police, almost absent throughout the whole movie, but through the eyes of the nosy reporter), and of course the trial. Plus a predictable ending. No twists and turns, no surprises. Just a plain old story. I don't see what's the point of Lady Chablis in the movie, she (he) is present in too many scenes, and also the relationship between Cusack and Alison Eastwood (Mandy in the film) kind of developes out of nothing.

The movie is the story of a prominent citizen in a Southern town who commits a crime and then attempts to conceal it.  Rightfully, the motivations of Kevin Spacey's character should have taken center stage in this film.  Instead, the story is told through the eyes of a magazine reporter, played by John Cusack.Through the reporter's eyes, we get all sorts of details that are not relevant to the outcome of the film.  The story of the reporter's developing friendship with Spacey's character, who describes himself as nouveau riche, may have been intended to lend an ornate atmosphere to the film.  In the end, however, it does not satisfactorily explain Spacey's character's motive for his crime.  In fact, the interplay between Cusack's and Spacey's characters only serves to bog down this film and strangle its intent.  The magazine reporter is primarily an observer, like the movie audience, and his contribution to the motivation of the lead character or its explanation is minimal.  In the final analysis, the magazine reporter and what he thinks or does are irrelevant to the climax of the film.It may be that director Clint Eastwood wanted to present an eccentric morality tale a la William Faulkner's best work.  Like Faulkner, Eastwood may have wanted to show how merciless consequences flow from actions founded upon evil motivations and false principles. His message may be and likely is that impartial justice will catch up with the person who knowingly and willfully violates it.  Eastwood's best films, as a director and an actor, have concerned a more direct confrontation of his characters with an impartial standard of justice, often personified by Eastwood himself.  Consider High Plains Drifter and Pale Rider which, for this genre, are far superior films to this one. In Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil, director Eastwood has simply gotten in over his head, tried to do too much with the material.Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil may have been conceived in the tradition of great films associated with Clint Eastwood, but the focus of the story as directed is wrong and the action is tedious.  The movie leaves its viewer feeling confused and suffocated by the sultry Southern humidity.  I give this movie two stars (* *), which is more kind than I ought to be.

At the party John meets Williams' eccentric friends among who Billy Hanson, local bad boy and drunk who seems to have a very close relationship with Jim. Later that night Billy winds up getting killed by Jim, who claims it was self-defense. Kelso decides to stick around for Jim's trial, who has been accused of murder. John decides to write a book about it and when doing some research he discovers that nothing is quite like it seems...Spacey is marvelous as always, though his accent could've been better. He walks around with so much flair in a room you'd really think he's the arrogant aristocrat he portrays. Cusack is surprisingly good as he steers away from his normal charmers acting style. His 2nd best role (Runaway Jury is his best). Jack Thompson does a good job portraying the southern lawyer. He tries a little too hard at times but he's believable. The other actors deliver OK performances.The storyline has strange twists and turns and I kind of got the feeling Eastwood was trying to put too much literally from the book in the 2 hour film. He therefore puts a lot of emphasis on matters that don't seem very important and leaves other matters unsolved. For instance Lady Chablis didn't have a huge influence on the outcome of the trial but she still gets a lot of screen time. I haven't read the book but it's hard to believe the story in the book had such a strange build-up as it did in the movie. The story did keep me interested throughout the whole movie but there was a little too much filling( elements unrelated to the story). I was a bit disappointed by the anti-climax in the very ending. The twist a bit before that, then again, was very nice.The dialog in the movie was brilliant, especially the first hour of the movie. Clever writing without being pretentious...loved it.Midnight...is a good detective/film noir that keeps the public intrigued and rewards them in the end as they should be.

Kevin Spacey was entirely credible as a sophisticated Southern gentleman; Cusack as the reporter might have shown more range but he played off the other characters well enough. Knowing nothing of the actor who portrayed Lady Chablis, imagine my surprise when I learned that he/she was actually a real person. That might explain the lack of an award nomination, there isn't a category. The line on the witness stand about having a 'man's toolbox' was the best.This was quite the entertaining story, with a twist that makes the innocent Jim Williams guilty, capitalizing on a police error to ride out the jury trial. Mysterious forces at work bring him to justice however, cleverly linked by the midnight handiwork of priestess Minerva and the restless spirit of the murdered Billy.

My favorite line is where Joe Odom sees Mandy after Jerry has given her a haircut at one of his parties something like let me introduce you to the future ex-Mrs. Odom.Overall, this is a great, wonderful and magical film.

This movie is like a long, sultry summer day in Savannah, and the film can seem rather slow at points if you're uninterested in character-driven drama.  I found it fascinating and a worthy adaptation from John Behrendt's book of the same name.I can't think of a single problem with the acting and can name several bright spots.  Kevin Spacey is outstanding as Jim Williams and Jack Thompson shines equally as his attorney.  The true highlight, though, is the Lady Chablis playing herself.  At certain points she seems to take the movie on her shoulders and carries it along.  Geoffrey Lewis, often a featured actor in Eastwood's movies, turns in the quirkiest performance as Luther Driggers, the real-life inventor of the No-Pest Strip who was screwed out of the profits and has become sort of a recluse in Savannah.  Even Eastwood's daughter Allison turns in a solid performance.However, the one part that bothered me about the movie (even before I read the book) was the romance sub-plot involving John Cusack (as John Kelso, the character based on Behrendt) and Mandy, Allison Eastwood's character.  It seemed contrived and false, and reading the book, you find no mention of it.  It's almost as if Clint thought, What this story needs is a little romance, and wrote it into the script.Besides this, though, the movie is lyrical and moving, manages to maintain an air of detachment and objectivity, and presents the lovely city of Savannah in a unique and (I believe) flattering light.  Definitely worth the time to watch, and after watching it, make sure you have the book handy.  You'll want to start reading it right away.

I avoided watching this movie for a long time, as the DVD front, and back cover did not intrigue me, then tonight, I thought, I'll give this a try.With Clint Eastwood directing, you figure the movie has to be good. Clint wouldn't pick a horrible script to shoot would he??? (Oh yes he would, and this is it) I started out enjoying the film, and as time went on, like maybe 40 minutes, I started realizing that nothing was happening, with the exception of learning about Savanna, Georgia, and the weird, quirky people who live there.The movie is way too long. I still cannot believe I watched the entire movie, but I did. I guess I was hoping for something great to happen.That voodoo lady in the movie laughing, gets annoying really quick, and this nonsense about voodoo,etc in my opinion just helped the movie go down the drain.Ghost is a great movie starring Demi Moore, and Patrick Swayze, and if you're interested in spirits,etc,etc, I suggest you watch that, or watch it again for the 10th time before ever watching this piece of junk.Someone on here said the best scene was when they visited the graveyard for the first time. WRONG!!! The best scene in this movie, is the last frame of the 35mm film, and when you know the movie is finally over.This is one of the most disappointing films I have ever witnessed, and I'm not saying that going in with an attitude of expecting anything great, and then being disappointed. As I said previously, the DVD cover, and and back cover did not intrigue me, and I wasn't expecting anything great, but I expected a decent movie.

Terrible, slow paced, and truly not worth watching.Some of the same people who say that RIGHTEOUS KILL was no good, will then in turn say that this movie here was great.RIGHTEOUS KILL gets a bad rap and was a great film.My advice, watch MYSTIC RIVER 100 times, but stay away from this snail of a pace movie.

That is an understatement, I walked out before the movie was over. John did a great job with the book but Clint really screwed up when he made the movie; first with the casting. John's role played by John Cusack is ridiculous. I only met John Berendt once but I certainly would not cast young and somewhat sexy John Cusack to play him. Tony Randall would have been a nice choice. I know people are enthralled with Kevin Spacey's role as Jim, but I was not impressed. Not only did they look nothing alike, Kevin played Jim as a much more sophisticated and elegant man than he actually was. Yes Jim had his money and the friends who accompany it, but he was more of a foul mouthed and overly loud man who lacked social graces, at least when he was in the company of other gay men. When I first met him in '88, I was new to town and had no idea who he was or what he had done. He introduced himself as a murderer that I must be familiar with because he was on the cover of some magazine at one time (this was years before the book). Then he spilled his drink on me with out even so much as an apology. To say the least, I stayed far away from him whenever I saw him out. Okay, so Kevin would not have known the real Jim Williams, but Clint could have done a little more research so that he could be portrayed realistically. Chablis did the best job of acting in the entire movie. That is sad to say because all she was doing was playing herself. At least Clint didn't miss it on casting that time. As far as another Savannah local playing himself, Jerry Spence should have been fired and someone who could deliver a line chosen. I still have no idea what he was saying in his few lines. Then there is the storyline. John's book told a fascinating story that made people want to go to Savannah. Clint's rendition of Savannah made it into a caricature of itself with a boring story and horrible acting. Skip the movie and read the book if you want a real taste of what Savannah was like during the 1980s.

Here he meets a bevy of eccentric characters, one of whom is Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey), a rich landowner and closeted homosexual. When Jim is accused of murdering a man, Kelso proceeds to document the case.At its best, Midnight works as a humble noir in which Kelso navigates the seedy underworld of Savannah. Eastwood has loftier intentions, though, and so his film eventually degenerates into a pretentious attempt to say something about fate, justice, local spiritualism, bigotry, homosexuality and power. By its last act, Midnight feels more like an attempt to quickly tick boxes and hastily close plot threads than an organic film. Local drag queen Lady Chablis co-stars.6/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

Wealthy socialite Jim Williams (Spacey) invites writer John Kelso (Cusack) to cover one of his highly esteemed parties at Christmas. However, complications arise when a man, an acquaintance of Williams' is shot following an argument over money. Kelso decides to stick around and write up the case, but is there more going on here than meets the eye? Guilty of overstuff, Eastwood's adaptation of the novel is well acted and directed, but several elements, most prominently a voodoo shaman (hence the story's title), go nowhere or add to the themes of power, relationships and prejudice. At two and half hours, it just feels like screenwriter John Lee Hancock didn't know what else to cut (apparently, the one trial of the film was four in reality), and so there are strands here that simply don't add to the main thrust of the narrative as we learn more about what really happened with Williams. The voodoo aspect is maybe 10% of the film, and is honestly only here because it explains the title, and an event that happens later in the film that has an alternate explanation.Still, those elements don't entirely eclipse a fairly engaging legal drama, giving you a decent lens into the investigation and methods of the trial, as well as a stellar performance from Spacey. He's alternately charming and smooth, a man you'd like to be around, yet you sense something's amiss and that's there more going on under the surface. Plus, the film has a good sense of humour about itself, be it with Williams or with Lady Chablis, a transgender performer who has ties to the victim and often plays around with Kelso, including a pretty fun bit in an ER.In the end 'Midnight' is in the mid tier of Eastwood's filmography well made and entertaining, but bloated and maybe needed a rethink or different writer to tighten it up. Still, it's leagues better than 'J. Edgar' or some of his recent works.

"},{"Title":"A Good Time Not Yet Had by All","Date":"22 December 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" As an actor Clint Eastwood tended to specialise in action movies; although there were occasional exceptions such as Play Misty for Me, his default settings were tough cowboy or tough cop, occasionally tough soldier or tough spy. As a director, however, he has had a wider range, alternating action films with other genres, as in the recent musical biopic Jersey Boys. His Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is partly a crime drama, but it is also much more than that. Jim Williams, a wealthy businessman from Savannah, Georgia is charged with murder following the death of his gay lover Billy Hanson. Williams admits shooting Hanson but claims that the killing was self-defence, an explanation which may well be true as Hanson, an alcoholic and drug abuser, had a notoriously unpredictable temper and had been heard making threats against Williams. When I saw the film recently I assumed that the story was a fictitious one and that John Berendt's book on which it is based must be a novel. In fact, the book is a work of non-fiction based upon real-life events which took place in the 1980s. Jim Williams was a real person, as is his lawyer Sonny Seiler. (Seiler appears in the movie playing not himself but the presiding judge at the trial). John Kelso, the reporter covering the case, is based on Berendt himself and Hanson on Williams's real- life lover Danny Hansford. Some changes were, however, made for dramatic purposes in the film. In reality Williams was actually tried four times when juries failed to agree, making him the only man in the history of Georgia to stand four times for the same alleged crime. (He was eventually acquitted, but died shortly afterwards). Here, however, the four trials are combined into one. The film is more than just a courtroom thriller, although the trial plays an important part. It is also a portrait of Southern society in the late twentieth century. The city of Savannah almost features as a character in its own right, genteel but faded in best Southern Gothic style, with its genteel but faded houses, dating back to the pre-Civil War era, inhabited by genteel but faded families, some of them also dating back to the pre-Civil War era. There are a number of colourful or eccentric characters, such as the black drag queen Lady Chablis (apparently another real-life individual, here playing herself), the voodoo priestess Minerva, a man who regularly takes an imaginary dog for a walk and another who goes everywhere accompanied by flies and makes regular threats to poison the city's water supply. Remarkably, this last is selected as a juror at Williams's trial without either side objecting to him, despite his obvious mental instability. It is Minerva who carries out, at Williams's behest, the bizarre voodoo ceremony which gave the book and film their title; she explains that the period before midnight is the time for good magic and the period after midnight that for evil magic. Films set in the South- To Kill a Mockingbird being a good example- often revolve around issues of race and social class, to which this one adds issues of sexual identity and sexual orientation. Savannah is portrayed as a deeply traditional place, dominated by its traditional leading families. Not all of these are white; Kelso is invited to a black debutantes' ball which seems to have been organised with the express purpose of demonstrating that the city has its black aristocracy as well as a white one. We learn that Williams is a nouveau-riche parvenu from a humble social background, but he is accepted by the elite because his style, elegance and gentlemanly ways mean that he has learned to behave like one of them. Although the elite traditionally disapproves of homosexuality in principle they turn a blind eye to his relationship with Hanson, partly because he keeps it discreet and partly because the bisexual Hanson- the good time not yet had by all- has had love affairs with several members of that elite, both men and women. Lady Chablis is also tolerated, largely because people find her amusing, but when Kelso tries to take her as his guest to the debutantes' ball she is decidedly not welcome. There are two excellent acting performances. The first comes from Kevin Spacey as Williams, whose pose as a quiet, elegant Southern gentleman may hide some murky secrets. The second comes from Jack Thompson as Sonny Seiler, a larger-than-life, ebullient character who, like his client, may be putting up a facade. Seiler's outward persona, which he uses to charm juries, is that of the simple Southern good ol' boy, but there can be no doubt that beneath it he is hiding a razor-sharp legal brain. Hanson is played by Jude Law who in the same year (1997) also played the homosexual lover of an older man in Wilde, where he was Lord Alfred Douglas to Stephen Fry's Oscar Wilde.When the came out film critical reviews were mixed and it was not a success at the box office. Yet to my mind it should have been. It is a good example of Eastwood's directorial ability- others include Unforgiven and the more recent Gran Torino-to combine the conventions of various types of action movie- the Western, the war film or the crime thriller- with some sharp social comment, thus producing something which not only works well as a drama but also says something of greater significance. 8/10 "}{"Title":"interesting eccentrics but not engaging","Date":"17 December 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" John Kelso (John Cusack) is a writer from Town and Country magazine.

But, overall, the winner goes to The Lady Chablis. She was amazing. And her interactions between her and John were key to the film's success for me. Okay, not just those scenes, but certainly a huge highlight whenever I revisit this film.Another great aspect of MITGOGAE was the setting and cinematography. The John Kelso character is out of his element in this Deep South surrounding and you'd be lying if you don't get swooped up right along with him, exploring on your own the differences from your world and this one. I get just as mesmerized as he is with all that this film sets up in regards to characters, landscaping, the houses and, heck, even the town is a character.Further, the story, a film noir mystery with multiples of twists, is as exciting to us as the onion peals back as it is to John Kelso. It's a murder mystery with intrigue and intelligence. Spacey and his character Jim Williams are both flipping interesting and exciting, it's absolutely a joy to watch him from scene to scene as he's caught up in this.Basically, writer John Kelso gets a freelance 500-word assignment he thinks he was randomly assigned to, to cover the annual extravagant Jim Williams' Christmas Party. Bummed it's not that big of an article, one-time novelist John Kelso begins his reporting when a self-defense murder takes place.

I will tell you that I was predisposed to think that it would not be handled well, but I was pleasantly surprised.All in all, this movie manages to do a good job of condensing the book into a non-butt-busting film length, while remaining generally faithful to it. The length and the slowness of the movie are really the only ways to convey the meanderings of the book. It's part of the way this movie creates the slow Southern atmosphere that is such an integral part of the story. Savannah is a character in the book, and the only unifying force other than the author.  It's easier to convey that in words than pictures, but Eastwood has done a good job of getting the point across here.The casting is mostly great, particularly the supporting characters.  Irma P. Hall's portrayal of Minerva is somehow soothing and slightly menacing, just as the woman seems in the book.  I didn't know how the casting of the actual Chablis would affect the film, but she really delivers the goods without seeming like stunt casting.I was irritated by what I felt were John's and Chablis' too-active roles in the court case, but I suppose I can understand the reasoning behind it.  I don't have to like it, but I understand it.  Just as irritating, and entirely disposable, was the romantic subplot. These two elements seemed out of the role of observer that Berendt makes for himself the book. Also, the Mandy character is sapped by taking a big, beautiful, interesting woman and making her a generic cute chick. Alison Eastwood does what she can with this bland creation, but I have a feeling that the movie character never would have been featured the book.No, it's not the book, but no movie ever could be. A slavish adaptation would have been a truly boring film, not to mention way longer than this effort. (Can you say, Just rent the AudioBook?) And no, it's not a twisting, turning thrill-ride, because the book isn't exactly jam-packed with plot.  It is, however, a decent movie if viewed on its own terms and for its own merits.  And after you've read the book.

He really was a specialist in home renovation, particularly in historic homes, where he made his fortune.  He really did earn his place in Savannah society and was known for his annual Christmas parties. He really was known for his slow banter and love of cigarillo cigars. He really was a discreet homosexual and did indeed throw a bachelor's party the night before his Christmas party. He really did shoot his gay lover and he really did go to trial for it.  And yes, he really did die after being acquitted of the murder, but it was not the day after the trial as the movie implies.  Whether or not he saw his victim's ghost is a matter of opinion.I haven't read the book (yet), but I have seen the film.  The film is worth watching on a long Summer's night when the wind is blowing through the Spanish moss and crickets are chirping somewhere off in the swamps.

In the end, the jury acquits the accused, but the accused also reveals that he had actually lied about the murder.I have a hard time figuring out the point (and genre) of the story. All along, we are pulled along to root for a court room drama that seems on path to being about overcoming small town prejudice to free an innocent man. But then at the end the man's innocence is put in question. So the resolution feels weird. The town is also weird (which seems to be a part of the story). The community is a closeted bunch of fruitcakes ruled by gossip and prejudice. The movie paints a vivid picture of the community's weirdness, but how does that serve the point of the story?I don't get it.And the genre is a little weird. If its a courtroom drama, then hard evidence should rule the day. If it's about the ambiguous nature of good and evil and the hidden powers of fate and voodoo on our lives, then fate and consequence should rule the day. I don't think you can mix them. The court room drama and hard evidence is what takes up screen time and pulls our attention forward, but then the climax switches the focus to the good/evil ambiguity and the sense that you get what you deserve by divine retribution. So we go along for one ride (Courtroom Drama) and finish on a different ride at the end (Good/Evil Contemplation/Fate). Makes me feel weird about the ticket I purchased at the beginning.A specific example is the photographer took pictures of the crime scene and handed it to our protagonist. In a Courtroom Drama these types of actions should have consequences later (maybe he develops the film to find a clue). But it didn't happen. So the Genre is busted. We devoted a good portion of attention in the first half of the movie being sensitive to these clues in the story, but there is no payoff. So in the end we feel we have been duped and wrongly invested. One star for wasting my time.I think the Genre ambiguity might arise from the fact that this is a book adaptation. In the book medium, we can get inside the heads of the characters and try to make moral sense of the external actions. But it might not have translated so well in a movie.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca "},{"Title":"The Title Tells it All","Date":"25 August 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Lady Chablis absolutely upstaged the rest of a very interesting cast.

It was To Kill a Mockingbird meets Planet of the Apes meets Every Which Way but Loose, a combination of Classic, Cult, and Strange but in a fun way that John Cusak exploits as the observer who is enjoying the strange duality of the characters that he meets without embracing them and yet finds himself becoming part of their lives. The courtroom scenes were surprisingly realistic despite the constant presence of bizarre characters...yet beneath the bizarre is a tolerant reality...two different worlds co-existing and only rarely jarring together. This is a very unusual film, very, very different and hard to pigeonhole. It is memorable if just for that. The duality of Spacey's dripping charm character with a contempt and loathing for the very things he covets creates a conflict that is interesting to watch.

John is intrigued by the idiosyncrasies of the townsfolk but when Jim shoots and kills a young man later that night, he resolves to investigate the crime.This is the sort of well made, well acted, high quality movie I don't like. Its pedigree is too good - based on a highly acclaimed novel, made by an award-winning cast and crew, clocking in over 150 minutes and containing virtually no action. I guess there is an audience for such films, but it's not me. I'd drop most of the characters, halve the running time, put a car chase in the middle and have a shock twist at the end. Having said that, there is a lot to enjoy - all the performances are good, the best being Australian actor Thompson as Sonny, the good-natured but somewhat exasperated defence lawyer, and it's nice to see Eastwood's old buddy Lewis as the goofy head juror. The protagonist is interesting, as is often the case with stranger-in-a-strange land stories, and the voodoo priestess angle is amusing. In the end though, it's just much too long - the Lady Chablis drag act character has little connection to the case but has an hour of screen time - if I'd wanted to watch La Cage Aux Folles I would have just done so. Eastwood likes these people and their foibles, and is much more interested in exploring their lives than creating any kind of tension or suspense in what is primarily a crime story. Shot in beautiful locations in Savannah, and adapted from a bestselling novel by John Berendt, which was based on a real-life murder case.

It's distinctly one of those Read the book-type movies where the lovely storytelling got lost in the translation. In the book, there was much more of a story than in the movie &#150; the evocative descriptions lushly accented what was basically a courtroom drama. But perhaps it was too lengthy of a story to be told on film. The fact of the matter is that there really isn't that much of a story at all. While the colorful characters come alive on the page, in the movie, they camouflage a threadbare script. Perhaps it was just a poor choice for Eastwood's directorial abilities, or perhaps it was a poor choice for a screenplay &#150; there are many flaws that nag and distract throughout. What does not distract is the art direction, which is one of the stars of the film. The interiors and exteriors, in their natural setting of Savannah, are glimmering jewels (so lovingly created in the book), and they, too, help hide the unmentionable script problem. So lovely are they that one wishes to see more of them, and might be just as happy with a travelogue where all that messy plot stuff doesn't interfere. John Cusak is an amiable enough actor, playing the role of the reporter John Kelso, who is assigned by *Town & Country* magazine to cover one of Jim Williams' legendary Christmas parties. Right off the bat, the story's famous characters start making their appearances, and they are all well-cast. In fact, the entire movie is well-cast, with a minor exception of Jude Law who is a fish out of water as the rough trade bad-boy (and Williams' erstwhile lover), Billy Hanson. Law is talented, but was not rough enough looking for the small role, and never, ever approached believability as the hard-drinking, small-time drug-dealing boho Southern trade. The use of Savannah locals, sometimes playing themselves, is clever and entertaining. Lady Chablis, a local drag entertainer, has her moment in the sun playing herself &#150; a screamingly funny pre-op transsexual whose relation to the actual story is very slim. She does, however, manage to get a large share of screen time, including the funniest scene in the movie when she crashes the cotillion for black debutantes. Jack Thompson makes us utterly forget his Aussie background as he brilliantly recreates the role of attorney Sonny Seiler. The cleverest casting twist was using the *real* Sonny Seiler to play the judge. Irma P. Hall, as voodoo practitioner Minerva, makes the most of her role as the manager of the spirits of the dead, even if the role is one of the most troublesome, scriptwise, in the whole movie.

The city of hot nights and cold-blooded murder!Murder, mystery, and voodoo all rendezvous at Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil in Clint Eastwood's best film ever! Rarely do movies show so much of a true southern city they are depicting and get it right. What you see depicted in the picture is what you get in the beautiful city of Savannah. The people are so loving and caring its makes you not want to leave. That is one thing I love about Midnight because it shows you first hand how the people are.Kevin Spacey's performance is top notch. Though not compared to The Usual Suspects or American Beauty because he's playing a real character, you actually think he becomes Jim Williams. John Cusack and The Lady Chablis are also a big treat. Ms. Chablis needs to consider an acting career because her performance was amazing. The rest of the cast, Jack Thompson, Alison Eastwood, and Jude Law are all wonderful.I must say the Academy Awards really missed a real winner. I think everyone in the movie was outstanding and for all you people out there who love this movie as much as I do keep supporting the rising Savannah movies being shot there. I would have to say this is one of the best American films ever made! If you do like the movie I would also recommend Eve's Bayou or The Gift!

Having previously lived in Georgia for 10 years and being very familiar with the Savannah area, I had great expectations for this film.  In many ways it satisfies, yet in some it is much like giving a starving person a small scrap of Filet and declaring that they will be full.(May contain a few spoilers within text)While the film is based on the Jim Williams murder trials of a couple decades ago, it misses so much of what the book offers.  The book gives a better flavor of the city of Savannah and its unique charms and characters. It seems as if the opening scenes are all we get to see of the city in the film version.  So much of the focus is on the Jim Williams case that even some of the shots blur out the historical location.  Savannah is so rich in supernatural and historical folklore, that it seems an injustice to zoom in only on Jim Williams. They may as well have have filmed it in Augusta or Macon for what little we actually see.Kevin Spacey is outstanding in his approach to the Jim Williams character, sounding exactly like an upper-class old line Georgia man I once worked for.  Some of the others come off as the stereotypical shut ma mouth types you see in every southern film.  It is my feeling that Eastwood should have taken more advantage of some of the intriguing history Savannah holds in making this film.  Nevertheless, it is far better than many films I've seen made with southern cities as a backdrop.There is one classic line that William's lawyer delivers that DOES ring true as to how folks in Georgia cover their scandals. He describes a prominent local young man who mistakenly gets involved with the girlfriend of a mobster.  The young man is found with a certain part of his anatomy severed and placed in a decidedly humiliating pose.  The next day the paper read; ACCIDENTAL FALL FROM PORCH KILLS LOCAL YOUNG MAN!  Never does the movie come closer to hitting home.John Cusack to me still seems a bit more suited for the earlier lite-comedy roles he used to hold, but he ends up coming off adequately in MIDNITE.  The Lady Chablis IS entertaining and funny, but perhaps some of the footage devoted to her could have better spent on developing some other characters.  I must admit, though, that I loved seeing her bust up a haughty southern society party as she does in this film.This film is not bad, but more of the actual flavor of the city is what was needed to make it really come alive.  This could have been accomplished without turning it into a travelogue.  As it stands, I found it to be much like having low country boil (regional dish) without the spices.

I found that the 'Perry Mason' parts were where my attention span lapsed the few times that it did.  All of the rich characterization, the beautiful, lush southern scenery and wonderfully clever dialogue kept me entranced (minus the aforementioned parts) for the entire length of the film.  This is really why I watch films, movies like this.  John Cusack has a wonderful grasp of how to portray a 'yankee' in Savannah's court, so to speak.  He is savvy, and smart alecky while still seeming a little lost in this whole new world he has stumbled (or been pulled) into.  Kevin Spacey is, as always, the consummate professional actor, inseparable from his character.  His seemingly unshakeable demeanor, apparent ability to always be in control of the situation and slow southern style in this picture make the viewing believable as well as a pleasure.  The rest of the cast are as delightful as they are eccentric, making this a real treat to watch even if it IS around two and a half hours long.  I do not frequently watch the drama genre, but occasionally I will if I think that it will be worth my while to invest the time.  This film was.

The plot is quite slim so the story is filled out with quirky local (mostly real) characters that are unrelated to the case.

The same goes for a mysterious voodoo lady, a man who is surrounded by tethered horseflies, and another who walks a dog-less leash - all colorful, atmospheric characters, but so what? Ultimately we know nothing about the killer or the deceased and the trial is less important than the oh-so colorful denizens of Savannah's unique society.Kevin Spacey specializes in eccentric characters and here he's over the top, arrogant, and unlikable.

What a wonderful film this could have been about Savannah culture and society in general, and Mr. Williams in particular, as played out against the backdrop of the Georgia legal system.

It a movie that is only satisfying when viewed in it's entirety, so trying to get away halfway through is hapless folly. John Cusak does a great job as John Kelso, a writer who gets drawn inside of the periphery of a murder trial while visiting the home of Jim Williams, a wealthy businessman and socialite in Savannha Georgia. Williams is skillfully and convincingly played by Kevin Spacey.Kelso is there on business for a well known New York Publication and simply wishes to do a story on Williams, but befriends him in the process. When Williams is accused of Murdering his young male lover, Kelso leaps to his defense, believing him innocent of the crime. While the trial is going on and Williams is confined to jail, Kelso comes up with an integral piece of evidence that will get him acquitted.Kelso rushes to the jail to deliver the good news to Williams who confesses his guilt to Kelso before Kelso has the opportunity to tell him that he's come up with key evidence that assures his acquittal. Kelso is shaken to the core as he's now aware that his friend is guilty of the murder of the young victim. He nonetheless lets Williams know that he's come up with evidence that will get him off the hook and Williams again goes off to court and is found not guilty.Kelso is haunted by the fact that he not only assisted in getting a guilty man acquitted, but was also hoodwinked into believing he was innocent of the crime in the first place. He stops in to Williams house to say goodbye and when he departs, Williams goes to the window of his study to watch him as he walks away. At that moment, he's stricken by a heart attack and falls to the floor of his study. As he lies dying, the ghost of his slain young lover briefly appears on the carpet and watches him die. A brief smile of satisfaction crosses his face and lets the viewer know that he's pleased that, in the end, Williams has paid for his crime.There are heavy moments in the movie, as you'd expect to find in a murder drama, but Clint makes sure that you don't leave the theater in a depressed state by strategically placing humorous situations along the course of the film.

Intrigued, I went to see the film, only to discover, to my disappoint that the image I liked so much wasn't in the film. Still, I did enjoy the film quite a bit.Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is based on John Berendt's chronicles of his time in Savannah, Georgia. The story of the movie follows John Kelso (John Cusack), a young journalist who comes to Savannah to do a story on the annual Christmas party given by Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). John attends the party, and later discovers that Jim has been arrested for murdering his lover, Billy (Jude Law). Sensing a much more interesting story in the murder investigation, Kelso decides to cover it instead, and does some investigating of his own. Along the way, he meets several of Savannah's more colorful characters Sonny Seiler (Jack Thompson), Jim's lawyer, who seems more concerned about his pet bulldog, who happens to be the mascot for the University of Georgia, than he does about the trial; Minerva (Irma P. Hall), a spiritualist who communes with the dead to try to help Jim; Joe Odom (Paul Hipp), a pianist who gives parties in houses whose owners are away; Mandy Nichols (Alison Eastwood), a singer who sings at Joe's parties; Luther Driggers (Geoffrey Lewis), a local eccentric who keeps flies on leashes attached to his shirts, and threatens to poison the water supply; and Lady Chablis, playing herself, a flamboyant female impersonator. Mandy and Chablis help John out during his investigation, assisting him in obtaining a critical piece of evidence, assuring Williams' acquittal. However, before John can tell Jim what he has learned, Jim tells John something that causes him to wonder if Jim isn't guilty after all.The movie tells the story with considerably more charm than the book, which is downright condescending at times. By focusing on the murder trial, Eastwood creates the kind of tension that will nicely sustain a film. Along the way, he manages to present that which is unique to Savannah in a way that makes the viewer want to experience the real thing. He also manages to make Savannah seem like a friendly and welcoming place, so John's desire to move there makes a lot of sense.Overall, the acting was pretty good. Cusack does a fairly good job with John, although his reliance on a perpetually confused expression detracts from his performance. Spacey is charismatic as Jim, and draws the focus of every scene he's in. Thompson gives an amusing turn as the unconventional attorney. Lewis' Luther is well done. Alison Eastwood shows that she is indeed a talented actress, and gives Mandy a warmth that draws the viewer in. Hall's Miranda is wonderful. But the scene stealer of the movie is Lady Chablis, whose performance is wonderfully over the top.Savannah makes a wonderful setting for the story, and is presented with all its grandeur, as well as its seamier side. The contrast between the two mirrors the contrast between older and modern times.Overall, a most enjoyable movie, and a good mystery besides.

Viewers are given two views of a murder but it is obvious when Kevin Spacey confesses to John Cusack, the writer who is novelizing the incident, we believe him. Nonsense such as the guy walking the dog leash or the moron who appears in court with live horseflies strung to himself. The Buddhist elements serve no purpose and the conclusion is confusing. Director Clint Eastwood does major injustice with its methods of humour that often distracts. He has made mysteries with investigations before but nothing this morbid. He made the excellent Absolute Power earlier in the year, which was engaging and provocative but here he could very well have directed the worst film that this otherwise talented director has ever made. Cusack asks too many questions but never demands much of a response to the idiotic traits surrounding him. Spacey's role serves more as a prop than a vessel of meaning. Alison Eastwood and Irma P.

And one gets the distinct feeling he optioned the movie rights to this as either a vanity project or because he liked Johnny Mercer's music. But not from a love of the subject matter.Much of the southern Gothic potential is squandered, the sleepy mood intended instead becomes mere glacial pacing, and there is an all-round bored feeling coming from the camera, from Mr. Eastwood... Yes, there is a good cast, but nothing is done with them... Even the scene on which the title is based, the voodoo ritual in the graveyard, is as flat and uninspired as it could be.Clint seemed to ALMOST have the right idea, as the picture opens with a drifting, sailing shot over the marshes, fading into that statue in the moss-drenched Bonaventure cemetery --- all set to KD Lang's haunting version of a Mercer tune....But it's pretty much downhill from there.

Planted in the dense foliage of Georgia, a violent encounter soon sends Kelso on a trail of events to pry open the personal lives of these Cajun residents, and maybe even finding his story underneath it all.Whilst the film moves slow under its carefree southern veneer, the eccentric range of quirky characters, ranging from party-throwing squatters, a flirtatious transvestite, and best of all, a jive-talking voodoo practitioner, all provide entertaining and comedic encounters for Kelso.The film soon transitions to a courtroom drama that centers around the trial of millionaire Jim Williams, played by a moustachioed Kevin Spacey. He is able to pull of the accent convincingly, and that is all that is required in order for him to convince you as a southern artisocrat even as he spits out one-liners in supreme Spacey fashion. But there remains a hidden intention beneath his character's surface that he hints at all too well with the eyes.In fact, all the actors are in top form here, even a distracting Jude Law in a brief role. If it's anyone, it is John Cusack as the main character who perhaps leaves a bit more to be desired, along with his underdeveloped and tacked on love interest. Still, she is played well by Alison Eastwood, and together with Clint himself, they put together an atmospheric soundtrack that only adds to the immersion.Ill-paced and often confusing at times, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is still a worthwhile romp into the secrets of America's southern edge... one that at times feels like another planet.

For example, the real Sonny (the lawyer) plays the part of the judge in the movie. Jerry Spence (the hairdresser) plays himself, as does the Lady Chablis. The movie was also filmed almost entirely on location, so all of the buildings and homes you see are the real Savannah. The addition of the fictional John Kelso character also was a big help in connecting the actual events without it seeming like a documentary. I was also happy that he cut out the majority of the court trial time (in real life it went to trial multiple times), and the end scene with Billy's ghost was quite creepy.Overall I think this is a great film, and it's full of witty quotes (many provided by Chablis) and funny characters placed in a drama that manages to keep you interested.

Unfortunately for us, this wasn't it based on John Berendt's best selling true life tome, Midnight is a mildly engaging hotchpotch of disparate ideas - courtroom drama, small town expos and witchcraft-infected magicking - but a far cry from Eastwood's best.The action centres on Savannah, Georgia, an archetypal Southern community redolent with customs and mores belonging to a bygone age. Into this time-warped setting comes John Kelso (Cusack), a young New York hack sent by Town and Country magazine to cover the prestigious Christmas Party of Jim Williams (Spacey), antiques collector and distinguished citizen.Yet the post-party status quo is disrupted as Williams is arrested for the murder of his clandestine live-in lover Billy Hanson (Law, who once again is called upon to embody volatile youth).With a murder trial in his lap, Kelso is drawn into both the anachronistic milieu - It's Gone With The Wind on mescalin - and the veracity of Williams' self defence plea, deciding to stay on in Savannah to help investigate the case.Rejecting the powerhouse drive of a Grisham-style trial movie, Eastwood and screenscribe John Hancock overlay the will Williams walk free? dynamic with a mosaic depiction of the townsfolk. This approach results in sprawling, languid storytelling that spends far too long wallowing in the minutiae of Savannah's social strata. To compound the wayward structure, Eastwood's direction lacks the fizz to enliven the proceedings.Between the excesses there are pleasures to be had. Eastwood elicits a plethora of good performances - Spacey neatly adds to his pantheon of cultivated, slimy slicksters, Cusack lends his customary insouciant cool yet both are upstaged by The Lady Chablis as sassy transvestite Chablis Deveau who guides Kelso through the Savannah underworld. Moreover, the ambiguous nature of justice is intelligently handled and the outcome of the court verdict does keep you on tenderhooks. However, the lasting impression is that more momentum and less indulgence may have worked wonders.5/10 "},{"Title":"Midnight in the Garden of Lame and Misguided","Date":"4 March 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  First of all, this was an unfilmable book.

Remember A Chorus Line?   Chorus was also unfilmable.  THEN, Sir Richard Attenborough got the directing job  based on the fact that his last picture (Ghandi) was a hit.  Attenborough had no talent  whatsoever with this kind of material, and several directors who at least had a HISTORY  had already passed on the project.  Can anybody take a hint?  At about the same time  that Midnight was being filmed in Savannah, Georgia, The Gingerbread Man was also  being filmed there.  Gingerbread Man was being directed by Robert Altman.  What if  the two directors had just switched projects?  We can only imagine that the resulting  movies would probably have been a lot better. (The Gingerbread Man was a flop.)  The  point is, material has to be matched with temperament and sensibility.  As to some of  the performances in the picture, the actor who played Sonny Seiler (Jim Williams'  attorney) is an embarrassment, but the role was embarrassingly written. (The real Sonny  Seiler, who plays a judge in the picture, is a quadruple embarrassment.)  John Cusack  LOOKS embarrassed throughout the picture.

Every Tom, Dick and Harry critic uses adjectives like `impeccable' and `immaculate' to describe it, so I expected the film version to be at least something half-special.  What I didn't expect was a rudimentary courtroom thriller in the predictable, ho-hum John Grisham vein.  And for all the wild Savannah southern-carousing it's supposed to exemplify, it's hardly incisive or smutty.  In fact, it's less absorbing, but highly reminiscent of, the USA network's original series, The Big Easy (unless you've seen both, you have no idea how much that comparison hits the nail on the head).The story centers around a young New York writer, John Kelso (John Cusack), sent to Savannah on behalf of Town and Country to cover a prestigious Christmas event held by `gay' millionaire Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey), an antiques dealer, collector and restoration specialist who built his wealth through the reconstruction and sale of 18th and 19th century homes. Anyway, Kelso gets sucked into a good ole sequence of events and colorful characters after Williams is arrested for the murder of Billy Hanson (Jude Law), encountering the likes of The Lady Chablis, a sassy, shapely transvestite singer-performer, Minerva (Irma P. Hall), a voodoo priestess brought in by Williams to help bolster his defense in the Bonneventure cemetery.According to Berendt, Savannah is supposed to be a city of eccentrics, voodoo and dark, underlying secrets but for the most part Eastwood creates user-friendly kooks and oddballs - nothing edgy.  With a director like David Lynch or Sam Raimi, this film may have become a dank, enigma-fueled piece of the Southern Goth puzzle.  I mean, I expected weird when I read the premise of the story -- nothing is as unusual as what we've already envisioned. As a result, the lack of focus leads to a boring TV-movie epic (two-and-a-half hours) about Southern backdoor politics that ultimately brings the movie to a halt.   And no one, no matter what their crime, should have to watch this much of The Lady Chablis!!The best thing about the film is the visual symbolism of the Bird Lady statue in the cemetery.  Bowing, with a small saucer in each outstreched hand, she represents the scales of justice; the ying and the yang; the good and evil - a perfect, but devalued metaphor for what should have been. a sleepy-town tale of the hidden vices lurking beneath the surface.

The filmmakers make an unfortunate effort to truncate a lot of the book's events and introduce characters that either were on the periphery of the real action (the very odd Lady Chablis becomes a witness during the trial even though in real life she had nothing to do with it) or are altered for the film (Berendt--here known inexplicably as `John Kelso'--has a love interest, played by Eastwood's daughter Alison; the character she plays, Mandy Nichols, has no real romantic involvement with Berendt in the book); these decisions cause the film to lose credibility in their obviousness.

I was hoping for something similar regarding the movie, but was disappointed.  While the movie has it's points, Eastwood tries too much to condense a book that was probably better left alone.  Part of that is no doubt related to the book's literary success and the hopes that a movie would also be successful.  But by condensing the book, Eastwood ends up loosely stringing together the various characters and scenes and flies over the issues of race and wealth that the book more prominently displays. The movie also displays some cliches that are pure crap.  The longing looks through the window, Cusack's character finding love with the help of Minerva, and the walk in the park closing sequence are among these direction choices that demonstrate Eastwood's lack of maturity (as a director at least).  Anyway, read the book and enjoy the characters that the movie passes over.

I think that the colorful characters add warmth and humor and that they teach Cusak's character important lessons and are therefore an important part of the plot and not minor annoyances or sidetracks as some people have commented.  The people who found these characters annoying must have thought they were watching a thriller or a murder mystery with a linear did-he-or-didn't-he plot.  This movie is more than that.  We experience what the writer character experiences and see how it influences his behaviour and outlook.  This is not just a courtroom drama, it is a personal journey.

John Cusack's character's description of Savannah society operating as if it were 'Gone With The Wind' on mescaline and the fact that everyone was going about their business is very much what the South is about.  It's not the mescaline part, but the characters ability to act as if nothing is wrong is truly what the movie, and the South, is about. Only by having the South viewed by an outsider as if here were a wide-eyed child can anyone truly see how a good Southerner operates. To accuse Clint Eastwood of presenting a morality play is to miss the point of the movie.  I suggest anyone wanting to watch Midnight... should view Prince of Tides first.

Kevin Spacey is the focal point as Jim Williams although he has relatively little screen time compared to co-star John Cusack and Lady Chablis, a real person who, one suspects, is supposed to be larger than life but is actually just annoying. Spacey is interesting to watch, and nails a role that could so easily tip over into caricature in less able hands.He plays Jim Williams, a wealthy ever-so-slightly effete southern gentleman whose homosexuality is an open secret until he shoots hustler Billy Hanson (a hilariously miscast Jude Law) and faces trial for murder. We see Williams only through the eyes of John Kelso (Cusack), a New York journalist who originally visits Williams' home town of Savannah to cover one of his legendary parties but stays on to write a book about the trial. While this gives director Eastwood the opportunity to introduce the viewer to all relevant (and irrelevant) aspects of the people and social customs of this quaint southern town, it also prevents the film from giving Williams' character the in-depth scrutiny he deserves.The film meanders along at a leisurely pace that complements the lifestyles of the residents of Savannah, a place which seems to have never made it past the 40s or 50s. But while this should mean we really get to know the characters involved, we never really do. Instead we get a half-hearted romance between Kelso and a local songstress and a quite frankly daft sub-plot involving voodoo and ju-ju that is at odds with most other aspects of the film.For those who don't need their films to rush along at three seconds per scene this film will prove to be a fairly satisfying watch, even though the ending - which seems to go on forever - will probably prove unsatisfactory.

MIDNIGHT incorporates some of the more rich and compelling courtroom dialogue that serves to anchor the movie while swirling around it somewhat odd characters abound that unfortunately don't always seem to add a lot to the movie, just the quirkiness of it. The conflicted John Cusack in one of his more serious, dramatic roles gets to reveal his ability to stand with Kevin Spacey as an actor. There is a deliciously, edgy undertone through this movie, an ambiance of the rich Southern culture, yet sometimes the movie clichés seem to interrupt the flow of the movie. Nonetheless, the movie is multi-layered, textured with good character interplay, and brings to the screen a nice oddity that keeps this movie from descending into the moribund, ordinariness.

The film seems unsure of whether it wants to be a sophisticated courtroom drama or whether it wants its courtroom drama to not even be the main story at all.

Kevin Spacey's effusive charisma makes an interesting character that much more complex and the film is populated by interesting characters a drag queen who wants to use testifying in court as an opportunity to promote herself, or a guy who walks an imaginary dog. There's an interesting woman who walks into John Cusack's room at the beginning of the story but by film's end she just turns into a boring old love interest.

Throw in a mix of eccentric characters, voodoo and murder and we have a potential classic.What we end up with is a drawn out mess with a great movie in there somewhere. I agree completely with what an earlier reviewer said in that there's too much time wasted on incidental characters. Both Lady Chablis and Mandy Nichols are almost irrelevant to the murder investigation, but take up large chunks of screen time. At least Chablis is funny (I say team her up with Cusack and remake the lethal weapon movies) but the Mandy character was completely irrelevant.Then there's the plot. It could have been great. The mix of eccentric characters, unusual setting and cultural mixtures offered the chance to create something really original. The movie begins and I'm wondering who these people are, what secrets they hold and what is really going on. I suspect that all will be revealed and I wait expectantly.I wait and wait but nothing really happens. The story goes down the courtroom drama route, popping in for a bit of apparently irrelevant voodoo on the way and ends up feeling like a melodrama that doesn't know whether it's a comedy, a thriller or a mixture of the two. I was never sure, but I laughed more than I was thrilled, and I didn't laugh much.The acting is decidedly downbeat. Cusack is solid as always, but never brilliant. I'd like to see him play a different character from the intelligent but slightly hapless liberal. Spacey isn't great and Jude Law hardly in it at all. Nobody shines - it's all very mediocre.And yet I can't say I didn't enjoy it. I half suspect that with repeated viewings, something will be revealed to me that could make me more positive towards it. It's as if there's something there that I can't quite grasp. Maybe it's just that it has all the attributes of the type of movies I like, but hasn't the quality in any area to raise it up to the level of great.As an aside, is anyone else irritated by the constant use of overweight voodoo women who appear to be blind (but can see...oh yes...) and laugh knowingly to themselves?

I ranked it a 3 only because I reserve the lowest rating for enjoyably bad films like Plan 9 from Outer Space.   However, Midnight in the Garden was just a waste of time and not a film I would ever recommend.  I'm certainly not bothered by long or slow moving films provided that the story and characters are engaging.  Yet, this film did neither.  It is filled with caricatures and cliches so typical of Hollywood these days.  The film masquerades as a mystery, but we know from the beginning who fired the gun and why.  The mystery is as thin as the cardboard characters.  The film also injects totally extraneous comedy into the film, perhaps to please studio executives worried about the mass appeal of the film.  After 150 minutes of this I was hoping a large meteor would land on Savanna   Rather than waste your time on this film, I would instead suggest watching Una Pura formalità  (A Pure Formality) or Evidence of Blood which are far superior films of the same type.

When Clint Eastwood's film version opened, though, it was greeted indifferently by critics and audiences alike.  No wonder.  At 155 minutes, it crawls along like a snake, but it never rattles and doesn't bite.  Kevin Spacey is perfectly cast as Jim Williams, the Southern gentleman accused of murdering his male lover (Jude Law, very good in Gattaca), and the Lady Chablis, the drag queen, offers a good imitation of herself, but who needs John Cusack as a reporter, a stand-in for Berendt? The music is again credited to Lennie Neihaus, Eastwood's long-time composer, but since the bulk of the score is devoted to Johnny Mercer songs, what did Neihaus do?  (Considering that Eastwood wrote Claudia's Theme for Unforgiven and Doe Eyes, the theme for The Bridges of Madison County, what does Neihaus ever contribute to the score of Eastwood's films?) Perhaps the best song, Come Rain or Come Shine, is rendered instantly forgettable as warbled by Allison Eastwood (considering her complete lack of presence, nepotism, not talent, must be on her side).This failed film just may be an example of miscasting behind the camera. Good as Eastwood the director is, the eccentric Savannah, Georgia milieu of Midnight... just isn't his turf.  Then again, John Lee Hancock's dreary screenplay may have prevented any director from doing his best work.

Another indication of the failure of this movie is that we couldn't care less about the outcome of the movie and any of its characters. I was expecting better as this was directed by Clint Eastwood who also directed Absolute Power, which I liked. But this is terrible.

Geoffrey Lewis carries poison and horseflies, a man walks an imaginary dog,  Minerva casts voodoo spells, and even the prison inmates act like dogs.   Alison Eastwood is mesmerizing, and Kevin Spacey is always fascinating.   This made the film entertaining, but not memorable - much like a good  television show.  The plot doesn't much matter, you are watching the  people.  The big difference is most TV shows don't last two and half hours.

He has a way about him that makes women swoon. Every woman I know has fallen in love with him for this role. This character provided more insight into human behavior then imagined. He seems to know things about people (not just suit sizes) that are not obvious to others. Spacey brought eloquence and wisdom to this character. His character provided us with many unforgettable lines. John Cusack seems very real and truly impressed throughout the film. His facial expressions and the way he responds to all the craziness throughout is the most natural I've seen in a very long time. It's as if it wasn't a film at all but a hidden camera instead. The moral of the story...if you are seeking a voodoo queens assistance in anything do exactly as she says. Do not follow her instructions in part. The Lady Chablis performance was one of a kind to say the least. Her signature line in this movie has been used in my household several times.

MORE than once? I could barely sit through it the first time!Long, boring, with unecessary scenes and characters that do nothing for the story. I kept asking myself, when is something going to happen? Cusack is one of the only bright spots, but I thought Spacey was not convincing and Lady Chablis was comic relief only.Like some Beethoven symphonies, you keep thinking it's going to end, and it doesn't...yawn.Rating 3 "},{"Title":"Uninteresting plot and main characters overshadowed by incidental characters.","Date":"12 January 2000","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  This seemed a very weak story which was totally overshadowed by the bold incidental characters and events. The camera and the plot never seem to give their full attention to the story in hand, preferring to distract you with anecdotal tales and sidelined stories.Spacey hams it up big style and has that knowing attitude that he's perfected so well, he knows more than he'll tell, and he always will. Cusack is probably the stronger of the two characters and stands up very well against the overpowering competition in the form of Ms Chablis. This character is so interesting, she just steals every scene she's in, and the interaction between Cusack and her is brilliant to watch.The first fifteen minutes of this film make you wonder if you're going to want to stick with it (in fact I didn't on my first viewing) and the incidental characters seem to overshadow the actual storyline, which is quite weak anyway.

Although known for their acting ability, Kevin Spacey and John Cusack are about as liberal as they come. Combine that with a liberal Clint Eastwood as director, and you get a movie that is basically about tolerance of homosexuality. Not only that, but it goes one step further and attempts to normalize homosexuality. Spacey's character says its natural and just sex. Another major downfall of this movie was the fact that it had no really climax. I felt very unsatisfied and disturbed by this movie. I had hoped for a good drama and came away frustrated and empty. I was severely disappointed with this flick.

After an hour I should have stopped watching it. By a bad decision was made and I kept watching it. After two hours I eventually had the good sense to stop watching because nothing interesting had happened in those two hours. If only I'd given up on it sooner I could have spent the time better, perhaps ironing a shirt or cleaning the oven. The title sounded good and the cast was a good one so I expectations might have been raised, but even if I'd just beamed down from space and not known any of the actors my opinion would be no different. It was one of the worst films I've seen in a very long time, if not the worst. Some poor films have something redeeming, but I struggle to think of one for this film.

It's not a film that's easy to classify being in part a valentine to Savannah, in part a court-room drama and in part a wannabe mystery. Kevin Spacey is excellent but then when isn't he and John Cusack is only mildly irritating in what is, in fairness, a thankless role. If you like Southern accents and a small boy's idea of what the old South full of plantations and cotillions was like then you'll like this entry but I would have enjoyed it more had it been able to make up its mind just what it wanted to day.

My wife and I honestly think the average score on this movie is way too high. After watching this flick, I decided to finally write a review.I'm a huge Kevin Spacey and John Cusack fan. Kevin Spacey played a socialite and played the part perfect. Cusack's part was a writer who was very likable and believable.Their acting seems to be the only good think in the movie. Midnight in the Guarded started out with a well defined story path but then never went anywhere. And it dragged on and on and on and on....2 1/2 hours to be exact. This movie could of easily cut 45 minutes of useless scenes but it didn't.Being a movie buff I say don't waste your time unless you just want to watch the acting performance of Kevin Spacey.

It drags on and on unnecessarily.  I liked what Kevin tried to do but he couldn't save this one.  It was way overlong and has any number of scenes that could have been shortened or removed altogether.  If a film is two and a half hours long it had better need every minute, and this film wasn't even close.  The ending annoyed me and I ended up not liking most of the characters.  Alison Eastwood really impressed me as the love interest, but she was about the only reason to really see this movie, even if you're a Kevin Spacey fan as I am.  I give this film a C- and urge you not to see it if you have a short attention span or good taste. "}]
