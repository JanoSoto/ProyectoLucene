[{"Title":"A bumpy fairy tale, but buoyed by a great cast","Date":"29 June 2001","Score":"7 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Comedy","Review":" Ally Sheedy works very hard to convince us she's a spoiled rich girl who takes everyone for granted. I felt it was all a con, and therefore couldn't wait for her character to make that transformation into a Better Person. Sheedy wasn't necessarily miscast as she was misdirected; she naturally projects a very savvy, efficient persona, and acting childish is beneath her. The second part of the film, with Sheedy working as a maid to wealthy neurotics Dick Shawn and Valerie Perrine (both terrific), is more successful, and the fantasy elements of the plot have had time to grow on us and are more acceptable. There are still some clumsy or awkward moments here, however for the first time Michael Ontkean is a CHARMING Prince Charming (not just a substitute for one) and the supporting cast is made up of wily and likable characters. Maid to Order leaves you smiling and that means it has done a good job, though it takes at least thirty minutes to kick into gear. *** from **** "},{"Title":"Sweet and charming","Date":"3 October 2004","Score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Comedy","Review":"  Jessie is a spoiled rich kid who finally pushes her widowed father Charles too far. After her father wishes he never had a daughter, one day Jessie wakes up with nothing and is told by fairy godmother Stella she will have to make it on her own. The poor girl has no idea how to do that, and the results are predictable but hilarious. The only reason she can get a job the eccentric but loaded Starkeys want a white maid for a change, and they are amazingly patient. Stan is an agent who represents entertainers but has hit a slump; Georgette changes her hair style (and hair color) numerous times and finally gets it right. Their other servants are Audrey, a formerly popular black singer who had a drinking problem but had children to raise (she doesn't seem to be married), Maria from El Salvador, and klutzy chauffeur Nick. Eventually, Jessie learns her lesson, and the ending is formulaic but enjoyable. This is a movie that reminds all of us we should be nice to everyone, even the servants, and not be too proud to do the dirty jobs in life.Ally Sheedy was good most of the time. She started out spoiled but still easy to like, and ended up sweet. The one problem I had with her performance was when she begged for her old life back. Somehow that just didn't seem right. Even though her character was supposed to be a whiner, she just seemed too whiny. Overall, the good outweighed the bad by a large margin. Most of the other acting performances were really good. I especially liked Theodore Wilson as Charles' servant, maybe because I've seen him in so many roles going back to his days as the mailman on That's My Mama. And Tom Skerritt is always good. This was a pleasant movie with lessons to teach us, even though the theme has been repeated many times.

I like how this spoiled brat gets what she deserves, gets a taste of being treated like a nobody, and finally learns that life is about true friendship, family, and giving to others--not about being rich and buying friends. When I first watched it, I loved the comedy and the fun. Then, upon watching it again, it made me a better person. How? I was often jealous of rich and never-have-to-lift-a-finger people (like a doctor's daughter I know). After seeing this movie (and going beyond the I wish that would happen to so-and-so feelings), I finally realized how sad and lonely it would be for someone like that to have money (do they like me or my money) and to lose it (or constantly worry about losing it). Without the money, a person has to rely on social skills and everyday talents--things the main character (and some people we know) don't have. But finally realizing she has to do something to survive (and do it herself), this Maid to Order discovers the true riches of real friendship. We find a caring, generous person deep inside her (I wish all your wishes come true). Now that is what I call wealth. I'm trying hard to see that good person deep inside those who have no social skills. With all the money they have, they are still poor. Hopefully, they will learn their lessons before it is too late for them.

I don't know Alley, but I can believe she is more like Jessie after she reforms than before when she acted spoiled. Why? She didn't seem natural at being a spoiled brat.I however warn parents that have a nudity phobia when pertaining to kids. In one scene she goes skinny-dipping. Nothing can be seen while she is in the water, but when Nick refuses to return her clothes, she says fine jumps out of the pool and heads for her bedroom sans clothing. This scene shows her walking away nude, but only from behind, No frontal nudity in the scene, basically not much more that what a bikini covers except for the small portion of derrière the triangle of cloth a bikini provides. No biggie for most people, but some people do not like surprises.I on the other hand congratulate her for being able to do that scene. For some nudity if all but impossible because of self doubt or because society has made such a big deal over the human body, yet not a gratuitous sex scene. Though I have not clue why they showed her back side at all, she could have been show shoulder up getting out of the pool, then used bushed as she runs from the pool to hide her nudity.That said, I liked seeing that state of undress, she is beautiful.

Jessie is an irresponsible brat who lands herself in jail one night for reckless driving and drug possession, and her frustrated father wishes on a star that he had never had a daughter (which, in retrospect, seems pretty harsh).

Jessie is recognized by nobody; not even her own father. Her only companions now is a filthy party dress and a lady (Beverly D'Angelo) who calls herself Jessie's fairy godmother- she's actually the witch who granted Jessie's father's wish. Jessie is forced to take a job as a maid for a high-profile Beverly Hills music promoter and his wife (the late Dick Shawn and Valerie Perrine) and has to learn to love and respect people, as well as herself, all over again.I love Ally Sheedy in this role. She plays the part of the wealthy b*tch very well. You cannot help but feel sorry for her poor, soft-spoken father.

After taking a group of people dancing late one night, she is lectured by her father the next morning for charging over $900 on his credit card. Then, that night, she is pulled over for speeding and spends the night in jail for drug possession. While she sits in jail, her father wishes that he never had a daughter. Meanwhile, Stella (the fairy godmother, played by Beverly DeAngelo) appears in the jail and bails Jessie out. Stella explains that the charges were dropped, and that no criminal record exists for Jessie. But there's a shocking surprise for Jessie. Stella had cast a spell that caused Jessie to be broke, and with no family or friends. She doesn't believe it, and tries to go back to what was her home, but her father, chauffeur and maids act as though they never knew her. She meets with Stella again in the park, and is advised to get a job. Jessie ends up finding beat up high heeled shoes from a dumpster, and gets a job working as a maid for a snobby rich couple in a similar mansion. The couple have a very disgusting taste for clothes and not a lot of respect for Jessie. She meets a cook (played by Merry Clayton) and a Spanish speaking maid, and works with them (she also ends up meeting Nick, the mechanic, who also lives at the house). After a while, there's a party at the house, where Jessie's father and Stella are among the many guests. The people are asked what their wishes are, and Jessie wishes that their wishes come true. At the end of the movie, the spell is removed, and Jessie's father knows her again, as does the chauffeur. She also gets her original high heeled shoes back from the beginning of the movie and no longer has the ugly ones from the dumpster. Jessie and Stella say goodbye, with Stella driving away in a bubble toward the starry sky. Great movie, and I read that it is somewhat of a Cinderella-in-reverse story, that I agree with. This is also very 80s, because of the clothing, and the pastel colored blinds (gross!!), but I feel it has held up well over time.

When she gets arrested for drunk driving and drug possession, her dad decides that she's finally crossed the line and, beside himself with frustration and disappointment, he says something he never thought he'd hear himself say - he wished his daughter had never come into his life at all. The fairy godmother Stella (Bevelry D'Angelo) hears his wish and decides to grant it in the hope of teaching Jessie a lesson - she continues to exist, but to the outside world, i.e., her father, it's as though she were never born, which means she's on her own. Stranded with no money (except for some loose change), no family, no friends and no home, the hapless Jessie is forced to take a demeaning job as a maid for an eccentric rich couple. As she is forced to do real work for the first time in her life, it is here that she finally learns what work is, and learns the true meaning love, friendship and respect for one's self and others through the eventual friendships she develops with the other workers.Lightweight, mostly good natured coming of age fantasy fluff. Ally Sheedy, a fine actress who never got the recognition she deserved (though even she couldn't pull off some of those bad haircuts), plays her part well. Even as the spoiled rich bitch early on, you could tell that even she wasn't entirely happy with her life and you could see throughout the film that it genuinely hurt her to have her father not know her.

The caricatures of the rich people went a bit far, and weren't really very funny. And record company executives being enthused over a singer who does old Motown sound?
