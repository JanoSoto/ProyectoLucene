One must never take anything for granted.","Date":"14 March 2004","Score":"27 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  In the opening scenes of Baby Boom, set against a back drop of hustling and bustling women in the workplace, Linda Ellerbee provides us the following commentary  Sociologists say the new working woman is a phenomenon of our time.  Take J.C. Wyatt for example, graduated first in her class at Yale, got her M.B.A. at Harvard.  Has a corner office at the corner of Th and park.  She works 5 to 9, makes six figures a year and they call her the Tiger Lady.  Married to her job, she lives with an investment banker married to his.  They collect African Art, co-own their own co-op and have separate but equal IRA accounts.  One would take it for granted that a woman like this has it all.  One must never take anything for granted.And that my friends sets up Baby Boom in a manner far better than I could even begin to.  And why must one never take anything for granted?  Thought you'd never ask.  Just as J.C. Wyatt (Diane Keaton)is about to be made a partner in the company she works for, and a few hours before she is to have the most important business meeting of her career, J.C. is left an inheritance by some long forgotten relatives.  That inheritance turns out to be cute and charming Baby Elizabeth(Kristina and Michelle Kennedy), dumped on J.C. at the airport.  It seems since J.C. is the only known surviving relative, it is left to her to care for Elizabeth. Thus we end up with the first half of our fish out of water story and it's a dandy, thanks in large part once again to Miss Keaton's wonderful comedic timing, and the fact that we like and admire her character. In a formulaic comedy such as this, the value of that is inestimable. In the early going we know that much of what we see will be how well J.C. copes with being an executive while trying to raise an infant, a job she is totally unprepared for.  As for her investment banker Steven, whom she shares the co-op with, playing father is not his idea of a good time and he quickly makes his exit. This is J.C.'s and Elizabeth's story, so obviously he is not needed.  The film could have easily gone off course in the early going, making it strictly a comedy of slapstick, but thanks to a good script by Nancy Myers and Charles Shyer, it quickly steers away from that.  What we do see is J.C. not only quickly learning to care for her child, but also figuring out how to juggle motherhood and an executive position at the same time.  Of course nothing in the film world is easy and circumstances soon force J.C. and Elizabeth out of New York City to the snowy country side of Vermont, and we get our second fish out of water story.  It is here that J.C. meets Dr. Jeff Cooper (Sam Shepherd), the town veterinarian and a romantic interest for J.C.In order to move their film along at a nice clip, Meyers and Shyer, do take some licenses and shortcuts.  How J.C. obtains Baby Elizabeth is a little suspect, as is how quickly J.C. purchases a house in Vermont, just from a newspaper ad. In films of this nature there is nothing wrong with taking a few shortcuts if it helps to get from important point A to more important point B.  It's the same thing that happens later, as we see J.C. try to build a new business.  There is no doubt that in the real world, it doesn't quite work that way, but again, if this were a dramatic true life story, things like that might matter. For this lightweight comedy, it's just not important.  Another thing the director Charles Shyers does is make good use of the Kennedy twins as Baby Elizabeth.  In any film where a child is an important part of what is happening on screen many directors overplay the cuteness bits.  Shyers seems to know exactly when Elizabeth is important to what is happening in the scene and when she is not.  He never dwells or lingers too long on closeups of her, and he does not develop what I call the cute kid syndrome whereas the director overplays, overdoes, or rams a child actor down our throats when it's not needed.  Shyers knows this is Keaton's film, and never forgets that.  My hat's off to him.One could easily argue, as some have, that the Shyers have made a comedy about a women's place in the world.  Perhaps they have, but I don't agree.  At no point did I think they were telling us what women in general should or should not do with their careers.  What they are saying, is that all of us, women and men alike, should be able to make personal choices that have nothing to do with our careers and be able to do it without being penalized for it.  It's a philosophy I happen to agree with, and when I do that you get my grade, which for Baby Boom adds up to a B+.

Diane Keaton is one of the most engaging, likable actresses, in any role, and this one is perfect for her. The story doesn't hold a lot of suspense -- you know where it is going early-on, but that doesn't lessen the enjoyment. All of the supporting characters/actors, in both the sophisticated/big-city/New York setting, and in rural Vermont, are well-cast and likable as well. Keaton and co-star Sam Shepard are also engaging as a couple, with humorous contentions at first, and the romance soon following.The rapidity and degree of her success in her Vermont business venture are somewhat unbelievable (even despite her prestigious business background), but so what?Simply a thoroughly enjoyable, funny, pleasant and uplifting viewing.

This has to be the best movie like this for men. While it speaks to where women were in the corporate workforce in 1987 versus today, it also displays well the fact that it is the baby that causes Keaton's character to grow up, develop and become a more whole person than just the business tiger she was. The addition of Sam Sheppard as the veterinarian love-interest for Keaton is very well done. Sheppard appeals to men as a masculine, intelligent person willing to call his own shots when and where he wants. His ability to become valuable to Keaton who would have before seen him as valueless is priceless. This is a good snowy Sunday evening movie to go well with a good, hearty stew and a good friend.

After five years of less than satisfactory productions she scores a hit in this late '80s comedy.  Unfortunately, it also signals a trend towards more commercial and less artistically challenging pieces, but hey, a hit's a hit!

The first half of Baby Boom is dynamite, when Keaton has to deal with the frustrations of early motherhood and handle her job almost at the same time. The scene where she tries to put a diaper on the toddler is classic comedy. I was explosively laughing out loud at that scene. Another very funny moment is when Keaton interviews potenial nannies. Who would have ever thought that she would interview an Iranian woman for the position? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! The second half isn't quite as hilarious as the first. It does tend to sag just a tad bit, but that doesn't hurt the film. As a whole, Baby Boom is a terrific comedy that I thought was better than 3 Men and a Baby, which came out in theaters just after this one. 3 Men and a Baby was funny too, but Baby Boom is funnier.***1/2 (out of four)  "},{"Title":"Baby Boom","Date":"3 July 1999","Score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Sweeter than sugar Keaton is delightfully charming in this pleasant comedy about a high powered business executive who lives in her work, until she inherits a baby girl from distant relatives who have been killed.

It ruins nothing to say that the shrew ends up well and truly tamed. The most amusing aspect of the movie by far is the why in God's name am in this movie? look on Sam Shepard's face.

Spoilers ahead It is about JC Wiatt, a career woman, who was a tiger lady living with a boyfriend named Steve Buchner (Ramis) in an obviously loveless relationship. Then she finds out that her sister and brother-in law died in an auto accident, and she finds she was given an inheritance which much to her surprise, was her niece Elizabeth. She tries to raise the baby, but Buchner tells her it is me or Elizabeth, and her boss Fritz Curtis, essentially says you much choose between the job or Elizabeth, and she is being threatened by a younger co-worker Ken Arrenberg (Spader). She finally decides to give up Elizabeth for adoption, but changes her mind, when she feels guilty because the couple who was adopting, just wanted her to use her to work on a farm. She then packs up Elizabeth and moves to a farm in Vermont, where everything goes wrong, from the heating to the plumbing, but she sticks it out, and eventually meets Dr. Jeff Cooper (Sam Shepard), who will eventually become her love interest. She then creates a baby food for Elizabeth called Country Baby that becomes such a hit, that her old company and a rich investor (Pat Hingle) want to buy her out. She is going to take the offer, but just like when she chose to keep Elizabeth, she realized this was a mistake. As she pointed out to Curtis that I should not have to choose between a career and a family. no one should. And she took a look at Arrenberg, and said The rat race will have to do with one less rat. The point behind the film is about JC sacrificing everything she has for someone who really needed her (Elizabeth), instead of putting herself first, and being rewarded with not only Elizabeth, but a better relationship, more money, and the opportunity to be her boss, and not be around those who have no respect for her. The final scene of the film where JC returns to Vermont and Elizabeth says mama to her, and the smile on JC's face as she holds her says it all. 10/10 stars "},{"Title":"The taming of the Tiger Lady","Date":"10 May 2013","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Captivating comedy with Diane at her most disarming.

Because today's workplace environment is much more mom-friendly, this movie seems a bit outdated to women who were born after 1970. Many of them probably will not appreciate the plight of the main character, J.C. Wyatt (played by Diane Keaton) as much as we older women who worked through the 80's and beyond. But taken in this context, this movie is great entertainment.I particularly enjoy the problems she encounters with her new home in Vermont (reminiscent of Money Pit and Funny Farm) and also the relationship that develops between Diane Keaton's character the that of Sam Shepherd, the handsome country veterinarian. Some scenes are downright hilarious. Others, sweet and tender. Although I'd consider this a chick flick my husband enjoys it and I think many other men would like it too. The morale of the story seems to be do what makes you happy and not necessarily what society dictates.

And a lot of that has to do with realizing and setting priorities, because-- as a wise person once said-- You Can't Have It All.  It's the lesson we all learn in our own way in our own time, according to our own personal situation, and director Charles Shyer examines one of them in his amiable comedy, `Baby Boom,' starring Diane Keaton.	J.C. Wiatt (Keaton) is a high-powered businesswoman on the fast track to success; she knows what she wants, has set her priorities, and a partnership in the firm for which she works is on the horizon.  Her live-in significant other, Steven (Harold Ramis), is of a like mind-set, so they complement one another's life style perfectly.  Marriage and/or having children is in neither of their respective vocabularies.  then one day, J.C. `inherits' a baby, the child of a distant relative (a cousin she'd met only once) who has been killed in a tragic accident, and suddenly, J.C.'s world is turned upside down.  Keeping the baby is out of the question, of course.  Or is it?  For J.C., it just may not be as simple as it seems, initially.  She's been living life on her own terms, but now she is once again faced with choices, decisions and setting priorities.  And along the way, she learns one of life's most important lessons  The fact that the lesson never ends.	There's some amusing moments and some insights to be gleaned from Shyer's film, and overall it's a pleasant, enjoyable experience.  It is not, however, an entirely original idea, and Shyer laces it with stereotypes and cliches to boot.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, though.  If his characters are stereotypical, it's because they reflect a certain realism.  J.C.'s boss, Fritz Curtis (Sam Wanamaker), for instance, typifies the image of a dedicated, hard-core businessman whom you get the feeling has to consult his day planner to work in an appointment with his own family.  A stereotype?  Perhaps.  A reflection of reality?  Definitely.  The same can be said for Sam Shepard's character, Dr. Jeff Cooper, who personifies the general image of one in his situation.  And again, it is a reflection of reality, stereotypical though it may be.	Even the cliches are handled in a way that makes them fresh enough to work within the context of the story, and be appreciated-- especially by those in the audience who may have experienced any of the situations presented here.  When J.C. fumbles with a diaper and becomes frustrated with her own inexperience and incompetence with such things, it's cliche, but it also rings true-to-life.  The important thing is, it's all well presented and actually pretty funny stuff, even if it isn't anything new. 	Shyer wrote the screenplay, along with Nancy Meyers, and one angle they may have failed to cultivate fully has to do with Ken, the character played by James Spader.  As J.C.'s in-house adversary, also striving to climb the corporate ladder, it may have been intrinsically more interesting had the character been a woman.  The fact that Ken is a man, again, makes this particular situation fairly cliche; whereas a competitive conflict with another woman, considering J.C.'s predicament, would have expanded the avenues of possibility to a much greater extent, and certainly would have provided a more imaginative perspective.	The main reason the film works as well as it does, however, is because of the engaging performance by Diane Keaton.  In J.C., she creates the antithesis of Annie Hall, but even at her most demanding there is a hint of vulnerability in J.C., a softness to that hard exterior edge she uses to shoulder her way through the business world.  Keaton gives you a real sense of the conflict she's experiencing, and though it's lightheartedly rendered for the most part, you understand the underlying seriousness of it all.  And the scene in which she vents her frustrations and bares her soul to Dr. Cooper is classic.  Keaton's work is without question the highlight of the film, and what really brings it to life.	The supporting cast includes Pat Hingle (Hughes Larabee), Britt Leach (Verne), Kim Sebastian (Robin), Mary Gross) Charlotte, Patricia Estrin (Secretary)Victoria Jackson (Eve), Jane Elliot (Park Mom) and Linda Ellerbee (Narrator).  An upbeat, entertaining film, `Baby Boom' may not be particularly memorable, but it does provide some laughs, and at the same time says something about the value of being given the opportunity to question the things we `think' we want.  Kind of like saying `Never say never.'  After all, who can say with any certainty where destiny may lead any of us?  It's something a film like this may make you consider, inbetween the chuckles.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.

It seems unlikely that a woman of her calibre would have made such a big decision over the phone,having only seen a photo of the property in a magazine.The second thing was the ending.I mean, she's worked her butt off in two colleges,made a ton of money and a name for herself in the big city,is extremely successful and happy, and then one day a gorgeous little baby (that she doesn't want) is thrown into her life (and by the way,if all your family,apart from a long lost cousin that you had met once when you were like 7, had died and you were married with a baby,would you really send her off to the long lost cousin?And what about the mother's family?I suppose they're all dead too?Don't they have any friends either!?)So everything is perfect,but then her partner leaves her,she gets fired from her high-flying job and she has to leave town because she is so ashamed and can't raise the kid where she is.So she's basically,shorn by everyone,but somehow manages to start up a business making gourmet baby food.Now that's all great but here's the annoying part...she gets a call from her old boss,saying that a big company that shunned her before wants to buy her business and she is thrilled and gets straight on a plane to New York to meet with them.She sais things like; 'I'm back!' and lets out little yelps of enthusiasm when they offer her 3 million and a ton of money every year to stay on.She goes away to the bathroom and is delighted and then all of a sudden,out of the blue she goes back in and sais no and starts blethering on about some vet she's in love with.WAT!!!???This was her big chance to show em all!And the most irritating part is the fact that she has this look of triumph on her face,like she stuck to her principles and it was a victory for the little guy.But it wasn't!Had she taken the deal it would have been!Now she has a business she can do nothing with,a broken down old house in the middle of no-where and she's leaving New York a bigger loser than before!What is the point.Nevertheless,the babies are adorable and it is a very well written (most of the time) script and it's very funny.So I would recommend this one,but don't expect a victorious end!

(Pun intended.)","Date":"1 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" First of all, Diane Keaton is always worth watching, she can make even a lousy movie somewhat watchable. And she does her best with role as a workaholic yuppie who inherits an infant, but sadly, the movie starts to lag and the story becomes predictable. Baby Boom actually begins with some strong comic scenes, I especially liked her funny passionless relationship with Harold Ramis, but halfway through the laughs are gone, and the second half of the movie is almost entirely melodrama. Drama is fine, but melodrama is my term for slow and unsatisfying. The movie has a sweet message about making professional sacrifices for the sake of a family, but then again, not every woman needs a child to be happy. As others have pointed out, there are definitely some mixed messages here for career women.

I guess that's because I always associated here with Woody Allen movies...which I can't stand. So, this is actually the first movie starring a younger Diane Keaton that I have seen. And, she's really good here, as she has been in pretty much everything that I've seen her in (although that doesn't mean that I'm going to watch old Woody Allen movies!).And this film is very good...not great...but very good. It's about a career woman who has no time for marriage and no time for children...until a child is suddenly foisted upon her. She tries to give the baby up for adoption, but hasn't got the heart to follow through with it (especially when the adopting couple is a religious-not husband and wife from hicksville). So, she tries to balance motherhood and career, but that doesn't work and she ultimately quits her high pressure job and moves to snowy (very snowy) Vermont...to a disaster of a house...and boredom. Because she now owns an apple orchard, she begins making natural apple baby food, which catches on and grows her a huge business enterprise. Just as she has what she needs to move back to NYC, she realizes she has fallen in love with the local vet. Dilemma over. It's a cool script, with an occasional stereotypical situation, but it works.I wasn't so thrilled with the supporting cast, starting with Sam Shepard -- the vet. Please Sam, get your front teeth fixed; it's distracting. Well, pretty much too late now, but with a net worth of around $8 million, you could have taken care of that.Harold Ramis...well, don't get the attraction. He was satisfactory. Sam Wanamaker and Pat Hingle were fine as business types -- two dependable character actors. James Spader is along in a type-role he played often in his younger years -- a sort of snarky power grabber; he played it well and didn't over play it.But really, the movie rests on Diane Keaton, and she held it on her shoulders well. It's cute, but not sickeningly cute. A good balance with a point.

Harold Ramis is amusing as the initial bedmate. I also liked seeing former SNLer Mary Gross as her secretary and current member of the show at the time, Victoria Jackson, as the initial nanny. My favorite scene concerns Ms. Keaton's first encounter with Sam Shepard when she finds out he's a vet whom she just revealed her not having sex for a long time!

Her boyfriend Steven (Harold Ramis) can't take it and leaves. She moves out into the country. There he meets Dr. Jeff Cooper (Sam Shepard).While it had a few funny moments, this is all very cliché. Diane Keaton acts like an idiot around a kid. The kid playing around with the spaghetti was very cute. And it was scary how Keaton lugged her around like a sack of potatoes. But it also gets very hammy like when Keaton has to use a thermometer on the baby. The jokes go over the line time after time from funny to stupid. She's a grown woman, not an idiot. Just when things start to look silly, they hit you with the adoption melodrama. It's tear jerker at its best, and its most manipulative. And that's how I feel about this movie. It jerks you around from one contrivance after another. Sometimes it works. Sometime it doesn't. It just drove me nuts to see a possibly good movie with a perfectly funny actress fall flat on its face again and again.

Then one day, J.C. gets her inheritance from a cousin which she thinks is a pin but is actually a baby named Elizabeth and she is the only living relative to care for the adorable baby. Keaton's Wiatt is already uptight with the thought of motherhood dropped on her doorstep. She takes Elizabeth in and says goodbye to her boyfriend. She becomes the unlikeliest of mothers. The supporting cast features the wonderful American actor and the man who helped rebuild the Globe Theater in London, Sam Wanamaker CBE as her boss who is the work addict himself and doesn't know how many grandchildren that he has but his wife does; James Spader plays the man who would take over Wiatt's job after three years of training under her belt; it must suck to be a woman so Wiatt quits New York City and buys 63 acre farm in Vermont. There with Elizabeth, they embark on a new life where she makes apple sauce and starts her own business like Martha Stewart. Does she find love and happiness in Vermont with all the troubles of running her estate? You'll just have to watch and find out.

Diane Keaton is absolutely priceless here as the corporate executive whose life changes forever when she inherits a baby. Sam Shepherd is appealing as always, portraying her love interest.The tale revolves around a workaholic, yuppie corporate New York City executive, JC Wiatt, who learns that she has received an inheritance from a distant relative. Anticipating money, she is flabbergasted that this inheritance turns out to be a baby, little Elizabeth, and JC is her only known relative. This unexpected motherhood turns both JC's personal and business life upside-down. Her live in lover, Steven, is an investment banker and wants no part of child rearing. Also, she must endeavour to juggle child care with her high powered executive job. After losing a big assignment, she eventually abandons the corporate big city world and heads to Vermont for a country life. There she begins a home business by marketing applesauce and develops a new romantic involvement with the local town vet, Dr. Jeff Cooper.Diane Keaton pulls off some pretty funny scenes here, even if it's just the old stereotypical awkward incompetence at learning to diaper. She plays these scenes brilliantly; I believe it's her best role. The movie also portrays the cutthroat business world and the empty gap in JC's life when it consists only of career plus the relatively detached relationship with the banker. It also portrays her bonding & attachment to this little tyke, cleverly revealed when she tries to give up the baby for adoption, and explores exactly what sacrifices this woman is prepared to make in order to care for the child. True, as some reviewers claim, it's all the working women stereotypes, but it's a touching & fun movie, nevertheless.

And when her boss reassigns her to a less stressful client account and she quits in a huff, we're supposed to think he's a loathsome corporate shark and she's a gutsy role model. I didn't feel that way. From the moment Diane Keaton's character inherits the baby she acts like an idiot while the people around her are sensible and tolerant. This makes it very hard to root for her when her life is turned upside down, and even harder to believe in her as a high powered businesswoman. This character, as written and played, couldn't find her feet with a flashlight. I'm a fan of Diane Keaton but this script does her no favours and her performance is an insult to working women, working mothers and to the concepts of common sense and perspective. And yes, I know it's meant to be a comedy but it does also have pretensions to making social statements and seems to be setting Keaton's character up as a role model, so the audience deserves a lot more.

Soon the working woman has other obligations, which doesn't sit too well in the business world so she's forced out into the country. It's easy to see why this comedy became such a hit and continues to gather new fans each and every year. After all, you have some funny moments, a great performance by Keaton and you've got a cute child making cute faces. The word cute is the best thing to call this film because the screenplay is rather predictable and always goes for the obvious joke but this can be overlooked simply because of how great Keaton is. I think this film is the perfect example of something not being able to work had it not been for the actor in charge. If you take Keaton out of this movie then you've got absolutely nothing because the actress is just so convincing in the part that you can't help but love her. Keaton perfectly nails the working woman she plays early on as that toughness is something you'd never question. The actress has made a career of playing strong women so it shouldn't come as any shock that she handles the part here. She's also extremely funny with her comic timing and especially the stuff early on with getting used to the baby but also later in the film as she begins to crack in the country. The supporting players are also strong with Sam Shepard playing a kind-hearted country vet, Harold Ramis as a jerk who doesn't like kids and we even get vet Pat Hingle in a nice role. A young James Spader also appears playing what he plays best and that's a snake in the grass. Charles Shyer's direction handles the material quite well and he certainly keeps the movie going at a nice pace. I think the biggest problem is the actual screenplay, which hits every single note that you'd expect it too and the ending is just something you'll see coming from a mile away. BABY BOOM is certainly flawed but Keaton's performance is so great that she makes the film worth viewing.

More than 53% of the work force in the U.S. nowadays are women. There was time when women had to dress like men just to go to school (Yentl). In  the last fifty years there have been radical changes in the role of women in our society. They decided to become doctors and lawyers themselves instead of just marrying them. Women have become so independent like J.C. that all she cared about was her job. Two extremes!  JC. Wiatt  finds herself losing her job because she is too distracted with the baby. This movie raises really important issues such as men and women are equal but different. This movie explores the differences.  J.C. is able to find a proper balance as she buys a house in beautiful Vermont, and starts her own home business. It happened by accident!  She is compulsive,  and with nothing to do she starts piking apples like crazy. All the cabinets in the huge house are full apple sauce.

The film is about a woman who does not have any children receiving an unexpected inheritance as she becomes the guardian of a little baby girl. She has problems adjusting to this and this is where the film is at its best, though the best laugh for my money is the scene where the young toddler introduces herself to the boyfriend played by Harold Ramis. The woman wrestles with the idea of putting this child up for adoption, but she meets some people wanting to adopt the child and quickly reconsiders. Cannot say I blame her, as the wife and husband look like a couple who are going to inflict the child with both emotional and physical abuse. Seriously, the way the acted during that meeting the welfare agent present should have said no way. Well the fact she does not give the child up for adoption makes the boyfriend move out and on. Sure, most may think he is a prick for doing so, but it was his choice, having a child was not for him and he went with the way he felt rather than live in misery and transferring said misery to both the woman and the child and then things would have ended in a worse way. Well after a while the woman ends up moving to the country and there are a few more laughs to be had as she has to now adjust living in the country, but the film soon becomes to long as she is in a new romance and she starts a new business. There are laughs in this one, but it is just to long. Comedies that run nearly two hours usually end up being devoid of laughs in to many patches and this one was no exception.

Her only drive is work. And her boss likes it that way, a woman with limited outside interests, giving her the ultimatum work or life. That may seem more significant if she was engaged in an important job like say, a public interest lawyer or something. But Keaton's character, J.C. Watts, just works in advertising. Ironically, when it comes to domestic lines, the business brain of Watts just can't seem to develop ad campaigns for that which she knows nothing about...well, not yet.On a whim, Watts learns of the death of some distant, unknown relative, which named her the surviving guardian of a baby named Elizabeth (played, as always, by twins). So Watts is faced with a new responsibility. Hell, if she can master the corporate world, how hard can the mommy life be? Hard enough. And for Watts, probably more difficult than most, as she tries balancing her beloved work life with that of her newfound family life. Unfortunately, she can't keep up with the former, at least not to the extent of the twelve hour day, seventy-two hour week (or whatever the narration said) that she used to do prior to Elizabeth's arrival, and this starts to concern her boss, who makes the sleazy bachelor newcomer (with no anatomical or domestic to hinder performance) Ken Arrenberg (James Spader) her replacement.Well, Watts, gradually becoming close to Elizabeth, spends the next half of the movie embracing the excesses of mom first and working mom second as she and Elizabeth chuck the city and move to a Vermont country home, where she comes up with some baby food recipe that turns out to be quite successful. So successful, that she once again becomes the envy of her former employers, and puts her in a very powerful bargaining position which makes her wonder, is J.C. Watts willing to go all the way for her job again? Aren't women allowed some balance between work life and family life that would still enable them to be just as successful as their male coworkers? Unfortunately, in trying to illustrate the idea of a working woman's independence, they get a little too dreamy in the idea of family life over other opportunities.It's a nice film, too, that explores the cut-throat corporate world and the issues that working women are confronted with, despite the fact that it gets a little too cutesy at points. It also forces people to ask how far are they willing to go just for the simple pleasures of making money? Watts spent all of her time at work, and even without a family, she hardly had a normal relationship with her equally corporate boyfriend. It was so awkward and detached. But, when she moved out to Vermont and started giving more attention to the things that mattered (i.e. Elizabeth), her manner of relationship changed, having a real relationship with the local vet.It's something like in that Ron Howard movie, 'Gung Ho,' where Gedde Wantabe's Japanese character learns from his American employees that the Japanese work ethic of what is good for the company ignores things that are more important to a person's life such as family and friends. He notes that the water cooler conversations don't go much beyond whatever situation arises at work. The quiet Japanese man that worked at the plant at the end, happily, but briskly, injects into the conversation that his wife had a baby girl. Something he did not know of him before, but was happy to have made a breakthrough and hear something other than anything related to the company. Well, Baby Boom makes these same points, which seemed particularly more important in the Age of Yuppies, the decade of corporate furor.

Oh, please. I was watching the movie with my mother, and we predicted every move they did and we were right. I felt empty inside at the last half hour or whatever. It was WAY WAY WAAAY TOOO PREDICTABLE! Let me sum this up for you... *Contains 'spoilers'- though we all knew what would happen from the start*Business woman given baby... Business woman can't handle baby...Business woman grows attached to baby and spoils baby... Business woman is fired... Businesswoman-no-more moves houses Housewoman makes baby food....Everyone loves baby food and pays more than it's worth.... Housewoman makes lots of miracle baby food and gets millions (May I just stop here and make a remark- or a few. It's not like she just invented baby food- there are so many other brands of baby food. Does she not get any competition? Downfalls? No. It's unrealistic. More so than a miracle. This p****ed me off, to be honest.) .... Housewoman meets Mr Right and plays hard to get.... Mr Right and Housewoman fall in love and live happily ever after. Oh, and Mrs Millionaire has an offer to buy the business for more than it's worth but says no for no reason.Don't watch this. It wasted an hour and something of my life I will never get back. I'm still angry at myself for watching it. Clichéd and way too Hollywood and predictable, I hated it.The 2/10 is for that piece at the start which was bearable "},{"Title":"You've come a long way, baby","Date":"7 February 2009","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I had read about this film long before I ever saw it. Susan Faludi slated it in her book Backlash for being anti-feminist. Perhaps naively, I pretty much took her word for it.I eventually got around to seeing it because James Spader has a small role in it (during the devious blonde yuppy phase of his career - he really seems to have it in for yuppies). I was amazed by how completely I disagreed with Faludi.JC (Diane Keaton) is a very determined, resourceful woman. I am not sure how likely it is that she would be able to expand her business without sacrificing her quality time with her adopted daughter and new boyfriend, but I think she'll give it a good try. In my opinion, it is the career-obsessed men who are missing out.This film is saying that women can successfully combine a career and a private life. It may be corny and unrealistic (especially the method by which JC acquires baby Elizabeth), but Ms Keaton's character triumphs over adversity.In my opinion, that makes it a feminist film.

Somebody hands the kid to you at the airport and gets back on a plane? Somehow I don't think it really works that way. The movie loses all it's momentum at that moment and delves into cliche-city. Since there's no way in hell that this upwardly mobile career woman would have taken the kid except in the absurd fashion that it was thrust upon her the rest of the movie simply doesn't work. "},{"Title":"Split Personality","Date":"2 July 2006","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" The construction is rather obvious; the corporate wonder woman has a burden placed on her, but she is compelled to keep it. The second half mirrors the first half exactly - a boom of 'babies'.This could have been something more than a trifle, considering how the jokes were so fundamental to the way Hollywood currently makes fun of the flyover states. Note that the rejected nannies are servile, pious robots. The same idea of 'unacceptable risk' would be recycled in Mrs. Doubtfire.The first half is pure screwball in nature. The second half seems to have nothing to do with the tone of the first half at all. The writer/director gambled on using Funny Farm ideas, but tried to disguise them as something new -- it was no use, Hill's movie vastly overpowers this -- this comes across as indecisive and disconnected.The 80s seem to be the decade most lampooned in movies because of the unique confluence of styles -- linebacker shoulder pads on women's outfits, bass drum beats that would knock you sideways, businesslike sex, conspicuous consumption...Hollywood never seemed to realize, never seemed to have a clue, that every joke they fired off only made fun of themselves.It shows here the tinsel town airheads try to make fun of corporate America, but the way the movie itself was made is every bit as disingenuous and venal as the target.
