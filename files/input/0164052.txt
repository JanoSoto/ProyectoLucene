[{"Title":"Hollow plot and characters but visually fantastic","Date":"14 November 2003","Score":"59 out of 70 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Sebastian Caine and his team have worked tirelessly to develop a formula that can not only turn animals invisible but also bring them back to normal at will.  With Governmental pressure on them to show results, Sebastian decides he will be the first human to try the formula.  He becomes invisible for a short time, however efforts to bring him back fail and he finds himself stuck.  As work continues on the formula, the others in the lab begin to notice him becoming increasingly unhinged.From director Verhoven the norm is to expect great special effects and violence.  He has also been known to integrate themes and good stories into these mainly effects driven films.  On this occasion however he fails to really do that and is left with a fast paced and enjoyable film that makes up in effects what it lacks in substance.  The plot is pretty basic and never goes deeper &#150; Sebastian's descent into madness is not really a descent so much as a short trip that is not really built to so much as just delivered.  In it's placed though, the effects are really impressive and make the film worth seeing simply because, not only are they great, but they are also used very well in the action rather than just being the film in themselves.The cast is OK but don't really have much to work with in terms of material.  Bacon is much more interesting when not on screen than when he is.  His character is too thin and he fails to portray any sort of `descent' in his character's behaviour.  Shue is pretty good and seems to enjoy running round with a flamethrower.  The rest of the cast are OK but basically just act as fodder in the way that a normal slasher movie will have actors to be disposed of as the film rolls.Overall I really enjoyed this film as it is a very expensive special effects movie which relies on spectacle to keep things moving.  The effects are great and take the mind away from the lack of real substance and the action at the end is very enjoyable.  A really good special effects movie as long as you don't expect anything more.

Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, they ran out of ideas and decided to just kill everyone off and have it end in huge explosions, demonstrating a total lack of creativity. Too bad. It could have been great, were it not for the total lack of good acting, the one-dimensional characters, the corny lines and the general lack of anything worthwhile in the movie at all, other than good special effects. I feel bad for Paul Verhoeven; he used to make great movies; RoboCop, Basic Instinct & Starship Troopers were all way better than this mainstream garbage. The only good thing about this movie is the special effects, and, believe me, they are good. They are just not good enough to distract the viewer from all the negative points about the movie. It's really too bad that they couldn't make a better movie about invisibility; we've never had a truly good movie dealing with the rush of power it would be to be invisible. This movie tries, but it just falls short. All those great special effects, and no good movie to back them up. I'd only recommend this to special effect nerds, people who'll watch a movie regardless of quality just to see good special effects. I can't imagine anyone else actually enjoying this movie. I gave it a 6/10, but only because of the special effects.

In the late 90s, there have been a resurgence of these films, such as the Scream movies, which started off good and then went sharply downhill with each additional sequel, Urban Legend, and I Know What You Did Last Summer (as well as, God willing, it's only sequel, I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago). Hollow Man is a film that takes a fantastic premise and reduces it to yet another of these cheap imitation slasher films. Sure, the whole invisible man thing has been done before. Done to death, if you include literary examples. But let's face it, the possibility of human invisibility is one of the most fascinating premises that you can possibly tell a story about. The unfortunate thing about Hollow Man was that no one involved with the making of the movie seemed to realize that. What you have here is the development of an invisibility serum (as well as a reversing visibility serum) by a brilliant scientist, who successfully uses it on a gorilla in some of the best special effects scenes to date, and then uses it on himself. Well, of course he uses it on himself, what scientist could possibly resist? And why would any scientist WANT to resist? Well, the reason may be that, evidently, invisibility serum turns even the most intelligent scientists into raving madmen. The absolutely infinite amount of possibilities for an invisible character are completely ignored here in favor of turning him into yet another bland faceless killer. This time, we may know who it is that's trying to kill people, but what we don't know is why he completely ignores the outside world. This is the greatest scientific discovery of mankind, and this bonehead decides to use it to become a peeping tom and to spy on his girlfriend. This vast and hugely unfortunate simplification of the potential for the story of an invisible man is both bitterly disappointing and more than a little insulting. As Roger Ebert mentions in his review of Hollow Man, it seems that director Paul Verhoeven, who directed such great films as RoboCop and Total Recall, seems to think that his audience is so intellectually dim that they prefer a mindless killer to the incredibly imaginative villain (or protagonist) that Dr. Sebastian Caine could have become. Hollow Man is an absolutely fascinating display of brilliant special effects, which seem to map out internal anatomy just as good as any medical textbook, and is also a great deal of fun as the visible characters desperately try to make Dr. Caine visible again, but it is a dismal failure on the story level. The film starts out with a gigantic amount of intelligence, both that required for the development of an invisibility serum and that involved in the brilliant premise of the story, but winds up in the end as nothing more than yet another mindless thriller, completely lacking in thought and intrigue.

Frustrated and drunk with power, he turns psychotic in the classic H.G. Wells tradition.This is a gleefully horrible Invisible Man story, delivered with relish by the ever-tasteful Verhoeven and Bacon as the genius-turned-loonytoon-maniac. As with much of Verhoeven's work it has a terrific unrestrained sense of Boy's-Own comic-book adventure (the secret underground lab where the scientists work is just wonderful) combined with the most horrific and depraved visuals (women in their underwear being groped and attacked by an invisible fiend, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two reels). Whilst the story doesn't ring any new twists on an old idea, the CG special effects by Scott E. Anderson are eye-poppingly brilliant as we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones and flesh all literally appear out of nowhere. In particular, a sequence where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where Bacon drowns Devane in a swimming pool, are absolutely breathtaking in the detail and artistic invention of the effects. The film also has a great soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and classic horror-movie photography by Jost Vacano. The young cast are pretty much overshadowed by the movie's technical pedigree, but both Shue and Dickens are impressively out of their depth. This is a great fun nasty movie.

True, HOLLOW MAN is a remake of sorts of THE INVISIBLE MAN, but that's where the similarities end. HOLLOW MAN is an entertaining movie,period. If you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible, then you shouldn't watch movies in the first place. True, some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable, but HOLLOW MAN manages to entertain and make you think what YOU would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends. Kevin Bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who, along with a team of collaborators, discover the way to make animals invisible. Now his mission is to make them visible again. When this team of young scientists (working, as you might guess, for the Pentagon)think they have the formula for making animals visible again, Kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug. After that, of course, things go wrong, as Kevin Bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask, so his collaborators know where he is. Feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over Kevin's character, and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend AND collaborator (Elisabeth Shue) is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team, he finally snaps. The movie then turns into a hybrid of ALIEN and a slasher flick, but that's not saying it's a bad turn. There are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace. The special effects are top notch (a quality always prevalent in ALL of Paul Verhoeven's films)as we get to see some body reconstitution sequences never seen on a movie before. If there's anything to complain about, perhaps, is the predictability of the situations herein; by the first hour of the movie you KNOW Kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end. And the ending is a bit abrupt, but despite this, HOLLOW MAN is still worth watching. If you want to know what a TRULY bad movie is, then waste your money on FEAR DOT COM (With Stephen Dorf) or the even worse THE UNTOLD (or Sasquatsh, with Land Henriksen).

Visually, it is quite appealing and effective, and the soundtrack (especially the opening themes played over some effective and atmospheric opening credits) does a great job of adding some oomph to the action of screen. Keven Bacon is his usual on-screen self, and carries the film effectively, which is no small feat when consider that half the time he is either invisible or covered up in latex, which deprives him of most of an actor's most effective tools (his eyes and his mouth).In the scenes where he is covered in bandages, he has to get the character's emotions and presence out with body language and vocal cues, and even this is filtered through SFX. So I give him kudos for a professional, effective job in a difficult environment. So why only a score of 5 out of 10? Having admitted that the film is enjoyable if you don't think too critically about it, I am now going to think critically about it for a minute. Problem number one is Elizabeth Shue. Don't get me wrong, I think she is a very attractive woman, and she can hold her own as an actress in most movies. But she is horribly miscast here as a top level research scientist (just as she was in The Saint). She may come across as more than a typical dumb blonde, but she's a clothes-horse, pure and simple, and I can't believe for a moment that she could get a PhD in the physical sciences. She's far more believable fending off Bacon's advances than she is playing Pentagon Barbie. (The other two supporting actresses, who are by no means ugly or haggard, but still have considerably less Vogue cover potential, are quite believable in their roles). Problem number two is a certain weakness in the script regarding how and why Bacon's character goes around the bend. The movie implies and foreshadows all kinds of reasons Bacon is already a creep with a God-complex; the serum which turns him invisible is affecting his brain's neurochemistry; being invisible confers addictive power and opportunity he doesn't want to give up; invisibility creates an alienation and isolation from society...etc. But the script doesn't really drive any of these points home, and just flits from idea to idea without doing real justice to any of them. A line of dialog or two is meant to imply a whole series of attitudes and moral values changing, (It's easier to sin when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror, etc.), and even a pro like Bacon can't manage it in the space he is given. Problem number three is (are) the escalating misogyny and graphic completeness of the voyeurism, molestation, and finally rape scenes included in the movie to convince the viewer that the Hollow Man is becoming a human monster. The first two scenes were bad enough (especially the CGI of a sleeping woman's bare breast being fondled), but perhaps necessary, but the final full blown rape scene was way too mean and misogynistic for my sensibilities. That scene didn't need to be there, and its inclusion makes it hard for me to recommend it to my more conservative friends...they would be angry at me if they watched this on my say-so and came upon these scenes unprepared, and they wouldn't buy or rent this movie if they knew these scenes were in it. Problem number four is that the movie producers overreached themselves a bit with the invisible SFX...some of them, especially the transformation scenes, don't quite work. The figure struggling on the table is very plastic and inorganic-looking and doesn't convince. (Ironically, the first transformation scene, with the gorilla, works much better, possibly because our human eyes aren't as familiar with the textures and shapes of the simian physique). And here and there the articulation of the shoulders isn't quite right, or the swing of the hips. These deficiencies seem to be a common problem for 3D computer graphics of the human form, and they dog the animators here. Sometimes the animators get it, but sometimes they don't. I know it wasn't easy, but if they couldn't pull it off, they shouldn't have used it. The last major problem was that the movie should have ended when Shue does her wonderful base-stealing slide into the elevator and hoses Bacon's character down with her home made flame thrower. That was a great moment, and should have been the climactic payoff for the film. Instead the movie staggered on for another 10-15 minutes in Friday the 13th territory with the Hollow Man popping back up from what should be mortal injuries again and again - who knew that naked invisible men could be so resilient? So that's why only 5 out of 10. Too many problems and weakness to score this as a classic. But I do own this movie (bought it used) on VHS, and will buy it (used) on DVD if I find it cheap enough. Enjoy the eye candy and strong supporting performances and the many nice little touches here and there...if you are into that sort of thing.

Seeing the film again, I had the exact same feeling.  Hollow Man is a film of great potential, packed with terrific special effects and a surprisingly engaging cast (the exceptions being Josh Brolin and Elisabeth Shue).  So when the movie goes to cliche hell in its final 1/3, you'll be very disappointed even though the action is still entertaining.Kevin Bacon stars as Sebastian Caine, a scientist working with a diverse crew in an underground laboratory on a military project.  The goal to achieve the power of invisibility, as well as the ability to return to a visible state.  Caine, being the egotistical hothead that he is, performs the procedure on himself, but finds he is unable to return to his human state.  With Caine growing further and further mad, the rest of the crew try to find a way to revert him back to his normal state, not knowing Caine is beginning to prefer his invisibility and will do anything to keep it.The first half-hour of Hollow Man is the best, when we're introduced to these wow-inducing, eye-popping visual effects.  This is also the point where the story holds the most potential, before devolving into B-grade land.  Now, most people seem to agree that the film would have worked a lot better if it had focused on Bacon brandishing his invisibility on the outside world, and there is a ten-minute segment where he does do this, but it's also arguably the film's worst part.The reason?  That's easy, it's because he rapes Rhona Mitra.  Apparently, director Paul Verhoeven seemed very satisfied with just presenting this rape, as if though to make a statement about man's human nature and what we'd do if we didn't have to face up to the consequences.  That's fine and all, I'm for a little depth here and there, but it disturbs me that he doesn't address Mitra's character further.  Here's a woman who's been raped by an invisible man, and we're simply supposed to accept this scene and not wonder about the effect this will have on her psychological state (think about it this way, unless the military goes public with all the invisibility stuff, there's no way she wouldn't know if she'd be attacked again).  This is where the movie truly goes awry.The last half-hour is essentially Caine going around, knocking off all the lab workers, and while it's uninspired material, it's still rather exciting to watch, if only because Verhoeven is a skilled action director who really knows how to make us squirm and cringe at the sight of blood and guts.  But by the time it's all over, though I found myself mildly entertained, there was still a bad taste in my mouth from the filmmakers' poor decision-making and routine route they chose for the film.

Withholding information from his superiors, Caine tests his serum on himself and undergoes a  transformation that is quite visually arresting.  It's like an anatomy book come to life.   But  while Caine's transformation and subsequent experiments with his new found power prove  interesting, the movie fails to capture what it feels like to truly be invisible.  Caine says to his  colleagues, You have know idea how much fun this is.   In truth, we don't.  We see Caine slowly  going mad and trapping his fellow scientists in the lab when they threaten to go public.  But, we  don't get any sense of power from Caine.  True he does venture out into public and enters the  apartment of his very fetching neighbor, but that's about all the real world we see with Caine.   It would've been interesting to see Caine in the real world, and what would've been done to  capture him.  Instead, we have Bacon, Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin and a few others mixing it  up in a hidden lab somewhere in D.C.  While the actors try to make the best with what they  have, Paul Verhoeven tries to goose us a little.  He succeeds in a few instances, and he does  manage to hold your attention for a while, but the ending is the weakest link in the movie.

On reappraisal this film is far better than any action movie delivered by Hollywood since September 11th 2001.Kevin Bacon is a huge talent and his performance is excellent given the limitations of the script and SFX process. Elisabeth Shue is also extremely engaging. The problem lies in the script. What needed to be explored more fully is the use of such an extreme talent. The guy is invisible. So what can he get up too? All he achieves is the molestation of the beautiful Rhonda Mitra. Kevin Bacon is portraying an eccentric genius. Can he not think of something more inventive than rape? The direction is pretty pedestrian for Paul Verhoven considering his remarkable talent in this field. Hollow Man is a continuation of Paul Verhoven's love affair with Special Effects. Unfortunately the SFX appear stagy and unsubtle. Some effects are very well done but not all of them.The best effect is a simple one and proves Verhoven as a master of the medium. Kevin Bacon leaves a celebratory dinner but we do not see him leave. Elisabeth Shue turns and is confronted with an empty chair. This simple device works remarkably well because it is rather creepy and unexpected. More moments of such simple imagination and ingenuity needed to be introduced into the proceedings rather that the complete reliance on computer effects. Less is more, as they say.

The audience thinks steal banks, steal cars, wreak havoc on the town, pull down the presidents pants on national TV (Well, at least that's what I would do), but Paul Verhoeven only thinks spying on woman getting changed. This notion is recycled the whole duration of the film.2. Paul Verhoeven has the chance to get creative with the plot. He does bring up some OK thoughts, like the way Sebastian can't close his eyelids, or the way the characters throw liquid on him to make him appear visible, but he barely ever ventures out of the lab, and it isn't as scary when the characters have heat-vision goggles to spot where he is.3. The whole 'You stole my woman!' plot became really boring after a while. I mean, if you were invisible, you wouldn't spend your time grieving about some guy stealing your girlfriend! You'd be living it up!4. That damned ending! That ending is the reason I am beginning to hate Hollywood. It was like a really bad slasher movie, but worse.

When large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller, its clear that the film is hopeless.Not only that, it was sick too. The director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film, and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked B-movie. It's difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts. Perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke's mind if made invisible, but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, it hardly makes entertaining cinema.spoilers followGet past the films sick exterior, and things are even worse. Whilst Kevin Bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man', the rest of them  - perhaps handicapped by a dire script - do an even better job of being hollow cast. One long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man, He's finally snapped shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion. This is par for the course, and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting. They pad their way through the lab corridors terrified, guns poised, but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague. The lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts, even after he drowns the Pentagon chief, He drowned in his pool last night reports the same female, spectacularly failing to put two and two together.The script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an A-Z of film cliches, which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end.The 'eureka' moment at the computer, the female undressing at the window, the looped security video - the list really is endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices, the almost-dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman, the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer, the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes, the falling lift which just stops before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy.The invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame-thrower, electrocuted, whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors, and then having apparently survived the explosion, fireball and total destruction of the labs, has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes - by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches.That this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one, which should be avoided at all costs.

Go ahead, take a look at the film, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first true special effects movie. Come 2000, computer aided special effects seem like child's play, audiences are not blown away by special effects, instead they are disappointed if they are not done right. The special effects in Hollow Man, the update of the HG Wells story, are OK, but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven, who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation (yeah, I know that's not a word) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team's funding. So, as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation (yeah, I know, I used that non-word again) process. The process has dire consequences, no Caine does not die, but instead becomes a horny, violent creature, aka a guy. Now that he's invisible, Caine stalks a sexy neighbor, a co-worker, former girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue), and the man who took away his funding. Then a funny thing happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural being, The Thing That Won't Die. Laughing in the face of all things natural, Caine faces down death and spits in it's face, as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die, dragging the ending of the movie out. The movie is silly, stupid, and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man, but of course, not one of them is explored. For a more interesting look at an invisible being, get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema, and check out the 1933 Invisible Man. Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back, probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano.

That comment stands out in my mind the most, because it sums up the movie all on its own.All in all, the movie was boring, the outstanding special effects it had only lasted about five minutes, the script was pure cheese, the movie was stricken with a cliche epidemic, and the only horror about it is that a movie this bad was produced.

Josh Brolin is restrained and believable as a research scientist. The plot went along smoothly, with many cringe worthy moments. High production values, great special effects. Incredible special effects. There were some flaws, however. First off, why are all the scientists thirty-something? They don't hire middle aged scientists anymore? When Sebastian runs amok, there are too many instances where a little more thought should have gone into it. Naturally, the first one killed off is the black girl. Then, Bacon's character seems indestructible. He gets set on fire with a flame thrower. After extended moments of him writhing while engulfed in fire, the flames suddenly go out and he's none the worse for wear. He bashes people with a crowbar, inflicting huge gashes, but when he's hit by it, he's only momentarily stunned. The others never close the deal when he's vulnerable and let him recover to fight some more. Josh Brolin receives a horrific gash to his abdomen; like an unclosed appendectomy. He inexplicably stops bleeding and goes on to perform strenuous gymnastics in the elevator shaft with not so much as a wince. The lack of believability in the final climax nearly ruined the movie.

A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. Every premise for a great movie was accomplished. Unfortunately these things didn't matter at all. The movie was very very week, without suspense and awfully predictable. It's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility. After the tests on animals succeeded, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. Once he's invisible, he changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. From this to murder there's a very thin line.Hollow Man is an ill movie. It suffers of the disease that many new movies have the special effects. From a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects, without giving a damn about the real value of the movie. I must admit, the fx are awesome, probably the best i have seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie good. Actually that's the problem with the movies today. Just like Verhoeven, most directors care only about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot.After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again. In stead of a great film, HM is cr*p. There are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie 1. the special effects 2. the joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (i won't spoil this moment for you...)Okay, so what went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let's see what i can remember.--- It's not tensed at all. It should've been, but it's not.--- It's too predictable . You know from the beginning who will die and who will live.--- In stead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven cares only about the effects.--- Very many cliches. --- Of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying.--- Just like in every low quality horror, the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible. Every time there is somebody alone in the lab, perfect victim for Bacon.--- Some holes in the plot. Example at the beginning, Bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab. After he's invisible, how can he do that?--- The ending absolutely horrible.--- After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon falls down to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is that normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, they kill him again. And then Shue screams I heard an explosion (happened minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. Didn't she hear that explosion some time before?--- There's a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors. Come on, Mr Verhoeven , i expected much more from you!So that's about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam.

You know it's just after Christmas, I saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable TV & worst of all I feel sick, not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop I've had over the past week so I'll keep this one brief. The script by Andrew W. Marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original The Invisible Man (1933) film which Hollow Man obviously owes a fair bit. It manages to have a petty successful blend of horror, sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. I thought the character's were OK, I thought some of the ideas in the film were good although I think it's generally known that Verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety, the first thing he has the invisible Caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has Caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that Caine says to himself. Then of course there's the gore, he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits, to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it. Having said that I love horror/gore/exploitation films so Hollow Man delivers for me, it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.Director Verhoeven does a great job, or should that be the special effects boys make him look good. The special effects in Hollow Man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless, their brilliant & it's as simple & straight forward as that. There's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top. I love the effect where Kevin Bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins, organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the Gorilla. There's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten, someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results.With a staggering budget of about $95,000,000 Hollow Man is technically faultless, I can imagine the interviews on the DVD where some special effects boffin says they mapped Bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they? The acting was OK, Bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy.Hollow Man is one of hose big budget Hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film, well I know I do. Good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual Hollywood product, definitely worth a watch.

After successfully turning himself invisible, he harasses and haunts his co-workers in their secluded underground lab. The crew, fed up with his shenanigans, seeks to find a cure but that only brings the monster out in him, turning things from bad to worse.Verhoeven's time-waster is heavy on special effects but light on characters and originality. Bacon chews the scenery as the arrogant scientist on the fritz, while co-stars Josh Brolin and Elisabeth Shue seem like they belong in a better film. Verhoeven does the best he can with an anemic script, but eventually the special effects take over and the film becomes a bloated b-flick with a budget. There are at least a few genuine thrills to be found, and the film carries such a mean-streak and perverted air about it that it at least never gets dull. Unfortunately, like many of the director's latter-day films, Hollow Man takes things a bit too far and the end result is a sloppy, botched experiment, much like Bacon's science project.While there are certainly worse sci-fi flicks to be found, Hollow Man is an example of great potential failing to live up to expectations. In this film, you have a solid cast and a director who knows how to entertain within the science-fiction and action realms. There are redeeming qualities to be found, but they are few and far between. For lack of a better term, Hollow Man is pretty hollow.

I also need to say something else before I go to the negative side. Kevin Bacon is the best actor in this film. He did a fantastic job with his role. He made you feel how angry he was for not being able to be visible, but he uses his invisibility to his advantage, especially when he decides to kill everyone off so he can live a normal life without no one ever knowing about what happened. Now, here is the negative, this film's plot is below average. It just seemed to take a predictable turn when Sebastian decides to kill everyone. I wish they would have done something different, or maybe even draw out the process of him becoming crazy just to make it more creepy to watch. Also, after watching this film recently I noticed another bad part of this movie, Elisabeth Shue. She is awful, and I mean awful in this movie! She was great in the 80s, but you can tell that she has lost her touch with this one. Every time an argument happens in this movie, she goes hey guys let's just go and celebrate!

G. Well's The Invisible Man, Kevin Bacon plays scientist Sebastian Caine, who inadvisably tests his top-secret 'invisibility' serum on himself, and becomes a deranged homicidal maniac. Caine, a genius with something of a God complex, is a little flaky BEFORE he undergoes the experiment, but, afterwards, with the serum seriously affecting his mind, any semblance of sanity flies right out of the window as he makes the most of his new power by raping and killing at will.There is a big clue to the condition of Sebastian's fragile mental state at the beginning of the movie as he taps away at his PC, trying to solve a scientific problem, the word 'unstable' appears on the screen, before cutting to a close-up shot of his face. And this, being a typically OTT Verhoeven FX-fest, is about as subtle as the film gets&#151;which is fine by me 'cos I love the Dutch deviant's more flamboyant style mucho gore, minimal plot, sexy gals and GREAT BIG special effects sequences that blow your socks off. Hollow Man has all of this and much more.From the opening scene, in which a rat in a cage is graphically chomped in half by an unseen creature, it is clear that this one is going to be one hell of a ride. Verhoeven and his effects team pull out all of the stops to astound the audience with scene after scene of show-stopping CGI enhanced visuals and bloody mayhem. Whether it be the amazing 'disppearing/reappearing' FX, the pool-side attack on a surprised William Devane, or the tense finalé in which Caine hunts his scientist colleagues trapped in an underground lab, your gob will be well and truly smacked!Although there are plenty of silly moments which defy logic (in typical horror fashion, the scientists decide to split up to find Caine, who by the end of the movie seems almost superhuman and impervious to harm), the sheer verve and audacity of the film means you'll be having too much fun to care.Ending with a tense and action packed climax, which see the movie's survivors (sexy Elisabeth Shue and stock hunk Josh Brolin) ascending a lift shaft rocked by a huge explosion and chased by the kill-crazy Caine, Hollow Man isn't exactly demanding on the old grey matter, but if what you're after is a fun slice of excessive popcorn cinema, then this one is for you!

The movie starts off formulaic but interesting; it seems nothing intrigues like the idea of invisibility.  What would you do if you could make yourself completely invisible?  Apparently, the creators of this film would ogle women, fondle women, rape women, and then kill women.  Coming from Paul Verhoeven (Showgirls, Basic Instinct), this is starting to look like a pattern to me.  Any unsolved sexual attacks in Verhoeven's neighborhood lately?The last half of this movie then descends into bad acting, bad writing, and very bad science.  Besides what you see on the goofs page, here's a few highlights* After locking everyone into a freezer, Cane turns the temperature all the way down, and the temperature drops about thirty degrees in three or four seconds.  WRONG!* In said locker, Shue dithers around for a while, then makes an electromagnet out of a cardiac crash cart _while frost is forming everywhere_!

Look at me -- I'm a scientist!  Definitely one of the humor highlights of the film.* The boyfriend has the hook end of a crowbar buried into his stomach, but is able to survive when perky scientist Shue duct-tapes the wound closed.  (How's that for your typical male fantasy?  A sexy girlfriend with a genius IQ who likes duct tape.  If only she had brought the beer.)  A few minutes later, the boyfriend is able to hang from a ladder and pull Shue up to him with this tremendous tear in his abdominal muscles.* Shue sets a fire under one sprinkler head and all of them open up and spew water all over a metal floor.  Sprinkler heads are individually activated.  This would only set ONE head off.

They never look excited when they are supposed to be... never look scared when they are in great danger... never look like they wanted to be a part of this film when their agents said they should be.   They ended up just doing the film... where's my paycheck?The special effects weren't even that special.  Now,  I'm not one to go to the theatre simply for the sake of special effects.   A film should have a good story and the special effects should be used as a tool rather than the other way around.  But this film didn't have either a good story or special effects.  The effects were pretty tame by today's standards and looked fake at times, such as when Invisible Bacon had something stain his body (like... is that supposed to be water?) .  The thing I commend, in terms of effects,  is Kevin Bacon having to put up with wearing some of the effects suits he had to wear.  That must have been a chore to deal with.The only good thing I can say about HOLLOW MAN is that it wasn't director Paul Verhoeven's worst movie.  Their were actually some moments of enjoyment in this picture that I never saw in SHOWGIRLS.  But, I could see through all the director's tricks like I could see through his lead character.HOLLOW MAN was just that... hollow.  The film was as transparent as the title character.  And I only wish I could see the money I paid for this film reappear in my wallet.

But before proper testing can be done Caine impatiently pushes forward with experimenting on a human and volunteers himself as the guinea pig. The experiment appears to work and Caine becomes an invisible man, savoring his newfound ability and using it in inappropriate ways. But when the procedure to make him visible again fails, Caine's mind starts to experience side effects that make him violent and dangerous.Essentially an updated version of the Invisible Man story. Not surprisingly, since this is directed by Paul Verhoeven, there is a lot of focus on the sexual aspect of a man becoming invisible. Particularly that he uses his new situation to become a super pervert and rapist. Pretty much every woman in the cast is molested or worse. While the movie doesn't condone these actions, it is obvious that this is the part of the story that fascinates Verhoeven the most. It's kind of icky and exploitative. Kevin Bacon gives a particularly sleazy performance as Caine. Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, and Kim Dickens are all fine but none of the characters in this are written as relatable or likable. Rhona Mitra has a bit part as Caine's neighbor and victim. I don't believe she had any lines and appeared to have been cast just for how nice her breasts are.Despite the disturbing elements, it's a watchable movie of its type. The special effects are decent given the time in which this was made when CGI was still often spotty. Honestly the most impressive effects aren't that different from the impressive effects of older Invisible Man movies. The second half is probably better than the first. It's essentially 'slasher 101' with Caine going after his colleagues. Yes, it's predictable, but it's well-done and somewhat exciting. Could've done without Jerry Goldsmith's obtrusive generic score, though.

Loosely based on a 1897 H.G. Wells novel, both films are black comedies revolving around maverick scientists who develop a means of eliminating the absorption and reflection of light.In Whale's film our scientist is Jack Griffin, a poor, struggling chemist who already feels invisible, marginalised and ignored by both the scientific and wider social community. As a means of acquiring fame and visibility Griffin invents, somewhat ironically, an invisibility formula, but these wants elude him because he's accidentally rendered invisible by his very own chemical cocktail. Griffin then spends much of the film resentful of his wealthy and aristocratic employers - characters presented sympathetically by Wells' but villainously by Whale - a state of mind the film's economically disadvantaged depression era audiences themselves shared. Griffin's impotency is their impotency, Griffin's invisibility is their invisibility, and by the time a pushed-too-far Griffin makes good on his threats to kill his employers, nobody bats an eyelid. Back in 1933, audience's loved it.Whale directed a number of horror films for Universal Studios which, along with some of his subsequent films (The Man In The Iron Mask), later became regarded by scholars as veiled allegories for the director's own covert homosexuality. Early horror monsters are often read as being representative of certain anxieties toward (homo or hetero) sexuality - predatory, amoral, perverse, possessive of secret powers, and threatening to normal life - but your typical Whale hero is a social outcast who is depicted in a sympathetic light, tormented because his true self must remain invisible beneath a fictional public persona. Where Verhoeven's films delight in exhibitionism, excess and sweet release, Whale's hinge on repression; the return of the repressed. Incidentally, both directors were prisoners of war, Verhoven's country occupied during WW2, Whale captured by the Germans during WW1. Whale would commit suicide in 1957 (no fish jokes), drowning himself in a swimming pool.As with most of Whale's films during the 1930s, Man makes impeccable use of early special effects and oozes a sense of dank, Gothic creepiness. Ever creepier is Whale's handling of Griffin, who is initially shot at low angles to highlight his poignant aspirations, but suffers a complete mental breakdown by the film's end, becoming a looming, embittered monster.While Whale's scientist was smug and covetous, he was nevertheless courtly and well behaved around his love interest. Verhoeven's scientist, however, demonstrates no positive attributes whatsoever. And where both Whale and Wells ignore the erotic fantasies and more primal impulses of their hero, Verhoeven has his invisible scientist, Doctor Sebastian Caine, do nothing but indulge in depravities. Depravities Verhoeven extends to the US military, which itself craves total freedom of action and total freedom from accountability. Indeed, no sooner has Caine been freed from the shackles of civilization does he use his invisibility to murder, rape and torture. Note that each of Caine's devilish deeds springs from his desires being thwarted or his romantic advances being shut down. But the acts he commits aren't only about sex and satiation, but power, control and violence. By the film's end he's become a figure of unbounded power; egoic fascism writ large.Verhoeven's films try to work as genre critiques. Robocop and Recall gave us Western media, movie-going and entertainment as barbaric, mindless tourism. Showgirls gave us America as an all encompassing whorehouse in which aspirations are commensurate with exploitation, and Troopers gave us the United States as a blood-thirsty fascist frat party. Man does a similar thing, beginning with an invisible cat mauling a mouse and then a media commentator speaking of cats and birds, a game of predator and prey which Verhoeven contemptuously extends to his audience, whom he views as a band of mongrels bred to leer and chortle over torn meat.But Verhoeven's films often trade in exactly that which they purport to satirise. Here's the sex, titillation and barbarity you crave, they say, now look how idiotic you are for liking such an obviously idiotic film. The pleasure of Verhoeven, then, is in audience and film sharing a moment of gleeful, shameless idiocy. It's a kind of meta-arousal, where you're allowed to indulge because the work objects to itself. In this way Man plays like a less pretentious version of Haneke's Funny Games, or a less successful version of Hitchcock's Rear Window and De Palma's Body Double, other trashy thrillers about voyeurism, invisible, disembodied viewers, decontextualized sex and violence, and the urges, wants, roles, fantasies and responsibilities of audiences.Of course today virtually all films are meta-aware of their own stupidity. Post ideological, postmodern irony is the aesthetic of our time, audience's and film's shielding themselves in a passive irony (as opposed to critical irony, the role of satire) whose only function is a kind of disassociation. Zizek calls this the commodification of a strategy that once provided a legitimate means of challenge, Peter Sloterdijk calls this the negation of the negation, Toby Young calls it a critique that no longer has an object, that exists solely and absurdly as an assertion of superiority over all conditions of representation, Timothy Bewes an aesthetic that now mistakes its own absence for universalised vigour. In another, more immediate way, modern irony, satire and cynicism (every artist from Zack Synder to Lady Gaga is now a satirist) provide modern audiences with the freedom to reconcile consumption with consciousness. This contemporary sort of satire remains silent when it comes to social or ethical goals; it no longer stands for values but has become a mode of thought which defines itself in purely materialistic terms.7.5/10 - Now plays like trashy, camp comedy. Worth one viewing.

Let me tell you, it is rocking the roof off! Can you hear it? Oh, man, it's dope. You hear the 3/4 beat blasting the roof off?No, you probably can't.What if I told you that the song and the stereo system are magically INAUDIBLE. You can't hear the song even though it's actually playing through the speakers. Wouldn't that make things overly confusing? My point is that I've never understood how a movie about invisibility could work, much less do well. I don't think the concept has much potential, and I've always felt this way since seeing clips of the old black and white Invisible Man make footprints in the snow. Do you remember Disney's Pete's Dragon (1977) and how the thugs were hoisted into the air by a supposed invisible dragon? The movie was a classic for many other reasons, but if the dragon had never become visible to the audience, it would have made kids cry out of disappointment.I had always been suspicious of HOLLOW MAN for this reason specifically. I don't see how film can do invisibility justice. But after finding out that it was PAUL VERHOVEN'S Hollow Man, I quickly put it at the top of my to-see list.Without a doubt the most memorable scenes of HOLLOW MAN take place within the first half hour. First, an invisible gorilla is strapped to the operating table, and is brought back to visibility by an injected serum. The way the invisible gorilla writhes and screams in pain is enough to make an impact by itself, but we are treated to a meticulous CGI rendering of its anatomy. The skeleton becomes visible, then its organs, and eventually its musculature. The process is repeated with Kevin Bacon on the operating table, and the transformation from visible to invisible man is astounding. The top-notch CGI coupled with the screaming and kicking make for a scene that can stand among the best of its genre.But while these transformation sequences make quite an impression, the rest of the movie can pretty much be thrown away for two reasons(1) The movie gets claustrophobic in a bad way, since the rest of the movie takes place mainly in an underground lab. The Invisible Bacon whines about not being let outside, where he could exercise his new powers, and I commiserate with him. The movie would have done itself a big favor by including scenes in public places, a supermarket for example, where the invisible man could wreak havoc on innocent bystanders. Instead the drama is pushed forward underground entirely by the clashes between Bacon and the other five members of his scientific team. Limiting the action to an underground lab severely shrinks the scale of the movie and wastes whatever potential the invisible concept had to begin with.PLUS(2) Kevin Bacon's sudden jump from ambitious scientist to crazed madman needs more explanation. Josh Brolin tells Elizabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon is a genius; he can go from A directly to D. I can't do that. I need the B and C. Hey, me too. I need the B and C, too. Why does the happy-go-lucky doctor turn into a homicidal maniac? I see why the movie needs to turn Bacon into a lunatic. After all, where else would you get the dead bodies? But aside from the pretext of cabin fever, we never see WHY Bacon goes nuts. The invisible man's insanity and subsequent irrational behavior rings hollow in the absence of character development.If Verhoven had fleshed out (1) and (2), the movie would have been a lot better. Instead what you get is a shiny laboratory where the protagonist AND villain are non-existent. The suspense and drama are pushed forward by strange gripes among the characters that come out of nowhere. To make matters worse, the extra DVD features reveal how much work went behind creating the bulk of effects. The special effects team went to great lengths making the invisible Bacon appear in smoke, under a sprinkler, and underwater. If you ask me, it just looked like wisps of smoke and water. I can do that in my back yard! To achieve these effects, the crew had to paint Kevin Bacon either entirely black, fluorescent green, or dark blue with the matching contacts, all three of which were definitely cooler than the resulting invisibility. In my mind that stands as the biggest waste of time by a Hollywood production team I've ever seen.But what else would you expect from a paradox like See the Invisible Man!Oh, but Elizabeth Shue looks good in anything she does.JYJimboduck-dot-com "}{"Title":"Very poor reworking of The Invisible Man","Date":"13 November 2003","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  This has such potential - as did the original.

I heard a lot of bad things about it, enough to keep me from seeing it in the theater. Maybe what stuck in my mind were a few people saying it had one or two really good FX scenes, and also Kevin Bacon's diary of the filming, which made it sound so grueling and unpleasant that I felt some pity for him and thought I should give it a chance. Big mistake. Big, BIG mistake.Most of the other reviews say it all...but I need to write down how bad this movie is and hopefully purge it from my system. You know, I don't ask for the impossible when I sit down to watch a movie. All I really want from a movie, at minimum, is to be entertained or to escape for 90 minutes or so. The movie started out OK but after the gorilla scene, and the two other invisible transformation scenes, it really went downhill. And got worse.Oh yeah, in case you haven't seen the trailer, or read a review, the plot is a group of scientists is working on an invisibility formula, for the government. The leader of the project is smart, but an arrogant jerk. He meddles with mother nature (another no-no in a scary movie) and deliberately deceives people who trust him (again, another mistake) so the formula can be tested on him as the first human. You'll never guess what happens then things go horribly wrong! People turn to murder!  Disaster strikes!  You waste 2 hours of your time and a rental fee because you should have just watched the trailer, which gave the whole plot away anyway!I had low expectations for this movie-all I wanted was for something to surprise me, or there to be a special effect or shock that made me watch the scene/moment again a couple times. Or at least want to. For instance, Deep Blue Sea was stupid and mainly lame, but at least had that one big surprise (you know the one I mean-I won't give it away like someone did to me before I saw it). Nope.I didn't find any of the characters likeable.  Sorry, but I don't have too much respect for any character in a horror/thriller movie that does any of the following 1. walks backward when they know they are in danger 2. turns their back on someone dangerous that they've conked/injured and strolls away without checking to see if they've really been incapacitated 3. immediately separates when they first realize they are in an isolated area being stalked by someone or 4. says something to the effect of well, I'm glad *that's* over when things obviously aren't-and if you've seen even one other scary movie, everyone knows this is always a precursor to the villain/monster immediately swooping down on them again or lunging into frame. This movie has ALL of the above-which I could overlook if the movie was at least slightly entertaining (Bruce Campbell in any of the Evil Dead movies usually does all of the above, but makes it fun to watch, to name just one example).Also-and I see by the other reviews that I'm not alone here- I get really insulted when, especially on top of all the other crap, a villain conveniently becomes indestructible in the last half hour or so with no explanation. About every possible debilitating injury happens to him and it doesn't seem to slow him down. All that was missing was him being shot and the bullets bouncing off him.I expected there to be one interesting or memorable concept, especially since (I thought at the time) the movie had such meticulous attention to detail and seemed to take a very high-tech, scientific approach to the story.  The trailers and background info on the making of this film, plus how long it took in post-production, gave me that impression.  The reviews gave it more credit than it had. I was at first slightly interested in the fact that an invisible character couldn't close their eyes, because they had transparent eyelids. I never thought of that! Hmmm, maybe they came up with some other cool twists. That's about as interesting as it gets, and the only new idea they came up with. (then, that got shot all to hell, because about 1 minute later it occurred to me that the person could wear a sleep mask, or go in a completely blacked-out room). A person graphically stripped of all their layers, reminding you (if you're old enough) of the 'visible man' kit you had as a kid? Been done before (though not as well technically as in this movie). A gorilla doing the same thing?  OK, that hasn't been done before, at least not that I know of, but that's maybe 30 seconds that are slightly interesting. Let's face it, you thinking hey, good CGI occasionally is not enough to build a good movie on- in fact, it's pretty sad.I would run out of room if I went into even half of the continuity errors. Just look at the goofs page-I think I've seen one other movie in the IMDB that had a goofs page that long. Now, I'm the type of person who people have to point out continuity errors to before I notice them. Here I noticed ones I didn't even LOOK for. What happened? Did they run out of time?  Money? The studio rushed them?  What's really depressing is someone probably noticed, but they either were too lacy to care or figured the audience would be so impressed with the CGI that their IQs would drop about 50 points and they'd miss it. Not to beat a dead horse, but if the movie had a character that was interesting, or if any scenes surprised me, or entertained me, I could overlook it being stupid and built around some 'ground-breaking' CGI. Yes, I know what a 'popcorn movie/turn off your brain movie' is, where you just sit back and enjoy the mindless ride. Starship Troopers, Total Recall, Scary Movie- *those* are popcorn movies. It's also not a camp/so bad it's good type movie. Showgirls, Mommy Dearest, Glen or Glenda- those are ones you can sit and make fun of with your friends. No, instead The Hollow Man is just a waste of everyone's time and money, and that's putting it in way more polite terms than I want to.I would only recommend this if you are a CGI/FX junkie,if you thought Armageddon and Patch Adams were deep, insightful masterpieces and and you didn't understand why everyone said anything bad about them, or if you really have the hots for Kevin Bacon (though skip the 'becoming invisible' scene, among others, if you don't want to get completely turned off).

From the flat out bad plot, to the horror movie stupidity of the characters, this movie reeked, even worse, it had such promise...I had high hopes for this movie originally  - it could have been a great movie exploring what a real person would do if suddenly granted invisibility, and how it might slowly erode your morals since Who's going to know?  The temptation would be great, and in the hands of Kevin Bacon, one of the most versitile actors in Hollywood, it would be a superb movie.But Hollow Man disappoints.  We never CARE about Sebastian, and he strikes us as the type of person who might off somebody who seriously got in the way of his progress ANYWAY.  He is crass, cruel and egomaniacal, so his descent and fall is not a surprise; it's inevitable.The plot is like a 22 minute Twilight Zone or Tales From The Crypt episode someone thought might be a good idea for a movie. No surprises, no twists, and so MANY slasher movie cliches it is sickening.  You KNOW what will happen before it does.  I hate it when a movie spends so much time (and money; the special effects are excellent, too bad they are wasted here) getting you to believe in the thin scientific premise surrounding the plot (which I have no problem with; they did a good job here, albiet briefly, and I'm prepared to suspend a little disbelief), and then ignore BASIC PHYSICS and totally and blatently destroy the disbelief they worked so hard to create...Example - End of the movie.  The insane invisible killer gets fried by Elisabeth Shue with an impromptu flamethrower.  OK.  Fine.  THREE SECONDS LATER he is running after her full tilt.  Apparently, invisibility grants super-healing.  He is then hit FULL ON THE HEAD with a CROWBAR, and immediatly jumps up to attack our heroes while their backs are turned. Then, while all three main characters are each standing in THREE INCHES OF WATER he swings a crowbar into a high-voltage box, frying himself and turning himself semi-visible, while the others escape.  Apparently, invisibility also hinders conductivity, otherwise all three would be dancing the electric boogaloo.  Fast-forward - Sebastian is apparently unconcious.  Heroes climbing to escape explosion (which should have fried them all, but thats just an action movie cliche as well  Flames licking at the heros feet while he climbs/runs/drives/jumps to safety.)  Huge explosion.  FROM THE WRECKAGE comes the semi-visible Sebastian?!?!?!  Either he got caught in the explosion, and he should be dead, or he was on the elevator with them, and they would have seen him since he was SEMI-VISIBLE!!! ARGH!!!!  I am prepared to suspend disbelief, but this is TOO MUCH!!! And he has the strength the tangle with the heroine after the MAJOR COOKING, CROWBAR TO THE HEAD AND THOUSANDS OF VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY!!!!  Just ONE of these would be enough the make me say now hold on,... but ALL THREE!!! PLUS him crawling IMPOSSIBLY FROM THE TWISTED WRECKAGE OF THE ELEVATOR!!!To make matters worse, Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue are fine actors both. But to have this movie devolve into slasher movie stupidity is unconscionable.  The cast acts well with what they are given, but this movie has NO redeeming qualities WHATSOEVER!One of the top ten worst movies EVER.

Screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe and director Paul Verhoeven let their invisible man watch women undress and use the bathroom, fondle a sleeping co-worker and slip into apartments to terrorize and assault innocent females.Moreover, by suggesting aggression as a side effect of invisibility, the filmmaking team afforded itself the opportunity to depict as many disgusting acts of violence as possible. The hollow man screams epithets at women before hitting them repeatedly with full force - accompanied by earsplitting thwacks on the soundtrack. That's merely a warm-up for his murderous rampages. This sorry excuse of a sci-fi flick combines the prurient, soft-porn sleaze of Verhoeven's Showgirls with the over-the-top violence of Starship Troopers.Before accepting the leading roles, Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue should have considered what Verhoeven did to Elizabeth Berkley's acting career. Starring in this movie almost guarantees induction into cinema's Hall of Shame. Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a cocky scientist who teams with his ex-flame (Shue) and her secret lover (Josh Brolin) in military-funded experiments that make animals invisible. They have problems reversing the process. Curiosity and arrogance drive Sebastian to test the procedure on himself. The special effects that transform animals and people into invisible states and then bring them back again are the movie's only redeeming element.Otherwise Marlowe's (Air Force One) script recycles every mad scientist and action cliche in the book. Similar to James Whale's The Invisible Man, the 1931 screen version of H.G. Wells' classic fantasy, a megalomaniac inventor plays God and wreaks havoc on the world. Self-interest and revenge motivate his actions. But whereas Claude Rains delivered a radio performance - heard but not seen for most of the film - Bacon gets plenty of exposure. Literally.Add this big-budget thriller that packages misogyny, voyeurism and violence in the guise of entertainment to the Hollywood junk heap. Just don't be surprised when it does great box office.

The story, the characters and, finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50's. There are some great moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets. But alas, soon we're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic.There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven (who does have his moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough, and as a result, Hollow Man is seriously undermined with clichés, sappy characters, predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.However, the one thing that actually impressed me, beside the special effects, was the swearing. When making this kind of film, modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. Therefore, the language (and, sometimes, the violence and sex) is very toned down. When the whole world blows up, the good guys go Oh darn! and Oh my God. Hollow Man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.

Witness the dramatic idea (stolen directly from H.G. Wells, of course) of making animals and human beings completely invisible, without the slightest shred of scientific explanation except for some mumbo-jumbo about quantum shifts. Making organisms vanish is done by injecting them with a lurid orange liquid injected from an immense hypodermic that looks like a Fisher-Price toy (but only after it's been irradiated). Making the creatures visible again calls for the identical process - but this time with a bright blue liquid! (I'm not making this up, honest, although I might have got the colors transposed).The film has its moments of interest and truly amazing special effects--some of the best I've ever seen in a motion picture, in fact. If Who Framed Roger Rabbit was an opening for live action/animation and Terminator 2 was the breakthrough motion picture for pure special effects, this is the next level. It starts with an intriguing premise, just as RoboCop and Total Recall did, only those two films kept elevating the action, suspense, plot, and emotional attachment, something that Hollow Man is lacking. The main problem with this film was putting all the weight on one character, Sebastian Caine (as misplayed by Kevin Bacon). When the main character is a mad scientist, who's obviously already nuts to begin with, where can you go from there? Bacon makes the transition with no perceptible difference. (Amusingly enough, Bacon was chosen over Guy Pearce and Edward Norton for this role because he has the ability to be both charming and diabolical. Neither of which are in evidence in this movie.) As for the rest of the designer docs who make up the cast, none of them struck me as being even remotely scientific. When they finally started the invisibility process on Bacon, I found that I was never happier to see an actor disappear. Pity his character proved so resilient in the end.Overall rating 6 out of 10. "}{"Title":"The Ring Of Glaucon Eclipse","Date":"6 May 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Spoilers AheadLet's get the flaws out of the way up front. Elizabeth Shue was the cynosure of all the critical attacks as the worst acting, hard to believe scientist ever. The casting here was the other weakness, with the exception of a young Josh Brolin, there was pretty weak acting across the front cast. The devolving into a gory slasher picture was the other admittedly well aimed salvo. For me, a philosopher, I have always owned the movie for it is a depiction of the famous argument between Socrates and Glaucon in Plato's Republic. The question of a ring that makes one invisible and the moral consequences of invisibility is the core of both their argument and Verhoeven's movie. Paul takes Socrates' position that it would unavoidably cause moral deterioration and corruption until the person became what makes up the majority of the human soul Darkness. Here, Bacon has a slight contempt for his subordinates, manifests contempt for authority and a fascination with Linda's new boyfriend. Also, he likes spying on the hot woman across the street through her window. What is interesting in the movie is that these innocuous predilections grow slowly into more deadly actions bit by bit. Verhoeven's movie shows the slow crossing of the norms of civilized behavior by Sebastian. He begins by molesting a sleeping woman, murdering a dog and then the descent steepens. I agree with the detractors, as a pure action movie, it gets quite gory near the end. For me, the question is dealt with well and believably. The consequences of anonymity already provides justification for Paul's narrative lynch mobs, the Klan, when people have the protection of being unknown we tend to see just what this movie shows us. Bacon did a competent job but Brolin will show hints of the great actor he was to become. The movie does have pop out scares but Verhoeven tends to cross into the serial killer on the loose thread that so damaged Sunshine. There is clever infrared photography, like Predator, where you are looking with the cast trying to find this invisible psycho on the loose. I never found this boring in the slightest, the ending is quite well done and impressive with the climb up the elevator shaft. We suspect he is there, when I saw this with an audience, his pop out triggered popcorn explosions. The movie reflects my and Socrates' view that the sliver of Light inside of us would be overcome by the temptation of invisibility. Verhoeven attenuates this somewhat by having Sebastian slightly eccentric and hostile at the beginning. The worst performance that damaged this was the gorgeous but bad actress Shue. She did give a good reading in Leaving Las Vegas though I hardly thought it was Oscar worthy. When I saw this with an audience, people were laughing when she was spouting science babble. The movie's violence increases as it progresses; it is not remotely for children. That said, all of Verhoeven's movies are ultra-violent. RoboCop, Total Recall, Black Book, find me one of his that isn't? I consider it quite entertaining, despite a weak cast, with great photography and pop out scare the living crap out of you moments. Paul does some clever things with water, smoke and even has his burned dead skin flaking off as he walks away. I like the movie for its dark honesty about human nature and the patina of civilization that truly is a thin covering over a globe of darkness. Like the opening of 2001, where Kubrick shows you Animal Night and the thin crescent of Light which is human nature. The movie will scare you in parts and is well done. While not being Verhoeven's best, RoboCop, it is not his worst either. As a philosopher it reminds me of the great Darkness inside of myself and to always stand guard over it. Paul's view mirrors Socrates in the Republic. They both argue that the temptation would overcome anyone. If you haven't seen it, check it out. I own it but I would watch it before buying it.

It's this that is the main problem with the picture, it lacks some of the director's bite and satirical savagery, even the souped up sex (natural or deviant) that often comes with his productions. Yet devoid of expectations of a Verhoeven masterpiece, and the crushing realisation that it basically wastes its potential and plays out as a haunted house stalk movie - it's a good energetic popcorner.It quickly becomes obvious that we are entering special effects extravaganza, the opening credits are dynamite, sci-fi sexy, then the opening gambit sequence literally grabs us and a rodent by the throat.

This sounds like prime deranged Verhoeven comedic stuff, but this is so poorly executed and so bereft of his skills that it plays out as by the numbers trash. The characters are all unlikable and Elizabeth Shue is downright awful as the lead. Whether it's a smug smirk or embarrassing dialogue delivery, she gives a terrible performance. The rest of the cast can never rise above the junk plotting and wretched dialogue. Hollow Man turns into a slasher by the second act and the film goes on autopilot - dispatching of less important characters, which can come as a welcome relief as we'll never have to listen to their awful characters speak again.

Strange too because it assembles an armada of talented actors and craftsmen in the service of what turns out to be a Z-grade slasher movie. Why would you want to cast two actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, hire Jerry Goldsmith to conduct a wonderful score and give the movie some incredible special effects and then put them in the service of a story that doesn't try anything new? Kevin Bacon stars as Sebastian Caine, a scientist on the verge of discovering how to make living beings invisible. An opening shot is quite astonishing, showing the visibility serum coursing through the veins of an invisible gorilla. It's veins filling up like twigs and moving to the vital organs until it looks like one of those 'Visible Gorilla' models you see in science class. Bacon grows tired of experimenting on lab animals and is ready to move on to phase three which is, you guessed it, a human experiment.Meanwhile, Bacon's ex-girlfriend (Elisabeth Shue) has been seeing someone new. We know who it is (he works in the lab) and we also know that Bacon will find out via invisibility but by the time we get there the movie is pretty much dead in the water. Why reveal her lover's identity? Why not at least leave something for the audience to think about? Just as fascinating as the gorilla we get to see Bacon go through the same test until his living skeleton disappears. What does the movie do then? Not much. Director Paul Verhoven stops all creativity and decides to have the newly invisible man grope females in their sleep then stalk the other scientists and try to kill them. The movie does have some fun in the climactic scenes as the supporting cast keeps coming up with new ways to make Bacon visible.Speaking of the supporting cast, they aren't much just the usual stock characters who run around behind the more known actors and are required to be killed in the ascending order that the fall in the closing credits. Even Bacon's final scene seems lifted out of a thousand of other movies climbing to catch Shue and her lover in an elevator shaft as fire rises under their feet.'Hollow Man' was directed by Paul Verhoven whose films I have not come to like very much. His only good film was 'RoboCop' because of its sardonic sense of humor and it's bleak vision of the future. His films such as 'Showgirls', 'Starship Troopers' and 'Basic Instinct' are always glossy and slick but never smart or intelligent. It reminded me in a way of 'The Fly' that great 1986 horror flick in which Jeff Goldblume was meshed with a common housefly and had a girlfriend trying to help him as his body degenerated. That movie worked because we cared about his character and we knew that there was chemistry between the two leads. 'Hollow Man' has the set up but no means for a payoff.

I was entertained when I saw it, but also somewhat disappointed; an odd mix. Viewing it again last night I was wondering if I'd have the same impression and the answer is yes.The story revolves around a group of young-ish scientists (who are too edgy and hip to be believable) working on a serum for the government that can make people invisible. Their secret lab is underground in an industrial sector of Washington DC. They've been experimenting on animals, including a gorilla, with some success, but the group leader, Sebastian (Kevin Bacon), wants to take the next step by prematurely experimenting on himself. Havok ensues.Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin play key teammembers, Linda and Matthew. Linda is also Sebastian's ex-girlfriend who's secretly seeing Matthew, which stirs Sebastian's jealousy when he finds out. (But why should he care since he's no longer seeing her?) I don't know if it's the fault of the director or writer, but they go a little overboard in trying to make the protagonists edgy (overkill cussing, etc.) to the point that the characters somewhat lose the viewer's sympathy. Thankfully, it's just a little overboard because most of the rest of the researchers are likable beyond Sebastian. And Linda and Matthew weren't really doing anything wrong by seeing each other since, again, Linda was no longer Sebastian's babe.Even though one member of the team morphs into the villain, he's not without interesting qualities in the first half of the movie. In fact, I can't help but respect his we're the originators of this project so we make the rules attitude and his consequent refusal to submit to the manipulative authorities over him.While there are some outside sequences (shot in DC and L.A.) the bulk of the film is confined to the underground lab, shot on sets in Culver City. The good thing is that these sets are excellent, as far as underground labs go, but it makes for a one-dimensional viewing.Memorable and amusing parts abound, however, like the excellent F/X of the partially appearing/disappearing gorilla and, later, Sebastian. Also, the amusing way invisible-Sebastian has some fun with a couple of kids in another car. There's also a laugh-out-loud joke about Superman, Wonder Woman and the Invisible Man, crude though it may be. I also like the double meaning of the title Sebastian isn't just a hollow man literally, but also due to his ignoble character -- arrogance, lust, etc.While Hollow Man is a sci-fi/thriller it takes on horror elements and clichés in the final act as the researchers are wiped out one by one. Who will survive? So, while Hollow Man is worth watching, it's far from great, mainly because it fails to take advantage of the promising material and essentially becomes a one-dimensional boogeyman movie.GRADE B- "},{"Title":"I'm invisible!","Date":"8 May 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" So I went out to a market one day.I was buying this movie because I remember I had rented this for years ago.This movie stars Kevin Bacon from movies like Apollo 13.The movie starts with experiments on invisible animals.Kevin Bacon plays the man who wants to become invisible too.Then things goes slight out of hand.The invisible man becomes dangerous.In the row of 1999-2000 thrillers/horror/science fiction movies this was one of the better I have seen.If you like this category of movies give this a rent.7/10 "}{"Title":"Hollow script, hollow acting, Hollow Man","Date":"19 April 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Invisibility, a premise that many have often pondered at a time in their existence. What would we do if we were to harness the ability to disappear? Would we travel across country, drifting unnoticed into planes and onto the back of buses, or explore people's true opinions of us when we aren't around? The possibilities are endless, the self discovery and mischief that you could inflict could be catastrophic and without consequence. The allure of the idea finds its foundations within this and there has been an assortment of different scenarios caught on film over the years, one being Paul Verhoeven's Hollow Man.With a filmography that includes such enjoyable popcorn fuelled outings as Starship Troopers and the original Total Recall, the bar was set for Verhoeven, yet it falls short at almost every hurdle. When the egotistical scientist, Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) succeeds in producing and reversing the effects of an invisibility serum, he manipulates his co-workers, primarily his ex girlfriend Dr. Linda McKay, and Dr. Matt Kensington into withholding the information from the military. All for the selfish purpose that he be the initial human test- subject. Clinging on to what he believes to be the pinnacle of his career, he pushes that he should be used in the trial, hoping to stay relevant within the field.The movie deteriorates as Sebastian's exploration of his new-found ability flounders into old and stagnant waters as he fails to test the boundaries of his experiment, instead, he opts to just ogle several women he knows from the female scientists within his team, to the lady across the street before plunging into the depths as it becomes a mediocre slasher film. I expected there to be more of a story arc outside of the confines of the laboratory yet it sells itself short when the remainder of the feature is spent with a seemingly invincible force as he hunts down his former colleagues.Although Bacon's surprisingly versatile acting talent has the strength to carry some of his films, this is an exception. Granted, his performance gives Sebastian layers, yet it is still unable to redeem the rest of the movies faults as his descent into madness seems sudden and unjustified.Regardless, the special effects have stood the test of time with impressive sequences of his transition into invisibility, otherwise, the film has few redeeming qualities as it leaves footsteps on regularly walked grounds, leaving the viewer groaning as the antagonist survives an excessive amount of fatal situations. Whilst Bacon may be invisible, the weaknesses within the plot are all too noticeable for an audience to ignore.

I had no idea what this movie was really but there was nothing else on last night and I also noticed that it was directed by Paul Verhoeven which have directed quite a few movies that I really liked so I decided to give it a try. As it turned out, this is another movie that is somewhat above the usual standard for movies given on SyFy.It has a rating on 27% on Rotten Tomatoes which is just bullshit. But then, the so called professional critics used by the Rotten Tomatoes are dimwits who trash every movie that is not intellectual enough for their self-imagined refined tastes. I do not know why they continue to use these clowns for their official rating system instead of the real audience? On IMDb it holds a 5.6 out of 10 rating which is more realistic. I was hesitating between 7 and 6. In the end I gave it a 6 because, as I said in the title, it is a quite okay movie but not a fantastic one.The story of the movie is a fairly standard one. Scientist experiments on himself, experiment goes wrong, scientist goes mad, hack hack, chop chop, scientist dies, happy ending for the remaining survivors. Thus the movie pretty much relies on its special effects which are indeed quite good. The various invisible effects, not to mention the scenes where Caine is partially visible due to smoke or water effects, are quite enjoyable to watch.Kevin Bacon is making quite a performance as a very disagreeable fanatic scientist. He is doing a remarkably good job of it even when he is covered by a latex mask which of course is quite a feat being deprived of any facial expressions. The rest of the cast was fairly standard Hollywood fare, that is, fairly bland.On the whole I found the movie quite enjoyable. It was perhaps a bit slow at the beginning and Cain's show of megalomaniacal attitudes was indeed becoming a bit tiresome after a while. As I said, his roles was a very disagreeable one. Once he became invisible things started to become more interesting although it took a wee time for things to speed up even then.It was certainly not a wasted movie evening and the movie is worth at least 6 out of 10 stars.

Wells' classic novel. The best known, possibly, is James Whale's fantastic Universal adaptation, starring Claude Rains as the scientist gone mad, and actors from the likes of David McCallum and Chevy Chase have played the title character since then to various degrees of sympathy. It was always a story of the psychological effects a new found power can have on a human being, posing the inevitable question of what would you do if no-one could see you? I wouldn't like to dwell on the things I would find myself getting up to, but director Paul Verhoeven is clear as to what he thinks men would get up to - voyeurism and rape, and this is a key theme throughout Hollow Man, amidst all the extreme gore of course.Arrogant, obnoxious scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) makes a breakthrough in reversing invisibility on a gorilla, but when reporting his success to the Pentagon, he opts to hold back information to gain more time to experiment on himself. Co-workers Linda (Elisabeth Shue), an ex-lover and still the subject of Caine's affections, and Matthew (Josh Brolin), who is secretly dating Linda, voice their objections, but Caine's insistence eventually wins them round, and successfully turns himself invisible. The reverse serum does not work, so Caine is stuck wearing a rubber mask and shades while they work on the solution. But Caine finds that with great power comes endless possibilities, and his behaviour becomes increasingly more erratic and sinister, and begins to sabotage his colleagues efforts to bring him back.Subtlety has never been Paul Verhoeven's strong suit, but where his films are always hugely tacky and pornographically violent, they come with a satirical bite, more often than not at the U.S.'s expense. But where Starship Troopers (1997), for example, was a massive amount of fun as well as being pretty bloody clever (American soldiers dressed like Nazis!), Hollow Man doesn't have the capacity to be anything but a familiar story with a large helping of cheddar and stock characters, and the satire is left outside. It's still enjoyable seeing the various faceless characters receive a grisly butchering, and some impressive CGI (even by today's standards) reveals many inventive ways you can see an invisible man.But it's often embarrassingly over-the-top and the script is woeful even by it's own schlock standards (don't you die on me!). Caine's infatuation with the hot woman across the road (played by Rhona Mitra) leads to a nasty rape, and Caine frequently takes liberties with Linda and veterinarian Sarah (Kim Dickens). It's an interesting theme, and no doubt something that a lot of men would take up given the power of invisibility, but Verhoeven's camera seems to almost enjoy the voyeurism, making certain scenes quite uncomfortable. Yet an enjoyably hammy performance from Bacon overshadows the blandness of Shue and Brolin's one-dimensional characters, and helps lifts the film from bad, to average.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Ghosts are dead.....","Date":"27 August 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" After years of experimentation, brilliant but arrogant scientist Sebastian Caine has discovered a way to make matter invisible.

Some of it has been explored before and it has been used in many fashions. But to have it done in this particular way is another story. Becoming invisible in this world is a scientific reality; not magic. That's what makes this a cool concept. To actually come up with a formula that disguises the human body so that it becomes transparent with any light that is reflected off it is absolutely stunning. And that is what starts off our story here.Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist who cracked the code for making any biological organism absolutely transparent to the naked eye. The problem is that he has never tested it on a human body, until now. So to make sure that it actually does work, Caine decides to test it on himself. This is where the really cool stuff joins the screen. To become invisible, Caine is injected with the serum that will make him transparent. When this occurs, soon all of Caine's skin, then muscles, and organs start to appear. It's as if the viewer is brought back to the days where there were charts of the human body hanging in the science classes.Then there's the case of Bacon's character actually being invisible. A lot of is well done because of how delicate it is to balance between what is on screen and what actually isn't. Making a plastic face mold for Caine so the rest of his crew could see him was an incredible stroke. Let's not forget that Bacon has some fun with his character before he really starts to head off the deep end. It is from there that Hollow Man begins to become frustrating.Soon after becoming invisible, Caine's crew members can't seem to figure out a way of making him visible again. Because of this, Caine starts to become restless and aggressive. Once he heads down this path, he doesn't return. Soon, he begins to disobey his co-workers and runs amok in the lab. It's actually quite disappointing to see because something different could have been done to make Sebastian Caine a little more interesting. Some audiences would have found his performance more appreciative if his character started doing good things out of the ordinary for other individuals. I for one would have enjoyed if he took that path; but that isn't the case.Like any Verhoeven film though, the gore is definitely there. By the finale of the film, Caine is one sick puppy. Some of the weapons he uses on his victims and the way he uses them are just downright brutal. Even science fiction soundtrack master Jerry Goldsmith couldn't help this film. He definitely had the sci-fi tones in his music but no real feeling in it. Come on Goldsmith!It's nice to see Paul Verhoeven do amazing things with the power of invisibility. However, the character of Sebastian Caine isn't anything worth watching. Kevin Bacon tries to entertain but the story spirals down into one big mess.

He's ready to start testing the process on people, and offers himself up as the guinea pig. Trouble arises when they can't make him visible again, and he becomes utterly frustrated, then gleeful when he realizes the power he holds. So it's then a very short trip into psycho territory for this genius, who begins to terrorize various unlucky individuals, including his own team. The movie is certainly not without its flaws, as eventually it does turn pretty routine, a high tech, sci-fi slasher with an overblown, Hollywood style climax, characters who start acting rather dumb, and, to top it all off, a villain whose virtual indestructibility makes him akin to a typical horror movie antagonist. Still, it's extremely well made technically, with director Paul Verhoeven in fine form, and does have a substantially nasty edge that may amuse some fans of the genre. Even at an hour and 53 minutes, it is paced fairly well, and gets a lot of mileage from Bacon's fun villainous portrayal. Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin also do fairly well as the co-leads trying to keep their romance secret, knowing well how ugly Caine's reaction would be to the truth. The main reason to see this movie are the eye popping special effects, especially as we see characters like Caine and the gorilla go through stages of visibility. Even with its flaws, the movie is undeniably exciting and far from boring. Followed by a direct to DVD sequel six years later. Seven out of 10.

I would believe that a frightened scientists, who's afraid for their lives would glue the glasses on, never to lose attention to what's around them at all time. The scene where Sarah is locked in the room with Sebastian is so stupid. She gets all the time in the world to rip up the bags of blood and cover the floor with it, just for the illusion of tension and for the effects, when common sense tells you that a smart and murder crazy Sebastian would have ran up to Sarah before she opened the first bag of blood, and jumped her. The whole sequence is so bad. The scene where Carter is lifted up by his neck by a pipe crawling Sebastian is also pretty bad. As far as i know about the story, Sebastian does not get super strong from taking the serum, just invisible (and f..... mental). The effects in the movie are one of the few positive things about the movie. They really did a good job creating an invisible Kevin Bacon, and the transformation scenes are breathtaking. The actors did a good job with what they had to work with, Kevin Bacon is always great and Josh Brolin is solid. I'm a huge fan of Paul Verhoeven, so this was a disappointment.

At first making the serum was the easy part, making the person come back was not. Most of the first tries ended up unstable. Until one night, when he perfected the formula. And who else, but Caine would be the lab rat. The gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he came to, it was a close one. So when the did Caine, he decided to use it for fun. Then when he got tired of being not seen, the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh. However, the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should, and Caine would delve into madness. So he ends up being one mad invisible killer.

Wells' timeless Invisible Man story, with contemporary calibre special effects and the very underrated Kevin Bacon starring as the arrogant and obsessive scientist - at first glance, the film seemed destined to be a hit. Sadly enough, the film falls somewhat short of its anticipated mark, primarily due to some poor directorial choices and a rather sub par script. Director Paul Verhoeven, who in the late 80s to early 90s seemed to be on a roll with hit after hit of action movies (RoboCop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct) seems to have lost his touch of late, preceding Hollow Man with flop Starship Troopers. In Hollow Man, Verhoeven seems to be welcoming back the chance to wield a large budget, and has a great time constructing elaborate laboratory sets and peppering the film with endless CGI shots. However, Verhoeven is inhibited by the very lacklustre script, and it is in the dialogue scenes that the film really drags. During the action sequences Verhoeven is able to pick up the pace somewhat and create some genuine tension and suspense, though criticism must also be given for his apparent penchant for laughably gratuitous nudity, and his casting of a troupe of ridiculously young and beautiful actors as research scientists. The film does touch on some more profound ideas, such as more thoughtful aspects of the invisibility procedure being explored. (Bacon's scientist is unable to sleep due to his eyelids being transparent and therefore unable to close) There is also a poignant theme of ethics when unable to be detected, and as such the most powerful scene in the movie is Bacon's scientist eyeing his gorgeous neighbour undressing through the window, at first dissuading himself on acting rashly, but then correcting himself with who's going to know?. This concept is intriguing, and one can't help wishing Verhoeven had developed such lines of thought further, instead of turning the story into less of a gratuitous action movie, slapping on the gore and sex as is customary for him, and adding a bit more of a profound, thought provoking dramatic touch, a-la Total Recall. Once again, the commercial approach gets in the way of creating a more meaty and satisfying film. Kevin Bacon is indeed the star of the show here, both convincing at the start as an obsessive and arrogant scientist, and while tumbling into insanity as the film progresses. In the end, Bacon is the only one who really comes away with a satisfying performance, even if he does toe the line of campy perhaps a bit too frequently. Elisabeth Shue is disappointingly bland as the female lead, and Josh Brolin, painfully devoid of character as her co-worker/secret lover has such a soap opera vibe about him, one can't help but laugh as he attempts genuine dramatic acting. In fact, nearly all the cast seem to have been cast mainly for their looks, and turn out horrifyingly boring supporting performances, with the exception of Joey Slotnick who raises the occasional laugh as the comic relief scientist. All in all, Hollow Man comes across as disappointingly hollow itself, with more interesting dramatic themes bypassed for typical explosions, copious amounts of blood and sex. It may be an entertaining enough outing for those looking for a plot with lots of explosions and bits of profundity or fans of Kevin Bacon, but those seeking out a more serious film might want to leave this one in the same state as its protagonist - unseen. -5/10 "},{"Title":"Such a shame","Date":"5 October 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Here we have a great cast - a great budget - and fantastic visual effects and its is used to this mediocre revenge movie.

And I don't know how many who watch Hollow Man, but Sleepy Hollow continues to be sent on a lot of TV channels, so it seems that Hollow Man only was made as some sort of remake of something we had already watched a lot of times. And people bought the tickets and soon forgot all about it. And this is really what the bad part of main stream is all about.

Here in Hollow Man,he seems to be inching back to his naughtier instincts.Dr.Sebastian Caine(Kevin Bacon,NEVER in need of work it seems),is a hyper-kinetic,biochemical genius and he knows it! He,with a team of scientists of varying fields,co-headed by his ex-wife Linda(!!),are under the thumb of the Department of Defense to create a serum that will alter living DNA to render it invisible(!). Armed with modest success and plenty of confidence,Caine,when hitting a wall in terms of DOD support and funding,decides to take the somewhat ethically challenging and dangerous move of trying the serum on himself. As per the movie's plot existence,the serum works,and Dr.Caine slowly devolves from merely an arrogant genius to a sociopath who discovers new and progressively more frightening ways to use his newfound cloak. HIs chief doubters are also some of his closest peersnamely ex-wife Linda(Elisabeth Shue, as cute here as she is pragmatic and serious) and the co-director of the project Matt(Josh Brolin,handsome and wearing almost three different expressions through the ENTIRE movie),who also happens to be having a relationship with Linda to Dr.Caine's not-knowing(!!!). As the project becomes more uncontrollable,as per the test subject,the project becomes almost interminably doomed.A supporting cast of likable talent--Kim Dickens,Joey Slotnik,Mary Randle and William Devane among them--fills out characters who are basically treated as after-thoughts here. The real star of the film(besides Mr.Bacon's constrained scenery-chewing)is--big surprise!--the special effects and they don't disappoint. The vascular models of human and primate bodies is spectacular,and the visual effects of invisibility is done with what I have to presume(since I haven't seen The Invisible Man yet,ditto for many Invisible person films,either) was an effective blend of self-conscious green-screen acting and dimensional camera focus. As for the gore and gut-and-teeth-clenching violence,well,that pretty much IS a Veerhoeven film's traits. This film is no exception at all,and the attacks in the movie are a veritable blend of ways that can unsettle. Let's put it this waythe way Dr.Caine stalks his comely across-the-street neighbor(Rhona Mitra,billed though she had really no lines at all) might be the least VISUALLY disturbing element of the film,but it will probably highly disturb no less than half of the viewing audience.I cannot say this is the best film that anyone involved has ever done,but having said that,this film will probably be a bit of a caffeine boost to those who enjoy their thrillers to be as up-front and testosteronal as can be. I am vaguely appreciative of the kind of things Veerhoeven brings to the table in these films(I WAS mostly repulsed with the whole make-up of Basic Instinct,but I blame that more for Joe Eszterhaus'odious script than Mr.V's direction)and I cautiously recommend this film,hence my summary line.

Troopers isn't worse, but is still a failure attempt.","Date":"20 March 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" **After watching two Paul Verhoeven movies in a row in two days (Starship Troopers and Hollow Man), I'd like to report something I'm sad. Paul Verhoeven is simply an unique director. In my opinion, one of the most gifted and talented science fiction directors of all times, a man who uses violence so artificially, that you believe even more on the craziness of the whole thing concerning a motion picture of his. After the big let-down that was Starship Troopers, I decided to rent and watch Hollow Man. What a waste.The story is about a crew of scientists who are working on an experiment concerning the ability of making animals invisible. The complex has tons of laboratories with cages all the way to the end of a corridor, where they lock invisible animals, like dogs, monkeys, etc. When an experiment of making a gorilla invisible and then bringing it back to visible succeeds, we find the key to the madness in this movie. Kevin Bacon, the leader scientist in the project decides to test the serum in himself in order to change into a hollow man.That's when the movie falls into an abyss. The rest of the crew, including Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, after making the Kevin Bacon experiment a success, can't find a cure to make him visible again. Having the opportunity to create an amazing plot, where they would eventually find a cure and make this movie a much more intelligent motion picture, Hollow Man does the opposite. They can't find a cure perhaps because of the complex human DNA. Obviously the character of Kevin Bacon which besides his huge ambition, is a lovely character, goes mad and starts killing everyone.What should be an intelligent suspense, became just a mindless bloody body count feature with no better premise after it self destructs. I'm hoping after all these years, Paul Verhoeven, which is a director I admire a lot, will come up with something better. "},{"Title":"Not one of Verhoven's better efforts. Almost unwatchable","Date":"30 January 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" For me, Paul Verhoven is a very hit or miss director. I generally like his sci fi, and can't stand anything else he does. This film is an exception to the former. None of the characters in this film are likable, and only Bacon and, vaguely, Shue, have separable personalities. The film is also riddled with inconsistencies and continuity errors which are actually laughable when contrasted with the obviously huge special effects budget.Kevin Bacon plays a megalomaniacal egotistical scientist who has developed a method of phase shifting a living creature so that the subject becomes invisible. When it becomes necessary to test his formula on a human, he decides to do it on himself. And it turns out to be irreversible. What could have been a harrowing emotional journey once this discovery is made, actually becomes a juvenile exercise in perverse sadistic horror-fantasy.The rest of the characters are mostly his research team. Shue plays his former lover and a member of the team. Bacon's character is despicable and I never developed the least sympathy for him. However, I should also mention that I never grew to like ANY of the main characters, and that I found most of their behavior absurdly improbable. Despite her talent, even Shue seemed lost in this script, and never seemed to develop a complete interpretation of her character.Sex plays such an important role in this film that I was forced to wonder about the age of the screen-writer - among whose better credits are both Fast and Furious films. The science in this film is nonexistent, and no coherent attempt to explain what is going on in the lab is made. We are simply asked to believe that 'phase shifting' is somehow linked to the injection of an apparently mutagenic substance, and that the problem isn't getting there, but returning.If there is one reason to see Hollow Man, it is the special effects. The invisibility scenes are very clever and to an extent, startling. But if you want a similar effects experience actually couched in a very watchable and very enjoyable, intelligent, and well acted film, check out the older The Abyss instead.

No movie has ever achieved greater special effects in this movie, for example 1.) When they make the gorilla visible again/Sebastian invisible 2.) Making the blood appear on him as it is thrown by the vet 3.) When Matt sprays the fire extinguisher on Sebastian which makes him visible 4.) AND THE GREATEST ACHEIVEMNT BY THIS MOVIE- When Sebastian goes to the commitee member's house, fights with him in the pool and then kills him, the way they made him appear in the pool was incredible!! Paul Verhoeven I admit has made some extremely provocative films in the past that went unoticed and unappreciated but this should not be included in that group. I know all of you might remind about the Matrix, however, that is VISUAL effects which is a totally different thing. Even so, the Matrix still didn't have better effects than Hollow Man anyway. "}{"Title":"Invisibility the Hollow Premise","Date":"21 September 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" A while ago I caught Hollow Man on cable. I entered at about the point Sebastian Crane (Kevin Bacon), now invisible, infiltrated the young female intern's apartment and started to unsettle her with his pranks. Based on the portion of the movie I just saw, Hollow Man is an implausible, but mechanically entertaining horror schlock fest with undeniably impeccable special effects. However, I believe it is not a truly efficient, provocative, or memorable movie. Why?Its premise, the power of invisibility, in and of itself, really ain't that great!H.G. Wells's own classic novel The Invisible Man meticulously spells out the numerous disadvantages of invisibility. The invisible protagonist himself considers himself a helpless absurdity. Unless you also make your clothes invisible, which the protagonist actually could but didn't have time to do, your naked invisible body is more vulnerable to the elements and to disease. Other disadvantages the novel points out 1) dust, soot, and rain will reveal your outline, 2) eaten meals will outline your invisible stomach until the food is digested. 3) animals such as dogs can still hear or smell your presence. In other words, an invisible person still possesses the flaws of an ordinary human being. Furthermore, ironically, an invisible person would be more conspicuous to the public than an ordinary person. That's because, as the novel points out, invisibility grants you the power to obtain things, but not enjoy them once you get them. Sure, you can rob a bank without being seen, but you can't get away with the money without being noticed.The above-mentioned disadvantages existed even in the novel's 19th century milieu. In modern times, invisibility is even more of a disadvantage. Motion detectors and heat-imaging sensors can detect even an invisible man's presence. Therefore, an invisible villain may get a few limited jollies at the outset, but will still be easily captured by sensible heroes.To its credit, Hollow Man recognizes some of invisibility's disadvantages. However, it artificially shifts the edge to Sebastian in order to even have a movie. Yes, the heroes have heat-sensing goggles, but the lab automatically becomes uniformly warm to hide Sebastian's temperature. Out in the real world, the naked Sebastian would be easily detected and apprehended, so the movie's action must remain in the claustrophobic lab. And, as others have mentioned, invisibility does not confer invulnerability (even if adrenalin surges can partially account for Sebastian's newfound resistance to pain). Finally of course, Idiot Plot components further the movie along.To conclude, invisibility has its (limited) uses and can supplement other abilities, but in its own right is not much to write home about. Why do you think Stan Lee fortified the Invisible Woman's invisibility powers with force-field projection?

I absolutely loved the film, the concept and the character Sebastian Caine right then. During my college entrance exam I even placed a You should be working poster on the ceiling. I didn't find a single defect in the film despite the fact that it was never a major hit here. Now, as the obsession has long died out and I am able to judge the film from a completely neutral position, I watch it again with full attention.The concept is nothing new; the presentation, though attractive, nothing extraordinary. Talented, highly egotistic but sexually frustrated science genius makes a phenomenal discovery and tests it on himself. Its inevitable consequences forces him from regaining his normal life and takes the monster of revenge out of him. Yes, a common plot, screenplay is average, special effects are satisfactory and Jerry Goldsmith's original score adds to its sinister mood. But these are not responsible for my initial fascination with this film.I realise now, it's probably Kevin Bacon. There is much controversy over whether he's a good actor or not. He's done good job in some really good films like Sleepers or The River Wild. And he's been on really bad films like Tremors too. But here I think he's done an outstanding job as Caine. His every facial expression, his manner of speaking, his attitude told as if he IS the character. Even after he became invisible he remained the most fascinating thing in this movie. I loved the character Caine and I cannot imagine anyone besides Bacon to do it. Perhaps he's the only reason why I loved the film so much.

The concept that Do you REALLY think you're along? works very well here, and is emphasized in many scenes. When he was interviewed, screenwriter Andrew W.

It just doesn't work as a sci-if/action thriller, it also has some psychological thriller overtones.Even though it gets increasingly bloody as it goes along, Hollow Man still manages to deliver the goods.

It was directed by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Robocop).If you like science fiction, action, and even psychological thrillers, Hollow Man is for you.

An actor who has made a career out of being nice guys, Bacon finally gets to sink his teeth into Paul Verhoeven's latest gorefest. It's an unoriginal, uninspired movie, but the awesome special effects and Bacon's menacing performance help make it into a deliriously entertaining popcorn thriller.Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist whose team includes Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin. They're working on an invisibility serum, and when Sebastian injects himself with it, the results are terrifying. Soon after the shock has set in, the team learns that the antidote serum won't work. Sebastian gets desperate until finally, he discovers just how cool being an invisible man can be. The rest of the movie involves Sebastian turning into a loonytoon madman, raping his neighbor (it's implied, unfortunately) and killing off his team members one by one. Can he be stopped?The second half of this film is plagued with the usual flaw of horror movies Characters doing extremely stupid things that make you want to scream at them, You *idiot*! Don't go in there! But they're done here with a visual flair and lots and lots of blood. The invisibility special effects are simply AWESOME. Director Verhoeven is apparently good at this sort of movie (this is the first movie by him I've seen), and I think Hollywood should forgive him for the legendary stinker 'Showgirls' (although I haven't seen that film, I've heard it sucks big-time).All the acting is OK, save for Bacon His fearsome performance is what holds the movie together. Elisabeth Shue, coming off her Oscar-nominated turn in 'Leaving Las Vegas', does a good job, although most of her role consists of yelling. Josh Brolin is okay, and so are the other soon-to-be-doomed characters. There's one moment where, being a long-time ducktape user, I laughed Shue uses ducktape to stop Brolin from bleeding. That should tell you that this movie is unconcerned with reality. But that's okay. This movie is really, really cool and I highly recommend it.

When movies have this on screen, everyone can count on a great movie.Hollow Man is a movie that will make everybody's stomach will be tied with twists and turns while cause your hands to grab on to the seat so you won't fall out. EXCELLENTLY EXECUTED FILM.

The effects, like in Verhoeven's other sci-fi movie Starship Troopers, are outstanding, much better than The Invisible Man. The theme is nice and to a greater extent than The Invisible Man or Dark Man, Hollow Man explores the absence of morality in science and the nature of the absence of moral or religious constraints. The scientist as Creator, and the scientist as God, spying at humans from a far. There are also couple of nice moments where people or items are missing from the screen, playing with the central theme of the movie. Verhoeven puts in his usual trademark male and female nudity and sex, and Elisabeth Shue is very nice on the eyes. However, the last part of the movie isn't very imaginative, and ends up being just a spot the boogieman ending with a handful of uninvolving (dare I say hollow?) people you don't really care enough about. Frankly, I cared more about the lab animals. To my mind, the central theme - the danger of the absence of morality in and through science - is not explored enough. However, the special effects are great, if you like special effects.

On contrary to it's obvious intentions, the film got me cheering for Bacon's character because of the astounding lack of charisma of the other characters. Well, maybe not all characters. Keep a look out for Bacon's neighbour in the film. In any case, in the end I actually hoped that Sebastian Caine reached the surface, to at least get some action. That brings me to the locations, well, location. I found the underground lab to be a pretty boring place for a 2-hour film. There's just not enough stuff for an invisible man to mess with to make it more interesting. I haven't mentioned the plot yet, have I? Well, there isn't much of a plot. However, in shortFlamboyant dr. Sebastian Caine develops a way to become invisible. Problem is, his team of scientists can't find a way to make him visible again. Caine goes mad.Conclusion Watch this film for the SFX, which are really good. On a scale from 1 to 10 the current IMDB rating is more than enough for this film.

What more could you ask for?Well, let's start at the obvious.  Although the actors do very well, I'm not certain that we've been given the best possible human props for this special effects masterpiece.  Compare with Total Recall - the previous reigning special effects action spectacular - and you'll see what I mean. Schwarzenegger, Stone, Ironside... it's a formidable crew.  Kevin Bacon does his best, and he does it well.  He's quite believable as a corrupted genius, and of course he's invisible for a good portion of the film.  Perhaps the problem is his invisibility.The main character in this film is clearly the villain.  It doesn't happen too often, and people complain that they want a film from the evil perspective.  Well, here it is.  Unfortunately the story is biased against Bacon's character, and we don't barrack strongly for him at any stage throughout the film.  His invisible antics are interesting (or exciting depending on your tastes) but we are always wary of his actions rather than enjoying his destructive attitude.Nevertheless, both the actors and the story take a backseat to the special effects.  Some of the computer work done in this film has not been bettered as I write, three years later - it is that good.  Impressive considering some other hype films (think Star Wars) fail to surpass the realism of the invisible Bacon character at times.Worth seeing for the special effects.  The 'what would you do?' element may appeal to some, and the typical sci-fi storyline of being trapped and picked off one by one is reliable as always.8/10 and a big smile.

It looks like a B-movie, it acts like a B-movie, but it had the balance of an A-film.'Total Recall' wrecked its Phil Dick source with pointless action (the new Dick adaptation 'Paycheck' suffers the same).  What satire it tried making about the media was drowned in the blood.  The production values weren't B-movie like 'Robo', they were made-for-TV.In 'Basic Instinct' and 'Showgirls' he throws the balance of 'Robo' to the wind and sex gets the honor of being the overloaded item.'Starship Troopers' had half its brain in the right place thanks to Heinlein, but production values, lack of source material consideration (Dick and Heinlein are better sociologists than Verhoeven will ever be), and...worst of all...the cast, killed the project.  The subtexts that made 'Aliens' so powerful were dropped and, once again, the combination of media and violence didn't work.  We get another bloody made-for-TV film.So, with 'Hollow Man', Verhoeven tries to go straight.  He again imbalances the audience in the most sexist and adolescent manner and tries to pull off a hybrid 'Friday the 13th' & 'Alien' film.  In this case, he ruins it with his usual bad PV, acting, and storytelling.  If he became a little more mature with his content selection (as I hope John Woo will), then he might be a filmmaker worth studying.  Until then, he hasn't advanced from being a 14-year-old with a camera.  Why doesn't he remake 'Porky's' with 'Terminator' next?Overall, this film is sad.  Evil exists, yes, but this is a weak attempt at personifying it.  1 out of 5.

However, three out of four of those films are not gratuitous, I did find Robocop gratuitous in areas. But Hollow Man becomes very gratuitous, there are a couple scenes that might make a person get sick. The acting is one sided. Kevin Bacon is the best in the movie, he gives a solid, convincing performance. The supporting actors are mostly adequate.Hollow Man has a weak script, the dialogue is pretty flat and uninteresting in areas. The film contains billiant special effects, they look so real, especially the pool scene. Verhoeven makes the film stylish too, by adding many point of view shots of the invisible character. In a way, I thought the film should have had a darker ending. I was so convinced by Bacon's performance that I was voting for him. It would have made a cooler ending if he won.

Absolutely nothing, except that the special effects are much more believable now than 70 years ago.

Basically there's nothing wrong with this film, naturally it's your average thriller and you'll get pretty much everything you expect from it but that turns out to be the only problem of it.

However, the thing I absolutely hated in this movie was the protagonists.  They seemed cocky and shallow and I found myself identifying with Bacon's character more than them.  I absolutely hated the fact that they got out alive.  I would have been more than happy if any of the other characters had gotten out alive, but I did not like the fact that they violated the rules of the slasher flick.  1) Whoever has sex in the movie dies.  They had sex several times and all they got was a little cold and a little cut up.  2)  Whoever lies a lot dies.  Both of them lied about the relationship they were having, plus they lied about telling the committee everything.  In horror films, the point is usually to kill off whoever is morally indecent.  Both of the surviving characters were the most morally void (besides Bacon, of course) of the bunch, but they still survived.

But you should think again. Evidentally, all the words I've used so far are more advanced than the scriptwriters' vocabulary.Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, an egotistical but brilliant scientist. The script makes us know that he's an egomanic early on, but when Bacon is invisible, they seem to make us forget that. In fact, he's so self-oriented that he names all of his medicines after himself. OK, we get it! Anyway, he and his team are working on making objects invisible. Why not? So after not getting approval from the government, Sebastian goes ahead and tests it out on himself.But, alas, that wouldn't be much of a movie. Sebastian's team, which includes Linda (Elisabeth Shue) who is Sebastian's former lover, Matthew (Josh Brolin), Linda's secret lover, and Sarah (Kim Dickens), who happens to be a vet, can't turn him back to his visible form. And, of course, Sebastian goes mad.Special effects are the film's saving grace. We see all of Bacon's transformations into visible beings and invisible beings, and, despite being somewhat gruesome, were very intense and actually looked real (except I don't really know what everything in the body look like). When Bacon had his facemask on, I totally believed that it was Bacon who was invisible. The script didn't do that. The special FX did.On the other hand, the script, as I've said before, isn't exactly on a Shakespearean level. It's not even on a Sesame Street level. It's something that director Paul Verhoeven realized that he needed to have in order to make a movie so called it together at the last minute. You can tell how deep it is when all the dialogue is what's happening. It's coming down! Keep climbing! And the script had a lot of medical/scientific mumbo-jumbo. Don't expect us to know what you're talking about. Round to the lowest common demonator.You could call this a popcorn movie, except there isn't a lot of action or exciting scenes it it. In fact, I wasn't thrilled at all. I was entertained, but not tense. The only action was at the tacked-on end that seemed too abrupt. If there had been a steady amount of action all throughout, it would have been easier to swallow.The movie didn't know where to go. It didn't hold onto one plot. Hollow Man tried to appeal to many demographs thrill-seekers, action afficondos, romantics, 30-year-old dateless men. It, however, didn't really let us explore on those. And the characters, although we know some about Sebastian, we know diddly-squat about the other half-dozen supporting characters, who just seem to be there when the script called for it.Well, there you go. Hollow Man is an entertaining but thrill-less movie with special effects out the wazoo but nothing underneath the surface (hence the name Hollow Man?)My rating 5/10Rated R for strong violence, gore, insides of bodies, language and some nudity.

Sebastian Caine is a normal workaholic, and he is currently working on an serum that can reverse the formula that makes thing invisible. He cracks the code for the serum, specifying that it is stable. When he goes to work the next day, him and his co-workers test the serum on an already invisible gorilla. They turn the gorilla visible again, and the product is ready to be sold. However, Sebastian doesn't want to sell the medicines until it is properly tested on a human being. Sebastian Caine agrees to test the serum on himself. When he turns invisible, he is confident that the he can become visible again. When his co-workers inject the serum into Sebastian, it turns out to be not quite a success. Sebastian is now invisible, and he cannot turn visible anymore, that is until they find a cure. Over time, Sebastian starts to lose his mind. He escapes from the lab, and his fantasies become reality. He eventually becomes a mad killer. Hollow Man isn't much of an original movie, but it does have some strong points. Hollow Man has some strong points, but some of the actors aren't some of its strong points. Take Josh Brolin for example. His character is Matt Kensington, and in one part of the movie, he is trying to break the code for the antidote. When he fails, he just makes a frustrated grunt sound, while a marker is in his mouth. Josh Brolin gave a great performance in The Goonies, but in here, he didn't quite use all of his acting talent. Another bad actor in this movie is Greg Grunberg (he plays as Carter Abbey). I haven't seen any of his other movies, but in Hollow Man, he gives a BAD performance. Another problem with Hollow Man, is that it is VERY predictable, and very insipid. All the characters have absolutely no personality whatsoever. The only character in this movie that at least has some personality is Sebastian Caine. Another bad problem, is that you CANNOT watch it more than once, and that the movie itself is plagued with horrible lines. Now I'll give some of the strong points. The CG, is of course great. There is a few pairs of boobies, and there is a respectable amount of blood featured in the film. Overall, Hollow Man is a good movie, despite a lack of good acting, and clever characters.

It's on the cusp of being finalised when Caine decides to inject himself in it and be the first live human to go invisible. Unfortunately he becomes a bit too addicted to the dark side of human nature that invisibility allows him to explore.OK so the script's a bit rubbish. The scientific implausibility aside, there's not much substance here. Caine explores his dark inner self, et cetera. Meta psychology-commentary ahoy!

Cue the depth of an evaporate puddle.Bacon tries here, but how much acting ability can you use when you're only on screen half the time, and the other half you're a walking ad for SFX? His former lover,  McKay (Elizabeth Shue), is okay as she fights against her boss and friend but really, there's nothing here worthy of any note in the acting stakes and all I got was noticing the reoccurring cast of TV's `Alias'.Directing? Pah. It's fine. There's a surprising lack of jump moments, considering the potential offered by the premise. Paul Verhoeven instead tries to go for creepy, and unfortunately does not quite succeed. The action scenes are tame and not that well structured. it's not that they're confusing, it's just they're somewhat staid and non-involving. That's not a good thing.

Very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the Hollow Man's wolf.Even as a thriller, the movie falls way short because most of the thrilling scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming this is just a stupid thing I have to do so that the Hollow man can find me alone and kill me.If you read the actual book, while the Scientist (Cane) goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character. In the movie, Cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it. Just sad.

Ignore the implausibility of a top governmentresearch project run by six attractive 20-30 somethings, OK? It willonly make your head hurt.The twists this version bring out of the old saw are that KevinBacon's character, Sebastien, acts a little more overtly on theimplicit possibilities of walking around naked and invisible. Sincehis friends and colleagues who turn into his nemeses are anex-girlfriend and her secret lover, there's a lot of possibility impliedin the initial set-up. The action-finale leaves a bit to be desired,and I suspect the filmmakers decided they couldn't quite take thelogical step of going completely over the top in the direction ofsexual predation (although there's one kind of extraneous, andtherefore somewhat offensive, victimization of a female characterwho is utterly uninvolved with the plot).The film would've been a lot better had they decided to go the'American Werewolf in London' route and add in a lot ofgenre-twiddling comedy to go with the usual horror and actionelements. The special effects are pretty cool sometimes, particularly thesolution to the age-old question about invisible movies about whythe invisible man always just disappears (he doesn't, annd that'swhere the cool effects come in.)I can only give it a mild recommendation if you like movies in thegenre, need a mild brain candy escape, or want to see KevinBacon's package in false color visualization. "},{"Title":"Verhoeven Misses the Mark","Date":"3 July 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Within the realm of Science Fiction, two particular themes consistently elicit interest, were initially explored in the literature of a pre-cinematic era, and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike, with varying degrees of success.  The first theme, that of time travel, has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with yet another version of the H.G. Wells classic, `The Time Machine.'  The second theme, which also manages to hold audiences in thrall, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities.  And this theme, too, has again become the basis for a film adapted from another H.G. Wells classic, `The Invisible Man,' the realization of which, here, is `Hollow Man,' directed by Paul Verhoeven, and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the U.S. Government, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method.  They have, in fact, progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original `visual' state of being.  It's a problem, however,  that Caine, after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved-- or so he thinks.  And when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful, he decides to present the results to the board of directors, in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project.At the last minute, though, Caine demurs, fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level-- the testing of a human subject.  And he takes it upon himself to become that subject, securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given approval by the board to do so.  But something goes wrong, and Caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late, it all begins to take a toll on Caine's mind.  And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential, as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that.  Now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything-- Including himself.Verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting, even thought provoking film; he establishes a good pace and uses the F/X at his disposal to great effect, though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development.  Anyone familiar with `The Invisible Man,' or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know early on that Caine is not destined for happier times.  Still, Verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience.  But he seems bent on rushing toward the climax, and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful, opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood-and-gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he's worked for earlier in the film.  Rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to Caine's suffering, and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven takes the low road, and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level, any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind, along with anything that would have made this a memorable film.  And it's a shame, because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre, and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower.Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves Verhoeven's purposes perfectly.  There's little depth to Bacon's portrayal, but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities.  Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon the time to develop Caine to any extent; the character is mainly a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story, and toward that end, it works.  The film would have been better served, however, had Verhoeven and Bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between Caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part, something that would have drawn them in a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, as it were, as mere observers of an F/X laden extravaganza.Elisabeth Shue comports herself well in the role of Linda McKay, Caine's willing accomplice in the ill-fated experiment, but it's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of Shue's caliber.  The same can be said of Kim Dickens (so magnificent in the 2001 film, `Things Behind the Sun').  Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support the action and F/X.  Both actors are capable of so much more, and deserve better than what they are given to work with here.The supporting cast includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer).  Entertaining to a point, and even successful on a certain (low) level, `Hollow Man' is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been.  Like an annual fireworks display, it will give you some momentary thrills, but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen, without anything special to set it apart.  And it's too bad, because given the talent and abilities of those involved here, it could have been so much more.  I rate this one 4/10.

Spoilers ahead!  A gorilla and Bacon go through an extremely excruciatingly painful and life threatening conversion from a visible state to an invisible state.  There is no dread on the part of Bacon or his crew the second time he is due to endure this torture.  Everyone acts like he's getting a routine measles shot.  Another example of silliness involves the lovely Shue and boyfriend Brolin who were locked in a freezer room.  The thermometer shows the temperature dropping about 10 degrees every 5 seconds or so.  Shue and Brolin are in there for at least 3 minutes and they aren't violently shivering!  It must have been -75 degrees.  Shue was able to sit around for awhile and concoct a powerful magnet to free them from certain death.    Brolin, who received a severe gash by Bacon and had to be dragged out of the freezer is later able to whack Bacon and climb the elevator shaft with Shue like nothing happened to him.  Bacon, who is blasted by a incredible explosion and inferno is somehow able to emerge in the elevator shaft to have one last shot at Shue and Brolin.  Just plain dumb. Suspension of extreme disbelief is a requirement to enjoy this film.This film had a lot of potential, but the writing made it completely uninteresting and grotesque.

Sony Pictures Imageworks and the Tippett Studio were robbed), and from a splendid Jerry Goldsmith score... all of which make you wish that they were part of a better movie.

But I think it's witnessing just HOW relentlessly evil he becomes.  Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 (perhaps 12, if they are mature).

He is the new millennium's epitome of 'The Mad Scientist'. In another film featuring (in part at least) great big primates, he makes one invisible, decided to try it himself against the better judgment of his compatriots. It works, he terrorises the local raven-haired beauty who lives in the building opposite his own by night (though not much is made of this) and eventually manages to murder most of his fellow workers when they threaten to spill the beans of their dramatic and unauthorised discovery. His genius tips him over the edge and we are treated to some quite violent (if completely Hollywood) scenes. Littered like confetti with stunning eye-candy (like 'The Matrix') that leaves you asking how they did it. A little thin on plot, but good supporting performances from Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin make this a most enjoyable ninety-odd minute picture. Would never win an Oscar, but will never fail to entertain.

He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`The River Wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material, however, Bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to compel. The other principals are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver inane dialogue, embarrass themselves.

"},{"Title":"Passing the baton from Hitchcock to Veerhoven","Date":"27 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  (Spoiler Alert) I had always regarded Paul Veerhoven as the Alfred Hitchcok of action/thriller movies. Veerhoven, as did Hitch, has both the ability to create well-crafted, fun-to-watch movies and a flagrant disregard for women. Hitchcock took great pleasure in demeaning (or at least terrorizing) women in films like The Birds and Frenzy. Veerhoven's most succesful American films, Robocop, Starship Troopers, and Total Recall all feature gleeful, cartoon-like violence. I have no problem with that, and hey - someone's gotta be good at that sort of thing, right?Then we come to Showgirls. Showgirls was one of those films so bad that it was good. Indeed, I saw the film in a Burbank theater with an entire audience that was giving it the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment. It made what was otherwise an utterly terrible film quite enjoyable. Sure, the movie was exploitive of women, but with a title like Showgirls you kind of expect that. However, even as I watched the glittery showgirls up on screen mixing it up to the audience's agressive cat-growling and hissing, I got the uneasy feeling that I was getting a glimpse into the darker recesses of a director's mind...recesses perhaps best left unexplored. That uneasy feeling was violently confirmed watching Hollow Man.Hollow Man has a very promising premise A brilliant young scientist discovers a means of making people invisible, but the process also makes them go a little crazy, too. Sort of like The Invisible Man crossed with Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde. Of course, the brilliant young scientist (played by Kevin Bacon who is rapidly taking over Christopher Walken's place on the Top Ten Creepy Actors list) decides to be the first human invisibility subject. The only problem is, he's a fairly unstable sociopath even without the mental side-effects of the invisibility treatment....not to mention the clandestine possibilities of invisibility itself.What happens throughout the rest of the movie is very disturbing in that someone would even think of these things, let alone commit them to film. The invisible scientist starts fondling a sleeping female associate within only hours of recovering from the invisibility process. He also makes several unwelcomed advances on other female colleagues (lifting skirts, following them into the restroom, etc..) that finally culminates with the assault and presumed rape of a total stranger. It's the stuff of prepubescent male imagination...at least up until the rape/assault. It rockets past tawdry right to the upper reaches of sick.Sadly, some of the best special effects to come along in a long time are wasted on this degenerate film. The invisibility is believeable and well-integrated into the film to the point that you forget that you are watching effects and just accept that one of the principal actors is invisible. The transformation sequences are well-executed and fascinating to watch.Hollow Man left me very cold. Yes, these thoughts might occur to someone who had become invisible, and there are certainly people in the world evil and/or sick enough to do the things Bacon's character does in the movie. But none of it really advances the plot or are necessary to the development of the character. We know what a twisted, sick (expletive deleted) the character is we don't need it spelled out. It's offensive and detracts from what could've otherwise been an interesting film. I have no problem with violent or dirty movies, but Hollow Man is a dirty movie pretending to be science fiction, almost as of the filmmakers were ashamed of what they had done.Maybe they should be.

Luckily, I had read the reviews and some comments on this site before settling down to watch Hollow Man, so I was able to opt for the first scenario...  Bacon can be a terrific actor, and he shows it here despite not being onscreen an awful lot.  He manages to wring every drop of evilness from his character, by and large using only his voice to do so.  That shows talent.   Everybody else is pretty much left on the sidelines.  The effects are fantastic, and if the premise appeals to you from the get-go then you'll probably have a blast.  The endless repetition of characters being killed off in the final third does start to wear a bit thin, but keep in mind that this is Hollywood moviemaking done strictly by formula, and it all begins to make sense.  No, there probably isn't the need for all that nudity; but hey, this is Verhoeven, and I have to be honest and state that that was probably one of the reasons why I rented it!  I watched on a slow Sunday night, with the curtains drawn, lights dimmed and a large bag of sweets.  This, I would suggest, is the best way to approach Hollow Man.  Watch it in the cold light of day and you may begin to notice more how badly it insults your intelligence.  Even I noticed it at the time, the difference was, I just didn't care.

That is the use of special effects to the exclusion of any story and the laziness that goes with it.  The beginning of this film is so impressive and sets up an incredible premise.  Of course, no one has imagination to ask the basic question  If I were suddenly invisible, what would I do?  Even if the guy had decided to become a criminal, using what he could do to pillage and fill his life with filthy lucre, there would at least be a movitation for that. Instead we get the newest incarnation of Freddy Krueger or Glen Close in Fatal Attraction, the unkillable, wading through blood and gore, finishing off his friends, one by one.

The world of film is always judged by the directors. The improbably named Hollow Man (He's not hollow, he's invisible) has met with some derision in the press, and cited as another of Verhoeven's big failures.However, this seems to place the blame unfairly in Vehoeven's court, who has, after all, to contend with an incredibly dated script. While the use of sex, mega violence, huge explosions and state of the art FX is modern, the plot lines and character dynamics are no more advanced than a film from 1933.While the effects are generally outstanding, and visually thrilling, the two-dimensional predictability of the support cast and cliched love triangle workings drag the whole thing down into a (pardon the pun) seen that, done that movie. Characterisation is spelt out in cranky exposition, and any plot developments are clearly signposted. Kevin Bacon brings a lot of personality to the role, and does well using largely his voice. Yet this rather predictable horror set up shows its dated origins by the fact that when Bacon finally begins his killing spree, the first people to get wiped are the black character and the fat guy. It's like the 80s and 90s never happened.Some of the problems relating to invisibility are addressed - such as Bacon having transparent eyelids. However, the fact that he wouldn't be able to see in the first place if no light was reflecting off his eyes is glossed over. As is the fact that food vanishes when entering his mouth, and yet we can see internal injections. And when the film ends with Bacon being hit multiple times by a flame thrower, smashed over the head with a crowbar and being fried alive by several thousand vaults - and still walking! - you realise this is just a mindless popcorn fest. It's okay, but you expect more from the man who gave us Robocop and Starship Troopers - dumb films on the outside, but with satirical bent and political subtext.Into this context we have the rape scenes. Most of these are implied, though their presentation is used more for titillation than actual commentary. What could have been an intriguing morality tale is blown up into the most dubious form of entertainment. Roll up, roll up, come and see the woman raped by the invisible man. Okay, the camera does cut away (though after Rhona Mitri has had her breasts groped) but the way in which such an act could be presented as popcorn fodder is risible in the extreme.And when Bacon's big verbal pay-off is the charmless I always knew you were a bitch! you can see the level of intellect gone into a script that sorely needed a second draft. Aptly named, for it has no depth or meaning, Hollow Man shows the innate worthlessness of CGI Claude Rains may have had cups on string, but the performances, direction and dialogue made it a hugely greater film than this one. Ultimately Hollow Man ranks along with Basic Instinct as the worst of Verhoeven's English-language films. And yes, that does include Showgirls.

Having successfully applied his invisibility formula on animals and reappeared a gorilla with the perfected serum that regains visibility, Sebastian and his chief colleagues, ex-lover Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and her clandestine boyfriend Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), are ready to approach the Pentagon scientist (William Devane Space Cowboys) with their government-funded top-secret discovery. However, Sebastian is overwhelmed by ambition, and first convinces Linda and Matt to secretly aid him in applying the formula on himself in order to broaden his research and be the first human to experience the process. To their astonishment, the experiment proves partially faulty and Sebastian is trapped in invisibility. Horror ensues from Sebastian's mental transformation as he discovers boundless levels of power within his invisible state. Free to unleash all contained malicious tendencies, Sebastian will do anything to preserve his unique gift.Hollow Man revels in the spectacle of the physical transformations --from invisibility to visibility, and vice-versa-- of its two subjects, the gorilla and subsequently, the protagonist. Hollow Man may be regarded as a triumph of cinematic visual effects. Hollow Man successfully integrates special effects to character transformation, by showing the appearance or disappearance of the intricate layers of the body. The visualization of the layers between the skin and the skeleton is realistic, and thus, sustains Hollow Man's efforts to portray a world of futuristic science. In addition, the monstrous end-result of the protagonist's transformation offers an intriguing premise, one which Verhoeven relates to Plato's writings on invisibility which state that ...morality is...defined by what others know and expect of us. In this sense, the character of Sebastian Caine is adequately established as a futuristic monster with universal appeal. However, in spite of an attractive premise that revisits the biblical notion of forbidden knowledge, and of a character that confirms the disturbing fact that ...scientific knowledge is never safe from criminal exploitation,  Hollow Man fails to resist its own downfall the story abandons the psychological exploration of the monster, and instead focuses on the sophisticated visual representations of it. Predictably, Hollow Man evolves into a story of persecution that focuses on containing the monster.

Actually, that's the last ten minutes. And therin lies the problem.Not only is the potential to make a creepy flick about a madman slowly chasing down prey ruined, all of the deaths in the film happen within only about a second/minute within each other! There is no suspense in what is most of the movie, the characters are under-played to perfection, and Kevin Bacon's charcter is as hollow as the name suggests. Are there any redeeming qualities? Well...more thought was put into the special effects that well-developed charcters or a well-paced plot. But at least the SFX are nice, but they are only the tasty icing to the big, sour-tasting cake. I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane here, but this is hopefully the last in the series of mindless SFX films lacking plot. SFX buffs will dig it, but if you like a film with an OK plot, but turned great by convincing and well-developed characters, you should just watch a James Cameron film (minus Titanic).It also tries to be one of those 'fun' movies like the Mummy at the same time. I'm not even going to go there. Bottom line is, the title tells it all. Very hollow, not enough cream filling, if you know what I mean.

That's the story that HG Wells started, and has been carried through cinematic history to Verhoven's HOLLOW MAN. There are a couple glaring errors in the otherwise gorgeous and disturbingly real special effects.  But other than that, the story is the same old thing with a year 2000 twist. There's only so much of this story that should ever come as a surprise to the viewer.  The rest is just the Invisible Man genre/cliche.Elizabeth Shue is taking advantage of the fact that she's getting too old for the cutie-girl roles, and playing scientists now. She just needs to pick slightly more plausible movies in which to play a scientist. In this, she seems little more than a comely toy for Caine's uninhibited tendencies once he becomes invisible. SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT! .....Four important things that would've kept the people in HOLLOW MAN alive 1)  Tranquilize the gorilla BEFORE you make it invisible. 2) When you know well in advance that the invisibility serum causes erratic and aggressive behaviour, you put a transmitter or tracking device on your volunteer that he can't take off!  3) Don't answer the door wearing only your bathrobe if you can't see who rang the bell.   4) Do not turn your back on the invisible guy just because there's a camera on him! But to their credit, the scientists did have the presence of mind to start with fire extinguishers and sprinklers to give them a slightly more even chance against Sebastian Caine once he turns the whole thing into a game of cat and mouse.Best line  It's amazing what you can do when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror anymore.Funniest moment Two children spot Caine in his car wearing his latex mask. Caine takes off his shades and opens his mouth, revealing nothing but the back of the mask through the holes to the children.Four stupid things in two hours isn't a bad average.  The goofs in the SPFX were forgiveable in that the movie's rating was only PG-13.  Bacon's performance was solid and believable.  Shue needs to work on hers a bit.Oh, and the enhanced strength and resilience other reviewers here have complained about?  That's not a flub.  The insane or people on hard drugs such as PCP have exhibited berserker strength and resistance to injuries that would capacitate an ordinary person.

If the hollow man needed sunglasses to see properly, why didn't they just turn on every light? Wouldn't they have at least a small advantage?2.  One scene Bacon had heated up the corridor to make the air temperature the same as his body so that the infrared goggles became useless. So of course the characters tossed them aside. Didn't it occur to any of them that the goggles might have been useful in other rooms with normal air temperature?  And splitting up to search the premises while being stalked by a psycho?

With all the millions available to the filmmakers, couldn't they be just a little more creative?4.  If you were invisible, what would you do?  Go on a rampage or screw with passersby on the street?

Why did they have to kill off the two coolest supporting characters first? The black woman and the larger white guy were knocked off before the obnoxious vet chick, who was by far the worst actress in a mainstream science/action flick since Saphron Burrows in Deep Blue Sea.8.  Why did all the murders have to be so gruesome and morally bankrupt, and shouldn't these bloody deaths have at least some emotional impact on the others? I've grown awfully weary of gratuitous bloodshed without purpose or consequence. They're your colleagues, and all you can do is look momentarily startled and move on? And what about all those caged animals that died fiery deaths in that explosion that the movie apparently forgot about? Awful.9.  With a female as the film's lead character, shouldn't the producers have hired a director that sees woman as complex creatures instead of one that's a nasty misogynist (hence all the unnecessary boob shots here)?

Never at any moment is it ever explained whey Sebastian Kane went from being an egocentric scientist to becoming a full-blown psychotic schizo!  This could have been easily corrected by showing three minutes of footage of the Gorilla suddenly going nuts as a side-effect of the serum. I guess we are supposed to just assume that that is the reason why Kane goes buggy towards the end but it would have been nice if they had bothered to take the time to explain that to us.  They also fail to explore the highlights of having this kind of power.  I would have liked to have seen more of Kane stalking the city and playing the part of the voyeur. Instead, we have him raping women, smashing dogs and otherwise not being much of a gentlemen.

Is Hollywood trying to portray what it considers typical behavior?  Maybe their view reflects their lives?  Coarse and distasteful.

It had groundbreaking computer special-effects.  It had a script by renowned author Micheal Crichton, also responsible for Jurassic Park.  It seemed like the perfect blockbuster hit.  Instead, it became a one-dimensional joke of a movie with only the special effects keeping it from being completely dismissed as hack-work.Hollow Man is the Twister of invisible-man movies.Okay, so maybe we had a little bit more warning with Paul Verhouvan's name in the credits.  Although he made brilliant sci-fi satires with Robocop and Starship Troopers, he also made Basic Instinct and--lest anyone ever forgive and forget--Showgirls.The movie starts off well enough and certainly Kevin Bacon can't be faulted for a very convincing performance, but the first twenty minutes of the movie could have been deleted and replaced with a message saying Sebastian Caine is a jerk and other people don't like him.But then Caine turns invisible, Kevin Bacon becomes a voice talent, and the movie gets really interesting...right?  Not exactly.  While the special-effects are amazing, Caine never seems to be slowly breaking down due to his isolation from humanity--he merely devolves into an invisible wise-cracking Freddy Krueger with no real explanation.Although the special effects remain impressive--just check out a battle scene in a pool--the story just sinks lower and lower until finally the research team battles against a Sebastian who has not only become a standard horror movie villain, but has become inexplicably indestructable...the Terminator died faster and with less of a struggle than this supposedly human character.There are other problems--the research team all look like 90210 cast members, the scientific principle behind invisibility is only given the vaguest explanation, Sebastion's often-mentioned genius is never given a demonstration, the opportunities of an invisible man loose in today's world is never shown or even mentioned, none of the other actors are capable of conveying anything except anger, fear, and boredom, the last twenty minutes of the movie pile one absurdity on top of the other like a house of cards, and so on.This movie, like Twister, will be remembered for its special effects, and maybe for Kevin Bacon's admirable attempts to breathe some depth and complexity into the character of Sebastian Caine, a true hollow man at home in an equally hollow movie.

This isn't a science-fiction movie, okay? This is a horror movie.  Well, if you want to get technical, it starts out like a crappy science &#150;fiction movie, then it turns into a teenager-slasher movie, then it turns into a horror/monster movie, then it turns into an escape movie, roll credits.I don't want to totally rip the movie, it has its moments.  The science-fiction part of the movie is intriguing and is filled with brilliant special effects.  Unfortunately, it all goes down hill from there. Everything gets worse, even the special effects.  Don't get me wrong, these are some of the best special effects I've ever seen, but once the movie turns into a stalker/monster movie, we see less and less awe inspiring effects like we see in the beginning.Honesty, I wasn't really disappointed because I wasn't expecting much to begin with.  Come on, think about it.  Hollow Man.  Who ever came up with that title should be shot.  I remember about a year ago when I saw the first trailer for this movie in the theater.  Everyone in the audience laughed when the words Hollow Man came across the screen.  I thought this movie would be a stupid horror movie that would put its money into its special effects rather than into, well, everything else.  Guess what, I WAS RIGHT! So, I was not disappointed.  Oh no, not at all.One of my biggest problems with the film is that it gives up the chance to be smarter than it is.  I mean, it will never be smart, but they could have done something clever in the damn movie.  This movie in a word predictable. But I'm not complaining.There are also some major logic holes.  None of them pertain to invisibility.   Most are continuity errors (like Mrs. Shoe running through a downpour of water, getting soaking wet, and in the next shot she's perfectly dry).  The other logic/continuity errors are pretty obvious, so I won't ruin the surprise for all of them.One other point, this movie ain't for kids.  It can get pretty perverted. Paul Verhouven, the director, has been known for this, so I expected it.  I had no real problem with the nudity and sexuality, I'm just warning you soccer moms out there.So is the movie worth the money.  Eh, sort of.  I feel sorry for anyone who spent $7.50 for it in theaters.  But, it is worth the price of a rent maybe. I mean I didn't totally hate the movie.  I got what I was expecting.  Let me say this if you're going into this expecting a bad movie, then you're getting your money's worth.  Don't come out of this movie saying, OH, THAT WAS TERRIBLE.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!  You have no right to say that!  Did you think a movie named Hollow Man would actually be good?  Ha!  I laugh at you.  There is no way a movie about an invisible man could be Best Picture worthy, so don't go into this thinking it will be.So, in conclusion, I think the great special effects and the gorgeous Elisabeth Shoe are worth the price of a rent.  But, if you haven't seen the movie and want my advice, wait till it comes on HBO.  It really isn't worth too much money.  I was actually thinking of buying the DVD, because it is supposed to be a great loaded transfer.  But, nah, the movie is just too bad.The whole movie reminds me of a cheesy science fiction film from the 50's, only with good effects.  This is a big-budget B-MOVIE folks, not much more here, move along.I'm not disappointed, it's what I expected it to be a bad excuse for a CGI demo reel... like the Haunting!  Only the Haunting's trailer actually convinced me that it looked liked a good movie.

Verhoeven seemed to be challenging us to think `This looks great and we're having a lot of fun-but there's a message here.'  Unfortunately, what the message was wasn't always clear.  Critics are still arguing over what Verhoeven was trying to accomplish in `Starship Troopers.' Was it a polemic against fascism (Neil Patrick Harris looks like a Nazi at the end of the film), or like the book a militaristic work?It looks like Verhoeven abandons any attempt at deeper meaning in `Hollow Man.'  The story is a twist on the `Invisible Man' series.  Kevin Bacon heads a team working on a secret government project.  The twist isn't that the team is working on a formula to make people invisible-they've already figured that out (although the movie doesn't adequately explain how).  Instead, the team must figure out how to make the invisible visible again.Bacon discovers a solution, and volunteers to have it tried out on him.  Unfortunately, he gets stuck in `invisible.'  Like all good scientists who are turned invisible, he becomes progressively mad and violent.  He spends the latter part of the movie trying to eliminate the rest of the team.The special effects are extraordinary, particularly when the team tries to make an invisible gorilla visible, and when Bacon is made invisible.   And Bacon, one of our most underrated actors, is terrific.  He wrote a two-part article in Entertainment Weekly about how painful and exhausting it was for him to make the film.But by the end of the movie `Hollow Man' turns out to be a predictable thriller.  The audience pretty well knows who is going to survive the mad Bacon, that Bacon's character will be almost impossible to kill, and that somehow along the way the good guys will outrun a fireball.  All of this is exciting.  But somehow, we've come to expect more from this director.

He and his crack research team, funded by the military, have succeeded in making a gorilla invisible - but not in making her visible again. Caine, with the personality of a cactus, finally reaches his breakthrough after an all-night session of caffeine and Twinkies. Marshaling his troops, Caine injects the gorilla with a new serum and the animal is brought back to visible light, albeit with a lot of difficulty.Caine, along with his top lieutenants Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and Matthew (Josh Brolin) in tow, reports to the military committee that has lavished grant after grant on him and his team. Caine shocks his colleagues, however, when he doesn't report the true success of their research. Later he tells them confidentially that he believes if the project funders knew of the team's success, they would take over the project. He asserts that the logical course of action is to move on to Phase 3 of their project - human testing. Naturally, Caine arrogantly volunteers to be the guinea pig, saying that as the project's leader, he should have the honor.Well, if you paid any attention to the previews of this movie, you can guess there were some complications. For one, the serum injected into the gorilla isn't sufficient to bring Caine back to the land of visibility. The caustic Caine, growing increasingly aggressive, at first waits semi-patiently while his team tries to find a way to bring him back. Ah, but then he gets restless..The key to this film is Caine himself, of course. He's never portrayed as a nice guy, always as a driven, possessed man scientist who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. This means that when he becomes invisible - and turns on his team - the change isn't a Jeckyll-and-Hyde transformation. To me, this is good character development. And Bacon plays him well, playing against his normal persona of good guy (and sometimes of good guy gone wrong, as in his recent Stir of Echoes). You never think to yourself, Oh, it's Kevin Bacon. He'll have a change of heart near the end and save the day and get the girl. Truth is, Bacon usually plays likable guys. This time, though, Caine's not likeable he's despicable, absorbed in himself, wallowing in a mire of reckless ego. At one point he tells another character he's God. I'm not one for giving away endings, but I will tell you that Caine is true to character throughout the movie.This is a movie with razor-sharp teeth. It's the kind of movie that'll sneak up on you while you're walking down the street, drag you into an alley, and gnaw the nose off your face. It's a tough movie, bitter in its depiction of man versus nature and what man knows may bring out his demise. This is more than a simple remake of The Invisible Man, although it does owe a bit of its origins to the book by H. G. Wells and the 1942 movie of the same name (which starred Claude Rains). As expected, the effects are dazzling - see Caine turn into smoke, fog, water, and so on while invisible, the elements swirling around him like a three-dimensional silhouette. Special effects, when done properly, can be very poetic, and the crew on Hollow Man deserves highest praise. Bacon's supporting cast deserves a little credit as well, but not too much. Oddly enough, Shue is billed ahead of Bacon, even though it's clearly his show all the way. Her role is that of the ex-lover who's on the team because she's such a dedicated scientist and who also happens to be involved with someone else on the team, without Caine's knowledge. She gets to play good girl/heroine in this one, although one suspects her award-winning talents weren't really put to the test here. Brolin, as her love interest, isn't much more than a bland quart of vanilla ice cream - the store-bought kind without the flecks of vanilla bean.

Breathing shallow!  I don't know about her, but I thought the guy had bigger problems.Then there is the ridiculous scene in which Elizabeth Shue is locked in a freezer. Kevin Bacon has turned the temp down to 30 degrees below zero, and somehow she is not only NOT DEAD within minutes, but, clothed in a light, clingy top, she doesn't even appear chilled. I never was made to understand just what made Kevin Bacon's character such a jerk.  I only know he was utterly unlikeable. Then there are fundamental questions about his behavior while invisible. Such as, why was he hiding behind the bushes in the general's yard before sneaking up on him? Habit?The filmmakers must have had low expectations of their audience's intellect, and it showed in many little ways, like how the serum that makes you invisible is BLUE and the serum that reverses it is RED. Just so you won't get confused, you see. The actual transformation, while well done effects-wise, was absolutely repulsive to me. I did not care to see a bloody, living anatomy chart mess of muscles, guts and veins flopping around on the gurney in agony. Just plain disgusting.

The only film that he's made that I truly love is Robocop. That movie worked because he was essentially making a low-budget B-movie, but the care of the all of the crew and actors made it truly something special and elevated it to true classic material.Since then he's lost whatever sense of directorial vision and/or ability that made Robocop work and his films have become increasingly more condescending and formulaic (with Starship Troopers being an exception).Which brings me to his latest film, The Hollow Man. The invisible man angle has some inherent fascinating potential, and for the first 45 or so minutes that film delves into that mindset with some amazing special effects and solid acting. But somewhere along the line the script flew off the rails, because not too long after Kevin Bacon becomes invisible the film quickly turns into a really stupid and extremely silly slasher flick with an ending that is sure to make you laugh your butt off (unintentionally of course.)In the hands of a better director and with some script revisions this could have really been something great.

This is a Verhoeven film after all, so I guess the second point shouldn't be a surprise. The question of what an invisible man would do with his new-found power goes all the way back to Plato and the Ring of Gyges. Verhoeven's answer is -- rape, violence and murder. This is a turn off for some people, who criticize the subject matter as being beneath contempt. Two reasons why I think this is an invalid criticism of this film 1) For all it's money, this is a B-movie concept, with all the gratuitous subject matter that comes with it, and 2) Real-life experiences when societal norms break down indicate that behaviors such as rape and murder escalate greatly, so the Bacon character's behavior, while often over the top, isn't all that unbelievable. Without the restraint of society, the Bacon character goes to satisfy every lust and impulse, including feeling up female co-workers, killing animals that annoy him, raping a sexy neighbor (a reportedly graphic scene that was cut in the theatrical release but will be on the DVD) and murdering potential threats to his plans.Who will like this? Horror/sci-fi lovers, lovers of B-films and action movies. If those movies tend to not be your cup of tea, you will probably be better off avoiding Hollow Man. With the ending as weak as it is, you're not missing a great film anyway.

He chooses interesting stories to tell and is a stylish director visually, but his treatment of the subject matter leaves a bitter taste. With Hollow Man, the concept of a man finding his powers after becoming invisible had such great potential, but by limiting the movie's protagonist(Kevin Bacon/Dr. Sebastian Caine) to a one-dimensional negative character, he has let us all down. Instead of focusing on the potential hell that the main character could unleash on the outside world, the director goes for the sex and gore overkill by focusing on violence and needless scenes of women being groped and pawed at. Pitiful to say the least, despite some awesome sfx sequences involving an invisible gorilla being made visible again and Kevin Bacon literally going invisible in front of our eyes, bit by bit!!

Basically it's Predator meets Alien.  It wastes the opportunity to create the definitive version of the centuries-old invisible-man tale to give us just another monster movie.  The problem is that by now we know the formula of the monster movie so the audience can predict the order of deaths and who gets left alive at the end.  I would rather be given surprises than given predictable sensations.  The film raises an interesting point about characters.  All the characters in the film are known archetypes we've seen before.  On the one hand that means Marlowe can go straight to the action with little setting up needed.  On the other hand, it means the action is boring because you don't care enough about the characters. It's a difficult balancing act, I admit, but Hollow Man fails.It's an OK entertainment with great special effects but it's - and I can't resist saying it any longer - a bit hollow.

Some of the lines actually made me laugh out loud and really don't think that was their intention.

And the leading actor proves his being worth working with such masters, - Kevin Bacon is as amazing as ever.Unfortunately, no movie has been perfect so far; in 'Hollow Man', the disappointment is brought in by the rest of the actors. Elizabeth Shue managed not to be able to play a good character. She is very unconvincing and (perhaps due to some weaknesses in the screenplay) cannot support her 'goodness' with enough arguments in favor of her opinion. The rest of the crew just sink beneath the antagonisms between Bacon's and Shue's characters. (I suppose they weren't meant to be very necessary, either...)

Verhoeven, always one for social commentary, makes a strong case for how terrible man may be when not confined by rules and restrictions.  The film asks, literally (by one of the characters in the movie), What would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen?  The answer, in the form of Kevin Bacon's character Sebastian, is quite disturbing.  Would we all be liberated and commit haneous crimes of rape and murder?  We would hope not, but clearly Verhoeven is not so sure. And this daring statement of human nature is classic Verhoeven, comparable to his critiques of corrupt big businesses and governments in Robocop.After inventing a syrum that will render any living being invisible to the human eye, Sebastian, whose ego is so inflated that he refers to himself as God, feels the urge to try the secret formula out on a human for the first time.  He volunteers himself.  The result does, in fact, give Sebastian the opportunity to do whatever he pleases, because he can not be identified or connected with his actions.  Then the greusomeness begins.  While his lab partners try to make him visible again, Sebastian becomes increasingly demented and dellusional.  There was a point about 3/4 of the way through this movie that I feared it would degenerate into just another Alien-type/slasher movie sendoff.  While this is somewhat true, the last parts of the movie do indeed work. Throughout, the movie is greatly helped along with truthfully astonishing computer effects.  These really are groundbreaking effects shots by Sony Imageworks and Phil Tippett Studios.  I guess this is to be expected, because Verhoeven films ALWAYS raise the bar one notch further. Another virtue of the movie is the good acting by the main leads, namely Bacon and Elizabeth Shue (a surprisingly effective action heroine).

You can guess what's happening next without having a degree in media studies.  'He's dead, let's turn our back on him and walk off without properly checking first...', that kind of thing.It's pretty obvious in the film that either a) Paul Verhoeven is a dirty old man or b) Elisabeth Shue is deperately trying to re-invent herself as a 30-something sex symbol!  She wears the tightest tops and trousers known to man, she gets her kit off as much as she can but strangely in one scene where she's VERY cold, something is visibly missing but i won't go into that too much.The one thing that can be commended as first rate are the effects. The production budget has been mostly spent on these and it's very obvious from the part where Kevin Bacon very slowly dissolves to the wires attached his invisible face; because there is SO much detail throughout you do actually believe that you're watching a transparent Kevin Bacon.I can think of much worse ways to spend 2 hours in the evening than watching Hollow Man.

It seemed such a good idea on paper, but managed to end up disappointing me.   It starts off quite well, explaining the story and reasoning behind their research. However, I couldn't help looking at my watch, wondering when the other scientists were going to make Sebastian Caine(played by Kevin Bacon) invisible. Before that point, it was moving too slowly.  As the character first explored his invisibility, it was interesting to watch as he got to grips with the idea of voyeurism without actually ever being caught. This seemed quite a sophisticated premise on which to base a film.    However, once his brain began to turn and he became perverted and psychopathic, it descended into the usual, unsophisticated, slasher-style fayre. It reminded me of that genre because, instead of having a crazed, psychopathic killer on the loose, we watched an invisible (who you could see half the time, anyway due to fire extinguishers, etc.), crazed, psychopathic killer on the loose.      In the Scream series, it was a deliberate joke that the parties kept splitting up. However, in this film, the victims, who were apparently the creme de la creme of science, but were actually quite limited when it came to common sense, kept separating, just to be picked off one by one so that the remaining parties could find them dead. It just became a guessing game of which dimwit was going to die next.     The effects were not exactly amazing and although described as so by others, I wouldn't have said that they were ground-breaking.     Kevin Bacon was at his hammy (no pun intended!) best and what was Elisabeth Shue doing in it? The lady from Leaving Las Vegas has really gone downmarket.      The entire film, from start to finish, had a distinct air of a B-movie/TV movie.      It was perfectly watchable.

You know, this is the man who made great fun stuff (TOTAL RECALL, BASIC INSTINCT)... but also unbearable stinkers (SHOWGIRLS, STARSHIP TROOPERS). So we should also have in mind that we couldn't expect a masterpiece or something that is Oscar worthy. But we should, at least, expect a fun and maybe even scary horror/sci-fi movie. Well, I can almost say that it is. However, HOLLOW MAN is a victim of a stupid tendency in Hollywood nowadays solve all the troubles with much, much action and illogical and totally idiotic situations.The plot of HOLLOW MAN is not original, of course. The story of the invisible man who changes his personality with his new state was used lots of times before. But Paul Verhoeven gives a new and more violent treatment to the situation. The guy really enjoys his new situation and now that none can see him, he listens to conversations and comes to know that his career is almost over because of lack of ethics, and more the girl he loves, a colleague, is going out with another of his colleagues. So what he decides to do? F***, rape his neighbor, kill his boss, turn into a slasher murderer, why not? We can easily tolerate that, even with some huge plot holes, but why, why does this movie turn into an unbelievable mess in the last 20 minutes? Why?The first half of the movie is pretty interesting, with amazing special effects that make the gorilla and Sebastian disappear. I see an Oscar nomination for them next year. After the man becomes bad there are some scenes that only Verhoeven has courage to do. The one where he rapes the hot neighbor is sick, but oddly interesting. The same thing I say about the one where he kills his boss. However, when everyone starts to die in the laboratory... it becomes just a mess. Too violent and disgusting, and totally unbelievable! Have you ever realize that the hero (in this case the girl) always have a brilliant idea when she is just dying (in this case inside a refrigerator). Of course the other hero who has been severely hurt comes to help her. And the worst the villain survives at least four times, even to an electric shock- and goes after the heroes! Borrowing the worst parts of DEEP BLUE SEA and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE! Why the hell do we need that??????? A film that was much above the average has to accept so many idiotic and cliched situations- why?????? HOLLOW MAN has an intriguing directing by Paul Verhoeven and, despite the not-so-smart dialogues, the actors do a fine job. Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue do what they can to save even the terrible ending.Even with so many disappointments all over it, HOLLOW MAN is still much better than some Hollywood productions. It is pretentious without being tedious, silly without being brainless, shocking without being unwatchable. But I advise you to leave before the last 20 minutes. You know what will happen, so don't waste your patience. You will have seen a good movie. Even with the self-destructive ending, it's still worth a look.

But it's not either a bad film like most of these reviews say. It's just a big budget movie about voyeurism. This theme is important in Verhoven's career (Basic Instinct) in this film it is more developed than in his other movies. The voyeur in Hollow Man is Sebastian Caine, his invisibility power push him to go far beyond his limits. At the beginning of the film he just looks  at his neighbor when he become invisible he has no limits and go and rape her. This is certainly the best treatment I've ever seen of the psychology of the invisible man, most of the old movies forgot that this was after all a naked man seeking to satisfy his fantasies. The film is provocative like most of Verhoven's films, there is this really funny and shocking scene in which Sebastian plays with Sarah Kennedy's breast while he's invisible! Well you'll never see a scene like that in any other film! The other good point in this film is the great use of astonishing special effects, you have never seen an invisible man so real on your screen, the effects are very important to the development of the story. There is nothing useless in a Verhoven film. The big deception is the ending where Sebastian keeps resurrecting like a slasher killer, and there's an explosion and an elevator falling&#133;Lot of bad stuffs that happen so fast one after the other, they menace to spoil the whole movie! I think this is not how Verhoven wanted his film to end, this bad ending was probably imposed by a stupid studio who just want to make some money!

His former American projects include such films as the sci-fi drama Robocop; the pseudo-intellectual suspense thriller Basic Instinct; and the sex-farce Showgirls. And now, we have Verhoeven's take on The Invisible Man. His Dutch work ranged from the literary, surrealistic thriller The Fourth Man to the stupid sex-comedy Wat Zien ik? 2. His movies are so slick, so Hollywood, but, hey, this guy's from Europe, so is he being sarcastic or something? Is he satirizing America or American cinema? 3. And then there's the way my fellow countryman deals with criticism. He defended Showgirls by childishly stating that it wasn't a sex-film, but a film ABOUT sex. Yet, he turned out to be a real sport who actually showed up at the Razzie-Awards to accept his trophy for Worst Film of the Year. And he constantly defends the shallowness of Hollow Man (Yeah, I know -- hardihar) by quoting Plato on the subject of invisibility.  I read several articles about this movie and it's difficult to say something original about it. Yes, there are lots of scientific and logical errors; Yes, there are quite a view continuity errors (the whole thing with those heat-detecting glasses was annoying -- for God's sake, just keep them on, dim the lights, and you've immediately swapped places with the invisible man); Yes, Verhoeven heavily relies on our willingness to suspend disbelief; yes, the whole concept of invisibility is extremely interesting, but little creativity is shown here. This could have been a great film about alienation (a Kafka's Metamorphosis for the year 2000). Instead, this is an update on the latest developments in special effect galore, and built around it is just a by the numbers plot about a killer who first enjoys his ability to get away with squeezing a few breasts (although this has more to do with the fact that his victims are sleeping rather than his invisibility) before somehow gaining superhuman powers and providing us with quite a few O, God, he ain't dead yet-shocks as the bloke still keeps getting up after being hit, burned, and electrocuted. Verhoeven's style is very slick. Slick direction; slick photography; and slick editing. Verhoeven's fast (yet never 'hip' or exhausting)pace always manages to drag me along. Yeah, I enjoyed the ride, especially since I saw it in a theatre that's well known for its top-notch sound-system (the great music and sound-fx made me jump out of my seat a few times -- I always like that).

Brian DePalma's Dressed to Kill',  Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy, and the recent Starship Troopers.  I was hoping Hollow Man, the update version of the classic Claude Rains' Invisible Man', might make the list, but this is just a plain bad film.  Neither Paul Verhoeven's macabre lessons in 'Gray's Anatomy' nor his over-the-top violence is enough to steer this film away from its awful stench.  The first scene introduces us to the stink factor as the seemingly benign but frustrated scientist (Kevin Bacon) yells out an expletive just as his computer simulation model collapses and his private view of a sexy stripping neighbor disappears behind the window blinds.  We soon see the buxomly Elisabeth Shue (a bit heavy since her Leaving Las Vegas days), awakened in the middle of the night from a seemingly sound sleep, looking as if she had just had a complete facial makeover.  In a pivotal fight at the end, the badly impaled hero (Josh Brolin) comes back to life looking no worse for wear, fighting to save his girl inside an elevator shaft even as the menacing elevator makes repeats runs up and down.  And how could we forget the female breast being suckled, the pool of deliberately spilled red blood on the floor to remind us this really is a violent movie, the rather tasteless joke about Superman, Wonderwoman, and the Invisible Man, and the rather peculiar line, 'all in the name of science', mouthed by our would-be hero (Bacon) as he exposes himself to his female co-workers. Lest you think there is anything original about this film, you only have to see the gadgetry tracking the mad scientist or the step by step elimination of the crew members to know Hollow Man is really an Alien disguise.  Whereas in Alien, there were strong actors (Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm) to back up the demure Ms. Weaver, in Hollow Man, neither Josh Brolin nor Kim Dickens have any stage presence nor conviction.  Kevin Bacon will never frighten anyone as long as he has that winsome smile and Ms. Shue's only redemption here is that she chose not to go topless.

In the second place the special effects and the third the story and keyplayers. Only my second reason was completely fullfilled, the other reasons certainly not.  What didn't I like about the film 1) The very very hollow story; 2) The film was overpredictable; 3) The last 40 minutes was very awful (the film went from a SF-movie to a horror and die-hard-movie); 4) The acting certainly was not extraordinary;  5) I especially missed Paul Verhoeven's touch in this film (raw sexscenes (except the tittysqueezing of course), splatter- action, Verhoeven's criticism about for instance American society, a clear message so to speak); 6) Not everything was explained clearly in the film. Like why did Sebastian go mad (what sort of substance in the invisibility serum for instance did effect Sebastian's mind). What did I like about the film 1) The special effects (excellent!!!!!!), even better maybe than in The Matrix; 2) The first hour, an excellent opening; 3) Elizabeth Shue; 4) Some camera-use reminded me of an old classic, namely Halloween (and Child's Play); 5) The music was great (Jerry, Jerry).Overall I'll give this movie a 6,5 out of a 10, no more. Starship Troopers was way better than this film. Anyway, I hope Verhoeven's next film will be less commercial as this one was.

I already knew i was in trouble when i realized Josh Brolin was trying to act and was barely clinging to the thin script. Now i realize this should be considered a fun dumb turn your brain off type film but guess what ?. I'M TIRED OF THOSE TYPES OF FILM !. Being as it was from the director of Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers; i didn't except it to be all that good right from the start. But i was curious, and i'd heard raves about the effects, and well i was bored and wanted to see a movie. Kevin Bacon described working on this film as a nightmare but i wonder if he realized how bad it would be sitting in the audience ?. Poor Kevin. Poor Elisabeth Shue. Poor Paul Verhoven. I genuinely feel sorry for them having to have their names attached to this type of cliche ridden, tiresome, big-blow up pile of nothingness. Actually i feel sorry for Hollywood in general. I have faith that eventually audiences will wise up and STOP paying to see films like this. I hope. Now onward i go to the scene that really got me contemplating the exciting world that is my navel  Shue and Brolin get tossed into a cold storage room by the psychotic Sebastian Caine and well needless to say they have to escape and save the day, and kill the bad guy, and generally make the audience wet themselves with glee. I won't comment on the WAY Shue escapes from the room but isn't it amazing how the good guys (but are they really good guys ?) manage to always have the equipment at their fingertips to allow an easy escape ?. What i wish to comment on is when Shue takes Brolin's hand and tells him to stay awake, hold on. I honestly excepted Celine Dion to break the scene with her shattering caterwaul and horrify us with a power balled. Now that would have been scary. That would have brought the audience to the edge of their seats ... to leave the theatre i assume. Anyhow ... go at your own risk dear movie goer.

The invisible man is visible while draped in rain, wrapped in smoke, or immeresed in water.  (POSSIBLE SPOILER) In the most memorable scene from the film, a gorilla is scene disappear and reappear, right down the pumping organs and veins. The multi-million dollar special effects are definitely in top form here, so why on Earth couldn't a few more dollars have been spent trying to write a better script?Hollow Man lives up to its name in two ways Kevin Bacon's character is hollow, and so is the plot a tacked-on affair, invisible-man-goes-insane, and paper-thin characters. Let's crank up the visuals and f*** the story seems to be the general consensus of the film, and it does not click at all.The first half of the film is well-done, showing the basic invisibility premise and Bacon's initial reaction.  The second half, however, somehow turns into your standard slasher picture, with Bacon hunting down each member of his team in a small, enclosed place.  The gore is not the problem at all; in fact, the most disturbing scene is a dog smashed against a cage violently.  But the story - what's that, you say? Friday the 13th? Sleepaway Camp?  That's right; the story is right along with that drek. And just as is the fashion of such slasher flicks, the killer is damn-near invincible - Bacon is and beat up, burned, electrocuted, and cracked on the head with a crowbar,yet gets up in a matter of minutes, rarin' to go. What on Earth is going on here? Did the invisibility serum also make him a not only a hollow man, but also a superman?If you don't mind a storyline reminiscient of such horror fodder, then you'll no doubt love seeing Kevin Bacon killing all in his path.  If you're looking for a heady, smart thriller, try Verhoven's earlier offerings.5 out of 10  "},{"Title":"Kevin Bacon ain't no Claude Rains","Date":"27 August 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The classic version of H G Wells' The Invisible Man made Claude Raines a star, even though you only saw him briefly. His portrayal of a man deranged by the ultimate power of invisibility is one of the best in SF films.In Hollow Man, Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Cain, a brilliant research scientist working on a Defense Department project making a man invisible, then returning him to normal. They've got the first part down invisible dogs and apes fill the empty cages around the lab.When Sebastian finds a way to restore a gorilla to visibility (in one of the cool FX scenes), he wants to immediately jump to Phase 3 human trials.  And, of course, he will be the guinea pig.But Sebastian didn't think about what it means to give up all his control to his research staff.  He quickly gets tired of being under surveillance all the time, and wants to get involved with things.Just how involved and what things I won't say.Bacon does as well as can be expected with a thin script. The set-ups are fairly obvious for this reason, and the last half of the movie ends up being predictable.Two and a half stars. Uncle Steve says wait for it to hit the dollar house.  It's worth a couple of bucks, but it ain't worth event the price that Ballbuster video will charge you in a month or two. "},{"Title":"Hi, kids!  Today's word is insipid","Date":"27 August 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  We just got back from seeing this movie, and our reaction, in a word, is Wow.  The special effects are very impressive (the scene of a fully mature gorilla appearing cell by cell and corpuscle by corpuscle certainly raised my eyebrows), and the action sequences kept the story going, but unfortunately, there wasn't much of a story to maintain.  This took science fiction into the realm of movie magic, with so many liberties taken with natural laws they are too numerous to list completely, but here are a few choice samples (spoiler warning!!)-- Not much detail on how they make him invisible (some mention of unstable DNA sequences and quantum shifting, concepts from two completely unrelated fields -- is there something biological which makes him invisible, or is it optical physics?  Who knows?-- Why use an animal twice your size for a serum which could affect the mental stability of the subject?  Instead of a gorilla, another simian such as a rhesus monkey would do.-- If you're standing in a puddle of water and the guy next to you shoves a crowbar into an electrical distribution panel and electrocutes himself, shouldn't you dance the light fantastic right along with him?-- The laboratory explodes with an enormous fireball, yet (of course) our hero and heroine don't get singed, the fire doesn't produce any smoke inside the elevator shaft they're trapped inside until they stumble out into the light of day probably half an hour later, it doesn't even touch the invisible man (who apparently is fireproof, too), tosses an elevator car casually up at them, to come to rest (conveniently enough) inches above them, and the pressure wave from the explosion doesn't even pop their ears.-- Oh, yeah, and how about that explosion?  The nitroglycerine Caine cooked up was in a centrifuge with a timer on it... okay, I'll push the I believe button on that one, but in all the labs I've worked in, centrifuges are powered by AC... so even though the control console was wrecked, what stopped them from UNPLUGGING IT??Aside from the fact that I've always had a hard time envisioning Elizabeth Shue as a scientist (her role as a particle physicist in The Saint was bad enough), this is just a glossy summer blockbuster heavy on budget and light on substance, where dedicated, workaholic eggheads still seem to squeeze enough time in their busy schedules to work out regularly, get a tan, and ensure their hair is perfectly coifed.  In addition, the screenwriter neatly sidesteps all the ethical issues and moral dilemmas that could and should have interrupted the story long enough to give everyone pause and make them reconsider their actions.  Add to that a certain breast fixation, and you've got all the makings of a movie that appeals to the twelve year olds in the audience, but to anyone with half a brain and more than an eighth grade education, this will be a waste of time and money.  The Sci-Fi Channel's Invisible Man series is better done with probably half the budget.  Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue do what they can to keep the audience interested, but even they can't save this ship.  Bottom line wait till it comes out on video... and let someone else pay for it.

"},{"Title":"Unfortunately crippled masterpiece","Date":"26 August 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Paul Verhoeven belongs to the group of Hollywood authors that try hard to widen the expectations and criteria of the audience.Sadly,the industry isn`t always ready to support such intentions.The movies became too expensive and studios do a lot of formulaic pics just to be sure that they`ll get their money back.Verhoeven managed to avoid such studio limitations in his movies.Maybe because Hollywood owes so much to the `Crazy Dutch`? Verhoeven defined the legacy of the modern Hollywood.With `RoboCop` he made the ultimate action SF comic-book cross-over that has a large ammount of satire.`Total Recall` turned the action SF mould into a new shape e.g. plotty scripts with twists were the written backing for energetic visceral action.Check `Total Recall` once again these days- look how Verhoeven made it,dig how he shot Scwarzenegger,try to imagine seeing such a movie today (in the year 2000)...They simply don`t make movies like that anymore.`Basic Instinct` shaped the form of the postmodern erotic thriller.This genre has the greatest representative in this movie.The picture turned this genre into a potent moneymaking well for the studios.At the same time `Basic Instinct` launched Sharon Stone into stardom that was exclusively built on this Verhoven pic (remember that Sharon failed to repeat such commercial or pop-cultural success afterwards). With `Starship Troopers` Verhoeven ventured into the deeply intellectual vein of his Hollywood career.This movie was an explicit satire of the American civilisation.Verhoeven`s stylish direction made it look like a straight `gung ho`war movie but there were layers of subversion beneath.Even Ed Neumeier`s script failed to remain straight faced all the way-it went spoofy toward the climax.This movie flopped on the box-office but it also developed a strong fandom.Unfortunately most of the fans liked the pic because of Verhoeven`s energetic staging of battles.Only a minority understood how important and perverse was a movie where TV actors in Nazi uniforms blow bugs away. `Hollow Man` followed.It was released in a season when De Palma,Woo and Zemeckis made weak films.Movie buffs around the world wandered if one great era was drawing to a close.But then `Hollow Man` hit the screens. In `Hollow Man` Verhoeven is as vital as ever.This time he tackles the myth of the Invisible Man(that was initially invented by H.G.Wells). This mythology is great since it provides the author with limitless opportunities.It also easily uncovers author`s obsessions (I mean Wes Craven`s Invisible Man would be different from Sam Mendes`).This review will be full of spoilers but you are already familiar with the most of those plotlines and this movie is so great that you should see it neverminding the knowledge about the story. In Verhoeven`s `Hollow Man` the invisible guy is the monster.So if you take a simple look into the movie you can define it as the monster pic. The monster is opposed to heroes.The only Verhoeven`s touch is that monster isn`t too bad and heroes ain`t no good. The monster is scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon),a pure genius that invented invisibility serum.Heroes are his ex-girlfriend Linda and his friend Matt (who is also Linda`s current lover) who are also scientists (but underachievers compared to Sebastian).Sebastian is sexually frustrated but not in the sense of not getting any.He simply isn`t getting what he deserves (Sebastian is a much better guy than his ex-lover`s present boyfriend) so audience emphatizes with him.When he goes invisible he a)solves his sexual frustration (being in peace with your sexual instinct is extremely important said late Sigmund Freud) b)fights for his life and for `what he is` e.g.he kills officials and colleagues that try to eliminate him.While performing this he sins but overall he just tries to scratch his itches.Actually the pic is set as a fight between classy,decadent intellectual (Hollow Man) and his dumber friends that have a chance to obey in `melting pot` America. The described setting of `the monster` that isn`t so bad and the mentally inferior heroes seems kinky for some 80-million summer movies. Verhoeven turns this picture into a landmark when he deploys all the idiomatic solutions of dialogue in the script.For example,the typical `come fight me like a man`line get a new flavour when it is being said by a mediocre person that covers the shallowness with dogmatic justice. Why would classy scientist like Caine accept this dumb challenge? I am not saying that this line doesn`t work.It is actually great but Verhoeven changes its tone by twisting the character set-up.When John McClane says that in `Die Hard` it is the symbol of the true American valor.In `Hollow Man` it is the symbol of a dumb guy trying to out-muscle the genius. Verhoeven also uncovers the Hollywood manipulation with Christianity. Like in every monster movie heroes here whine about Godless nature of science.Most of these accusations are true but in `Hollow Man` heroes use this to simply cover their inabilty to think and invent like Caine.Most of the Godless nature of science in movies is connected to the cabalist myth of Golem. With this character manipulation Verhoeven aims the foundings of America-the movies.Let`s be real-people around the world see America only through movies.I can bet that most young and literate people around the globe know more about New York than about any town in their own fatherland.Well,this time Verhoeven messed with the powerful and influential institution of the Hollywood Movie.He showed how a talented and smart author can reinvent cliches. `Hollow Man` script floated the Web for a long time.It was written by Andrew W.Marlowe (Air Force One,End of Days)and based on a story by Scott E.Anderson.Anyone who read the script sees that the studio and the MPAA messed with the picture.Even one early AICN review showed that the first 150-minute cut packed more punch than any recent release (the movie is 114 minutes long). Apparently MPAA have left out the kinky and explicit parts while studio retooled the movie by re-editing it in order to make Caine a pure but `by the numbers` villain.Thus they jeopardized the integrity of Verhoeven`s vision. Author`s direction is as stylish as ever.Verhoeven makes every smart viewer feel like a kid in the candy store and the use of CGI really creates the sense of awe and wonder. Kevin Bacon did a great job.His role was a tough one since he isn`t visible for the most of the time.That`s why he had to achieve the illusion and expression only with his voice.Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin are great as an annoying couple of dogmatic underachievers that bond through averageness.If you look for hero quality in their roles you`re off the mark. `Hollow Man` has flaws that are imposed by the studio and the MPAA.But if I don`t claim it to be a masterpiece I would betray the joy I felt watching it.

After seeing the previews I was hoping for a good mix of impressive special effects and a thrilling storyline - Instead I see impressive special effects and not a whole lot more.The transformation of Kevin Bacon and the gorilla is very impressive - but it does not save this dud. The acting is bad. I think that Kevin Bacon's character was poorly used - He wasn't likable to start with and then suddenly goes from Arrogant and Annoying to Raving Blood thirsty killer.Sure, there is a couple of bare chests here and there, but they are really quite pointless, the scene where Bacon's character, while invisible, manages to undo the shirt and take out the breast of the vet character is really completely unnecessary - as is his topless neighbour, who seemingly couldn't even land a line in the movie.This film actually reminds me a lot of another bad film I wasted my money on, Deep Blue Sea. A group of scientists do an experiment that goes wrong, they get trapped, the experiment sets out to kill them, a stream of pointless characters are killed - hell, they even had a very similar elevator shaft scene,(I'm not certain it was an Elevator shaft in Deep Blue Sea but it was something similar) except in Deep Blue Sea it was water not Fire.It became a bit of a slasher style movie in the end - lots of blood and violent killing.A few (well a lot more than a few really) questions remain from this movie -Why didn't setting him on fire burn or kill him ?Why didn't the others get electrocuted when they were standing in water ?What the hell was the point of killing the dog ? (I thought that was just tasteless)How did he climb up the elevator shaft after the explosion ?Why did they bother to split up ?, then even more stupidly remove their heat goggles ?and the biggest question of them all...WHERE DID THE SUPER HUMAN STRENGTH COME FROM ?To sum up -Impressive Special Effects (mostly featured in the previews)Bad ActingBad ScriptAwful Plot (more holes than Beneath the Planet of the Apes)Pointless Nudity and ViolenceDon't Waste your money.2/10  "},{"Title":"Routine effects thriller improved by Elisabeth Shue","Date":"26 August 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I didn't care what this movie was about, who made it, or how good or bad it looked.

Second, there was no basic logic as to what can actually be very, very dangerous. The scientists - apparent as well as transparent - survive minor medical problems like massive bloodloss, electric shock, and, of course, being terribly bombed and burned at the same time (Hand me that shock/heat/fire-wave, will you dear?).

Dear Paul Verhoeven, as I wrote earlier, I´m a devoted fan of your scifi-work. But you never could direct erotic scenes - they get sterile. Watch Il Postino and Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow, before you shoot your next scenes with beautiful women. And then maybe you can make my pulse rise. Oh, and by the way, find a screenwriter who can make the erotic scenes fit the script - it shouldn´t be like Playboy Horror Late Night.I´m pleased to announce though that effects and cinematography were from the top drawer as usual.

You see, a vast number of Americans believe that the bible is a moral code, when in reality it is only a document stating do this and that or some big scary omniscent monster will get you. Hollow Man is an excellent exploration of what happens to a man with subjective morals when such pseudo-moral restraints, in this case the fear of being caught, are removed. In effect, Sebastian IS the god of the bible, figuratively speaking, simply because he has no need to answer for his actions.However, Paul Verhoeven works best with a good screenwriter, as Robocop and Total Recall have proven. Andrew Marlowe is only a good screenwriter at the best of times, and it is a credit to Verhoeven that the first 100 minutes of the film is as good as it is. In the last twenty minutes, however, Marlowe lapses too far into trying to please the Christian American audience, and also loses any idea of how to effectively wrap up the story. If he had simply written one special climax with a sense of irony, Hollow Man would be a perfect 10 in my view. However, the lapse into Air Force One mode means I have to downgrade my rating to a respectable 8. Six points for the first 100 minutes of the story, with two added on for the special effects, which are the best I have seen in years when you talk about integration with the story, as well Verhoeven's fearless direction. This film takes all the previous Invisible Man films and uses them as toilet paper. Don't let the scorn of those who are not capable of understanding what the film was really about put you off.

However, Hollow Man is Verhoeven's weakest sci/fi effort though it's not his worst film (Showgirls has that honor). Hollow Man starts off in the right direction with a team of scientists doing invisibility experiments on animals. They test a serum on one of the animals that brings that animal back to normal. Then one of the scientists (Kevin Bacon) decides to try the invisibility experiment on himself. The stuff that makes him invisible works, but the stuff that makes him normal doesn't. As time keeps passing by and the longer he stays invisible, he proceeds to turn into a raving madman. The first half of Hollow Man is dynamite. The special effects scenes when the animal reappears and when Bacon turns invisible are impressive. But it turns real nasty in the second half when the movie turns into a slasher film. Verhoeven once again has to display graphic violence like in his other films. The last 30 minutes of Hollow Man was especially hard to endure. I think this film would have had a better second half if they had stuck with the idea of finding a serum that would have brought Bacon back from being invisible. Another thing in Hollow Man that was kind of ridiculous was all the sexuality and nudity (another Verhoeven specialty). One scene that was really annoying was the one where the invisible scientist enters a neighbor's apartment without her knowing it (how can she know if he's invisible) and proceeds to do you know what. Isn't it about time Verhoeven made a movie without graphic violence, sex, and nudity? I doubt that will ever happen. Nevertheless, there are things to like in Hollow Man. The special effects are an asset, and Elisabeth Shue, one of my favorite actresses, is very good as a fellow scientist who happens to be a former girlfriend of Bacon. I was just disappointed that Hollow Man concluded as a missed opportunity.**1/2 (out of four)  "},{"Title":"Unbelievable!

The man who has brought us such diverse classics as Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Showgirls, delivers to us Hollow Man, a strange mixture of the three.Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team of scientists have discovered the secret of invisibility.  The movie looks like it is over before it has begun!  But no, the problem they have is not making someone invisible, but getting them back to normal afterwards.After finally bringing an ape back to normal using the new formula devised by Caine, he pushes the project to Phase 3; tests on human beings.  He volunteers himself for the process, and that is where the fun begins.You see, the new formula to bring him back doesn't appear to work, so the team has to come up with something new.But they don't get much time to do so, cause the invisibility caper is affecting Kane's mind somewhat.  He starts off by just having some fun with his newfound invisibility, getting a closer look at the sexy neighbour he has always had his eye on, and playing with the minds of the scientific team just a bit.But apparently invisibility unhinges the mind a little, and he gets a bit more energetic with his activities...Hollow Man is a competent, if medically gruesome tale that keeps the attention for its 100 minute length.  I said it was a curious mixture of previous Paul Verhoeven films, and it is.  It has the suspense of Total Recall, the voyerism of Showgirls and the tension of Basic Instinct.The supporting cast on the whole is quite competent, Josh Brolin is fine, and Elisabeth Shue is OK as the the scientific team supporting Kevin Bacon.The all pervasive score by Jerry Goldsmith however is a hinderence to enjoying the film.The main talking point of the film, the special effects, are very well realised.  It was very hard to pick a fault with the numerous invisibility shots.  My only complaint was that there were too many of them, too many contrived situations created to show off the talents of the special effects team.Hollow Man was however, good solid entertainment and well worth a look.8 ouf of 10.

What he shows is horrible, but he doesn't convey any sense of horror, its almost gleeful.  Kevin Bacon starts out as a horrible man and becomes, well, a horrible man.  There is not one redeeming factor for this character, well he is indestructible (almost). This movie was boring and pointless directed by a man who is beginning to become very decadent in his directing, but it has no point.

But. here's what will really have you coiling in your seat in fear a collection of some of the worst dialogue perhaps ever conceived since the invention of the talking picture. Add a few ugly, ludicrous nudity scenes and depictions of cruelty to animals - I don't care if it's fake, it's damn repulsive to watch in any film - which immediately lose points off the board. Not to mention a tired plot (if a mess like this could be described as such), and 1-dimensional characters for effect.But what really tops this cake is an incredibly sordid and silly ending that had me shaking my head, and that's something I haven't done in a long time, not even during Gone in Sixty Seconds.All this, my friends, makes for a movie as transparent as its title.Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is an egomaniacal, disputatious scientist with an annoying God complex who volunteers to be the first human experiment of a special invisibility serum that has proved successful on a cranky gorilla named Isabelle (pretty much a ripoff of Congo, a film I enjoyed - don't laugh) and many other lab animals.  Sure enough - you guessed it - the production goes awry, and he's stuck in his invisible state for awhile.The film moved with the speed of a banana slug up to this point.  Does it get any better following the botched experiment?  The answer is a resounding No.The special effects showing the serum working its way through the body of both man and gorilla are indeed impressive, although looking at graphic beating hearts and Bacon writhing maniacally in the buff on the gurney, as if he were lying in a bed of porcupine quills, rendered me queasy in a short time. Then again, that was probably the filmmakers' desired effect in the first place.The invisibility potion has apparently jacked up Caine's sexual fantasies to overdrive, and he decides to take advantage of his unseen state by attempting to cop a peek at a coworker's chest.  Does she tell anyone? Of course not, because that would make too much sense.  This is followed by an appalling sequence, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot, involving a woman who conveniently lives in the building across from Caine's and looks like she just stepped off the cover of a Victoria's Secret catalog.  She, as any of us would, gets undressed every night with blinds up, lights on and breasts at full blast.  Then again, what's a Paul Verhoeven film without those chest heaving sessions?  Silly me. He's probably the Russ Meyer of today.and that's not a compliment.Suddenly, the invisible Caine inexplicably transforms into a transparent serial killer, for no known reason (those darn plot details again!), thus launching an attempt to kill his cohorts.  Watch for the one who is dispatched first - this is in pretty poor taste.  This movie degenerates into yet another yawner of a slasher film.Then there's the dialogue.  Ah, yes.  Every verbal cliché is in full force here, hurled relentlessly at the audience like machine gun fire, from the reliable Don't you die on me! to the classic wailing of No!! as a character falls from a high distance.He'll be all right! and He needs blood! are said, with straight faces, no less, by two scientists after one of their friends is reduced to a gory, gasping heap in a lab. Elisabeth Shue, who pretty much winds up carrying the movie in a thankless performance, doesn't get off any easier  (You think you're God? I'll show you God!).When another worker is injured by Caine, her reaction is priceless It didn't cut any organs.Apparently the word logic is not in the vocabulary of screenwriter Andrew Marlowe (probably the idiot that included the Wonder Woman joke in the script) either.  In the beginning, a scientist's hand is chomped by the invisible gorilla.  Does he seek medical attention? Nope, instead he engages in a ten-spot wager with Caine on who can be the first to KO the beast with a tranquilizer.The supporting cast, especially a cardboard Josh Brolin, is hard to swallow as respectable scientists; I felt as if I was watching The Breakfast Club Goes to The Pentagon.By making Bacon unlikable from the start, sympathy for his character is completely out of the question. Then again, could anyone sympathize with a sex maniac who utters choice expletives every time Ms. Victoria's Secret closes her blinds after stripping down to her underwear?But nothing will prepare you for the lunacy of the ending. Predictably, Caine manages to cheat death after being attacked in various and sundry ways (describing them here can't do it justice), which leads up to a corny, less-than-thrilling showdown in an elevator shaft - where, I learned, you can survive a raging fire.as long as the flames don't touch you.  Oh, and show me someone who can suffer a serious injury, then hang from cables and come darting out of a building afterwards while EMTs waiting outside in ambulances don't seem to notice.Just how many rounds could those tranquilizer guns hold anyway? The infrared glasses are a hoot.maybe the actors were so bored by this celluloid tripe that they decided to engage in Lazer Tag between takes.For all of Hollow Man's silliness, perhaps the scariest part is what Verhoeven (who brought us such luminaries as Robocop, Showgirls and Basic Instinct) will do next to top this crapfest. You can't suspend your disbelief to enjoy this; you'll have to kill it outright. One thing's for sure you'll probably never look at duct tape the same way again for awhile.That's all for now.I have to run because I just heard an explosion. 3/10  "}{"Title":"Great effects but a stock horror story","Date":"20 August 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  If you're a lover of special effects Hollow man is a must see.

A group of government-funded scientists have created a way to make living things invisible (for whatever reason is vague). They give the treatment to one of their own. He goes nuts. Etc. There are only two action sequences that take place outside the lab-- one is a sexual assault that is never referred to again for the rest of the film (evidence of heavy post-production cutting here), and the murder of a character who we could see was going to die from the moment he stepped onto the screen.

They run around the lab acting like the cast from Friends, spurting out cute Gen-X dialogue and casually discussing their sex lives. There is not a single moment in the entire movie where I was convinced that the Pentagon would actually hire these professionals to work on a top-secret experiment. Elizabeth Shue (who deservedly got billing above Kevin Bacon, who brings no life to the Invisible Man role) and Josh Brolin scamper around like a football player and a cheerleader trying not to get caught behind the bleachers.

Major flaws indeed, but flaws that could have easily been repaired.  One could easily blame Verhoeven himself, but close inspection of the film reveals several glimmers of potential insight that give one the hope that this is merely another example of High-Budget Hollywood Hijinx. This is one of the films that I long to see the original script for, to see how much on-screen was films execs utilizing their standard High-Budget sci-fi Special-Effects Extravaganza Formula (I find it hard to believe that screenwriters across the country are all convinced that what their big finale really needs is yet another big explosion).  The movie starts with a glimmer of hope, but the ending devolves into yet another Aliens wanna-be (`My God, we're locked in here with the monster/creature/alien/madman/senator, and there is nowhere to run, therefore we must track down and defeat our slippery foe!') where the cast you've failed to gain any real affection for is slaughtered one by one in unique and interesting ways.  It is the ultimate insult, that H. G. Wells' classic sci-fi tale of man's inherent evil has been reborn as an expensive hack & slash horror film.  I have nothing against hack & slash, mind you.  But there is a time and a place for everything, and this was neither the time nor the place. Not that I'm arguing against the film's depictions of violence, despite that fact that the film degenerates to the point where characters are actually throwing bags of plasma around the room in a cheap attempt to get as much blood as possible without too much MPAA approved violence.  On the contrary, the films opening scene alone had a brutality and vividness to it that gave rise to my expectations (which were soon to be dashed against the rocks of a cheesy Hollywood ending).  It effectively depicted the danger and foreboding of an unseen aggressor, like an extreme case of Fearing the Unknown.I've also found people who complained, not that the film was violent, but that it was vulgar. Yes, it seems that Kevin Bacon makes up for his lack of nudity in Stir Of Echoes (The Rev Rates It 8) by showing as much Bacon Behind as possible. In fact, voyeurism becomes (or should have become) a major theme of the film, and not just through the aspect of an invisible man spying unawares.  The parallel to the `Peeping Tom' aspect is the growing concern with the other scientists with not only seeing the invisible scientist, but constantly monitoring him as well. As for main character, in this case he is weak because he leaves little room for dramatic development.  Sebastian Caine's descent into madness isn't as much a plummet as it is a hop from the curb.  The head scientist is an egomaniacal, manipulative, frustrated workaholic.  Gee, lets give the power of invisibility and see if it corrupts him.  Instead of giving the film yet another form of Instant Evil (just add unlimited power, and watch your Chia Villain grow!), so much more could have been said about man's nature by corrupting the soul of someone you wouldn't expect to turn on his fellow man. The double-meaning title of the film itself pointed in the proper direction, yet failed to follow.  Hollow Man not only referred to the eerie sight of seeing through the eye holes of a mask to the back of the head, or of clothing encompassing nothing as if a hollow shell.  It also referred to Sebastian Caine, a `Hollow Man' containing nothing within but shallow desires and relentless hunger for power.  While there are moments where this is eluded too, the film goes off on other little diatribes that detract from this, losing its real strength by trying to appear more involved than it allowed itself to be. In the end Hollow Man became a Hollow Film.  It starts off showing the promise of a truly inventive film with a brain as well as a soul, and winds up as nothing more than another schlock sci-fi/thriller effects extravaganza with nothing to say but `Boo' and `Kablam'! And that, dear viewer, is the true horror.

So since we know that Kevin Bacon is a scientist that becomes invisible after being injected with some sort of magical potion I'll say that's not the problem I have.  What annoys me most about books and movies is when a character goes berserk with no motive whatsoever.  Yes, if I was a scientist whose Invisible Man project wasn't going quite as planned I'd be frustrated, but this movie gives it grounds to become a serial killer.  How did he ever make it through medical school?  Surely some of the rigorous testing would have made him burst.  Or maybe he's just one of people who take a lickin' and keep on a tickin'.  Whatever it is, I don't buy it.And maybe I would be able to look over some of this if it didn't make Kevin Bacon some sort of supernatural being also.  The movie never said anything about the potion making him able to withstand being torched, electrocuted while drenching wet, beat with crowbars, and falling down elevator shafts.

The movie makes some attempt to imply that invisibility affects the brain and makes creatures aggressive, but Bacon's character doesn't do anything while invisible that he wouldn't have done while visible, if he could get away with it. They just don't do very much in this movie.  All the action could have taken place in an hour-long TV episode, and that's what it feels like.  The action is confined to few locations without having any atmosphere (as compared to Alien, which was similarly confined but that added to the tension).Most importantly, this movie cannot be seen except in the context of Adam Rifkin's (as Rif Coogan) Invisible Maniac.  If you haven't seen it, look it up now!  It is also about a scientist who goes crazy after injecting an invisibility serum, and in fact the opening voyeuristic shots of Hollow Man are very similar to the opening of Invisible Maniac.

If you stay, everything the rest of the film has spent building will fall flat.This movie could have been the best movie I've seen in awhile if it had stayed realistic until the end.  Granted, we're talking about invisible people.  The problem with the story is that it loses it's realism.  You can ask the audience to suspend believability for one thing, and still keep a realistic story.  Say for instance, the technological discovery of a way to make people invisible.  As long as you handle it realistically throughout the film, you'll do fine.  But the Problem with Hollow Man is because they suspended reality for one thing, they think they can get away with trying to suspend all sorts of other realities, which is when it starts to play like a Hollywood flick.  I mean, how believable is that someone could get torched... repeatedly... over the whole body... and then smashed over the head with crow bar, and still be able to walk around and fight, or climb up ladders.  Or how believable is that someone could be mortally impaled in the stomach by a crowbar, left in a freezer for several minutes where the temperature drops well below zero, and still be able to fight someone else only minutes later.  Once Elizabeth Shue magically realizes that she doesn't have to die because she can rig a Mission Impossiblesque contraption, the movie starts to suck hard.So, flashback up to the top of this comment, when this was still a good movie.   Imagine with me, a new ending.  An ending that would have made this movie one of the finest this summer.

A tear rolls down her cheek and turns to ice(at wich point, she would start to get frostbite on her extremities, as would Josh Brolin).  Meanwhile, Kevin Bacon is making himself look nice and palatable, almost human. He walks into the main chamber, makes an incredibly powerful bomb, sets the timer, goes up the elevator, jumps in his car and as he's speeding away into the sunset, the place goes up in flames.  Bad ass, Kevin Bacon, is now truly free to have all the power he wants.  Not only does that ending kick ass all by itself, it also allows for sequels.

The believability of this picture is destroyed even before one enters the theater.  The idea of an invisible man is so far fetched and cliched that it seems ridiculous to reiterate the concept in a film.  However, it is done craftfully and tactfully.  The suspension of disbelief lies not in the concept of turning invisible - which would have been overly done, lame in general, and wouldn't have helped the suspension of disbelief - instead, it is with the concept of reversion back to visibility.  By using a psychological door in the face, the film takes the viewer just deep enough to get them settled in and not throw the concept of invisibility out the door.  They take for granted the larger of the two concepts is accepted, an interesting twist on typical approaches to science fiction.Kevin Bacon does a fine job as, as aforementioned in previous comments, an egotistical scientist with an acute personality;  a lot more realistic than most of us would like to believe.  Whether or not we like him is mostly irrelevant;  Elizabeth Shue is really the main character.  The script does a satisfactory job in establishing Bacon's character for later in the film.Once things go awry, the film slowly builds, Kevin Bacon doing things which at first seem playful, and then slowly degrading and finally horrifying. His aggression and slip of morality are done in a believable way, and the film does indeed play off of the what if idea, which no film of its type has ever done.  Most of the time, you find characters in horror films acting ridiculously, restraining themselves in a moral fashion just so that the audience can identify them, or putting themselves in ridiculous situations in which they are bound to fail.  Not in a Verhoeven film.  The people are treated as average, with an equal capacity for corruption, aggression, and stupidity as could be expected from normal beings.Having Bacon go out into the world more or pursue different interests would have been the worst direction the film could have taken.  The writer knew more than to create this type of scenario, and hence did not let it happen. The film would have become ridiculous and would have had to have relied on incredible plot convenience to keep the movie alive.  Instead, working within possibly the only boundaries to keep the film going strong, Hollow Man turns into a suspense film.   This is truly what the film was building towards all along and provided for a great climax.Near the end, although the violence is realistic (people actually bleed and lie down in pain when hit, un-like most R and below films these days), there are several scenes which stretch the bounds of believability.  Namely, the ones where Bacon is attacked.  The film justifies this through the aggression and adrenaline that insanity lends, but it does stretch certain things just a bit too far.  Nevertheless, such actions and climactical cliches I think were, in this case, called for.  The end of the film was quite exciting and incorporated some of the best special effects in the entire picture.  As usual, Verhoeven is aptly able to keep you on the edge of your seat.In sum, although this film was not the epic of Total Recall or Starship Troopers, it was a good, solid suspense film that explored an old concept in a new, creative way.

This film is both a thriller and a special effects show, as the two lend into each other.Scientist Sebastian Cain (Kevin Bacon) has discovered the secret of invisibility.  Anxious to test his breakthrough on a human instead of the usual laboratory animal, he volunteers to be the first invisible (Hollow?) man.  At first Sebastian plays a few obvious pranks, then gets naughty, and finally goes crazy and attempts to kill all of his peers. The special effects in this film certainly are top notch.  Never before has an invisible man been portrayed as realistically via special effects as in Hollow Man.  The developed story and characters surprised me, as special effects movies tend to lack in those areas.  To put the question to rest, Hollow Man features the breasts of two of it's actresses.  Fortunately enough, the more comely actress has more onscreen breast time. I enjoyed the movie experience Hollow Man left me with.  Though movie watchers should know that Hollow Man is a special effects film first, it packs a surprisingly satisfactory script.  Thumbs up and three stars.

It is very reminiscent of Deep Blue Sea for some reason, maybe the fooling with nature and it backfiring, i dunno. Anyway, I can understand his thing with doing things to women while invisible, any man would. I draw the line when you see him feel up a woman's breast on screen while she is sleeping. Supposedly this woman has been on the project for some months, so why would he do this to a woman he knows, and she wakes up with her shirt unbuttoned and doesn't tell anyone!!!!. That was the first night he was invisible too, he wasn't even fully crazy yet, and he just snaps, there is nothing leading up to his craziness, and he has no problem trying to kill his past love. He also seems very super hero like at the end, he just doesn't seem to die, and then you don't really see him die, you see him kind of fall into the flames. It was a good movie, just excessive nudity that doesn't even fit the story line, which bugs me. It had some memorable moments, when they are bringing the gorilla back from Invisiblitly, and putting him into invisibility. But the whole thing fell on it's face near the end with some huge plot holes, like how does he get up on top of the elevator if the nukes went through the whole place!, and the girl in the freezer is too McGuyver like, seriously, who really has the strength to pull the wires out of defibulator paddles without grunting or showing any kind of sign that it took some strength. The whole thing falls flat at the end but is a good ride.  Overall it was good and will become a classic because of the special effects, even though they weren't that advanced, they still looked cool, it was all just some ingenious green screening that's all, smoke and mirrors.  _-_Erlog_-_  "},{"Title":"Hollow Director","Date":"9 August 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Imagine for a moment that you are a brilliant scientist who has just discovered a serum that makes you invisible.

The story doesn't make much sense because it starts to fall apart after about an hour into the movie, but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat. **SPOILER ALERT** The movie was well directed, until the ending. Making Kevin Bacon die was just not the right thing to do, it proved that their chemical products failed. In my opinion, Bacon (who plays Caine) should have come back to being visible at the end of the movie.The ending seems as if the director was either not allowed to make the movie go over a certain time so the finishing had to be very poor, or that there may be a sequel to it.As everyone who's seen it knows that when Bacon died, he was invisible as he fell into the fire. Maybe he could resist that heat?Well anyhow, I would rate this movie 8/10. It has great special effects, a much better story than The Matrix, and it is worth watching in the theaters. Don't wait for this to come out on video, you won't get the same feeling as you would in a cinema, and that, I can guarantee!

I usually like big special effects blockbusters and I've enjoyed several of Paul Verhoeven's films in the past, namely Starship Troopers, Total Recall and Robocop. However, Showgirls is one of my least favorite movies of all time.The movie starts out pretty good, showing off the impressive special effects with an invisible gorilla being brought back. The transformation from invisible to visible or vice versa were astounding. I was very surprised at how real everything looked and was prepped for another fun Verhoeven SFX extravaganza. Unfortunately the movie plummets into a vertical nose dive from there.The premise is simple, scientist doesn't want to lose funding, tests new invention on self, goes horribly wrong. I'm not saying that plot is an important factor in the success of blockbusters but this one really didn't cut it. The change from normal scientist to psychotic killer isn't well defined. They should have put in more scenes of him messing with people on the street, there was one scene but it was confined to a small apartment. I walked into the theater ready to see an invisible man wreaking havoc on dozens of unsuspecting people, but it didn't happen. The whole movie just kind of slides by without a single really interesting thing happening. It just jumps from, him being normal to him being crazy without any real middle ground. I think it would have really spruced up this film to put in a whole period in which the camera follows Sebastian around while he lurks the streets, scaring people left and right. And during this middle period, we see a very frightening sense of power grow and grow in him up until the point that he snaps and goes completly insane. I guess they wanted to make the movie shorter or something because they cover this whole period in one 5 minute scene.So how about the end action and violence? Well, they waste all the really impressive special effects in the beginning of the movie so there wasn't really anything there. The action is fast and bloody but it tends to end before you really get a satisfying look at what's going on. It's very disappointing because as soon as the final showdown between Sebastian and the other scientists begins you already know how it's going to end. It's very easy to guess exactly who's going to live and who's going to die.All in all Hollow Man was a big disappointment. The special effects were very good but it didn't make up for an incredibly thin plot and a lack of explanation. I give Hollow Man 4 stars out of 10.

I ask because the movie seems to use that piece of information along with special effects as its only building blocks.  When I first saw the preview for this movie I thought to myself,  wow that looks awful. It isn't quite as bad as I expected, though it certainly wasn't what I expected. It isn't as bad as I expected because only slowly do you realize how much time they plan to waste on the setup. If you're expecting a movie that is going to explore invisibility and the cool things that could go along with it as I was, let me tell you now this is not that movie at all. The movie spends over an hour before it gets to what we already know and want to see explored, i.e. Bacon's character getting invisible and what he does with that. Instead they use the testing of  invisibility on animals for time filler and attempts at drama. After the animal testing is successful we learn the startling revelation that Bacon's character  is himself going to test it out.  Duh, lets get rolling already. Suddenly Bacon's character, who we have not gotten to know at all, starts behaving like a psycho who wants to off everybody. Elizabeth Shue is just sort of there, as is her love interest in the film, Josh Brolin, who seems to always play a guy that is never quite as bad as we imagine. The pair is so boring, however, that we root against them even as Bacon's scientist character goes berserk. It is a very half-hearted bit of rooting, though, because `Hollow Man' leaves little to root for at all except for it to end . The movie degenerates into a bad sci-fi gore flick stuck in a lab in the movies final half hour. Here we get a kill an invisible guy video game using steam, water, fire and blood as the weapons. Unless you go way back to `The Invisible Man' starring Claude Rains, being invisible is an interesting premise that has never really resulted in a quality film. `Hollow Man' brings the most impressive special effects to date in this latest attempt, but no brains. The movie leaves many questions unanswered such as, was Bacon's character bad to begin with?, or did the testing completely cause his psychotic behavior?  And does it matter? No, it does not.

While he's invisible, we'll have him do what all invisible men want to do. He'll fondle a woman's breast while she's asleep and later we'll have him sexually assault his across-the-courtyard neighbor (who, incidentally, will look like a Victoria's Secret model).

Verhoeven definitely has a style and flair to his pictures but he tends to make them so stupid and emotionally distant that you're left thinking about the strings he tries to pull to get the audience to react rather than getting into (and arguably, enjoying) his movies.First off, the script is undeniably the weakest link.  The story is a collection of cliches from a thousand different sci-fi/horror films before it.  Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Crane, aka Brilliant scientist with pretentious name, a man who is spearheading a militarily funded project (what other kind is there?) to create a human invisibility formula.  Crane is an arrogant jerk with a God-complex from the get go, setting up the psycho-breakdown that eventually comes (one big problem I have with this movie -- and many movies nowadays -- is that the trailer gives away essentially the entire plot, so the audience sits there bored as the movie plods along to the inevitable third act).  I assume this is to remove any doubt that the invisibility formula itself created the evil persona, instead showing that he is overwhelmed by the psychological effects(essentially, the power) that being invisible has on him (that and the love affair his co-worker/ex-girlfriend Elisabeth Shue is having with his co-worker/rival Josh Brolin behind his back, giving him the good old mad jealousy motivation), which is only obvious because any true fan of sci-fi (especially Michael Crichton) know that SCIENCE IS EVIL! and mankind is never ready for technological advances made in movies, let alone ones funded by the military (another certain recipe for catostrophe).  Duh!Of course, the fact that Bacon is such an SOB in the first place lessens any point made about the insidious effects of invisibility.  Basically, his character is unsympathetic from the start, and it's hard to care what happens to the rest because the cast ranges from bland (all the stock supporting characters) to vapid (Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, as the two that will inevitably have to stop Bacon).Verhoeven tries to cover up the script holes by throwing in a lot of interesting invisibility FX and at moments it does, but then you realize the movie is still about nothing and going nowhere.  I actually thought Starship Troopers was half decent as a piece of cornbally trash entertainment that shows the rah-rah hysteria of young soldiers going to war, and who can forget the classic final moment (Doogie Howser probing the big monster and announcing He's afraid! to a roaring crowd).  This movie has no such self-deprecation.  It's just a thrill-less thriller and hokey horror picture.  Maybe worth a rental in order to mock it endlessly with friends, otherwise avoid at all costs.

The truth is, the special effects were amazing and kept my attention through the entire first half of the film...but even that was eventually outdone by the horrible, horrible plot mistakes.  It sounds harsh, I know.  I always hate reviewers who seem to show no mercy whatsoever to a movie attempt.  Trust me, though, my review is isn't even the half of it.

To go to see a super-hyped up slasher version of the invisible man, was a waste of my time and hard-earned cash.  The special effects were OK, but the plot was terrible.  The intro of the movie was cool, but it went downhill from there.  I was wondering why the previews were so mysterious, but now I know why they were that way...Bacon plays a scientist who discovers a formula to make animals and people invisible, but spends 11 months finding a way to bring them back from a phase shift.  One night, the solution magically pops into his head while he is eating the snack of champions, yes, a twinkie...I mean the solution was cheesy also...His ex-girlfriend (Shue) is sleeping with one of their co-workers, which later causes him to go psycho on everyone else in the lab. After about an hour of yap and voyeuristic Bacon drooling at his neighbor, human invisibility is obtained. *YAY*  The people in the lab get pissed at Bacon for going out fulfilling his peeping-tom fantasies.  He kills them off and gets burned for 30 seconds and still survives (imagine that!), gets electrocuted and still survives (another shocker!), and finally falls to a fiery death in an elevator shaft (you mean he couldn't survive a 50 foot fall?).  After a long 2 hours the movie finally ends (and there was much rejoicing!) and I went home.

This is yet one more example of clever CGI and a talented crew being wasted on a lousy script. Gary Scott Thompson (I) and Andrew W. Marlowe are credited for the incredibly poor story and penning.  It is mystifying to me how even Marlowe, whom we can thank for the lackluster End of Days, would be able to screw up the enduring fable of  the Invisible Man.  Thompson's big rebirth into modern Hollywood was achieved by that stellar piece of moviemaking, K-911.  Of course these two story-pitchers, who actually might be capable of intelligent writing for all I  know, may not be the only problems.  The dreaded Hollywood Studio Bonehead Execs, who seem to take over anytime there is a big budget at stake, may have had their own brilliant input, such as `I don't get it!'The classic story of the Invisible Man involves a driven scientist who devises a method to make himself invisible.  He tries out the treatment on himself, but there are two problems 1) Invisibility makes him violently psychotic, and 2) he can't change back.  The story is a rich metaphor for the universal human angst of the permanence of self.  When I first heard about this film, I thought the title Hollow Man promised the exploration of this theme.  I imagined the character of Linda Foster (Shue) torn between her own drive for scientific achievement and her own ethics.  I imagined Sebastian Caine (Bacon) vacillating between his waning human decency and his unleashed primal urges.  I imagined complex characters and timeless themes of the struggle between id and ego, with a tormenting, ambiguous ending. Perhaps Foster would hesitate between her old and current lovers (invisible and visible) at a crucial juncture, resulting in some devastating tragedy. No, what I saw instead was a combined rip-off of basic slasher and satanic flicks, with startling CGI taking the top billing.  The brutal and graphic killings do not energize the movie; they simply tire the audience. The `surprises' are so overused that none of it is surprising, and I am so sick of implausible action scenes that I needed an antiemetic during this flick. Anyone out there ever survived a flash-fire in an elevator shaft?  Oh, well, as long as the flames are only licking your feet you're probably safe, as long as there's no heat produced and the flames apparently produce breathable oxygen.  This kind of super-action works as camp, but not as good science fiction.  The old and boring slasher contrivances range from `Let's spit up!' to `He must be dead so let's turn our backs!'  HELLO!  HOLLYWOOD? ANYBODY IN THERE?  HALLOWEEN IS 22 YEARS OLD!  IT'S NOT GOOD ANYMORE!!!!  I am embarrassed for Paul Verhoeven and his cast.  They are better than this tripe.

Did I not hear the news that the director of the movie suddenly died and someone else was left to complete the project?  This movie took a dramatic downfall into a pile of garbage in which I had trouble believing. Not to ruin the ending for other viewers but how many times did Kevin Bacon's character take a beating and still manage to come back alive.  It was an overkill on the old idea that the bad guy is supposed to come back for one last scare. ****May Ruin Ending for You Below******Let's see.. He was electrocuted... Burned (Oh, the irony in the name Kevin Bacon).. Blown up.. Hit with a crowbar..  Then managed for one more scare until he was finally dead.I didn't know being invisible also made you superhuman.

Being invisible is every man's dream, they only killed this dream in the ending of this movie.

Seeing a human being go from normal to invisible is quite a feat in special effects.  Seeing a man's blood veins, organs, bones, and muscle structure is amazing to see.  It could easily be nominated for a Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.  However, the title hollow not only refers to the visual on the invisible man, but also the texture of the plot.      HOLLOW MAN has a group of scientist testing animals on a formula on turing them invisible.  Getting the animals to become invisible is easy, but bringing them back to normal, by reconstructing their cells is the tricky part.  The team led by a power hungry Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), stays in a lab some hundred feet underground in a hidden government building. His assistant and former love intrest, Linda Foster (Elisabeth Shue) sees Sebastian a genius as well as a psychotic madman. And Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin) competes with Sebastian with wits and strength, as they work together.  But one day, the formula to bring a animal back from being invisible works.  Sebastian, Linda, and Matt take this to the government officials at the pentagon.  They are pleased to hear the success, but Sebastian only tells half the story, so he can try the formula on a human subject, himself.  Sebastian injects himself with the formula and it does turn him invisible.  He walks around the lab, pulling pranks, and doing some rather obscene things with some of the other female lab scientist.  But when trying to bring Sebastian back, it doesn't succeed, and to make things worse, the longer Sebastian is invisible, the more he takes advantage of his invisibility by assulting some women and wanting total control.      I usually enjoy Paul Verhoeven's films.  I thought both ROBOCOP, TOTAL RECALL, and STARSHIP TROOPERS are exciting and fantastic sci-fi/action films.  And yes, I even enjoyed SHOWGIRLS for it's tacky serious attitudes and it's horrible yet funny dialogue.  HOLLOW MAN is a disappointment for Verhoeven, since it seems that all he was concerned about was the quality of the effects.  Yet for everything else, including the acting, characters, and plot, he couldn't care less.      I did highly enjoy the visual effects in this film, and I also liked the music score by long time composer Jerry Goldsmith.  But everything else in the movie ruined it for me. I was laughing at the movie instead of being tense during the final scenes with the scientist battling against the invisible Sebastian.  And I lost count on how many typical Hollywood cliches there were.  From the it's only a dream scene to the false endings.      I was hoping that HOLLOW MAN  was going to be the next step up for the invisible man films.  I did enjoy the original Universal horror film with Claude Raines, and I even enjoyed the recent Chevy Chase/John Carpenter MEMOIRS OF THE INVISIBLE MAN.

Whatever balance Paul Verhoeven found with RoboCop and Starship Troopers, it's gone now-- this movie wasn't funny, it wasn't scary, and it wasn't clever.

Paul Verhoeven is a talented director (not counting Showgirls) but unfortunately this film is firmly entrenched in the miss column. This is frustrating in that he had a pretty excellent movie that simply derails during the last half hour. Kevin Bacon did an admirable job as the cocky, arrogant yet brilliant scientist who slowly over the course of the film becomes affected by his invisibility in ways he couldn't have predicted. My main problem with Hollow Man (and there were several, all within the last 30 minutes) is how utterly absurd the film becomes. Here we have a team of (assumed) incredibly brilliant scientists who huddle like frightened school children when the invisible Bacon becomes deranged and begins killing. Its as if they had no idea it was going to come to this, despite the fact that earlier Bacon sexually assaults a colleague, escapes from the lab, covers it up and lies about it, and kills a lab dog with his bare hands. A normal person, let alone an intelligent scientist, would have pulled the plug long before it got to this point.  The scientists are utterly stupid toward the end of the film. They have many resources available, from infrared glasses to make him visible, to tranquilizers, that they rarely if ever used. They run around blindly bumping into one another while never really using the tools available to them. Further, the protagonist is burned with steam and engulfed in flames from a flamethrower (to the point where EVERY stitch of clothing is burned off), hit in the head with a crowbar and electrocuted, yet still manages to walk about unscathed to cause more harm. I am NOT an idiot, yet the ending of the film treats me as one. Verhoeven, as a filmmaker, should have demanded a rewrite of the script's end. A disappointing movie in that for the first 1.5 hours, this was a solid 8 (possibly a 9), and the last 30 minutes is a 1. Final review 6. I would recommend seeing it if for nothing else the astounding special effects and a rather good performance by Kevin Bacon as a mad scientist.

The first part, where in which (spoilers maybe) a scientist (Kevin Bacon in a fairly credible role) is creating invisible animals and bringing them back to full form. So, he does it on himself and becomes the invisible man. Some might think there is a relation to the 1933 classic. I thought it had more to do with the fly. Still, the visuals are pretty captivating, which shows the invisible man's view of the world without being seen (sometimes). Some parts are very good, but then director Paul Verhoven must've not trusted his audience, because he turned from a fairly intelligent film, to a invisible man version of Predator, where in the third act he is hunted down while he is berserk. While some of this film is good, the destination is a downer; too much is spent on building up to a pay-off that isn't earned with enough wit that should come out of the material. That being said, it might make for some goofy late night viewing some day.

I've held on to that belief, despite the tepid crap that he's made since.SPOILERS COMMENCE NOWHOLLOW MAN trods the same territory as Nicholson Baker's excellent novel, THE FERMATA.  In HOLLOW MAN, Dr. Sebastiane Caine becomes invisible; in THE FERMATA the protagonist (a temp worker) has the ability to stop time. What do these characters do with their unique gifts?  Why, what any man would do they indulge in some sexual misdeeds...But despite sharing essentially the same subject matter, HOLLOW MAN doesn't deserve to be uttered in the same breath as THE FERMATA.HOLLOW MAN is despicable and mean-spirited.  Caine is a hateful, arrogant, vindictive a**hole who, upon discovering the power of being invisible, turns into a rapist and then a murderer.  I could handle this if the scenes of Caine's prowling and molesting were handled by a director who clearly wants to indict Caine's behavior -- but no, Paul Verhoeven is our guide, and the molestations scenes, which proceed to a rape scene, are played for titillation.  It pains me to see men depicted as malicious rapists, but it's far worse to see a film that presents a rape as the ultimate in T&A entertainment.  Indeed, that's precisely how all the young men clustered together in the backs rows during the screening I saw interpreted those scenes; they laughed all the way through them.In THE FERMATA, the protagonist indulges in some disrobing, too.  But he isn't malicious or vindictive or prone to raping and pillaging the second he has the chance.  He's compassionate, and as a result THE FERMATA is *far* more entertaining and insightful than HOLLOW MAN.  The protagonist adores women both physically and spiritually, and seeks to use his power not so much to disrobe and grope, but to serve women's sexuality.  He's playful. He slips sex toys into their handbags for them to discover later.  He dictates erotic stories onto cassette tapes, then slips them into car stereos for the women to suddenly start hearing later.  He types erotic stories (or rot as he calls the milieu) and leaves the pages lying where they will be immediately found, and read.  THE FERMATA covers the same thematic material as HOLLOW MAN, but it ends up as a fun, hilarious and frequently outrageous journey.  It's simply a terrific book.If you're thinking of seeing HOLLOW MAN, do yourself a favor.  Skip it. Just skip it.  It's awful.Instead, go to the bookstore and buy THE FERMATA by Nicholson Baker.  And enjoy a good read.

This film is in the same vein as Jurassic Park and such, in the sense that you sit there with the person you took with you and you both scream out Don't do that!! Stupid! and Look behind you!! WHich is a helluva lot of fun. Of course the film is receiving bad reviews, but I'm used to it. They don't like anything anymore. And what's wrong with a film that is FUN? This takes the invisibility concept and deals with it in a very necessary fashion by questioning what you would do given that sort of immense power The question is, what would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen? We see what Sebastian Cane (Kevin Bacon) would do. At first he slowly turns into a pervert, undressing women and fondling them, then retreats into simple evil as he rapes a woman and begins killing off his colleagues. True, the film doesn't delve into much of the scientific angle of the whole invisibility thing. I don't remember hearing anything about the specifics of exactly HOW they figured out to make people and animals invisible. But people aren't exactly GOING just to hear about that. They're going for the thrill ride - the fun part of it. WHich is people being pursued by a maniac who happens to be invisible. The very thought is frightening. And it's carried off well. There is a line in the script by Andrew W. Marlowe that I wish had ended up in the final film. While they are searching for the mad Cane, Linda (Elisabeth Shue) says to everyone, that if he gets out into the rest of the world invisible, he becomes the most powerful man on earth. That very concept is horrifying, and would have given the audience an extra chill. Oh well. The film is still satisfying. Very exciting, and had my heart rate racing quite a bit. I work at a theatre and had the privilege of seeing it early, Thursday night, the 3rd of August. Everyone in the theatre, my co-workers, enjoyed the film, too. During one particular scene where a muscle- and bone-exposed Sebastian forces Shue to kiss him, one girl in the audience said out-loud Sick, dude! True, there are a lot of graphic scenes in this film, some appalling because you weren't expecting it, but others simply adding to the overall effect of the very circumstances you'd have to see in dealing with this subject matter. Overall a very well-done film, a heart-stopper, and just plain GOOD FUN. (Also, Elisabeth Shue, as always, is a great actress and a pleasure to watch.)

This is a typical offering from a director who has shown himself to be more concerned with the attributes of his female actors than that of the dialogue or plot. There is a reason why most females have never appreciated his work and I believe a growing number of grown men are finding his work to be repetitive and boring. His themes are always sexuality and violence. Violence and sex do sell of course, but it would be nice to see Verhoeven try his hand at something with a little more depth involved.

When Caine figures out a way to bring an invisible gorilla back he is very ready to test this on a human, mainly himself.

The transformation scenes will blow your mind. Bacon is perfectly cast. He just as psychotic as he is cool. He also has some of the best lines in the film. I'm not a big fan of Elisabeth Shue. She looks good but could she pull off the tough scientist (unlike The Saint). She was great. When she got a job to do she gets it done. When she needs to kick some butt she gets it done. She was a fun complement to Bacon's Caine. The other performances were done to the best of their ability but only Bacon and Shue stud out. Now on to what this film was basic made for the eye candy. There is lots of it here. The violence is bloody and there is much nudity. Lots of gruesome  deaths and lots of flesh. This film also does a good job at getting you to jump.

The genre was overdone and out of gas a decade ago (witness the barrage of mediocre Michael Crichton films in the 90s), so why did the Amsterdam-born auteur resort to such mundane storytelling when he managed to make Total Recall and Basic Instinct into such clever classics?The first half of Hollow Man is largely setup and cool CGI.  In the middle of the film we get to see a brief bit of cool Invisible Man voyeurism action.  But the final half-hour is all slasher homicide, explosions, and badguy-comes-back-from-the-dead-for-one-last-scare tripe.

The film is about a scientist who renders himself invisible.It was inspired by H. G. Wells' The Invisible Man. It was directed by Paul Verhoeven.In this sci-fi thriller,scientist Sebastian Caine is working with a secret military research team headed by Dr. Kramer, assigned to create new intelligence technology. With the help of his colleagues Linda McKay and Matt Kensington, Sebastian has been developing a serum that makes people invisible. The formula is new and unstable, but after a risky but successful test on an ape, an impatient Sebastian, under pressure from Kramer, decides to try it on himself. It works, but no one counted on the side effects; unable to reverse the serum's effects, an invisible Sebastian goes insane, and begins pursuing Linda and Matt in a fog of homicidal rage. Hollow Man is commendable in its special effects.It was so great that it got an Academy Award nomination for it.But regardless of it,the story of the film is more of a horror film rather than a science fiction.Aside from that,it became a little bit awkward in the sense that people with that become invisible just turns out to be people imbued with evil qualities and unbelievable sexual urges a.k.a monsters without any scientific explanations attached to it.In summary,the Hollow Man just turned out to be a monster that one should be dreaded from and to be killed in the end which qualifies the movie give the viewer scary entertainment.

So first I'll say all the good things about it. The DVD itself has a very nice transfer to video, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is used very well. Like in an early scene with animal cages all around, it really sounded like we were in the midst of all that commotion. Also, later when a large fly was buzzing around the lab, I could sense it to my right, then behind me, then to my left, then back to the front as it circled. The extras include a fascinating look at how the special effects were done. Which, incidentally, are marvelous to look at.While the effects rate 8 to 10, the story ityself is probably a 2 or a 3.  The small group of scientists, working in an underground lab in DC for the government, are developing a technique to make animals invisible, to eventually be used on people for covert military operations. Kevin Bacon is the leader of the group, and an unconventional person to boot. He decides to try the technique on himself first. Invisible, he only does dastardly things, molesting one of his team while she sleeps, killing a dog in anger, and later entering an apartment and raping a woman. When the restoring serum fails, and he soon figures out he is doomed to a life like that, he gets desperate.Knowing that his team members will report him, he sets out to systematically eliminate each. He succeeds except for his ex-girl (Elizabeth Shue) and her new boyfriend (Josh Brolin) who get the best of him in a fiery elevator shaft. In what turned out to be a funny scene to me, she patched up a big gash in Brolin's side with several big pieces of duct tape. As a dedicated duct tape user, even mending a motorcycle windshield for a 2000-mile trip home, I got a big kick out of that.So, in summary, the science was used only as a way to get the story started, and to provide a situation. Hollow Man in reality is just another thriller where the bad guy is tracking down everyone and he gets his comeuppance in the end.  I must admit we were kept glued to the HDTV for the whole hour and forty-five minutes, but when all is thought over and re-hashed, it is not a very good move at all.

There are so many directions the filmmakers could have gone with this one. Unfortunately they chose to go in a dark, dreary, depressing and not particularly enjoyable direction. Basically they turned it into just another slasher film. This movie certainly didn't have to be played entirely for laughs but if you insist on turning your lead character into such a villain at least a few lighter moments sprinkled throughout surely would have helped. As it is what we're left with is a movie with dazzling special effects and pretty much nothing else at all to recommend it.Hollow Man tells the story of brilliant scientist Sebastian Caine who, along with his small group of colleagues, is working on a top secret invisibility formula. They've been testing the procedure on animals. A scene showing an invisible gorilla being made to reappear from the inside out is the best thing the movie has to offer. It looks simply stunning. Unfortunately it's all downhill from there. Sebastian decides he'll be the first human test subject. He is made to disappear (in another visually impressive scene) but when it's time to make him reappear things go awry and he is left invisible. This apparently causes Sebastian to lose his mind and he spends the rest of the movie trying to kill everyone he knows. Yawn.Even if he decided to make his invisible man a ruthless villain director Paul Verhoeven surely could have had some fun with it. But no, his idea of fun is having the invisible man rape his neighbor. Perhaps being invisible will open the door for some ingenious criminal activity for this supposedly brilliant man? Nope, just have him go around mindlessly killing people. Playing the role of Sebastian, Kevin Bacon does the best he can to bring this invisible killer to life but he's let down by the material. And the rest of the cast is reduced to spending the whole movie spouting silly dialogue and running around all terrorized by the invisible lunatic in laughable, nonsensical and interminable action sequences. Yes, in typical slasher movie fashion this villain just won't die. And so the movie goes on and on and on...and never gets any better. In fact it seems to get worse as it goes. Give this movie a little credit for the impressive visuals but it gets no credit for anything else. Rarely have the appearance of the closing credits bought such blessed relief.

It's nice to see a modern movie that remains unceasingly interesting throughout, mixing horror with science and actually having a storyline as opposed to an excuse for bloodshed.One of the things that I loved about this film was the special effects involved. They will truly creep you out and blow your mind simultaneously, especially the transformation scenes. This movie had the potential to be a complete disaster, another failed rework of a comic-book world. Instead, it is a fascinating tale of power, corruption and rage, with no unlikely explanations and a world so close to reality that afterwards you will find yourself looking around nervously every time you get changed, wondering if you are alone.The only thing that might turn some viewers away is the gore involved. Some of the things that happen in it are quite shocking and can make you do anything from wincing to vomiting.What I especially liked about it was that the characters are actually smart. Unlike most teen slasher movies, where the victims invariably run about screaming and waving their hands above their heads until they die, the people in this film know how to survive. It is just as well, because they are all scientists and you would expect them to do more than run away in an attempt to save their lives.

The planet I live on, Earth, is populated by a species known as homo sapiens, and a quite substantial portion of the male population of said species WOULD commit sexual offenses if they were INVISIBLE and thought they CAN'T GET CAUGHT. Especially an egomaniac like the main character. On the DVD commentary track, Verhoeven, Bacon, and the screenwriter discuss the character. It's all there, he's an exhibitionist (flashy cars, half posing in front of the women before the first injection), he's a man for whom control is a very crucial issue, and he's a man for whom sex, like everything else, is a matter of control and superiority. And are you forgetting that other than survival, sex is the most powerful instinct in a male? Are rapes an uncommon thing? Do you think people don't do it more because of high moral standards or a fear of getting caught? This movie is about a man who turns invisible, and what the enormous power over others that he's given does to change him. Verhoeven mentioned that thousands of years ago, Plato wrote in one of his dialogues (The Rebublic, for those who want to look it up) about the nature of humans, and how fear of getting caught might be the reason why some men appear 'just'. As an example, Plato gave a man who could turn invisible. This movie asks the same question, and shows what happens to a character who is initially likeable, but is human and has evil in him. Just like that nice high school kid who was so nice to old people, right before the drunken date rape. I'm not saying Hollow Man is a deeply philosophical movie, or worthy of drawing any deep parallels between it and Plato's writings; what I am saying is that if you are shocked by this movie, then you are a prude, and a complete idiot who probably called Fight Club too violent and thought A Clockwork Orange was horrible crap that promoted rape. DEPICTION IS NOT PROMOTION.As for the movie... starts wonderfully, stays interesting until the end, where it just turns into a mindless action/thriller movie. Mindless, but entertaining still.

'Hollow Man' is not a good movie, no matter how you slice it, but it does seem to be a deliberate imitation of cheesy sci-fi/horror films of another era. Granted, it's more like Roger Corman's films than James Whale's; in fact, it seems to have been most inspired by Corman's underrated 'X--The Man with the X-Ray Eyes' (minus the existentialism), and we almost wish Verhoeven had attempted a straight remake of that instead. As it is, the drive-in sensibilities here are sticky, but not entirely unpalatable. Kevin Bacon chews the scenery admirably, but he's probably too likable an actor ever to be entirely convincing in bad-guy roles. Elisabeth Shue continues her sad decline; she's not bad in this, but it's impossible to watch her in any of her recent films without thinking of her brilliant turn in 'Leaving Las Vegas' and howling in frustration that this talented actress is wasted in stuff like this. Josh Brolin is well tuned in to his earnest good-guy scientist part; it's the kind of role that might have been played by John Agar or Leslie Nielsen or Russell Johnson in the 50s and 60s B-pictures, and he does it pretty well. The colors are lurid, and the CGI effects are appreciably over-the-top. The dialogue is often laughable, and the plot twists only get stupider as we go along. So there's really very little to recommend at all here, but I give it a 2 out of 10, which means I recommend it for those who love bad movies, and for them only. "},{"Title":"Bad?

Usually good movies are sunk by the critics and loved by general public, but Hollow Man is different, general public, found it bad or `not SO interesting', and critics found it either good or interesting. If so, now I consider myself a critic. I loved Hollow Man. Although everyone knows the story of the invisible man, it hasn't been done lately, since the 1930's really, and this 2000 remake was great, it has everything nowadays public enjoy in a movie well known actors, interesting twists, awesome special effects, good action sequences and decent jump scenes, and this one is over-the-top in each of these categories! Also what makes Hollow Man so sweet is the fact of uniting, a great cast, Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue..., a great composer Jerry Goldsmith, and a one time good director Paul Verhoven. Even being totally different as you are seeing this, you keep associating it with Basic Instinct, atmosphere, actors everything but Hollow Man is a jump forward! It really is. Paul Verhoven does his thing again, action, SFX, beautiful women nudity. Saying yes to a project in which you are out of `sight' during almost all of the movie is a big challenge, halfway through the movie Kevin Bacon turns invisible and so he stays until the end, I mean, he is there, only painted on blue, or green, to be replaced by the special effects, which are great (for any reason they were nominated to the Oscar, and unfairly lost it to Gladiator. &#150; I don't know why) Bottom line, Hollow Man was kind of a breath of fresh air in Hollywood last year, this film can't be praised enough, I can't praise it enough, congratulations to everyone involved. 10 out of 10  "},{"Title":"The Invisible Man Meets the American Psycho","Date":"2 September 2001","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Whose voyeuristic fantasies was this film helping to express?

This film was awful.  Now, let me praise some aspects before I get too carried away condemning it.  The special effects are top-notch.  The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film are eye-grabbing scenes as we see the transformation from invisibility to visibility before our very eyes.  The sets and budget are well-used as far as creating a great scientific lab.  But then the script starts to take over and we get a perverted scientist who supposedly is a genius of such great magnitude care about nothing more than copping a field and and playing peek-a-boo with his sexy neighbor.  I really thought this was such a sophomoric approach to a subject that could have been handled with such greater depth. Kevin Bacon is okay working with this material.  The rest of the cast is okay too.  Elisabeth Shue looks real nice in some low-cut panties and Kim Dickens has a fine pair of breasts, but these do not good acting make.  Nor do they make a good film. I guess what upsets me most is that Hollow Man gave the impression with its huge budget, state of the art technology, use of director Paul Verhoeven, and its endless ad campaign that it was an A picture.  In reality, it is nothing more than an 80's or 90's B picture trapped in an A picture's budget.  And what makes it even worse is that the ending of te film is one of the most ridiculously staged endings I have ever seen in film.  The guy is invisible not superman!  I really like Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, but I must admit that he really did a poor job with this film and must take most of the blame.

In film that vision has to be cinematic above all -in general successful filmmakers develop a single strategy to deliver a well crafted film, and some intelligent directors try to master several strategies.All too often, the strategy is to rely on the simplest of cinematic principles, the visual. So we get explosions with lots of plasma, plus whatever the latest technology can deliver. In `The Perfect Storm' it was CG water; here it is the advance toward CG humans (in two scenes at the beginning and the climax at the end). It is possible to use these as tools to create a tone that resonates, but all to often that resonance never appears. `Star Wars' creates a unique tone, and is a success despite bad acting and a hokey story. `Hollow Man' doesn't, so is instead hobbled by its actors and writer. Verhoven has had too many tries at this and too many failures. Only `Basic Instinct' instinct keeps him alive in Hollywood - the tone there was built around simple misogynism, and thankfully there's only so far one can go with that.`Hollow Man' is a particularly troubling as the H G Wells story itself successfully constructs a tone that is pretty disturbing and memorable. Effects and a competent vision could have built on that to produce one of the best films of all time. Bacon isn't great as actors go, but he is one of the best when it comes to understanding this notion of collaborative tone and contributing to its ruthless progress.No more Verhoven for me.

Josh Brolin plays her new beau whom Cain wants to kick in the ass because they both desire Shue. Kim Dickens also appears and dies graphically. Rhona Mitra has the misfortune of playing Caine's neighbour whom he spies on and then eventually rapes. Without addressing the invisibility theme it becomes a big hollow graphic mess.

HOLLOW MAN is nothing more than a B-movie, but look how expensive it is! It must have cost a fortune to create believable special effects illusions as an invisible man. These special effects are exquisitely impressive, they're an eye-fest! But, in terms of plot, script and characters, HOLLOW MAN is as modified as an old drive-in B-movie from Roger Corman. Besides having a barren script, the film is also too unpleasant and bloody. Although it is quite natural for a movie like this to be intense (as in any film boldly directed by Paul Verhoeven), the violence here is too intense, it's hardly a form of entertainment.Kevin Bacon is fine in the role of Sebastian Cane, a scientist who volunteers to be injected with a serum that allows one to be invisible to the human eye. The serum is discovered by a bunch of scientist led by a headstrong female scientist named Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue). Josh Brolin and Kim Dickens are among the other scientists. Their experiment is a success, but with every success as great as this, there's bound to be a drawback. Jeez, don't they ever learn? Anyway, Sebastian turns himself to a psychopath who uses his invisibility to do all manner of mayhem that gets lethal as it goes on.In short, HOLLOW MAN is just another creature-feature with a big cast. Comparing this to ANACONDA, another low-light in the creature feature genre, it makes that one look like a work of a great artist. Both are mediocre and unimpressive, as both are extremely weak on the writing department, but at least ANACONDA had more suspense. HOLLOW MAN, even with blood gushing at every opportunity, not a moment is done with genuine tension. The film is scary for a younger audience, and even to some young teenagers, but anyone who has seen a lot of other movies of this kind will feel that the presence of the creature is more than a whimper.No character in this film is engaging or interesting (perhaps what's interesting is that how could these stars accept such half-baked character roles).

Villains and heroes alike. I had no bias, I just wanted them all dead.

EVERY ONE OF THEM.It's amazing what you can do when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror anymore.How true this quote from the movie is.  Kevin Bacon, the ugliest man in Hollywood, has found a role he was born to play.  A role in which we no longer have to look at that mug of his.  I mean, who are we kidding, folks? This is one ugly dude.Bacon plays Sebastian Cane, a (mad) scientist who develops a formula for invisibility.  Sebastian is not a likable guy.  To put it plain, he is an a**hole.  He is a sex fiend (okay, my fault-- nothing wrong there.)  But he also treats people like sh*t and even jokes around about calling himself God.  Elisabeth Shue (ya know, that 30 year old high school chick from Adventures In Babysitting) plays Linda McKay, fellow colleague and Sebastian's ex lover.  Josh Brolin plays Matthew, fellow colleague as well as the guy who's currently bangin' Linda, but this fact is being kept secret from Sebastian.The Pentagon has instilled their trust (and millions) in 5 workers with a dream.  Right there, is where the movie lost me, and we learn this about 10 minutes in.  Sebastian injects his formula into lab animals, then tests it on himself and becomes invisible.  After 3 days of testing, the serum malfunctions, for reasons not explained in the movie, and Sebastian remains invisible.Actually, not much happens in this movie.  You would think the possibilities would be endless, but Paul Verhoeven (who also directed RoboCop and Total Recall) leaves us hanging.  The tagline for the film is What would YOU do if you were invisible?  I thought about this.  After becoming invisible, after about 5 minutes of adjustments from initial shock, I'm sure I would, of course, grab a few booties.  But rape?  Murder?  I think not.  You see, the film asks us if our human nature is more far fetched than we dare to dream.  The reason why this question doesn't work is because Sebastian is an a**hole already.  We don't like him visible OR invisible.  He is NOT like most people, therefore, we can throw the human nature element out the window.  We do not sympathize with him.Instead of exploring the many ways being invisible can help or hurt a man, this movie keeps him in a lab for the most part.  And when Sebastian DOES get out into the real world, what does he do?  Murders a man.  Rapes a woman.  Is this all the writers could think of?  Actually, we only assume the woman was raped.  They leave this as a mystery, probably to leave a door open for a sequel (Hollow Boy, anyone?)  This movie is full of bad acting and worse dialogue.  When Sebastian finds out that Linda is screwing Matthew, he goes into a fit of rage and actually mutters the line I'll show them!!!  Like he's friggin' Lex Luthor or something.This is the kind of movie where a man gets bitten in his hand by a gorilla and is fine in the next scene.  The kind of film where fire does not hurt the villain, where bullets, cuts and gashes don't hurt the hero, and yes...the kind of movie that still has the balls to kill the black character first.  I love it.  Most critics and most people I have talked with all agree this movie is downright stupid, but for some reason, everyone is trippin' off the superior special effects.  But it's the 21st century. Aren't the special effects SUPPOSED to be great by now?  I mean, it's what I have come to expect in movies now.  Wake up, people!!  We are in the future, I don't expect to see objects floating around on a string!So I'll be fair.  I'll give this movie 2 stars out of 5.  One star for the special effects (yawn) and one more star because we saw very little of Kevin Bacon, and that face of sin that only a mother could love.* * out of 5.

Unfortunately, for him, the nineties were spent in the wilderness because he seems to have lost his talent and his fame. This sad statement of fact is confirmed by  Showgirls (1995), Starship Troopers (1997) and especially Hollow Man (2000).Concerning, this last movie, well what I can say about this is that it isn't an appalling movie special effects are outstanding. Besides, special effects have always been Verhoeven's specialty. As usual, in his movies, action and bloody always get on well.But Hollow Man is spoiled by a bad screenplay. It's probably one of the worst scripts ever written for a science-fiction movie. It's got all the possible faults -conventional Elizabeth Shue and her lover are the only ones to manage from Kevin Bacon's trap.-unlikely Elizabeth Shue's lover is badly injured like his workmates but he'll survive from his injuries whereas the other won't!-labored the movie borrows sequences from other movies. When Bacon's walking down the street in the night, several sequences give an impression of déjà-vu (when he's in the young woman's flat). Moreover,the action sequences don't create any surprises because the end is too predictable.-unfinished Verhoeven doesn't explain us enough why Bacon refuses to become himself again. Does he wish to charm Shue? Is he looking for conceit and power because he's invisible?You could even describe hollow man as a pointless movie. Indeed, the manager asks the scientists to prove the effectiveness of their invention on a human being but the proof with the gorilla, doesn't it speak of itself?A disappointing movie that makes indifferent and it's a pity because the topic was very interesting.

I gather a lot of work went into this particular special effect. God knows why it's revolting to look at it, and why Verhoeven would include such images unless he absolutely had to is beyond me. But note this when the antihero BECOMES invisible, he becomes invisible from the outside in the precise opposite of what you'd expect from the example of the gorilla. We get yet ANOTHER hideous, and hideously expensive, CGI animator's dream of a  transformation scene when a simply optical fade, of a kind that was technologically feasible a hundred years ago, would have made better story sense in addition to being easier on the eye. And note the title HOLLOW Man. Surely the metaphor would have been better served if the first time Kevin Bacon vanished from sight, he indeed appeared to be hollow. (In a way he does, but only because all that computer-generated offal is none too convincing.)(2) I'd heard that Verhoeven was inspired by the story Plato tells in The Republic of a ring that makes you invisible, and the corrupting effect such a ring would have on its owner, who could enjoy all the public benefits of being a virtuous man while living the secret life of a scoundrel. It's hard not to notice how much better the premise is in Plato's version. Kevin Bacon's character is found out within hours. His secret life as a scoundrel is very soon no secret at all; in fact, it had hardly been a secret even before he turned invisible. And note that Kevin Bacon cannot turn visible again, and so CAN'T lead a public life as a virtuous man. This is the tragedy of the antihero in H.G. Wells's story, whose invisible man at first thinks he has a gift but finds himself CUT OFF from society. Either story works well Verhoeven's mistake is to try to tell both at once.

It's the same tired old routine about a man who makes himself invisible then goes crazy. The transformation of Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) to invisibility is definitely the film's highlight.After his dumb colleagues fail to return him to normal however, Caine decides to get rid of them. They act surprised for reasons unknown to me. ALL of the animals they made invisible exhibited behavioral problems afterwards. Yet, they never once asked themselves WHY? Caine admitted that bright lights bothered him but do they use this as a weapon against him? Of course not! They are fighting an invisible madman so what do they do-SPLIT UP-to make it easier to be victimized. Consequently, when they go down faster than teenagers in a slasher film, I feel it's no great loss.The final straw occurred near the end when Caine is clobbered with a crowbar, electrocuted, and received burns that would easily have the average man pushing up daisies. Yet, he foolishly kept coming back for more. Apparently, the formula had the unforeseen side effect of strengthening Caine's body while weakening his brain.

The visual effects were the only thing that lived up to my expectations and they kind of saves this movie. The dialog of this movie is filled with stupid lines and the acting is bad. The heroes, inbetweeners and foes of this movie are stereotypical and fail to offer anything new, except that all of the characters are rather horny and a bit too good looking to be considered as scientists. Even in this movie the Hollywood computers function with the user banging the keyboard, which is both annoying and hilarious.All in all a bad movie with nice visuals. Rent it, but do not buy. Could be better if not taken seriously.

Aren't there more interesting things a guy who's invisible could do?  I would hope so.The movie is so obvious.  It's clear what's going to happen, who will die, and how, from the start of the slasher elements.  There's little suspense, and you'll find yourself just yelling at the idiocy of the movie.  For example, in one scene Bacon's invisible man is covered in blood.  In the next, he's completely clean and invisible again.  In another movie the creators might have stopped to wonder just how exactly he showered his entire body (To remove blood, not an easy thing) so that he was invisible again.  But, nah, they just assumed the audience would be stupid enough not to notice.  And the final scene with the rising fire and the elevator...let's not even go into it.I cannot believe that $95 million was wasted on that film.  The effects were incredible, and almost worth seeing, if you don't have to pay.  It seems ridiculous to spend that much money on so very little.  Couldn't they have afforded at least a half of a script on that much money?The saddest part was on the night I watched this, I hated it to the point of screaming at the television, but it still wasn't the worst thing I saw that night (That honor belonged to the insanely bad Ladies Man).Avoid.

We then watch (to the extent you can watch someone who is invisible) as he descends farther and farther into insanity.The interesting question that follows us throughout the movie (voiced by one of Caine's co-workers in the experiment) is simple and even profound what would you do if you could do it without any possibility of being caught? If there were absolutely no responsibility for your actions? Reflecting on these questions is a rather humbling experience! How far would any of us go? It's an interesting question about human nature.The supporting performances of Elisabeth Shue as Linda McKay, Caine's former love interest and Josh Brolin as Matthew Kensington, Linda's current love interest (both fellow scientists in the experiment) are all right although not overwhelming. I felt the strongest supporting performance was that of Kim Dickens as the morally troubled veterinarian Sarah Kennedy.The special effects were also very good.This movie is deserving of an 8/10.

Or, stated in more universal terms, are we humans really innately good and moral beings, concerned with the well being of the fellow members of our species?  Or are we merely held back from acting out our base primal urges for evil and destruction through fear of detection and punishment?  This intriguing premise serves as the basis for `Hollow Man,' a sci-fi thriller that, initially at least, toys with some of these deeper themes yet, like so many big budget action films, ultimately yields to incredibility, preposterousness, and over-the-top sensationalism.A movie like `Hollow Man' provides a rather unique opportunity for a lead actor - in this case, Kevin Bacon - in that he probably only appears on screen for about a third of the duration of the film.  It is probably the skimpiest lead role in movie history, since most of the rest of the time he merely needs to contribute voice over assistance or appear behind a hollowed out rubber mask.Credit the filmmakers with at least having the courage to present a rather despicable character as their protagonist.  Yet, even in its initial stages, when it appears as if it might actually explore the more metaphorical aspects of the title and examine the hollowness within the central figure himself, the film still suffers from both credibility gaps and lapses in logic.  We are supposed to believe, for instance, that the Pentagon would be willing to fund this ragtag collection of babes and hunks masquerading as serious scientists in their research into invisibility - though the purpose for the Pentagon's interest in the experiment is never adequately explained to us.   None of the researchers seem as if they will be pushing middle age anytime soon and Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine, is particularly unconvincing as the `genius' he is purported to be since he never utters a single observation whose profundity would challenge the average junior high school student teetering on the verge of puberty.  In fact, Caine, when he isn't trumpeting his own accomplishments to a rather unappreciative world, can be found peering lustfully through the blinds at the very sexy neighbor across the alley.  This tendency towards voyeurism sets the character up for some profound possibilities once he himself turns invisible, yet after a few halfhearted thrusts in that direction, the filmmakers end up locking all the characters into the laboratory while a by-now-crazed Caine attempts to knock them all off one by one.  This is where the movie really falls apart.  The filmmakers - writers Gary Scott Thompson and Andrew W. Marlowe along with the normally gifted director Paul Verhoeven - lose all control of the potentially intriguing themes they have hitherto set up and spend the last hour or so piling on one action movie cliché and character inanity after another.  Why make a movie about an invisible man if you don't intend to do anything interesting with it?  By the end, `Hollow Man' begins to feel like just the latest variant on the `Alien' movies, `Deep Blue Sea,' `The Thing' and countless other films wherein a group of people are trapped and being hunted by a force with superior powers.Another flaw  how is Caine, in his invisible state, able to move around so soundlessly?  People do make noise when they move and it seems unlikely that Caine's presence would really be all that hard to detect.Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens and others in the cast aren't given much of an opportunity to exercise their acting muscles - and, unlike Bacon, they are not afforded the option of blanking themselves into invisibility for the duration.  Considering the results on screen, Bacon just might be a genius after all!A special note  while I was viewing this film at home, someone knocked on my front door - and, guess what, there was no one there!

It's here that the movie also loses its sense of direction, becoming a tired old monster on the loose in the lab thriller. However, Hollow Man not only employs age-old plot devices, but also some of the worst dialogue heard on the big screen this year.The special effects are suitably impressive while Jerry Goldsmith's grandiose score lends the movie a class it doesn't really deserve.There's a finale in a lift shaft which will have you groaning into your popcorn while the fact that the villain comes back from the dead more times than Freddie Krueger will try your patience to the limits.The tide has turned in Hollywood with films like Lake Placid being far stronger for avoiding the obvious finale with three endings scenario.It's a pity someone didn't tell Verhoeven whose English language movies have always been glorious satirical adventures - Showgirls being the weakest link in the chain.This is a good Friday night popcorn thriller which works well as long as you leave your expectations at the door.Bacon is as good as ever while Shue lends beauty and brains to the proceedings. Look out too for Rhona Mitra as the absurdly gorgeous and rather stupid exhibitionist who insists on getting undressed with her curtains open, another yawnsome cliche which should have been stamped out years ago.Most blokes will be slack of jaw by the former Pepsi Chart host who seems to be making it big in Hollywood with the sort of figure that will leave most girls cursing her name.

I just felt I had to add one or two pointsSPOILER ALERT some of the cliches mentioned below will give a bit away. But believe me, you'll see it coming anyway.1. The cliches I hardly know where to begin. This movie is just a morass of cliches thinly glued together by a cliched plot. You've got your arrogant scientist turns mad through overwhelming pride. You've got your bad guy who kills anyone with one blow, but himself repeatedly gets up after apparently fatal injury. You've got your chance to finish him off missed when he is assumed to be dead. Then there's your bomb discovered with seconds on the clock, the innocent who is told to stay put (but wanders off alone, into danger), the anxious scene with defibrillation paddles when someone undergoes a medical procedure, the elevator shaft climbing scene, and the anxious dash to escape as the bad guy's lair is destroyed. All in all, there hardly seems to be a single original scene in the movie - oh, except maybe the toilet scene, which is nothing to be proud of.2. Plot holes, nonsequiters, technical errors, and just plain nonsense. I'm not talking about the whole invisibility thing, all the attendant problems (like blindness), and so on. I'll allow suspension of disbelief for that. I'm talking about stuff like no matter how the guy is marked, he's always invisible again in the next scene. Stuff like, letting rip with a flamethrower doesn't set off the sprinklers unless you aim right at them (not to mention several other fires...). Caine (Bacon) repeatedly comes and goes at a high security facility without any guards noticing his face is different. The victims have goggles that enable them to see Caine, so they leave them off as much as possible, and later forgo them entirely. Less than 200g of nitroglycerine annihilates a massive, reinforced concrete subterranean complex, in a fireball that roils for tens of minutes but doesn't emit any heat upwards. Restraints designed to restrain a panicked gorilla are repeatedly pulled apart by a man. High pressure steam pies are shattered by an air pistol dart. Walk-in freezers have no internal door handle (that would be too safe!) etc, etc etc3. The sexual assaults that no-one notices are one thing, but the toilet scene is really quite gratuitous. And it doesn't make sense, either with a bizarre bathroom straight out of a marine bootcamp, there is nowhere for him to hide when she puts the goggles on. (She's looking at the door and cupboards the whole time).All in all, this is a highly dumbed down movie.

The morals of this movie are questionable at best - I am not a prude and hardly ever complain about bad messages being sent by movies - but nary a comment about experimenting on animals, and nary a comment about molesting unsuspecting women while you are invisible.

The Hollow Man is a Sci-Fi Thriller, What else did you want them to do with the movie, did you want Kevin Bacon to turn into a pig and go to the market? Would you rate it higher then, the producer did everything he could to keep the movie as realistic as he could and he did. People, you went to see an invisible movie, that means everything is up for grabs, for instance, look at The Sixth Sense, most of you people love that story.. Tell me what was so good about that? I found nothing, i wasn't Thrilled about anything in that movie and if you check out the front cover of the movie it's suppose to be the #1 thriller of 99, hahah Rubbish... Other than the upstairs scene in the movie that was the only thing that got my sub par attention. And the ending of that movie was so realistic my roommate and I had guessed that half way through the movie. I was far more intrigued with the hollow man, i was actually scared three times in this movie that got me out of my chair, the last time I can remember that happened is when Freddy Kruger came out of the closet in one of the past episodes. The problem with viewers these days is they expect to much of a film, I have taken courses at college on Film Genre, and Media arts, so i know how people react to certain things. The only thing i can see what happened with this movie is people expected way too much from it, all the critics bashed it from the get go and then all the people followed suit...And for people to say the ending is predictible go watch any horror movie and you pretty much can predict It. I can see no way in the blue moon that Space Cowboys could get a higher rating than The Hollow Man, except for Star Power. And as far as my views i wouldnt go see 3 old timers anymore, I want the hottest stars in the world. and hottest isnt Eastwood, Sutherland, and Cromwell, the last time Eastwood made a good movie was like Dirty Harry, True Crime is the worst of all time and Deep Blue Sea With Sutherland was a complete joke. Bacon (Stir of Echoes) and Shue (Leaving Las Vegas) are two stars worthy of this role. But as usual like my friend Jenna told me if Brad Pitt would have played the role of Sebastian she would have went right away, just to see Certain Scenes that happened later in the movie. Sex and Invisibility sells as it shows that the hollow man reached number 1 at the box office and Space Cowboys had enough trouble selling tickets to go see it.. But this is always how it will be now of days, when was the last time that people wanted to see a true horror/sci fi movie? Ever since Freddy and Jason left the scene movies have gotten worse and worse.. we have Spice Girl movies now for the love of god ;) I can almost predict that 1/4 of the people who voted the movie lower and who have a dvd player, will buy the DVD when it comes out since they will show more about the special effects and delete scenes from the movie, possibly an Alternate Ending.... Any way you look at it The Hollow Man Hit # 1 on the Box Office so it proves that people wanted to see this movie, this movie will continue it's reign and dethrown the Sixth Sense as best movie that has come out of August in Along time!

The CGI was good, unfortunately the movie also contains the usual Hollywood cliché of overly large, too-big explosions. Sorry, but I'm not impressed with the size of explosions in a movie. Give me a good story line.Another problem with this movie is that with the exceptions of a few scenes, the entire story takes place deep underground at a secret government lab. I guess they spent so much on CGI that they didn't have enough left over to build many different sets. But the movie would have been better had the main character, while invisible, investigate what it was like to be invisible in a large city. But of this we only got a couple scenes.What could have been an interesting view into what it would really be like to be invisible turns into a B slasher movie plot. And that, I think, is the real shortcoming of this movie. They relied too much on special effects and forgot about the story.Two stars, one for the good special effects (not the huge explosions).

Starring Elizabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin, and William Devane, this violent, trashy, unacknowledged retread of director James Whale's 1933 classic The Invisible Man offers out-of-sight special effects, buckets of blood & gore, but lacks heart, soul, and substance. This transparent $85 million trip borrows elements from the Predator movies, all those I-Am-God science fiction sagas where a mad scientist acts as his own guinea pig, and virtually every brainless slasher flick. Starship Troopers director Paul Verhoeven and End of Days scenarist Andrew W. Marlowe pose a provocative philosophical question what would you do if you were invisible? Sadly, the answer isn't as provocative.As Sebastian Coe, Kevin (Death Sentence) Bacon plays a scientific genius whose ego undermines him from the outset. Under the supervision of Dr. Howard Kramer (William Devane of Space Cowboys), Cole and fellow scientists Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue of Leaving Las Vegas), his ex-girlfriend that he left, research assistant and rival lover Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin of American Gangster), and veterinarian Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens of Mercury Rising), are testing a serum that can render a man invisible. Initially, their potion succeeds one a primate. They erase a gorilla then restore it, but the ape suffers some dire side effects.Afraid the Pentagon may evict him after they obtain his miraculous results, Cole lies about his progress. Later, outside the Pentagon, McKay and Matt demand an explanation. Sebastian explains he wants to test the chemical on himself, without Dr. Kramer's approval. Inexplicably, Linda and Matt condone his unethical conduct, while Sebastian misleads the other technicians. All goes well as Cole vanishes before their eyes. He had planned to remain invisible for three days, but the serum fails to restore him, and he is trapped in a body that he cannot see and suffers from a kind of cabin fever because Linda and Matt refuse to let him go outside.Frantically, our heroes scramble for a cure. Ten days elapse without a solution. Sebastian turns psychotic and embarks on a gratuitous killing spree. Cutting his colleagues off from the outside world, he traps them in the lab and eliminates them one by one. Imaginatively, they douse him with water, spray him with foam, and soak the floor with blood to expose him. Linda toasts him with a flame thrower, but nothing can halt Sebastian. Anybody that cannot tolerate exaggerated violence with buckets of blood and gore should think twice about watching Hollow Man. Not even the marginal camp factor can compensate. When one of our heroes is gutted with a crowbar, the heroine stops the bleeding From Dusk Till Dawn style by duck taping shut the hero's wound.The first act of Hollow Man assails us with eye-popping special effects, particularly the way that the test subjects vanish, reminiscent of those 3-D acetate transparencies in encyclopedias. Hollow Man demonstrates the true meaning of anti-climax in an actioneer. Deplorably, acts two and three degenerate into a mindless slasher flick with the cast behaving like cretinous victims. The first act pays off, but the last two blow it miserably. Like Halloween, the seemingly indestructible Hollow Man villain doesn't just throw in the towel after he's badly burned and clobbered with a crowbar, he comes back for more and more! Hollow Man emerges as much a sci-fi thriller as it is a soaper with its sexually aroused characters. Kevin Bacon revels in his villainy as much as he did in Sleepers and The River Wild, while Elizabeth Shue matches wits with him in a somewhat suspenseful game of cat and mouse. The message here is that you cannot thwart a determined woman if you are invisible.Dutch director Paul Verhoeven maintains headlong momentum throughout these horrendous histrionics, but he cannot salvage Marlowe's predictable, see-through script. Hollow Man emerges as an even worse movie than Showgirls. The final set-piece in the lab resembles Alien in that our heroes track the invisible man with a thermal imaging system, but it does them little good. Incredibly, when they should be wearing their thermal imaging glasses, they are not! A major flaw in Marlowe's script is that an adequate explanation is never given for what turns Caine into a psycho. Not even the scantily-clad cast can distract us from the glitches in this far-fetched fantasy. Verhoeven doesn't ante up as much nudity as he did in Showgirls, but he tries to show off as much of the human body and privates as he can. Caine's strip-teasing apartment neighbor exemplifies an extraneous plot element. She turns on audiences when she undresses in front of open blinds as much as she titillates the horny Caine. Moviegoers that abhor simulated cruelty to animals should beware. Caine brutally kills an invisible dog in one scene because he is going crazy listening to the animal bark.Ultimately, Hollow Man comes up empty-handed.

Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team are developing a type of serum that can transform matter that's invisible to matter that's visible. There's no explanation as to why they're doing this and what the purpose is behind their research. As I mentioned, the narrative is set up in quite a bizarre and fairly inaccessible way, but this is really the least of the problems with this film.This is another film that seems to start with an intelligent and original concept, but gradually wastes this intriguing idea by creating a screenplay that is totally moronic and a whole host of characters that are utterly contemptible.Sebastian was obnoxious and slightly arrogant at the start of the film, but never in an overbearing or particularly nasty way. The most obvious example of this is when he refers to himself as 'God'. This made his nastier persona in the second half very difficult to accept - he basically becomes a certifiable nutter with no real explanation for his psychotic behaviour - yes he's jealous of his ex's partner and yes it's possible that the serum could have played a part in his erratic behaviour, but it's inconclusive making his behaviour hard to tolerate.I expected Sebastian to create mischief whilst he's invisible and at the start he does just play fairly harmless mischievous pranks (such as undoing a woman's top and so). Again however out of the blue, he uses his invisibility for much darker purposes such as Forcing himself on an innocent woman (the only good thing about that scene was seeing Rhona Mitra's fantastic body - wow she's hot). Then later in the film we see Sebastian pick a dog up by its tail and smash its head against the cage door ultimately killing the dog. The scene where Sebastian forces himself on his neighbour is a little more understandable as you get the impression that he's a bit of a 'horndog' who has little respect for women, but his cruel behaviour was still a little too much to take. However, I could find no reason behind him killing the dog other than to shock the audience.What starts out as an intelligent script gets worse and worse as it progresses; we see Sebastian continually escaping with not one member of the team having the foresight to restrain him or tranquilise him.There are a few occasions when there is one team member watching Sebastian and on both occasions the team members fall asleep allowing Sebastian to escape. Why not have 2 people there at all times with one person watching him while the other person sleeps? Utterly stupid.The writers try to crank up the tension in the closing stages, but even these sequence of events were laughable where super human Sebastian is able to survive being set on fire, electrocution, and a metal bar being smacked square across his bonce.The only good thing about this film were the special effects. Kevin Bacon was a good presence for the most part and the likes of Shue and Brolin were also good in support.For me, this was a very hard film to like and not just because it's badly written, but it's also because it's so mean-spirited. What started out as a fairly intelligent film, quickly became reduced to a ridiculous game of hide and seek coupled with a stupid slash em up final act.

But he came from Europe to America in the very correct time. The man is a director for commercial movies. There is nothing wrong about that, but he came when the old formula for making the traditional flicks was in a new phase of development as the exaggeration in violence and sex was the recent profiteer ruler and OH BOY the right man was here to make the movies rock by the new (yet not very old) rock in town. The thing is not that the man (The Hollywood Man) is making that without no brain or no good satires or anything makes anybody think. No. He is such the entertaining entertainer and no more. No problem with that, however there would be a lot of problems if there is no entertainment there at all also (at least for me !). Look at the idea of that bold inventor who had tested his own dangerous invention on himself for the sake of science, greatness, money.. whatever and became invisible to have megalomania as a must supervene symptom. So he thought that he turned into a God (as he sees everybody and nobody can see him). All of that could have been a tragedy of a talented man or a good studying about a human who loses his humanity because of his own greed, narcissism or technology, or even a story about another criminals whom are visible unlike their crimes (the politician for instance) plus the assured nice action in the same time too BUT it turned out to be just another bloody flick which was full of unbearable violence and scary as hell, yet technically strong ; coming from one of Hollywood's most sincere men in making such a hollow movies which gain a lot of money for sure.

They have the ability to turn animals invisible, but up until now there has been no way to reverse it. Now, Sebastian has found a reversal formula, and it works.Sebastian, afraid his research will be stolen away from him, keeps all records of progress from the military. He is obsessed with power and he doesn't know what to do now that it's all over. (It feels like the beginning of the end, he says.)

He is afraid his colleagues will turn him in, and so he traps them underground and starts to kill them off, one-by-one.His fellow scientists include Linda (Elisabeth Shue, who somehow gets top billing over Bacon), Matthew (Josh Brolin), Sarah (Kim Dickens), Carter (Greg Grunberg), and Kramer (William Devane). Linda was his ex-lover sometime in the past. Now she's going out with Matthew. Sebastian doesn't like this; it's part of what triggers his ferocious outbreak in the first place. In short, the guy goes crazy and there's nothing they can do about it except pray and hunt him down with their little goggles and stun guns.Sebastian considers himself God. (How many times have I told you you're not God? I am.) We can tell from the beginning that he has problems with control and superiority. The serum, which has some serious side effects like those you hear in fine print on commercials for medicine, only unleashes his darker side he tries to conceal. And Verhoeven has a strong handle on the different phases of his personality change, unlike most films. Unforunately, whereas RoboCop and Total Recall seemed much more serious, Hollow Man, like his 1997 film Starship Troopers, feels too over-the-top and goofy for its own good. His earlier films always had a touch of that over-the-top action spectacular stuff. This one has too much.If there were ever a movie for Paul Verhoeven, it is this. It's the tailor-made film just for him, much like RoboCop was. He has free roam to create an invisible man who slowly becomes hostile and hunts his victims. Think about Total Recall--remember how Verhoeven's imaginations were perfectly displayed on screen? How real it all was? How gripping and suspenseful?There's something missing here. It's the perfect material for Verhoeven, and it has his distinctly hard edge, but it is dumb, and it feels more like an average slasher movie with a large budget than a smart thriller. Especially towards the end, which has its fun parts but becomes over-the-top and quite ridiculous. Of course, the bad guy always gets back up for one last scare, but (spoiler alert!) Sebastian gets up three times. And he's not even supernatural -- he's just invisible. He gets torched with a flamethrower, knocked over the head, electrocuted, and blown up his lab facility. Then he manages to climb up an elevator shaft and grab Linda one last time. HUH? And since when does electricity not spread through water? These guys are extremely advanced scientists, yet they never stop to ponder over why basic science knowledge has just been proved incorrect. I'm being too harsh. I won't lie. The film has its moments of interest and truly amazing special effects--some of the best I've ever seen in a motion picture, in fact. If Who Framed Roger Rabbit was an opening for live action/animation and Terminator 2 was the breakthrough motion picture for pure special effects, this is the next level. It starts with an intriguing premise, just as RoboCop and Total Recall did, only those two films kept elevating the action, suspense, plot, and emotional attachment, something that Hollow Man is lacking. Perhaps a better title would have been Hollow Movie?Hollow Man is rated R for strong violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.2.5/4. See it on TV.- John Ulmer "},{"Title":"What a disappointment!

Paul 'RoboCop' Verhoeven takes on The Invisible Man! This should have been a killer movie! Verhoeven made a string of brilliant movies back in the 1980s ('Spetters', 'The Fourth Man', 'Flesh & Blood', 'RoboCop'), and after losing his way slightly since working in Hollywood, his 'Starship Troopers' was a bit of a return to form, and things were really looking good. Now I don't know what happened, but 'Hollow Man' ended up being a major let down. The cast was good - Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth Shue, the underrated cutie Kim Dickens ('Zero Effect', 'Truth Or Consequences, NM'), even William Devane, an old favourite of mine (check out 'Rolling Thunder' sometime!) - the special effects were generally pretty impressive (scientifically illogical, but who cares), but the script! By the guy who gave us 'End Of Days', one of the dumbest of all dumb movies in recent years. The script stinks! Bacon tries his hardest, but compared to Claude Rains back in the 1930s, who derailed trains(!) and planned to rule the world, his Invisible Man is just a third rate heavy. Verhoeven in the past has really pushed the boundaries with sex, violence and black humour, so I really expected a LOT more from this, but it's difficult not to regard it as a lame sell out. And the silly climax, which is drawn out WAY too much, becomes totally ludicrous when Bacon's Invisible Man somehow starts looking like The Indestructable Man! It's so stupid that any drop of good feeling you had about what preceded it goes straight down the drain. This is a crappy movie made by a guy who used to be BRILLIANT! What went wrong I don't know, but along with Tim Burton's 'Planet Of The Apes' it's difficult to think of a more disappointing movie released this decade. 'Hollow Man' is a hollow movie, and to be avoided.

After careful consideration it can only be concluded that this is yet another example, provided courtesy of Hollywood, that awesome special effects do not make a good movie. A big budget of $95 million also won't get you a good movie. A glossy movie with slick production value maybe, but the good depends on what you do with it.Hollow Man takes an interesting premise that most of us have probably considered at one point or another. I was definitely considering it when I decided to watch this movie. The premise itself is simple what would you do if you were invisible? The possibilities here are plentiful so too bad that Hollow Man degenerates to a routine slasher flick. It's quite remarkable. The fantastic special effects that start the film first a mouse being eaten by an invisible creature with the blood splatter giving us some hint as to what ate it. Then the rendering visible of this creature via a counter injection to the invisibility serum we see the veins of a living creature begin to appear. Soon there is a whole map of a circulatory system, then of the muscles and finally we see a gorilla. Pretty cool and a great example of Hollywood magic. Of course this all takes place in one of those secret government labs that Hollywood has neatly hidden in every city, but that's hardly what is wrong with the movie.What's wrong is that they take this interesting idea that is given a great introduction and then just use it as an excuse for violence. The catch is that the killer is invisible so you can't see him and that's scary. Please, even when the killer in a slasher movie is visible he is hard to spot and has been since the slasher genre was born. I guess the only new thing here is that well lit areas can even hide the killer. Though that hardly provides anything interesting since it all leads to the same old violence. Also so much is made about this invisibility as a secret government experiment yet many logical things about the aspect of being invisible are totally ignored. That's quite a shame, since they at least could have created a slasher kill who's REALLY different and give us something new to see (or not see). They didn't. --- 4/10Rated R for violence and profanity.

The trailers to the film did not indicate it would be a horror movie. If I had known it was, I would have skipped it completely.One aspect of horror movies like this is that the victims are always helpless and never really fight back.

That's hardly an issue, though, since Paul Verhoeven himself as well seemed undetermined what genre of movie he wanted to make. Hollow Man starts off as a science-fiction thriller about a group of dedicated researchers working on a secret military weapon for the government that makes people completely invisible. When the leader of the group &#150; Sebastian Caine - then volunteers to be the first human guinea pig to experiment upon, the film suddenly turns into a raw social satire that mocks the typical human greed and the abuse of power. After yet another sudden change in tone, when Sebastian totally loses his grip on reality, Hollow Man becomes an ordinary horror film with a very violent climax and tons of cruel images. Due to all the sudden changes in ambiance, Verhoeven never really succeeds in bringing tension and involvement in his film, and it doesn't exactly make the story credible, neither. Sebastian's mental breakdown in particular is very unbelievable. Taking advantage of his invisible state to fool around a little is one thing, but brutally murdering his colleagues the next second is slightly too exaggerated. The film has absolutely no moral and Verhoeven &#150; as usual &#150; seems to focus more on the sexually perverted possibilities that invisibility offer. Every sequence eventually leads to voyeurism, rape-fantasies or the sexual triangulation between the head-doctors. Unnecessary to say that the very best aspects about Hollow Man are the visual effects. Perhaps the best use of special effect ever in a horror film, thus it's a bit of a shame they're wasted on such an inept story. The acting is very satisfying as well. Kevin Bacon is terrifically cast as the ego-maniacal and frustrated scientist and he's seemly having a great time portraying the bastard. Not bad, but unfortunately far from great.

State-of-the-art effects enhance the mood, with some suitably repulsive anatomical views early on, escalating to more-visceral gore in the climax. Kevin Bacon helps by creating one of his scariest creepy-guy characters, a villain who's fundamentally human, yet a real pleasure to hate.Sure, the storyline is obvious.

Sebastian Caine	It sure would be wondrous to become invisible; capable of marching around without the disadvantage of being seen by the naked eye. With our current technological revolution, invisibility could be possible in the near future. Hallow Man, the new suspense thriller from director Paul Verhoeven, looks into that very intriguing possibility, and does so with eye-popping visual effects. Unfortunately the movie losses most of its interest when the concepts become lost in yet another typical slasher movie.	The film stars Kevin Bacon as an obscene and egotistical scientist named Sebastian Caine. He uses himself to experiment on a new invisibility formula, it works, and he becomes even more fiendish, sex-crazed, and eventually even murderous. But not without probable cause his fellow scientists, including Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue), Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin), Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens), Carter Abbey (Greg Grunberg), Frank Chase (Joey Slotnick), and Janice Walton (Mary Randle), along with a Pentagon official, Dr. Howard Kramer (William Devane), all believe the treatments cause negative reactions in his body. Therefore, in order to eliminate the intentions of halting the project entirely, Caine reverts to grisly serial killer, murdering everyone involved with the scientific studies. 	I found Hallow Man undesirable for numerous reasons, one of them centering on the Kevin Bacon character himself. He starts off as a devilish lunatic and turns into an even more devilish lunatic. If was a more significant change in his character, we may have been more surprised when the film becomes preoccupied with endless amounts of bloodshed and graphic violence. The scientific invisibility concept is just a gimmick to pump new energy into an old retread the slasher movie. There is some merit here the killer's intentions are clear, the violence is focused, and the characters are smart in more ways than one. However, the film adds nothing new into the increasingly desperate genre. 	Hallow Man also lacks terror and suspense. Similar to Paul Verhoeven's previous features, like the unquestionably violent but flat RoboCop, Total Recall and Starship Troopers, there is plenty of violent content in here, but where is the tension? The energy buildup? The suspenseful sequences? They do not exist. There is so much potential in the writer's ideas it's too bad the film does not amount to more than mindless blood and gore. 	The special effects are outstanding. They can not be nearly described, but must be seen to believe. Is Hallow Man worth seeing for the half dozen or so sequences portraying Oscar nominated visual effects? Not really. On a mechanical and technical level this movie is outstanding, I just wish the filmmakers took more time in writing surreal scenes and developing nail-biting suspense than finding remarkable special effects artists.

That`s probably why I didn`t quite catch Dr Seb`s motivation for wanting to kill his colleagues - I was asleep .

For example if you set this on a space staion and had an alien on board you could have had more or less the same movie with the exact same set pieces  , or have a shape changing alien on an Antartic base , or have some naughty teenagers stuck in a creepy house with a supernatural serial killer .
