At first I was thinking just another foolish sequel and I have to admit that at one point it more or less even looked like U.S. Marshals is basically the same film than The Fugitive but only with Wesley Snipes in the shoes of Harrison Ford. But this is the real and the final truth  from what I remember The Fugitive was like I never considered it as all that great but since I was definitely on the edge of my seat with U.S. Marshals only logical thing would be to assume that this was naturally a better movie.I tried to avoid U.S. Marshals for many years (I've no idea why) but now when I finally saw it I was stunned by it. Interesting detail about this film as well as The Fugitive too is the peculiar fact that during the movie audience can't never really decide who's side their sympathies actually are and which one do they want to succeed the innocent fugitive or Tommy Lee Jones' eminent marshal because clearly they're both equally heroes. U.S. Marshals is not a special thriller but it works splendidly as what it is and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Tommy Lee Jones is the ultimate star of the movie but Snipes is also pretty excellent as Sheridan. When you think of U.S. Marshals the impressive scene where Sheridan jumps onto the roof of a moving subway is already a classic. Still I'm sure that's not necessarily the only scene audience remembers. I don't know what you think but U.S. Marshals was a fine experience for me.

In this film, the focus is on the team that was searching for Dr. Richard Kimble in the first movie. That team was led by Tommy Lee Jones, who won an Oscar for his performance, which probably helped spur this sequel. It worked, as Jones and company (Joe Pantoliano and others) are just as much fun to watch as they were in The Fugitive.There are many similarities to the latter, especially in the first third of the film, featuring some tremendous action scenes. Instead of a train crash, we have a plane crash. Instead of Harrison Ford on the run, we have Wesley Snipes. In both films, you have such an involving story that the two hours fly by.U.S Marshals, being the newer film of the two, has better sound and even better special effects for the action scenes. As spectacular as was the train crash in The Fugitive, the plane disaster in here is even better. The same goes for a few other scenes. There is more action in this film. Normally, I don't need that but it's so well-done here, it's fine....fun to watch.The Fugitive is still one of my all-time favorite movies. If you were entertained by it as well but are wary of sequels, you needn't be here this is excellent.

However, I had forgotten that I thought The Fugitive was a useless remake of the TV series until I was dragged to it and found&#133;a fine, suspenseful feature filled with a plethora of colorful characters. So, I should have been tuned in more to my own personal history, but so it goes&#133;.I now have watched U.S. Marshalls a number of times, and I have to say the two companion films match each other in quality.The pacing is fast without being frenetic. The use of repetition, i.e., recurring motifs such as Kimball diving off a dam to safety & Sheridan swinging down to hop a commuter train, work well &#150; though they could have been disastrous. The large cast is compelling down to the smallest roles (similar to The Fugitive in that regard). Jones, Snipes, and Downey all show range in their parts&#133;Downey, as always, illustrates why he is one of the best of his generation. And some of the secondary roles shine, in particular Tom Wood as Deputy Marshall Noah Newman. He receives more screen time than in the predecessor; and he makes use of it well. He has one of those acting moments in a confrontation with Downey's character his intense expression of simultaneous fear & anger is a plum bit of acting chops. Like other IMDb readers, I wonder what has happened with this good actor. No screen credits since 2000. Stage work? Left the biz? If the former, and he's in NYC, then we'll probably see him on a Law & Order episode one of these days! I recently found a DVD with tons of extras on it &#150; but I have not as yet delved into them.

There is no skimping on the action and the leap from a building to a moving train is one nifty stunt.  The only trouble I have is that you don't care enough about Wesley Snipes' character as you do for Harrison Ford in The Fugitive.  Wesley Snipes is a former spy in the film, and he uses his skills to evade the cops.  Ford was just a doctor, with no special training at all.  Still, for an action film, this one delivers.

Mark Sheridan has escaped from a plane wreck and is on the run for a crime he did not commit and Gerard, with his team, is close behind. Sheridan must find a way to avoid the Marshals and find out who really committed the crime he has been framed for. The action is well placed coming in short spurts (except for maybe the plane wreck) and works exceptionally well with the story.The acting is exceptionally well done with Jones and Snipes giving some of there best performers in a long time. Tommy Lee Jones is quick thinking and likable in his role as Gerard and eventually works into be your favorite character. Snipes is only seen in short spirits until about the last 20 minutes which adds to the effect of him being evasive to the Marshalls. However, in his short scenes, he is able to fit into the role with relative ease.The action sequences, as I said, is very well done and never over done. They are fast-paced and well acted. The special effects are also quite believable. With the excellent acting, gripping plot, and fast paced action sequences, the two hours fly by and make for a very enjoyable film.3 1/2/5 Stars "}{"Title":"Not As Good As The Fugitive But Still A Fantastic Sequel, With Tense And Exciting Action, And 2 Amazing Performances From Tommy Lee Jones And Wesley Snipes!","Date":"28 October 2005","Score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" This is not as good as The Fugitive but it's still fantastic sequel, with tense and exciting action and 2 amazing performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes!.

Here, the journey of Marshal (Samuel Gerard) continues, yet with another fugitive. Most of Hollywood sequels are badly-written, pretty hasty, and repeating its original at best. But this time, it even outclassed its original. (The Fugitive) was well-made entertainment, however too long, somehow uninteresting with Mr. Ford, not to mention that I remember falling asleep in front of it at the first watching! While I have been hooked by (U.S. Marshals), for countless times.(Tommy Lee Jones) returns to the character that brought him the Oscar. That reminded me of (Charles Laughton) when he won the Oscar for portraying (Henry VIII) in (The Private Life of Henry VIII - 1933), then returned to the same character again in (Young Bess - 1953). There is a certain love for the Oscar's part I suppose. Yet, aside from that, I believe (Jones) loved to come back because how he and (Gerard) are very damn alike. The first always says I do not have a sense of humor of any recognizable sort, (Harrison Ford) said once Acting with him is like having a fork in your back all the time, and (Will Smith) has stated that He's my buddy, but it's hard to be a friend of someone who doesn't lie at all !. So I think (Tommy), one way or another, was playing himself. Or maybe he gave the character a lot of his own.I liked the character's reactions. When he was told He's dangerous, armed, well-trained, what will you intent to do?, he replayed simply and seriously  catch him !, not catch him badly or the son of bitch is mine or I'm the one who's going to learn this sucker the meaning of PAIN ! to the end of the Dirty Harry, SuperCops, I'm The Man dictionary in any other American action. Or when he was among the investigators in (Irene Jacob)'s apartment, notice well that he doesn't speak unless for harmless remakes, looking the most kind or naive one in the bunch till the end of the scene. Or when he comes to his senses near the climax, choosing not to kill the fugitive. Over and above, (Jones) mastered some good physical efforts as well. However (Jones) is accused of repeating himself. While being a master actor, every now and then he's forced to do the same thing again. For instance he was the man who chases the innocent till he catches him then convinces his innocence in (The Fugitive). Then the same man yet with a love interest and a desire to avenge in (U.S. Marshals). Then he sort of remade it again yet with a fugitive woman in (Double Jeopardy). And he did it once more with less talk and more action in (The Hunted) ! It's full of perfect chases. The long sequence in the movie's middle is superb (I don't remember anything like it in The Fugitive !). The problem is that the climax looks so pale compared to it. All the cast did their best. Yes, (Irene Jacob) was nothing but the escapee's charming scared girl (The way most of the American movies deal with talented European actresses). But what the heck, it's an action, and nothing wrong with seeing such a sensitive eyeful like her in it. OH MY GOD she looked uniquely sexy in that short black dress and that short black hair too. The dialog was close to spontaneous; representing hot, honest and funny moments (all the conversations between Jones & Joe Pantoliano). This script was accurate. Even the idiot points, such as arresting Wesley Snipes' character because of the medicine he takes, have been presented fast enough so you couldn't glimpse. No wonder, since director (Stuart Baird) was originally one of Hollywood top-notch editors for 2 decades before becoming a director in the mid-90s.I recall the authentic poster in the video store back then. It had just small photo for (Jones) looking sullen and the rest of it was for (Snipes) jumping from the roof. I bet the movie makers were proud of themselves for make this astonishing stunt in specific. Although it got my admiration, but I have to hate the fact that the movie gave up one shot in which (Snipes) salutes (Jones) sarcastically a la' military way while he's above the train; I deem it the best finish to this outrageous sequence. Though you'd never find it unless in the movie's trailer !OK, now for something magical. While I watched the movie 3 times already I didn't notice something that even at the fourth time my mom was the one who noticed it and told me; after (Jones) discovered the truth of (Downey. Jr) he tricks him like adept magician, emptying (Downey)'s gun in front of him, and us, while no one is looking. The thing is how (Jones) was that charismatic to pull the trick off so I - a pro viewer I think - didn't observe this, and for many times too ?! It seems that the director betted on (Jones)'s presence and he, clearly, won.Finally, I liked the movie's sense of honoring; starting from the slightly strange title, to the last scene with Jerry Goldsmith's tune crowns the victorious marshals. Yes, it's a sequel, straight action, Hollywood stuff but not with the bad reputation of that. And (Jones), (Gerard) both were great.

Well for starters it's got Tommy Lee Jones who could've made plan 9 from outer space a great movie. The Story is almost similar to The Fugitive and many people pointed it out and called this a rehash. Well it is not a rehash. Sam Gerald serves as a U.S. Marshal he is a fugitive chaser that's his specialty. That's what makes him a legend. So what did they think Gerald would be doing in this movie? Chasing Hannibal lecter? The crux of the movie is this. Wesley Snipes in a over the top kind of role plays Mark Sheriden a former CIA agent on the run after being framed for the murder of two agents who were selling secrets to the Chinese. Sheriden is on the run and is caught and shipped back home via con air meanwhile Sam Gerald is on that same flight escorting a prisoner he wholloped while wearing handcuffs. Gerald witnesses a murder attempt on Sheriden and the botched job results in the whole plane crashing in the Louisana bayou. Sheriden escapes. Gerald is saddled with a department of justice agent named John Royce(Wonderfully played by the always talented and able Robert Downey JR) Royce does not fit in at first Gerald's Marshals resent having to babysit a fed.But Royce soon shows them he's anything but normal he's got a vendetta against Sheriden and for a good reason and he wants him dead. That's the Story in a nutshell and it does not sound anything even remotely like the Fugitive. In fact I wanted them to call this the further adventures of Sam Gerald just because people hold fast onto weird ideas about sequels and they believe it's got to be the same as the first. This movie is stylishy made the stunts are great the story is solid and the acting is top notch. What more does anyone want? It's a popcorn kind of movie you sit back and it does what it sets out to do for you and that is entertain you. This movie exceeded all of my expectations when I first saw it because I thought Yeah it'll be another innocent doctor he's chasing this time. but man they tossed me a curve ball I never saw coming They made two totally different movies. Once you get your head wrapped around that concept and you get used to the idea and really really accept it. You will understand that and you'll thank me for recommending a movie that will NOT Waste your Time. U.S.Marshalls is another entirely different movie it just happens to have the cop from the Fugitive in it and this time Sam Gerald is the central figure the movie is about him. Thank God it was about time. U.S.Marshalls will not disappoint you if you are a Fugitive fan. It's just giving you more of what you want.

Wesley Snipes plays the fugitive on the lam, and Tommy Lee Jones is once again the man on his trail. Unlike the first one with Harrison Ford, Wesley Snipes plays a ex-Marine who accused of killing two DSS Agents. However, when they bring along Special Agent John Royce(Robert Downey, Jr.), the story goes deeper. Samuel Gerard(Jones) wants the fugitive alive, Royce on the other hand wants him dead! The New York scene is what I like. I like the part where Mark(Snipes) escapes death when he fights Royce, and Royce kills Newman(Tom Wood) before his death, he sees that Royce is no good. And I liked the part where Mark swings on down to the train station on a cable. That's what I call an adrenaline rush. Imagine, if Sam Gerard went out and killed Mark Roberts, he would have sorry. Quick-thinking came in handy when he found out about Royce, and his hard-core, hard-nosed attitude saved the day. I'm very surprised that he forgave Mark for shooting him. If he didn't shoot Gerard, he would've been still in jail. Well, a sequel was worth making, and it was a lot of fun to watch all the way through. Go for it, and see it! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!

What ends up happening feels too much like recycled material from the first, a surprising villain, chase sequences through out buildings, and of course the major stunts. Jones shines in his role once again as the hardened detective, but he feels different from The Fugitive. There his acting style was fresh and hard core, here it's just one of those other serious, tough roles. As the man being hunted, Snipes adds in some sympathy but overall generates a feeling of attempting to be like Harrison Ford. A new cast member is added in, Robert D. Jr. who also plays a Marshal. His role is refreshing as a cocky cop who just wants to get up there like Jones. The direction remains the same as the first one, and definitely needs some polish. However, the script works in the same level as the first and even though it feels the same the characters are still well- written. The first one received several Oscar nominations and a win for Best Supporting Actor, but this one didn't get anything. However, I feel D. should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor.

After a few days, you can really start to pick it to pieces.  This makes it not a great movie, but not a bad one either.The movie whilst billed as a sequel to the fugitive, really bears no resemblance to the 1st installment other than Tommy Lee Jones returns as Samuel Gerard.  This time Samuel Gerard is more of an action hero than the intriguing character of the fugitive.  Wesley Snipes  replaces Harrison Ford as the innocent hero this time.  Snipes character Mark Sheridan is special opps who has been hung out to dry and spends the movie attempting to prove his innocence.  Gerard of course catches on early on that there is more to the chase than meets the eye.Joe Pantoliano and Daniel Roebuck are both handy supportiung deputies. Pantoliano provides some of the better comic moments of the movie with his dialogie with Jones.Robert Downey Jnr plays the hero come villain in the movie.  I like Downey Jnr, and it is a pity that in real life he is having a helter scelter ride with his drug problems.  In this movie he plays John Royce who as the movie moves on is clearly not the nice guy we are lead to believe he is..  This is the disappointing element of the movie. The writing was on the wall from very early on that Downey Jnr was the villain, and this took a fair amount of the suspense from the movie.The action sequence at the beginning of the movie and the plane crash sequence are right up there with actionmovie openings.Overall a good action movie, with a plot that is a little disappointing.

It's a pseudo-sequel to 'The Fugitive', but don't think that it's the same film all over again. 'US Marshalls' is a perfect stand-alone film, meaning you can watch this film and enjoy it without having seen 'The Fugitive' first.Tommy Lee Jones plays an excellent grizzled US Marshall who's generally at war with the world. But he enjoys his work- 'c'mon fellas, I'm not having any fun here! And you know how I get when I'm not having fun!' Seeing such a rough-tough character dressed in a chicken suit at the beginning of the film is great comedy.After a plane carrying criminals crash lands on a road, then a river, TLJ takes control and rescues most of the crim's from drowning- they're chained in their seats, you see. Next morning, the local incompetent sheriff comes in to 'take control'. Comedy ensues when the sheriff tries to show his skills- 'I want you setting up roadblocks in a big, kinda, circle deal.' Of course, when they find one bad guy missing, the hunt is on!The FBI also want to help catch this guy, for reasons which become clear whilst watching the film. To help, they assign an agent to the US Marshall team, played by Robert Downy Jr, who isn't all he seems...The plot revolves around the selling of secrets by the US, and China's involvement. Wesley Snipes plays a good guy set up for bad reasons, who takes the chance to leg it away from the plane and clear his name. He has a little help from his friends, including his girlfriend who's part in the film is never made clear. This is also true for the US Marshalls head, who seems to express feelings for TLJ for one sentence, and then plays no further part.This film is definitely a psychological thriller. You have to keep an eye (or two) on the plot and the characters at all times. I watched this film twice and enjoyed it more the second time- you catch all the little nuances you might otherwise miss. I recommend you do the same.This film is too deep to accurately describe in a short review, but I would recommend to anyone who likes films with depth, and enjoys characters who seem real, and have strong personalities of their own.

This time, replacing Harrison Ford, is Wesley Snipes. One thing that does strike me as strange is the crash. Both films have a crash where our hero escapes. In the first film, Ford sees his bus crash as a chance to escape. This time, Snipes sees his plane crash as a chance. That lowers marks as it shows the writers lack of creativity. Snipes and L.Jones both do well in their roles. Hollywood bad boy Robert Downey Jnr adds support as L.Jones' assistant. As does Joe Pantoliano(bad boys) and Tom Wood(under siege). The story is basic, but well performed. Snipes is framed for  murder and chooses to go on the run as Tommy Lee Jones has to track him down. The acting is pleasing enough, so is the story.

This film is an efficient package full of action, knockout thrills, and suspense driven entertainment.  The cast works well together and newcomer Stuart Baird (whose only previous directing experience was EXECUTIVE DECISION) has managed to cleverly direct several action scenes.  U.S. MARSHALS is a smashing success that has earned its recognition as a creditable action film.  Mark Sheridan (Wesley Snipes) is an ordinary man *framed* for a ghastly crime he did not commit.  Sheridan consistently proclaims his innocence but after surviving (and escaping) a nearly fatal plane crash, he finds himself another fugitive on the loose...  It is up to U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, reprising his Oscar winning role) to track down this elusive fugitive and of course, capture him.  This task will not be easy...  Gerard has learned that the man he is after is wanted for the murder of two federal agents.  Gerard has his hands full trying to pursue this rather stealthy fugitive.  Just when Gerard has enough problems to deal with already, an ally he considers a neophyte, Special Agent John Royce (Robert Downey Jr.) has been obligated to assist Gerard and his U.S. Marshals... From the hidden swamps to the populated city, Gerard and his team are on a cat-and-mouse hunt after Mark Sheridan...  U.S. MARSHALS works primarily for two reasons.  First, the performances are believable and second, the action sequences are fiercely choreographed with expertise and grace.  Character development is well planned out also.  Tommy Lee Jones is terrific as the cynical U.S. Marshal Gerard who always gets cranky when he is not having any fun.  Gerard knows who he is after and he is always determined to nail his suspect under any circumstances.  Though Jones does not deliver an Oscar-caliber performance this time, he knows the character of Sam Gerard only too well.  Robert Downey Jr. is surprisingly confident as a special agent who has his own agenda.  Wesley Snipes is remarkably good too as the main character who is dedicated to clearing his own name.  Snipes's character is not nearly as sympathetic as Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford), but he is a cool, intelligent guy nonetheless.  It's good that this hero relies on his judgment more than his emotions.  Even if Snipes may not win as much applause from the audience as Harrison Ford originally did, this character is still respectable. The reason for this gap in the audiences' sympathy between the two fugitives is that Kimball has tragically lost a loved one.  He faces the horror of losing his wife to a serial killer.  In this way, audiences can commiserate with the suffering Kimball has gone through while trying to elude from the law.  On the other hand, Roberts is wanted for the murder of two guys whom the audiences hardly get to meet.  The audiences may root for the hero, but they could personally care less about the victims who were allegedly murdered in `cold blood' by Roberts.  Neither the main character Roberts nor the audiences can feel much substantial pain for the loss of these two agents...  U.S. MARSHALS is ferocious entertainment.  The action sequences are great and riveting.  From the spectacular plane crash insinuating Roberts's escape to a character's daring leap (while holding on to a dangling cord) onto the top of a moving train, U.S. MARSHALS is extremely enjoyable. Like any other decent thriller, U.S. MARSHALS still has a few shortcomings.  The plot is too convoluted for its own good.  Halfway through the movie, audiences may begin to be perplexed as more unnecessary characters are implicated into this case.  This film could also afford to lose its contrived sub-plot about U.S. and foreign relations and not lose too much of its punch.  Also, Snipes does not have as much appeal as the original fugitive, but both characters are nevertheless winningly laudable. As far as chase thrillers are concerned, U.S. MARSHALS ranks above the rest.  It is almost up to par with THE FUGITIVE.  U.S. MARSHALS is a fine sequel; it is reasonably fast paced and always nail biting.  It is an aggressive, skillfully made thriller with a capable cast,  noteworthy action, and a complex series of events.  Enjoy!  RATING *** out of ****.

In films like The Fugitive, Men In Black, The Hunted, Three Burials, US Marshals, In The Valley of Elah, The Missing, In The Electric Mist and No Country For Old Men (though there he is mockingly cast as an inept tracker), Jones plays a consummate blood-hound, a man bred for hot pursuit. He is typically without attachments, stern but witty, authoritative and forever determined to apprehend his prey. US Marshalls sticks to this formula, but some solid action sequences, a brisk pace, many one-liners and some likable side characters (Marshals rightly recognises that the coolest characters in The Fugitive were Tommy Lee Jones and his motor-mouthed gang) keeps things fun.US Marshal's best scene? A riff on Gene Hackman's Santa suit sequence in The French Connection, in which Tommy Lee Jones conducts a pursuit and stakeout whilst dressed as a giant yellow chicken.

I liked the original The Fugitive, so I decided to watch this sequel, and see how it goes. I was quite surprised at how much it was like a remake than a sequel. Well, Tommy Lee Jones is superb reprising his role as Gerard, but it kinda lacks the escapist touch of the original, but still quite exciting. Lee Jones is still superb, Wesley Snipes is okay too. The film is more of a remake than a sequel, mainly because Gerard goes after another fugitive, and director Stuart Baird (Executive Decision) doing some changes. This time, the fugitive is supposed to be linked with a deadly spy ring. He escapes from an out-of-control 727 plane (it was a bus in the original) and pursued by Gerard at every turn. Overall, it closely resembles the escapist plot of it's predecessor. But still, I like it. It's edgy and exciting. Good for a popcorn movie or a movie for a boring night.Rating ***1/2 out of 5.

Such is the case for this viewer with US MARSHALS, a film made in 1998 but one that remains one of the finest of the genre of chase thrillers.The story is well-known to everyone by now Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is accompanying a planeful of criminals to maximum security - among them is Mark J. Sheridan (Wesley Snipes) who is actually the most wanted and dangerous of the crew. The plane crashes and Sheridan escapes, beginning what amounts to one of the most harrowing and dare devilish chases on film. Along the way the US Marshals (including Joe Pantoliano, Daniel Roebuck, Tom Wood, LaTanya Richardson, and Kate Nelligan) with a 'help' from a Special Agent (Robert Downey Jr.) help track Sheridan only to find that Sheridan is himself a special agent etc etc etc. The action scenes are intense an beautifully captured and edited. The ensemble acting is first rate. There is some fine love interest thanks to the presence of the beautiful Irène Jacob and some intrigue involving Michael Paul Chan as a Chinese attaché. The only flaw in the script is that old Hollywood problem of assigning a major star like Robert Downey Jr. to what seems like a minor role, a dead giveaway as to who the real bad guy is going to be.But in all this film is a tense, well-paced and photographed and scored action flick that wears well with time.

The film seems like a total bore to me, with its flat action sequences and still flatter acting by its lead, Harrison Ford. I have a hard time understanding Harrison's appeal as well. His expressions typically run the gamut from grimace to grim, and in The Fugitive he failed to stir a rooting interest in me--a crucial failure in a movie of this kind. To understand the difference, I think it would be prudent to revisit the original TV drama starring David Janssen. Janssen, a workmanlike, competent actor, evoked tremendous sympathy simply on the basis of his facial characteristics alone. Although the program followed a formulaic dramatic arc from episode to episode, viewers were able to closely identify with this wrongly accused Everyman who was forced to live on the fringes of society, always afraid, always on the run. For me, there is no such sense of identification with the Dr. Kimball of the movie remake.Apparently, U.S. Marshalls was intended as a sequel to `The Fugitive,' with Tommy Lee Jones reprising his role as Deputy Marshall Gerard. In my opinion, his character is better fleshed out here than it was previously. His humanity is much more apparent, and in this movie his sense of humor comes through with greater ease. Wesley Snipes plays the fugitive role this time, and once again, his character is falsely accused of a crime he did not commit. He goes on the lam, after the plane on which he is being transported crash lands and comes to rest, belly up, in a swamp. Snipes character is not as clearly innocent as Dr. Kimball was, adding a frisson to this movie that the first film lacked. In fact, the narrative of this movie is quite complex, including double and triple crosses, political chicanery in high places, and enough plausible plot twists to maintain interest throughout.The action sequences are improved here as well. It's apparent the producers wanted to take the stunt work so amply featured in `The Fugitive' and go it one better. So, where we had a spectacular train crash in the former, we have a spectacular plane crash in the latter. The major difference? The action sequences simply work better in the latter film. The plane crash for example, is an extremely exciting, well-executed, and entirely believable action sequence. What sets it apart from the train sequence in `The Fugitive' is that it is clearly a far more complex sequence to execute. After the sequence begins, you get the feeling it will go on forever, but you're mesmerized, glued to the action as if you were witnessing.well, witnessing a plane crash. Even the much-vaunted sequence within The Fugitive, where Dr, Kimball jumps from the dam spillway, is eclipsed here by Wesley Snipes rappelling from a rooftop onto the top of a moving train.And the producers also outdid themselves with their choice of an excellent cast to play the secondary characters. Robert Downey, Jr. holds his own as a Federal Agent, seconded to Deputy Gerard's team, and made to feel entirely unwelcome by his temporary boss. The movie also makes interesting use of the two women who play the friends and lovers of the two principals. Kate Nelligan, looking almost as incredibly beautiful as she did when she was a young woman, plays Deputy Gerard's boss, who also happens to be in love with him. This plot point is played down, but the emotions are true, believable, and well integrated into the action. And in a surprise bit of casting, Irene Jacob, one of France's most beautiful and capable actresses, plays the love interest of Wesley Snipes.I don't usually wax so enthusiastically about examples of the action/thriller genre, but this is a successful realization of the type, and it seems to me it's gotten the short end of the stick in its unfavorable comparisons to `The Fugitive.' I know I would have never purposely watched this movie because I recalled the critical drubbing it got when it was first released.

Thats maybe nitpicking to some people but I think its really an out and out mistake. This 1998 film is highly derivative of the 1993 film The Fugitive where the same US Marshal team initially appears. I thought the remake of the 1947 film (it was also a mid 1960's TV series) The Fugitive in 1993 with Harrison Ford was a watchable movie but this one is a bit too similar to that 1993 film to really be called original-I think. Nonetheless fans of action films will appreciate the action in this one. Not a classic but more or less OK.

Directed by Stuart Baird who previously made the lackluster Executive Decision but he can deliver on action. What he doesn't deliver on is a screenplay that is worth the time and money to produce. Even had Ford agreed to sign on, this film would have basically been a recycled piece of crap worthy of a bullet hole. Jones is basically reciting his Oscar winning role from The Fugitive and despite his efforts it is very dull. Snipes is not as interesting as what Harrison Ford was in The Fugitive. He has the physical capabilities but not the dramatic power here to make viewers care. Robert Downey Jr. is brought in to assist with the case but he is basically unnecessary. Joe Pantoliano and Kate Nelligan also get mixed in with this half ass sequel and both could only wish that they had not missed the bus with the first film.

But when Diplomatic Security Agent John Royce (Robert Downey Jr) is assigned to help Gerard recapture Sheridan, it becomes obvious he is not just your average escaped convict.One of the things that disappointed me with this was Lee Jones's character seemed to be there for comic relief in the first half of the movie. Wesley Snipes is more of an action man, than Ford's everyman but it's no bad thing. Downey Jr was OK, Joe Pantoliano once again offers superb support.

What attracted me to The Fugitive was Richard Kimble's story fleshed up by Harrison Ford and truckloads of action. Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard stood out and was essential to the overall balance but you would not say that this supporting character was more interesting than the fugitive.Action packed as it is US Marshals lacks a deeper characterisation of Gerard. His team, his temper, his buoyancy, his tidy boss... these are nice touches but don't really build something more than the character we already saw in the previous movie.You can take the two impressive action sequences apart and they just look like another blockbuster's tour de force. In the course of the movie they are not set up as a tension peak, they mostly happen as scripted. Surely there are too many nice/interesting characters to follow (Tommy Lee Jones and 2-3 prominent members of his team, Robert Downey Jr, Wesley Snipes and his lover Irène Jacob) so the editing rhythm is bogged down. The pace is simply not as fast as it should be for action to play to the max.Another big flaw is the 'New Fugitive' character arc we don't know him from the get-go - whereas the premise of the original Fugitive was about an innocent man accused of his wife's murder and relentlessly tracked down - and then new elements are added that don't draw a clear picture of who he is - and if he is really innocent ! Most notably it is clear soon enough that he is not just your average man hence empathy and rooting for him can never reach the required level for suspension of disbelief to work (I am especially thinking of the graveyard shooting, a sequence setup which looks blatantly haphazard for such big professional boys).Too bad they rushed such a script into production to poach on the Fugitive real-estate. They didn't need to have another nice innocent fugitive - especially given this protracted macguffin of a plot. Sam Gerard should have been the sole hero, attempting to stop more than a prisoner on the loose, and we should have had a better insight into the man's soul.

That's exactly what producers of The Fugitive did with Tommy Lee Jones' law enforcer, Sam Gerard.You shift the focus from the fugitive and place it on the men put in charge of catching him. They didn't want to veer too far off the beaten path, so you still have to have an innocent man running for his life and he has to have some type of star power. When U.S. Marshals came out in 1998, Wesley Snipes was a hot commodity and seemed like the perfect choice to play the role of the sympathetic man on the lamb.As an action film, this gets the job done. It does its best to be as good as The Fugitive but not get stuck trying to one-up it or be better. There's the obvious attempt at making the wreck in U.S. Marshals more of a spectacle by having the vehicle be an airplane instead of a passenger train. Besides that, it just seemed like director Stuart Baird wanted to make a good old fashioned crime caper with some mystery injected. Most viewers might be lost as to what the actual item causing all the trouble or the motivation for the whole movie is.

Check.-- All the original team members with Gerard? Check.-- Big dog reference and Biggs barking? Check.-- Newman has to make a tough call and then shoot (just as Gerard had to in an incident Newman was involved in)? Check.-- A Harrison Ford type of actor with good he-man and action credentials to balance Gerard? Check - I knew Wesley Snipes would be good in this, having seen him in Passenger 57.-- A Jeroen Krabbe (Dr. Charles Nichols) actor who can be a superbly civilized and erudite office dweller and yet be tough and macho enough to believably fight and almost beat both Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes? Check - Robert Downey, Jr. may have hated doing this picture, but he is superb in it.-- The same sort of edge-of-your-seat action, camera work, and story that takes you over the weak parts (yes, there were some of those in The Fugitive, too)? Check.It has a couple of problems, too -- that chicken suit, for one thing, and the silly search among pill boxes in the drug store. Also, Snipes' role and predicament depend too much on verbal explanations and not enough on showing it to the audience, as happened in The Fugitive. The plane crash is excellent, though. And unlike The Fugitive, the action in US Marshals takes place in two major cities and a southern swamp, which is not something most film makers try to do. It's ambitious, and it works very well here. In fact, the big fight with Jones and Snipes takes place first up in the air and then down below the waterline, and at that point you're so focused on the two men, it could be happening anywhere. That's good storytelling there.One line I wish they could have put in but didn't, as it wouldn't have fit Gerard's mental state at that point He did a Douglas Fairbanks right off this roof! Right here! That was a terrific stunt, and is even more appreciated, knowing that it was done just like it played out.If there were any justice in the world, this would have spawned a hit TV series.

I was very young, we saw it the next day after it had been released, so 2 May 1998. It was a sunny day like the movie. After the movie. The thing makes me remember that day is the movie U.S. Marshals. I loved the film and still haven't changed my mind. There are a few movies which make 1990's action crime cinema unique and this is one of them. I haven't forgotten the scene which Tommy Lee Jones wears a yellow rooster costume. The scene is very funny and also enjoyable. When he sees action in front of the house, he stares at them, I like that moment. However, U.S. Marshals is not a comedy, action, the rest of the movie is very serious. The Fugitive was excellent, but this is almost as great as the first one which many people disagree with. In some movies, the bad guy is paper tiger, honestly, in recent action movies, I see such bad guys more frequent, but on this count, this movie rocks. The fugitive is Wesley Snipes. John Cutter of Passenger 57, Simon Phoenix of Demolition Man. I think this is enough. Therefore, Sam Gerard comes up against an intractable man. He is more hard case than Richard Kimble. In other words, Wesley Snipes is a very good choice for our second fugitive to me. The plane crash scene was unforgettable, although we have seen a lot of similar scenes. It is not special, but I like it very much. By the way, after the accident, the set design is dazzling, very detailed. This is one of the movies which use New York city excellently, we see New York from panoramic views, day and night. When Wesley Snipes is on the rooftop, he looks down and sees police cars while parking, I like those moments, the camera angles, stylish. U.S. Marshals is a stylish movie from the first minute till the last, not only this scene. My favorite action scene starts in the graveyard that recalls Assassins, but much better than it and then the main pursuit begins. In the end, the train scene is also one of my favorites.

(The other 50%, obviously, was Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble.) They were correct in at least one regard; 'U.S. Marshals' grossed about half of what 'The Fugitive' did. So it's sort of a sequel but not really. More like the continuing adventures of some of the same characters. At first anyway, it certainly seems like a re-hash of 'The Fugitive.' There are many similar scenes. A character played by Wesley Snipes (who herewith will be called 'Snipes,' as he has three different names in the movie), is arrested on a relatively minor charge, then is revealed to be a suspect in the murder of two federal agents, and so is put on a plane with several other prisoners for New York, where he will stand trial. Instead of a spectacular train wreck, we get a spectacular plane crash. Snipes escapes. There is a huge investigation at the crash scene. Snipes makes his way down a river with forests on either side as a massive manhunt ensues. He hijacks vehicles and professes his innocence while always staying one step ahead of his pursuers. Any of this sound familiar? But whereas we were amazed in 'The Fugitive' at Richard Kimble's varied and ingenious ways of evading capture, here more often than not, our mouths drop open at the almost determinedly inept methods with which Gerard and his team fail to capture Snipes and other suspects. It's almost as if they are aware they are in a movie and if they catch him too soon, the movie will be over. Anything, even the slightest thing, that can prevent them from cornering Snipes, does. Taxis, stoplights, dressing rooms, walk/don't walk signs, bad traffic, pedestrians, diplomatic immunity... Gerard and his underlings seem to actively seek them out so they don't get their hands on the guy too quickly. At one point, Gerard on his cellphone even TELLS an assistant who is following Snipes' girlfriend that Snipes is in the dressing room with her. So what does the assistant do? He sticks his head in the dressing room, sees no one but the girl, apologizes and then leaves. (Snipes is in the room behind it.) So much of this goes on for so long that we feel like screaming at the screen. What then is worthwhile in 'U.S. Marshals?' Tommy Lee Jones is fine as always, in the kind of role he was born to play, again and again and again. Kate Nelligan is fun as his boss, giving him hell at times, then unexpectedly backing him up when we least expect it. The always interesting Robert Downey Jr. introduces a new character, a federal agent assigned to assist Gerard, and his actions at the end provide something of a surprise twist. There are some nice action scenes, like the aforementioned plane crash and some well-staged shootouts. But it is the confused pursuit of Snipes and a Chinese operative that ultimately ruins the film. After a while, the audience is left scratching its collective head, wondering what the hell the Feds want to accomplish and why they are going about it the way they are.

If you ask me, Mark (Wesley Snipes) was a very desperate man out to prove the fact that he didn't do what the feds thought. This sort of reminds me of THE NEGOTIATOR, only this movie mostly takes place outdoors. Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) was a dogged U.S. Marshals in my opinion. This is because he wouldn't stop chasing Mark.

As you know, this film as Wesley Snipes being chased, but we really don't  focus on him. His character was not defined, we never care for him. This film focuses more on Tommy Lee Jones' character, we don't hate him as much this time around. The female lead played by Irene Jacob was a medicore character offered nothing much, poorly written.The screenplay is the main problem, it takes too much from 'The Fugitive' and lacks character definition. The plot features many problems, one is extremely annoying - One minute, Wesley Snipes has a neck brace, the next, he's running around freely.The performances are good, quite enjoyed Robert Downey's work here. Tommy Lee Jones is very good, but maybe too likeable. Wesley Snipes lacked character in this, a disappointment. Irene Jacobs really didn't have much screen-time, a very talented actress.Stuart Baird's direction is very good when it comes to the action!

I really did not think that this movie was going to be any good. I simply wasn't interested, so I avoided it, for years. Until one night, when I saw it on television, and it seemed wholly different than I thought it would be. I didn't get to finish the movie, so I went and bought it at the video warehouse one Saturday. I watched and from the first scene I remembered, what it was from t.v. it was superbly made.Samuel Gerard, (Jones)has been alerted about a new case. He and his crew are back on line, chasing a different 'Fugitive'. Tommy, for me the first time I remember him, was in JFK. He played the old perverted business man, Clay Shaw, who was also Clay Bertrand. No matter how you can slice him, he always ends up even! Tommy Lee Jones is a believable, authority figure, who seems fair and very balanced. Until he plays a maniac, or something else then he is exactly that, who ever he is put into. I truly enjoyed Wesley Snipes in this tail of 'trailing'. I'm not really too much a Snipes 'Fan' just a hand full of things he has done that I liked, however, he was the perfectly 'pitched' guy for 'U.S Marshals'. With Daniel Roebuck and Joe Pantoliano, on the crew with him, plus Noah Newman,(Tom Wood)who is a great 'Posse' member with Gerard. The funny thing is, I can hardly stand anything that Robert Downy Jr. does. From all the trouble he is constantly into, and the drugs etc. But for this role, he was fantastic, in it. I wouldn't see anyone (too many other actors) doing this character what it needed, quite like Special Agent 'Royce' turned out! The director, did a righteous job of putting these characters in perfect order and exacting development of them. The high-line action that took place was quite a rush! I enjoyed the energy that the whole cast gave off as they tracked Mark (Snipes) through the 'jungle' of the city. He gave chase and the Marshals followed, in heated pursuit! The film was a thing of beauty that seems for new film makers, that it is becoming harder and harder to bring out a solid hit, that will stand the test of years to come. I didn't like that we lost the 'kid' (Tom Wood's character) Noah, in the shoot-out toward the end. I still had to give it a ten though. Even though I thought that Noah Newman, should have been there celebrating with his team. But all-in-all Baird, (the director) made a good choice in the way it all ended. I don't want to blow it for anyone, not that I think that should deter anyone from enjoying outstanding performances from all, thank you Stuart Baird as well! But through and through, this was a real tough show-stopping action extravaganza! Barnone.I recommend this to all Tommy Lee Jones, or Wesley Snipes fans and to others looking for an intriguing story. Even if you just like him, you'll probably love this!

So the sequel instead tells the story of the US Marshals who were chasing Kimble in The Fugitive, lead by Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Instead of chasing Harrison Ford, Jones chases Wesley Snipes in this movie. Snipes plays Mark Sheridan, a man who may or may not have been framed in his crime. Sheridan is able to escape a prisoner transport air plane when it crashes somewhere in the swamps of Louisianna, and thus begins the chase. This movie is not just a standard chase movie, there are political undertones as a rivalry develops between the Marshals and local authorities and the FBI. The chase movie is interesting until the movie veers into the realm of United Nations politics, then it kind of lost me. The other problem I had with this movie is that I ended up rooting for the Marshals more than the fugitive. If that was the goal of the movie, then it accomplished its mission. However, the fun with the original Fugitive was that a Hichtcockian man, falsely accused, was able to outrun the authorities and clear his name. We rooted for Dr. Kimble. Here, we root for the police, which I did not find as interesting. Though, I will say, the movie opens with one of the funniest scenes involving Tommy Lee Jones and a chicken suit.

The premise of bigger, better and more of the same does not make a a good sequel. The whole enjoyment of the Fugitive was the sense of desperation the audience shared with Harrison Ford as the innocent hunted man. Never do you feel sorry for snipes as he is pursued by Jones and co. For an actor of Snipes calibre it's strange how the desperation and intensity of his plight are not portrayed.The main problem with US Marshals is with Tommy Lee Jones. His character was portrayed in the Fugitive as a self obsessive one man army who will not stop till his man is caught, for which Jones deservedly won an oscar. In US Marshals his character is diluted probably to make him seem more of a good guy which just seems like a cop out. The ruthlessness portrayed by Jones in the Fugitive seems to be missing and his character as a result loses his edge. For example Jones in his opening scene is wearing a giant bird suit. This is such a laughable attempt to make the audience warm to a character who although unintended was seen as the bad guy throughout the fugitive.The original Fugitive was a dynamic battle of wills between two headstrong characters one driven by desperation the other by his intense internal drive. The head to head between Jones and Snipes is lost by the sudden inclusion of Jones misfit team and Robert Downey Jnr. Jones is no longer seen as a possessed single minded man but as a leader of a team which misses the point of the film which is a head to head pursuit.Overall with the characterisation lost US Marshals just degenerates into a by the book action thriller with the action scenes lacking in excitement as the audience just doesn't feel anything for the characters like in the original Fugitive. No matter how elaborative an action sequence maybe if you don't feel for the characters they lose impact. US Marshals is a waste of time money and talent.

If you look at US Marshals as an independent, separate film, it isn't bad.  That is due much to Tommy Lee Jones' repeat command performance as Sam Gerard.  Jones' charisma is alone enough to save almost any movie.  (Interestingly enough, I've heard he's never taken an acting class.) The hero in disguise, in other words, our Fugitive, is not the unforgettable Harrison Ford but a secretive ex-intelligence officer (Wesley Snipes.) Unfortunately, we are not given as much insight into Snipes' character as we were with Ford's in the first film.  We felt sympathetic to Ford's Fugitive because we identified with his confusion and sense of morality; Snipes' running man is too unfamiliar and undefined and we don't seem to care for him as much.  This is due, I think, to the script and not to Snipes' performance. The movie also lacked the tight dialogue of the first movie.  But again, we should perhaps view this as a separate film altogether!  The one really BIG stunt involving a swinging something or other and the top of a moving train wasn't as believable as the equally implausible dive off the dam in the original.

As a sequel, it's almost a remake, like was the case with the first two Terminator films; only a few things are changed, to make it seem like a new film. The fugitive in this film also claims to be innocent, and much of the film is similar to the first. The stakes are a tad higher, and there may be a bit more action that in the first. Apart from that, it's virtually the same film, albeit with worse direction. The plot is pretty good, the way it develops works well. The pacing is fairly good, at least early on. The acting is pretty good, with both Pantoliano and Jones again giving good performances, both returning to their respective roles from the first film. Neither are as funny as they were in the first, though. Wesley Snipes is a good choice for the new fugitive. The characters are well-written and credible. The action is pretty good and quite intense, but I think there may be too little of it... I found my mind drifting for most of the time I saw it, and it never really grabbed me the way it seems like it should have. Decent enough film, just not something worth going out of your way to see.

The guys were a big part of a very well-made, highly successful movie, they could easily be placed in any number of exciting situations. They had great camaraderie and it was fun to watch them do their thing the first time around, so why not bring 'em back? But, here's the thing with this movie, and this is something that studios in Hollywood predominately don't care about; if the script is thoroughly nothing special, there is not much the actors or the budget or the special effects can do to redeem the venture. This was a classic example of a sequel that was guaranteed to make money right off the bat, so the quality was a secondary consideration. It would also appear as though the screenwriters did as much sampling from The Fugitive (1993) as possible, from the innocent main fugitive, to the big crash on a prison transfer, to the out-in-the-s**t instigation of a hard-target search by the Gerard, to the thorough lack of possible villains among the characters, and so forth. None of this lead anywhere particularly interesting though, and after it was done, I felt like popping in The Fugitive for the fiftieth time. However, nothing since the initial viewing has ever made me want to see this movie again. Just don't waste your time, because U.S. Marshals does not have it where it counts.

Plus, it had that killer train-wreck scene!  Well, when 1998 rolled around and Ford wouldn't sign on, the makers of The Fugitive made this half-baked `spin-off' without him.  Still, Jones' presence in the first film is validation enough to carry on without Ford, as far as I'm concerned (he did win an Oscar for that role).Sheridan, a nice-enough government `kite' assassin, played by the over-rated Wesley Snipes (apparently for the sole purpose of attracting a black audience), is on the run while trying to discover who set him up concerning two covert Secret Service murders in NYC &#150; he was picked-up by chance in a tow-truck accident and linked to the crime.  He's quickly arrested and extradited to New York (on the same plane as Marshall Gerard), but the transport plane crashes and plunges into the Ohio River, killing many of the prisoners aboard.  And guess what &#150; Sheridan escapes, and the chase begins again as Gerard barks out, `We got a fugitive!'Gerard and his team are joined by a cocky government agent named John Royce (Robert Downey, Jr.) -- the low-point of the film -- and together they unveil a Chinese spy-ring that involves the US government and the United Nations.  There's a lot of cinematic hooplah, and some pretty unnecessary filler, but there are some great scenes as well.  How about the opening sequence, where Jones is disguised as a fast-food chicken to chaperon a stake-out, or the shoot-out in the old-folks home?  US Marshals certainly isn't on par with The Fugitive, but it's worth a look-see if you need a lil' action.  "},{"Title":"Boring clone of The Fugitive.

Gone is the compelling characterization and acting that made The Fugitive great. Tommy Lee Jones is still Sam Gerrard, the hard as nails, always-gets-his-man federal agent he was before, but with a few scenes that made a weak attempt to humanize the character. While these scenes were not disastrous, they took away from the invincible mystique of Gerrard and left me wondering, did we really need that scene at all?. They seemed very out of place and almost tacked-on.As for the fugitive in this movie, Wesley Snipes is a government super agent that is wrongfully accused of a double murder and taken into custody. He escapes and vows to find the man that set him up so he can be righteous again. A similar story but without much direction for most of the film. We don't have the mysterious one armed man to look for, in fact for most of the film we have no idea what Snipes' character is actually doing. It's hard to root for the man on the run when the audience doesn't know if he did it or not. Certainly the movie tries to portray Snipes as a sympathetic character, a loving girlfriend, he doesn't kill anyone while fleeing from the law, but it is very unconvincing as we are led from seemingly pointless chase scene to chase scene.Near the end of the film the plot does finally come together, sort of, but when we find out who the real villain is there isn't enough time left to develop him at all and after it is all said and done, one line of dialogue is all we get to explain his actions. I couldn't help but wonder, where was the righteous monologue from traitor to hero rationalizing his actions? Alas all we get is an, I did it, and a gunshot. A film fallen far from its inspiration into mediocrity.

However an attempt is made on Marks life on the plane which forces it to crash land, Mark manages to escape in the confusion. Also on board was senior deputy US marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) who flies his team in & gets the manhunt for Mark underway, as Gerard hunts Mark he realises that something doesn't add up & that there's more to the situation than just an escaped fugitive...Directed by Stuart Baird this was a sequel to the smash hit film The Fugitive (1993) with Tommy Lee Jones reprising his role as US marshal Samuel Gerard on yet another big manhunt for an escaped convict that turns out to be an innocent man on the run trying to uncover those responsible for his wrong imprisonment so in that respect US Marshals is very similar to the original. The script by John Pogue is a bit too long & rather convoluted for my liking. The story is a bit of a mess as it deals with various things like conspiracies, selling Government secrets, people being set-up, cover ups & some predictable twists, the story never really flows as well as one would hope with little bits of information given every so often which never really come together that well. I never sat there & after a plot twist was surprised or never thought to myself that makes logical sense. The bitty storyline just isn't as clear, forward moving or purposeful as it should be, one good example of this is the revelation of what happened in the parking lot when Mark was supposed to have killed two agents as the entire scene is played out on various grainy black and white security cameras with a running commentary from Gerard & it's just a very confused scene as it's hard to make out who is who & what exactly is going on. The character's are alright but nothing special, there's your typical obnoxious high ranking Government officials, there's the good old fashion hero, the anti-hero & the annoying comedy relief.Director Baird does OK but for an action thriller I thought there was a major lack of action, OK there's an impressive plane crash, a couple of shoot-outs & a few fights & chase scenes but nothing I would call particularly memorable or original. I definitely expected more action & a better story. It's also a very long film, at well over two hours you could find your patience wearing very thin by the time the end credits start to roll. The violence is minimal as is the action.With a supposed budget of about $60,000,000 this was a well funded film & apart from the plane crash I can't really see where all that money went although apparently Tommy Lee Jones was paid $10,000,000 of it. The location filming in New York & Chicago was also probably pretty expensive. The acting is OK & Jones is good, Snipes is alright & Joe Pantoliano is just annoying.US Marshals isn't as good as The Fugitive in my opinion, to be honest I think it's a rather confused thriller that isn't thrilling & the lack of big scale action set-pieces is very disappointing. One good plane crash just isn't enough for over two hours worth of investment. It's alright & worth a watch if you can catch it on telly for free but it's nothing more than average as far as I'm concerned.

Whether it is being a thoroughly unlikeable baddie or a determined good guy or somewhere in between, few can hold an audience's attention better than Mr Jones. Arguably his greatest moment came in the big-screen adaptation of The Fugitive where he rips the star from Harrison Ford so successfully that this belated sequel turned a few years later. And it is belated - not much you can really do with the character, besides what we've already seen.Jones is back as the stubbornly persistent U.S. Marshal (one L) Samuel Gerard, this time on the trail of a suspected murderer and professional threat to National Security Mark Warren (Wesley Snipes). Due to the political ramifications attached to the case, the FBI send along Special Agent John Royce (Robert Downey Jr) to assist Gerard and his team. But as they dig deeper and get closer to their man, it turns out that they are not being given the full picture - a decision which puts all their lives at risk.Given the strength of the three leads (plus the under-rated Joe Pantoliano in the background), this movie is better than it has any right to be. The story is predictably convoluted but you still quickly figure out what's happening, if not the why. Jones is excellent as Gerard but this is down to the writing as Gerard is a good character. Sadly, he isn't as good as he was in The Fugitive because he seems to have evolved into an ageing version of Fox Mulder, dealing with murky political cover-ups and corruption. How imaginative. Snipes is OK as the runaway, despite some appalling disguises that even Val Kilmer's The Saint couldn't pull off. Downey Jr has that rehab look, the same one he has in Gothika, that gives him an impression of turning up and saying the lines - anything more is too much like hard work. The tone of the movie is a little vacant as well - what little light-hearted relief there is falls flat on its face while the action is rarely better than competent.The film is a parody of itself. When Gerard is not about, nobody knows what the Hell they're doing and when he comes back, all is right with the world again! He may as well be omnipotent! And all the time, it suffers because you can't help but compare it to the much superior The Fugitive. You're not interested in Snipes' character or his possible innocence whereas the first film had a much more emotional hook with the story. This is an action-thriller by numbers, a wasted opportunity when there wasn't really much of one in the first place. Gerard was good but not enough to sustain a whole picture by himself. Throw-in a couple of ridiculous set-pieces (the initial escape from the plane is clearly evoking memories of Ford's spectacular leap from the train crash) and you're left with a distinctly average film that most pop-corn munchers will have forgotten by the time they left the cinema. Now that I think about it, that's three average action films that Tommy's been in (the first film I reviewed being Steven Seagal's Under Siege and the woeful disaster film Volcano).

Rather than cracking some jokes and smiles here and there, Jones goes around frowning and barely talking during most of this film. Here the action scenes are overly intense and are not broken up by any of Jones' jokes or wisecracks. In addition, there is nothing interesting about this plot that sets it apart from all other action/suspense films of its types. In The Fugitive, we had a man falsely accused of murder who had to prove his innocence. Here, we have a man (Wesley Snipes) who truly is a criminal just trying to escape from the law. There is nothing interesting or fun to watch about that. This is just a plain film which, with its Fugitive connections, does not do the previous film justice. Jones manages to make a few wisecracks in a couple scenes, but those jokes would not (and did not) win him another Oscar. Without spoiling, one character from the original film is killed off here, and it will be hard going back to watching the original now, knowing that character will die. The Fugitive is still my favorite, but nevertheless, do yourself a favor. Fugitve fans should avoid this film at all costs.** out of **** "},{"Title":"Imitation.","Date":"13 February 2007","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Spoilers.Let's see. A prisoner (Wesley Snipes), who has been framed and is really innocent, is being transported by airplane, shackled to his seat, along with a dozen or so other men headed for the slams. An attempted escape leads to decompression and a fantastic wreck, after which Snipes escapes. The local sheriff doesn't know what he's doing, so the ranking U. S. Marshall (Tommy Lee Jones) takes over. Jones is joined by his team, including the always interesting Joe Pantoliano. They pursue Snipes across several states, as he dons disguises and tries to track down the evildoers who framed him. (He's actually a secret government agent, and an ex-Marine, ex-Green Beret, and the usual others.) After many an exciting action scene, murders, hair-breadth escapes, fist fights in grain bins, the climactic exchange of bullets follows the revelation of the real bad guy -- Robert Downey Jr., who has so far been little more than a hindrance in the pursuit, apparently in the movie only to provide a little edge to Jones' leadership role.So far, it's about as close as you can get to The Fugitive without its being a remake. But the simple dynamics of the original plot -- an expert and determined tracker of good faith doing his best to capture a man who has been convicted of murder -- is here complicated by skulduggery in bureaucratic officials. And there was something appealing about the original idea two good men at odds. We wanted both to succeed, which seemed impossible. Here, there is a villain external to that dual relationship. The Chinese, whose consulate harbors a spy and a murderer. Kind of cheap. This movie hands us a villain on a platter, while The Fugitive flourished on its ambiguity.There are other differences, few of them improvements. The protagonist of The Fugitive was Harrison Ford. He was the guy we chiefly identified with. He was always in danger of exposure as we followed him from location to location. We don't get to know Wesley Snipes that well. The story sticks mostly with Jones and his team of Marshalls, which, considering the importance of the bottom line, is understandable because, after all, Jones' role won awards.Snipes is given a girl friend in this one, a white woman too, the staggeringly attractive Irene Jacob of whom more should have been seen in my opinion. Especially the scene in the Sax Fifth Avenue dressing room. It's rather nice to think that our attitude towards inter-racial affairs has been relaxed enough to show Snipes and Jacob embracing and kissing, though I doubt African-American women will find it too appealing.As an action movie it's okay. It has all the elements of a routine thriller and doesn't blow any opportunities, partly because there are so few opportunities to be blown. But it was prompted by the success of The Fugitive and I am beginning to wonder. Where are the original scripts that don't rip off successful models? The ones that initiate a trend, not imitate one.

The screenplay tries hard to be as smart as its predecessor, but never does gel near as well as the original's.  Snipes is adequate, but we never feel sympathy for him the way we did for Harrison Ford.  Robert Downey, Jr. is also all right, but the film would have been about the same without him.  The direction wants to make a worthy sequel, but becomes trivial by going for thrills and spills instead of using intelligence.  Tommy Lee Jones is impressive, but in the end he cannot carry the film by himself.  Somewhat disappointing.  2.5 out of 5 stars.   "},{"Title":"Here lies proof that Tommy Lee Jones' character didn't completely make The Fugitive what it is today. This film lacks a good script, a good good guy, and a good sense of direction.","Date":"19 September 2003","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  There was a certain intensity and solidness in 1993's The Fugitive that made it just about the most memorable chase film of all time -- and U.S. Marshals is missing that raw intensity. It's too slow-moving in the beginning, and when it does pick up speed it seems dreary and pretty corny, actually. Not to say it's a bad film -- The Hunted and such films were much worse -- but in light of how excellent the first film was, this one deals a major blow.Tommy Lee Jones is back as Marshal Sam Gerard. Dressed in a chicken suit he raids the apartment of a criminal and gets on a plane to transport him and the baddie to Missouri. There's another man on that plane named Mark (Wesley Snipes), who has been accused of a crime he hasn't committed. A convict tries to assassinate Mark onboard, causing the plane to go through some unfortunate motions and crash in a swamp land. Mark escapes from the authorities, however, and flees into the swamp lands. Jones begins the chase to hunt his felon down. We've got a fugitive, he barks, probably posing for the TV ads.Robert Downey, Jr. joins the chase along with Cosmo (Joe Pantoliano) and Gerard's old team. This film centers more on Gerard's Marshals than the criminal chase element, which is probably why it's called U.S. Marshals and not The Fugitive II. The whole Wesley Snipes scenario serves to be a silly excuse to see Sam running about with his team.They chase, jump, fight, chase, leap on a train, chase some more, fight some more, kill, kill a bit more, and so on and so forth. The Fugitive was a chase film, a thriller, a mystery, an intense character study between two men who find they may have more in common than they think. Harrison Ford's Richard Kimble was a man we could sympathize with just as much as Tommy Lee Jones' Sam Gerard -- a key element to the film. It showed us both sides of the chase. This is just a routine chase film for the most part -- with the occasional breathtaking stunt -- but they're not nearly as breathtaking as those in the predecessor.The movie kills off a considerably important main character during its course, something you aren't really expecting. Yes, it was a pretty big surprise, given the fact that it is someone from the first film who you aren't expecting to get killed off -- but when it happened it felt more like a cheap surprise -- one made by the director as to wow us and make us take the film more seriously. I call this a cheap thrill.And the final problem I will address is Wesley Snipes' convicted good guy. We're supposed to believe he's a good guy, to genuinely root for him, but his character is not nearly as empathizable as he should be. Harrison Ford created a man we truly cared for -- a man who had really gotten the raw end of the deal. He threatened to harm people a few times but never harmed anyone. In fact, he even saved a little boy in a hospital while being chased after by the cops. Wesley Snipes' character Mark is a selfish character who will do anything to survive -- even if it means holding a knife to a woman's throat and telling her husband to drive him across a bridge and lie to police troopers, or even if he were to fire a gun at the U.S. Marshals on his tail. Sam later says, If he wanted to kill me, he wouldn't have aimed for my chest protector. It doesn't matter -- he still shot the guy and nearly shot another Marshal so he could escape. It made me wonder what Harrison Ford's character would have done given the circumstance. But then again, Richard Kimble wouldn't have been stupid enough to flee into deep marsh land where he could be easily trapped, either. "}]
