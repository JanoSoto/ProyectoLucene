[{"Title":"falls short of its potential","Date":"27 April 2002","Score":"33 out of 36 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  `Life, or Something Like It' is a romantic comedy with a better-than-average premise.  It attempts to address the question `if you suddenly discovered that you might only have a week more to live, how would you spend that remaining time and what changes would you make to your life?'  Perhaps because this IS a romantic comedy, the best the film can manage to do within the tight strictures of the format is to raise a few of the more provocative issues surrounding the theme &#150; those dealing with the meaning of life and the vagaries of fate, for example &#150; then drop them so it can address itself to the customary clichés one would expect to find in a film of this genre.  One only wonders how a more serious-minded European filmmaker, for instance, might have tackled the same subject matter.Angelina Jolie plays a beautiful, but thoroughly superficial and self-absorbed TV news reporter living a near-perfect life in Seattle.  Indeed, when we first meet her, Lanie Kerigan seems to have everything going for her stunning good looks, a glamorous profession, a handsome major league ballplayer fiancé, and now a major career advancement in the form of a regular spot on a national morning news program.  One day, however, her world comes crashing in when she meets up with a homeless man on the street, a self-styled `prophet of God' who tells Lanie that she will die within a week.  When all his other predictions begin to come true, Lanie realizes that this man may not be quite the lunatic or charlatan all her friends and acquaintances keep assuring her he is. Given this setup, `Life, or Something Like It' can't help but grab our attention.  We wonder how we too would react if such a horrifying scenario were to suddenly present itself in our own lives. The problem is that the movie doesn't really do much with the material it has to work with.  Nothing Lanie does seems particularly thoughtful or meaningful when she is confronted with potentially imminent death indulging in some halfhearted attempts to reconcile herself with an estranged sister and father, giving up her health-obsessive diet and exercise regimen, and dumping the fiancé with whom she discovers she has nothing in common.  Considering the thematic potential of this material, the film always seems to be lagging several intellectual beats behind where it should be.  This is particularly true in the predictable love/hate relationship she shares with Pete, one of her cameraman coworkers.  Yet, oddly enough, it is this very pairing of Jolie with Edward Burns that gives the film its moments of greatest charm.  Both performers are so likeable in their understated warmth and vulnerability that we can't help liking and rooting for their two endearing characters.  Paradoxically, then, the film satisfies us most when it is at its least innovative.  The movie is at its worst in an embarrassingly unconvincing scene wherein a boozed-up Lanie, sans makeup and carefully groomed coiffure, leads a contingent of striking workers in a rendition of `Satisfaction' in the middle of a live TV interview.  Cloying moments like these merely serve to remind us that we are stranded in movie fantasy land when the film could, with a little more effort, have ascended to a much higher level.  (The film, incidentally, endorses a rather reactionary view of women in the workplace, arguing that a woman needs to consider whether achieving success in the corporate world is worth sacrificing a chance at achieving marital and familial happiness &#150; a quandary that never seems to be posed to male characters in movies).Despite the fact that it has moments of quality and charm, the film, ultimately, feels like a case of lost opportunity.  One finds oneself leaving the theatre in a state of frustrating ambivalence acknowledging that the film works on a level of superficial entertainment but knowing that, with a little more depth and insight, it could have amounted to so much more.

Dumb title if you ask me. Angelina Jolie as a blond? I don't think so. Ed Burns as the love interest? Sounds like a chick-flick or &#145;something like it.'  All this needed was Greg Kinnear and I think we'd have something like &#145;Someone Like You', right? Well not exactly. Although this movie was obviously aimed at the female crowd and used just about every chick-flick cliché under the sun, there was more here than I expected. I found this movie very predictable for the most part but the characters are so engaging  (especially Jolie's) that you find yourself getting wrapped up in them and the story that surrounds them. The thing that stood out for me where a couple of scenes that had the audience so quite you could have heard a pin drop. One was when Angelina Jolie's character asks her fiancé what it is between them that dictates they should be together. Utter silence. The theater, in anticipation of what lame answer is about to spew forth from her jock boyfriend, was silent. The other was when Angelina's character is interviewing Stockard Channing's. Again total silence from the crowd. Those two moments in the movie  made it worth while for me. The rest is just as you would expect. I didn't find any above caliber performances here, just the really good ones you'd expect from this cast. You wont see this one on Oscar night but I thought it was worth the ticket price and it didn't feel like a waste of time. That's my take. What's yours?

The story unfolds as she proceeds to live her rather hectic, self-absorbed life interspersed with romance, a somewhat strained relationship with her father and sister, and the ever-present wonderment as to whether Jack the Prophet will be correct in his prophecy that Lanie will in fact die in a week. In other words, the movie does manage to keep you on the hook right up to the very end. (The ending was a bit lame, but still had a good message if you care to adjust yourself to it.)Jolie's character, Lanie, is interesting, because if you watch the movie more than once, you will most likely start to be intrigued by her appearance the platinum blonde hair, the puffy lips, the expressive eyes, the makeup.... you might start to think she resembles Marilyn Monroe, or, you may just write her off as a woman who actually looks a bit like an attractive transvestite(!). But no matter, because whether you like Angelina Jolie or not, you can't help but be a bit intrigued by the appearance of her character, which is kind of out there for Jolie. One potential problem, though, is that she is possibly TOO out there, to the point where she may distract the viewer from seeing the message of the movieTony Shaloub's character, Jack the Prophet, is very well portrayed by Mr. Shaloub. He's lovably wacko, and plus he has some pretty funny lines in spite of his plight in life. I like the Ed Burns character, Pete, because he reflects reality, whereas Jolie's character is kind of too unreal, but still fun to watch.I liked the setting of the movie, Seattle, since I live in Seattle. For those of us who live in the rainy city, it's fun to see an interesting movie that takes place in our environs. They also used actual news people from a local Seattle TV station, so it was kind of fun to see people whom I've been seeing on the local nightly news actually appear in a Hollywood movie. They changed their real names, though, which was kind of weird.There were a few things I didn't like about the movie, the main one being that Lanie, who works as a modern-day TV reporter, comes across to me as just way too much of a sex-pot, I mean just way outside the realm of reality. It gets to be jarring after awhile to see such a sexy creature being passed off as a news reporter when we all KNOW that no modern local news station would put such a pouty, platinum-haired blonde on the air (....or WOULD they??? as Conan O'Brien would say.) But mainly I liked the movie, and it was actually worth a repeat viewing, as it kind of grows on you, and ultimately makes you THINK about your own life, your own values, your personal destiny, etc. BTW, there's a pretty good batch of songs that accompanied the movie too, though I don't believe there is an actual soundtrack available, so you will probably have to hunt down each song individually.All in all an interesting movie, with a message worth pondering - if you can get past the steady distraction of the appearance of Angelina Jolie, of course.Well, that's my review. You guys have been a great audience, thanks for listening!

If it fails to do that, perhaps a character that the audience would care about is in order. Life Or Something Like It fails to do both.Lanie Kerrigan (Angelina Jolie) is a local Seattle news reporter who is being considered for posh job in New York, for AM USA. She must first prove herself in the field by working with Pete, an experienced cameraman (Edward Burns) whom she supposedly hates. When the ambitious reporter interviews a homeless prophet, he announces that the blonde reporter will die within a week. Once all of his other predictions come true, Jolie's character begins to realize that she is in fact going to die. As Thursday (D-day) quickly approaches, the reporter re-evaluates her own life.The premise of the film is a little interesting at first. Sure, it has been done over and over again, but various interpretations have their own charm and there is room for more. However the development of the plot is just too obvious and there is nothing new, nor is anything portrayed in a very intriguing way.While Life was marketed as a light comedy, it is anything but. Comedy would have been a much better direction for the filmmakers, however aside from a few jokes on the sidelines, the film takes itself very seriously. The tone of the script is confused. It's similar to A Knight's Tale which also tried to hopelessly shift between drama and comic relief. In the end, we end up with a picture that doesn't work as a drama or a comedy. Throughout the film, it feels as though the filmmakers kept changing their minds.Unfortunately the confusion is not the only self-destructive component in the movie. The character development also does the job fairly well. Jolie shows Lanie's ambition sufficiently, but the movie suggests that there is more wrong with her life than a little healthy competition. It seems ridiculous that a person whose real tough faults we haven't seen is trying to change her ways. The movie seems to artificially pull Lanie into changing, instead of using character development as cause for such an evolution. Lanie changes at the end, but the question, why? remains. Pete's relationship with Lanie also seems forced. Pete flashes randomly throughout the movie, cueing Lanie's unfolding.Edward Burns carries his role well enough, but unfortunately there isn't much to carry. Angelina Jolie just doesn't seem to fit into this role and while she is a talented actress, there is something very odd about her in Life. In fact, Tony Shalhoub is the only actor who remotely stands out in this movie. Although his dialogue follows the same scripted fate as the others, Shalhoub manages to express with his voice and facial expression much more than the script actually inhibits.The script doesn't allow the audience to care much for any of the characters, doesn't contain a single original idea and tends to push ideas aggressively instead of allowing the audience to discover them. The script also leaves off various unresolved mysteries, most of which only seem to act as space fillers. The filmmakers take us towards one direction and back off immediately afterwards. Maybe they forgot? Considering the pacing, most of the audience did too.Life Or Something Like It is comparable to one scene where Lanie's soon to be ex-boyfriend, Cal, takes Lanie to a ballpark in the middle of the night to throw a few pitches after a heart-to-heart talk. Lanie expects Cal to have some words of wisdom for her, or at least charm - but doesn't catch anything except the ball. Life Or Something Like It won't change your life and it won't change your mood either.If you need to kill time, see the movie - But what if today is the last day of your life?Grade D "},{"Title":"If I were going to die Thursday...","Date":"30 April 2002","Score":"18 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I wouldn't watch this movie.I gotta start off by saying that I'm still not sure if Jolie's character was a brunette or a blonde naturally. All the young Jolie pictures show her blonde (I thought) but she's obviously not a natural blonde.Honestly, when I leave a movie that's supposed to make me re-evaluate my life and what it means to live (like American Beauty did) and the only thing I can think about is the hair color of the star I think the movie failed. Sure, it wasn't too hard to watch and it worked out well as a Saturday afternoon hang-out w/ the lady-friend flick, but w/ Jolie I was really hoping this movie would fulfill its promise and be the engaging, interesting, thought-provoking film that it could be. Instead we see very strong similarities to American Beauty w/ a little To Die For thrown in for good measure and a helpin' heapin' of a John Cusack film (doesn't really matter which)What really bugs me about this film though is that I really thought the cast was great. They were so believable (well, except for Jolie's hair, which really is a character in its own right) and their performances were so strong that as I look back on the film I really don't understand where it went wrong...maybe it tried to hard at the end, maybe all the logic fell apart just to bring about the thrilling climax, maybe it felt too much like a parody of tv news to also be the love story/life lesson that it also sought to be. Sure parodies can have morals and realistic love stories but this one doesn't.I wouldn't avoid this film, but I wouldn't seek it out either.

Jolie delivers another spirited performance, and she is an extremely beautiful woman with a smile to die for.  But the movie is just dull, dull, dull.  First of all, if the director wanted to make this a straight drama that's fine.  Just don't market it as a COMEDY!  If sentimental schmaltz with few or no laughs is your definition of comedy, then you're in for a treat.  The director is Stephen Herek, who also directed the dull, forgettable Eddie Murphy vehicle Holy Man.  Like that movie, Life... is horribly uneven, taking a serious turn way too early in the film and never recovering.  Despite extremely poor attempts, I'm pretty sure Herek intended this to be a comedy.  Herek just has no sense of timing!  And may I add, there are certain scenes in the previews that weren't used in the final cut--Why the hell do directors tease us like that?!!!!!!  For example, there's supposed to be one scene where Jolie is on the set of a TV show and a light from the ceiling falls down, inches away from killing her.  But there are no scenes where her life seems threatened.  Instead, the movie gets preachy and sentimental about the subject of carpe diem and developing the all-too-predictable love affair between Jolie and Edward Burns.  Like always, they start out hating each other's guts and about 20 minutes through the flick, they're practically soulmates.  The character arcs are so quick and stilted.    I like Edward Burns, but he should definitely stick to independent film.  I don't usually say this about directors, but he should stick to starring in his own movies.  His writing is obviously much more creative than that of Hollywood screenwriters, who get paid 10 times as much as him.  OK, he was fairly good in 15 Minutes and quite good in Saving Private Ryan, but he should try to steer clear of Hollywood.Every scene is so dull and downbeat.  Herek tries to redeem himself with pretentious fast-motion shots, identical to those of Madonna's Ray of Light video.  If Jolie weren't the star, this film would be dead in the water.  And Tony Shalhoub deserves better as well.  I'm not surprised to see him in a corny flick, but he is an underrated comic actor and I loved him on Wings.  Jolie decided she would take a break from movies after done with Tomb Raider.  Why, oh why, did she change her mind and star in this ultimately forgettable pseduo romantic comedy?  She should've saved the blonde hair for a much better movie.

It really isn't much different from all the other romantic comedies that come out. I enjoy the main actors - Jolie, Burns, and Shaloub - and each does a fine job with the roles they play.In the flashback intro we see that Lanie (Angelina Jolie) was a cute little girl but with thick frame glasses so the boys tended to ignore her. So she focused her energy into an ambition to rise to the top in broadcasting. She is one of several candidates for a NYC job, and a chance to move out of small-time Seattle TV.She is required to work with cameraman Pete (Ed Burns), an old boyfriend who still shows an interest. Together they encounter Prophet Jack (Tony Shaloub) who stands on a plastic milk crate on the busy sidewalk and makes proclamations. That day he predicted the score of a game, that it would hail the next morning, and that Lanie would die in 7 days.Lanie is shocked when the first prediction comes true, then further afraid when it is hailing the next morning. Not wanting the death prediction to come true, she tries hard to prove that not all Prophet Jack's predictions come true. But he says they do, he just hears the message and repeats it.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW. Lanie and Pete get close again, then he is devastated when she is picked for the NYC job and she just plans to leave him in Seattle. While there, and doing a very successful interview with popular journalist Deborah Connors (Stockard Channing), she comes to realize the folly of her selfish dream, and a little bit of her dies that day, 7 days after the prediction.

It was a movie with a lot of very good actors in it, particularly Angelina Jolie, Ed Burns, and Tony Shaloub. However, in the end, it wasn't as original as it could have been, and its message is far from unique. If I had a nickel for every time a movie used the hackneyed phrase, Live life to its fullest, I would probably never have to shell out my last ten dollars to see a movie at the movie theater again. For those reasons, the movie was really just okay to me; not great.Angelina Jolie stars as Lanie Kerrigan, a young ambitious TV reporter who is already well-recognized and credible in her local Seattle network affiliate. Her ambition is to be a reporter on the Today Show-like network morning news show AM USA. When she gets the opportunity to audition for the show, a street psychic (the great Tony Shaloub) prophesizes her death effective seven days from the day she asked.Admittedly, it is nice to see Jolie in a role that doesn't involve her being a tough-as-nails action hero or a sex kitten. Also, she had some good parts in this movie that were a bit heartfelt, such as when she reflects on her rebellious childhood, or reconnects with her blue-collar father. However, as good an actress as Jolie truly is, my guess is that she must not have done much research for her role. Why? Because she is completely unconvincing as a TV reporter. When asking questions (particularly in her last interview), she practically whispered her questions, which is something TV reporters (at least good ones) should not and do not do. Jolie probably should have studied Katie Couric or Meredith Viera, and she wouldn't even have to leave her trailer to do it either.Her romance with Ed Burns' character was also really hokey, not to mention predictable. He's a good looking guy, and they fight constantly in the beginning of the movie. Such a setup is so overdone (even dating as far back as Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing) and so unoriginal that I was not surprised at all when their romantic scene came up. It surprised me too, because Burns is not only one of the more likable lead actors in the history of romantic comedies, but he has also starred in, written, and directed some of the most original romantic comedies ever (The Brothers McMullan, She's The One). Burns is still likable in his role, but this romantic subplot is so cliché that it really ruins the film.The plot involving Jolie trying to deny or avoid death was also completely unbelievable, particularly towards the end. First, without ruining anything, Jolie's character realization of her fate in the very end seemed a bit contrived given her circumstances. Second, I didn't really get involved with her character enough to care if she died in the end. I guess the character wasn't developed enough, or the plot was too flimsy and archaic. I can't decide which.This movie was certainly not terrible, and it had its moments. For the most part, though, there were too many scenes in this movie that went beyond the laws of common sense that it was just too unbelievable. Other scenes, if not unbelievable, were just too predictable. If the movie had decided to just be a movie about a successful woman's pre-midlife crisis based on false prophecy, and not a romantic comedy in Deep Thoughts clothing, it probably would have gone on to more accolades. Instead, it's just marginally good. I can't give it a stronger recommendation than that.

When she interviews a street prophet (Tony Shaloub) who tells her she is going to die in a week, she starts wondering if her happiness is just an illusion. Even though the movie features a respectable cast with Angelina Jolie in the lead, the characters are somewhat dull. The plot is pretty basic and leads to a predictable but good moral. Jolie scores the worst haircut of her acting career and her performance is slightly out of tune. I guess you can't always be on top of your game. This movie is probably not the grand following Jolie was expecting hardly 3 years after winning the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for Girl, Interrupted. Despite those bad moves, the 40-million-dollar budget paid for a decent editing and nice cinematography. The sense of humor is alright and the rock-flirting-with-punk soundtrack makes the picture a bit spicier. I can still enjoy this film even if it's not a must-see. 1 reason to watch it the editing and cinematography are surprisingly nice 1 reason NOT to watch it the worst haircut of Jolie's acting career "},{"Title":"does your life have meaning?","Date":"7 January 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" It is not top notch but this film should definitely be given more credit. it tries to remind us, yes, yet again (but I think no matter how many reminders we get, we still don't get it,) that we should live our life as if each day was our last because one of them will eventually be the last nd also that we should hurry to say our dear ones that we love them indeed. Lanie is a woman representing the typical ugly duckling insecure type turned into a beautiful career shark. She lives with the illusion of a perfect life, with a seemingly perfect career and a perfect boyfriend until the prophet foretells her imminent death. she sets about to change the texture of her life, discovering how empty her life really was and rediscovering her true self, dropping the quest for self-approval which dominated her whole life.The actors did a great job. I didn't see Angelina Jolie in such a role before but I must say she handled it with talent. Her acting very much added to the emotional part of the story. Ed Burns did a nice job too, although I had the impression that by the time the movie ending he got slightly weary. also, the music choice was really great.Overall, the story balances between humour and drama, and while it does have its dose of typical elements, it presents the events technically very nicely. There is a sense of completeness to this thoughtful story. Plus it carries a meaning which cannot be stressed enough. Does your life have meaning?A very good job indeed!

Someone doesn't like Angelina Jolie? Well, she actually did a pretty good job in this movie, although I won't even comment on the blonde hair. Let's just say that brown is her look, that's all. As for the movie, the story is great. The story is amazing, a skeptical journalist, anchor woman gets a warning of some sort, a prophecy from a random homeless guy and then tries to prove him wrong for the whole week that's left for her to live. Those who plan to or already have made their careers the only thing they know will relate to this movie like no one else. I actually admire Lanie for both of the lives she lead the career woman and then a family gal with a career that, let's face it, much smaller than the one she would've gotten in New York, but still amazing. It pretty much took her a death to live through to throw out the highest peak of a journalist possible that she was offered in NY. And then again, it's impossible to live such a life without any regrets for all the things lost because of that career, and so she chose happiness over a dream. Kinda shows an example of when you really, really want something and then when you get it - it's not as sweet anymore. You realize that wasn't the thing that would make you happy at all. Ahh, that's why I absolutely love this movie and will continue on making my career my life, until something better comes along, and then to fully appreciate it I'll throw everything I ever dreamed of becoming away...and live every day, as if it were my last one. Gosh, if we only got to know the future. If only our plans turned out to become true without any heavy sacrifices.

It would have been at the top, made by a Claude Lellouch, Bertrand Tavernier, Patrice Leconte, or even Begnino Begnini (as a real comedy) Angelina is credible as an egocentric ambitious but hollow young lady. Her boyfriend, Cal, is up to the task. Pete could have been more convincing, but I give a high grade to the prophet.

Jolie and Burns are the proverbial opposites attract combination while obtaining and sustaining a good rhythm for the characters and the movie up until the scene between Jolie and Ms. Channing.  It is in this scene Ms. Channing does what  few actresses can do  in the time frame she does it in. She virtually changes the momentum of the film single handedly.  Her character is a Barbara Walters/Diane Sawyer type of interviewer that comes off as arrogant,controlling and in control person.  When Jolie's character interviews her at the beginning you see her as in control, then she turns in an instant vulnerable, and at the next turn motherly towards Jolie's character.  Then off camera at the end of the interview she is back to arrogant and controlling.  Her character makes a complete arc of transformation that is just amazing in and of itself .  But the amazing part is that Ms. Channing accomplishes that feat in less than ten minutes.  I doubt Ms. Channing will garner any award nods for being on the screen for less than ten minutes.

The heroine believes that her life is perfect as a local television personality until a street-wise prophet tells her she about to die. The prediction unnerves her and she feels the need to prove him delirious. Only when his further predictions prove sound does she start to evaluate her artificial existence. It is Jolie's performance that carries this film.  She shows range well beyond LORA CROFT and opens herself up to future, more demanding roles. In one scene, she resembles a voluptuous Marilyn Monroe, in another, she sings to the Rolling Stones Satisfaction. Edward Burns performs adequately as the TV crew cameraman and a previous lover, who assists the Jolie character through the emotional turmoil of facing her own death. Seasoned actor, Stockard Channing, as the widely respected senor newscaster, easily displays a strength and sensitivity forcing the protagonist into crisis. The sound track, with the exception of two tracks, could be stronger. Music can be very emotional and here it is not. It missed the uniqueness of a romantic comedy that films like SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE offered. Is it worth the price of the ticket?

Is the guy she felt in love with really the guy she wants to spend the rest of her life with and the one who makes her feel complete? Lanie realises that until then, pretending to be happy was more important to her than really being happy. She finds out that her boyfriend may be a great football player, but that he isn't the one she can have long conversations with about the things she deals with, that he's actually a very stupid and shallow guy although she thinks he's very famous and attractive.That's when she starts to change some things in her life.

The only problem I had with the film was the lack of an emotional connection between the two main characters. I'm not sure if this was because of on-set difficulties between the actors or whether it was intended by the director (in which case, that was poor judgment). Nevertheless, it was entertaining and comical - particularly the 'satisfaction' scene. That was original and very... satisfying.

I guess Hollywood thought that audiences would accept any romantic comedy that came along but thankfully this poorly conceived film bombed in the theaters. Story is about a local Seattle news reporter named Lanie Kerrigan (Angelina Jolie) who is hoping to get a job in New York City at a big network. While doing a story with a homeless man named Prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub) he states that the Seahawks will win their game, it will hail the next morning, and that next Thursday Lanie will die. The first two predictions come true so now she is convinced that she will die and starts to think about her own life and what she wants.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Lanie breaks up with her fiance Cal Cooper (Christian Kane) who is a professional ballplayer and she starts behaving differently and while doing a live story with picketing bus drivers she gets them to sing I Can't Get No Satisfaction. She also starts a romance with her camera man Pete (Edward Burns) who shows her the joys of the simple things in life but when she returns to work she discovers that she has the job in New York City and must leave immediately because her first job is to interview her role model Deborah Connors (Stockard Channing) and now she must think about if everything is worth it.This film is directed by Stephen Herek who is usually capable and his big critical success came with Mr. Holland's Opus but this film just lacks any type of freshness. Was there any question about what Jolie's character would do at the end? Burns comes across as some sort of perfect guy with his daddy routine and his simple philosophy about life. Both of them take time off from work like it was nothing and have no fear of losing there jobs, it must be nice! The story is also overly obvious in terms of the characters behavior and it does come across as a film you've seen before. If the hairstyle that Jolie wears in this film doesn't dissuade you from viewing this lightweight story then the script should. Jolie and Burns are both very talented but they both deserve a better film than this.

Still, it gets the job done, inasmuch as it is entertaining (to a point), has one interesting (though underused) character and will give die-hard Jolie fans, especially, something to revel in.  The problem is that the late night ruminations the filmmakers begin about the meaning of life end long before the store closes, and anything `meaningful' that may have come of it is left on the table for another time and another movie.  Suffice to say, this isn't Bergman; but then again, it wasn't meant to be.Lanie Kerigan (Jolie) is a field reporter for a local television station in Seattle, a `personality' of the affiliate's news team, covering human interest stories and events in and around the Emerald City.  She's engaged to Cal Cooper (Christian Kane), who plays ball for the Seattle Mariners, and all in all her life is nearly perfect.  And it will be `absolutely' perfect if she lands the job she's just learned she's up for  A spot on the network's prestigious morning show, which originates from New York and is broadcast nationally.  Yes, for Lanie, except for being teamed with an incorrigible (in her estimation) cameraman, Pete (Edward Burns), life is good.  With her very next assignment, however, all of that is going to change.His name is Jack (Tony Shalhoub); he's a homeless, self-professed `prophet' who lives in a makeshift cardboard box and is given to `visions' which enable him to predict such things as the score of the next Sea Hawks game, or if it is, in fact, going to hail in the morning, regardless of the weatherman's forecast.  He's a colorful character, just right for a `Lanie' segment; but even before the actual interview begins, Jack tells Lanie two things  1.) She's not going to get that job she so desperately wants, and 2.) come next Thursday (one week away) she is going to die.  And just like that Lanie's life isn't so perfect anymore.  She's about to take that long walk on a short pier...To whip up this repast for his audience, director Herek manages to crack the egg and get it in the skillet, but he forgot to turn on the burner, so it never cooks; it just kind of lays there in the pan.  It looks good, but how many people enjoy raw eggs?  The screenplay (by John Scott Shepherd and Dana Stevens) lacks originality to begin with, and Herek shows little imagination in his handling of the story and the characters, so it never really comes to life, despite the efforts of Jolie.  And from the information we're given, or even from what is implied about the relationship (past and present) between Lanie and Pete, the `romance'-- such as it is-- just doesn't fly, even within the parameters of `romantic comedy' (Is THAT what this is?).  The biggest problem with the film, though, is that it fails to connect you emotionally with any of the characters; these just aren't people you care enough about to make it involving or maintain interest.  Add to that the fact that, even though this is light fare, it simply lacks the credibility necessary to make it work.  In the end, the audience would have been better served had Herek thrown in a couple more `yokes.'The film suffers something of an identity crisis, and gets caught up in a dilemma of it's own making; just what is it trying to be?  A romantic comedy?  If so, it fails.  Or is it striving to be a satirical exploration of a question perhaps too profound for the genre in which Herek is apparently working?  In which case it also fails.  It would have been much better for all concerned had the focus been on the relationship between Lanie and Jack the prophet, as THIS is where the real interest of the story lies.  The myriad possibilities this afforded remained untapped, however, as the filmmakers opted for another route which, unfortunately, never made it to the Promised Land.As far as showcasing Jolie, it does; but that is not to say that it presents her in the best possible light, the fault of which lies entirely with the inherent nature of the character.  Lanie is just too career minded and self-absorbed to be a thoroughly engaging `personality,' and it dulls the sparkle of what could have been.  Even her `epiphany' is not enough to make her star shine in this role.  As Lanie, Jolie looks the part; she's beautiful, even alluring.  But with this particular character, she seems to lose that edge, that intensity, that sparks her usual charismatic screen presence, which is absent here, as well.  So even though this film is essentially a `showcase' for Jolie, it simply does not do her justice.As for Edward Burns, can he dance?  Because if they ever make `The Gene Kelly Story,' this is the guy.  It's the timbre of his voice, so reminiscent of Kelly's (but it CAN be grating after awhile).  Burns is a good actor, and he gives a solid performance here, but his character, Pete, even after his `personal' story comes to light, just isn't that interesting.The saving grace of the entire film is Tony Shalhoub's portrayal of Jack, a character that will capture your imagination.  The trouble is, you don't see enough of him, and it's a dreadful waste of a potentially great character and storyline; a dreadful waste of the magic that could have made `Life or Something Like It' a film to remember.  5/10.

She assumes that if she turns her life around, maybe that will alter fate and she will not die.Don't be fooled by this film's marketing. This isn't the fun-filled romp the ads claim it is. In reality, it's a heavy-handed drama that is pretending to be a light romantic comedy. It's a melodramatic journey in finding what's important to life. It does, however, occasionally switch back and forth between comedy and drama. But sadly, it doesn't work as a comedy or a drama. The comedy is old and tired, such as when Lanie's boyfriend refers to Prophet Jack's ability as `ESPN.' It was funny three years ago in Analyze This, but isn't here. As for the dramatic part, the movie is afraid to tackle any dark subjects. Just when the film starts to inch close to an interesting topic, it quickly backs out. Angelina Jolie is an extremely likable person. The world already knows what a wonderful actress she is (she won an Oscar for her role in Girl, Interrupted). Plus, she's the only one who made it out of the train wreck Tomb Raider unscathed. She has a wonderful presence in Life or Something Like It and adds likeability to the otherwise rotten character.Also mixed into the plot is Edward Burn (from 15 Minutes, She's the One). Burns plays the cameraman Pete. Pete and Lanie absolutely despise each other, which ultimately means that they are going to fall in love. This is when Life or Something Like It turns into a hackneyed romance, along with being a hackneyed comedy and a hackneyed drama. It runs into every cliché in the book. `I've loved you since the day I met you,' is the especially cringe-worthy line. Edward Burns looks completely bored here. He has a low-key charm, but it's getting harder to stomach him. He's played the same character in about four other movies. He needs to get his career pumped up soon or else people will be asking, `Edward who?'Angelina Jolie tries her hardest to save Life or Something Like It, but in the end her efforts are futile. The movie is trying to rely a message about life, but in between the inane dialogue, the flat characters, and the unfunny humor, the message gets muddled.--------4/10  "},{"Title":"Boring or something like it!","Date":"10 May 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I think this was a waste of time for both young and talented actors (Angelina Jolie and Edwards Burns, who I think will be a featured blockbuster action hero very soon, he's good elsewhere!).

Jolie plays Lanie in an understated, sincere manner that mitigates this cliched character. The film's opening is promising, and the first half hour had quieter, darker moments in this film that began to reassure me that Jolie did not sell out to play in a Hollywood romantic comedy where the guy not only gets the girl, but saves her.However, Lanie is quickly positioned almost exclusively in relation to men (she doesn't turn to her best female friend when she finds out she is going to die, but rather to a man she loathes). As the previews make clear, Lanie strives for perfection because she didn't know her father loved her (yawn), is made more artificial by her dim boyfriend, is obsessed with what Prophet Jack says and falls in love with a guy she supposedly loathes.This relationship attempts a Rock Hudson-Doris Day wit, but the writer and director were clearly more interested in domesticating Lanie then they were in creating a believable relationship. Lanie and this unwashed chicken-soup-for-the-soul wisdom spouting sensitive guy actually manages to crack into that hard-as-lacquered nails exterior to teach her how to really live life--and love.There are humorous moments in this film, and Jolie proves that she is an extremely talented and versatile actress.  However, this film also proves that she has sold out--she has traded in the rebellious Legs of _Foxfire_ , the opinionated Lisa of _Girl Interrupted, the sexy and smart Acid Burn of _Hackers_ and the unforgettably brave Gia for a role that could have been played by any of the one-dimensional  but oh-so-perky-and-quirky female actors in Hollywood--of course, if Sandra Bullock/Meg Ryan/etc. had been in this role the film would have been completely unwatchable.The only redeeming character and storyline in this mess is Tony Shalhoub as Prophet Jack who turns in such a subtle, brilliant performance that  lends the only intelligence, interest and darkness to this otherwise saccharine film.THIS IS A SPOILER COMMENTIf the film had ended fifteen minutes before it did (like _Kissing Jessica Stein_ needed to) it would have been a somewhat inspiring, clever film. But it doesn't.

The cinematography looks extremely professional and not thrown together like most films in this genre look, and the script is good for the most part. However there are a few scenes that seem like they are a little trite (But nowhere near as bad a Pearl Harbor). If you are having a bad week and need a break for 90 minutes,or if you are looking for a romantic comedy, this film is highly recommended.

Her relation with the baseball player, the relationship between the two sisters and their father, the story of the Edward Burns' character and his son...everything is so heavily underdeveloped. It's the reason why the movie makes a totally redundant- and also leaves an unsatisfying impression.And if this is a comedy than were is the humor? For a comedy this movie surely has an awful few laughs in it. Basically in essence the Tony Shalhoub character is the only one that shows comedy potential but his character gets hardly used in the movie. There aren't really any comical moments or situations in the movie, though the movie still has a good pleasant and light overall atmosphere.The cast and acting in the movie is good, so the movie is obviously a waste of the talent involved. Angelina Jolie shows how a great actress she is, even with platinum blond hair. Nevertheless it's a real shame that her character and the Edward Burns have no chemistry at all. Come to think of it, none of the characters in this movie really have any chemistry with each other. So it's a good cast, that was just wrongfully cast and put together in this movie.Not sure what the movie tries to achieve; if it wants to parody anything, or if it wants to bring over a message about morals and life (probably the latter one). Anyway, fact is that the movie simply does not work out due to some bad storytelling and development and the characters that share absolutely no chemistry.Stephen Herek has never been known as a brilliant director but he has always made some decent movies, such as 101 Dalmatians, The Three Musketeers and Mr. Holland's Opus. This movie is however an huge miss from him.Really can't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Pure rubbish.... don't watch even if you have nothing else in the world to do","Date":"26 July 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Can anyone believe how bad this movie is?

The only thing that made me decide to even try this film is that it had a reasonable cast  Angelina Jolie &#150; yes, she has had some sub-par films lately, but she does have the ability to act.  Edward Burns &#150; a mediocre actor and filmmaker but not hard on the eyes at least, and Tony Shalhoub &#150; a brilliant character actor.  What I didn't realize is that this Olympic podium of actors, (gold, silver & bronze &#150; get it?) would be ignorant or desperate enough to be in such a stupid film.  Jolie plays an ambitious and vaguely bubble-headed Seattle television reporter who, while taping a fluff piece with her nemesis of a camera man (Ed Burns) she is told by a homeless `prophet' (Shalhoub) that she has a week to live.  *Possible Spoiler Alert*Let the mayhem ensue.  Of course she at first goes through denial and skepticism, and then she goes through the obligatory `I don't care so I'm going to do the worst things ever to myself' which pretty much boils down to eating a pizza and wearing her glasses instead of contacts.  We are supposed to believe that she is deep because we find out that she wasn't always ultra-glamorous, and that now that she doesn't care what happens to her, she has now changed and cool because she walks around in a black Suicidal Tendencies t-shirt.  Along the way she realizes things about her life that should be changed (we should all be so lucky to be counseled by a fake homeless guy in order to sort out our lives) and breaks and mends various relationships in her life.  While we do learn the answer to a question that plagues us all, that Angelina Jolie should never have platinum blonde hair, I think the most disappointing thing about this film is that it had the potential to be decent and fell so short that it borders on offensive. --Shelly  "},{"Title":"OH, the hair, the hair...the horror.","Date":"10 June 2003","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This movie didn't quite flow.

I say this statement to the lifeless unimaginative writers who should have revived the movie's dialogue with more creative energy. Angelina Jolie plays a bumbling reporter who is informed by a bum prophet that she has one week to live. Jolie's character observes that the prophet is perfect with all his predictions then she becomes fearful of dying or something like that (at this point, I needed some strong coffee to wake me up or some other strong stimulant like it). Edward Burns co-stars as the sarcastic cameraman who clashes then romances our lady protagonist. As big as an Eddie fan that I am, the character he plays in this film is the same old stereotypical one he plays in his own directed films. Eddie! This type of character is great in your movies, but do not `overburn' it in other director's movies. I do have to say that what did satisfy me about `Life or Something Like It' was a funtastic and energetic scene where our delirious semi-stoned (or something like that) reporter is covering a bus strike story and ends up leading all the strikers in singing along to the Stones' classic ` I Can't Get No Satisfaction'.

All of the major plot twists are revealed and leave no surprises. The only thing not told is the ending, which is pretty predictable in itself. The opening scene tries to throw the viewer a curveball by showing Jolie on a gurney, apparently dying. Any intelligent viewer should know that she is not actually going to be killed off.Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider) is charming in this film, but cannot hold it up completely. It might come off as uplifting and inspirational to a younger or more impressionable viewer, but just comes off as contrived and silly to anyone who can see through it. Not to say that this movie is unwatchable. It's actually kind of fun, just not very smart. There were plenty of laughs and the characters are interesting enough to keep you (for the most part) interested. Edward Burns (Sidewalks of New York) and Tony Shalhoub (13 Ghosts) give solid performances, although Burns is beginning to look a little one-sided.Director Stephen Herek (Rock Star) keeps the film at a fairly brisk hour and forty minutes, but somehow it seems that there were plenty of scenes that could've been taken out and replaced with ones that would fill the plot holes. I suppose inconsistency could be expected from the writer of Joe Somebody (John Scott Shepherd), though. The viewer is supposed to suspend disbelief on this one and not take it too seriously. The message is the main point, but live life to the fullest isn't necessarily something that needs repeating.This one would serve as a good rental or a mindless and safe date movie. Other than that, don't expect a challenging or exceptional film here. Check out the trailer first. What you see is exactly what you'll get. Skip it if you've seen enough.

Granted, the basic plot - someone dealing with being given a few days to live - isn't exactly original. But in the capable hands of Angelina Jolie, it works quite well.Jolie doesn't do comedy very often. Her work tends to be either dramatic (Girl Interrupted), sensual (Original Sin) or comic book (Tomb Raider), but in this film she comes off as cute and funny while successfully delivering just the right amount of pathos considering her character spends most of the film believing she only has a few days to live.Tony Shaloub is a highlight as the prophet who gives her this dire prediction, but Ed Burns is a bit flat as the leading man -- almost as flat as Angelina Jolie's singing voice during a strange sequence involving strikers, policemen, and the Rolling Stones classic, Satisfaction! She's gorgeous and a terrific actress, but I don't know if she'll be giving Madonna a run for her money in the music department anytime soon!Life or Something Like It isn't a perfect film, and loses points for pulling too many punches. (A repeat of the spoiler warning as I have to discuss the ending next).I think the filmmakers made a mistake in getting Lainie to believe she'll survive a bit too early. Her on-air interview with the Barbara Walters-like character played by Stockard Channing is touching, but would have been powerful if she still believed that she would soon drop dead.And as far as the actual ending of the film goes, I'm unconvinced whether it's a good idea that Lainie actually survives. I wasn't surprised that a technicality allows Lainie to die but survive, thereby fulfilling the prophecy yet living happily ever after, but it might have been an even better ending for her to not survive.All that aside, I found Life or Something Like It to be a fun, Sunday-afternoon comedy, one that will probably have a long life on home video. Angelina Jolie is the prime reason for watching this film with a wonderful, sympathetic performance - though the blonde wig doesn't suit her!

On assignment, she interviews a man on the street (literally...he's homeless) named Frank, who predicts that the Seahawks will beat the Denver Broncos, and that it will hail on Tuesday morning.  When this has all happened, this causes a lot of concern for for Lanie, because he's also predicted that she will be dead by Thursday and that she won't get the job.This sends Lanie on a journey to find her niche in life, where she's been, what kind of difference has she made in the world, etc.  She even tries to make deals with Frank to find out more information about her untimely death.This is a very good movie.  I didn't really think it was going to be all that great until Frank opened his mouth and set the whole premise for the movie.  When he told Lanie that her number was up, it caught my attention and I found myself second-guessing her in everything she did, wondering if she (or anyone, for that matter) can change their fate, knowing what might (or might not) happen.  I even forgot that the movie started out with her on the operating table. I would have given this movie a 6 but I enjoyed it more than I thought--7 "},{"Title":"Oh,  so sad","Date":"31 May 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  It's so sad that Angelina Jolie would pick a movie like this--I know she wanted to do a comedy,  but this really wasn't the one.  While I appreciated some of the very sharp dialogue and Tony Shalhoub and Stockard Channing's excellent performances (as always),  the movie was just overly sugary.  But it is rather amusing to see the so-called bad girl of Hollywood play this very put-together,  high maintenance news correspondent.  I'll put it this way  if it's on cable and you have nothing to do (like I did when I saw it),  then watch it.  It's not too bad (but that blond hair is!).

It looked horrible.  It was just so distracting because it looked so fake.  Also her big lips are quite distracting.  They have to be due to plastic surgery.As for the plot to this film, it was OK but nothing especially good.  Jolie is a reporter with a baseball player for a boyfriend who seems to be really going places with her career. Then one day, she interviews a street psychic and he tells her she has a week to live and makes other predictions that come true.  So, she reevaluates her life once she is convinced the man can see the future and that she will die.  Of course, the ex-boyfriend comes back in the picture because she has to work with him again. And the ending is very predictable.  She relizes what she had with the ex and what she doesn't have with her current man.The movie doesn't have any cute, funny moments. And scenes are edited by the fading out style and then jumping to a different scene.  That always makes a movie seem like it is moving at a slow pace.FINAL VERDICT This is nothing worth going out to rent. The story is predictable and Jolie's wig is awful.

It was good and sweet and nice.  It was earth-shattering but the majority of movies out there aren't either.  In fact, the ONLY place where this movie didn't get 9 or 10 out of 10 was with the plot itself.  It just wasn't all that original, though it did take a different spin on an old idea.  And that works too.Angelina is lovely as ever and shows a different side of her that isn't kicking the crap out of someone.  I would actually watch the news; even war coverage if she were the reporter.  She's quite a lady.  All the other actors and actresses did very well, too.  Especially one of my favourites; Tony Shalhoub.  He's always a 'character'.  And by that I mean an interesting one and always fun to watch perform.  But, all in all, everyone did well on their parts and deserve mention in this work.Direction.  Very well done.  Nothing there I might have done differently... certainly not better so it was very well-crafted.  Transistions were smooth and brought out Lanie's progression in character at receiving her 'prediction'.  Bravo.The story and plot.  Nice and differently viewed, though like I said somewhat used in other ways before.  Just not entirely original, though unique.  I thought showing the perspective of Lanie, starting from 'the end' as it were, was quite tricky and pleasantly different.Great fun film!  8 out of 10. thank you "},{"Title":"A vacuous J-Lo romantic comedy, oddly starring Angelina Jolie.","Date":"13 December 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I can't believe i watched this movie.Between the awful, awful peroxide job done on Jolie's head, and the plink-a-plink thoughtful interlude piano music (See Also American Beauty), and the frequent, gratuitous montage sequences set to trendy college rock, I couldn't find any redeeming qualities.OK, maybe Tony Shalhoub does a pretty good manic street preacher.If this movie had starred J-Lo, as it should have, I would have been tipped off to it's vacuous, meaningless script and never watched it.

It was somewhat entertaining although I would not have cast Angelina Jolie in the part. Frances O'Connor would have been a much better choice. Angelina Jolie wasn't very convincing as a reporter and she did not play well off the main male lead. The pair were lacking of charisma together. Angelina Jolie plays much better off of females like in Gia, Foxfire,  or Girl Interupted. I really don't know why she keeps on starring in these boring romance movies like Original Sin, this movie and the next one to come. She has much more chemistry and intrigue on screen opposite females. If she is doing this to prove that she is an actor with greater range, she is ruining her career. She should definitely get a different agent. She used to have flare and personality and come alive on screen but, in this movie and tombraider she just seemed like a cliche of herself and more dead than lively. She should star in more indie movies and start a new image outside of the ugly side of Hollywood mainstream. There are a great deal of good Hollywood movies out there, why is she picking the bad movies?

This reasonably lightweight role called for almost anyone other than Jolie, who plays this ambitious but slightly fractured creature as if she were doing someone's life story, some real-life TV personality who came to a bad end. A Lifetime special, as it were. Only the character isn't written that deeply. It really called for a Cameron Diaz or, if done a decade or so earlier, Meg Ryan. Hell, even Demi Moore way back when. Jolie is so out there at times, she keeps drawing us out of the movie. We are expecting something more to happen than what actually transpires, which is really a lot of nothing. A psychic bum (the always-excellent Tony Shaloub with very wild hair and messy beard) tells Jolie's character she is going to die in a week. She reacts more or less accordingly, and at the end of the week she dies. More or less. See the movie for a very lame denouement. Jolie also sports a very odd appearance, with a bottle-blonde bouffant and what I would call old-lady attire. Someone else might call it business attire. But on Jolie, it just looks odd. Edward Burns is along for the ride as Jolie's love interest although sparks definitely do not fly between these two. You may want to watch it for the constant closeups of Jolie's sublimely beautiful face. At the same time, you will wonder why she took this role. Must have been a nice paycheck, or she liked the director. Or she owed somebody a favor.

Screenwriters have discovered this largely unmined territory and are exploring it. I'm thankful, because the very idea is self-referential and it comes with a requirement that some examination of referential layering occur. And that's happening, even in extremely lowbrow films like this we get the nub of an interesting idea.That nub is wrapped around the old faithful you have died and get a second chance, or you are going to die, or even you are transported to an alternative reality or future time to see what life could be or not be unless you change. Pretty old stuff that. What's new here is the introduction of TeeVee as the reflection of the wheel of fortune. Our focus (the hapless Jolie) is a TeeVee person. She gets her fate in stages from the TeeVee as if it were God. Or the type of god that the real film is something that reflects what is written.So the screenwriter, like so many, decided to put some intelligent notion in their pedestrian fast food script. Apparently no one else involved in the project knew. But this has one shot worthy of note.
