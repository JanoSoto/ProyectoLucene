That's a given. But there are some installments in Leatherface's interesting journey throughout the decades that are solid enjoyable movies on their own, such as the 2003 remake and this one. Here I feel like the campiness of TCM2 met the thrills of the original TCM in a healthy middle ground. There are some ridiculous one-liners, but they're placed fittingly unlike the second movie where the comedy felt forced and sloppy. The acting in the movie is above average too, with your standard now famous but previously in a crappy horror sequel actor to boot. The main reason this is better than its predecessor is because it actually has suspense; not a lot of it but it's there. The creepy moments somewhat resemble scenes from the original but none of it feels rehashed. There are characters you can root for, and Leatherface is actually (kind of) scary again. There's also a satisfying climax, fit with heavy metal and cheesy lines that belong in a Marlon Wayans movie. It's just a fun popcorn horror movie with some gore, a couple thrills, and a decent amount of laughs. All in all, a movie is meant to entertain, and for the most part, Texas Chainsaw Massacre III did exactly that. Worth a watch for hardcore slasher fans. "},{"Title":"Time for dinner!

Maybe that's why nearly everyone was let down by the film itself. Most people view Leatherface as an unwelcome addition to the legacy that is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. No, it's not as good as the original or the sequel, but what do you expect when Tobe Hooper's not on board? However, if you do not compare it to its predecessors, it stands alone as a fun flick. It's at least watchable (unlike the Matthew McConaughey remake). The only thing I really don't like about it is the lack of continuity. The David Schow script is great, it just leaves out some needed information. In essence, this is the first in a long line of remakes. The director, Jeff Burr, does succeed in creating tension. My heart still pounds every time when they stop to fix that flat tire. Those far-off squeaking sounds are unnerving. The cast does well also. No one has the energy of Bill Moseley (Chop Top from TCM 2), but he's a tough act to follow. What they do have is horror favorite Ken Foree. Foree is always great. I don't care whether he's in Dawn of the Dead or The Phantom of the Mall, he's great. And you must give credit to Viggo Mortensen. He's come a long way from b horror to star in the Lord of the Rings. When it comes down to it, TCM 3 is worthy of a bit more praise.

Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III is about a couple who are delivering a car to California, and are crossing Texas country. They stop at a gas station where a creepy set of brothers work, and they are back on the road again. When a tire goes out, they stop to try and fix it, but Leatherface emerges from the darkness with his trusty chainsaw. In a panic to save themselves, they speed off and end up later crashing into another man's car. After the accident, they are chased through the woods and taken to an old secluded farmhouse where more torture awaits. The family includes Viggo Mortensen, far before his Lord of the Rings fame, which is interesting to see him in his early movies. This movie doesn't skimp up on the gore, it is an all-out gorefest, much like Part II was, except I enjoyed this one a lot better. I rented it on DVD and watched the unrated version, and it was enough to make you think twice about eating anymore meat, it was pretty darn gory. Bottom line, this is one of the better sequels of the series, and a giant improvement from part 2. It had some suspenseful scenes that were well done and the acting wasn't bad.

I couldn't have cared less whether the supposed heroes of the movie lived or died. A more unlikable pair do you rarely run across. The guy was a sniveling idiot and the girl had even less personality. Kill 'em and kill 'em quick was the thought running through my head.Second, we've got the characters that make up Leatherface's new family. Who are these people and where did they come from? I would have thought that the Texas Rangers would have completely investigated the Sawyer family and discovered any relative who may have taken in Leatherface after the events of the first two movies. And, are we supposed to believe that the entire extended family is also made up of inbred cannibal serial killers? With a family as large as the one presented in these movies you would think that (even if just by chance) at least one member of the family would have some reservations about hacking up innocent strangers. I almost get the feeling that the makers of Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III would have us believe that everyone in Texas is a nutty, chainsaw-welding maniac.Finally, there's Leatherface. I'll just say that he's a sad imitation of the original. And I know this has nothing to do with the character of Leatherface, but what's that engraved chainsaw all about?

There's no cowering to others in the family, transvestite behavior, or silly screaming as in other versions. Also this one has a great chainsaw, plenty of great character actors doing what they do best, as great characters.The film would have been better had the squeamish producers left in the X-rated violent scenes as they were originally. Would have been top notch if the (hideously deformed) Leatherface unmasking had remained, a bit that was eventually used to a degree in the 2003 version.

No longer in the hands of the original creators, this was a new leap for the series. Unfortunately by this point times had changed for horror films and the MPAA was cracking down on the violence in them. This film was target and suffered greatly. It ended up different from the vision of writer David Schow and director Jeff Burr and the closest we've ever gotten to what they intended to make is an Un-rated version. This isn't saying much though since this version is only slightly longer than the R-rated one. Does this mean the film is no good? Not at all. In fact, this second sequel is in some ways better than part 2 and so far is the best of the sequels.Pros Nice work by the cast. Solid musical score, plus a cool Heavy Metal tune over the closing credits. Stunning photography. Briskly-paced. Some good chilling moments. Though closer in tone to the original, this film has some good twisted humor. Fair amount of blood and gore. Good job on the make-up and special effects. Nail-biting last few minutes.Cons Brings nothing new to the table. Lacks the raw terror of the original. Not much plot. Unnecessary set-up for another sequel.Final thoughts By the time this film came out the slasher genre had run out of steam, but this still managed to be a solid film and sequel. It's still no match for the original, but it's not a washout either.

His name is Junior, not Bubba like he was called in the first sequel & the third film in my opinion is better than the first sequel to the original 1974 horror film. Many may disagree, but I on the other hand found myself enjoying this one more, simply because it tried to take Leatherface back to his roots by making him big & scary & not some bozo who got shoved around like in the second which was really just a horror movie take on the THREE STOOGES & the film plays it straight, returning back to the dark, brooding vision original director Tobe Hooper had originally envisioned, amidst loads of black humour creating plenty of tension. My favourite moment is when Leatherface is working on an electronic device asking him what the image is before him, which shows a person, Leatherface spells food & the thing keeps telling him he's wrong, which soon starts to get under his skin. The film also features a dead armadillo on the side of the road, a crazy wanting to charge someone for taking their picture when they never asked him to. The snap shots of the corpses that have been found chopped up & desecrated, the fact that one of the family members worked at the slaughterhouse, hanging animal bones, the final Dinner scene with a captured heroine, the final chase between Leatherface & the heroine, the crazed hitchhiker who terrorizes the couple, all the things that occurred in the first.The family here is just as deadly, if not even more so, than the ones in the first film. These one lay out booby traps to catch their intended victims. In a way, this also hearkens back to the first in the sense that, in that film, original director Tobe Hooper had Leatherface butchering the characters as though they were human live stock, here Leatherface catches them in traps as if he & his family were hunters in search of food, only here the animals being caught are humans. The family also tends to be much cleaner than those of the first films family as well. There is no junk in the yard, they have power to their house (No generators used to keep the lights on here) they have an up to date stove & fridge, a clean kitchen & living room & they've even rigged up a contraption that causes a sledgehammer to release & smack their victims in the head. Another thing Chainsaw III does is answer the burning question many fans have had on their minds, why is it that the entire family is men? where did the women go? Here it implies that they maybe raping their female victims & then after the child is born & weaned, they kill them off, unless they share the same sadistic sensibilities as they do. Since Leatherface has an equally crazy little daughter, who has human bones littering her bedroom & plays with the bones of an small infant, using it as a doll. Borrowing an element or two from Chainsaw 2, the film features a blink & you'll miss her cameo appearance by CAROLINE WILLIAMS who plays a reporter near the beginning (She played the character of stretch in Chainsaw 2) the line uttered by Dreighton Sawyer The Saw Is Family is engraved in Leatherface's heavy duty chainsaw & of course the family keeps a long dead relative around (This time it's the grandfather character) even when it was just the R rated video cassette versions of the film that was available a few years back I still thought this was better than Part 2 (Don't get me wrong though I still loved the second film) New Line Cinema tried to make this come close to the original & in my eyes they created a good a sequel as they could at least as it regards to the original series. It returns the series back to the dark brooding tones & backwoods mayhem seen in the first. Obviously New Line, excited at the idea of owning a second horror character along with Freddy Kruger might bring them even more profits & decided to buy the rights back from Cannon Films. Unfortunately New Line's efforts to appease the MPAA caused their plan to blow up right in their face. Obviously not learning their lesson with the butchered A Nightmare On Elm Street 5 The Dream Child, New Line heavily cut the film & as a result, it not only flopped at the Box Office, but poor word of mouth, over a almost bloodless Texas Chainsaw film, killed off any chance of a possible revival of the Chainsaw series. The Chainsaw series yet again scores in the acting department, landing some really good talented actors for it's acting troupe. The actors here are able to make their characters even more interesting & the score by JIM MANZIE & PAT REGAN really helps ratchet up the tension & makes for a pretty cool horror movie soundtrack & R.A. MIHALIOFF stars as the hideous Leatherface & really makes the character a force to be reckoned with. Director Jeff Burr also does a great job creating tension through out the film & the acting is above par for this type of film, which features an early starring role by VIGGO MORTENSEN as one of the family members.

Gone is the strange obsession the first sequel had with misguidedly over-the-top supposed comedic 'heroes'; the focus in the third shifts back to our favourite deranged family, where it should always have rested.Aside from a sleepy and badly-lit midsection where our potential victims try to escape through the woods, the script does well to keep variety high and the viewer on their toes with some deliciously uneasy moments.The vibe projected on this one fits into that late 80's/early 90's period for horror films with lots of dark humour and cool ideas in the mix. It may have been chopped up by the studio from what it originally was, but it's still a really entertaining watch, and for me sits side by side with the original in terms of quality because both scripts have entirely different tones.

Its previous sequel fell down in many aspects in that it tried to mix comedy and horror at all the wrong moments, however this sequel seems to get it all right. It returns the setting to the isolated house in the woods, Leatherface is completely maniacal in a circus freak kind of way as in the original movie and he looks as ferocious and scary as I've ever seen him. The acting all in all is quite good especially from our heroine Kate Hodge, and Ken Foree of Dawn of the Dead fame puts in a memorable performance as the innocent hunter down on his luck. It was great to see Viggo Mortensen perform in such a psychotic, sick way and compare it to his more recent Hollywood successes. Overall I don't see why people had such a problem with this movie. It's the best of the sequels and although that's not saying much, it's far better than Movies like Hellraiser or Candyman that we're produced during the post slasher phase.

Hooper's 1974 film said and did everything that needed to be said and done (the documentary style,iconic villain, the creation of theslasher-film template, the unrelenting suspense, the post-Vietnam worldview, the subtle political underpinnings about consumerism, greed,and the decay of the nuclear family, etc....). That film is an unparalleled masterpiece, and even Hooper's own follow up really didn't hold a candle or need to exist(although it was crazy, offbeat, quality cult film making on its own terms)so a third entry would seem a complete waste of time.So why even pay part III any attention? My adoration for it relies solely because of the first half of the film, which is very well-done and far superior to the second half. For starters, the acting is fine across the board Kate Hodge and William Butler, as the film's yuppie protagonists, are natural and serviceable in their roles, nothing award-winning or show-stopping, but subtle and absorbing enough to not take viewers out of the film, like many of its lesser ilk (slasher films in this era typically had bottom-of-the-barrel talent).The cinematography is also imaginative and stylized (i.e. the entire gas station peepshow sequence is fantastically shot and executed; the angle of our heroine through the cracked mirror, the claustrophobic lighting, the POV's from the peephole). And note Kate Hodge's reactions during this scene she genuinely seems creeped out and uncomfortable, and her reactions of fear and confusion in the scenes that follow are equally convincing. It's an underrated performance, in a film with uniformly underrated performances.The film's pacing in this first half is also impressive- from the deceptively mundane car conversation that opens the film to the bizarre body pit sequence which was so absurd, awkward, yet somehow plausibly creepy, indeed, it bordered on parody, (but then, this film as a whole can be seen almost as a parody), to the armadillo murder scene, then the gas station sequence all these sequences are knowing winks to the first film, but because the film modernizes them, it benefits as it places the viewers in the now instead of the then (the original's documentary feel is one of the film's greatest strengths, but years later, it does give one the feeling of watching historical news/documentary footage of something that already occurred-again,part of the film's raw, unnerving power, to be sure). But this film is set in 1990, so a documentary approach just wouldn't work, not to mention it would be derivative, redundant, and just simply out-of-place. So it's a credit to Burr and cinematographer James L. Carter, who later proved himself a real talent with more mainstream gigs, that they remained faithful to the mood of the original while taking some new chances.And how about that truck-chase/changing the tire sequence? I LIVE for scenes like this and sadly, modern horror films just don't take us here anymore the ominous, yet minimalist soundtrack, slow-burn pacing, effective use of that lantern light, and again, Kate Hodge seems genuinely freaked out in this scene, you can really put yourself in her shoes, and the boyfriend's reaction of incredulity, anger and frustration...there is some commendable attempt at realism here, a truly tense and nerve-jangling scene. Also, dare I say that the atmosphere in this scene comes the closest out of any film in the series to matching the flashlight fight between Sally and Franklin in the original film? It's that uncomfortable mix of anxiety,frustration, and dread that Hooper created so well that I think is unfairly overlooked in this sequel.Okay, so that's the first half. The second half is simply not as effective. It becomes, like I mentioned earlier, almost a parody of the first film, with an uneven mix of horror and (attempted) black comedy. There are HINTS of wit and social commentary (the mocking by one of the chainsaw clan of the elitist California couple's underwear, Ken Foree's completely out-of-place military survivalist, and Leatherface's hilarious scene with the Speak and Spell that somehow manages to evoke sympathy from viewers), but these clever bits don't really SAY anything or add insight. The one saving grace that makes the second half worth sitting through however, is Kate Hodge's transformation from genteel yuppie to traumatized bad ass. A nice touch and homage to Sally in the original. But then comes the final shot, which is almost as if director Burr threw up his arms and said alright, time for the trendy 80's slasher movie ending....this ain't no art film after all. And of course it leaves room for yet another sequel. Shame, shame, Burr.And there you have it LEATHERFACE, the wildly uneven, sometimes ambitious, but always amusing, what should-have-been the final word on an already dying franchise, and more notably, sub-genre that would never quite be the same. As we all know, SCREAM followed 6 years later, and the slasher film became a cultural artifact only to be mocked, parodied, and post-modernized to a new generation of film goers, most of whom, ironically, weren't even alive when their genre forefathers were in their heyday. So in that context, we should be grateful for earnest little films like TCMIII, which, while far from perfect, mark the end of an innocent and forgotten era of irony-free slasher film making. Sigh.

The girl who spends most of her time trying to escape the family of crazed maniacs with her life ends up holding the chainsaw herself, swinging it around like a lunatic exactly like Leatherface did at the end of the original film, which led me to believe that it would suggest a general direction that the movies would take in any further sequels. Instead, Texas Chainsaw III, one of the more controversial entries in the series, seems to be unaware of its predecessors.I hesitate to condemn the entire film just because it is seriously lacking in the quality department, if only because I watched the 'Making Of' featurettes on the DVD and found that the cast and crew actually went through some serious trouble getting the thing made, and the cause of a lot of the drops in quality was some things that they had to cut or change in order to get an R rather than X rating. You would think that all they have to do is cut out excessive blood or guts or nudity to tame the rating a bit, but they had to completely change scenes in order for the blasted MPAA to allow them to release it. Wes Craven went through similar troubles in some of his earlier films, like Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes, and when you learn what they deal with it's not so hard to figure out why the MPAA is not popular with horror filmmakers.(spoilers)One thing that had to be changed, for example, was the ending. This is why you see a character show up grinning at the end of the film, despite the fact that we watched him get his head chainsawed in half earlier in the movie. Before you yank the DVD out of your DVD player and try to stick it in the wall, take a few minutes to watch the making of documentary, which essentially is 30 minutes of the cast and crew trying to explain why the movie was so bad. One verbose reviewer who calls himself Duke De Mondo writes a hilarious review in which he asserts that the Texas Chainsaw sequels all seem to pay homage to the original film as though it were some kind of urban legend, constantly reshuffling everything except Leatherface, the only character who is expected to be in any Texas Chainsaw movie. Hence, in part III, Leatherface is the only returning character, and as the director explains on the accompanying documentary, everyone else is some sort of surrogate family brought together my similar deviations from sanity. Still a pretty weak explanation for the little blonde girl, I should think.Speaking of which, it should be mentioned that at one point in the film, two people get chainsawed to death minutes apart, and it is not until I saw that little girl standing at the top of the stairs that I was even slightly apprehensive. What is it about little kids that makes them so scary? It's the worst when they are dressed in cute little outfits that just clash so strongly with their surroundings, like the little girl in this movie or, probably most famously, the twin girls in The Shining, who I still think are some of the creepiest kids ever captured on film. This girl turns out to be an aspiring member of the family, eager for her turn to put the meat hooks and sledge hammers to good use, and who decorates her room not with flowers or Barbie's or anything even remotely pink, but with human bones and skulls, presumably left over from the original Texas Chainsaw and, subsequently, The Hills Have Eyes. And this is to say nothing of her doll. You know, Jodie Foster had to undergo counseling in preparation for her role as a 12-year-old prostitute in Taxi Driver. I really wonder if there were similar concerns for this girl, whose film-making ordeal can't have been much less damaging.As far as the gore, Texas Chainsaw III is famous for being disappointing, but this is explained by the whole ratings fiasco. On the other hand, there was much talk about death scene of the girl who had already been running from the crazed family for five days or so when this movie started. Supposedly she was sawed in half from the stomach up, but this is simply not true, even in the unrated version that I watched. Yes, there is a vast quantity of blood in the scene, and yes, she does get brutally killed with the saw, but no, she does not get sawed in half and then her body peel off in two directions, having been split down the middle. It just doesn't happen. Nevertheless, I should think there is sufficient gore in the movie to satisfy all but the most depraved horror and Chainsaw fans, especially considering the sledge-hammer scene (which is based on a real police photo of Ed Gein's basement, and is one thing that the movie deserves at least some credit for), the above-mentioned chainsaw scene, and the scene where one character gets his head sawed almost in half at the ear level, although, as we later find out, does not kill him. If this is not enough for you, watch Day of the Dead. And if THAT is not enough for you, watch the news. There are plenty of videos coming from al Qaeda that are truly, truly disturbing.Viggo Mortensen, although he almost didn't get the part because his audition just didn't go very well, was outstanding as Tex, who is essentially the character that Matthew McConaughey plays in Texas Chainsaw 4, which is by leaps and bounds the worst of the series, including the 2003 remake (which I have not seen at the time of this writing, but it is physically impossible that it was worse than that ridiculous mess). There is one scene where Tex nails the heroine's hands to a wooden chair, and then casually asks her how she likes Texas. Pretty disturbing, but it doesn't make you want to slap your forehead, as McConaughey does from start to finish in part 4.Well, I'm sure she's having a blast, although the movie was filmed in California, incidentally about a 30-minute drive from where I live in Los Angeles. That's bike-riding distance for me. I was also impressed with the heroine in the movie, the obligatory girl who is the last to survive running from Leatherface (although this movie makes a slight variation on this trend at the end of the film). She manages to walk the fine line between sufficiently expressing her terror and not screaming mercilessly to the point where you just want her to get killed so she'll shut the hell up, and that is not an easy line to walk. I hope I'm not being misogynistic, but there is nothing worse in a horror film than the hysterical woman who simply screams and moans and won't respond when someone is trying to help her. I hate that. I have to admit that I was disappointed that the fancy new chainsaw, inscribed with the infamous quote 'The Saw is Family' and the most famous thing about this movie, was put to so little use. Not only is it not introduced until the majority of the killings are already done with another, much less shiny and interesting, chainsaw. And to make matters worse, not only is it underwater when it does its flesh-hacking (I guess the ability to run underwater was another of its special features), but the one character that it is allowed to sink its teeth into turns up not dead at the end of the film. Disappointing, true, but I have to say that Texas Chainsaw III is one of the better TCM films. Not as good as the original, but as good as the first sequel and light years better than the third sequel.

It's graphic, but it uses its gore and bloodshed almost as part of telling the story, as well as referencing the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre (through camera angles, props, and bits of dialogue) without going so far as to rip off that film. The music score was surprisingly effective, and did not distract from the movie itself.David Schow did a great job with this screenplay, for the most part, but film falls into the undying killer mode in its repetitive final third, where seemingly every character (Tex, Alfredo, Leatherface, Benny) returns from the dead for one last encore performance.Unfortunately, the theatrical version of the movie was seemingly edited with a chainsaw, and released in a horribly truncated version, missing several minutes of footage and rendering much of the plot incoherent.

Some people call it a reboot, but it is a sequel to the first film, it even has a recap of the what happened in the TCM, I don't know if that was just added in for continuity or if it was even in the original version. I like that the film followed the format of the first, it lacks the cheese and goofiness of TCM part 2. Even though the family is pretty sadistic, I couldn't help but laugh at what they said or how they acted with each other. The gas station attendant had some funny moments as well. The film is 1 hour and 24 minutes long, and was very entertaining, rarely a dull moment. The film is not as violent as part two was, it's mostly just blood splattering and and the odd severed head or face, we never see the chainsaw cut flesh, which is what everyone wants to see. Oh well, we have the newer films that aren't shy to show us what the title promises. Viggo Mortensen is in this film, it was neat to see his earlier work, I liked his line  Boy, they just keep getting dumber. Ken Foree is the character you end up rooting for. Leatherfaces final moment before the film ends, makes him out to be more inhuman then I once thought, then again this is the same guy who had a chainsaw rammed through him.You may ask why I gave this a 6 out of 10, well I don't think it's all that bad, it was a more enjoyable sequel than Part 2, at least from my first viewing, we'll see if that changes in time once I've viewed it a couple more times. It's not bad, and I don't get why fans of this cry about every new film in this franchise that comes out, can't you just enjoy the film, it's not art, it's a horror movie. Now I starting to lean into the hate for Texas chainsaw 3D, so I'm going to end the review now.

While the first sequel, dominated by Dennis Hopper's crazed performance, explored the key figures in a novel way, LEATHERFACE is a film that's content to simply emulate the first movie's storyline. Once again we get unwary travellers falling foul of Leatherface and his family, and an extended climax involving a family dinner. It's all way too familiar, and of course lacks the sheer intensity of Tobe Hooper's original classic.The film's tone is wildly uneven throughout, and even in the would-be horror scenes it's hard to take it seriously. The movie feels like a spoof; it has a light-hearted tone that sits at odds with the grimness of the plot. Still, on the plus side, it's very fast paced, and it features a great deal of crowd-pleasing horror elements that are sure to win the hearts of splatter fans, although as with the original, it's never quite as gory as you think it's going to be (and I'm talking about the uncut version).One of those crowd-pleasers is Ken Foree, Mr. DAWN OF THE DEAD himself, playing one of the film's would-be victims. Foree is a delight, and they sure play up to his potential, portraying him as a real ass-kicker of a man. I couldn't care less about the two characters who are supposed to be the leads, but Foree hooks you right from the start. The rest of the actors are less than impressive, and in particular the guy who plays Leatherface is just a stock heavy; there's certainly none of the hulking, imposing brutality that Gunnar Hansen brought to the role.Of course, one of the draws watching this film today is seeing a pre-stardom Viggo Mortensen playing in a decidedly odd type of role, completely different from what you might expect; I enjoyed his performance, even if much of it is played for laughs. And that's the trouble with the film as a whole we're back to that spoofy tone, that whole non-serious feel that everyone's laughing at the premise rather than getting to grips with the horrifying implications of it. Take the ear scene, for example, or the string of increasingly ridiculous and unbelievable things that happen at the climax (including the fate of one of the characters, which makes no sense whatsoever; blame a substituted ending for that one, after the original didn't go down too well with test audiences). In fact, come the end, I enjoyed this more as a bizarre comedy than as a genuine horror outing. "},{"Title":"An honest attempt at a sequel. TheFlaws are not its fault.","Date":"24 April 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 (1990)Director Jeff Burr (Stepfather 2)**1/2outof****ReviewMan, I really wanted to like this movie. I probably should give the movie a less then favorable review, but after the special features and commentaries, I feel compelled to stick with it. A step up from the previous entry, there isn't a comedic aspect in sight. Some morbid humor here and there, but ultimately this sequel attempts to go the serious route, and for me that's good. The original movie was the landmark classic, one of the only movies that I admit actually scares me on a visceral and psychological level. The sequel wasn't warranted but since the greed of the eighties thought otherwise, we have a franchise. This sequel is more of a refined version of the original that hints at being a sequel while at the same time is more of just a semi-remake. We have a bickering couple Michelle (Hidden 2's Kate Hodge) and Ryan (Friday the 13th part 7's Bill Butler) traveling across Texas, they eventually succumb to the dirty and desolate gas station, where foul play and misguided directions leads them to the clutches of Leatherface and his demented family. They are aided by survivalist Benny (Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree). Thankfully he has a semi automatic and knows a thing or two about being hunted. There's also a backwoods girl running away, but she is marked as expired food, and we shouldn't invest too much in her. The movie has a nice music video look to it, it has no grittiness like 1, but isn't overwhelming with colors like 2. It's polished, bleak, and has that hopeless feeling down pat. Jeff Burr actually succeeds with some tension and suspense. Just watch the changing flat tire scene alone at night by yourself, and you certainly feel your adrenaline pumping. Leatherface's new look is also quite menacing, and his leg brace is responsible fro some tense scenes. The family is also quite effective. I liked the chemistry, and Tex (Viggo Mortenson) stole the show as the stylish weasel like brother. The little girl was also disturbing and ambiguous. I enjoyed grandpa's cameo. The gore in this movie is also quite effective, but has the MPAA hovering over the entire show. Lot's of cuts and murky darkness hides what are obviously sick and twisted gore bits. Like the bisection of the backwoods girl or the sledge hammer to head bit. As Jeff Burr stated, If your making a sequel to Texas Chainsaw, you better believe it's going to be gory. Indeed. The ending is the biggest cheat I've seen from MPAA. The music by Burr regular Manzie was also a nice touch. It was a mix of action and creepiness (with a dash of Metal as well) that made the movie move along nicely. I especially liked the music while Benny is trying to get bullets with Tink waiting to attack. The music was also used (less effectively) in Burr's Pumpkinhead 2. This leaves us to the script, which received the most butchering of anything involved with this production. David Schow, he penned the 2005 remake and some unaccredited work for Nightmare 5 Dream Child as well. His ear for dialog is awful, most of the time our couple in peril usually had to spit out some crappy lines that were laugh out loud funny, why did Ryan feel the need to say things that were happening out loud? Like the Oh my god, there coming from behind us or the Oh my god, what do they want from us, or Michelle's Violence is no answer to Violence made my ears bleed and took me out of the movie, since I doubt no tolerable human being would speak in such a contrived way. Also, why do the events seem a bit underwhelming and uneventful? After it was over, my friends in attendance were like That's it? I feel a lot more could have happened, like some decent background info on the family of loons, or some more brutal events in our finale. It feels a tad flimsy. The movie alas still has an anchor and that's its good intentions from all those involved. I feel that Texas chainsaw never needed sequels, they aren't as endearing as Nightmares or Friday the 13ths, its story was told in one, and that's that. Thankfully though, the effort has a touch or horror class, which makes it all the more acceptable, while still being a problematic production. The more I think about it, the more I believe that it is the best sequel out there.

As with most horror movies I see, it was late at night and I just wanted to watch something to pass the time. I'll admit off hand that I have not seen the original (although I've heard enough of it where I could retell it shot for shot, just about). And I have seen the horrid 2003 remake (I was at a party, and we all found it hilarious). So given that my only true experience with the franchise was the remake, and that horror series degrade at an extremely high rate, I felt that this might be my first disappointment with the IFC. I was wrong.It was the acting, first and foremost, that surprised me. It was more than average, it was actually good (whereas most horror movies, I find, have absolutely dreadful actors). I was surprised to find Viggo Mortenson in here, but I suppose you have to start somewhere. He was without question the best actor involved, giving an eerie and menacing (although not frightening) performance. While he clearly has a way to grow from this early performance, his talent is obvious.The woman who played the female protagonist did a good job in her role. She didn't degrade into a shrilly screaming mess, nor did she seem immune to the terror around her. She showed a realistic and gradual development due to what was happening around her.The little girl, as played by Jennifer Bonko, had the only part that was frightening. Why was it frightening? She was a little girl, and had the most sinister actions of the family. Her skeleton-littered room was juxtaposed beautifully with her painfully cute appearance, and her doll was a disturbing touch. Why the female lead would think nothing amiss about her, I have no idea. While Viggo does the best acting job, Jennifer gives the most memorable performance.The rest of the cast did a good job as well. Ken Foree gives a well-done, although forgettable, performance, as does William Butler and Joe Unger. Really, that's what the entire movie can boil down to in the end well made, but still forgettable.The direction was pretty well done. It has a gritty feel to it, more like some low-budget movies made in the 70's and 80's rather than one made in 1990. That, I think, is part of it's success with me. It seemed dark and gritty in an old, and almost dated, way.While this film never frightened me, it does have some highly memorable moments. The dead father who was fed blood was a somewhat disturbing image, especially with all of that blood staining the front of his shirt.Leatherface, unlike in the 2003 remake of the original, looked terrifying. In fact, that whole Mr. Spell sequence with the picture of the clown was very well done. Also, as I mentioned above, the little girl was just all-around the best part of this movie.The forest was highly atmospheric and well shot, and the crazed girl was extremely well done. I would have loved if she had stuck around a bit longer and been more developed. As it was, she was used only as a plot-device to give Foree's character the lighter and to build the clan up more in the audience's eyes.The beginning had a well-made introduction. And the uncovering of the mass grave was an excellent way to foreshadow the movie. However, the sequence between and including them hitting the armadillo and going the gas station was slow and ill-shot. It served a purpose, but could have been made to serve it better. The ending is entirely wasted. They chose the wrong clansman to come back for the final scare. That little girl would have been perfect for the job, absolutely perfect, and much more frightening to boot. Other than that, my only complaint is that the new shiny chain-saw didn't have the same dark and gritty feel as the old one he had.This passes off as an average horror movie. It's an entertaining way to pass a few hours, and includes several memorable ingredients to it. Fans of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, I'd imagine, should like this movie. Fans of Viggo Mortensen might find this early performance of his enjoyable. And fans of horror, even the milder ones, should find this a campy and enjoyable movie.It falls into that category of movie that pushes no envelopes; one that's mild enough for the more squeamish and violent enough for the more fortified constitutions. It's not great, but neither is it bad. It's only decent, and will never be any more or less.

It required tremendous effort on the part of director, Jeff Burr (who brought us the creepy anthology, Offspring and Stepfather 2) to get the studio to release Leatherface in a very stripped-down and incoherent theatrical R-rated version who's cuts are overwhelmingly noticeable. Thanks to the DVD revolution for restoring it back to a better but still incomplete edition with most of its nihilistic content in tact. The story's the same, but the departure from the original includes many unique touches and a whole new family of cannibalistic psychopaths including... Viggo Mortenson, Joe Unger and R.A. Mihailoff as Leatherface. Kate Hodge and William Butler are the hapless victims and Ken Foree is a survivalist in on the action. Excellent set pieces including a sledgehammer head-shot concoction with a rope trigger, a shiny, custom-made chrome chainsaw with The Saw is Family engraved on the blade and various traps and gags add to the originality. (The family's last name is Sawyer) A cute but sadistic little girl, a mama that speaks through a hole in her throat and other various twisted characters contribute to the insanity as this family that slays together exhibits a strange and dualistic comradery. Viggo Mortenson is great in his early role as Eddie I told you to call me Tex, Ken Foree is in top form and the script is comedic and witty. Some inconsistencies remain. The Alternate ending is much better since the re-appearance of Foree's character after getting a chainsaw to the head makes no sense. Look for Caroline Williams Stretch from Texas Chainsaw 2 in a brief cameo, and just sit back and have fun with this twisted little flick for what it is, and to whom it may concern...

The main aspect to this that works really well is the impressive atmosphere, with the film being rather creepy despite being set at night but it makes the film just that much better because the majority of the action takes place at night and that is really tough to pull off, yet it's done nicely here. The gore is great as well, with plenty of gruesome, bloody moments that are far more squirm-inducing than expected, and coupled with some fine jump moments and a nasty streak that runs throughout, this one isn't quite as bad as is generally reported. There's still some flaws here, as the family again changes around members needlessly, the original 'rated' cut of the film is virtually bloodless and with a low body count to chop up, it doesn't have a lot of deaths to dole out.

Friday the 13th at least ups the body count and devises interesting ways to kill people and Nightmare on Elm Street has cool effects-laded dream sequences, but what does Texas Chainsaw Massacre have a guy with a skin face mask and a chainsaw chasing people around the woods. That's about it. For a ponderous example of why this franchise is going nowhere fast, just take a gander at the third entry in the series, Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III.The plot to this entry is inconsequential, but if you want the reader's digest version Michelle (Kate Hodge) and Ryan (William Butler) are driving cross-country through Texas and make the bad mistake of stopping at a gas station run by peeping tom psycho Alfredo (Tom Everett) who gets put out with the couple and forces them to flee or meet with the business end of his shotgun. Just before leaving the gas station in a hurry, they are given a shortcut route through the back country by drifter Tex (Viggo Mortenson, yes that Viggo Mortenson). They make the unwise decision of taking the route and end up with their car broken down and a giant guy with a chainsaw and poor manners when it comes to greeting guests on their tail. They run into (literally) survivalist Benny (Ken Foree) who quickly becomes chainsaw bait also. With both vehicles out of commission, and a power tool that is just itching to be covered in the thick red stuff right behind, they quickly begin wandering the woods and find a farm house containing (imagine this) crazy people! Mayhem ensues, unhappiness abounds and lots of screaming occurs. Oh yeah, and people die.Leatherface is lowest common denominator horror film-making it takes a familiar premise, changes a few of the characters, juggles the deaths a bit, and slaps a roman numeral on the end and calls it a film. It is an almost complete rehash of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre in content, lacks any significant scares, has characters that are as thin as rice paper, and looks like it was made for about what I currently have in my wallet. Michelle and Ryan are almost non-existent characters, they are bodies for the slaughter and that is it. Benny is a little more entertaining, but not much. The villainous family are all freaks sure, but by round three, the ability for their behavior to shock is pretty much gone. I suppose it is a sad commentary on pop culture when the gruesome acts of despicable people on film has become so blasé as to be boring, but that is where it stands.It is also interesting that even though this film barely clocks in at an hour and twenty minutes, it feels like it goes on for an eternity. The film has no visual interest, it's just random woods photographed with competence, and that is it. No style, no flair, it's just there. For those gorehounds who view these films for its extensive bloodletting, Leatherface is sure to disappoint. Even in its unrated version, most of the grisly stuff is off-screen, so those in search of the horror film equivalent of the money shot will be unsatisfied.Yeah, Viggo Mortenson is in it, and he's okay, but nobody's winning any awards here. Kate Hodge varies between decent and terrible, and R.A. Mihailoff, who essays the role of Leatherface, doesn't have to work too hard to collect his paycheck. More or less, this is just an attempt by a film studio to cash in on the name Texas Chainsaw Massacre with no real meat on the bones of this sequel. You have been warned.

The studio was looking ahead to a sequel more than they were concentrating on making this picture work. Second, because of the huge success of the first film (among genre fans) anything which followed was going to draw a lit of criticism. Do the filmmakers simply mimic the original, or do they completely break the mold? Usually what you get is a mishmash of both theories and that's what you have here. That said, Leatherface is lot of fun if you like a balls -out gore fest with some humor and better production values than the budget warranted. Director Jeff Burr creates a deliciously-crazed atmosphere while driving thestory home. This is also a very fine looking movie and kudos go to the director of photography, whose name escapes me. The cast is excellent. Mortensen looks like he's having a lot more fun here than in the Rings movies and Kate Hodge is very under appreciated. There's a good role for genre veteran Ken Foree too and he delivers the goods. By the way, the chainsaw in this one is a real beaut. Leatherface is a very solid B-movie effort.

How can I call myself a horror fan (which, for the record, I don't) having seen only bits and pieces of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, one of the most demented movies of all time? I have wanted to see TCM for a very long time, and the saw that split the camel's back was the film's original trailer, which I recently saw as part of the Boogeymen DVD collection.  I was in awe of the 2 minutes of film presented in said trailer and rushed to the video store to rent this horror masterpiece.  Unfortunately, I was in a hurry and accidentally picked up this box instead.  Really, I've heard of sequels killing a franchise, but this one guts the franchise, then neatly prepares it for Grandpa.First off, the film-print used in filming is top-notch.  Normally, this would be a good thing, but part of what made the original TCM so freaky and gave it that unique charm is that the film was shot on grainy 16mm, with fairly bad colors, which left it looking like a first-hand home video account of the horror.  This looks more like a high-budget, low-spirit remake of the original than a true sequel.  Which is a fitting description since that's exactly what it is.Every attempt at a shocking scene in this movie was stolen from the original or one of the many flicks inspired by TCM.  The acting is amazingly unextraordinary, with the exception being the sole survivor from a group that was abducted and killed a few days in before this story (fittingly enough, she gets in one set of dialogue before she is separated and killed) and Leatherface's little sister, who is genuinely unsettling from first encounter (she holds tea parties with skulls and a doll made from what looks like a mummified infant), but is also barely given any screen-time.  The story of Leatherface and his family told in the original movie was pretty horrifying but perhaps not realized to its fullest ability because of budget and technological limitations, so it would seem that remaking it with a better budget and technology would work, but, besides the factor of the film not looking right with a better film-stock and higher budget, the higher budget meant there was more financial influence, which more simply means it was cut to ribbons by the censors (what's the point of supposedly-brutal killing scenes if there's barely any gore in the film at all?!), and had its original ending (see Alternate Versions) changed to the awful, unfitting happy ending it now has.  A conflict between Leatherface and his father that would've been very interesting was hinted at, but never fully attempted (although Leatherface did burn his father's hand in the oven so he could get a favored tape back).  The only part of this film I truly enjoyed was a darkly humorous scene in which Leatherface is playing with an electronic children's toy, and becomes frustrated when it shows him a picture of a clown, asks him what it is, and keeps telling him his answer of food is wrong.  The rest takes all the originality, edginess, and dementia of the original and chucks it for an incredibly boring feature.The reason this tragedy of a film happened to such a great franchise was obvious.  Nobody from the original was involved at all in this; Tobe Hooper had no involvement in this, and New Line was even too cheap or stupid (or both) to get Gunnar Hansen, the only true Leatherface (R.A. Mihaillof, the new guy, doesn't have near as threatening a pose, or the cool one-armed chainsaw spinning moves).  Made in 1990, over 15 years after TCM, this is just another case of poor, unnecessary sequels hoping for a quick buck and destroying the good name of the original film.  Next time I'll make sure to pick up the right box...

Our favorite chainsaw wielding, human-skin wearing maniac has a new look, but with a more childlike personality as he goes by the name Junior by his new cannibalistic family that doesn't deliver that sadomasochism feel that radiated from the first sequel. But Junior has a sweet new toy to finish his dirty work in this moderately gore-filled, decently acted, but tacky third entry.The story kicks off with a couple from California driving cross-country to drop off a classic Mercedes to a relative in Florida. But their relationship isn't the only thing about to hit a rough patch as they make their way through the infinite miles of rural Texas. Making a pit stop at the cliché gritty gas station, they are met by the perverted owner Alfredo where we see homage to the original TCM with the spontaneous Polaroid-for-cash scene that's more annoying than funny. But after meeting the enlightening, but deceiving, Tex (Viggo Mortensen), and entangled in a shootout that ensues, the frantic couple end up getting into a car wreck fleeing for help.But only to their benefit does a survivalist, Benny (Ken Foree, Dawn of the Dead, The Devil's Rejects), stumble upon the endangered protagonists to fend against the eventual Leatherface and his sadistic clan. Director Jeff Burr, who is also known for such films as Stepfather II and the fourth and fifth entries in the Puppet Master franchise, places at least half of the film's setting within the woods. This leads to many dark scenes, including one of the more grotesque in the beginning when we see an excavation of a body pit. The casting of Foree gives a nice touch from a veteran who has experience in horror, although the water fight finale between himself and Leatherface may be a bit over the top. But somehow we see Benny still awake and alive in the end after it was already perceived that Leatherface had finished him off.With R.A. Mihailoff filling the shoes of Leatherface this time around, he does a stable job with the spontaneous movements and frustration that his character makes up for from the absence of actual dialogue. The brothers Tinker and Tex provide a credible sense of madness, but to more of a comic-relief approach. But ultimately the look of the characters just don't give off that peculiar feel like the first two films, especially the daughter who seems far too ordinary and out of place. Although it was on Tobe Hooper's agenda to be involved with the film, he eventually decided on the contrary due to scheduling conflicts with his latest film at the time Spontaneous Combustion. Slasher-honcho Kane Hodder even granted a helping hand as stunt coordinator for the film.Overall, I can say this was somewhat of a fun movie. It doesn't live up to the acting or thrills of part two, but, at the same token, it definitely is not the worst of the franchise (Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger as hints).

This sequel focuses more on the gore and raw factor. There's some room for cheesy black humor and cheesy one-liners from characters that take a bad-ass attitude. Also, I need to urge you to get the UNRATED version.; that is the real Leatherface experience. Although the movie goes by the name of Leatherface; he has not that much chainsaw action or memorable sequences. In fact, his look has little to do with the one from the previous TCM movies. Sure, he has his good amount of kill scenes, and even a cheesy scene featuring a spelling machine for kids but there isn't enough Leatherface on-screen time. Leatherface even gets his own song, trailer, and more. He even gets a brand new, spectacular, memorable big shinny yellow chainsaw. That's a chainsaw I would even like to use. But I would praise director Jeff Burr for continuity details. For example, Leatherface has an electronic device in his right leg; following the ending of the original TCM. And some other little details that you will find about. The new characters have a different personality but are obviously inspired by The Cook and Chop-Top. But still each of the new characters are really likable and their personal features are to dig about. The little girl steals the show with her sadistic behavior. Ken Foree reprises his role from Dawn Of The Dead with a few differences. He does not wear a soldier outfit (although at some point he is asked by a girl if he's a soldier!), and he does not have a powerful weapon. He changes army glamour for old Texas country music and primitive fighting style. Heck, the man gets beaten by almost every member of the Saywer family, he gets a chainsaw through his skull, and other things but he manages to survive. Not even the zombies from the Romero 1978 masterpiece were able to keep him down. Foree delivers a great performance as the badass lead. Jeff Burr does a great job as director. He creates tension, unsettling atmosphere, and violence in most of the scenes. He has a good vision and demonstrates it. Leatherface is a dark movie with great direction and fast pacing. Talking about the movie's pace; I think it's decent enough because it goes directly to the point and covers the basic aspects a Horror movie needs to have. There's a decent amount of great gore, action, and tension sequences. Great job. The torture sequences were greatly done.Now, this movie is heavily underrated and has been critizied for it's part III label. Give it a try. You won't regret. Recommended for TCM fans or Horror followers overall. It's not just another slasher flick although some cheesy lines and scenes pop-up. For example why do you do this to us? Because he have to eat. Have you ever heard about pizza??!. Gee. The movie starts as the other Massacre movies. You know, people on their car have the bad luck to stop at the Last Gas Station and that's when everything starts. A couple who is on their way to Florida stops there and suddenly are insulted and spied (who will understand later) by Alfredo; and there they meet Tex; a Texas cowboy. Little they know that they perform a fake act in order to lead them to the infamous death route that always ends in the Saywers house. On the road, they are attacked by Leatherface, they crash their car against a black rude man with a horrible attitude but with a good heart named Benny, and they find their fatal fates. Not the trip they planned huh? Join the couple, the black tough guy, and the favorite cannibal family in the ultimate Chainsaw movie. This is how a Horror movie from the 90's should be.

But for every flaw, there is a good quality to counteract it. Yes, this movie does have some great assets, first off, a wonderful cast. Ken Foree (the original Dawn Of The Dead) plays Benny, the cool, rational, tough guy to a T. This guy is the man, I wish I could see him in more movies. Viggo Mortensen makes a pre-fame appearance here as a Tex, a relative of Leatherface who seems to have a fetish for finger-nail polish. There are plenty of other colorful characters sprinkled throughout. Also, (I am speaking of the Unrated version), the gore is top notch, we get it all Hands nailed to chairs, chainsaws to the head, stomach and everywhere between. And let's not forget the excellent shoot-out towards the end (fingers getting shot off!). I know it sounds sick, but the gore actually elevates this movie and adds to the entertainment. It gets so cartoony towards a certain point that it becomes humorous. There is also a sub-plot about a survivor hiding out in the woods that I wish they would have ellaborated a little more on, but you can't have it all. But as I said before, this movie has it's problems. It is heavily noted on the DVD documentary that TCM3 was the victim of too many edits to many cooks in the kitchen. The result is an unfocused, uneven horror flick. Also, the movie doesn't fit in with the first sequels because it betrays continuity (*spoiler* Leatherface died in TCM2; he returns here unharmed and unexplained). Also, the new family, while very interesting, came out of left-field and wasn't explained. Sure, there are countless theories about how all of this works, ask any TCM fan, and they have their own take on it. But at the end of the day, this movie was obviously made ignorantly with no intentions of keeping a story intact (even the Halloween series is more consistent). With all of that said, however, this movie is not as bad as most people would have you believe. It has plenty of treats for horror fans, and if you can just let go of it's flaws and errors, and watch the unrated version (R-rated version is virtually useless), you will find something you like in this movie.7/10 "}{"Title":"Well, hes back and this time he has a nice shiny new saw","Date":"23 March 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Im a very big fan of the original TCM and after buying the special edition dvd and veiwing the trailers for the 2,3 and 4 i had to get hold of copys of all the sequels.

It does leave a lot of questions unaswered though but from what i can gather it is not because of bad direction or script it was because the film negative was cut down a lot by new line cinema due to its graphic scenes of violence which caused some of the story get lost which also happened in TCM 2. The film itself concentrates on pair of collage students who get lost on a deserted texas road and fall prey to leatherface and his new family.

In it, Leatherface and Grandpa some how suddenly end up in a new family, and although they are extremely twisted and entertaining, it's sad that there is no reference to the Cook, the Hitchhiker, or Chop Top. Also, I definitely think they made the character of Leatherface too intimidating. In the first two films, Leatherface is bossed around by his family members, yelled at, and even beaten. But, that is who he is.He's the one that does all the work, catching victims, and then gets yelled at and beaten by his demented family anyway. However, in Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III he is the one who beats up on the other members in his family, like when he forces the metal handed family member to reach into the oven. That is certainly something the real Leatherface would never do. All in all, despite these flaws, this was a creepy flick, it was gory, hysterically funny, mind numbingly horrifying, and even though it wasn't like the other, you may want to take a look at it.

Yeah sure, we know and love that characted, however giving it such a name segregates it from rest of the series when you wonder around your video store. (i manage a video store and this problem is more irritating than you can know)The second mistake they made was to splice out the violence. When you watch the R rated version of this movie, it is just appalling. It's a disgraceful film. What were New Line thinking? - They had previously produced the 'Nightmare on Elm St' movies which were packed with gore.... why remove it from a movie that's subject is 'Chainsaw MASSACRES'? It's mind boggling.However, if you get a chance to see this movie in all of it's Un-Cut glory, then you're in for a small treat. Push the first two Chainsaw Massacre movies out of you mind. They were fantastic, but we move on to Leatherface.... who (somehow) has found a new adopted family just as demented as his previous one. (dont ask me how Grandpa came along with him). This family is not quite as grotty and disturbing as the previous, but they are fun and the little girl's over acting is pretty funny.Robert Shaye (producer) insisted on giving Leatherface a nice new Buzz-Saw which is bigger than Leatherface himself....I dont know why, but the bigger the saw the less scarier it is for me. But who cares?Anyway, stick with this one if you're intent on doing the whole series. Restored to it's un-cut nastieness, Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III is a fun late-night-sleep-over movie.

It's another by-the-numbers sequel. After watching it, I was more convinced than ever that making TCM 2 was a wise move on Tobe Hooper's part. He realized he couldn't outdo the original on his own terms, so he did something completely different. The result was an interesting, if not always successful, dark comedy. He must also have realized that there simply aren't that many story possibilities inherent in the material, aside from Leatherface chasing his victims. Therefore, he made it so that there could be no more sequels--or so he thought--by making it clear that the killer was dead for good. Still, logic is rarely a priority when determining the next step for a horror series, so what they did this time was to simply ignore TCM 2 and make TCM 3 a sequel only to the original. Not the most creative move, but it got the job done. At least they didn't rip off Friday the 13th, Part VI and bring him back as a zombie.Same old, same old. There is very little that wasn't done in Hooper's terrifying original, of which this entry is a pale shadow. It's competently made, with a few thrills here and there, mostly in the second half. As a whole it's completely forgettable, with a ridiculous miraculous recovery at the very end. The closest thing they do to being original is the added touch of Leatherface's daughter, who is just as barbaric as the rest of the family. It's admittedly a bit unsettling, but I'm sure a similar character has appeared in some other (hopefully better) horror film. At least the chainsaw itself looks impressive, and R.A. Mihailoff makes a credible Leatherface. Likewise, Kate Hodge gives a good try as the heroine. However, William Butler is simply annoying as her traveling companion. (To be fair, he has some poor dialogue to work with.)I am aware of the troubled production history of this project. Studio executives forced script rewrites after finding the original script too nasty for their tastes. Did they know they were making a movie with chainsaw and massacre in its title? Furthermore, the MPAA, the horror genre's deadliest foe, threatened to slap the film with an X rating, forcing more changes. At least they did release an unrated version on video. This movie is pretty weak as it is; at least the added blood makes it a bit more entertaining. To the best of my knowledge, the laserdisc (unseen by myself) is the closest to the filmmakers' original vision. I am not confident that there is any version of the material that will have a significant impact on my evaluation of the film. However, I am willing to give it a chance if it ever sees a DVD reissue.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema "},{"Title":"A little cheesy but I enjoyed it","Date":"13 August 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  This movie was kind of corny I will admit but as a fan of both the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the subsequent sequel I enjoyed this.

Of course, nothing beats the original, but this one is probably my second favorite in the series, as it is better than the goofy, overlong Part 2 and the clumsy, laughable Part 4. Again, it's more of a remake this time out, with yuppies Michelle and Ryan, survivalist Benny (the great Ken Foree) and some mental chick fleeing Leatherface and his new clan, which includes the hunky Viggo Mortensen, who sadly does not show off his muscular, sweaty body, some older guy, a woman in a wheelchair who talks through this weird, robotic voice thing, and an evil little girl. This installment in the series starts off well enough, with Michelle and Ryan terrorized by two of the loony family members at the Last Chance Gas Station and then pursued by Leatherface after they have car trouble and have to pull over to change the lug nuts on one of their tires. Ken Foree basically tries to help Michelle and Ryan, and the crazed young girl attempts to warn the potential victims as she has been hiding out from Leatherface for nearly a week after her and her sister were run off the road by the crazy clan. I think what hurt this film the most is the terrible editing and the existence of various cuts, some with alternate scenes, more gore, different dialogue/music, etc. The best would probably be the 85 min. unrated version which includes about 4 minutes more footage than the original R-rated cut. Overall, the movie just seems too short and near the end has a lot of huge logic loopholes and sloppy mistakes, many of which includes Leatherface's demise and what happens to Ken Foree's character. Kate Hodge, as Michelle, is basically doing the Marilyn Burns thing, becoming more crazed as the film reaches its peak. She was alright I guess, but I definitely didn't like the whiny character of Ryan. Viggo was good (and very hot) and Leatherface was only slightly effective. He was definitely better than the corny, womanish Leatherface of Part 4, but he still was basically there for a lot of comic relief (the scene with his lessons is absolutely hilarious). In short, this film makes very little sense but has a lot of gruesome, dark humor that works better than it did in Part 2, and it has great performances from sweaty men Viggo Mortensen and Ken Foree. It does have some elements that are frighteningly effective, including Leatherface stalking Michelle and Ryan as they try to fix their tire, and the torture endured by Michelle as she tries to free herself after having her hands nailed to a chair. If you're a Chain Saw fan, you should probably see this. And go for the unrated version.

Most start out groundbreaking. Then the second entry just doesn't satisfy as much as it could have. It had bits and pieces that demonstrated there were possibilities, but the advances were not taken further enough. Then there's the third installment, which most consider to the worst with the least amount of care or effort put into the mix to make any kind of decent product. Some chapters however do step up to the plate from time to time. Some are quite obvious to what has more of the upper hand over the rest, while others however are up for more of a debate on what really was the worst. It just depends on what was found to be of better quality in the production (and that doesn't just mean visuals). The story for this sequel is as copy and paste verbatim as it gets. When a couple, Michelle (Kate Hodge) and Ryan (William Butler) travel through Texas from California to get to Florida, they run into the alleged Sawyer family. It is that straightforward; there's nothing else. Why should writer David J. Schow even get writing credits for this? Well, even though his story telling skills are very mediocre here, he still manages to draft a couple of acceptable characters but that's about it. On their travels the couple encounters Benny (Ken Foree, best known from George A. Romero's Dawn of the Living Dead (1978)). Of these characters, the only few that remain somewhat interesting are Michelle, Benny and some of the sick-minded Sawyer family. Hodge, like other actresses give their lead courage at certain instances and that's commendable. Foree is praiseworthy in his role because he at least provides good support to the leads. As for some of the Sawyer family, the thing that makes them fun to still watch is how they act as a family; what makes them have a good time and how they improved their way of hunting for food. One of the creepier Sawyer family members is the mom played by Miriam Byrd- Nethery.As for the other actors, they are intriguing to see at such an early time but they do not provide anything worth while to the plot. William Butler (who would later be the creator behind the el-cheapo Charles Band The Gingerdead Man (2005) franchise) plays an unlikable match to Michelle and does nothing but nags and complains. R.A. Mihailoff as Leatherface is decent but doesn't give the infamous killer any kind of personality other than trying to make a toy understand he wants food. And what's the hair? Is that Jeff Daniels' hair from Dumb and Dumber (1994)? Joe Unger and even Viggo Mortensen have defining roles but don't exactly make themselves act differently from other characters before. On a production level, the only areas that look decent are the special effects, gore and cinematography. Unfortunately, with lots of the original gore being cut, it isn't always on screen but when it is, it is still grotesque and ugly. The camera-work by James L. Carter is acceptable. Nothing groundbreaking but at least is lit in a way that conceals its antagonists rather than putting them out in bright neon lights like the first sequel.The only other possible credit that can be given to Schow is at least reverting the tone back from being too goofy from that of Tobe Hooper's first sequel. However, this does not excuse the giant gaping holes in this particular sequel's story. Like the past two films, the opening credits begin after narration explaining the events of the past. The difference for this is that this entry seems to be taking place after the first but before the second film. Yet there's a slew of contradicting evidence to try and prove this true. At the end of the first movie, Leatherface cuts his leg so this would support it being an intermediate sequel because in this movie Leatherface has a leg brace. But then there's issue of when did Leatherface have a totally different family and,...a daughter? But this has to be true, because Leatherface was impaled and blown up in the second film right? There's even a scene with actress Caroline Williams (who played Stretch in the previous sequel) playing a reporter. So was Stretch initially a news anchor before a radio host? But the title to this movie clearly states the it's the third.....well at this point it's undetermined. Then there's the issue of unexplained errors either for characters or events. This for the most part goes parallel to the time in which this film takes place in accordance with the prior films before it. Sometimes parts of this movie alone feel like it was made for a Friday the 13th film, that means including false jump scares and unreliable truths shown on screen. This film is also one of the few to not follow the cliché horror tropes but only through one of these unexplained errors, so its hard to say if it counts really. Finally, the music is an even further step down. Forget what was said about Hooper's score from the first sequel. The musical score composed by Jim Manzie and Patrick Regan is even more unoriginal. There's no main theme again and there's no frantic sounding synths either. Now it's just notes that drudge through each scene that sound more muddled than usual. Topping that off is an occasional rock anthem that'll blast in and come out of nowhere. It's quite jarring to say the least. This is no wrestling match.It still has the majority of its cast pulling the required weight, the special effects and gore are still good, along with competent cinematography. In spite of that however, its writing suffers from large continuity errors, unexplained justifications and a paper cut out of a plot. The music is also a step down from before, while including unnecessary hard rock in a couple scenes.

Luckily, I spent my 89 or so minutes being pleasantly entertainedHere's the breakdownThe Good--Much, much better than TCM2.--Decent acting, go figure.

Reminiscent of one or two of the Nightmare on Elm Street films.... but I don't remember which one!Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help--Leatherface has a new mask. I didn't care too much for it, but granted, one would expect him to change his skin once in a while. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer Leatherface's old mask from the 70's.--Average music for the most part. The 80's horror cliché of bringing in some wicked Heavy Metal tunes was present here, luckily, it was instrumental and not invasive. Also, it didn't feel as dated or cheesy as a lot of older horror films with Metal music in them. And while I believe no other form of popular (non-orchestrated) music but Metal works or belongs in a horror film, it often just doesn't work and at times, it can ruin the atmosphere. Didn't hurt or help it here. Sounded pretty good.--Roughly the same plot as the first movie--and almost directly stolen for the fourth.--Some pretty good characters, both in the family and in the victims/survivors.--Felt more like a sequel to the first film than the second--which isn't all bad, because most of the second film was bad.The Bad--Leatherface's fancy new saw is barely used.--Story of dug-up pit of corpses in the beginning pans out to nowhere. Only hints relate it to the first film.The Ugly--For some slasher fans, they'll be disappointed that this is not a full-fledged slasher-gore film. It's actually pretty tame for the time and sticks to a lot of the rules set by the first film--off-screen gore and such.--No Gunnar Hansen. In fact, the family is made up of completely new people from the first two films. At least, like the following film, we have a rising star in an early slasher film role Viggo Mortenson.Memorable Scene--The survivalist takes aim on the family.Fun Fact--Stunt Coordinator Kane Jason Voorhees Hodder.--Leatherface wears a leg brace, this idea was carried over to the fourth movie with Matthew McConaughey's character.--The following now-established actors have appeared in TCM films Matthew McConaughey, Rene Zellweger, Viggo Mortenson, Dennis Hopper, Jessica Biel, and R.

As a side note, this can be found in Wal-Mart's $5 bin--and it's one of the best values one is likely to find in that whole pile. I'm going to highly recommend this one, despite the fact that often, opinions of it are very poor. It's one of the most solid films in the franchise and is acted pretty well.

The film was short, only 79min long, but I knew the film had been mutilated by the MPAA(American Censorship Board) and this was clearly apparent when watching the film. However, as a horror film, it was still okay.Now 13 years later, I purchased the DVD edition which contains both the R-rated movie and the Unrated one. The DVD also contains tons of bonus features. I must confess, I was extremely pleased to get my hands on this DVD, as I am a horror enthusiast.The Unrated version is excellent. There is more blood, violence and terror. I feel that the film is under-rated and I honestly believe it's the best sequel in the Texas franchise.It was interesting to compare the R-rated version with the Unrated one. However I do feel that the MPAA was unnecessarily harsh on the film. Silence of the Lambs is just as gruesome but that didn't go through MPAA hell did it. I guess that's because it had big name actors in it, like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.I enjoy watching Texas 3 over and over. I like the film's pace and how the couple are stalked on the road by the huge utility. There is one scene that annoys me though. In the forest Benny is about to be killed by Leatherface but just as Leatherface raises the chainsaw in the air, the crazy girl yells It's me you want, not him. So Leatherface kicks Benny in the guts and starts stalking the crazy girl as she runs away. Now, why did Leatherface kick Benny, it would have been just as easy and quick to have stuck the chainsaw into him and come back and collect his corpse later. Oh, well, it's just a minor flaw.I am aware fan's of the original Texas film were annoyed at how Leatherface has a whole new family in this third installment. All I can say to them is, don't compare this film to the original, just go along for the ride and try not to make comparisons to the first film.Among the bonus features on the DVD there is an alternate ending. However, after watching it, I felt it made little sense, I mean why does the cop car stop and then keep going? I like the film's real ending but Benny should not have survived, I mean c'min, the bloke had his head pushed onto a chainsaw and at the film's finale he returns with just a scratch on his head.

Hell, it was even put on the top bottom movies of IMDb. WHAT A BURN!One of the reasons I also love this movie so much is because of some of the soundtrack which has quite a bit of Thrash Metal such as Laaz Rockit - Leatherface, Sacred Reich - One-Nation, and my personal favorite, Wrath - When Worlds Collide. Also, this movie is the reason why I took the vintage direction into metal, and in particular, Thrash Metal. I think that they should have used more Wrath on the soundtrack using songs like Mutants, Ripped Into Pieces, Hell Is Full, and Painless. Basically, they could have even used their entire album Nothing To Fear Which is why I wrote a script about TCM with Wrath Nothing To Fear as the soundtrack.

The gore is a little nastier, and it should please the gore-hounds looking for a ton of blood and guts. Unfortunately, Leatherface does not get to use his famous 80-pound chainsaw in the film. He revs it, but that is all. The film does have some good jumping moments. Michelle is holding the flashlight in front of Ryan as they are trying to fix the flat tire, and Leatherface emerges into the scene by revving his chainsaw. The family is having their dinner, and suddenly machine gun fire bursts into the room, gunning down most of the family. The actors do a good job, but the one that should've been cut was Viggo Mortensen as Tex, who did very little and wasn't that important to the family. You notice how he was left out of the plot? Foree steals every scene he is in, as Hodge gets more screen, and scream, time. She gave a good performance that at that time would've been given to Jill Schoelen. It was nice to see another young actress in a late 80's, early 90's horror movie. The film is beautifully lit, as the night sets are very spooky and give an unusual atmosphere to the film. It envelops you into the film more so than most of the other movies being released at that time. That is perhaps the film's best quality, as it really shouldn't have been so creepy. Despite the reviews when it came out hammering it for being cut to hell and being incomprehensible, the film is actually pretty understandable.The Bad News Yes, there is an 'R' rated version of the film that is so heavily cut that it makes no sense why it was rated 'R.' Almost no violence at all, very little atmosphere, and just the language made it an R. You get the main gist of the plot, but the overall weakness of the Massacre's, and even Hopper's original makes this mistake, of not having a big cast for Leatherface to cut up. There are only three people in the cast who aren't members of the family, Benny, Michelle, and Ryan. When you include the survivor(s), that doesn't leave a lot of butchering to do. I'd love to see a Massacre film that had the cast the size of a Friday the 13th, where you have double-digit victims to axe. That would be a good film.The Final Verdict Cut to hell, this is still a good film. Not enough blood in the original, but with a bit more suspense than the 'Un-rated' cut. Some of the cast members should've been dropped or switched sides to give Leatherface people to massacre, but it still is a better film than is generally given credit to.Rated R Graphic Language, Graphic Violence "},{"Title":"The Best Ever Texas Chainsaw Massacre Sequel!","Date":"9 May 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  This is my favourite of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Films.

When this film was first released it was not really well received by most viewers. However, now when most people look back on it, they view it as a success. A masterpiece is how I would rate it. I am a big fan of the original, but by no means do I adore the sequel. This attempt,(LeatheraceIII) goes on a different approach compared to the Hooper sequel. It has a good blood flow, great acting, suspense, likable characters and a fantastic script. Jeff Burr was the man in the director's chair for this one and he does such a brilliant job. Then again, this man brought us Puppet Master 4 and 5, Stepfather 2, Night of the Scarecrow, The Offspring, and the Pumpkinhead sequel. Burr is no stranger to the horror genre. He also happens to be a true fan of the horror scene. Simply, I cannot praise this man enough for his cinema talents. I had the chance to meet this man in October of 2003, (Halloween of all days) and he is such a class act. The cast is well acted. You have Ken (Dawn of the Dead) Foree and William (Friday the 13th VII) Butler. Not to mention, Viggo (star of Lord of the Rings trilogy) Mortensen. Mortensen also did a fine job in The Perfect Murder remake by Andrew Davis. Back then, at the time of Leatherface, Mortensen was a no name. However, now he has achieved star status and he's advanced ahead to larger projects. The DVD has been released now for nearly a year. If you are already a fan of this film, then you need to go ahead and purchase this one. It's got a ton of extras that make up for a DVD. All in all, 10 out of 10. This is the best remake of the entire series. The soundtrack is also great, which features the talents of Obsession, Dark Angel and Hurricane.

So, I'm wondering if there really even exists a version in which a man is cut in half and legs are cut off in graphic detail(???)  The story, itself, is all right.  It pretty much ignores TCM II and tries (unsuccessfully) to double the grisly madness of the original by increasing the number of bizarro family members in the new Sawyer clan, including an invalid mother with a voice box, a seemingly normal-looking cowboy son (played by none other than LOTR's King Aragorn, himself, Viggo Mortensen!), and even a homicidal little girl (Leatherface's daughter!)  Kate Hodge and David Cloud play a sort-of couple driving across country who stumble upon the cannibal killers in the middle of a spooky swamp land/desert area.  They also bump into a hard-ass survivalist (Ken Foree, from Dawn of the Dead--whatever happened to him?) who's tough enough to give Leatherface and company a run for their money.  There are some violent and disturbing scenes spread around here and there, and Leatherface (this time played by R.A.

I couldn't find this movie for years and I finally got the chance to watch it on TV and I was pleasantly surprised, they taken away the Horror/Comedy element from the 2nd one and just kept the horror element which I was pleased with and they kept it to a similar tone the first one had. It seems that this time Leatherface has taken up with a new family this time and moved to a different part of the country. The opening of this movie has Leatherface having his wicked way with 2 ladies had me hooked, this sequel is like a pumped up polished version of the first one They were starting over with this one, ignoring part 2, avoiding its slapstick and going for a straight-up, no bull, shockfest with the hopes of giving birth to a healthy franchise, in other words saving the franchise from becoming a farce. Well, for one, Leatherface the man behind the dead skin mask is back with a vengeance and he's in scary mode! He wasn't the pussy he was in part 2 and looked like a psychotic heavy metal head-banger with a leg brace.Although far removed from the gritty feel of the first, it still had some spooky impact to it. The night scenes, in particular, were extremely well shot with an axis towards bleak atmosphere. Another plus was that there was some great ideas here when it came to the physical action. We get a badass truck causing havoc, a brand new chainsaw the size of John Holmes' schlong entering the ring and some booby traps in the woods. Sure, all of those neato devices were never milked to their fullest either due to the restraint that was applied by outside parties (some booby trap stuff was cut out of the film), budget or mishandling, but their inclusions were groovy to witness nevertheless. The flick was also laced with dark humor that had me smirking and sported a mean machine heavy metal soundtrack to boot. Character-wise, although I was disappointed not to see the old family return for this third outing (I missed The Cook!), the new family assembled here was quite likable in their own right. The unit genuinely cared about each other and that vibe was a pleasant contrast when taking into account what they do (kill and eat people). That made for a captivating watch the inclusion of the little girl (played by Jennifer Banko) being my favorite. It's actually hinted that she's Leatherface's daughter (he raped one of his victims). I adored that spin and seeing her be a psycho kiddie was quite a treat.All in all a definite improvement to the franchise one of the best within the franchise.

Then they are lured off the main road and take a deserted track that leads them to Leatherface and his cannibalistic family. Now the pairs' only chance of escaping this demented nightmare rests on a well-prepared survivalist, who they had a car accident with and which has left them at Leatherface's mercy.Well, that just seemed to breeze by with very little impact, but I found Leatherface The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to be rather nasty piece of work that's an exceptionally well-made production. Sure, it's not very explicit because of the MPAA cuts leaving a lot of the real gruel up in the air and causing large continuity shifts in the story. But these factors didn't stop me from mildly enjoying this torturous outing that seems to skip the events that followed on in Hooper's outrageously jokey sequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.It kind of starts off like the original film by providing a voice over dude giving their own interpretation of what had happened after the first flick and there are scenarios that have that rehash feeling about them. Replacing the goofiness of the last feature is a more serious approach that has some dark macabre wit within the script and some crazy antics. There's even a new gimmick involving Leatherface's glistening new chainsaw! Which is the most frightening item you can ever think of, although it would have been great it he got to use it on someone! The problem with the flick was that it looks too clean and really lacks that iron-fisted and repellently grimy nature, because it never gets truly dirty and that ending is totally out-of-place. Again it might look polished, but there is still a ruthlessly unflinching edge about its shocks, but the thing is they are just far from disturbing and lose that subtle realism. Despite all that it efficiently creates an isolated feeling amongst the sticks, the photography is well displayed and an atmospherically Gothic score amplifies a tight knit awe to proceedings. Although it probably could have done without those instrumental, heavy metal cues.The short story is draped with many activities (some rather vague) and characters that come from nowhere and disappear and then reappear. It might be basic, senseless and foreseeable material, but really there was only one thing that got to me and they were the unexplained details and one or two illogical moments. Like Leatherface's new clan and that of Ken Foree's character. The performances were ho-hum, but it's the fun supporting roles by Viggo Mortensen as the subtle one minute to nut-job the next and legendary horror figure Ken Foree as the likable survivalist make it even more enjoyable. Kate Hodge is okay in the lead role as one of Leatherface's prey and R.A.Mihailoff steps up to the plate as Leatherface and does fair job at it and brings back some of that fear associated with that icon. Although anyone accustomed to the original knows no one gets near Gunnar Hansen performance! It's certainly not a great film and does lack the heart of the earlier efforts, but still I didn't mind it and it goes by quick enough if caught in the right mindset.

Though for me the first and original is still the best overall and the two remakes are right up there in my opinion (though I am sure most would disagree with that). Still slasher movies are not my favorite genre in horror, but I like all the Texas chainsaw movies except for four. The first one was the most realistic, two was so 80's and over the top, this one is more serious and more like a typical slasher and the remakes make Leatherface the star. Granted he is in the title here, however he still isn't really in this one all that much. Which is one of my complaints, if you are going to put his name in the title he needs to be more of a focal point than he is. I also could not stand the brother's acting, I could not wait for him to be killed and the ending was a bit happy happy as I wanted the one character to live, but not come back after what happened to him. So the story has a brother and sister going through Texas they run across some crazy happenings at a gas station and end up being pursued by the cannibalistic family. Leatherface is back and they even give him a brace for his leg which is a nice touch seeing as how he did slash himself in the original. He also has more family members as Leatherface went to live with his mother after the cops cracked down on his old place. The only other returning family member is gramps who is not looking to good these days. So if you watch this ignore two as it has nothing to do with this movie and when you watch two ignore this one...you decide which is the sequel for you. I like both of them, but I like this one's more serious tone, it lists comedy after horror here, however, there are only a few jokes this time around. You also get to see Viggo Mortenson and Ken Foree from Dawn of the Dead. So on the whole I did enjoy this movie and I think it was a worthy addition to the chainsaw movies...how they went from this to the mess that was four is beyond me as I thought that one was terrible with no redeeming values. I will say that part two was more bloody too as it had a very good head chop scene...the ratings board most have been really picky in the late 80's and early 90's as this one isn't nothing compared to the two new remakes and yet they had to tone this one down.

Sure its plot is about as obvious as a clumsy stuttering nerd trying to impress a girl, but then its still amplified by the inner-workings of 80s horror put to some dicey uses. It's also got actors like Viggo Mortensen and Ken Foree in roles that are expected and unexpected for actors like them (Foree fits well as a loner who ends up part of the big danger of the 'Family'; Mortensen has an early role here as the 'handsome' guy in the group that is just as dangerous as the others). I remember most when first seeing the film how it wasn't as outrageous or terrifying as the original was, as it seemed more conventionally shot at times. But it still put a nice grip of absurd terror for me in the scenes where the young woman is trapped in the house, in a very tight predicament in a chair in a room. Some of the caricatures are almost too over the top, like the little girl in love with her doll, or the old mother who has a bad voice-box. And, of course, the filmmakers try and extend the very crude, horrifying sense that there might be a human being underneath the mask and the saw. This time, too, they give the chainsaw a new look, all pristine and shiny and designed like a real tool. That the rest of the film cant be as cool as that is a shame, but what do expect in a story of two lost siblings who cant seem to star the car out in the middle of the desert in the middle of the night? It is plenty of dumb fun for fans of the series, though it might be unfavorable if its the first one to see. Not the best, not the worst, its bone-chilling, ridiculous, and delightfully perverted in equal measure, especially in the Uncut version.

The movie begins with a pretty stupid narration &#150; jurors concluded something that is illogic itself and no way explains how leather face is still alive and how the Sawyer adventures continue. You really don't understand what has really happened since Texas 2. Who are these people? What are they doing here, where'V they been during the previous two parts and how can they be connected with Sawyers? Is this some kind of enigma? Awful! I just hope Tobe Hooper hasn't seen it. Nothing comes up with Texas 3. It's amazingly boring, empty predictable. Nothing unexpected! Terror to watch! The plot is a girl and a medic student driving to Texas. On their way they get into some troubles with a freaky and one-eyed guy from the road café where a cowboy (V. Mortensen) saves their lives. After a couple of slight road adventures they get into a real trouble. The acting like everything is very wrong. The cannibalistic family has even a little girl involved now and leather face has too brothers, mother and the same more dead by now grandpa. There's neither atmosphere nor acting. The script is lame. Besides, the house where bad guys live is more like a compact military base, stupid! The casting is wrong, the directress is awful, only the main title score prepares you for the best and that's all. UNAIMABLE MONEY WASTE AND NOTHING MORE! LEAVE LEATHER FACE RIP. AT LEAST DON'T DIG OUT FOR EVERY Crappy SCRIPT. There's only a slightly average scene when leather face's doing his lesson's and dials the word food three times for the clown picture. And that's the only good thing, because there's not single a character to have your attention. Even the potential victims are so lame you don't much care if they'll get killed. You won't even wait for Leather to do it, but take over his duty. Yeah, it's really that bad! Sorry! O out of 10! I'm really sorry.

The fourth Massacre movie is much easier to sit through, even though it's one of the strangest, dumbest, worst movies of all time. As with most bad movies, the weakest link in this one was the story and pacing. It's not exciting when a movie is in a constant climax. You begin to lose interest, and that's where this movie suffers most.Michelle (Kate Hodge) and her boyfriend Ryan (William Butler) are bringing her father's car from Florida to California. Along the way, they stop for gas in Texas, and meet Tex (Viggo Mortenson), a man claiming to be lost. Ryan refuses him a ride, they drive off, and are attacked by a giant monster truck. And, you'll never guess it...Leatherface and his family are at it again. Thrills, chills and spills are nowhere to be found.These Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies are too similar to each other. Sure, they have original characters in each one, but they all end up with the family scaring the protagonist(s), and they're too much alike almost to call sequels. Even Nightmare on Elm Street brought some element of freshness or originality to each film. These are just rehashed over and over again, minus the fourth film, which is in a bizarre league of it's own.The acting wasn't too bad. The lead actors gave okay performances, including an early performance by Viggo Mortenson. It's not as over the top as any of the other movies, and because of that grows boring very fast. The direction was pretty good for what the script allowed. All the action scenes were well shot, though nothing spectacular. The dialogue is okay, meaning there's no lines that stood out as absolutely awful.The story and pacing makes this very hard to watch. The story is the same as the other movies. The pacing consists of a 5 minute opening, a 20 minute introduction to the characters, then a 50 minute climax. It's not exciting to have constant climaxes in movies, it's tiresome, and this movie is nothing but that.My rating * 1/2 out of ****. 80 mins. Rated R for violence and language.

To make it short &#150; I don't have a clue why ever they did cut this one down, it's not overly gory and there is not one single shot where Leatherface slices through someone with the saw and you actually see it&#133;hmm. The Story I won't give too much away, but hey, it's another TCM, so what do you expect? Nothing new or innovative here, either. The Characters Like many other folk around here have already said - the main characters are not very likely, in fact, I found them quite boring and while the boy was some kinda nerd pain in the ass type of guy, the girl just had no personality to speak of. Only time she was okay was at the end of the movie, when she already had gone over the edge. He has not much to say anyway, and goes down after the first half the movie, never to utter another single phrase (not that he had much to say before that). Only glimpse of light on the side of the heroes/victims/nice folk is Ken Foree as Benny, who is not superior, but with the other two so dull, he stand out alone. Character depth is missing here, too - but he has some nice one-liners. Some basic problem with the guys on the good side &#150; there are way too few to make a nice chopping-festival. Four people to go down in a TCM? This could have been overlooked when the rest of the movie would have had more suspense, but alas, it had not. Now the family. Okay, they are not the original ones, and you don't get any explanation where they have come from, why they are here, or why Leatherface is hanging around with them. But, again it's a second grade Horror-Flik, so this did not overly pain me. In addition, they outrank their victims in style and anything else. What I thought rather funny was the fact that they were of course all raving lunatics, but acted as a nice and caring family amongst each other. Last, Leatherface himself. I never liked the original styling from TCM 1&2, with that mob-hair and being a fatty and doing this ridiculous Chainsaw-Wiggle. But then again, this Leatherface also lacks something in terror, style and menace. In my opinion, the new Leatherface from the remake is by far the best looking. Leatherface's first appearance in the movie should have been a shocking, crushing something with Leatherface doing his stunning entry, but he just comes waggling out of the dark, somewhat unmotivated swinging his saw. A rather small one, by the way. He later get's the saw from the poster The Saw is Family and everything, but this nice tool is not only way to polished, chrome-style - but also only used once after it's introduction. Again, Leatherface is a moron, and does some slightly clumsy acts, which could have been relaxing and funny, if not the whole movie was kinda clumsy. Though, I liked the scene where Leatherface is pictured doing his lessons with a little computer, trying to spell Fool right. The theatrical ending of the movie sucks, too, and the cuts they had to do to make it work are too obvious (even the director did not like this ending, so 'nuff said). But on the other hand, the original ending isn't that good or shocking either. Over all, a nice, middle class Horror-Flick, which could have been much better. Some shots and sceneries are nice, but the whole thing just shambles along, neither going into Splatter nor into Not-Splatter-But-Suspense and leaves for a TCM fan like me a rather stale taste, sadly &#150; I wished it would have been better.

I did enjoy how this movie virtually ignores Texas Chainsaw Massacre II. This movie lacks suspense in key areas. I didn't feel any terror with the new family, only doldrums. To be perfectly honest, there isn't that much of a difference in the uncut version other than added gore scenes that were cut out. It's also hard to see at times because of how dark some of the scenes are. The gore is OK. We get nails hammered in people's hands, shotgun wounds, shot off ears and fingers. Leatherface cuts up human flesh, and more. I didn't give a damn about anybody in this film, which was a huge hindrance to my enjoyment. Kate Hodge is solid with what she has to do.

Fortunately, the DVD had the original ending as an extra, and a short documentary showed some of the missing footage, but it's a shame that director Jeff Burr's original vision was screwed around with to such an extent by the MPAA and its studio. Had it been left as was intended by its makers, I think this film would have more fans.Part 3 sees an unhappily married couple (played by William Butler and Beth DePatie), travelling from California to Florida, who are duped (by Aragorn, of all people!) into taking a detour whilst passing through Texas. It's not long before they are running for their lives from chainsaw wielding Leatherface and the rest of the cannibalistic Sawyer clan, accompanied by a weekend warrior (who they quite literally bump into).With plenty of scares (the introduction of the power-tool mad titular character is particularly effective), lots of great gore (KNB provide plenty of yucky moments, but make sure you watch the unrated version PLUS the extras to get maximum enjoyment), and a solid cast (DePatie is a great screamer, Ken Foree is very good as the kick-ass survivalist, and Viggo Mortensen gives a performance worthy of a multi-million dollar blockbuster), Leatherface has plenty to offer fans of the series.I've not watched the R-rated version, and doubt I will.

If it weren't for the excessive profanity, this could've easily covered the PG-13 market because the gore is missing. Even true graphic violence almost always appears off-camera. The ending feels like it was hacked by a chainsaw. And, Benny must have 9 lives, because there are at least three different instances where, for all intensive purposes, he should've been killed. The flick's cannibal clan aren't that demented enough and the direction is rather limp. There's no moment in this flick that raises you to a different level and the photography is just not that effective. The film might increase in quality a notch if the gory bits are inserted, but I'm not sure if even that will help much. The flick is uninspired and silly. Leatherface, despite his BIG chainsaw, isn't that menacing or memorable. Kate Hodge, as the terrorized female, is not very good.

The second movie as silly as it was had it's occasional moments where as crazy as they were you could just try to slide past them and just enjoy the movie. However I did see The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre before I watched this movie, that movie made me wonder how the heck Renée Zellweger and Matthew McConaghey had any kind of career afterwards, believe me it was that bad. So I wasn't so sure how I would handle this movie but figured to give it a fair chance. Even though it's not as bad that movie, it's still not exactly that good. You could tell that the series really took a bad turn at this point. First off I do want to rant a little bit, I got the unrated version of this movie and how in the heck was that unrated? There is barely any blood and even though there is violence, however this still seems very tame as we don't see anyone get chainsawed. I don't know about those who also have this DVD but I feel like I got gypped. Ken Foree is the only thing that made this movie a good time because the two leads didn't exactly carry the movie very well. Michelle and her boyfriend Ryan are both traveling through Texas. At a gas station, they meet a hitchhiking cowboy named Tex and the station's perverted owner Alfredo. Tex shows Ryan a route on the map that can get them to a town. A fight soon breaks out between Tex and Alfredo. As Michelle and Ryan flee from the station in their car. As night falls, Ryan and Michelle, having taken the route Tex recommended, become lost. As Ryan changes their car's flat tire on the road, Michelle, hears a noise, and Leatherface ambushes the two of them. Now they are in for a night of terror with another survivor who just might give the crazy cannibal family a run for their chainsaws.Viggo Mortenson, he's such a baby in this movie, I mean looks wise, it's just weird to see where your roots start I suppose. But again I guess we all have to start somewhere like Renée and Matthew did with that silly movie. The two leads are what really killed the movie since they were beyond terrible and not even in a good way. Plus I wasn't crazy about the family with Leatherface, the house seemed a little too nice for cannibal serial killers and they're not meant to have the whole Hannibal the Cannibal vibe with being first class. I don't know where the little girl came from, was she meant to be the daughter of Leatherface? I'm not sure where the mom came from and the grandpa I'm pretty sure that he's stinking up the house since he's been dead for over a decade. However I did enjoy Viggo and Ken's characters, they seemed to be the only actors having fun and maybe that's why they have careers. I'm not sure if I would recommend this film, it has it's moments and if you want to see the whole series, I would say that it's not a total skip. But just don't expect a treasure, I think it's one of those films you have to let go a little and have fun. But my recommendation to others and myself is to write an angry letter to the DVD company for the unrated non violence. Believe me, compared to Saw -which granted maybe hardened our generation a little more- makes this look like Winnie the Pooh. And also keep our chainsaw gritty, we hardcore fans like our cannibal family riding in trailer trash pick up trucks with the crazy chicken feathers flying while listening to the pleasant rusty roar of our beloved chainsaw.3/10 "}{"Title":"Decent","Date":"13 March 2008","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 (1990) ** 1/2 (out of 4) For those who don't know the legend, apparently director Burr was asked to deliver the goriest film he could possibly imagine.

The former couple thinks it's best to stay on the main road but this is changed after they stop at a filling station where they are shot at by the crazed owner (Tom Everett).While on the back road the couple suffers a flat tire and must get out to fix it. Of course, it's pitch dark and our hero Leatherface shows up swinging his chainsaw like mad. The couple gets away but is soon in another accident with Benny (Ken Foree), a strange man who appears to be after the crazed killer. The three eventually take off running in the woods trying to find safety, which leads them to an old farmhouse, which unknown to them, is full of weirdo cannibals. Now the only question is who will live and who'll become BBQ.TCM3 pretty much forgets the plot of the previous film and the original for that matter. Although New Line called this a sequel it's more of a remake than anything else. Every family member from the first film is pretty much on hand here acting out stuff from the first film. We get the crazy hitchhiker, the nutty gas attendant, grandpa and of course Leatherface supporting a new face. The film tries very hard to capture the feel and atmosphere of the original but it falls short in this department, which is the film's major problem.The film goes for many scares but comes up short on each one of them. The director also tries to show how crazy the family actually is but this here goes pretty over the top where you'll be laughing more than getting scared. The film is a very dark one and it goes for the gore, which comes off very well. Due to the post-production problems there's no telling how much gore is missing but what's on hand is certainly worthy for gore fans. The R-rated cut is pretty much missing all the gore so there's even less to like with that version.I think the film's biggest problem is its screenplay, which doesn't capture the pure gold that they had in front of the camera. Kate Hodge isn't a very good scream queen and she really adds nothing to the character making it hard for the viewing to take her very seriously or to hope she actually survives the night. William Butler plays your typical smart ass character, which we've seen in many horror films so that there doesn't add anything new to the film. However, we've got Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree who steals the show with a wonderfully strong performance. Foree is a big and tough guy and that comes off wonderfully in his various fights with the family members especially the battle between he and Leatherface. Foree delivers some good lines for laughs but sadly most of the time the screenplay has him running around in the woods doing nothing. Had they put him into more of the action the film would have been better off.TCM3 is a legendary horror film due to all the production problems but sadly we've got to judge the film we've actually got here. There are many wonderful scenes especially one where Foree starts shooting the family members who are losing body parts left and right. This here is so over the top that you can't help laugh and cheer Foree on. On the other hand this theatrical version is a mess due to an alternate ending, which was shot and used for the final film. This ending makes no sense and really drags the film down at the very end. TCM3 isn't a classic and it really isn't a good movie yet for some strange reason it's mildly entertaining, which is more than you can say for a lot of horror films. The outrageous gore scenes mixed with Ken Foree's performances makes the film worth seeing but don't expect anything like the original. "},{"Title":"Not too bad, everything considered.","Date":"22 October 2004","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" The third entry into the Texas chainsaw massacre franchise feels more like a remake than a sequel to the original and has absolutely nothing to do with part 2, which in my humble opinion is a very bad thing as I liked part 2, you can check my review out. Anyway, the opening sequence which is mixed together with the credits features Letherface killing a woman with a sledge hammer and stitching the skin from her face together to make a mask. We are then introduced to brother and sister Michelle (Kate Hodge) and Ryan (William Butler) who are traveling across Texas to deliver a car, which their using as transportation. They stop off a gas station in the middle of the desert and get the creepy weirdo attendant to fill the car up. Also there they meet up with soon to be famous Viggo Mortensen who plays Tex. While Michelle goes to the toilet the attendant spy's on her through a hole in the wall. Tex finds out and a big argument ensues. The attendant pulls a shotgun out, Michelle and Ryan speed off in their car while it appears that Tex gets shot. Panicking they decide to take a short cut Tex had told them about earlier and end up going down some road in the middle of nowhere. Before long a battered pick up truck starts to hunt them down, eventually they are attacked by Leatherface, a massive man wearing a mask made of human skin and carrying a large chainsaw! They manage to survive this first attack and speed off in their car once again. However, they are involved in a crash with Benny (dawn of the dead and from beyond star the great always watchable Ken Foree) and are both forced off the road, damaging their cars in the process. And so it begins, can the three survive the Texas chainsaw massacre?! This film has the look and feel of a Hollywood product, very professional but also a little bit soulless and predictable. I have the British special edition DVD which contains the uncut version, there is some good gore and violence here and there but its clear that even this has been cut down, as the DVD's extra features prove, there is some extra gore in the deleted scenes and the filmmakers talk about it in the accompanying documentary, as well as a whole host of other problems. The ending is also discussed, a big let down. The filmmakers were forced to change it so it would be more upbeat, this new happy ending hurts the film. Having said that, I still enjoyed it on a basic horror film level. All the ingredients are there, violence, gore, isolated stranded victims, crazed killers, and a large house in the middle of nowhere. Well made, well paced and good enough, just don't expect the Earth! Worth a watch. "}]
