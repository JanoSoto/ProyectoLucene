How it can be a kind of comedy if the only one laugh is hysterical always and, besides that, the main hero tries to commit a suicide several times? Secondly, it's a story how an unhappy man - despite challenges of life - can find a path into his soul. Okay, this movie isn't an entertainment though. Ir requires much more attention, cerebration than any comedy does. And it forces to think about your place in the world. That's it.

Vonnegut is almostimpossible to film, Slaughterhouse Five is the most successful,while I have reserved a special place in my bowel tract for JerryLewis in Slapstick (of Another Kind).The plot, for what it is, goes a little something like this. Bruce Willisis Dwayne Hoover, who runs a giant car dealership in Midland City.His spaced out wife Barbara Hershey pops pills and watchestelevision all day. His son Lukas Haas is a lounge singer,dropping his first name George in exchange for Bunny. Nick Nolteis Willis' sales manager, a paranoid cross dresser. GlenneHeadly is Willis' receptionist and mistress. Willis does not seemto be going through a midlife crisis so much as a nervousbreakdown. The people around him notice a change to hisbehavior, as his sincere grin flashes on his commercials, whichplay nonstop, he is in his own personal hell.He is asking the question many of us ask why are we here? Ashis life crumbles around him, he sticks a gun in his mouth threedifferent times, never following through with a way out that wouldnot answer his ultimate question. Omar Epps is a released prisoninmate who wants to work for Dwayne Hoover just because theirnames are similar. He probably gets the most mainstreamlaughs, as he lives out of his new car on the car lot, turning it intosomething nicer than a few of my former apartments.Into this nightmarish fray comes writer Albert Finney. He haswritten two hundred novels and two thousand short stories, butthey have all been published by porno mags and hardcore sexnovel publishers. He is invited to Midland City for an arts festival,and the novel he has may contain the answer to life that Willis islooking for.The film lurches along through Willis and company's day.Everyone has a quirk, and that may be a detriment, as the viewerhas trouble latching onto someone to help wade through all theeye candy. Director Rudolph pulls out all the stops, throwing invisual effects that dazzle. He also wrote the screenplay, and showsa true affection for the source novel. Mark Isham's musical score isperfect- Muzak on crack.The performances in this over the top story are uniformally brilliant.Willis has not been able to be this loose onscreen in a very longtime, and he seems to be having a ball. There are no bad actorshere, and look for Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan insmall roles.The description of this film on the video box likens this to amainstream comedy, and that is a huge mistake. People rentingthis and expecting Airplane! or some Adam Sandler drivel aregoing to be supremely disappointed. This is weird, deep stuff thata lot of people out there will not consider their cup of tea.On the other hand, Rudolph pulls out all the stops, shows us theweird and crazy, then tries to get us to care about the plot. In fact,this film is not a plot driven film, it is character driven, but Rudolphtries to keep this one convention in an otherwise unconventionalfilm.This is truly one of the most bizarre films ever made, right on theline with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Where drugs fueledthe mania in that impossible film, here the mania is caused bysomething we deal with everyday- life. I recommend Breakfast ofChampions.This is rated (R) for physical violence, profanity, strong sexualcontent, sexual references, drug abuse, and adult situations.

Of course, it would be impossible to incorporate all of the odd elements of the novel into a film that is only 2 hours long, but, surprisingly, this movie nails just about all of them. In a hybrid between Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Cadillac Man, this film captivates the audience from the moment Vonnegut's illustrations accent the opening credits to the extremely twisted ending. The entire cast puts on an unbelievable show, especially Bruce Willis, who gives the comedic performance of his lifetime as Dwayne Hoover.

The themes of suburban paranoia and soulless consumerism have motivated some of the best films of the last twelve months, so an inspired interpretation of Breakfast of Champions would have been warmly endorsed.It's clearly been a labour of love for director Alan Rudolph, who has tried for twenty years to make this film. Sadly, twenty years of work appears to have produced one bad draft copy. And Rudolph does not have the slightest grasp on what is funny.Nick Nolte wanders aimlessly around in a dress but it isn't funny. Albert Finney searches out his chaotic literary masterpieces in pornographic magazines but it isn't funny. Barbara Hershey's character is a product of the chaos, but her appearances lack a motive. She isn't required until the film bursts into chaotic life in its last ten minutes.This means three great actors are left stranded. It results in the unlikely event of Bruce Willis stealing the acting honours. He is good, but one feels it would have been no great stretch to act insane.Among the problems here is that the film keeps its feet on the ground. While we're expected to believe the world has gone mad, the actual events are as uninspired as they are unfunny. This doesn't mean it is any easier to understand. In fact, without having read the novel, you'd most likely be lost from the beginning.The chaos of Vonnegut's vision was its real joy. The way characters conspired to come together was inventive. The film though plays like a cliche. The ending is anarchic, but you get the impression it only serves one purpose to stop you making rational sense of the rest of the film. And as much as you want to like it, or applaud Rudolph's commitment, the truth is that BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS is a sad, poor film.

His adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's best (and most scabrous) novel starts with one genius style choice Rudolph mates the Pop Art Expressionism of Oliver Stone with the group-hug ensemble of his mentor, Robert Altman. Beneath the blizzard of smily-face pins, digital-display Colonel Sanders, and chain-diner Muzak lies a Tiffany cast. Bruce Willis is the face of desperation under a stick-on grin as the car-salesman hero, Dwayne Hoover, a small-town hero who doesn't know why he's a few cards short of a full deck. As his second banana, Nick Nolte is a dream as a hard-working joe who's so guilty about his sexual kinks they seem to leak out of him like flopsweat. And as the movie's resident seer and soothsayer--a derelict sci-fi genius named Kilgore Trout--Albert Finney is so perfect Rudolph seems to have plucked him from out of an Iowa City dumpster.Rudolph's attempts at stars-and-stripes Expressionism don't all work; some uncharitable folks will be reminded of late-sixties I-hate-America bashes like END OF THE ROAD. But I have always had a soft spot for those pictures, and I feel protective toward BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS as well. Blessings are showered upon Bruce Willis for scratching this dark-horse project out of thin air, and upon Rudolph too. He must have known that propelling himself out of his usual world of downbeat, canoodling romanticism would pull out of him the best work of his career.

A great cast, a director (Aland Rudolph) who has made several films I've enjoyed (Choose Me, The Moderns, Trouble in Mind). Sadly, BofC is quite a disappointment.Two things really stick out for me. Although Bruce Willis was quite good as Dwayne Hoover, too many of the other characters, notably Harry LeSabre (Nick Nolte) and Wayne Hoobler (Omar Epps) are portrayed in frenetic over the top performances. OK...we get it that there are all sorts of crazies running amuck in Midland City, but the point Vonnegut was making in his novel was that this madness is displayed in the normal everyday way that we live our lives in America. The values (consumerism, greed, violence) and actions that are considered normal in the United States are themselves proof that we are all suffering from a form of madness...showing these fine actors jumping around and uttering indecipherable gibberish shows only that they are annoying.The film also has a problem in creating a consistent point of view. In the novel the author guides us through Dwayne Hoovers' unfolding madness and is actually a character in the book. The movie can't give us the background information the books' narrator did and I would guess that anyone who hasn't read the book will find the movie tough going...perhaps downright incomprehensible.Lastly, as a great fan of Kilgore Trout (Vonnegut fans know him as a character who pops up in several Vonnegut novels) I thought Albert Finney did quite a nice job; he had just the right air of unkempt, curmudgeonly, insane genius that makes Trout my favorite Vonnegut character of all time. Still, it's hardly enough to save this mess...I admire the effort in bringing Breakfast of Champions to the screen, but in the end it's likely that this is an unfilmable novel.

Also, the ending of the book featured the author in the bar, observing his creations just like Trout was in the bar interacting with his creations. I think this is a fairly essential point to the book, but the author was completely left out of this scene in the movie. But overall I enjoyed it.

While the universes created by  Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (and Kilgor Trout) did not usually revolve around Judeo-Christian beliefs, this verse could certainly have been an inspiration for his classic `The Breakfast of Champions.'Captured on film exquisitely, the 1999 movie is a rare jewel. Wonderful direction by Alan Rudolph (who also wrote the screenplay) and a stand-out cast, coupled with the bizarre realities (and lack of same) of Vonnegut's universe, make this not only a hilarious, fast-paced comedy, but a deep and somewhat disturbing one as well.Bruce Willis is Dwayne Hoover, Midland City's leading car salesman. In some 20 years, Dwayne has built up a huge car dealership at `Exit 11 Motor City,' making a fortune and becoming a local celebrity, thanks to his inane wall-to-wall commercials. During the course of this empire building he has also lost his soul - or his identity, at least. With a definite touch of Solomon in his pen, Vonnegut rips into late 20th century American suburbia.Dwayne has everything a modern man is supposed to want - a huge house, with a maid, a nice car, money, respect, recognition, special privileges and a mistress/secretary whom his wife and acquaintances seem to either not notice or to ignore. Yet, does Dewayne have ANYTHING real?Waking up, he opts for suicide, but is interrupted. Thus begins his bizarre `It's a Wonderful Life/Invasion of the Body Snatchers' adventure. Reality is elusion and elusion seems to be reality. Confused enough, Dwayne isn't helped any by the assortment of  problems his friends, family and co-workers are dealing with or hiding from.SPOILERS AHEADDwayne's wife, Celia (Barbara Hershey) is a drugged-out TV-watching zombie, who seems to have trouble differentiating between what she sees on the screen and in real life. Then again, Dwayne is beginning to go through this crisis, himself! Everyone in Midland City likes Dwayne and - what's worse - everyone trusts Dwayne. At least they trust the giant billboard figures of him and television images, grinning reassuringly and promising `You can trust Dwayne Hoover.' But WHY should they trust Dwayne Hoover? And who IS Dwayne Hoover? The more he searches for answers, the more lost and disoriented he becomes.Meanwhile, Dwayne's trusted sales manager, Harry LaSabre (Nick Nolte) is paranoid that Dwayne may find out that he gets off on dressing in women's clothing - despite the reassurances of his spacey, cosmic wife (Vicki Lewis). Francine Pefko, the car dealership's able secretary and Dwayne's not-so-secret mistress, is the closest thing to a well-adjusted person in Dwayne's life - and he becomes convinced (apparently with reason) that she is really after her own KFC franchise. Meanwhile, Dwayne's son, George (Lukas Haas) is working as a club singer, named `Bunny.'While Dwayne tries to hang onto a piece of reality in his rapidly-deteriorating universe, the first annual Midland City Arts Festival is nearing and its founders and benefactors are seeking artists and writers to appear. Elliot Rosewater (who appears in other Vonnegut works), head of the Rosewater Foundation, insists on Kilgor Trout. Trout (Albert Finney) is a down-and-out old hack, whose only published work was bought by a porno magazine company, that paid `diddly squat' and put risqué cover art, having nothing to do with the stories, on the front. Rosewater (Ken Hudson Campbell), however, is his biggest fan, so Trout is invited. Rather than waste the $1,000 honorarium/expense check, Trout starts out hitch-hiking to the festival, bent on showing `those provincials' the downside of the creative spirit. In yet another city, meanwhile, prisoner Wayne Hoobler (Omar Epps) is about to be paroled. Since his name is almost identical to Dwayne's he believes it is his destiny to go to Midland City and work for him.In a bizarre, quick-paced story, Dwayne desperately seeks truth, finally believing that Trout has the answers for him. Although Midland City is still contaminated by oil - probably from the car dealership or other properties owned by Dwayne - and the bizarre happenings of the past days will have to be dealt with, he does find a truth that he can live with in the end.Rudolph's touch is deft and brilliant. This film flows like a rare comedic gem. The strange thing is, most members of the cast are strangers to comedy. Willis turns in absolutely brilliant work as the dazed and befuddled Hoover, while Nolte steals the show. Nolte - normally a tough, foul-mouthed bully, probably turns in his greatest performance as the paranoid, cross-dressing Harry LaSabre.  He and Willis and he and Epps turn in some of the most hilarious celluloid moments in years, neither knowing what the other is talking about and always assuming the worst. Add a clever dialogue and the film never bogs down.Finney is also perfect as the irascible old author, happy to philosophize out loud to his canary, Bill, to drivers who pick him up, or to himself as he hikes along. His world, too, is turned upside down, as the artistic recognition for which he had striven years earlier, is suddenly dumped into his lap, years after he stopped caring.Some symbolism also seems to be at work - although identifying it is another matter. Trout spurns Celia's offer of her galoshes and crosses a burbling, oil slick that may have once been a creek in his bare feet. Later, Dwayne accepts her boots and wades across, insolated from the oil. He survives the film, while the old writer does not. Perhaps Vonnegut is suggesting that one must insolate oneself from the poison and plastic `realities' of everyday life, lest we be consumed by it.Deeper meaning aside, The Breakfast of Champions is an endearing, charming and simply hilarious movie. This is a must-see and a welcome relief from the usual Hollywood clone factory. Perhaps more Vonnegut works need to be turned to film. Breakfast of Champions is just that - a champion.

This accomplishment is largely the result of character development.  And credit for that must be shared with the cast.  Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte and Albert Finny are particularly well cast.  Willis provides a bravo portrayal of a man at the edge, uncertain of his place in the world, neither wacko nor well.  And Nolte's performance as the cross-dressing sales manager alone was worth the price of admission. But Finny was the real bonus.  No complaints here about his rendition of Vonnegut's alter-ego, Kilgore Trout.  From our first view of him talking to his parakeet to that last bittersweet moment in the mirror he breathes life into this literary gem. This was not an easy project to take on.  Let's face it, Vonnegut's 50th birthday present to himself was largely a pretext to pontificate about absurdity in America.  The book doesn't really have a plot. Character development is paraphrased.  Action is described.  It's one thing to merely mention that LaSabre cross-dresses; quite another to produce a cross-dressing Nick Nolte on the screen.

I hope to god that when they finally get around to making a movie of Cat's Cradle that this isn't what becomes of it.

Yes, it is a strange movie but then again, Bruce Willis is someone not afraid to reach, sometimes even beyond his own level as an actor. He certainly reaches here and gives a creditable performance in a very demanding role.That Bruce likes to stretch himself is a good thing and means we have seen him at his best many times throughout his career. He is a self- made actor in many ways, perhaps similarly to George Clooney, he simply refused to not be successful. Contrast with Nicholas Cage - probably a better actor but plays it safe far too often with the result his filmography is the lesser.But back to BoC. Willis is joined by a strong cast, in particular the wonderfully nutty Glenne Headly. Nick Nolte, not my favourite actor, is surprisingly strong as a stressed out salesman. Albert Finney is a strange actor - lots of talent but there doesn't seem to have been any movie that suits him other than Erin Brockovitch.Yes, the movie is less detailed than the original Vonnegut book and this can make it bit spotty when it comes to understanding just exactly what is going on. But in a world of cookie-cutter films, BoC - for better & for worse - is decidedly not just another one.

So, to try and calm my nerves and to possibly see what was in store, I rented the movie 12 Monkeys. As filmmakers go, I trust Terry Gilliam's judgement. But the idea that he cast not only Bruce Willis as the lead, but also the sexiest man in Hollywood (note the sarcasm) as his co-star was a stretch. After watching the film and the 'Making of..' documentary included on the DVD, I must say that I was very impressed with both the way Gilliam presented Willis' character and the way Willis didn't act like Willis.Enter Willis as Hoover Not only does he pull it off--he nails it. Maybe it's the film, maybe it's Willis. Maybe I'm too in love with Vonnegut's story to notice. Whatever it is, I am loving it from the first scene. Willis is simply transformed and within minutes I have completely forgotten about Die Hard or Armageddon. The entire cast delivers strong performances, especially Nolte as Harry LeSabre who, in my book, does a better job here than in Mother Night.Will (die hard) Vonnegut fans, who should take what they can get, enjoy this film? I think so. I know I did. As impossible as it was to imagine Slaughter House 5 being made into a movie, this one was even farther outside the realm of possibilities. But it works. Almost as well as it does in print, only differently.Will people (Americans?) go see it? Will they be touched by Kilgore Trout's description of Now It Can Be Told to the truck driver? I somehow doubt it. But who cares? The minute this sucker comes out on DVD I've got another Vonnegut film adaptation in my arsenal. I'll start by showing it to my friends.

Within the confines of this small world, dealership owner Dwayne Hoover is a celebrity despite the fact that his wealth and success has only served to make him more and more unstable and unhappy. His wife is suicidal and his secretary offers limited relief in their affair. Not that many others have it better. Harry Le Sabre is his sales manager and is full of guilt over his cross dressing and active sex life. With this community breaking down, small time porno-mag article contributor Kilgore Trout makes his way to the city to take his place as the guest of honour at the arts fest &#150; not quite sure how anyone has heard of him.Another commentator on this site has said that if you showed this film to ten people then probably eight would hate it; those praising it have claimed it to be a wonderful version of Vonnegut's novel. Not having read this, I can believe that he (and this) is an acquired taste because I found it to be an almost unbearably messy affair that was delivered in a silly manner that offered little of interest. Indeed for much of the film I wasn't sure what to make of it. Perhaps it tried to do too much but there seemed to be so many characters rammed in here that most of them just seemed out of place and with no development whatsoever. Of course it didn't help that I didn't see much about those given plenty of time either. Dwayne himself is the perfect example of this; his madness seems to have a reason but the film does a terrible job in bringing this out.Rudolph seems passionate in his direction but it seems he is too close to the material and his direction might assume a familiarisation with the material that the mass audience will not have. The delivery is too silly and knowingly manic &#150; it takes away from the material and it left me feeling like perhaps it was my fault for not having read the story before watching it. It annoyed me as well that such a starry cast were mostly wasted &#150; presumably they saw something in the material that did not make it to the screen. Willis tries hard but is not supported at all. Finney spends most of the time in his own film, not really fitting into the narrative. Nolte is amusing; Hershey is wasted; Epps has been told something by the director that the rest of us aren't let into. Patton, Wilson, Haas, Lewis and others provide thankless supports.This may well be perfect for fans of Vonnegut, I cannot say but suffice to say that I am not one of them. However for the casual viewer this is messy, disjointed and pointless to the point of being painful.

Vonnegut's trademark sardonic wit is nowhere to be found.  Instead of Vonnegut's subtlety, instead of his ability to convey both tragedy and comedy in the seemingly mundane, this movie simply throws up all over the viewer continuously in depressed version of Brady Bunch optimism.  Only Kilgore Trout and Harry LeSabre's characters are even remotely close to the novel's intention.  Barbara Hershey is utterly useless and unecessary.Though Bruce Willis delivers a very acceptable performance he is plagued by perhaps the worst writing possible.  From the opening of the film he's a neurotic rampaging idiot.  We never see the transformation of this character.  We never identify with him.  We never feel compasion for him.Not one single character in this movie is believable.  Wayne Hoobler is the worst offender.  From the first moment he appears on-screen the viewer is forced to dismiss him instead of realizing the tragedy of his position.Everything Vonnegut conveys in the novel about American Idealism is never even touched.  Oh sure, they thought they were conveying all this in the film by flooding the viewer with a non-stop acid nitemare of advertisements and such but it's so cliche and forced the viewer can't possibly take it seriously.To the makers of this movie, let me say the following  Vonnegut was never about creating a totally unblievable, bad acid trip, as this movie is.  He was about showing life as it is and showing how absurd and complicated it can be if we just stop and look around a little - how tragic and comedic and in some cases, meaningless it can be.  The book, especially, was about adapting to chaos because order is simply a fantasy so many would like to believe in.To this end, the creators of this film performed the greatest injustice by tacking on the hokiest pokiest pie-in-the-sky ending.  The ending of the book has Vonnegut transcending his characters - throwing out all that is meaningless.  This movie says, in effect, well it's just life, thanks for playing.Kurt Vonnegut now has a novel's worth of material on how ridiculous this movie is.Look, if any of you out there read the book you will realize something. Next time you go to work, or to school or anywhere you will see that there's a lot more beneath the surface of your fellow man tragedy, comedy, heroism, and evil - all us in this world adapting to chaos in the best way we know how.  This movie, on the other hand, is about what happens when you throw up in a blender, turn it on, microwave the contents, bake it for five hours and then film it.It is utter trash.  An insult to everyting Vonnegut.  Another reviewer said it right when he said that Magnolia was a much better translation of Kurt vonnegut's book.  And I thought Slaughter House Five was a failure (although an ambitious failure).Gah!  I can say no more.  It's just too awful.  Even if you just buy the novel and beat yourself over the head with it you will get move Vonnegut than this film could ever hope to deliver.  Even a written apology from the producer and director could not make me feel any sympathy for this film.

The film's general tone is a surreal one, and its satire on media and the business world (where everyone demonstrates a slick and confident veneer but is actually suffering from various hang-ups) is generally interesting and occasionally amusing, but also chaotic and somewhat heavy-handed. A good cast tries hard - Bruce Willis (in yet another attempt at a dramatic role as a man who has everything but sees no point to his life), Albert Finney (as the ageing unappreciated writer, whose work has only ever been published in porn magazines, suddenly exalted to the status of a philosopher) and especially Nick Nolte (as a cross-dressing executive). I seem to recall that this film was barely released and got universally panned by critics at the time but it's hardly a catastrophe; there is also a nicely animated credit sequence and the playful score helps smooth over some of the film's rougher patches.

There are others that you can't.Or to be more precise, there are some authors whose books beg to be made into movies.  Jane Austen;  Louisa May Alcott;  JK Rowling ;)  These authors' books are kind of cinematic in quality already, heavy on visual image, plot and dialogue.  Other authors, however, rely much more on the author's voice, on the wit of the narrator, on internal struggles and internalised monologues that cannot be directly translated into cinema.  Joseph Conrad and Herman Melville are typical of this.  I'm not saying it's impossible to make a film of Moby Dick.  But you'd have to go about it in a really roundabout kind of way, not run at it head on like you might with a movie of Pride and Prejudice.  Perhaps the best example of how to make a film out of of such writers is Apocalypse Now.Kurt Vonnegut belongs very much to that second, difficult, school of writers.  OK, so you want to make a movie out of Vonnegut, fine.  But it requires a screenplay of at least something approaching equal genius to the original book to adapt his books for the screen.  I'm sorry to say that on this occasion Alan Rudolph has come up sorely lacking.  His approach is too literal  he focuses too strongly on the plot and dialogue of the original, which is very much the least brilliant part of the novel, the vehicle for (rather than the instrument of) the novel's humour, satire and wit.  Rudolph simply doesn't try hard enough to convert what's important to the novel, it's *sense* actually, its essence, to his chose medium.  By way of a metaphor - if Rudolph is trying to recreate an apple, it looks great and feels right but it tastes terrible.The actors, to a man, give wonderful performances.  Bruce Willis unhinges magnificently, Nick Nolte's eccentricities will live in the memory, Albert Finney has never been anything short of outstanding in anything.  And so, moments of this movie are profoundly memorable, thoroughly watchable, deeply interesting.  But it's not enough.  It doesn't make a movie.  I saw the movie before I read the book, before I even knew there was a book called Breakfast of Champions, and frankly I didn't entirely understand what was going on all the time.  Ultimately, for all the great acting and the fantastic raw material this movie was based on, this film is a failure.  A moderately incomprehensible travesty.  A wasted opportunity.  And it is the adapter, who also directed, who is to blame.  I suggest he stick to directing, since he does that well, and leave the adapting to somebody with more ability and knowledge in that area.All that having been said, however, this movie still has a lot more going for it than 90% of the cack that churns out of Hollywood every year.  So 4/10 is misleading as an average score when you consider that the current drossbuster, 2Fast2Furious, is currently scoring 5.  At least this film is memorable...

This big-screen effort requires the viewer to have an equally extensive familiarity with Vonnegut's works, not just in order to fully enjoy it, but to make any sense out of it whatsoever.The video box attempts to portray Breakfast of Champions as some sort of quirky, offbeat comedy, but in fact it's as frustratingly incoherent as it is relentlessly unfunny. Shame, considering the novel's mesmerizing lattice of coincidence, paranoia and hilarious satire. Of course, I was in college when I first read it, and at the time generally in a chemically-induced haze. The (few) people who enjoy this adaptation seem to be in similar states of mind.Anyone who hasn't read the book will likely see Breakfast of Champions as a sad attempt to make a wacky, surreal farce in the gonzo vein of Fear and Loathing.

The acting wasn't really all that bad, and Bruce Willis was actually pretty good in the lead role. But three of the main role, Harry Le Sabre (Nick Nolte), Wayne Hoobler (Omar Epps), and Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney) are written entirely wrong. We are meant to see something of ourselves in these characters, when instead we saw what is almost animation.This is the whole problem with the movie. The material is treated almost as a comedy (look at the category it's listed under), which it is most certainly not. Between Epps bouncing around like an idiot, Nolte mumbling through 3/4 of his line, and Finney portraying Trout all wrong (there's supposed to be a quiet dignity to him which is missing until the end), this movie just misses on all cylinders.As an interesting side note, Michael Clarke Duncan of Green Mile fame has a cameo here as a prisoner - it may be the only role he's ever played where his character isn't revealed to have a sweet personality under a gruff exterior.

The book ended with the rampage, with no resolution. The last word of the book is etc! However, in order to make this story more Hollywood, they tacked on this sappy resolution of all problems and a reuniting of a fractured family. It was not fitting (in the book his wife had committed suicide years ago by swallowing Drano -- thus giving meaning to Francine's otherwise inexplicable apology for the comment, Some people will swallow anything) or even necessary; in fact, it left the view wonder what had just happened.In another example, the book scathingly dealt with racism throughout society. This was completely glossed over in the movie. Dwayne Hoobler had been a tragic character, an example of racism's effect on an innocent dreamer, not the annoying, ridiculous bouncing idiot played by Omar Epps.Lastly, I doubt that anyone would have known what the heck the screenplay meant when it referred to Goodbye, Blue Monday, which was Vonnegut's take on ridiculous advertising and technology's promise to change our lives when the movie introduced the phrase, even I was wondering, Did I miss something?

The first book I read upon my reintroduction was Breakfast of Champions.  As I read it, I knew in the back of my mind that it had been made into a film by the unforgivably inscrutable and self-indulgent director Alan Rudolph (who is married to Theresa Russell, the only actress that has ever made Denise Richards look like some kind of human being).  It was the dream, apparently, of Bruce Willis to bring the novel to the big screen and it is proof, as if proof were needed, that Vonnegut is, indeed, unfilmable. I have thought that other authors were unfilmable and I have been proven wrong (Ellroy's L.A. Confidential comes to mind) - I do not foresee a time, however, when Vonnegut's left-wing adolescent politics and magical realism will ever be transferred successfully to the big-screen without a surplus of schmaltz and sentimentality.  No matter how juvenile the philosophies of Vonnegut ultimately reveal themselves to be, his prose is sublime and is the enduring reason that he has occupied a place in the modern canon. Although I find his bleeding heart to be a messy thing, he is compulsively readable and a brilliant structuralist.The film (and, to an extent, the novel) is about a car salesman, Dwayne Hoover (Willis) who is going insane and the meeting between he and an underappreciated science fiction author named Kilgore Trout that results in Hoover going on a murderous rampage.  Vonnegut, in the novel, insinuates himself into the book - breaking down the fourth wall of the book like some French absurdist playwright.  It is a brilliant conceit and one that I was looking forward to in the film.  The way that this is handled is among the most disappointing things about the film.I began to realize that it was perhaps unwise to repeatedly refer to the book - understanding that many in the audience had probably never read the book.  Without the book as a guide, however, the film is a nonsensical stream of consciousness piece that is, because it's directed by Alan Rudolph, self indulgent and inscrutable.  You can call the attempt a noble one, but Breakfast of Champions descends into a sort of maudlin escapade of cheap sentimentality and surprisingly unsatisfying resolutions.  By the end, it resembles nothing more than a particularly confusing after school special espousing the merits of living life for the moment, appreciating your family (the wife, long dead in the book, is brought back to life in the form of the soporific Barbara Hershey), and embracing the joy of entropy.As far as I can tell, and I've looked into it, the two and half hours spent watching this film are completely unrecoverable.

I think the problem that most filmmakers have is that they try to reinvision his work and this always leads to failure. This is the case with Breakfast of Champions a movie that veers so far of the course that you wonder if anyone involved read the book The casting is perfect, Bruce Willis and Albert Finney as Dwayne Hoover and Kilgore Trout are dead on perfect but all the whimsey and humor are gone this is suppose to be a story of two men on an journey but this film just turns it into a bad comedy about a used car salesmen *Spoiler and correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Dwaynes wife being dead a huge plot point in the book, and here she's alive and kicking whats that all about my advise to all filmmakers attempting to do Vonnegut, or any novel, Respect the source material "},{"Title":"What the hell!","Date":"18 February 2003","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I know when a movie stinks, but this one hit me in the face like the smell of bad cheese!

The book was good.  This movie is not good. It is bad.I realize that this book is a very complicated thing and probably shouldn't be on film anyway because it is very non-linear.  The book makes digressions and gives background on people and events in the past while the story in the present is happening.  It would be difficult to do that on film.  This movie didn't even try. First of all, this movie wasn't funny.  I can't remember laughing at all.According to the book, Dwane Hoover's wife was supposed to have committed suicide a long time ago.  In the movie, she is alive (yet still suicidal). And they should have had more about Dwayne going nuts (i.e. seeing the giant duck).  And the bit with Kilgore Trout and trying to enter the other dimension was just stupid.  And don't even get me started on the ending.  I liked the end of the book.  The ending of this movie was terrible.  Maybe it's because I've read the book, and I just assumed that a film maker would e nice enough to stick to the story of the book his/her movie is based on.Bruce Willis did a pretty good job, so did Albert Finney.  Nick Nolte was okay.  The rest weren't all that good.I think it would have been very possible to stick almost exactly to the book and take a more fast-paced non-linear tone, rather than go off on some stupid shallow oversentimental tangent.  They even could have had an omniscient filmmaker character, the Creator, be a character in the movie. He could introduce the movie, narrate it, and be in it, like in the book.Maybe it's just because I expected more because I've read the book.  If you've read the book, don't see the movie because you'll be wasting your time.  I'm sorry, but it just annoyed me something awful.

Many of 'Fear & Loathing's problems in bringing the story to the screen could be solved by high-tech special effects; 'Breakfast of Champion's challenges are much more subtle and especially sensitive to context.  It was a big mistake not to keep this a period piece, but rather set it in the present day.  Much of the power of the novel is in the skewering of racism and nationalism found in the extremely sharp satirical tone.  Unfortunately, in these overly sensitive 'politically correct' times, translating these to film would be very difficult.  'Fear & Loathing' also suffered here  one of my favorite lines was the Latino lawyer's ultimate insult  'You cheap honky faggot!  In films, that just doesn't fly nowadays, I guess....

The novel gave a very basic story, easy to follow (if many of the authors thoughts were cut out), with spots for great visuals and wonderfully developed characters. So what EXACTLY was Alan Rudolph thinking when he made this film?! He completely butchered Vonnegut's story, turning it into an unwatchable piece of junk, completely devoid of all it's original meaning... I could name the problems with the script, but there are far too many...But I have to say, the very worst thing about this film was casting Albert Finney as Kilgore Trout. I have nothing against Finney, but there was no possible way of him portraying Trout the way the character was written... in fact, I think the only man who could really play Trout perfectly would be Vonnegut himself. But Finney was way off.Though the film did have one or two good points, for example, Willis as Dwayne Hoover, and his interactions with Nolte as Le Sabre, overall this movie was an incredible disappointment to the novel and should have been much better.3/10  "}{"Title":"Pure Dreck","Date":"27 March 2000","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I rented this movie on the strength of the cast, i.e. Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte and Barbara Hershey.  With such established actors, how bad could it be?  Answer Absymal.  It is very rare that I come across a movie that has no redeeming value whatever.  `Breakfast of Champions' is such a movie.  If this is typical of Kurt Vonnegut's writing, then I am fortunate to have missed his work.  This screenplay was inane, insipid, absurd and farcical, all while somehow being woefully unfunny.  To attempt to describe the plot would be like waking from a confusing bad dream and trying to describe the disconnected and bizarre events to your dog.  To try to find meaning in this story would be a validation of one's own insanity.There was a lot of good talent wasted here.  Nick Nolte was reduced to a blithering idiot, a real setback for what I consider a talented dramatic actor.  Bruce Willis, who has the range to tackle an intelligent comedic role, is simply all wrong for this type of harebrained part.  This is more Robin Williams' or Jim Carrey's style of fatuousness.   The only correctly cast actor other than Glenne Headly was Albert Finney, who did a fine job of playing the eccentric Gilgore Trout (OK, I found some redeeming value, but not enough to hold my lunch).  The camera work was awful.  There was an abundance of weird shots, overuse of extreme close-ups, poor angles, wide angles, strange lighting, etc.  The only thing I can say about the direction was it was consistent with the content of the script&#133;dreadful.I have rated close to 500 films on IMDb and I have never given a film a 1/10&#133;until now.
