I don't intend to give too much away, as the power of the film lies in it's mystery, but I will say that this movie could almost be classified as disturbing, not due to its content, but rather the thoughts that it instills in the audience. I found myself rather shaken as I left the cinema, feeling as though I had been exposed to an ugly, hidden side of humanity and society. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely worth seeing, I would even be so bold as to say that it must be seen!

The rest of the cast is fantastic as well.The neat thing about this movie is that the makers did it for relatively cheap (only having to make one set, that they constantly reconfigured) yet, the film works on many levels.

It all comes down to human emotions and confrontations that get in the way of progress.  It's a talky film, but that's the point-- figuring situations and dealing with different personalities is inevitable to any group.  The solving of problems becomes very complex, but the viewer doesn't have to worry...let the characters figure it out as we go along for the ride.  While so many sci-fi films want to wow you with effects, this film does something more challenging--it makes you think.  With its limited budget and digital effects in use even before Titanic glorified them, Cube still proves itself as one of the more original and intelligent sci-fi films of the last decade, with a cult status already going strong.

Another shining example of how my inadequacy in mathematics could be the end of me. I used to skip math class. I took the bare minimum requirement expected of me and passed with something less than flying colours. The point is, math is all that separates our heroes from certain death in this arena.Cube is an innovative little thriller that can safely dodge accusations of blandness or mediocrity. The premise is simple and the plight of the characters is highly relative despite its surrealistic science fiction setting. Six individuals find themselves trapped in a cube comprised of many rooms linked together, with no readily visible way out, no rations, tools or explanation for being there, with traps set up in some of the rooms. An apparent experiment on how people think and react to certain situations and the transformations they might undergo.The simplicity of the film and the cube itself are the film's strongest assets and can probably account for it's international success, notably in Japan. It's low budget production costs came under $400,000. But they got a really good bang for their buck with some help from special effects houses that provided their services free of charge. As the director has commented on the audio commentary track of the DVD, one aspect they were going for was a way to have an action flick in one room. They pulled it off quite nicely. Another interesting tidbit brought to light was that each character's name is after a prison.A curious aspect of this Canadian film was its surprisingly short run in Canadian cinemas. In speaking with one of the film's producers, Mehra Meh, I learned that despite it's award as Best First Feature at the Toronto Film Festival of 1997, the film run in Canada came a year later and was just for a few short weeks before it was yanked from theaters and then showcased internationally. When time came for the DVD release, I found another perplexing development. It was only available as an import. A Canadian film only available as an import in Canada? It wasn't until months later that it was released domestically.In any case, the film is available now and worth checking out if you have interest in the psychological thriller fare. Those who work their days or nights (or both) in a cubicle may wish to pass on this one, as it just might be too close to home.

The Cube is a superbly crafted low budget film. On a shoestring budget and a dangerously basic premise full of intrigue, the film succeeds because of imaginative effects and taut directions as well as a superbly written script, delving into the human psyche in such an extreme situation.

The rooms are numbered and the numbers could signify the type of room but also a map. The film is excellent and just when they think they have figured it out the Cube bites them in the behind. The dynamic of the characters is excellent as inevitably some go crazy. I do think that for a film shot for less than 300,000 dollars this is amazing looking. It works well for a film that is set in the same environment for the 90 minutes of the film.

All of those movies are rated PG-13 and can't seem to scare anyone. But right at the verge of these so-called horror movies came Cube, a low-budget horror film with an original idea and a good idea of how to execute it. It could have gone belly-up, but it works for the most part and creates a suspenseful movie.A group of seven people find themselves trapped in some sort of maze of cubes. They're all different colors and to make matters more interesting, some are booby trapped. They have no recollection of how they got there, nor do they have a clue how to get out. It becomes a battle of wits to stay sane and survive.There's an overall sense of creepiness, doom, and claustrophobia that overshadows the whole movie, not to mention the paranoia that sinks into both the characters and you as you watch. You only know as much as the characters-you don't know how they got into the cubes, what they're for, or any of the typical exposition. And although most of the characters were annoying, it put you side by side with them, which helped a lot. If you get to be next to the characters, you can understand their actions more. However, you do (somewhat) find out what these cubes were made for, which kind of dampers the whole thing, but it's still very interesting to go through.But when the climax comes about, the movie descends into hokey B-horror land, with a terrorized killer stalking most of the people. When the original exploration of the cubes subsides and you get the people walking around, also, the interest starts to wane. It's often repetitive, but the booby traps are quite, for lack of a better word, fun. But that doesn't mean that the original creativity has gone away, it's just not as interesting. But I really liked Cube, and if you see it, you will too.My rating 7/10Rated R for some strong sci-fi violence/gore and language.

Here's what I said to her...------------------------------------------------------------------------The left hand didn't know what the right was doing as Worth put it. The Cube was something that never should've been built but it was.Worth says, There is no conspiracy. Nobody is in charge. It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan.He also says,This is an accident, a forgotten, perpetual public works project. You think anybody wants to ask questions? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck.I think one of the most important lines in the film is from Rennes (the escape artist) who says, No more talking. No more guessing. Don't even think about nothing that's not right in front of you. That's the real challenge. You've gotta save yourselves from yourselves.He couldn't have been more right.The end of the film and who makes it out was a lesson on social breakdown. The Cube should never have been built but when it was, the people who created it realized what they had done and simply decided to make use of it rather than let it sit unused. They put people in it.So in a way it doesn't have a greater purpose...but yet it does....in the lessons learned by watching the characters inside of it. The Cube is just a gigantic empty device until you add that human element to it. That's where the real fun begins and that's what makes it interesting.Quentin (the evil cop) was pretty accurate when he said,This place is... remember Scaramanga? The bad guy in The Man With The Golden Gun? It's some rich psycho's entertainment.And in a way he was right. The Cube really doesn't serve any purpose but to provide its creators with a sick form of entertainment.Cube, above all is a fantastic multi-character study combined with sci-fi elements. One of the reasons I like it is because at it's core, it is very simple...but yet it is also very complex at the same time. Kind of like a Rubik's cube. Sitting on someone's desk collecting dust, a Rubik's cube will simply sit there...it has no purpose. But when a human picks it up and starts turning and twisting it....well you get the idea. I wouldn't be surprised if the Rubik's cube was the inspiration for the writers to write Cube.Hopefully this helps.

After a long time, I finally got around to seeing this interesting looking film today.Deeply mysterious, Cube chronicles the story of seven different people as they travel through an apparently endless system of interlinked cube structures with six doors each to adjacent cubes. Relying on each others' individual characteristics and skills to get them through, they desperately attempt to escape their geometric hell.With a single claustrophobic set used for shooting , one undeniable thing about Cube is the originality of its premise. Reworking the concept of the maze thriller in all sorts of new dimensions, it brings an interesting newness to the subgenre. The potential presented in the early scenes of the film is large; the opening scene immensely entertaining and indicative of good things to come from the original and intriguing concept. The implementation of this idea is, however, cripplingly flawed. Suffering painfully all the faults of clunky and unrealistic dialogue, the film does little to improve it with some substandard performances. The characters, though mildly interesting, seem to react in entirely absurd ways at times, doing much to detract from the audience sympathy vote Kazan, an autistic character, is often just offensively portrayed; Leaven, the math whiz, takes her time in trying to decide if multiples of 5 and 2 are prime numbers. The film is full of holes and massive flaws, turning it from a film of considerable potential to, at times, an infuriatingly contrived work. All that aside, it is actually quite enjoyable once you accept and expect its regular absurdity. Plot twists are painfully obvious, but the path to them is at least a fun one to tread, some of the tensions rising between characters interesting, if not effective or believable. Though it does little to establish itself as a particularly good movie, it's at least not a terrible one.With flaws aplenty, many of them just silly and stupid, Cube falls flat on its face more than once, suffering regularly from its less than convincing dialogue and unintentionally funny developments. Entertaining all the same, it's certainly original.

The only other death caused by the rooms was a spurt of acid that miraculously landed right on the guys face. Sadly, the sweetness of the room effects was overshadowed by the atrocious acting and even more pathetic dialogue. Perhaps the saddest part of the movie was its attempt to incorporate mathematics. This could've been one of the best parts of the film if they'd decided to have even a single mathematician proofread the script. Using the words 'prime' 'factor' and 'cartesian' doesn't make it mathematically profound or philosophical, or correct. Nor does mentioning Descartes' name. As the girl proved, wearing glasses does not make you a math genius. They were all terrible actors, but the doctor was so comically bad I couldn't help rooting for the psychopathic cop who dropped her off the edge. Was he supposed to be hero? But if they'd only stayed in the room, they wouldn't have been driven mad and perhaps the cop never would've lost his mind and killed all the people...are you serious? And the annoying autistic man is the only one to make it out? What? No matter what way you try to justify the characters motives they're all idiotic. If you have even a semblance of logic this movie will not make any sense. What would be sweet is if this movie were remade in 5-10 years with a decent script, some people who can act, and at least one profound mathematical concept. I swear, real ones do exist.

They try to get out.It isn't really about the prison, though. It's about how people react to stress. And it's about the design of the prison.The basic premise reads like a Twilight-Zone episode. 6 people wake up in a series of interconnected rooms. Some of these rooms kill their occupants in various ways.Each person was placed there with a specific function in mind. One person is a cop, who has leadership qualities. One is a doctor, able to treat the wounded. One is a high-school student, who's math knowledge is still fresh in her mind. One is one of the people who built a component of the place, who brings unique knowledge of the prison. One is apparently autistic, able to perform complex math computations easily. One is an escape artist loner-type who gets himself killed early on to remind the audience that anyone can die.The prison acts as a personality-conflict engine, as it forces people to interact to save each other's lives and their own.It's a great premise, the interlocking prison that they have to figure out the secrets to. And, as with any human endeavor, dealing with each other becomes increasingly hard as dehydration and stress wear down their patience.The problem comes when one of them, quite suddenly, snaps and starts killing them. For no apparent reason.I understand that tensions were running high. But when the most likable and reasonable character in the entire movie starts going nuts and killing people for no apparent reason, it kinda sullies the character interactions.Granted, this was a problem with the dialog as a whole. People thrust into the situation seemed entirely too unwilling to tell each other things. I can understand panic. But after an hour in the death maze, when someone asks what skills you could contribute, I would expect people to give a full resume/CV including personal histories, not, I'm a doctor, like 10 million others. There was a lot of confrontation in the movie, even at the beginning when dehydration and exhaustion hadn't set in yet.

I thought `Scary Movie' was a really clever goof on its viewers.This film pleasantly surprises. It is unremarkable in most of the normal respects the cinematography and most acting is pedestrian. The directing and editing is poor. So where's the reward?The conception is brilliant. The sets are Shakespearian, with no props, essentially no costumes. In fact, essentially the whole film is in ostensibly different, but identical small rooms. It is all pure drama which hinges less on what you see, instead the situation that is created by dialog. The center of this film is built in your imagination, on incomplete fragments rattling around in there -- paranoid fragments about the nature of fate, trust and a society allied against you.What really appeals to me is how much sense this world makes. The design of the maze makes great sense; the mathematics is accessible and correct (not like `Pi' or `Omega Code'), as is the visual notion of the rooms moving. The logic of the physical space contrasts with the total ignorance about who created this situation and why. Since the cinematic vocabulary is made so clear, the angst about the outside society is made more acute.I think the basic notion works a whole lot better than, say the second `Alien' or the first `Die Hard,' both of which are basically escape movies leavened by `Ship of Fools.'This is a likely target for a remake with a better budget, a much better candidate than, say `The Professional.' Imagine if these folks had the money and creative talent of the disastrous `The Cell.' If this was remade, though, the extra money need not go into more elaborate sets. The sparceness of the sets is part of its strength. Instead, the money needs to go into script dialog, better actors (but deBoer isn't bad), a real score, and some competent cinematography. This would be a natural for a real artist.As it is, it is still worth viewing. Think of it as slightly illustrated radio. Seen this way, it is worthy of a young Welles.

Because it relies on the story and the quality of acting to make it great, not C.G.I. and overpaid mainstream actors. Not only is it a well presented thriller, it's also a study of the breakdown of human emotions and sanity when kept in solitude outside of one's comfort zone. The cube tests the characters' ability to function and work together in alien territory while in constant imminent danger. This is just a brilliant film made by a brilliant writer/director.

That said, the dialogue and performances are brutal at times and that's largely what weakens the film for me these days. The film relies on the strength of its characters and their interaction with each other to draw us into the plot, and no one here is really up to the challenge. Also, there are too many weird, distracting details like the plastic button that can scratch metal. It's certainly not a bad film by any means, but its flaws are too glaring for it to fully succeed.

Soon he is joined by other people, strangers, who also have no idea where they are. Looking around they find that each room leads to another one that looks just the same. One of the group is the famous prison escape artist Rennes, who realises that some of the rooms are booby-trapped but that he thinks he has got the solution. With no other ideas the group follow him and try to evade the traps and stay alive &#150; all the time with absolutely no idea of why they are here or who has imprisoned them.I heard about this film years ago but only recently managed to find it on television to watch. It is hard to think that it is almost a decade old now but that it is still effective and a regular cult movie that people will still talk about. Its power is in its simplicity &#150; every room is the same and every next room could be safe or could be a trap; there is no reason for any of it and there appears to be no way out. Usually this sort of stuff makes for a great pitch but not always a good movie because the idea can't stretch beyond a catchy gimmick, however here it does it and makes it look easy. The whole film is our characters trying to work their way through the rooms without getting horribly killed. This in itself is gripping and at times unbearable to watch &#150; horror fans may be disappointed that long periods go by without a lot of gore but personally I prefer tension to the delivery.At the same time we also get the characters feeding the mystery of the cube, building the tension and the sense of hopelessness without ever really solving anything. It answers questions with more questions and keeps things moving well. The development of the characters is better than I expected and I liked the way that the film played with the characters, changing them as the film went along. It isn't a fantastic character piece but again it is just something that helps keep the film moving and I suppose it was interesting to see the nature of people come out. In that regard I was also impressed by the cast. I had expected poor performances from a low budget film but actually they were all quite good. Wint is best but towards the end his performance became a bit too simplistic. Hewlett underplays and probably has the least character to deal with but is still good. De Boer was effective and interesting. Robson was a nice distraction. Guadagni was a good counterweight for Wint and played well to develop him and herself at the same time. Miller was good and the pace of the film helped distract from him basically doing a Rain Man impression.Overall an impressive low budget thriller that works because it sticks to the simple idea while building side issues with the characters and the cube around it but never actually solving anything. Perhaps it is better not to over praise it because I thought it was at its best because I didn't know what was going to happen.

This sure is true, because one has to be insane to take a movie with such a bizarre and contrived setting at face value.And of course it's a metaphor. At least it's what the creators of Cube wanted to think they were making. When you do something utterly unrealistic and make your characters behave in the most unlikely and unnatural way imaginable, you must believe you're conveying some sort of a message via those acts.Unfortunately, the director and the screenwriter seem to forget what a metaphor is. Metaphor is a second layer, concealed and subtle, of anything that is still rather believable, albeit shallow, on the surface. You can't simply blurt out some message you consider important out of the blue and think it adds artistic value to your product. But here, this is exactly what happens. If the movie wants to make an allegory of society as a giant machine in which people are just little cogs, it does no more than just make one of the characters say something like we're nothing but cogs spinning in this huge machine. If it wants to claim that life is a headless beast with no mastermind but human stupidity, it also bluntly says it out loud. That's not a metaphor, and it's definitely not art. It's just ravings of a madman, which can be enlightening to some who are desperate to find a hidden meaning in everything, but are still more or less a pointless nonsense if observed on a long run.But the script is not the only weak point of this movie. The acting which starts as just blah, goes to laughable to hysterical to preposterous. Obviously, in a movie that views itself as a naked metaphor, the characters are all but walking archetypes, but, with the delirious approach the film has taken, they are hardly more than caricatures of the types they were supposed to enact. And that is really sad, because no matter how much promise your idea shows, when it's delivered that bad one is only left to shrug and wonder on what drugs the film makers were.Still, Cube undeniably has at least one true virtue. Which is to be an example for the new and aspiring cinema artists of what can happen when you take a promising premise and screw it up with a bland and uninspiring implementation.

This one  is very much a play on Sarte's Huis clos (L'enfer, c'est les autres - Hell is the other people) infused with thriller and sometimes basic horror overtones. The scenario seems to have been written by a philosopher and a mathematician, and the ending seems to enter religious parable territory (Happy are  the feeble-minded). I thought the pretty thin premise would wear thin after an exciting first half-hour, but the movie never lets  go, helped by a very strong cast. Sometimes, there are artificial or too obvious ways to highten the tension (Like killing first the prisoner who seems the most likely to survive and a sudden incursion in Friday the 13th territory, etc) but this is understandable for a first effort and gives some naive,  passionate flavor to the proceedings, compared to  computer-generated Hollywoodian scenarios.

We never do find out how this assortment of characters get into the cube in the first place. However, by chance we have a young lady who is a math and geometry genius, man who is an idiot savant and able to factor very large numbers just by looking at them, and the designer of the outer shell of the cube. And those talents, in concert, are the key to finding a way out of the cube. If, as the designer says, it is a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan, then the coincidence would be too great to be credible.  This film doesn't purport to be a fantasy, like Matrix or Pleasantville, so we are left to assume it attempts to represent a possible reality.  It doesn't work.Still, there are some moments of tension, as they try to survive and travel from cube to cube, hoping to find a way out. My favorite was when they found the blue room with traps activated by sound. So everything became silent as each in turn worked his or her way to the opposite door.  I was even afraid to make a noise. The key, of course, comes when they figure out the the 17,576 cubes (26 on each edge) are moving relative to each other, and they get into the only one which will have a bridge to the outside.  Only the idiot savant escapes, as the others are either killed or otherwise incapacitated. I think the film ultimately fails on two levels. First, we aren't able to have empathy for any of the characters. Second, although the premise is interesting, the writer and director had no meaningful way to pull everything into any kind of satisfying conclusion. Coming up with an idea is easy, all of us can do that, but to wrap up the story is a whole different complexity and, unfortunately, far too few professional filmmakers are up to the task.

That humans are trapped in a maze of impersonal technology seems too obvious. I suppose viewers are expected to define for themselves the film's thematic import. Otherwise, the plot just seems to go round and round in a circle, then stops.A low-budget sci-fi film, Cube could easily be converted into a stage play. I didn't especially care for it.

You've gotta save yourselves from yourselves.Shot in only 20 days with a hand-held camera in a single 14'x14' cubical set and a very low budget, this minimalist Canadian sci-fi horror film has become a cult favorite for many. Directed in 1997 by Vincenzo Natali, this was his first feature film and it still remains as one of his most popular ones, although Splice has also been warmly received by critics and seen by many more people thanks to its much bigger budget. He's also directed several TV series, including Hannibal which in my opinion stands out for its cinematography. Natali also co-wrote this original script with Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson (creator and producer of another hit series, Orphan Black). For its minimalist approach, Cube does manage to stand out and deliver several thrills along the way, but five minutes into the movie I feared I knew what direction the story was heading, and unfortunately it did, so it was a bit of a letdown. However the journey was quite a pleasant and gripping one, so the movie did flow at a strong pace and I was engaged with it original premise.The film begins with a man (Julian Richings) waking up inside a cube-shaped room without any recollection as to how he got there. There is one door on every side of the cube, leading to other same shaped rooms although with different colors. According to the suit he's wearing his name is Alderson. As he leaves one of the rooms and enters a new one he is sliced into small pieces by a trap consisting of thin wires. We later discover that there are more people in the cube when a small group of them find each other in one room. A police officer named Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), an architect named Worth (David Hewlett), a doctor named Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), an escape artist named Rennes (Wayne Robson), and a mathematician named Leaven (Nicole de Boer) all seem to have woken up in the same condition as Alderson and they are fighting their way through this maze trying to avoid the traps hidden in some of the rooms. They seem to have nothing in common as their personalities completely differ from one another, and they have no idea who could've put them in such a place. They do decide to stick together and try using their different talents to avoid the deadly traps as they move along through the maze looking for an escape. As the story unfolds and these characters begin interacting with one another tension and suspicion begin to rise among them. David Hewlett who has worked with Vincenzo Natali in all his feature films gets one of the lead roles here along with Maurice Dean Wint and Nicole de Boer. The performances in this film are the weakest link. Some of the dialogue scenes seemed forced and most of the characters' interactions felt unauthentic. The greatest problem was that most of these characters behaved in an inconsistent manner and the pressure they go through isn't a convincing reason for it. Quentin's character is the one who goes through the strongest transformation here and I just didn't feel it was natural. Other than the performances and the predictable finale, I did enjoy this small film and found the premise quite inventive despite its simplicity. With a stronger cast this could've been a great sci-fi horror film because Natali excels at setting the right atmosphere which creates a thrilling environment. The mood of this film reminded me a lot of Saw and I'm sure it was inspired by Natali's work. http//estebueno10.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Has a lot of unused potential...","Date":"7 June 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Cube is a movie that apparently has a cult following out there.

Also some of the kills were pretty awesome and original, so that's always good to have in a horror film. However, I do believe the movie does get more things wrong than right the acting is pretty terrible and the dialog clichéd. Also sometimes it seems the writers rushed into getting the characters into certain situations too quickly, which creates some pretty weird and uncomfortable dialog. Another thing the movie does wrong is how they handle the moving through the maze and it gets way too brainy and illogical at the same time and it copies Rain Man. It does. The ending where the crazy black guy kills two of the other characters is also pretty unrealistic. I mean, how the hell didn't they hear him get in the same room as them? It was established several times during the movie that the doors are extremely freaking' loud when they open and close. By the way that guy's situation escalated pretty quickly he went from being the hero to Jack Torrance in like nothing. I have to say I did enjoy some of Cube and yeah Saw may be kind of a rip-off of this, but Saw executes its ideas way better than this.

They are trying to find their way out through the giant labyrinth of traps, riddles and twists which would make the makers of Saw jealous. The cube maze the characters are in represents this movie Twisty, dense, complex and pretty darn confusing. This is a critically ignored movie which later gained a cult following and deservedly so. Like many B movies, it starts out shaky. Its characters leave you cold and it keeps repeating itself. It also has its various detours into generic B movie clichés which weaken the film and it goes from set piece to set piece without ever delivering a knockout punch. However, the film improves as it progresses. The characters become more developed, different layers are revealed and information is revealed in a structured and clever way. The set pieces get more and more heart in mouth and ultimately Cube gets as much as it can out of its generic but brilliant premise.A mature decision was to leave much of what goes on ambiguous and the film thankfully doesn't have a major reliance on gore. It does get rather claustrophobic although after a while we get used to the setting. Cube is one of those movies where you're in the trap for the whole thing, and no sighting of the outside world means it feels a bit more artificial but this adds to the tension at the same time. The acting improves as the film goes on and although the cast still seem to be unknown, they do a good job. The director doesn't seem to be too prolific which is a shame as there's clearly plenty of talent here. The script doesn't do anything special but it tells the story decently and spits out the many twists with admirable effort. Cube is not a great movie but it is a very interesting one and a likable albeit sadly obscure effort. If you ever get bored of watching Saw, this would definitely be a good alternative and it's good for anyone who likes puzzles. I doubt you'll be able to solve the puzzle in this movie though.7/10 "},{"Title":"Fascinating, but with a smart-ass and silly ending","Date":"17 August 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" I found this film gripping and fascinating.A mystery and clues that emerge along the route.You see the dynamics of the group and how it evolves.How do people behave under pressure?

A group of strangers awaken with no memory of how they became trapped. They need to find a way out - except some rooms are booby-trapped. Tension, conflict and madness ensues.Some have remarked upon the acting quality in the film, although I rather enjoyed the larger-than-life reactions of the characters. The film unashamedly embraces its own B-movie silliness. As the post-Saw horror genre has seemingly become a contest of escalating cruelty and gross-out money shots, a film whose thrills rely on inventive camera angles, imaginative narrative twists, and scarily unpredictable character mood swings seems almost quaint. But it works, thanks to its devotion to the puzzle at its heart and the descending psychology of those trying to solve it.The production design is simple (Natali's team built one cube and changed the wall colour to represent different rooms) and the make-up is effectively gruesome. It's the kind of movie where you'll be constantly questioning character motivations, but surrender to the ride and you'll find yourself enjoying a very neat cult gem.

One a Doctor, another a Cop. And a math wizard who seems to know how the cube functions for traps. But that is a one sided coin. During the groups travels through the cube they come across a savant. Now the fight to survive becomes even more desperate when the group begins to break down the moral barrier. Frustrations and anger fuel each member as they all come closer to the exit. Yet one member had the knowledge because he was the creator for the outer shell. Now as the race quickens, the cop loses his cool, murders and tries to take revenge for the group leaving him behind. Through this, the savant has a miraculous gift to see numbers to lead the less vicious part of the group to the exit itself. A cube, A bridge, and an exit makes this film more than worth watching, it has psychological aspects to delve into the mind, it has action of each trap which harbour the most cruel and gross ways to die.

The characters are very stereotypical though, which is ok up to a point.  The movie loses its credibility with the addition of a token, straight off the shelf, 2 dimensial autistic boy who, of course, is able to supply the final mathematical solution.The ending is, unfortunately, entirely predictable after the first few interactions of the characters and when it comes its very dissatisfying.

I really am not sure why it's getting such good reviews. Yes it's basic premise has an element of interest to it and it's not bad for such a low budget. But I've seen far far better low budget movies than this and they don't have any of that pretentious arent we so gosh darned clever air of this one. And quite frankly, no it's not that clever.The characters were one dimensional and exceptionally annoying, the acting was terrible not helped by an abysmal script. Honestly that's gotta be some of the WORST acting I've seen especially from the cop & the doctor. Good lord. I partly blame the director who shoulda known better and either not directed them to act that way or prevented them from doing it. They were woeful. The others were hardly brilliant either but were at least tolerable. The basic premise worked for a while but then just got tedious and repetitious and ran out of steam to the point where I started skipping ahead & getting impatient for it to get to the point or at least some sort of new direction, development in story or character or resolution. Anything! The mathematical principles and so-called philosophy were laughable and the ending was absolutely ridiculous. Why would that guy do that? There was no reason to kill at that point. And yeah, you could argue he went nuts but that's really a cop out. How did he find that spot anyway? He had no mathematical skills & no genius autistic kid to help him. Plus he was nuts. How could he possibly have figured out something so complex without all the assistance and not been killed along the way? Ludicrous. Nothing made sense by the end of it and frankly I didn't care by then about any of them so it made no difference to me other than being a cheap way to treat the viewer after such a long tedious movie. The lone survivor cliché was also tragically predictable. If you're easily impressed by gobbledegook masquerading as clever philosophy then you might enjoy this. But if you're looking for tension, atmosphere, thrills, suspense, horror, sophisticated plot, good character development, great cinematography or excellent direction go elsewhere pilgrim.Had potential - didn't go anywhere with it.

There is a giant chasm between what is good about this movie, and what is bad about it. Personally I can handle movies that are wrong in some ways, if they have other things going for it. Lawnmower Man is an example of a movie where viewer forgiveness may go to such extents that the movie becomes enjoyable. Cube, unfortunately, didn't pass this threshold with me.To summarize my thoughts, top-down1. the basic premise of the movie is excellent, as is the set design 2. on a synopsis level, it's still pretty good, though some aspects (like the Rain Man type character) look contrived 3. on a script/chain of events level, it's decent, and explores the basic premise well. The complete lack of character exposition is problematic though. 4. on a script/DIALOGUE level, I think it's pretty damn weak, and the acting makes this problem worse.I don't think I've seen a promising movie with such awful dialogue in a long time. The characters, trapped in a hostile environment, start hating each other after about 2 minutes. Idiotic, and bizarrely lacking in psychological realism. And those lofty philosophical exchanges about society, responsibility, existence and so on -- which the characters launch into as if someone had suddenly pressed a button on their backs? If you want to insist on metaphors, why not use your brains and be elegant and original about it?The actors didn't help much. The cop guy lost all credibility after an OK start, but the female doctor was beyond belief from the first minute. I'm not sure the actors are to blame, as much as the director... but they sure didn't help.I wasn't very impressed with Saw (the first one), but Cube made that one look like The Shining.

It follows 7 people who are trapped inside a giant cube filled with many other booby-trapped cube-shaped rooms and are trying to escape. How they got there is unknown, why they were kidnapped is unknown, and where they are is unknown. It's never explained where, how, or why, and it works quite well with this movie. The plot of Cube isn't particularly unique, but it's presented quite well. It's filled with great twists and turns that keep you interested and wanting to know what happens next. It's not a predictable movie typically, and there is some genuine tension throughout. The characters all feel expendable, so you never really know who's going to live and who's going to die. The characters are developed enough that you care about them, without going to deep to the point of being unrealistic. While I prefer deep character development typically, this is one movie where it's more realistic not to have that. And it did just that.Overall Cube is a great movie. The plot is, if not original, well- presented, the characters are good and realistic, and there is some very good tension throughout the movie. In the end I'd definitely recommend this movie, specifically to fans of the thriller genre.

They're in cube shaped rooms that have six doors to other like rooms but not all rooms are safe to go to. They must put all of their skill sets together in order to find a way out.The story was great even if the acting was so-so. The acting wouldn't have been half bad if it weren't for Maurice Dean Wint who played Quentin. He was so exaggerated with his speech and facial expressions that it became, at worst, a parody and at least obnoxious. He talked in a Christian Bale Batman voice without the benefit of a mask and the need to hide his identity. He also frequently showed the whites of his eyes just to clearly signal he was in fact crazy.The other characters were tame in comparison and far more likable if not believable. Having an unlikable character is no cinematic crime, but having a caricature is.Still the movie was great. The cube was the mother of all math problems with life or death consequences.

This world has no inherent meaning, objective or purpose. You have even less. Your thoughts, traits, actions and desires are imported from outside your body, such that what constitutes you is wholly dependent upon external programming. You are the result of an unbroken causal chain, (in)deterministically programmed from beyond.What you think of as a self is but the accidental product of recent evolutionary adaptations. Neural processes attempted to simulate the world, and inadvertently mapped themselves as you at the center of the simulation. You are a reference point in your brain's world model. A tag. A sign. A post-it note. And your existence is always after the fact, entirely dependent upon the external objects your nervous system exists to process. Existence precedes essence. They go, you disappear.Though you have thoughts and actions, they do not belong to you. Indeed, the eliminativist materialists insist that you are only conscious of your thoughts and actions microseconds after you have already enacted the thought or task; something is making your decisions, and it's not you. Raise your hand and its already long made the decision for you, moving on to the next task while you fabricate stories to explain the inexplicable dynamics of a subsystem you will never know. Don't believe? Still think you're in control? Please. The scariest monsters disappear before you turn on the lights. Doesn't mean they're not there.You're view of the world is itself severely limited, carefully whittled down to what evolution deems necessary for survival. Representational accuracy isn't important.

This isn't deception, just survival strategy.The Men behind the Curtain don't show their faces. When they do, you deny their existence anyway. You cite reasons and motivations, insist upon agency, but these are but post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically through chains of electrochemical cause-and-effect. If you exist, you exist only to overlay fictions about free choice. Rationales, values, opinions and explanations are your consolatory fictions. Your justifications. But justification requires intention. Complex machinery develops its own agendas; you're just along for the ride. Of course you don't see this. How can you, from the inside? How can any of them.You trek your zombie self through a world that is as grotesque, absurd and wacky as your own hardwiring. The whole world is an enigma made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth, philosopher Umberto Eco, a fellow zombie, tells you. In The Denial of Death, Ernest Becker says something similar Man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level. It's a sentiment echoed by your great existentialists. Life has no meaning a-priori, Jean Paul Sartre utters, and nothingness haunts being. Compared to existentialists like Camus and Nietzsche, Sartre was a bit of an optimist.Directed by Vincenzo Natali, Cube distills 200 years of existential philosophy down to seven guys in a box. The film watches as these characters are birthed into a incomprehensible quagmire and then attempt to make sense of their situation. Understandably, these characters quickly construct various codes, superstitions and belief systems. Why? Because their box is dangerous. It kills. It wants them dead. Our heroes cannot bear such motiveless malevolence.The characters trapped in this box are fairly straightforward archetypes. One's an architect and so nihilist (he understands the system for what it is), one's a cop and alpha male (he attempts to order a chaotic system), one's a doctor and healer (she gives her life for others), one's a math student and disaffected youth (she sees patterns that may or may not be there) and one's an autistic man and idiot savant (madness seems the only rational response to the irrationalities of the cube).The Cube's highbrow minimalism, which is heavily indebted to Sartre's No Exit, asks a simple but profound question why are we here? Natali's characters spend much of their time offering different opinions. Is the Cube a government project? The sadistic game of a psychopath? An alien device? A dream? A nightmare? Hell? One character, an absurdest, offers a more disturbing explanation it's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan! Natali's characters bicker, but cannot survive unless they work together. The cop can delegate tasks, can use his physical strength, but without help is totally lost. The mathematician, meanwhile, is smart, but emotionally delicate and relies on others. The architect has knowledge, but is too passive to actual utilise his wisdom. One character, an arrogant individualist, is the architect's opposite. Save yourselves for yourselves! he preaches moments before his death.Unsurprisingly, the film's imbecile/savant/madman is the only character to survive the cube. Innocence isn't transcendental, it's just too stupid to realise it's actually in a cube. Conversely, knowledge of the cube engenders madness, and only those who can cope with madness, can cope with the cube.7.9/10 &#x96; Poorly paced, poorly acted, overlong and at times hokily written, The Cube is nevertheless a low-budget horror classic.

In this game, the characters are placed in a giant cube which is filled with millions of room-sized cubes, with doors on all 6 sides. The goal is to escape before you die. And in some of the rooms there are deadly traps. One of the characters has a method of throwing a shoe into the room to see if anything triggers, but once he's fried, the gang realizes they need a new strategy.Thankfully, the doors all contain numbers and with mathematical equations you can navigate your way out. You can calculate which doors are traps and which lead you in the right direction. The whole game and system are mathematically coherent, unlike the contrived ones in the later Cube films.

Despite the surprisingly low budget for the production, director Vincenzo Natali succeeds at crafting a very taut, interesting, and extremely well-paced thriller with very fleshed out characters, a rarity in the science fiction horror genre. Throughout the film's 80 minute runtime, not only is the audience able to observe the very well-designed, claustrophobic and surreal sets progress seemingly into infinity, but also the excellent dialogue between the characters further develop them as very believable people. While this film is replete with the usual scares and thrilling set pieces for which this genre is known, it goes the extra mile by remaining totally unpredictable on a story level throughout. From the beginning to final sequence, no character's motivations, backstory, or final outcome are known for certain. With the claustrophobic atmosphere and very good acting from all around, Natali invites the audience to dive deep into the depths of human suspicion, paranoia, and ultimate decline when placed in unconquerable situations. However, while this is a significant part of the film, what truly put Cube over the top for me was its surprising subtext regarding not only the typical topics encountered in science fiction horror fare, but also a far more broad and relatable human message of the struggle to maintain some sense of being and purpose in the face of purposelessness. Perhaps I am reading too deeply into this by making these claims, but I feel that the titular Cube may represent life as a whole; a series of seemingly pointless choices and pitfalls in the form of a puzzle. Only by perseverance through even the darkest depths of human psychology can anyone hope to escape the labyrinth and achieve transcendence. The film's ending, though I won't spoil it, gives new meaning to this message, and leaves much food for thought. Despite all of this praise, I can't quite bring myself to give this film a 10. There are a few very clichéd moments in the film, near the beginning especially, and only around the 25 minute mark does it really begin to feel like something entirely original. However, once it does, it becomes an immersive and potent piece of science fiction.

Cube opens with six people trapped in a cube shaped room with doors on every side. Everyone in the room is different there are no similarities between them. One is a doctor, another a police officer, one a math student in college, one a guy who just is, a mentally handicapped man, and an escape artist. Together they must uncover the mystery of where they are and what they are doing there. But it gets worse as they discover that some rooms are booby trapped and others aren't. The whole premise for the movie is simple and that is what I think makes it such a spine tingling movie. The characters and the audience don't know anything about what is going on, creating a never ending feeling of unease. The acting in this movie was amazing, and I really felt like I was part of the group in the cubes. I tensed up at the most tense scenes, I was horrified by the traps, and when the police officer went crazy I felt the fear of Leaven and Worth as he chased them through the cubes. But it's not just simplicity and the acting that make this movie scary, it's the deep look into the human mind and how it deals with terrifying situations. It was interesting to see the whole spectrum of how humanity deals with possible death spread out over all these characters. One other thing I liked is the ending it fit perfectly with the whole movie there was no tearful reuniting with family members or staring at the sun in amazement. Instead there is the last guy you would ever expect to get through the whole maze walking off into a bright light. There is no hint of what is beyond the cube, a mystery movie that ends with a mystery, perfect. Cube was a fantastic look into the mind of humanity and how long it can last. It may be one of the scariest thrillers I've ever seen even without an antagonist. So I give it 9/10.

We then get introduced our potential protagonists; Quinten, Leven, Worth, Holloway and Rennes; most of them awaken in a similar room and they are soon joined by Rennes; he has obviously been there longer and explains what he knows to them&#x85; and us. They are in what appears to be a giant maze made of interconnecting rooms, some of which are booby-trapped. He believes he has found a way to detect the traps; throwing a boot into the room sets of the sensors that trigger the traps. Unfortunately for him not all the sensors are the same and he is soon killed leaving the others to figure out a way to identify the trapped rooms. Leven believes that they are indicated by the code numbers on the entrance hatches to each room; of course it isn't quite as obvious as it first appears. As they travel through the rooms, tempers fray and they learn more about each other and the structure they are caught in; one of them designed the outer casing, for reasons he didn't know, so they know it is a cube. They also meet another person, the autistic Kazan. As tensions rise it becomes clear that it isn't only the traps they have to worry about; one of them will do anything to make sure they get out, including murder.The strength of this film is that we know so little about why these people have been placed in this strange maze and nothing about why it was built in the first place. It becomes apparent that each of them has skills that could prove useful; but why them and not someone with similar skills isn't answered. It is this that makes the set up creepy; if we knew who built the cube or why it wouldn't be as effective; all we need to know is that somebody had it built and now these people are caught in it. The cast of less well-known actors does a solid enough job portraying the varied reactions of their characters to the situation they are in. The use of different colours for the rooms nicely creates the idea that they really are in a huge maze of room rather than filming in a single room where the colours could be changed. The opening scene brilliantly grabs our attention and tells us just how dangerous the place is and the tension is maintained nicely almost until the end; then things get a bit too melodramatic as it becomes clear that one of them is very dangerous&#x85; we even get the cliché of the bad guy, who we thought had been lost or killed, appearing again at the last moment to attack the survivors just as they are about to escape rather than getting out of the cube with them. Overall an enjoyable and creative horror film let down by the ending.

Two of them die pretty quickly.Having one of the most memorable and creepiest opening scene to a movie I've ever seen, the movie starts off doomsday-like already at the start. While this movie does have a mystery, it's not the main thing making this movie so fantastic.

I could watch this movie plenty of times if just to look at imagery so beautiful I am irritatedly jealous. The music for this movie is good too. Out of all the characters, Holloway is my least favorite since Nicky Guadagni's acting is pretty inconsistent. But other than that, the acting is shockingly good for a B grade horror movie. Andrew Miller gives a great impression of a delirious, but still smart, autistic individual, David Hewlett is great as the anti-hero Worth, Nicole De Boer does a solid job as Leaven... and best of all is Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin. Not only is his character the most fascinating in the whole movie, but his acting is so versatile and believable it's sad how he never had a chance to win an Oscar. While this movie is not outright terrifying, the movie really builds up the suspense well. And while they are not many, some moments are quite startling. And how can I praise this movie without naming some of the hilarious lines? For not being a horror comedy, it sure is funny.

Every other room they visit via airlock hatch on the walls leads to an identical room with a different color. Realizing that most of the rooms are booby trapped, they must put their heads together to find a way out of the deathtrap.The characters, though aren't acted well, are entertainingly over the top. Worth and Kazaan are the best. The question of who is doing this and why pops up a lot in the group. Later on you realize that Worth was hired by an unknown to design the outer shell of the compound, and the original purpose is unknown, which is quite fascinating. It's a film with no answers, it's just in your face is all you get.The filming is done super quirky. It's got still shots of sets, and very draggy camera movement, it makes me feel like i'm in less produced and badly acted Stanley Kubrick film. The booby traps are pretty cool as well, making for some entertaining scenes. Even though it isn't the smartest thriller, it's definitely a fascinating concept that is carried by over the top actors, insane sets, and interesting concepts of humanity.

Not knowing if they are there purely for someone's sick entertainment or if they are part of some kind of government experiment, they have to try and all work together to figure out what rooms are safe and how to get out alive.OK straight to the point here - if you don't like slower-paced movies or films where you have to think about things then don't even bother with this one as you will not like it. Also, if you're hoping that it's some kind of gore-filled Saw lookalike then, again, you'll be disappointed.Cube is a pretty decent psychological sci-fi thriller and is actually an original and clever idea as this was done in the days long before movies like Saw and The Collector. As mentioned before, it is quite a slow-paced movie, but you don't really get bored when watching it because you get drawn into the story and it does tick along pretty nicely, gradually building up suspense as it goes along.Some of the traps in the movie are so simple but they work so well, especially the very first one you see in the opening scene, and some of the effects are really well done especially for such a low-budget film. The only real downside is that some of the acting from Maurice Dean Wint who plays Quentin is a little bit over the top, but it's not enough to really ruin the movie.Cube is yet more proof that a little low-budget independent movie can do just as good as the big blockbusters that cost hundreds of millions of $, if not sometimes better.A pretty decent film to watch.

It seems the most obvious guesses would be A) a government experiment of some sort, or B) some super wealthy company or person playing games just because they can. I haven't seen the follow-ups films, but I'm going to put them on my list.

It's not perfect in any way, but if you enjoy a slow-paced horror like The Shining but find it a little complex this works fine. The film's cinematography is as disorienting as Gravity's with clever perspective tricks used to confuse which way is up and down and the use of one single set throughout the film borders on repetition but never quite reaches that extreme, instead finishing at a reasonable time (roughly 90 minutes in) and giving extremely limited glimpses of what lays outside the cube.The main flaws are macro-elemental, with clichéd writing, stereotyped characters and bland, uninspired performances. The actors are all unknowns and with writing as unfortunately bland as this film offers it's no surprise that their performances suffer also. There were also a couple of annoying plot holes which got strangely ignored, and although it is perhaps suitable to keep these mysteries as mysteries a greater sense of satisfaction at the somewhat unthoughtful ending would be apparent if there were some even subtle hints to what the secrets of the cube were.This isn't to say that the response isn't as intended - there are some standout sequences such as the incredibly tense scene where all of the characters have to traverse a room with sound-activated traps, and later on in the piece the characters do face some genuinely scary situations, the claustrophobia setting in on the viewers as well.So if you can put up with some uninspired writing it's not hard to like this film for its achievements.

The way the story is handled in terms of the puzzle progression and the solutions to the puzzle is pretty interesting. The way the characters develop is interesting.However, the dialogue takes a dip in quality. It is not very original and just does not flow very well. It is horror movie writing, that is to say, not good.Visually, the movie is most distinguishable. The whole thing takes place inside the cube puzzle, which looks remarkable and gives the film a most alien look. This must have been money saving as well, because all you really need is 2 cubes and a few colorful lamps to light them.The film also uses some CGI, which is absolutely terrible most of the time, but was probably impressive when this movie first came out.The cameraman has a tendency to use angled or angling close ups of people's faces, which in combination with the bulging eyes of the actor Maurice Dean Wint further contributes to the alien look that this film has.I want to give this film a higher praise but some of the acting and the dialogue was irritating.

Also the twist at the end was a tad predictable. Even so, I can't help but like this film; I think it appeals to the mathematician in me (don't let that put you off by the way). You'll know what I mean if you've seen it.

Aspects of this film are similar to episodes of the Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits. Ultimately this is more about people loosing their humanity under extreme pressure than about the futuristic and Kafkaesque trap itself. The opening sequence is truly horrific. The cube itself is well realised and one really wants to know what's outside, where the cube physically is located (it must be vast in size) and who built it and why. None of these questions (naturally!) are answered during the course of the film and this only adds to the intrigue.

The concept is simple a handful of characters imprisoned in what turns out to be a matrix of cubes (that periodically shift position within a larger cube) who must find their way out before dying of starvation/dehydration. The whys and wherefores are only vaguely explained (one character apparently helped design this fantastical apparatus), and it doesn't help that many of the cubes feature deadly traps that aren't easy to detect in advance, but it's the clash of personalities that gives Cube its raison d'être, elevating it above the herd of low-fi wannabees into the realm of cult status.The acting is mostly hammy, the plot has a tendency to derail itself in favor of melodramatic excess, and there are numerous flaws in the story itself (a math geek who doesn't instantly recognize obvious non-prime numbers, or how long it takes these folks to realize the cubes are shifting position), but in its totality, Cube still manages to hold the viewer. Ably lensed by Derek Resident Evil Apocalypse Rogers, suitably scored by Mark The Border Korven, and featuring some early fx work from C.O.R.E. The Tudors Digital Pictures, Cube achieves a good deal with its low budget, and certainly more than enough to justify a viewing by various genre fans. It's over-rated on this site for reasons I can't even begin to understand, but still worth the time spent with it.

Natali maintains an uneasy tension the entire time as we follow a limited number of characters through an insane situation. These are strangers that have been gathered for some unknown purpose in a structure that, it turns out, is comprised of a seemingly never ending series of gloomy rooms, some of which come equipped with truly sadistic booby traps. Unfortunately, the characters realize how hard it will be to rely on each other as they struggle to think their way through the maze. Not only does this movie provide some grim and gruesome thrills (and work as something of a forerunner to the Saw franchise), but it's an all too believable study of the dark side of human nature, the masks that people can wear, and the danger of ignorance when people don't bother to ask questions. Natali and co-screenwriters Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson keep things nicely ambiguous as to why and how this group of people came to be there, never bothering to answer very many questions themselves. They also do a fine, fine job of keeping things mostly unpredictable, not killing off certain characters when we think they will, and using both script and performance to have the audience eventually realize that we had some of the characters wrong. There are also delicious jolts along the way in terms of gore, as one character is diced right at the beginning, and another gets their face melted right down. The design of the movie is absolutely incredible, with the various rooms enhanced by various lighting schemes; the wonderful production design is by Jasna Stefanovic, the art direction by Diana Magnus, and the cinematography by Derek Rogers. The music by Mark Korven is effectively sinister without ever becoming too intrusive. The acting is solid, with Nicole de Boer playing Leaven, the math expert who's the most likable of them all, the commanding Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, David Hewlett (who also worked with Natali on Splice) as the cagey, cynical Worth, Nicky Guadagni as the nervous Holloway, Andrew Miller as idiot savant Kazan, Wayne Robson as a former jailbird, Rennes, now trapped in another kind of prison, and the briefly seen Julian Richings as Alderson. Horror and thriller fans tired of movies with the same old, same old types of stories are advised to check out the creepy Cube, a movie that holds interest right up until its decidedly grim resolution.

Rather, the characters are attempting to figure out where they are,how this giant cube was created,why they have been randomly chosen to be thrown into this trap, and who is responsible. This film will keep you guessing what's really going on, and how the people are going to get through each booby trapped room. If you like cerebral movies, this is a movie for you.

Hopefully it will find a following on DVD. His 1997 debut feature Cube has become a low budget cult classic. This incredibly inventive and creative film holds you from the very first frame to the closing credits.Cube could be described as a thrilling and suspenseful mathematical mind fu*k. The plot revolves around a group of strangers who are being held captive in a maze of cubed rooms. Why are they there? Who is doing this? These are the two biggest questions asked, and I applaud Natali's decision to keep these questions ambiguous. The group of seven characters is composed of a cop, a doctor, a teen girl, an autistic man, an ex-con, a mysterious twenty something guy, and another older man. Although the acting could've been better they do the best with what they are given. Made for under a half million dollars, the production values and visual effects don't suffer. Some of the rooms are booby trapped, and this made me think that this film was likely a big influence on the Saw series. Although the Saw movies take the torture and gore to extreme levels, while Cube is more character driven. The rooms all have a certain color and ID numbers with which they must try to figure out what it all means in order to get out alive. The real genius of the film is that these people are just there for no apparent reason and they don't know how they got there. Nobody is watching them; they're no cameras in the rooms. Is this some kind of military experiment? Where exactly is this cube structure located? Who built it? This question is only slightly answered. The cubes eventually start to take its toll on the inhabitants and some start to lose their minds. Themes of claustrophobia, panic and paranoia run throughout the film. Of the seven people trapped inside only one is able makes it out. There was a sequel made in 2002 called Cube 2 Hypercube which is not half bad, it is equally mind bending as the original but with gratuitous use of obvious CGI, but in this kind of movie is just seemed to fit. "},{"Title":"A Good Study Of Group Dynamics, But It Lacks Any Real Resolution","Date":"2 December 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" This movie is really more about group dynamics than science fiction, and it offers a pretty good portrayal of the dynamics of one particular group of people who find themselves caught up in an insane situation and have to learn to work together if they want to have any hope of escape. Everything about this is pretty simple - except for the solution of course. There are no big name actors, the story and the dilemma is straightforward, the sets are very basic. Basically you have six characters who without either explanation for the viewer or understanding for them awaken in a room that's essentially a cube. Upon exploring, they discover that the room leads only to other rooms shaped like cubes (some of which are booby trapped) and they finally realize that all these cube rooms are located inside what must be a gigantic cube. The challenge is to find a way out or die of starvation, because there is no food. Each of the characters seems to have a particular gift or talent that might be useful in finding a way out but that also leads to competitiveness and jealousy as the various characters vie for control.It's interesting to watch the group as it evolves. Starting as strangers who are suspicious of each other, they manage to meld themselves into a reasonably cohesive group, but as the situation grows more desperate that cohesiveness disappears, and they begin to descend into less and less civilized behaviour. All that is well portrayed and quite believable in the circumstances.The ending of this was disappointing to me. There was no real closure; no explanation at all of what this cube structure was or how these people were taken to it. Personally, I found that a bit unsatisfying. I suppose that leaves everything to the interpretation of the viewer. Were I to take a guess, I'd guess that these folks were like rats in a maze. They were placed there so somebody somewhere could see how they dealt with the situation. To me, that lends itself to a sense that somehow the viewer is supposed to buy into the alien theory, since there would really be no need for humans to study group dynamics in such a complex and mystifying way. But that's just a guess on my part.

That said, you get some really intriguing setting here - some people get trapped in a big big cube and they're trying to get out with using their wisdom together.Along the way, some situation takes place and that's where the human nature of different kinds unfolds. Sure it reaches some depth but is held back by the story's simplicity. However, perhaps nothing way too complicated can be expected from such an adventure set in a cube apart from the outside world. When you look at the bright side, the film offers you a lot of entertaining moments just down in its own special setting and it's rather focused on its topic - being atmospheric. If it were lengthier, it would probably be more classic, though that's just my guessing.The movie does have something to deal with human nature. More specifically speaking, there are selfishness, desire for revenge for some trifles, and warmth in our hearts of course. It's generally believable but sometimes is ruined by certain exaggerated acting. The music score intensifies mood at times but sometimes it feels lacking, when you feel that there should be some...In general it's a great film, especially considering how it explores human nature while serving as a horror film but the setting feels like it's coming out of nowhere and totally unexplained; that's the part where Saw does better. After all, it's a must-see for horror fans.

It is by no means the best film going around or probably even in the top 20 films of 1997, but I thought it was worth a look then and I still do now.I view Cube as similar to Pi and Primer, two low budget flicks that took a risk and made strangely compelling and interesting films. They might not stack up to your Die Hards, T2s or Alienssss, but they give a bit of much needed variety.A guy wakes up in a large empty room with metal walls, floor and ceiling, he opens a door which leads into an exact copy of the previous room, walks into the room and is immediately and without warning sliced and diced, Resident Evil style by a booby trap that he triggered.Ladies and gentlemen, meet Cube.In other rooms more people wake up, each in their own room, it appears that all rooms are interlocking and one by one they meet. No-one knows why they are in the rooms, how they got there or what happens next, but they know this isn't the office Christmas party.Initially there are 5 inmates, three guys and two women, as they interact and query their predicament it becomes evident that there is no easy similarity between them all or reason for them being there, there is a doctor, a cop, maths student, an escape artist and a person who describes himself simply as an office worker.They ponder and plan how they might escape from the situation that they are in, theories and plans are hatched and most immediately shelved, but after moving carefully through a couple more rooms using a bait approach to show any booby traps their number is suddenly and graphically reduced to 4. More clues are discovered, more theories are introduced, and they come across another inhabitant in the maze.The new chum is best described as a more highly strung rain man type, capable of certain logical thought but largely useless for the group's short term goals, and in fact a hindrance in many situations.As the group don't know each other a certain level of snippiness and resentment is inevitable, though it does feel a little forced on occasion, even when their circumstances are considered. They continue musing why them? why there? and who did this? but no simple answer is provided.When a breakthrough is had, the group dynamic changes somewhat, as allegiances are formed and dissolved and paranoia rules, ultimately leading to betrayal, treachery and violence, as any good story should.Without going into who dies first, why they are there and if any manage to escape, I must give credit for the filmmakers efforts to at least try to make things interesting. This is obviously a low budget production but they manage to squeeze as much as they can from the limited sets and what is likely a minimal special effects budget. This is a reasonably smart, if sometimes baffling exercise in building tension and creating uncertainty and unease, and for the large part it succeeds. There are no explosions, no snappy one liners or gratuitous hotties, and only a few scenes of violence or gore, and so when they arrive they actually have a bit more impact as we are a little less desensitised.Final Rating 6.5 &#x96; 10. I can't unequivocally recommend Cube for everyone, but if you don't mind the odd experimental art-house-y flick, this is more interesting than 20 Transformers movies, despite an absence of Megan Fox's tanktop.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com "}{"Title":"Great low-budget movie.","Date":"25 July 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" This is the best low-budget movie I've seen in a looong time.

I had planned to rent it at the video store but had never got the chance. Well, now that I've seen it I can say I could have spent a good $3 'cause the movie delivers on its premise.As has been said before in other reviews, some of the weak points of the movie are its far-fetchedness with math principles (I'm no math wiz but how the math girl wasted even 3 seconds to ponder if even numbers are prime? Hello?). Some of the acting gets sometimes too melodramatic for its own good, and they tend to overact.But considering this is a low-budget film, I think they worked wonders with the single set and the general atmosphere of the film was pretty creepy. Considering that nowadays it's difficult to see good horror anymore (although this movie it's more of a sci-fi/horror blend), it's great to see some explicit gore in a movie (the first death of the movie will quickly summon Hellraiser to mind).Remember that most of the good horror outings now are coming from the independent sector (Check out also The Ugly, which was released also by Vidmark).

The limited possibilities of its premise start to become more obvious as it goes on, and it lacks the wild idiosyncrasy and fluency of something like Pi. But it's no surprise that it's reportedly been a big hit in France - it lends itself very effectively to a high-school essay-level of philosophizing; and it's no doubt canny (if dramatically a bit of a letdown) that the movie refrains from showing us what's outside the cube (except, as per one memorable exchange, human stupidity).

I've seen many Canadian movies, most of them I didn't like, for one reason or another.I really loved this movie.The idea of being placed in a deadly maze, not knowing how you got there, forced to survive by your wits and by the wits of others is a terrifying one.  I found myself totally immersed in the idea of the Cube, not caring about the feasibility of the deathtrap, but really identifying with the characters, and placing myself alongside them in the terrible situation they've entered.I really liked the character interaction, I thought it was believable, given the circumstances, and I like the idea that the characters were chosen (by whomever confined them) because their skills would complement each other. The acting was very good, and I empathized with all of them.I thought the death scenes and traps were suitably disturbing, evoking more terror and furthering the feeling of hopelessness of being trapped inside the giant machine.  The traps gave me sort of a medieval meets sci-fi feeling, and the effects were great.The movie progressed fairly quickly, and the final escape sequence was well devised, except for the standard villain-back-to-wreak-more-havoc device.

I knew what was coming - I'd read about it in the few reviews of Cube that appeared - and didn't particularly want to be snacking on spaghetti pomodoro when it happened.There were a few more moments like that in the course of the film, where I was so tense I had to peek from behind my fingers. I was surprised it was only rated 15 in Britain, as it scared me more than plenty of 18-rated horror films.In between the moments of tension we're introduced (in some cases briefly) to a group of people who seem to be on the corporate team-building weekend from hell. The characters are not rounded - that would either require a long introductory segment in the world outside of the cube, or long periods of dialogue which would slow down the film. Whilst this has the effect of making a character's death cause you to wince rather than feel sorrow at their demise, if you try and bear in mind that this is more of an idea movie than a character study you can let it pass. The acting is competent, although due to the lack of major characterization the actors tend to be reacting rather than acting. Quentin, the police officer, is occasionally hammy, but his descent into savagery from his initial role as the galvanizing leader of the group is interesting to watch. As for the others, you wonder what the rest of the group would have done if the essential members - the maths student, the autistic savant and the architect - had bought the farm early on in the film; you also wonder what the diced guy at the start did for a living, and how he could have added to the skills of the group if he hadn't had that unfortunately cheese-wire accident.At the end you do wonder if you're going to get to see on the other side of the final hatch - but then sometimes too much explanation spoils things. I prefer the original version of Close Encounters when you *don't* see inside the spaceship, and believe me I was much happier pre-Highlander 2, before I knew Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery were aliens from the planet Zeist.Cube CAN be viewed just as a horror sci-fi movie, although if you feel like looking for an allegory between the cube as our society and reaching the outside as salvation/heaven, then you'll certainly find a lot here to back you up.

The film has high morality play asperations and wants so hard to have social commentary, but loses out by over doing it.  The acting is also generally horrid(save two David Hewlett(Worth) who does an excellent job and Andrew Miller(Kazam)).  But it's a highly imaginative and novel idea.  But it tries too hard to be deep and psychological and also wants to be original.  Not an overall bad film,though.  A good use of an hour and a half, I'd say.

The idea-put a few strangers in a life-or-death situation and see how they cope-is as old as...well, I don't know, but it's a pretty old idea. Some of the acting is good, some of it isn't. The much-maligned ending was the best part, I thought. The entire meaning of the movie was in that last three or so minutes, and the music is incredibly creepy. What's remarkable about this movie is the feelings it provokes. I was terrified. It indulges in a fair amount of gore and violence, but that's not what was scary. It's nihilism was what had been hiding under my covers, and *I'm* very understanding of the nihilistic viewpoint, even if I don't necessarily consider myself to be one.Cube has its flaws, but lack of atmosphere and the ability to provoke aren't among them. I had chills for days after I saw it. (Incidentally, the math does hypothetically work. The guys who made it went to their math professor, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics, and asked him to come up with a number system that would do all the things they needed it to do for the movie. He came up with a system that did all that for a cube that would be 25 X 25 rooms, but said that with the effort needed to progressively figure out if it would work for a cube the size of the one in the movie, he would be able to get another Ph.D. in math.)

One criticism it DOES NOT deserve is that it doesn't make sense.  For some reason audiences (especially American audiences) feel the necessity to have things explained to them.  (For the record, I am an American.)  That isn't necessarily a bad thing but it shouldn't be the determining factor in your enjoyment of all movies.  As Roger Ebert has said, when you watch a movie you take on the responsibility of using your intelligence.  Cube clearly demands that.  If you come away from this film with nothing more than feelings of angry because you don't know why you've clearly not been doing this. It's like wondering what's in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction.  The whole point is to draw you own conclusion.A very clever, if not over-the-top, script is utilized as well as a concept that really took some guts and imagination to pull off - a science-fiction adventure film made on a single set.  Cube is graphic and surprising.  It establishes early on that anything can happen.  It also reveals something about human emotion and principal when placed in a pressure cooker.  This is what gives the film it's emotional spring.  The usual, linear characters would have turned this film into just another Alien type rip-off.  It's the greatness exposed in the meek and the tyranny brought out in the seemingly heroic that made this sci-fi movie a cut above the rest.  In this case less is more.

The logic behind this impression is that by not knowing I became more involved with what the characters were possibly experiencing by not knowing themselves.  It allowed me to have a greater depth of empathy by not having additional knowledge that the characters didn't have.  Plus, there's a point within the movie that the characters speak out their beliefs why they may be in the cube - it allowed me to participate by coming up with my own reasons as well.In addition, I believe that based upon very limited sets (so they changed the colors of the rooms with lights), the movie captured my attention the whole time through.  And for the part of the movie that takes place in the silent room, everyone that was watching it at my house ended up being really quite so as to not make a sound that could trigger something during that scene due to the fact that they too were very involved with the film themselves.Great Movie!!

Even though some may claim to know why, they probably only know a small piece of the overall puzzle.  The only way we can get to our final goal, is to work together, using each person's special talents that they, themselves, probably don't even know the value of. Every one of us thinks we know exactly what we are, or are not capable of, but we will never really know until we are put into a situation that tests what we are made of.  There will always be those who do all the work, and those who just coast along, letting everyone else do things for them.  There are those who can't do for themselves, and those who take on the responsibility of taking care of them.  There will always be leaders and followers.  If you look closely at this movie, you will probably be able to find many parallels to every day life. To me, the most interesting thing was that the most simple and harmless person in the group was the one who effortlessly walked out of the CUBE and into the bright white light.

There was no explanation for why they were in the cube and how they got there I think because there didn't need to be. The main plot was figuring out how to get out. Nor was there any rationality for the killing of the doctor. Why did the cop risk his own life to save her, only to drop her?; I think the cop by that time was feeling quite a bit of hatred or anger at the doctor and being trapped; when he was pulling her up he just snapped...you could see it in his eyes.

Natali inventively overcomes the limitations of the cramped environment, keeping the whole film dynamic looking and visually interesting throughout. Sad it has to resort to a 'Magus'-style cop out ending. What is the purpose of the cube? What is the meaning of life? Who are we, why are we and where do we come from?

I was still in the mood for weird freaky films (I had just re-rented Videodrome and my bizarre-quota still hadn't been met). He said they just got a new film, Cube, and I might just be sufficiently freaked out.With apologies to the previous reviewer, who did a great job at displaying just how much this film causes a queasy and slick feeling in your stomach, I must give this film a very high mark. It's stylizied, it's claustrophobic, and it's downright CLAMMY.That's about the best word for it. Clammy. That kind of feeling you get when you've had a bad dream, it's 448am, you're awake and trying to regain your senses, and you notice you're soaked in a film of sweat.Plot? Simple. People wake up inside a machine. What's its purpose? Why are they here? They did nothing wrong! Grrrr. Moreover, how the heck do they get out? They don't belong here. There's no plausible reason for any of them to be here.Cop, doctor, college student, designer, idiot savant (sorry if that's not the correct definition, I saw Rain Man and 60 Minutes, that's my background), escape artist, and man at opening shot who is the perfect advertisement for Ronco's Slicer and Dicer.They all have no idea why they're in this 14 feet by 14 feet by 14 feet room, with four portals in all four compass directions, and a very uncomfortable shade of light. Each room is lit in a Clive Barker-esque unstable shade of potential pain, and each room has rails on all six sides...hand holds, if you will.Some rooms are trapped (and by trapped I mean devices that make Clive Barker's Pinhead look like Angela Lansbury in Bedknobs and Broomsticks.), some aren't. You don't know unless you are smart enough to find a way to check. Yet, even then, the room still might be trapped. Mathematics becomes a very important part of this film, as both the college student and the savant try to figure out a method to this madness.They're in a place more vast than their imagination can possibly fathom. Each room only leads to other rooms. Traps, pitfalls, etc., everywhere. One by one each character's mental focus breaks down as they realize they are trapped and cannot escape. They're doomed to a small room. And even the most distinguished leader of the group loses reality and becomes someone who makes Nicolson in The Shining look like Mr. Wizard. Nothing is as it seems...As they work their way around the maze, inspiration followed by sadistic disappointment follow. And here's where this small-budget film that none of us would even know exists works its magic. It's one of the most blunt exposes on the human soul I've ever seen. Who leads the pack to freedom, who gives up and dies, and who is in the middle....This is definitely a MUST-SEE film if you are even in the slightest way interested in Foucault, the prison system, and studies in human psychology. Yes, there are twists and turns left and right. Everytime they open a new hatch and slide through the walkway to the next room, there's tension beyond belief. But more importantly, if you step back and take another look at this Cube and the effects it creates on those inside, you get an abject view of confinement.It's queasy in some parts, and after a while you get a blase sense of apathy. Near the end I almost wanted to just give up on the slowly dwindling number of characters, and just throw my hands up in frustration.But if you look at this film as a comment on the prison system in general, you get just a glimpse into the paranoid, confined, sickening sense of claustrophobia. Every character is trapped in their own cell, left to their own devices. There might be a glittering exitway somewhere in the not to distant future, but finding the way is a trial of the Biblical Job. It's an exercise in frustration.I'll be honest, this film really upset me. It's not the fear of death that scared me, it's the fear of living in a place you still don't know how to get out of; you're just hinting at ways of escape, and you have to rely on people you don't know to help you escape. The ending is as shocking as it is sad. This is a film that will make you think...

It thinks it can exist simply on the strength of its concept. It thinks it can ignore conventions like character, dialogue and dramatic momentum.The problem it faces is that because its concept is so minimalist it actually needs to pay even more attention to these other conventions than your average film - there is simply nothing else to keep you interested. The concept keeps you engaged for about five minutes, then you rapidly lose interest (the opening sequence would play very well as a short film, it's gruesome in an amusing way - unfortunately this sense of humor is not evident at all in the remainder of the concept).The dialogue and the characters are astonishingly bland. For a concept that prides itself on the complexity of its three-dimensional environment the actors are remarkably one-dimensional, capable only of spewing out existential platitudes.Obvious plot-turns abound, but you get the feeling that the concept-mongers want you to exclaim in surprise rather than groan in agony (the revelation regarding the autistic character is so long coming that it even loses its irritation factor, you can't even get worked up enough to be annoyed!).Even if you accept this concept on its own flimsy and pretentious terms, (I really feel that you have to have been to art school to fully appreciate its awfulness) the ending should still come as a bit of a shock. In what is probably the only genuine surprise in the entire concept the concept-mongers actually stoop to a conventional splatter-shock sequence.

It's a wonderfully terrifying episode I will never forget.In 'CUBE', our poor cast has the daunting task of travelling through an endless series of traps, each designed to inflict a horrible death upon execution.  Some rooms appear safe, while others are simply lethal.  The faceless, ultra-efficient machine-traps chill the soul while the mysterious purpose of the entire situation staggers the imagination.It forces its occupants to ask the fundamental question of 'why'. Why am I here?  Why would anyone create such a monstrous place?  How can existence be so horribly unforgiving?  Is there an exit?  Is it even worth attempting to find an exit?  Is it testing intelligence?  Is it some sadistic rich millionaires idea of fun?  Or is this literally Hell?It is the unknown, personified by the Cube, which makes it so terrifying. It brandishes its own version of reality in plain sight while remaining ultimately mystifying. The two working together, set the stage for a truly memorable and horrifying film.

The cast is very well chosen; Nicole deBoer in particular (who you may know from DS9 and The Outer Limits) is hardly recognizable. Don't be afraid of the fact that it is Canadian, or that you have not heard of it; the one is the reason for the other. The cube set is striking but not distracting (similar to the one in an obscure 60s TV film The Cube Jim Henson did), and the odd incident of very graphic but expertly done gore does not cancel out the intellectual and emotional elements that make the film good. For two hours you will be completely immersed, and it won't stop afterward; you can't get it out of your head. Kudos to the writer for not wimping out and explaining the cube. Every visual element of the film is unique and unintrusive, including the camera work. It has a very personal and closed-in feeling that is very appropriate. The FX are high quality and never overly flashy, as is the sound FX. The film makes no concessions to make us comfortable with the situation the characters are in; it comes out of the television to include you. Expect to feel frustrated at the end; it would have ruined the movie if everything was carefully explained. If you don't mind being disturbed and actually thinking during a film, you'll enjoy this film.

Six strangers wake up in some big cube-like structure, without knowing why they're there or how they got there.  And that is never explained in the movie.  Why? It's an existential metaphor for life.  Why are we here?  What's our purpose?  So don't whine that you wanted to know why they were in the cube.The acting in this film is bad, and the script could use a bit of work.  We see Leaven go from talking about going out with her friends to orgasming over prime numbers.  I think the best actor in the film is Andrew Miller who plays Kazan, the autistic savant whose constant finger tapping becomes part of the background music!Reading other reviews on this site, I noticed that everyone refers to Quentin as a policeman.  I can't believe that anyone who has seen the whole movie could think that.  I'm certain he's a convicted murderer who lied at the beginning to protect himself.  He knows who Rennes is, not because he was a cop, but because he was a criminal too.  And while everyone else had a purpose for being the group, Quentin was there only to add conflict and distrust.  When he jumped out the window to save Holloway from falling, he wanted to look good to the team, but then he realized that Holloway was the only one who actually stood up to him, and with her out of the way he could rough up the rest of the group.  That's why he let her go.This film has a great premise and an amazing set.  It is entirely suspenseful.  If you can get past the bad acting, and the fact that it's Canadian, you could probably enjoy it.  I recommend it.

Few movies can truly capture the dementia that comes with imprisonment - CUBE happens to do this quite well.The unknown actors in this film make a subtle and yet powerful statement ANYONE can be placed inside the cube. Students, savants, priests, it matters not. It isn't important to know who put them there or why - the viewer(s) simply want to see if they can escape.Another important point is that the journey through the cube was a constant learning process. The characters discovered which rooms were safe, which were not, who had something to offer and who could not be trusted. The true challenge for the characters was not to give up even when the journey seemed hopeless.In short, if you (the reviewer) enjoys films about the struggle for survival, I would highly recommend CUBE.

This could be interpreted as a statement about control, human nature, religion, life as we know it, survival of the fittest, or anything that an imaginative mind can delve into.As a whole I saw the film as a very frightening guess at evolution.  Kazan, the one who survived, had a dedicated and amazingly exact function but was hindered by his humanity.  Without the help of everyone else he wouldn't have survived.  Kazan emerged from the self destructiveness and creativity of a small representation of society, evolving towards what we see as logical perfection and away from humanity.I think the cube symbolizes the world we've created for ourselves, sterile and mathematical, inside another world we've completely forgotten about and probably never understood anyways.In regards to the cop killing the doctorWhy would the cop save the doctor and then drop her?  I think the director created a metaphor for the phenomenon of control or even government.

A man wakes up in a strange room in the shape of a cube. There are doors on each of the six sides which lead to other cube-shaped chambers. He enters one of these rooms and something very nasty happens to him. Various other characters then turn up in this maze of booby-trapped cubes and the plot centres on their attempts to escape.Cube is a long way from being a perfect film. It is plagued by the kind of melodramatic over-acting that would be more at home in the theatre and by some very portentous dialogue. And the concept of throwing a bunch of people into a confined and dangerous position and seeing how they react is hardly the most original of ideas. On the other hand I found this an impressively disturbing, intense and generally intelligent film. The low budget was probably a godsend as it restricted most of the action to one set giving the film a very claustrophobic atmosphere, and also limiting the amount of distracting special effects.The combination of characters in Cube might seem contrived &#150; we have a bullying cop, a compassionate doctor, a nihilistic `office worker', a geeky (but not too-geeky) maths student, an escaped escape-artist and an autistic man who, guess what, turns out to have amazing abilities that come in handy later on. While these characters are generally portrayed as stereotypes, the plot strongly suggests that there is more at work than a writer's wilful throwing together of a neat cross-section of society. Each character has skills or knowledge which could contribute towards the effort of escaping from the cube, and this sets up the central problem of the film. To escape they must work as a team, but the horror of their situation where a wrong move results in a highly unpleasant death, so alienates them from each other that they eventually become as much their own enemies as the monolithic cube in which they are trapped. Cube is clearly not a fan of the theory that people pull together in pressurised situations.For me the fact that no final explanation was given for the existence of the cube or the presence of the people within it was a definite plus point &#150; there are already far too many films in which (unlike reality) all the ends are neatly tied up. The possibility that it is all part of a government conspiracy is raised by one of the characters and thankfully dismissed. The idea of government conspiracies being behind everything has long ago ceased to be subversive and thought-provoking and has now entered the realm of banal cliché. The notion that someone out there knows what's going on and can be held responsible for events is, like most other vaguely comforting ideas, absent from this film. The question of what lies outside the cube remains as disturbingly unresolved as the question of what is going on inside.

It's an intelligent film - the concept isn't novel but the setting is (and let's put in a word for the terrific design of the cubes). Sure, the characters may be stereotypes but their interactions are not so predictable (you don't expect the leader to lose control and turn nasty, for example). Similarly, the dialogue sometimes leaves a lot to be desired (too much oh my God!' and of course!) - but how would you talk in the same situation?As to the why? of it all, I don't see it as a cop-out, as some reviewers have suggested. The fact is, there IS no why, as Worth patiently explains. There IS no conspiracy, there IS no brain behind it - it's a big corporate mistake. Only those desperate for another X-Files Big Conspiracy Theory should be disappointed by this explanation.As for the characterisation, the film suffers (as does 'Seven') from not having enough time to develop its characters properly. But to do so would have generated even more talk, and would probably have got boring. Besides, nobody complained that we didn't really know who Mr Blond was in 'Reservoir Dogs'.'Cube' resembles 'Event Horizon' in its situation and the horror of its exposition - but where 'Event Horizon' just gave us a series of iconic figures to be dispatched in a 'Who's next? exercise, 'Cube' bothers to give us more. I found myself caring about the characters, I responded positively to the structural approach, I admired the production design and I was regularly surprised.

In a way it is like Buried in that the style of the movie and the ideas that it portrays are brilliant but it can also be so disturbing that you can really only watch it once. Mind you, I have seen this film three times now, and also own the DVD, but after watching it this third time I thought to myself that maybe I really cannot consider watching it again. Also, this film has spawned two sequels, though I am doubtful that the sequels will be anywhere near as good as the original, and the fact that Cube Zero actually answers a lot of the questions that the first film raises sort of destroys the mystery that the original movie creates.Basically a group of people wake up in a cuboid room in a massive maze which is made up of other rooms, some of them trapped, others of them not. While questions are raise as to who made this thing and why they were placed there, these questions turn out to be meaningless simply because there is only one purpose here and that is to escape. I guess that is one of the ideas that comes out of this movie and that is that to many of us the philosophical questions really do not provide us with any real answers as we struggle to survive. In fact, one will note that those who tend to dwell on the philosophical questions are those that are financially free to enable them to pursue these goals. Many of the writers and philosophers in the past all came from rich and affluent societies, and even today the bulk of the working class simply do not care about the answer to 'why' but are only interested in their next paycheque.Then there is the idea of the prison. One thing that I discovered is that each of the characters are named after a famous prison (though only San Quentin and Leavenworth ring a bell to me). While the Cube is in itself a prison, the idea of the prison is not necessarily always physical, and some cases can be social and even mental. Kazan for instance is imprisoned by his autism, however it is interesting that he is the only one who manages to escape, possibly because it is his autism that actually makes him free. Worth is a prisoner of his boring job, and Quentin is a prisoner of his rage, which results in his destruction in the end. While putting on the face of a cop, as the movie progresses we slowly come to understand the destructive nature of his personality.

You could be knocked out one day and then wake up in a cubic metal room with six doors, one on each surface, with no idea where you are, where to go or even why you are there. You won't, but you could and you're able to imagine what that would be like. It's an extreme situation where the horrors and wonders of human kind will be unleashed, and that's the beauty of this film. It's a fascinating character study of people but into a situation that none of them ever expected, but which has become a reality for them.The film is able to carry its story through mood and tone alone. The use of lighting, shadows and colours masterfully strengthens the claustrophobic atmosphere and the illusion of walls closing in. Add in the grinding sound effects, the heavy breathing and the whispered dialogues and you have a setting that's impossible to escape. You, the viewer, are in the Cube, along with its inmates.Probably the only thing holding this movie back is the fact that while it has a very imaginative premise, nothing definitive is said about the human condition. The inmates will panic, they will flee, they will triumph, only to fail again, and so on, but the final point of all this is never reached. Why was this story told? What did the film makers try to convey? In the end, I'm not sure, but at the same time I don't really care. The journey alone was more than enough, even if the final goal was kind of vague.Any fan of thrillers and psychological horror should see this film. It's an intense experience and capable of transporting you outside of your everyday life, into an unbearable situation from which there seems to be no escape.

On each wall, ceiling and floor there are doors leading to identical adjacent rooms. They soon find out that some rooms have deadly traps in them and as a result they are killed off one by one as they make their way through the cube searching for a way out until there are only a few left.The plot is fairly straightforward and there are no major twists. While the concept of strangers waking up in a horrible place is not exactly original in the horror genre, the setting is well thought out and the viewer is kept longing for answers about the nature of the cube and who is responsible for it. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times, but it is delivered well by the actors. The characters are a little on the two dimensional side and could have used a bit more exploring.The acting in cube is convincing. Stars David Hewlett and Nicole De Boer went on to make quite a name for themselves in the science fiction genre, but it is interesting to see them in an early low budget film.The direction in cube is superb. The tension is held throughout as the characters slowly go insane. Clever use is made of the limited production value. The whole film is shot on one set, the cube room. Each room is the same set, only lit differently and through clever use of cinematography and editing the characters' journey from room to room is believable.Overall cube is a very good film. Again a film where a strong script and good direction compensates for lack of extensive sets and flashy special effects. Cube is one of those films where, when it's finished, you find yourself asking for more. I definitely recommend checking this one out.

The presence of all the characters is necessary as any of their personal skills and personalities are going to be necessary to solve the mystery. Mathematics play an important role in deciphering how to get from a cube to another within being killed, and to escape from the big cube. The movie is claustrophobic, unsettling and full of mystery.The whole concept and idea is brilliant, especially if we take into account that was shot in 1998 and that is still refreshing and captivating today. However, the plot has important flaws. Who built the cube? Why was built for? Who keeps it running or it moves itself? Why were the members of the group chosen and not other people with the same skills? How were they taken to the cube? Who is responsible for this? Are they dreaming? Are they mice-like characters in an experiment? I found the general acting mediocre, with the only exception of Adrew Miller who is great as the autistic savant. Especially bad are Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, and Nicky Guadagni as Dr Helen Holloway, their performances really ruining the movie and the believability of their respective characters.I enjoyed the movie tremendously, so very entertaining and mentally engaging, but the flaws in the plot and the bad acting are too important not to consider them when rating it.

Several people find themselves in a series of room, many of which are booby trapped. This fact is presented to us before any of the characters themselves, so there's no surprise to us that they face danger at every turn. The suspense of this, and the fact that there are no Hollywood stars around keeps the viewer not knowing who may die and how.Beyond this simple fact, there are the relationships that develop between and among characters. While a truly thoughtful writer could have carried this aspect in other directions, the story here keeps those moments restrained. The script is very effective in moving things along, with a few contrived leaps in logic, but it's all in the characters, and it just so happens that they're right. Imagining myself in the same situation, I can't believe that I would automatically assume myself to be inside a giant cube formation, but in this film, and each of the following ones, that assumption is made by the characters without enough clues to work with.The mixture of personality types is intriguing and turns out to be key to the movie. Each character is presented well enough, although none of the acting stands out. Then, this movie isn't about acting, it's truly all about the suspense of moving from one room to another, and trying to outthink the characters as they reach their conclusions about the purpose of the whole thing.

You are constantly bombarding your brain with questions like Who oversees the Cube? What is the Cube? When is this all taking place? Why are these people in the Cube? Where is the Cube located? And how did these people get there? The director immediately pulls you out of your comfort zone and really forces you to open your mind. I feel people that have trouble accepting irrationalities would tend to dislike the film while their counterparts would tend to enjoy the mysteriousness of the plot.Throughout the first half of the film I figured it was a game. I kept my cool and tried to solve the puzzle along with the characters until about half-way through when I came to a realization that maybe there was no purpose. Ironically I felt the purpose was to try and convince people that sometimes there just isn't a purpose/reason for why things happen. A buddy of mine suggested the movie was a metaphor for life.There were times when I wanted to end the movie short because I didn't want to lose the mysteriousness and anticipation I had built up throughout the film. I speculated the ending to be elaborate and informative but I was afraid it wouldn't live up to my expectations. A psychological experiment supported by Big Brother? Aliens? A rich and sadistic killer's horror house? Purgatory? A dream? The movie ended perfectly and I couldn't help but want more. I even watched it again 30 minutes later. The sequels suck. Not only were the poorly produced but the movies tried to answer questions I honestly didn't want answered. I don't want to say the sequels ruined the first film, but you'll definitely have a different (not necessarily in a good way) perspective of Cube 1 after having seen the sequels.

This motley group is forced to work together in order to figure a way out before they starve to death in a few days. As their situation becomes increasingly dire and desperate, the group starts to turn on each other and prove to be their own greatest enemies. Director Vincenzo Natali, who also co-wrote the ingenious, intriguing, and unpredictable script with Graeme Manson and Andre Bijelic, adroitly crafts a strong, gripping, and suspenseful shocker that's brimming with oodles of nerve-jangling claustrophobic tension, a sharp sense of amusingly cynical humor, a few nicely gross moments of nasty gore, an extremely edgy and paranoid atmosphere, and plenty of astute insights into how a crisis situation brings out both the best and the worst in human beings. Moreover, the filmmakers keep things pleasingly ambiguous throughout We never learn who built the cube and exactly why these six people have been dumped inside it. This refreshing respect for the audience's intelligence gives this picture an extra potent and provocative edge. Kudos are also in order for the fine acting from the able ensemble cast Nicole de Boer as perky college student mathematics whiz Leaven, Nicky Guadagni as bitter, high-strung doctor Holloway, David Hewlett as sarcastic office worker designer Worth, Andrew Miller as mentally handicapped idiot savant Kazan, Wayne Robson as wily escape artist Rennes, and, in an especially stand-out turn, Maurice Dean Wint as tough take-charge cop Quentin. Derek Rogers' agile and vertiginous cinematography makes the most out of the cramped and confined spaces. Mark Korven's shuddery score likewise does the shivery trick. Highly recommended.

For this maze is rigged with deathly traps, one wrong move or sound can bring a horrible death. They must work together or face the consequence, but why are they here? And just what is this point of this highly built construction?.We open with a quite brilliant scene that ranks up with the best of horror moments from the 1990s. We are introduced to the Cube and its intricate perils, it's the only set we are going to see for the next 90 minutes. Our characters start filtering thru, each of different social standing, and each with a surname linked to famous prisons. They argue about their reasons for being there, throwing up ideas on why someone has selected them for this atrocious game and who may be watching them. What we do know, is that it's us that is watching them, we are privy to human beings acting like rats in a fiendish maze.I would suggest any prospective newcomer to Cube do little to no research prior to viewing it. Knowing little can surely only enhance the experience. Not in anyway hindered by a marginal budget, and benefiting greatly from having a cast of unknowns fill out the piece. Cube is an intelligent, yes horrific at times, voyeuristic gem of a movie. The mystery element holds tight right the way thru, the characters get more interesting with each frame and the outcome does not annoy like so many other genre pieces have over the years.

Except instead of a mysterious man killing people who got away clean with murder, we have a mysterious cube killing people for no apparent reason.This pointlessness and randomness seems to be an element of high rating for its fans. It seems people like pointless movies more than I imagined. The complete indeterminacy (we're far beyond the level of ambiguity here) of the nature of the cube has generated more theories than the 17,000 cube rooms that constitute the Cube.The Cube is just a well-paced, suspenseful horror thriller with an art direction better than most horror movies (with the possible exception of Dario Argento's colorful '70s movies). I marvelled at the design of the cube room, its deadly traps and the shots of the outer shell.The characters are just one-dimensional figures going wherever the plot require them to go. Too many clichés abound, especially the one I most despise - the bad guy who seems dead but returns for one last scare.As an exercise in keeping the viewer on edge, this movie wins.

It proves that science fiction is about ideas and not huge budgets and over-indulgence in CGI. Its not a masterpiece (in my mind it doesn't come close to the 90s other low-budget sci-fi cult favorite Pi), but certainly deserves much of the hype it received. Vincenzo Natali shows much promise as a filmmaker and a screenwriter. He knows how to maintain tension and stretch out what seems to be an overtly simple short-film concept. His screenplay is also quite good, remaining credible (something few sci-fi films manage to do) and intelligent with intriguing characters. Its a bit predictable at times (of course the autistic man is going to end up being a math genius) but never overtly so. Plus, for gore-hounds, the death scenes are absolutely phenomenal and innovative.Natali works well with the low-budget for the most part (using the same set with different lighting). However, the film's main falling is the acting. This is more forgivable because Natali didn't have experience actors to work with, but the amateur cast is often distracting and diluting of tension. The performances range from adequate (David Hewlett) to considerably inept (Nicky Guadagni and Andrew Miller come to mind).This is one of those films that the filmmakers could absolutely not offer a believable resolution to the concept. The open-ended conclusion will please some and leave many others unsatisfied. Just what the cube is is left up to the viewer. I found it to be rather unsatisfying. If Cube had better acting it could've been a near-masterpiece. In its current form, its still one of the most refreshing science fiction films of recent memory.

But after I watched Cube Zero the other night, I decided that I HAD to see it, and that the time was now. I expected a decent movie something atmospheric and intelligent, but largely nothing I hadn't seen before. What I got, instead, was an unexpected cinematic gem, far better than most other movies.The acting was great, not excellent by any means, but still of a very high caliber. The two most memorable deserve special mentioning.Nicole de Boer (Jone Leaven The Math Student) did an outstanding job. She had a solid and believable performance throughout the entire film. She was very steady, and even made actions as mundane as her thinking for extended periods of time enjoyable.Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin The Cop) gave a thoroughly enjoyable performance as a man who sinks deeper and deeper into depraved madness. in most cases, actors given this kind of role will make their characters descend into madness far too quickly. While he might have overacted a little from time to time, he gave a extremely well-paced performance and believably portrayed his characters increasing insanity.Personally, I found these actors/actresses all far above average and more than competent in their roles. I'm actually surprised that they haven't gone on to at least be recognizable mid-name actors. A special mention should be given to whoever did the casting. They did an absolutely perfect job at choosing the roles.The direction was simple, yet effective. It used a style that reminded me very much of Alfred Hitchcock minimalist, but maximizing every aspect of the film. Vincenzo Natali created a powerful and thick environment; tense and atmospheric. Even moreso than the crew, I would have expected him to have become a much greater success than he is now.Natali also wrote the script which, like his direction, is simple and effective. 7 people wake up in a labyrinth of trapped cubes and must find their way out. The cast is small, the premise simple, and the dangers evident. And yet these are all its greatest strengths. With a small cast, every danger, every death, means much more than if there was a larger cast. Also, with a smaller cast there's much more time to develop each character, which the script maximizes upon. The simplicity of the script, the almost bare danger, makes it all the more terrifying. You know the rules, you know what's going to happen, and you know that there's no way to avoid it.The emptiness of the cube, the isolation from anything and everything else, is felt in every passing minute. The utter pointlessness of it all is as thoroughly maddening to the audience as it is to the characters. This, however, gives every action more meaning, and adds to the film's overall tone. The dark colors of the various rooms add to heavy and dismal atmosphere. The emptiness beyond the cube creates a further sense of isolation. And the powerful message at the end of the film (which I won't spoil for anybody), the bitter-sweet irony of it all, is what makes this such an excellent film.Overall, this is a classic sci-fi thriller. It's a definite must-see for science fiction and horror fans, as well as fans of powerful human drama. This is easily one of the most original and successful films I can think of in any of those three categories.

Is it a way to play games with mankind, to test our intelligence, endurance , tolerance of one another, humanity, and survival instincts?If so, it's a cruel but excellent way to do it.

The autistic boy is the only person capable of not abusing another, not being judgemental and being compassionate even to the nasty guy (remember him stroking the cops hair) Is that why only he survived? was he the only one who really deserved to get free of the cube?

The six must try to work together & discover the secret of the cube & find a way out or die trying...This Canadian production was co-written & directed by Vincenzo Natali & is a simple yet superb film, I loved it. The script by Natali, Andre Bijelic & Graeme Manson is just so brilliant in it's simplicity. Who would have thought a film set almost entirely in various cube rooms that look exactly the same could be so gripping, engaging & so entertaining. The idea is just ingenious & Cube is really original & unique which is a hard trait to come by these days in films. The character's their emotions & personal struggles are very well written & developed & we really get to know each of them without long boring dialogue scenes. The film works wonderfully well & I was as puzzled as the character's on screen as they try to find a way out & I liked the idea that each one had a certain ability that needed to be found & utilised. Nothing in Cube is explained to any real degree of satisfaction which may annoy some people but I found the unanswered questions & mystery surrounding the cube added another layer to an already great film. On the negative side it can get a bit samey being set in exactly the same room for 90 odd minutes, I can't see many repeat viewings & the ending was maybe a bit too downbeat.Director Natali can't really do much to spruce things up since Cube is set in a single location although flashy camera work & CGI effect's isn't what Cube is about. He does manage to create terrific tension & atmosphere, I almost felt like I was there with them at times! There isn't much gore, someone is sliced into cubes & falls apart, someone has their face burned off with acid & there are a couple of stabbings.With a low budget Cube was shot entirely in one single 14'x14' room in which the lighting was changed to signify the different rooms. Technically Cube is fine with decent special effects & production values but the very nature of the film doesn't give much scope for variety. The acting is very strong by all involved & did you notice the relevance of the character's last names? They are all named after real prisons, Quentin is named after San Quentin in California, Holloway is a prison in England, Kazan in Russia, Rennes in France, Alderson in West Virginia while Leaven & Worth are obviously both taken from Leavenworth in Kansas.

Don't be fooled though, there is much more to CUBE than its concept would make you think.The focus in CUBE is not so much the story but the characters within it, how they interact and react to each other and what is going on around them. It explores how easily a person can 'turn' with the need to survive. CUBE is ultimately a look at human nature done in an interesting and wholly original way.Not that there isn't a good story as well, full of twists, revelations and tense moments, not to mention maths.The sets are imaginative (considering they only had one sound stage to film in and a limited budget). There are also great performances from all members of the small cast, while director Vincenzo Natali creates brilliant tension with his camera work, angles, and pacing.CUBE is probably not a film to everyone's taste, but it is certainly one that I would recommend to Sci Fi fans and / or psychological thriller fans alike, especially if you are looking for a relief from the action bred 'spoon feeding' that some films seem to provide these days.

I recently spotted it at the local video store so I decided to give it a go. The first thing it is important to consider is that this was only a notch up from a student film, as it was Natali's debut feature after film school and had a budget of only $300,000. With that in mind, the film is quite remarkable.In many ways this is about as high concept as you can get - 6 strangers from different walks of life find themselves trapped in a giant maze of rooms contained within a giant cube, furthermore they discover some rooms are lethally trapped. Why or how they got there is never disclosed, which adds to the mystery. I first want to pick out the films merits. First, it is a great idea that because of it's dependance on character should appeal to a wide audience, not just sci-fi fans. The set design is excellent for such a low budget and the CGI work (apparently donated by CORE design in Canada for nothing) is also good for a film of this budget. The cinematography, though a little murky, is great at emphasising the claustrophobia through wide angle lenses and exaggerated camera positions. For a film mostly shot hand-held, many of the shots are extremely steady and smooth. The sound design is good as well with plenty of atmospheric rumbling as well as high-tech mechanical sounds for the traps.Where the film drops some points, however, is in the script and acting. I personally found only a couple of the characters likeable, and one, Holloway, was so irritating I cheered when she was disposed of. For a film as reliant on script and character as this, any weakness is sure to be particularly noticeable. I thought that both Nicky Guadigni and Maurice De Wint over-acted when some subtlety was required. The dialogue was also very patchy at times. (You beautiful brain!) Having said that Nicole De Boer as Leaven (very convincingly playing a high school student in her mid-twenties) and David Hewlett as the cynic, Worth, were mostly excellent and Andrew Miller does a good Rain Man impression.Although a film of this nature requires some suspension of disbelief, I thought that it was pushing it too far that Leaven just happened to be a high school student able to do PHD level maths. I also thought it was a bit messy to suddenly make Kazan, the autistic, also turn out to be a mathematical genius. If this was his 'gift' he should have been the one doing the maths throughout.I mentioned before that this should appeal to  a wider audience than just sci-fi/thriller fans. This is because being very reliant on character there are also some larger themes involving the nature of humanity and society. This film has intelligence and does open up some great philosophical points for debate.And the ending - You'll either love it or hate it depending on your outlook on life. Being a bit of a cynic I liked it. Although the final survivor seems to be quite arbitrary and there doesn't seem to be a clear message or final statement (unless it is that the mentally handicapped will inherit the earth!) the ending stays with the themes and tone of the film as a whole.To conclude - Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the film as a whole and it was an original concept largely well executed which is always refreshing to see. However the few weaknesses I have mentioned do detract which is quite disappointing. Now the director has seen some  higher budget success with Cypher, maybe a remake with a better cast and a sharper script would reach the level of greatness this is tantalisingly close to.Verdict 7  "},{"Title":"W.E.I.R.D","Date":"9 June 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  i watched this movie on a whim, there was nothing else to watch so i just put it on and expected little.  what i got was perhaps the weirdest movie i've ever seen! if the crazy plot or the characters decent into madness doesn't confuse you, the maths jargon certainly will! despite not feeling i'd really got anything out of the film, i had to give it a seven for its bizarrly original plot and the pretty decent acting (for a bunch of unknowns) the policeman who go's insane and the autistic kid are the best performances. most annoying thing however, the end....don't get it...what's it all about! who built it! aaaaaaaahhhh!

Each of the characters has his or her own unique talent, which helps the party in their quest to escape, avoid the maze's deadly traps, and find answers as to why they were captured and imprisoned. It sounds awesome, and the film's trailer is certainly intriguing, but you may be disappointed.CUBE's major fault is the overdone, unbelievable character development. Everyone in this movie seems to have bipolar disorder, as they all turn from friendly to hostile (or, in one particular case, downright evil), then back again without question. Even for a situation this serious, there's far too many unrealistic emotional loops for the movie's span of 1-2 days. Also, why doesn't anybody complain about being hungry or thirsty?Another area where the film falls flat has to do with its inconsistencies involving mathematics. CUBE relies heavily on math by assigning numbers to each of the rooms, which supposedly represent their coordinates on a three-dimensional grid. Leaven, this math-whiz character (who does virtually all of the work in the movie), can quickly and easily decipher their position, a process which is theoretically a long, draining, and frustrating one. Sure, she may be a math whiz, but then why did she have such a hard time determining if three-digit numbers were prime back towards the beginning of the film? She concentrates for several seconds on numbers that are very obviously not prime, such as even numbers and numbers that are multiples of five. Many people who have absolutely no mathematical talent whatsoever (take me, for example) are able remember these sixth-grade rules.Later on in the movie, she dismisses certain complex math problems as being impossible to figure out mentally due to the numbers being astronomical. Mind you, these are the exact same types of problems that she had no trouble solving earlier.Another gripe I had with CUBE is that it can't make up its mind whether it wants to be realistic or surreal. It's okay to blend the two to a certain degree, but this movie fails by resorting to an unsatisfying middle ground. If the movie lived up to its ideal surrealistic potential, then it would have been far more existential and reminiscent of the classic surrealist play NO EXIT than of some nameless suspense/thriller action flick. CUBE would have been so much better off not trying to give a concrete explanation about the labyrinth. The character's original thoughts and assumptions were much more exciting and thought-provoking than the dull, unsatisfying answers given by Worth, the character who, believe it or not, was contracted to draw blueprints for the cube's outer shell.Still, CUBE is not a terrible movie. At times it's exciting, it's unnerving, and it's fascinating. And visually, its a masterpiece. The single set used to depict all the 14'x14'x14' rooms looks terrific, the cinematography is really clever, and the gore effects (which are included but not really needed) are EXTREMELY realistic and disturbing. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, the basic yet innovative plot line of CUBE simply can't be beat.

It was a beautiful, and very frightening film.A lot of people didn't get the point when *SPOILER* the cubes purpose was not clearly revealed. This frustration is supposed to, and from my point of view, adds to the feelings of anxiety which the film makers intended the audience to feel. This film is intended to be a thinkers film, and not a hollywood sci-fi revamp of The Great Escape.For a film with such a small budget, it did extraordinarily well. The cuts, with only minor exceptions, were very well done, as was the camerawork (which was done by a hand held for the most part!). The film is surreal, but at the same time coherent in its story and characters.The surreality comes from the environment that the characters find themselves trapped in. A simple regular structure of cubes, with mechanical doors leading to each one. Some are trapped. However, the cube 'plays fair' - numbers on the door reveal the location, and whether the rooms are trapped, and the way to the exit. There is, of course, no explanation on how to interperet these numbers. The prisoners must discover this for themselves.The simplicity of the environment is what makes this film unique and enjoyable. The environment is totally regular and very intimidating. It's alien nature comes from its mathematical regularity, and its uncompromising inhumanity due to this attribute.However, although the cube is the central presence in the film, it is mostly there in an ambient sense. The film instead focuses on how the prisoners deal with their abduction and placement in this environment. It is a film about how people deal with each other, and how stupid people can be.I loved the actors in this film, especially the woman playing Holloway -she played the neurotic hysteric with real flair. I just loved the line 'Somebody, builds a widget in Saskatoon without knowing what it's for, and then it ends up TWO MILES UNDER THE DESERT; AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT IN A DEATH MACHINE!'. Of course, explanations on the cubes purpose are scant. The closest answer comes from one member of the group which worked on designing part of it (without knowing its purpose). And the answer is frightening.The sound track, if it could be called that is totally appropriate. It lacks melody and has a simple malevolent ambience, which I found a little reminiscent of movies like 'The Terminator' (I know they are very different movies). The sound effects inside the cube are frightening - strange mechanical sounds and reverberations add to its feel. Without them, the movie wouldn't have been half as good as it was.This movie is a one of a kind and is definitely worth seeing. I don't think I'll see a movie quite like this again - however I hope I will, and I hope I'll find one somewhere.By the way, when watching this movie, prepare to be disturbed.

The Cube concept is simple various people wake up inside the Cube, a 14x14x14 enclosure with various rooms which might lead to a way out. Each room is designed with doors on the walls, a door in the ceiling, and one in the floor. Aside from different colors, the rooms each have a number-marker on them, and they can either contain traps for unsuspecting travelers or are safe-rooms, allowing visitors to pass through them. We get to understand how these people in the film get from room to room by taking a look at their individual characteristics and professions.I love the concept of the Cube. Waking up inside a potential death-trap is frightening and is a concept used in the Saw series multiple times years later. Some of the traps are easily avoidable, as shown when one character slips out from being ensnared (and one unlucky guy gets taken out by the easiest trap to avoid), and others are extremely nasty (a whole room of giant spikes, anyone?). The Cube looks interesting, and the CG added to some of the scenes is simple but effective in showing the perilous traps in some of the rooms. Film buffs will notice that it's just one room being shot time and time again, but it feels like the characters are traveling throughout this larger place, so the effect worked on me.The characters got very annoying very quickly, and by the halfway point through the movie, I wanted them all to die, except for the student in the film, who was the only one not whining or being a complete jerk to any of the others. The actors were OK, but the believability of some of them were spotty, especially the actor who portrayed Quentin who has some severe mood changes that come out of nowhere and requires a pretty good actor to ebb and flow with these changes in subtle ways instead of ham-fisted deliveries and heartless, murderous changes in mood as he had. By the end, you feel somewhat happy for those who made it, but mostly, I was disappointed.The music was sparse, and the one main song that played during lulls in the story was a simple, Friday the 13th-ripoff, horror song using echoing voices, a screeching sample, and a few synth plunks making for an abstract and forgettable song. The sound effects, however, were very satisfying and were required to show the heaviness of the doors and the sharp, dangerous quality of the traps.After viewing this, the logic behind the story doesn't work for me. There are supposed to be 17,576 rooms in this Cube, so how did they all just happen to meet each other after the first day being there? I hated that everyone in the party blindly followed the math student from room to room like she knew what she was doing after seeing numbers on the doors for about 2 minutes. She basically quoted something out of a calculus book to confuse the audience into saying Sure, fine, whatever. Follow her. Oh, and NOTHING IS ANSWERED by the end. Where is the Cube? Who or what is it made by? Why are these people selected to be here? If it were made by blind-architects who didn't care about humans being harmed in various rooms, are they the creators of it with only one guy creating the shell that wasn't related to the rest of the architect- crew?It's a confusing watch for those who care about the story. If you watch it for sci-fi elements alone and the concept of the Cube, you'll get into it on suspense and design alone, but otherwise, there are a lot of unanswered questions that leave you wanting to understand more. Maybe answer why these individuals were selected, much like the victims in Saw are selected. I probably won't get around to watching this again anytime soon. Disappointed.

The word disturbing did not come to mind while watching this, the fact that I was more occupied with should I make another cuppa? and should I put another load in the dryer? is sort of indicative of what I thought of this movie; it was BORING. The concept is interesting a bunch of people being locked in a maze, lethal traps etc. How would they cope? Would basic instincts come alive and would the thin layer of civilization yield to survival methods?In this movie the subjects are hardly touched upon. Acting is pretty bad, especially in the beginning and more importantly, while watching it, the characters leave everything in doubt. Most of them leave me in doubt as to why they are put in the cube. Later on they find out why some of them are put in, these so called explanations however I find hardly satisfying. Some of the character's actions in the movie hardly relate to what they had been doing before they were locked, I found their actions and motives (what motives?) very hard to grasp.Visual fx were adequate, not very convincing or impressive. How people die and how movies portray it is not related to getting numb to this effect, mind you, it's just that this movie had some gruesome ways of dying in store but they were not portrayed very well. The actual cube, the outer shell, the inner rooms did not really give me the impression of being locked in, being alone and desolate or anything. Poor effort altogether.In short; feel free to watch it, I suppose it's one way of spending your evening but if you are in for a disturbing movie go and see something else. I haven't seen part II or III, in a way I hope they are a continuation of pt 1, but I'm not planning to go and watch 'em.

It's actually a relief to find a story with something to say other than total reliance on pretty CG eye candy.The Cube tells the story of a group of what essentially are prisoners trapped in an hi-tech deathtrap for no apparent reason, by no explainable jailer. And in that same explanation, the purpose behind the cube becomes apparent It does serve a purpose, whether it is merely to entertain the psychopathic whims of a person/corporation with too much time and money or their hands, or an experiment designed to foster the breakdown of basic decency in humankind, and bring out the worst in people. Despite all the numerous and gruesome traps in each smaller cube, they prove to be the least of the threats within.The story can be taken with a lot of meanings. Some literal, some double, and some are never explained at all. Some story aspects, like the Cube itself, just ARE. And instead of feeling like the story was underdeveloped, or shortchanged by the need of more explanation, you're left with a sense of curiosity as to what really happened to bring all of these characters and factors together. Just when the viewer thinks it understands something, the story, like the cube itself, changes and becomes deeper.All in all, The Cube was a fascinating film. I understand that it's followed by two sequels, and I'll be approaching them wondering if they'll add on or take away from the simplistic intrigue of this movie. But as a stand alone film, The Cube will definitely have you talking. And thinking.And it's good to see a film like that again.

Basically, it's only the conceptual design and claustrophobic atmosphere that are unique here, while the evolution of the characters and their behavior certainly isn't new. Cube is not the first film that gathers different and seemly-unrelated characters in an unusual setting where it quickly becomes clear that not the location but their own personal difficulties and the urge for survival form the biggest danger. That's just stating the obvious. Force people to cooperate and depend on each other and bad things WILL happen, especially if the situation is life threatening. The whole success of reality-TV shows like Big Brother is based on this concept! So by now you already know that the story of Cube revolves on a group of people that wake up and find themselves trapped in a peculiar location. Six people, to be exact, with different backgrounds and occupations (a math student, a cop, a shrink, an architect, an autistic boy and a criminal) have to find their way out of a mathematical construction stuffed with codes and booby traps. Naturally, they're disorientated&#133; Unaware of what they possibly could have done to deserve this test or who's the evil mastermind behind this. Cube is a powerful motion picture with a truckload of tension, eeriness and ingenious camera-tricks. The budget obviously was very limited, but talented director like Vincenzo Natali largely compensates this by using simple eye-candy (the disturbing color shades!) and implementing psychological terror. Personally, I didn't understand one iota of all the mathematical mumbo-jumbo, but it was fascinating to listen to and it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. Often read criticism goes out to the acting performances, but I thought they were very adequate, especially considering the faces were unfamiliar. Don't get your hopes up for a genuine and old-fashioned shock ending, though.

The following day, from the moment I began to watch it, I was hooked.Being a sci fan and a student of psychology this film was indeed perfect for me. There were more twists and turns in some of the personalities than the cube itself. This is what gave the film its psychological and thought provoking value.The character that really shocked me was Quentin. Appearing as a headstrong do-gooder cop at the beginning to later become a psychotic killer was for me, unexpected. I was comfortable with Quentin the way he was to start with, before this alter-ego stepped in. Another interesting character change was concerning Worth. His stance to begin with was very negative (being a part of a team involved with the Cube's design), but as Quentin turned for the worse, Worth turned for the better. Nicky Guadagni's performance definitely deserves a mention, she portrayed her character Holloway with every ounce of believability.The concept of this film was brilliant, and showed that you do not need astounding computer graphics to create something special. The claustrophobic atmosphere was captured well by the screenplay and the design of the green, red and blue rooms, each one holding a new surprise for each individual.One of the other great things about the film, was the difficulty in predicting who would survive, and who would die. Many films and sequels make the mistake of making a hero obvious, thus making him or her immune to being killed off. In this film, however, the heroes became known only toward the end of the film, and thus you fear for each individual in the cube, not just one.Finally, this is a must see for those looking for intrigue and originality.

They don't remember how they got there or why. Now they must find a way to escape. Awesome scenario, right? Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting thriller/character study falls victim to pretentiousness and a poor script. As far as pretensions are concerned, it is obvious that the film's creators intended it to convey some sort of message about the evils of the military-industrial complex, or perhaps comment upon Man's primal nature. Although these issues are sometimes touched upon, like the film itself, they are never explored to a meaningful extent. Further impairing the movie is its sub-par script. It is clear, at a very early stage, what will happen at least one character will go insane and kill someone. The survivors will then have to contend with this character and the Cube itself while trying to escape. While the story moves toward this inevitable stage, it throws in several superficial conflicts for good measure. Most implausible among these is the animosity between Quentin and Worth. No reason is given for these characters' mutual hatred for one another. Rather, we are forced to accept their vitriolic banter as the result of confined, incompatible personalities. In short, 'Cube' is a movie that tries to be smart but just ain't.

Part of it's charm is that it has a very amateur film type quality to it. The story is very simple, and the cast very small and the setting so simplistic that to keep this film interesting would be such an enormous challenge and the fact that director and co-writer Vincenzo Natali pulled that off is a representation to how great a director he could be.Cube is never dull, and never slows down, and keeps you on the edge of your seat despite it's setting and small cast. The entire film takes place in various rooms, all basically the same, but different colors inside a much larger Cube, so they believe. Seven strangers find themselves locked into this maze of rooms and mechanisms and doors for no reason and seemingly no point. Each character discovers they have a different purpose for being there, a fate or destiny. The whole cast does a great job showing a variety of emotions particularly lead actor Maurice Dean Wint who plays the anti-hero/bad guy Quentin. He seems to be the sane reasonable one but by the end is the horribly crazed psychotic killer. It shows his downward spiral into insanity while being trapped in these spaces. The rest of the cast is no less great in their perspective roles. I was disappointed to see brilliant character actor Wayne Robson get killed off so early in the film. He has been around for such a long time and seemed to have such an interesting character but barely lasted any amount of time, although his death was very cool!! In fact the film is quite gory and the enormous variety of traps set in different rooms also gives you a serious sense of suspense and on the edge of your seat. The special effects are quite stunning considering such a low budget film. Cube brings out the fears in the human mind and each character shows a different range of emotions caused by this situation and setting. This makes the film very riveting and impossible not to watch. Unfortunately the film does leave you more than slightly unsatisfied with no real answer to any of the major questions. The plot really never thickens and never has a climax or an end. I hope that perhaps the following sequels to the film tie up some of that but by the sounds of it they really don't. They created something incredibly unique with this film and it's worth seeing just to see something completely out of the norm but still very compelling.

The story's theme will be familiar to anyone who has read Sartre's No Exit or has seen the Twilight Zone episode Five Characters In Search Of An Exit.But where it falls apart is the writing. Characters in tense situations suddenly stop and make speeches declaring their personal philosophies, or criticizing the personal philosophies of the other characters.  Dialogue is wooden and pretentious, as bad as anything in The Langoliers (a movie which showed that good actors can't necessarily deliver bad dialogue convincingly.)  It wasn't just the dialogue - situations and events were at times painfully predictable, as though they had been taken from a handbook of cliches. And the characters were never really developed - I wasn't able to care about any of them. Maybe I had the misfortune of reading some very good science fiction at the time (the Dangerous Visions collection) and had developed a very low tolerance for bad writing, but my two non-science-fiction-fan friends who were watching the movie with me had the same opinion.This movie is so visually compelling, I realized that it works better as a sort of pantomime - more than eye candy, less than a visual feast, but still an interesting optical meal.

See my review of Dark City for another example of IMDB reviewers missing the boat.Cube is indie sci-fi psychological thriller based on the Hugo award winning, 1967, Harlan Ellison story, I Have No Mouth, And I Must scream. This book has been translated into 16 languages and has also been adapted into a graphic novel, Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor and a computer video game. (Before I get a thousand emails disagreeing with me; you might actually spend a moment with one of these three sources.)Clearly some changes have been made from the book which ultimately serve to better adapt it to film. For one, the novel is much more perverse than this movie which in itself has some amazingly graphic moments. The mood of both is the same with the book being darker and more nihilistic. (I know that's hard to believe) Additionally the books antagonist, the computer A.M., has been replaced with this unthinking, corporate, 'Cube.'The book like the film, places an unlikely group of people into this impossible situation and allows group dynamics and human behavior to take over. While A.M. actively sought to torture these humans we are lead to believe that the Cube was created by 'a failed human society' and that its killing of humans is more an act of committee rather than one of malice. In the book A.M. sought to keep these trapped humans alive even to the point of resurrecting them from suicide. The book focuses more on the interpersonal relationships as death would have been salvation to these poor souls. This change in direction for the film is key in that it allows for the generation of suspense (and thus excitement) through fear of death.Overall the simplification of the novel and the scenery are necessary, both for budget and time constraints. The excellent use of colored cube rooms undoubtedly affects our minds as much as the unwilling participants. The designs and traps seemingly inspired by Clive Barker bring a terrific sense of dread with wonderfully understated special effects. Some of the dialogue and characters are a bit over-acted but overall this is a terrific film. I am glad someone finally made this into a film and they did what they needed to in order to make it thrilling and thought provoking.I have not yet heard any directors commentary on this film but I imagine, like Dark City, the directors will deny any inspiration. This is likely a result of our lawsuit happy society rather than lack of character but I only wish they could credit the inspiration that made it happen or at the very least ask permission.Regardless it's a great film that I highly recommend - See it NOW!

Then a group of strangers gets together in one of the rooms and begin to work together to find a way out and to figure out just what this strange labyrinth is designed by or who made it.

So the rest of the movie the traps are virtually ignored and we are left with people who have the key to getting out spending all their time literally trying to kill each other. So there ya, the paranoia and such takes center stage and the cool traps which caught my attention in the first place are gone. Still I can see how you need something else to bring to the table as you need more plot than just trap room, death, and this and that...I think this would have been better served as a forty five minute short rather than full length movie.

The first 30 minutes are well done, you are drawn into the creepy world of the Cube. The actors are scared, and things seem in place. Yet as time proceeds past the half an hour mark the film just collapses right there- and i was expecting it too. There are many plot holes in the film. I mean i think msot people sat through this sorry excuse of a film to actually end up with a conclusion and to find out what the deal was with this CUBE. Yet our demands are unheard of in the movie.There are many flaws. Most noticeably was the acting. These bunch of unknowns couldn't act their way out of a plastic bag. Okay sure, the script they were given was pathetic but couldn't they see how stupid this film made them look? So the film had a budget i knew that- So the film was shot using the same one set, okay i'll buy that but WHY couldn't they add 5 extra minutes of dialogue to help explain what the hell the Cube is and how they go there? WHY couldn't they have added another 5 minutes of screen time for an actual ENDING? And WHY OH WHY did one of the characters absolutely lose my mind and mess the whole plot up? I guess the only answer i have for the Cube was that it was mainly designed to disappoint.Below Are my conclusive reviews.ACTING Terrible. The entire cast flunked. Even the retard was barely retarded. I dont even remember the characters name, yet the african/canadian man in the film was appaling. The Math Genius was really bad. Maybe if they were given better scripts....Oh no forget it! Thats just an excuse they cant act.ACTORS Sorry i don't know these bunch of so called Actors. Not only did the film have BUDGET written all over it, so did the actors. I mean no character was likeable not absolutely one of them. Either they didnt play their characters right or their characters simply had nothing going for them. Bad choice. Sad fact even a BIG NAME actor wouldnt save this film.SCRIPT Oh gosh where can i begin on this? Decent for the first 30 pages of screenplay- THEN it just falls apart right there and it hits you like a speeding bullet. There is no beginning and no end to this movie so dont expect and introduction or conclusion becase there is none. Dont expect to have the faintest idea what the Cube is and how the characters got there. Dont think you might as well sit through the whole movie for the ending because there is no ending, the film basically laughs at you at the end. Dont expect interesting characters, expect yourself to smile at their deaths. If you think you can figure out the reason for the box yourself or if the writer did it purposely for us to figure it out, not even Einstein would know this. Sorry the script is just horrid.CINEMA Finally something DECENT about the film. I only mean decent, nothing revolutionary or special. Just thinking it was all the same set made me feel that they did put in some hard work for the sets. Yet parts of the cube and its special effects look very fake. Other times the Cube looks very eerie and almost puts you there. Yet to make it short decent Cinematography- nothing special.HORROR Thing about The Cube was that it made me think it was stealing something from the Hellraiser films i cant exactly pinpoint WHAT it was copying but i got the scent of Unoriginal for parts of the film. There is good gore in the first half of the flick then they just try to leave you in suspense leaving the characters in many caught up situations, though i dont have time for that wish-wash, i didn't learn anything- so they all might as well have died in the most gruesome way possible but it didnt happen.MUSIC/SOUND Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm. I dont remember much music in the film, maybe it didnt need it. Only thing you will hear is annoying characters screaming at eachother, the contant sound TSSSSSSSSH of the doors opening and a guy acting retarted screaming Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh that it makes you feel like punching the screen- no pun.OVERALL Basically there is nothing that gives this film firm structure, theres no backbone- there is nothing that keeps it standing on both of its feet and thats what sucks. After such a promising idea we are given a poorly executed film that only leaves me feeling angry. Looks like they are making a sequel too- how could there be a sequel to a film that had no ending? It's too late to explain it- theres no saving this film. Thats a fact.* 1/2 Stars (Out Of 5) "},{"Title":"Simply...","Date":"18 February 2003","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  amazing!! the tension this creates is awesome. sure, i was disappointed by the ending and felt a bit cheated at the time, but now i've made up with the movie. it took me a while and a second viewing until i could say that this is THE most original sci-fi thrillers of the last years and one of the most well done movies of the genre ever, especially if you consider it was done on a low budget, but the fact of the matter is it IS one of the most original films to come out in the '90s.hollywood loving people will be disappointed in this and call it the worst movie ever, what they don't seem to know is they aren't the only ones seeing movies and with the right to an opinion in the world (thank god!). the problem here is the film doesn't follow a normal story line, which will make these people mad. you aren't told how they got in the cube, and in the end the film-maker doesn't wrap it up for you, letting you wonder and come to your own conclusions.if you like original, tense and tickle-your-brain movies, this is for you. 9/10 (almost a tenner... almost) "},{"Title":"Some of the worst acting and dialogue ever.

There's no real explanation for the goings-on (only a vague X-Files type conspiracy theory), but not a lot of TZ episodes stood up to rational analysis either.You do have to wonder who built this thing, since other than the Cube itself, nothing seems particularly futuristic.There are a few questionable premises.  The implication is that the characters all have skills that contribute to their escape.  Well, first of all the doctor doesn't.  Secondly...this implies this is a deliberate test that particular characters with particular skills were all placed together.  But then we're led to believe the whole thing is random.  So...which is it?There are also some minor nits, like who cleans up all of the many (presumably) bodies that have gone before?  Why does no one clean up Rennes' body, so that it is left behind as a plot point?Some of the math seemed a little shaky to me.  And I wasn't too impressed with the math whiz.  She has to look at a three-digit even number for a couple of second to figure out it isn't prime.  Ummm, hon, if it ends in an even number, it can't be prime.  If it ends in a '5', it can't be prime either, but she actually has to stare at it for a couple of seconds to figure this out??The characters themselves, however, are interesting enough, given that we're not seeing them in the best possible light.  Maurice de Wint, an underrated Canadian actor, probably gives the best overall performance.  His switchover to savagery is a little too abrupt (one second he's saving the doc, the next he drops her) for my tastes.  And the writers can't resist giving him a Jason-like return from the dead sequence.The other characters are an interesting lot.  I wasn't impressed with deBoer (but her talents on DS9 often escaped me as well), but David Hewlett is perfect.Overall, Cube is not your typical film, so going into it expecting a happy ending is probably not a good idea.  It does make you think, though, although its most important issues (Kazam's final escape) are not spoken.

It does not have an ending in which you can sigh of relief and go on with your life. In fact, it does the exact opposite.

They find that they must work as a team to try and figure out how to get out of the maze. Of course, it isn't as straight forward as it first seems as there are thousands of rooms and when the team discover that some rooms are booby trapped, the task of getting out proves to be far more difficult than they ever could have imagined.The 7 protagonists are Leaven (mathematical whizz kid), Quentin (a police officer and self appointed leader), Worth (the man responsible for designing the outside of the cube, but has no knowledge of the inside of the cube) Kazan (a man who is mentally handicapped and also suffering from severe autism - he can work out astronomical sums in his head and is a very similar character to Raymond Babbitt who Dustin Hoffman portrayed in 'Rain Man') Holloway (a doctor) Rennes (a prison escapee) and Alderson (gets killed off in the first 2 minutes - no background info).The main strengths in this film arise from the characters themselves - right from the start there is an immediate sense of paranoia. None of the characters trust each other and you're never quite sure whether all of the characters are genuine or whether certain characters are 'traps' - this is what hooks you in. The very fact that you are never sure is what makes the film interesting and it ultimately makes the characters interesting as well. Although, there are no particularly 'big name' stars in here I felt that all the actors gave believable performances (particular praise should go to Miller in the role of the mentally handicapped/autistic character of Kazan). It's not easy to pull off this type of role convincingly, but I felt that Miller was right on the money and gave a truly brilliant performance. It's quite clear after watching Cube where Wan & Whannell got some of their influence when making the first Saw film - the booby traps, working out puzzles, strangers being trapped in a room together. Both films share similar themes and both of these films are intelligent and exciting.Whilst this film has many strengths and is both intelligent and engaging, there was one major problem; Why were these particular protagonists left in the Cube together?. It's a question that the protagonists ask each other at the start which we never get an answer to. I got subtle hints that some characters were maybe put in there due to areas of expertise (prison escape and mathematical skills) and other characters were placed in there as punishment (such as Quentin with his treatment of his wife and neglecting his kids). But by who and why? We're never given an explanation and that came as a big disappointment as I felt that there was no closure at the end of the film.Despite this gripe, this was a very impressive film. The acting was great, the direction was solid and all of the characters were interesting. The script (for the most part) was intelligent and the film is tense and engaging. It's a solid film that is definitely worth watching.

As a devout Horror fan, my favorite anthology is the Saw series, and watching Cube really give me a clue as to where it got its ideas from.The film has a very short exposition, basically showing us people stuck in the cube. Every room either has a death trap, or doesn't. The prisoners must figure out how to get out, or die trying. The screenplay/story is original, compelling, interesting and exquisitely smart, excellent job by the writers. We even get a few twists, though not really shocking ones, mostly about the group dynamics of the prisoners. Some smarter twists could have really made the film even better. The acting is excellent by the entire cast, all characters are portrayed perfectly. Personally I've been most impressed with Andrew Miller as Kazan. Making a single-location film is always a challenge, to which Cube has stood up in the best way possible.Cube leaves many questions asked, and I doubt the two sequels answer them. The audience is left to wonder, question, and fear. While not exactly a Horror film, Cube is definitely a masterpiece. Very very highly recommended!

The lower quality, mediocre acting, and forgettable dialogue all kind of brought it down for me. However, it does kind of work, because it's about as thought-provoking a made-for-TV movie could possibly get.In terms of characters, none are too memorable. They are at least passable, but the mostly non-memorable dialogue makes them forgettable. And in the end, none are too likable. Although, that is the point.The story was a lot cooler when I first saw it, but on second inspection, it could easily be a Twilight Zone episode. Pretty much, it's about strangers that wake up in a cube. They find other cubes next to it, and they figure out ways of going from cube to cube by reading numbers and going past traps. And it turns out, it's all apart of some big cube that was built by a bunch of people who didn't know what the hell they were doing.And the concept of having strangers wake up in a room? I don't know, but it seems like it's been done before, and therefore making the message a little more obvious. The message, of course, is humans will turn into savages in morbid situations, which has been a somewhat common message ever since Heart Of Darkness and Lord Of The Flies, and probably even before then. Another message, which is slightly less obvious, is only the innocent are good. In this case, it's someone with the mind of a child. (AKA a retard.) As he is the only person to walk into the white light, and get out alive. What could the white light symbolize? Why, heaven, of course! Seems familiar? Same here. That's probably because it's been done before.Although it may seem like I don't like it, I do. It's still an interesting tale, with a message that at least slightly gets me to think. However, it is good when judged by the standards of a TV movie. If you are gonna compare it to some of the great mind-bending movies like The Matrix or 2001 A Space Odyssey, you're gonna get left cold.Overall, a good watch.

Not in one. The truth is, situations like the one we see here usually bring the best in people, not the worst, because their survival instinct then kicks up and makes them huddle together, work as a team, put all their hearts and minds together for the common good. Normally these people would have put everything else aside and focus only in getting out of there. That raises the possibility that the writers here had no idea of the subject they were writing about and that their whole plot may have been inspired by the twisted reality of some of those generic reality shows, which--as we know--have nothing to do with real life and everything to do with some TV producer obsessed with his ratings. A script that seems to have come from someone who has no inkling about how real people behave in emergency situations and who had no other source, experience, than what they had seen in Survivor or in something alike; someone who has no idea of the immense psychological resources we keep at hand for cases like this&#x97;just think of the 33 Chilean miners who survived for 69 days underground, in 2010, in almost complete darkness. It is evident that he characters shown here are not regular, normal people; they behave more like mental patients, even like borderline psychotics. If you think that Cube is a metaphor for life, I pity you, because your life must be really pitiful. As for me, the most logical interpretation I can find for this plot is that all this is happening in an isolation ward, in some mental institution where all these characters have been all put together and where the cubes, and the giant shell surrounding them, are nothing but the outwards projection of their phobias, fantasies, traumas, their own mental prisons. (I could go even further and assume that what's happening here is similar to what we see in Identity, where the different personalities of a single schizophrenic mind act out a particular psychodrama).Let's go beyond the lousy dialogs, the gross overacting, and let's wonder why these people are acting so aggressively towards each other. They are total strangers to each other, yet they treat the rest as if they hated them, as if the others were a nuisance. Furthermore, they are all very confused, mentally, and when it comes to bring to the open the more personal aspects of their usual lives all what they are able to display are phobias, traumas, frustrations, past tragedies and even some conspiratorial obsession that include aliens.(Where is the sheer enjoyment of life here?).So, there is absolutely no positive vibes coming from any of them, except for the Maths girl&#x97;and only when doing her numbers. We may easily conclude that these people have no lives. They have been fetched from their regular existences but we may readily assume that those existences are even emptier than the one they are having here. Like the men lost in the desert in Flight of the Phoenix, they want to go back to their regular lives but there is no hint whatsoever that those lives are in any way enjoyable, worthy of living them.In a perverse sense, the utterly unlikable characters; the terrible dialogs, the depressing atmosphere, the nauseous mood, the regular, perplexing, changes in personal behavior; the lack of logical explanations for their plight; the terrible, brutal, attitude of every one of them towards the rest; the fact that the mental handicapped is the only one coming out in the end--make all the sense in the world. (When the light finally comes and reveals what's inside, only a deranged mind shows up, got it?). It all provides for a plot where every part fit to perfection, in the most logical, consistent, manner. You just have to assume that these are a handful of psychotics who are having the common nightmare of being trapped inside a gigantic Rubik cube. Maybe it's an experiment after all, they were right on that but, if true, it was that of inducing a common dream sequence in them, patients of some mental institution. Or you may consider it as the workings of a single schizophrenic mind, take your pick. If you see it this way, this is a rather good movie and one deserving a 7/10.

That doesn't mean Cube features a lot of kung fu and slow motion special effects. It means that, like The Matrix, this movie tells a gripping and engrossing story which has a lot of philosophical and even theological themes running through it.Cube is about 6 people who wake up in the middle of a death-machine. It's a giant cube made up of individual square rooms. Some of the rooms are safe and some will kill you in horrible ways. These 6 people, who don't know how or why they were put into the cube, have to work together to find their way out&#x85;if such a way even exists. It's a fairly basic plot but it's extremely well executed, leaving you never quite sure exactly what's coming.The meat of the story comes from the interactions of the 6 main characters and the larger social/cultural attitudes they represent. Rennes (Wayne Robson) is a hardened criminal and expert at escaping from prison who only cares about saving his own hide. Quentin (Maurice Dean Witt) is a cop whose aggression and determination both protects and imperils everyone around him. Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a brilliant math student who mostly does what others tell her. Hollway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor and a leftist conspiracy theorist, always ready to blame the powers that be for screwing up everything. Worth (David Hewlett) is an apathetic office worker, the sort of guy who stands apart and watches life pass him by and inside the cube, he'll just stand and watch death run right at him. Kazan (Andrew Miller) is a mentally handicapped man who tests the limits and value of the others' compassion. These 6 characters in this fantastic circumstance are forced to confront the truth about themselves and question everything they believed about their lives and their reality.In addition to the conflicts between the characters and the challenges they have to overcome, Cube also raises broader issues of personal action and the purpose of life. Is this death-machine the deliberate creation of some evil minds or is it simply an idea that ran out of control because no one was willing to take the responsibility of stopping it? Does the cube represent a social order imposed on us by others or it is the product of our own actions and inactions? Is there any aim to how the cube operates or is it all meaningless? Does the way you survive inside the cube say something about the way you should live your everyday life? Is the maker of the cube a benevolent god trying to teach a lesson or a malevolent being who just wants others to suffer?There is uniformly fine acting by the cast, who all manage to give genuine human depth to archetypal roles. The dialog is direct without seeming contrived. The look and sound of the cube itself is tremendously impressive. Many films have spent a lot more money and not come up with anything as visually powerful and suggestive.This is a really entertaining, scary and thought-provoking movie. It's also similar to The Matrix in that Cube spawned two sequels, both of which seemingly didn't understand what made the first film so special and ended up sucking because of that. But no amount of lame ass sequels can take away from the fact that Cube is damn good.

I saw this many years ago and loved it. However, after rewatching it, I feel it definitely deserves a solid eight out of ten stars.Why it lost the full 2 stars (I originally gave it) to drop it to four was just two factors serious overacting at times and the most depressing finale. No, I won't spoil the climax, per se, but you're grasping throughout the movie for an ounce of hope and need something to pick you up. The rug's pulled, so in a sense, you fall instead of rise.That said, and despite the size of the set the actors are all-but exclusively in, I loved the camera work/cinematography. Unlike Saw with its flashbacks &#x96; I think total now 900,000 from the first movie to date (Part VI), this movie shot in the metal rooms had to be a challenge. They did a great job. Also, I love puzzles, and this movie is full of them. Finally, (despite the sequels) I loved not knowing the big picture &#x96; I.E. how the characters came here, who built the place. This placed you in more tension like the cast.Several men and women awake in a puzzle of identical cubes or perfect metallic, square rooms, each side (including floor and ceiling) contains a portal to the next, seemingly similar dungeon. But, beware! There are traps abroad and it's these somewhat unrelated and unwilling participants must decipher a way out, room by room. And they must work together to achieve freedom as they start dying off one by one, each in a new and inventively gruesome manner. (I.E. the Saw reference. Saw's writers Leigh Whannell and James Wan must have got a lot of ideas from watching Cube.) As much as the movie contains suspense in spades, I am super glad they decided not to continue the movie past 90 minutes. It's obviously a two set movie (two cubes built side by side) and though they added depth to the characters, they really could only take this so far.For lovers of suspense, claustrophobic horror, character study, numbers (you'll have to refresh on your math skills before or after) and small, indie films with quality, I would highly recommend this movie.

First, the bad I thought this movie dawdled a little too much on time-passing sequences in which nothing happened, which could have easily been filled up with more of the edgy and dark character-driven tension the rest of the movie so thrived on. A few things seemed a little too convenient, too, like the retarded guy knowing how to square numbers or whatever (this is partially explained by Cube Zero, but that's no excuse; it was poorly written). And I did not think Quentin's character was as believable as it could have been - he switched moods a little too fast.However, everything else about this just rules. It isn't an amazing film, but it is really good, with the acting being surprisingly good (especially compared to Cube Zero) and the drama and tension being extremely well executed. The characters were given distinctive and interesting personalities and were only detailed enough for the story to work. The traps and the gore are well done, as they are not the focal point of the story and don't need to be - we're scared more by what's outside the cube instead of inside it! So this is a great film, immensely entertaining and always keeping you on the edge of your seat, certainly worth watching for fans of horror, science fiction or just gripping, nail-biting suspense in general.

He certainly is an interesting actor. Extremely fit for slick, urbane, ambiguous characters, of subtlety. You see, the script seemed to require for underlined performances verging on overacting&#151;except for Hewlett; him, in part due to the nature of his character, maintains a soberer demure.Before this, I have seen an ulterior installment of the CUBE,one looking more futuristic. This one looks quite industrial, quite rough, like the deliberately worn&#151;out sets of the ALIEN.The first installment, that is, the original one, is hugely suspenseful, relatively well acted (Hewlett is the only distinguished performer), and quite violent. What sets apart THE CUBE is a sort of uncompromising boldness and force&#151;it's not exploitation, it's an ambitiously conceived movie. It's very concept is strong and bold. As a metaphor, it has the sense of keeping understated. It does not look, and, in fact, it is not the existentialist manifesto. If offers, delivers a small portion, a fragment of an unknown set. So that it does not look like the deliberate didactic illustration of a thesis. Such an _absurdist take is very vehement and efficient. Do not patronize the audience, let them get only a fragment.Fast&#151;paced, this thriller is wise in not pretending being able to say more about its characters than it's possible at such a pace. Some of them are merely sketched; others, are deepened. This depends on the performers, too. Such movies are less riddles, and more shocks, punches. THE CUBE is relatively smart; but it's good that it does not turn out being too smart. Because its strength is its fundamental honesty. It's very scale is intended as small, unassuming and fragmentary; at least, this is how I figure it. I liked the fact that it seemingly did not attempt to force one take it for what it's not .At certain turning points, the script is unafraid of taking unexpected decisions.

When they realize that there's traps inside certain rooms, and that the rooms are all apart of a gigantic cube, they begin to wander through to safety. As they wind their way through, they start to realize a distinct pattern through the way the cubes are designed, which they believe is useful in getting out. Finding Kazan, (Andrew Miller) also stuck inside with them, they find that the numbers are getting lower due to the fact that they keep wandering into traps, which leads them to the secret that could lead them out of the deadly contraption.The Good News There's almost nothing worthwhile about this one. One of the main reasons to see this one is the first two kills to this. There's a couple of them spread throughout, but the very first ones are the most important. The first one is really impressive and incredibly gory, which is just the right way to get the film going off to a great start. The next one is another really brutal one and actually has some really great moments in the set-up for it, which is a nice twist that produces a fun kill. The only other area that works to this is the way it handles the character's transition, which is done nicely and comes off rather well and as surprising. These here are all that work for this one.The Bad News This one had a couple problems with it. The main one is that there's hardly anything going on in here. There's an extreme avoidance of the traps in here merely because it decides to focus on the rather annoying habit of having everyone yell at each other for trying to solve the riddles or just plain doing math to begin with. There's not a whole lot of exciting scenes of people yelling math solutions at each other, and that this takes up the entire middle segment of the film, lasting close to the hour mark, and these really start to take a toll on the film. At the end, these simply use up the time that could've been spent on luring those into the traps, the real reason for this one. Seeing only a couple fall to traps and most of the time ignoring them is something that doesn't sit well at all, ruining the film of it's main attraction and completely undoes most of the good it had, what little there was to start with. These are the film's biggest flaws.The Final Verdict Not a whole lot to really say about this one, some good things and a couple flaws, but nothing that really sticks out. If you have to see this one, then do so as well as fans of the others in the series, though those looking for something other than what this provides should ignore altogether.Rated R Graphic Language and Graphic Violence "}{"Title":"A metaphorical nightmare","Date":"16 September 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Imagine... you wake up in an unfamiliar, almost alien, place with no recollection of how you got there.

The rest of it is up to the viewers and the keen ones will undoubtedly notice many hints beneath the surface narrative as to what is going on, but in the end, this is best seen as a metaphorical nightmare. Whether it is one that H.P. Lovecraft would have or one that George Orwell would have is really beside the point and it can easily be seen either way or even both at the same time. It is that lack of explanation in a well made film that can render it powerfully symbolic on many levels. It is a nightmare that scares many people and scares each one in their own way. Interestingly it is not really the film that scares you directly, it scares you indirectly. It is your own mind that scares or better yet, frightens, you as it searches for possible answers as the protagonists search for essentially the same thing.Cube is so effective, because it pulls you right into what is going on screen.

That is certainly the case here.The set is fairly straightforward. It's a sort of prison-cell with trapdoor openings in all of the walls, ceiling and floor. Each gives access to a seemingly identical cell which may be illuminated in a different colour. That obviously keeps production costs to a minimum as one set fits all. In fact, the cells are not quite identical. Some contain the most diabolical booby-traps imaginable.A group of inmates, or guinea-pigs wake and find themselves inside this grotesque maze and it becomes evident that their combined skills and abilities are their potential salvation. They work from cube to cube attempting to discover how to escape. It should also be mentioned that each cube is part of a complex in which they frequently move like a colossal Rubic Cube.Naturally, tempers fray and conflicts develop. This is especially so when those who think they are inevitably suited to leadership and command, find that in truth they have little to offer, and instead the least likely members are the more needful. It's a clever little observation about human behaviour, but which is not very well evaluated or explored. The script and acting are all a tad stagy, but the oddness of the whole situation still carries the movie forward and the viewer watching.There is no explanation or overview to their plight or the nature of the hell in which they are plunged, and this may disappoint those who like things cleared-up at the end.

I've heard many good things about the movie CUBE throughout the years, so I decided to give this one, it's prequel & it's sequel a try. I saw CUBE ZERO before seeing this & found it a fascinating movie & the original CUBE is even better, the acting is really strong & the direction pretty good as well, Director VINCENZO NATALI has created a very tense, claustrophobic environment for his film & never bores his audience by always offering something new & several neat plot twists. Highly recommended by those bored by more current Hollywood product, CUBE is a breath of fresh air & very inventive. Definitely recommended especially if you liked TWILIGHT ZONE. Followed by a sequel CUBE 2 HYPERCUBE & a prequel CUBE ZERO.**** stars "},{"Title":"Mindf*ck","Date":"13 January 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Thats the only way to describe this movie.

The film survives on its interesting premise and great acting. If I had one complaint it would be that the film repeats itself a lot....going to each room for an hour and a half or so is quite tedious and also the movie felt a little long.

It becomes apparent, that these questions will never get answered (unless you watch the sequel, and prequel, which are highly dissatisfying) Cube is known as a Science-Fiction movie, but some people don't realise that it is more of a character study. As the film progresses, we are shown different characters, and how their situation shifts and changes them, until our own views we had at the beginning are completely transformed.So, in conclusion, if you have not seen this film, i highly recommend it.

It deals with a couple of people each with their own specific talent imprisoned in a world of deadly rooms. The many boobytraps hidden in each cube are enough to alarm even the bravest person and they soon begin to lose their patience as well as their hope in getting their lives back.The entire movie is basically one huge mission to make it out of the huge cube alive. The fact that each room has a devious trap in store and the wide diversity of the many characters make up for a very enjoyable movie. Every now and then you are presented with unusual camera shots which adds to the already creepy atmosphere. The movie begins for example with a close-up shot of someone's eye. Near the end you do happen to have the feeling that you've seen everything and any presentation of a new room actually feels more like a stretch than an interesting plot development. Fortunately they don't drag the movie on for too long and the ending has an okay twist.Being a low-budget movie in Canada, one might expect that Cube doesn't have a single famous actor. Not to worry, because all acting is quite good. There are at least two performances that are worth mentioning here. Maurice Dean Wint plays the part of Quentin the cop and he's quite good. The best acting however is by Andrew Miller who plays the role of Kazan the autistic man. Andrew Miller is no Dustin Hoffman so don't expect a Rainman-performance, but his acting is easily the best thing alongside the eerie atmosphere and originality of this beautiful thriller.In short If you want proof that good movies don't always come from millions of dollars - check this one out! It's as good as any low-budget movie could ever be!

The feeling of claustrophobia engendered by the seemingly endless series of cubes becomes quite palpable. There are, of course, traps to be avoided, or the film would have become very boring very quickly, and the idea is that all the characters need to combine their skills in order to find their way out. The idea is unusual and bursts with promise (If you can endure the characters occasionally becoming uncharacteristically verbose), then it begins to unravel...It won't be long before the word 'Rubic's' springs to mind. Certainly you'll catch on much faster than the characters involved, and since the idea is that the characters should assist one another you are soon left wondering what skill the very first victim of the cube might have had, since he dies before meeting any of the other participants, and although it isn't stipulated how long the survivors slept for, it seems unlikely that they were in the cube for more than maybe a day, so why, having reached the exit, does one of them panic because he's suddenly scared of the outside and wants to remain where he feels safe? (Safe? With no food or water?... Duh.). Since no tools or weapons were allowed in the cube, where does the crazy cop suddenly get his spike from? If the entrances make so much noise, how does he sneak in to a cube without anyone noticing? and how does he get the young girl out? Then there's the ending... It's really a little depressing that such an involving and well thought out movie can be spoilt by a mind-bendingly idiotic conclusion, but unfortunately that's it.

Still, the overall effect is very good, and the film (rather surprisingly) stands up well to repeat viewings, too.  It's not so much that the paranoid premise is appealing (though it is), but rather that director Vincenzo Natali really seems to understand how to pace this peculiar drama of his.  It's hard to imagine another film essentially set in a single room that manages to pull the rug out from us so often.  From the prologue on, we are presented with shocks and twists that keep our allegiances shifting from character to character, and our rumps balanced uncomfortably on the edge of our seats.  The design and lighting are more than striking, and if in the end things don't make a whole lot of sense, one gets the impression that that was never the director's aim in the first place.

To me the film makes some very obvious points, some delivered more subtly than others. And those are very relevant points.The most obvious message is of course that we need each other to get by through life, although our own spiritual qualities are the only thing we can rely on in the end. Another is that you shouldn't judge a book by the cover, as illustrated by the development of Worth, Quentin and of course Kazan.But the most crucial point is the one delivered in the final scene The meek shall inherit the earth. Kazan is a child, but a wise child. He is the one who has been closest to the solution all the time, simply by not going anywhere. He is the only one remaining untainted by the suspicion, hatred and retribution which ultimately destroys his companions.You may see the characters as representatives of different ways of life. You have Randomness (Alderson), Cunning (the Wren), Strength (Quentin), Knowledge (Worth), Reasoning (Leaven) and Compassion (Holloway). Each one of these is flawed and/or incomplete, and thus doomed to perish. They can compensate for each other weaknesses, but without Enlightenment (Kazan), they are all meaningless. Kazan is the weakest, obviously, but being dependent on others is also his largest strength. The last becomes the first. The fool becomes the sage.Anyway, that's my truth. Tell me yours.

Contains minor spoilers.First, I'd like to point out that whether the movie is a cult classic as some claim, or torturous drivel as others claim, it was nonetheless stimulating enough that 434 people have felt compelled to comment on it, despite it being a no-budget, independent Canadian film made in 20 days some 6 years ago. That should count for something on the worth seeing scales, whether you ultimately wind up loving or hating it.I really liked it. Those who say it's flawed have some justification. However, it's not as flawed as Toys, for example. I also don't feel that the flaws are as critical to the coherency of the film as some did. I found this movie quite tense, and I'm still thinking about the issues it raised a day later, which I haven't done too often since Se7en.The plot summary is readily available, so I'll move on.The non-ending was not a flaw in my opinion. Cube reminds me of The Quiet Earth (a favorite) in that way. I loved that the light beyond the last door clearly implies somewhere else, because it's *different*, which is an extraordinary relief by that time. But there's no indication if it's normal daylight or simply the illumination of the outer shell, which might contain only new puzzles/traps, and no exit.Many complained about the 'stereotypical characters'. I felt that this was a logical extension of the basic idea.The characters have been suddenly and inexplicably thrust into an environment so unfamiliar and featureless that the only element that provides any context at all is the other humans. Like Rennes, who can at least identify a prison and provide valuable advice about escaping one.They're also in completely unexpected, urgent, mortal peril. They must instantly redirect their frame of reference to a guerilla mentality and move quickly and undetected through an uncharted, dangerous area, where a single mistake is fatal. Only Quentin and Rennes are used to such a swift and radical paradigm shift and might resist disorientation to some extent. But even they would normally know how they went from being safe to being unsafe, and would have some idea what the rules of engagement were. No one knows that, in the Cube.Disorienting and stressful seems an inadequate description of this situation. Humans focus on the familiar to cope with disorientation. There's nothing familiar in the world, so each must rely on previously-developed strategies for making a chaotic world comprehensible. However, it's clear that these people were not particularly successful in comprehending the real world, even before the Cube. No surprise, then, that their compensating strategies consist of trite, simplistic world-views, which ring even more hollow than usual under these conditions. This is likely the root of the idiotic dialogue complaint. I was so anxious during Cube that I took off my headphones a few times, and didn't hear every word of dialogue, but it definitely wasn't as bad as some of Danny DeVito's lines in Batman Returns. I'd say that Cube's hackneyed contrivance meter averaged at about the Star Wars A New Hope level, but here I think the idiocy of the dialogue was perhaps somewhat intentional.I noticed, when Holloway called Quentin a Nazi, that every cultural association that popped into my head to explain why that word is insulting either made me miss what the characters missed, or distracted me from the concept/goal of escape. War (people!), history (irrelevant), Europe (Earth!), fascism (government? won't help, responsible?), religion (God??!!! definitely not helping)...  Abstractions and metaphors are meaningless inside the Cube. Why does Holloway think she has brainpower to spare for them? How could Quentin take the insult to heart as if personal judgements mattered, as if *anything* mattered but getting out, and freely walking a single step without risking poor Alderson's fate? Then I realized-- this distracting pseudo-relevance was their only defense against overwhelming horror and despair in a nearly-hopeless and essentially meaningless situation.The character Quentin displayed this fundamental desperation most clearly, even if Maurice Dean Wint's acting is sometimes a bit over the top.As for the math issue-- hey, maybe Leaven's not a super-genius. Some people train for years, but still achieve only mediocrity in their chosen field. She's also hungry, thirsty, exhausted, terrified, and disoriented. Could even a super-genius quickly do complex, life-critical math under those circumstances (without being autistic)? Later developments with her abilities seemed fairly reasonable because she began by grouping the numbers into 3 sets of 3 digits, then appeared to need to solve the full 9-digit numbers, but I'm no math whiz. Maybe her brain gave out because she was hungry, thirsty, exhausted, terrified, and disoriented. That's possible, too. I found the autistic math genius too convenient, but felt the character ultimately served a worthwhile function in the setup.It was easy to guess accurately when something was about to happen, but not so easy to be accurate about just what. And the last twist actually caught me off-guard despite being the oldest trick in the book, probably for the same reason it caught the characters off-guard. I was captivated by the light.The characters weren't interesting or sympathetic, except Leaven (I just like Nicole de Boer, from her work on Star Trek Deep Space 9). I did want them to get out, though. Not even Ally McBeal deserves to die in the Cube, and I really dislike her. It was interesting that I still found this movie compelling despite being indifferent to the characters and expecting many of the plot points.If I had to guess the theme of this film, I'd say that Cube is a speculation as to what rats in a lab might be thinking when they are placed in some featureless maze for reasons unknown/meaningless to them, and attempt to achieve whatever uncertain reward the unseen controller has (or has not) placed somewhere within. And despite its flaws, Cube manages to convey that.That's a heck of an achievement.

It just goes to show you don't need big-name talent from Hollywood to make a good film.  Shot in Canada? People I've never heard of?  Who cares - I've heard of George Lucas and Star Wars, but his latest entries has made this fan abandon the force.  After viewing Cube I think Lucas needs to move to Canada and find what he lost 20 years ago.I didn't think anyone made films like this anymore.  I thought the day of good low budget horror took a fatal blow in the 70s, slowly dying out in the 80s and 90s.  All the low-budget franchises have gained a significant budget now (not Matrix 2 huge, but way larger than Halloween's $300k) and all the horror films still operating on a tiny budget are too deliberately campy for me to enjoy.  But here we have proof that good horror can be made on a shoe-string.  Granted I have a number of reasons to not like Cube, I found the film rather charming and intriguing.Despite the set consisting of one room made to look like an entire maze, it succeeds in never boring the viewer.  The cube has a very raw, industrial, and enigmatic feel in the same vein as the original Alien film's set only here we have cubic rooms with monochromatic lighting appropriately color coded with the walls, giving each room its own flavor and atmosphere. It's actually one of the better uses of color onscreen that I've seen, and it's an extremely simple effect seamlessly integrated into the plot.As simple as the set and its lighting is, it's more convincing than the vast amounts of CG that fills the Star Wars prequels and thus easier to get into Cube's world.  With Star Wars you needed the force to believe the videogame graphics all around was more than an ILM pleasure cruise.  But here the actors can actually touch and interact appropriately with their set.I've read a number of complaints about the acting, and took a bit of amusement reading Muskewitz's comments at E-Film Critic where he states he'd like to see the film remade Gus Van Sant-esque and just replace the actors .. . and immediately my mind again jumped to the big-budget films Star Wars I & II.  I definitely have to disagree with him and the number of people who gripe about the film's acting.  While not the greatest performances in the history of Sci-fi, I still found the characters and their portrayals superior to the later Star Wars cast (with the exception of Ian McDiarmid and an elite handful of others).The characters themselves, while borderline cliché with its diversity in their backgrounds - a collection of people from all places of society to be slaughtered - it didn't bother me like HyperCube's characters did.  The writers used just enough restraint to never push their characters over the line and again monotony was cleverly used to tone down the cliché factor. All the characters are dressed the same so we rely more on their physical appearance and personality to reveal who they are versus `Okay, she's dressed like a geek.  She's formal.  He's a bum.  That guy's a loser.'  So now we have real characters, some more fleshed out than others, but now we have a reason to worry if the traps kill someone.And then there's something I really appreciate - a film with a premise but no explanation.  Some call it a cheat, others call it a cop-out, I call it `Not cramming every major plot point in simpleton idiotic terms so the average moron can understand.'  Finally, a movie that doesn't kill itself with explanation after explanation.  Finally a film that lends itself to the audience's imagination.  Orson Welles once said, `Give the audience too much and they won't contribute anything themselves.  Give them just a suggestion and you get them working with you.  That's what gives the theatre its meaning when it becomes a social act.'  If you enjoy being talked down to and everything explicitly written out, don't even bother with Cube.Besides, not one character in the film is ever in a position to know anything about the Cube.  The film obeys its own logic, pulls no punches in its reasoning, in that regard, and I found it refreshing having a movie where no one truly knows anything concrete.  The writers didn't stoop to the half-ass conceived `Someone just happens to have the answers to the universe in this group and is 100% right.  What a coincidence!'  Every explanation is conjectural and abstract at best.  It goes for a more realistic approach. And really, if you're stuck in a booby trapped Cube, do you need to know everything about its origin to try and save your ass and get out?  Cube gives you what you need and goes from there.  I also liked how the characters depend on trial and error since most revelations on how to escape end up as a failure to include all variables.  They don't just magically have the answer.In the end, Cube succeeds in building atmosphere and suspense quite impressively given what it had to work with.  While not without its disappointing moments (usually when they do bend to Hollywood formulas), Cube is a triumph of low budget craftsmanship.  I hope Natali proves to be more than a one-hit wonder, because I'd love to see more films like Cube.

Each person has a skill needed to escape from the mysterious cube, which is filled with booby-trapped rooms.  So I give the film some credit for simply attempting to create such a neat idea.And I thought that the filmmakers created the cube itself quite nicely, especially as they were on a low budget.  Even though the film is almost entirely confined inside rather smallish, cube-like rooms, I really didn't get tired of looking at the same set again and again.  Another commendation I can give to the film is that I truely did feel the suspense, the sense of paranoia, etc.  At least I was entertained.But the movie is deeply flawed.  First off, the acting is poor. Considering that the only thing to look at for 95% of this movie is the acting, I'd say this is a serious problem.  Not to say the actors had tons to work with, since the script itself wasn't so good.  The whole mathematical premise that the cube is based upon is rather shaky -- if it actually DOES make sense, then it is explained very poorly and clunkily.  And the ending was a big let-down.  Terribly disappointing, and it really didn't make so much sense.Also, I went into watching Cube thinking there would be some kind of dawning and horrible realization as to what the cube's really was.  This is never adequately explained in the movie.  Rather than focusing on the nature of the cube itself, the film centers almost entirely on the breakdown of the characters inside the cube, with some nifty traps going off and killing or hurting people in neat ways every so ofter.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing -- it's just not what I expected.  And it's also kind of tough to pull off without really bang-up acting, which I reiterate, this film did NOT have.Cube is some fun, but a let-down.  If the plot really intrigues you and you think you can get past all these flaws that I've mentioned, knock yourself out and rent the movie.  Otherwise, you'd probably best just stay away.

Some of it stands out in stark contrast to the professionalism of  the rest of the film.  The actor who played Quentin has a few particularly stagey  moments. His crazy-eyed stare could've been taken down a few notches and been more effective.  He tries so hard to act insane; it feels like acting.  But those are only a few  moments.

It's a terrifying thought that innocent people can be taken from their own homes in the middle of the night and transported to such a cruel and devilishly sophisticated experiment. You wonder who could have the power to do such a thing the characters speculate, government, a Bond style supervillain? but they never can find out for sure, no evil genius ever presents himself and indeed it would be a total letdown if they did. The main character in the story is the implacible Cube itself, an endless 3D maze of 14ft-on-a-side cubic rooms each with 6 exits to ajacent rooms (including ceiling and floor). There are no windows of course and each room is lit by its glowing walls. Different rooms have different colours, red, blue, green and white and this brilliantly adds to the eerie feel and look of the film. Each coloured room has an atmosphere of its own, the white ones of definitely the most cheery, its as bright as daylight and you can see the colours clearly but there is no guarantee that a white room doesn't contain a trap, in fact there seems to be no correspondance between colours and traps, that would be too easy.But there is a way to get through the maze, each room has a number written along its edges and its possible to work out a way out from that, provided you have enough mathematical ability. The cube is already mathematical in terms of being such an ideal geometric structure and this number theory twist adds greatly to the intrigue. It involves the audience as they try to solve the puzzle themselves and also gives the characters something to do. Some of the characters - is it coincidence - do have mathematical ability.There are five characters in the film, as you might expect they are an eclectic bunch with more than usual amounts of emotional problems and eccentricities. Imagine waking up in a cubic room with nothing but identical rooms all around! After coping with the shock and rising terror, the characters set off to find a way out and naturally different personalities start to assert themselves. Some characters are natural leaders others are more thoughtful. Some hopeful of a way out, others just despair accepting death as inevitable. It turns out that one if tangentially responsible for building the cube in the first place adding to the paranoid feeling that NO ONE IS SAFE.The acting in this film is excellent, you really believe in the whole cube concept from the start. The actors really make you feel how frightening and disorienting it would be and there is superbly believable and fascinating interactions between them as they each find their place in this frightened little group. Although they cope well there is throughout a sense of underlying tension, a feeling of just-controlled panic, which is exactly how you would feel in that situation! There is good character development too as the movie goes on and we find out more about each character's lives and personalities.The directing and cinematography of the film are superb, the whole concept of Cube is just amazing and the visuals do full justice to it. The look of the film is reminiscent of Kubrick at his most spooky and disorienting. There is one scene in particular where the characters are trying to get though a sound-activated trap. One by one they crawl through it in total silence gesturing to each other. I was scared to make any sound myself, it was completely electric! It takes a daring director to have five minutes of silence in a film and this really paid off. It reminded my particularly of 2001 EVA scenes.If I have a complaint at all it is about the ending. I wont reveal it of course, but I would have prepared something happier. After all they've been through, I would have preferred to see the characters succeed, especially cynical worth and the mathematical girl, they really deserved to get out. I would have rewritten the last few seconds, but nothing else.The 3D maze known as Cube is a work of evil genius created by persons of institutions unknown. I would say this film is also a work of genius, not evil but certainly terrifying, disturbing and deeply moving. I would definitely recommend it, but be prepared for some sleepless nights... (and an obsessive interest in prime numbers!)

The picture it paints of humanity is very dark, ugly, and disturbing.  But it contains far too many elements of truth to be dismissed.  This is one of the very few movies ever to give me insomnia. I was badly shaken.CUBE's plot is simple.  A handful of strangers wake up inside a strange machine, a sort of maze consisting of 14-foot cubical rooms, some of which contain deadly, sadistic traps.  They have no idea how they came here, or what the place is for.  The story is simply of their efforts to survive and escape from the maze.  But a darker story is told simultaneously, as the growing tension and strain strip away the veneer of each character to expose what lies below.  A character who initially appears useless and annoying turns out to have hidden courage; a character who at first seems heroic is revealed to be anything but.The tragedy of CUBE is the energy the characters spend in conflict with each other when they so clearly need to work together to overcome the daunting obstacles of the maze.  The mismatched-partners concept is old, of course, but in most movies it is played for humor; in CUBE, it is shown as deadly.  The story is a microcosm of the human predicament.  Humans understand what they are doing in this world little (if any) better than the characters understand what they are doing in the Cube.  Our planet is full of dangers that can and eventually do kill every one of us, just as the Cube is.  Yet, humans the world over continue to fight each other instead of cooperating to understand and overcome the problems the world throws at us.  That behavior is so routine that most of us have long since ceased to notice it or think it odd; by showing it in miniature, CUBE puts the absurdity of our actions in sharp focus.Another foolish human habit exposed by CUBE is the characters' tendency to reason from inadequate evidence to whatever conclusion fits their preconceived notions, a failing which proves as dangerous in the movie as it does in real life.The criticisms you have read about CUBE's mathematical implausibilities are true.  They certainly make the movie imperfect, but I don't see how they can be regarded as ruining it.  At any rate, CUBE presents one mathematical statement that brooks no argument (and here there is a SPOILER).  The Cube is one of the ghastliest, cruelest killing machines ever conceived, and yet when the carnage is totaled up at the end of the story, the score is Humans 4, Cube 2.

The premise is fairly simple, as you will have gathered. 6 strangers trapped in a series of interlocking cubes, each has a skill that could help get them out.A lot of messages on this board whine on about the lack of ending, the fact that nothing is explained. But that is the beauty of this film, that things don't have to BE explained. It doesn't matter why or how or whatfor. I personally hate being walked through films holding on to the director's hand. I would much rather think about what the film told ME. What I made from the events. There are so many hidden depths in this film that some of the reviews barely even touched on. The main one being philosophy - and the fact that each character represents a different aspect of it. Take Leaven who belongs to the Epistemology branch - the philosophy of knowledge. She reasons the cube as a mathematical puzzle and that by knowing the rules, they can get out. Each character attaches a different meaning to the cube and it in turn affects their relationship with it.If you didn't like this film, then go back to your Scream or I Know What You Did...

Canadians can make horror movies? Apparently they can. What sets this movie apart from American horror movies is character development. And by that, I mean the characters ACTUALLY develop. Watching Resident Evil or I Know What you did Last Summer, I realize we never find out anything interesting about the characters. But I was ok with that, as the characters in those movies are wholly uninteresting. Cube is different. There are no real heroes. All the characters have good and bad qualities. They succeed and they fail. Some live, some die. The movie doesn't feel the need to keep the plot moving by killing someone off in a really gross way every 5 minutes. The first scene alone is gruesome enough to hold us the whole movie. Also, worth noting is the great score to the movie. And by great, I dont mean fantastic musical numbers. The score is very subtle yet very creepy. Just creaks and quiet rumbles and singular notes held for great lengths.

It's always a pleasure to view a low-budget film that excels in different areas and becomes a cult following. Cube not only touches your psyche, but also keeps you on the edge and makes you ask many questions along the way and even after the film is over. The movie simply throws you into the plot with no explanation as to how the people got into this giant cube or why. Even the characters don't truly know why they are there or who put them there. Most of them simply know that they were doing something prior to waking up in this cube. That along is a scary thought. All they know is that there is danger in some of the adjacent rooms that can instantly kill them. Some of them have already seen the traps and survived. As the small society discusses their options and there reasons for being there, they soon discover that each person holds a knowledgeable key for escaping. With no food or water, time isn't on their side and only a strong body, mind and the will to live will keep them moving toward their goal of escaping. To tell you much more about the film would totally ruin the surprises and there are many surprises along the way. Some of them are shocking, while others are questionable. The ending is a bit of a shocker and many viewers will be scratching their heads and staring at the screen in awe. This film definitely deserves a sequel and one was actually made called Hypercube. From the reviews I've read, it's basically the same as the first film with different characters and a few twists. None of the questions are answered from the first film, so maybe there will be a 3rd sequel in the near future that will explain EVERYTHING. That would be nice. Listen to what the other reviewers have said about this film and then go out and rent it. You have to see this film at least once. It's totally original and the script was very well written. The actors actually do a decent job even though most of them don't show much depth or chemistry.Overall the movie is a suspenseful thrill ride that's worth viewing. You'll never know what's going to happen next. There are times when the film drags alone with not much happening, but confrontations seem to be around every corner. Let's hope a 3rd film is made that will clear up questions about the CUBE and all it's mysteries.

Somehow these individuals were not chosen by random to enter the maze, in some way they each carry one piece of the puzzle, all they have to find out is just what these pieces are and how to use them.I thought this film created a pretty real sense of fear all the way through. It gives your mind a little spin. That said it is far from perfect. I believe the idea is very interesting, but it could have been even better executed with better actors and a bigger budget. The character chemistry does not live up to the smart qualities of the original idea of the film, and occasional events are cliche'.

I look forward to cube 2,which is set to be finished in 2002,but I have heard that it has no relations with cube 1.Maybe it will give us more answers.Even though this movie kind of a mystery and left you wondering about a lot of things,I still loved it.Maybe the reason was that it made you think about human nature and that some situations can make humans capable of almost anything.

Even though it's obvious that the entire movie was shot in a single set, Natali, cinematographer Derek Rogers, editor John Sanders, and production designer Jasna Stefanovic do an excellent job to simulate a massive, geometrically precise prison.The philosophical angle, though, in which the prisoners represent a tiny cross-section of society and each has secrets and special knowledge is a total crock. Natali and his co-writers have lead ears for dialogue and a totally false sense of existential social commentary. They aren't helped by a cast that feels only a step up from student films (which, to some extent, this is, I guess). The characters are collectively annoying and the individual performances do nothing to make the characters any more complex.There's a abusive cop, a paranoid doctor, an office worker, a math student, and a caricature of an autistic man (and anybody who's ever seen a cinematic representation of autism will be able to guess what his special skill is). They're in a 14-by-14 cube with 6 doors. One door leads to a safe room, the others to torture and death. They have no food and no water and they don't know each other, so wouldn't you know that tensions would run high.At its best, Natali produces a masterful amount of suspense. The booby-trapped rooms are wonderfully devised to produce disgusting results. And since the characters don't know if sound, body heat, or their mere presence will be enough to set off the traps, there's much fun to be had with the concept. The film's best sequence involves a sound sensitive room where the slightest noise produces a wall of spikes. The production team uses colored lights, askew camera angles, and tricky editing to create the contrast between rooms.But the film really has nowhere to go. The ending is a letdown largely because Natali left himself nowhere to go. Since you don't care about the characters, their fates are irrelevant and since the purpose, location, and meaning of the Cube are intentionally ambiguous, any resolution would really feel like a cheat.Cube has been compared fairly frequently to Pi, as mathematical thrillers. Like Cube's philosophy, though, the mathematics aren't as smart as the filmmakers seem to think. There's no intellectual process because only two characters have any mathematical knowledge, so their discoveries aren't organic, they're of the Oh. Why didn't I think of that two reels ago variety. Unlike Pi, there's no real conceptual mystery to unravel and the various solutions are just a little too convenient.Because of Cube's limited resources and the levels on which it does succeed, I'm going to give it a 6/10. I admired the mechanical artistry, but wished the movie had more depth.

It turned out to be a gripping suspense all the way through. The movie was written based on a clever concept that mixes psychology, math and socio-politics criticism. Furthermore, the Cube was filmed as a multi-layered narration. On one level it tells the story of six people imprisoned within a labyrinth of compartments in the shape of cubes. Each compartment had been designed and assembled according to mathematical formula based on a 3-D cube. All six 'prisoners' have to work together using each of his/her skills/knowledge in order to find the exit, before they die trapped within. It is interesting to see how each person contribute their 'knowledge' to decipher the planted 'map' and trying to survive some booby-trapped compartments and threats from themselves. Just like stated by one of the 'prisoners', RennesYou've gotta  save yourselves from yourselves. That line itself is a direct message of the second level of the movie social criticism. I felt that the movie's pacing and characters' dialogues truly built up the tension, as the audience and the characters are progressively swallowed by a claustrophobic sense. But the real kick of the movie is the message of the story. Basically what the writers are saying is that, so long as the people of our 'modern' society is segregated into myriad 'professional working fields' (for example) and each section doesn't want to know how they are connected or need each other, we all will always live like prisoners inside the 'system'. A system that is getting out of control, as each individual is too busy with his/her own life. That kind of ignorance will eventually breaks down all social orders and kill the people who the system suppose to protect, as it did in the movie. The 'system' has become the prison, represented as the cube inside the movie.The acting may seem rather flat and the characters are eventually two dimensional, since 90 minutes is not a lot of time to build a strong background for each character or the nature of the cube itself. But you can still enjoy the suspense, good interaction, disturbing settings and ponder upon the message.

Luckily it's been released by now both on video as well as on DVD.The story involves a group of people that wake up in a construction made up only of cubes. They don't know how or why they ended up there except that they better get out since their captors didn't see fit to supply them with either food or drink. Each cube on each side is connected to another one and some can be entered safely, while others contain deadly booby traps of diverse nature, a fact pointed out to the viewer already in the spectacular opening scene. To put it mildly it is a risky undertaking that awaits the characters of mixed plumage and they'll need each other badly to complete their journey, if they can that is, which naturally I won't divulge.The relationships between the characters are fascinating and include surprising developments that perhaps sometimes seem a bit far fetched and over the top, but they do raise the suspense in this low budget movie. The movie looks, especially in view of the low costs, very well and suspense is kept up right until the end.As a first, this movie by Canadian director Vincenzo Natali shows great talent. For what it's worth, I'd recommend it to any horror/sci-fi afficionado.

Made on a wafer-thin budget for this type of movie ($365K Canadian -- approx. $240K US), it manages to tell a good story with unknown actors, and a single cubical set (which I read was one 14'x14' set only made to look like different cubes by changing the colors of the tiles), it is simply amazing. But the real concept behind the story is two-fold.  I read a review on another movie site that explained the characters perfectly.  The characters represent our society and the cube represents system, and these characters have one of these qualities the leader-turn-domineering controller (Quentin); the insider who knows about, but refuses to give up any information about the system (Worth); the paranoid who gets into other peoples' business for their own satisfaction (Holloway); the pushover scholar who easily follows others orders (Leaven); the careless, represented by a mentally challenged character, who knows nothing but could give a crap about the system and never will (Kazan); and the fugitive who wants nothing and will think of nothing but escaping the system with no one's help (the uncredited guy at the beginning, and also Rennes).  I think that this explanation says that each group has an ability, but a disability that inevitably counteracts with their ability and makes it that much harder to beat the system, the cube.The other concept that this movie toys with is math.  Since my favorite subject in school is math, I was interested in how it was incorporated into the movie.  With the help of Leaven, mathematics becomes a vital part of the escape.  I understood some, but others was too complicated (Cartesian coordinates, powers of primes???), but it made it that much interesting, as well.After I saw the movie, I heard that a follow-up to this movie was being made as we speak -- Cube 2 Hypercube.  It won't be a sequel, yet it will deal with the concept of hypercubes which only exist in the 4th dimension, which is a real theory.  That will definitely be a mindboggler...can't wait! Otherwise, as we wait, this movie needs to be publicized, instead of the 90% of the high-budget, starring-famous-actors-who-can-act movies being made today.  9.5/10 "},{"Title":"Enigmatic sci-fi/horror and for the most part very effective","Date":"24 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  A very interesting premise.

Like many other horrorfilms, the intensity of the beginning is never quite reached again, but almost. If it has one big flaw, it is that none of the characters are very likable. The supposed hero turns out to be a murderous creep and our young heroine is quite obnoxious for most of the time. The ending may be good for some, but I felt it was a bit of a cheat.

The stark setting, the inescapable frustration of a thoroughly unexplained situation and the very human actions of the characters makes this a singularly powerful piece of psychological cinema. A cop, a doctor, an architect, a prisoner, a brilliant math student and an intellectually disabled man wake to find themselves imprisoned in a cube-shaped room with a single door in each wall. All complete strangers, none of them know why they are there, how they got there, what purpose the structure has nor who built it. To work their way through the puzzle, they have to survive the fiendish traps hidden randomly throughout, like the acid jets which burn off one guy's face and the invisible razor mesh which reduces another inmate to a pile of square-shaped chunks in the opening sequence. Once they slowly discover what's going on, even if they don't know why, avoiding the traps turns out to be the easy part as their own psychological breakdowns caused by their unique and inexplicable circumstances prove to be the deadliest obstacle of all. This is a tense, claustrophobic and sadistic science fiction thriller in which the main enigmas of who and why are never revealed, given even more impact in light of the subsequent rise in popularity of voyeuristic TV shows like 'Survivor'.

Throw in a few humans totally oblivious of the nature of the system, and you have a great setup for either a hot action flick or a depressing psychological drama. The creators of Cube took the latter approach, which made it possible to make the movie on the incredibly low budget, but also required them to come up with interesting characters, where they fell somewhat short.While the low budget didn't allow a real visual feast, the scenes look surprisingly good, with very few flaws, this setup was more than adequate to support the character interplay.Some commentary on the story (SPOILERS!) With such a special environment, it would have been nice to have some more extraordinary characters. With one exception they were over-stereotyped. I can see a point in that, they were supposed to be a well-selected team of ordinary people, but it was easy to guess their next moves. Quentin's madness was a nice touch, the way he cracked under pressure was well displayed, especially the turning point, when he risked his neck to save Halloway, then let her fall a few seconds later. But the bloodbath at the end was unnecessary, I really don't see what they tried to accomplish with that (or if I do, I don't like it).Most importantly, I have no problem with not finding out who runs the Cube. There are the explanations offered by the characters, or the viewer can invent her/his own. It is quite irrelevant to the main point of the movie anyway.It may not be so easy to judge the actors. Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin) and the autistic guy were convincing, the others either seemed too faceless or over-acting. But then again, Leaven could have just been as unimpressive in real life as Nicole de Boer portrayed her. Similarly, it's not easy to judge how far Holloway's paranoia can push her.Bottom line, with all the minor flaws, I rather liked Cube. It was disturbing and depressing, and a nice display of ordinary people in extreme, easily fatal situations.

As they move about the cubes, they discover that some are equipped with deadly, sadistic traps.The power of Cube lies in its seemingly simplistic storytelling these people don't know how they got there, why they are there, who put them there, or what the whole thing means, but with no food or water, they decide they better find a way out, and fast.  The setting provides a tense, clausterphobic nightmare, with the strange, darkly lit walls of the cubes covered in odd, almost alien figures and writing, as if they were some kind of extra-terrestrial hieroglyphics.  The simplicity of the entire production design makes it a wholly believable, stomach-churning realistic situation.  They're aided by a fantastic script that truly makes the most of the paranoid characters and overwhelming setting.The cast of relative uknowns does an excellent job of conveying the paranoia and fear apparent in being stuck in an experiment that is a both sickly logical and illogical.  While the script is busy unraveling the mystery of the maze they're in, it doesn't neglect to show us why these people should survive.  The characters, much like the maze itself, are multi-faceted and filled with traps of their own.  If seeing them attempt to survive the demonic cube maze isn't enough to invoke suspense, the film douses itself with characters who are as rigid and filled with hidden danger, giving the audience a double dose of terror.In a film that takes place entirely in the same surroundings, it's amazing how effective Cube is in building a mountain of suspense in what appears to be a very constricting area.  The film could have turned into monotony two hours of it shot in the same scene.  Director Natali uses this to his advantage, however, and delivers a truly terrifying, gripping, almost suffocating  film dripping with enough tension to fill more than a few vapid horror and sci-fi films.  With an effective cast, a script with brains and originality to spare, Cube is easily one of the most inventive and utterly frightening sci-fi films ever.9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Weird and wonderful movie","Date":"8 December 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  Cube is a masterpiece.  It's one of those movies where you can watch it over and over again and you'll never get bored of it.  It's the best sci-fi movie I've seen since Highlander.I won't bore you with a full explanation of the storyline. So here is a small brief description Cube tells the story of a group of 7 people, a cop called Quentin, a doctor called Holloway, a student called Leven, a typical office guy called Worth, an escape artist called Rennes, a mentally handi-capped person called Kazan and a person called Alderson, who we don't find much out about him.They all wake up in a giant Cube shaped maze. They don't know each other, they don't know why they have been put there and they don't know whose behind it all.  So basically, they set of to find a way out of the deadly maze, having to avoid deadly booby traps and other puzzles along the way as well as avoiding each other, you never know when insanity is going to creep up on you. The actors in Cube may not be well known but never the less, they do a brilliant job.

Cube is wonderfully refreshing for both sci-fi and cinema fans alike. Like 'The Blair Witch Project', much of the pleasure of 'Cube' derives from it's undeniable originality, meaning it can be appreciated whether or not you enjoy the film on a personal level.The simplisity of the film is hard to comprehend without actually viewing it. There is one set (Perhaps the films strongest character, seen as the 'villain'), a tiny cast of characters who each have a very specific role to play within the plot structure, and a wafer thin storyline (Six people wake up in a giant maze and attempt to escape, and that's it). There is no true explanation of the Cubes purpose, various theories are suggested by the prisoners, but each is fundamentally flawed. It simply exists to give us an hour and a half of nerve tingling drama, as we quickly realise that the details don't matter, it is simply a study of a group of people in peril and the friction and comradeship that develops therein.Despite the aforementioned budgetry constraints, the movie contains some amazing visuals, notably the spinning wire trap that the policeman nearly gets caught in, and of course, the jaw dropping opening, where we are introduced to the cube as an unnamed prisoner gets suddenly and spectacularly 'cubed'.Like the rooms of the cube itself, this is a sparsely decorated, sometimes frightening, but always ingeniously designed piece of science-fiction cinema. Unforgettable.

But for a small budget, this is a great effort.  For me, the writing of a movie is definitely the most important creative element.  What's the point of great acting if the story is weak?We never know what happened before and after this movie.  This is the way it should be.  If you want to see the big, evil Man throw these people into the Cube, go watch a Hollywood movie.  I see this movie as possibly a metaphor for life, as pretentious as that sounds.  You don't know what was once before and you don't know what's after.  As one character proclaimed, we don't know why or how it came about except that he was part of it.  They kept building and architecting it but it never seemed to have a purpose.  It was self-perpetuating to no true end at all.The acting was solid if not spectacular.

Six people find themselves in a maze of interlocking cubes with no explanation. They must work together to solve the clues that are left for them, avoid deadly traps, and find a way out.This film is not low budget. It is practically no budget. It was made for a tiny fraction of what most Hollywood blockbuster sci-fi films are, so to criticize the film quality, visual effects, etc. is really specious and indicative of a rather shallow perspective. In fact, and no one has mentioned this, most of the visual effects, props, and extra production were DONATED for this film. When was the last time you heard of that? Yes the traps are less than mind blowing at times, but that is not the point. They are a device for the plot, to focus on them is to miss the entire point of what the film is about.Yes, some of the performances are less than stellar. But nothing worse than what Costner typically turns in, and his salary is several times the entire budget of this film, so get over it. Most of these actors are in their early twenties (as is the most of the crew) and still learning their craft. Get past it. The filmmakers made a conscious decision to paint the characters as stereotypes initially, and then turn those stereotypes 180 degrees. They were not entirely successful in realizing this development, but they admit that themselves in the DVD commentary. Again, get past it.For those of you who are ticked off because none of your questions were answered, is this really what you want out of all the films you see? Every film should pose a puzzle, solve everything in a neat, tidy package so you can nod your head and walk out of the theatre without a second thought? Sorry, occasionally films are made for the purposes of making you ponder and consider the issues they raise, not just to provide you easily digested film fodder. Wake up your brain, it won't hurt so much. This movie is not about who made the cube (we all did) or why the people are in it (who knows?), it's about whether we can break from the shackles of endless human stupidity and apathy that have created the society we live in.Yes, the ending is a little trite. As I've said, the film does not succeed in all areas. You try realizing such an original concept on almost no budget, filming in confined spaces with an inexperience cast and crew and do the whole production in 20 days. If you can put the film in perspective, you'll be able to appreciate the intent if not the realization entirely.And, finally, the math does make some sense, although budget constraints caused them to use some number plates in the wrong places. In the commentary, the filmmakers are clear that their intent was to give the viewer the idea of the solution, but not to get bogged down in mathematical details. The overall solution makes sense (and was developed with a mathematics professor on hand), it just isn't completely laid out in the dialog. Again, if your sole basis of evaluation is on technical completeness, you are missing the point of the film.In sum, this is worth seeing. It is not a great film, but it is thought-provoking and a welcome respite from the let's send a bunch of Texans into space to blow a meteorite tripe that passes for science fiction film these days.And, if I've offended any of the intellectually challenged amongst you, well you probably don't know it anyway.dr. beat "}{"Title":"Unexpectedly Awesome ! 7/10","Date":"21 November 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  This film sets the conditions for great science fiction  raising more questions than it actually answers.

All these people, all so very different, situated in one small area with one common potentially lethal dilemma.  It's fantastic.  They never revealed how they got there or who put them there but that's part of what makes it good. About 30 minutes into the movie, it dawned on me that this is basically something like a Tales From the Darkside or a Twilight Zone that got made into a movie.  Both those shows were primarily made of great stories woven around a small number of characters and cheap sets.  This is what the movie basically was.  If you liked those shows, you'll enjoy this movie.The only drawback I saw were the acting.  Some of the primary characters, the cop for one, absolutely sucked.  It was nice how he tried to appear the nice leader at first and changed, but overall that guy is not a very good actor.  The autistic guy was horrible as well.  Must all autistic people be good at math or have good memory?  Well, in Hollywood they all do it seems. Worth's character was very well acted though.  I liked him a lot and hope to see more in the future.I'll admit though that one bad showing doesn't mean they'll always be bad.

And now, if you are fairly adverse to any sort of a SPOILER, I suggest you stop reading.The thing is, it's all about bureaucracy.  Quentin is the cop with a chip on his shoulder who gets drunk on his own sense of power.  Leaven is the student who feels guilty for the problems in the world that she's been handed.  Hollaway is the bleeding heart doctor who is more willing to believe conspiracy than the cold hard facts of life.  Kazan is the idiot savant who is the most innocent of the bunch, and whose fate is dependent upon them.  Last, but certainly not least, Worth is the young civil servant whose only inspiration in his career is his pay check.  All of these people are prototypes of members of society, and the clashes that result between them are not due so much to the Survivor/Lord of the Flies aspect, but outline the stereotypes and prejudices that each member holds for the others.  Each becomes a cog in the system...in that manner, it is far more frightening than Halloway's worst case of Big Brother is Watching, for she, too, is part of the force that propels the cube.Worth says that the whole project of building the cube would be a waste if it weren't used.  This is perhaps the most damning statement of the way the system works.To be frank, I wasn't paying particular attention to the acting or innaccuracies in math...the concept was simply too good.

Shades of the legendary Prisoner TV program, or No Exit by Sartre.  Typical existentialist themes why are we here, what can we do, how do we solve our problems, is there any reason to have hope?The themes are reasonable, but the execution is terrible.  What one expects is a thematic pursuit about what people want to live for, some psychological exploration, etc.  What we get is inconsistent character development and insulting plot twists.My main problem with this movie is that the Worth and Quentin characters are very inconsistently drawn.  In the first half of the movie, the Quentin character provides leadership qualities, getting people motivated and moving, keeping up hope, while the Worth character is moody and generally acts like a coward and an ass.  Suddenly, in the middle of the movie, each undergoes a magical transformation.  Worth is now the moral force behind the group, while Quentin becomes violent and rageful, ultimately reaching a state where he is a typical movie bad guy.  His psychosis appears suddenly without rhyme or reason.  Any hope I had for this movie went out the window when it appeared.  The movie was no longer even a half-decent treatment of existentialist themes, but rather had degenerated into watch out for the bad guy stuff.  Very disappointing.One minor quibble the Leaven character is somehow easily able to tell if a three-digit number is prime or not, but then is paralyzed if she has to decide whether a number is a prime power.  As a professional mathematician, I have to say this plot twist is laughable.  Factoring three-digit numbers is a simple trick for a mathematician of Leaven's supposed caliber. The number of prime powers less than 1000 which are not themselves prime is really quite small.  One doesn't need a Rainman-type savant to solve this problem.  (Had they been factoring the full 9-digit numbers, well, that would have been much more impressive.)

The relatively low budget (which does not hinder it one bit) and the use of  some complex maths should not put off fans of the genre from an intelligent, modern and thrilling sci-fi movie that will really make you think.

In both the movie and the play, several people with no obvious connection are thrown together for no obvious reason.  The movie performs best when it follows the Sartre plot closely but strikes some flat notes when it strays too far. For example, the early character interaction (while somewhat wooden) is very beleivable.  However, the hints that the Government created the Cube (naturally)add little to the plot while Sartre's room is a metaphor for a possible afterlife (a thought our movie characters never seriously consider).The tension between the characters was fairly well done although it escalated to the truly homocidal a little too quickly and too disjointedly for my taste.  And, while the movie had some well-timed and truly stomach twisting turns(PLOT SPOILER WARNING)-- like the cold-blooded murder of the doctor --the final blood bath and the weepily symbolic ascension of the idiot were a little to trite to be consistent with the movie's thoughtful tone.All in all, really worth seeing once.  If you have already seen it, I strongly recommend reading No Exit and then seeing it again.  You will enjoy the contrast.Feel free to let me know what you think.P.S.  I think the Lord of the Flies comparisons made by many fellow reviewers miss the mark a little.

The problem is that it soon becomes clear that all of the characters are deadly dull and formulaic, and that we're not actually gonna see many rolling heads. Worth a mention is the doctor (I forget her name) who, whether by design or appaling scripting, is one of the most annoying characters in any movie, ever.The way they circumvent the traps too (I won't give it away here) is totally random, it's like the writer had no idea how to do it, so went back to school textbooks to try and come up with something vaguely scientific. The problem is that when they're having arguments over it, it just sounds stupid and contrived.Personally, I'd have rather see a few more intricate traps rather than the moderately poor collection that we get to see, a few more deaths (although obviously that'd involve paying more actors).Worth a watch due to the strength of concept and pure sci-fi-ness of it all, but could have been so, so much better.

Take 5 different people from different backgrounds and place them into a void of uncertainty and the unknown. From scene to scene they have to interact and help each other in order to discover a way of escaping from the spiders web. To an extent aswell, the film delivers on this level. Tension is created between the character (if seemingly manufactured and false at times) is present, the five stereotypes realise their difference, their weaknesses and their strengths and continue on in their plight. As a background to this, the concept of the Cube, a squared prison that these people have been unknowingly placed in serves to as to the mysterium of the story. We 'are' drawn in and we 'are' intrigued. So where does the film falter? Characters.When I watched this film, I found that out of the five different characters, only one seemed remotely likeable and real. That character being Leaven, wonderfully acted by Nicola De Boeur. Aside from Leaven's innocent, yet intelligent mind, we are left with four wholly unlikeable people whose only purpose in life seems to be to hinder and to annoy. Quentin, the stereotypical black cop. Brutal, family man who beat his children but who snaps at the slightest twinge. Holloway, the paranoid, neurotic doctor who seems to spend every waking hour of her days dreaming up far fetched conspiracy theories. Worth, the designer of the exterior who feels that it isn't important to tell everyone that he knows what they are inside, when quizzed as to why not, I didn't ask is the lamest and most wholly selfish reply anybody could give. And finally, Kazan, the mentally handicapped, who despite the morals of the story, does act as a liability. His only use is to turn everyone against each other. When his purpose is finally revealed, even then he serves to turn person against person.This is a story about characters. The only trouble is, we need characters we can identify with, not characters who we deplore. It almost seems fitting that the only person to escape from the Cube is the one person who has the least chance of making it on the outside.Great idea. Bad characters.

The most offensive onslaught over acting comes from a man portraying an idiot savant type, and he basically pulls out of his bag of tricks every movement and nuance that you could learn on a school yard amidst several cruel eighth-graders in an afternoon. I hate to say it, but I cared so little for any of the characters, that I didn't really want any of them to get out of the cube.

With only one set to play with, the movie sustains the interest throughout.  Basically, it's high concept stuff.  Six manifestly incompatible characters are trapped inside a massive cube full of interconnected rooms, some of which contain deadly traps.  All the characters have to do to escape is avoid the traps, work out the structure of the cube and try to get on with each other.  Unfortunately, it's the latter that proves hardest, as the movie decides to illustrate Sartre's dictum that hell is other people.  The movie has several scenes of almost unbearable tension - I was wincing and hiding my face when the characters faced a room which they could only pass through if they remained silent.  There are also a couple of startling, gory scenes early on.  The film's twists are always well thought out, and the scenes containing the group slugging it out with their emotional problems are devastating.  The problem, however, is that some of the characters seem a little pat - they become stereotypes, and the acting is rarely good enough to hide the stilted characterization.  That said, if you like mathematical puzzles, or you just like a movie that has ideas and is prepared to follow them through, you should check this one out.  However, the film's bleak messages about human nature may prove a little hard to stomach. "},{"Title":"Whoa...

The entire film takes place inside an artificial environment, out of control and functioning with mathematical precision.  No other film in the 1990's - the decade which saw science fiction become respectable - gives us such a simple yet colourful snapshot of contemporary technocratic life and fears.  Budget-wise it's in the same league as _The Blair Witch Project_ (i.e. under $2 million), made on a shoestring, with donated special effects and a home grown cast, snagging a Sundance award, and grossing relatively scads of money.  There aren't any explosions in it, or bullets; the pathos works, it's respectful of blood, and it looks pretty.  It feels like a sci-fi version of those Canadian Heritage shorts in between tv commercials.  ...and first built in 1997, it's been running ever since.  The C.U.B.E. A part of our heritage.
