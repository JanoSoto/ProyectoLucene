But only for the previews themselves.  Unfortunately, this movie takes a very smug and pompous attitude toward its subject matter, largely due to the fact that Golden Turkey Award creator Michael and Harry Medved were advisors on the project.  Anyone who is a real fan of these movies enjoys them for the silly schlock that they are.  The Medveds revel in ridiculing and lampooning them with no appreciation for them at all.  Surprisingly, this is the sense one gets from hosts Dan Aykroyd and John Candy, two performers one would think would have a special place in their hearts for these classics.Only Cheech and Chong and Gilda Radner seem to get into the spirit of things.  While Candy and Aykroyd poke fun and insult the movies, Cheech, Chong and Radner play along with them, and create some genuine laughs.But the real stars are the clips themselves, which are great fun and great nostalgia.  Oddly, amid these bad movies are such recognized classics as THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, WAR OF THE WORLDS and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  Scenes from outrageously over-the-top cautionary films about sex and marijuana are utterly hilarious.Highlights are Chong ordering a truckload of candy at the concession stand and Radner doing her little girl schtick from Saturday night live.

The thing was I thought the best moments actually involved the crazy movie clips themselves, than that of it focusing on its mugging stars and the wraparound sequences. The problem was that I found most of the remarks (which at times were surprisingly sparse) not to be all that funny, well Cheech and Chong came across more so genuinely smooth in their humour within the cinema (especially Chong at the candy bar and sitting their watching the films) and it came across an inspired choice for them to rip on the eccentrically pitched cautionary drug movies. However some of those scenes with the other stars in between the collection of clips just didn't gel, as for one Aykroyd really did get on my nerves. Some skits were better implemented than roughly penned others, but the feature does feel like one big trailer (or movie preview) for bad schlock movies&#x85; some which are hard to believe you're actually seeing it on screen. Nothing is safe in the wryly tongue-in-cheek It Came from Hollywood.

Then consider the fact that the narrators of this are all veterans of the original company of Saturday Night Live with STV's John Candy thrown in for good measure. In order to understand the cult following of such deliciously bad science fiction movies as It Conquered the World and Plan Nine From Outer Space, you also need to be able to compare it to The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds. Great time and artistic effort was put into creating those masterpieces which stand the test of time, while the others stand the test of time because they are so delightfully silly you can't help but turn them into comedy classics that just happen to involve outer space creatures.Then, there's killer trees, wobbling rocks that manage to crush their victims even though they stroll around on turtle time while human beings can certainly outrun them (if they would only stop wasting their time trying to shoot them!), white furred apes, creatures from the sea that look like they are trying to break the Coney Island record for eating hot dogs and various other inhuman beings that can't remotely compare with the artistic talents which went into making The Creature From the Black Lagoon. Giant turkeys, leeches, lizards, insects and even vegetables pounced up on our drive-in movie theater screens, making the giant ants of Them! and tarantulas seem like classics, much like the original Dracula and Frankenstein were 25-30 years before most of these movies were made.The funny thing about these bad movies is the fact that once you get past the idiotic subplots, you really find yourself enjoying them. They are extremely clever in their own inept way, maybe unintentionally, but some filmmakers must have known that their subject matter and monsters were ripe for ridicule. Some of these films make Ed Wood's notoriously bad turkeys step up a notch. I guess you could say that there's an art to making bad movies. Some of the narration here truly is bad, but it will be the film clips that you'll want to experience here, not the dumb quips from the original not ready for prime time players.Two specialty segments cover teens gone wild and the bad musicals of the golden age of Hollywood. Certainly, the teens gone wild segment is truly funny, totally reminding me of the Lois Bromfield spoof, Sorority Girls From Hell, but it is the musical sequence narrated by Gilda Radner which struck my interest. Main-stream movies such as Sunny Side Up and Wonder Bar get included with two truly campy production numbers. The Sunny Side Up number, Turn on the heat!, shows dancing girls making bananas grow on the vine just by wiggling their chests at them, while Goin' to Heaven on a Mule strikes controversy today with its depiction of blacks in a small section of heaven (the white section is three times as large) eating pork chops right off the tree, plucking chickens and frying them, and most tastelessly, a giant watermelon which opens and has a tap-dancing Hal LeRoy in black face popping out. Other musical segments aren't really from musicals; One of them is actually from an MGM Technicolor short from the mid 1930's, and the rest are silly brief song interludes from some of the worst Z grade adventures ever filmed. So the film is a mixed bag of clips, but there is something here for everybody to enjoy and it might inspire future filmmakers to go out and research these films to try new ideas of their own.

I would not say that this film is outstanding but it was humorous to see the sets and costumes worn in the golden era of 'B' type films with the narrative performed by comedy actors from the early 80's.I really do not understand how people can say that it was a 'Gem' since the entire film consist mainly of footage from non-classic films with added commentary by the hosts. It was a nice look back at early low-budget films but not much else in the form of entertainment.The best thing is that nearly all the cheap, low-budget, corny 'B' type movie scenes are now in one place.

"},{"Title":"It Came from Hollywood (and other places)","Date":"22 February 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Documentary, Comedy","Review":" This isn't as much a movie as it is a loose assembly of B- to Z-grade movies that have been produced between the 1940's and late 1970's (and not only did they come from Hollywood but Japan as well), narrated by numerous Saturday Night Life-comedians. We're talking movies like Mars Needs Women, Reefer Madness (who but Cheech and Chong would be more likely to make fun of that one?), The Incredible Strange Creatures who stopped living and became mixed up Zombies; indeed, we're talking the works of Edward D. Wood Jrn.It's nice to see some of your favorite 80's comedians, some which have passed on since (John Candy, Gilda Radner), others which have fallen into obscurity (Dan Akroyd, Cheech and mainly Chong). Granted the gags and jokes are all rather silly, definitely not especially gifted (and considering that this is from 1982 and that we are used to a little sharper, even cynical humor these days, they haven't aged very well), but then again, we're dealing with bottom-of-the-barrel films, hence let's just call them appropriate.It's also interesting to reflect, 30 years down the road, how many truly awful movies have been produced since then and the path that the industry in general has taken. Movies like Battlefield Earth or M. Night Shyamalans The Last Airbender (well, actually every Shyamalan picture since The Sixth Sense) would certainly not be out of place if they ever remade It Came from Hollywood. However, there is one exception while It Came from Hollywood focuses on films that were generally generated by a shoe-string budget, the more recent cinematic train-wrecks have swallowed millions upon millions of dollars.Seven from ten points out of sheer curiosity value &#x96; wait; make those six points for having included The Incredible Shrinking Man and War of the Worlds.

The movie's so dumb that it even includes sequences from good films such as The Incredible Shrinking Man, which is rightfully regarded as a 1950s sci-fi classic.The celebrity narrators aren't even that funny, while they remind us over and over (and over) that some movies are just plain awful. The film finally rambles to an awkward ending--including John Candy laughing while his jowls and stomach shake--leaving the audience with a message of...what happened?

They were also made aware of many movies that they were unaware of previously. I think this movie was a major factor in the resurgence of Ed Wood, and also the fact that virtually all the other movies shown on ICFH are now available on DVD.I think the first six years of the MST3K series,is basically a continuation the Cheech&Chong skit on ICFH.

In 1982, unlike today, not many old horror/science fiction films were out on video and these films were getting harder to see on TV. So watching this was the closest for me to seeing many of these films again and parts of ones I missed. I really didn't pay much attention to the wrap around sequences provided by Gilda Radner and others, except for the parts with Cheech and Chong, whom I have always found stupid and annoying. I found their presence here repugnant then, and I still do.  At the time I overlooked the films repulsively arrogant, condescending attitude it adopts towards these old films.Now however, viewing this film, there is no longer a reason (for me at least) for this films existence because1)Almost all of the films excerpted in this film are obtainable on video, some even on DVD for you high tech yuppies, if you know right places to look.2)The so called funny wrap around sequences featuring many comedians were not considered very good when this film first came out, and they look even worse today. These sequences have accomplished what seems to be the impossible - making clips from notoriously boring turkeys like ROCKET ATTACK USA somehow seem more interesting then they really are. But that is no credit to the comedians or the films makers. Its that these wrap around sequences are so dull, that the films they attempt to lampoon seem exciting in comparison. 3)The films overall smarmy, cynically condescending attitude towards these films becomes annoying. Granted, a good percentage of these films are turkeys like ROBOT MONSTER and PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE. Some are only mediocre, but a few are generally and rightfully so, regarded as classic films like WAR OF THE WORLDS and THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN. Others like are ATTACK OF THE MUSHROOM PEOPLE, while rebuffed by mainstream movie watchers, is generally highly regarded by knowledgeable fans of horror and science fiction movies. Apparently, the writers of this sorry excuse for a film were suffering from the limited, narrow minded view that if its science fiction or horror, its automatically worthless.4) This film features Cheech and Chong, a comedy team whose own career has been made on appealing to the lowest common denominator in public taste. Throughout their long and dubious one joke career, they have managed to make even the worst Jerry Lewis films seem brilliant. Its a tad bit hypocritical for two stars of some of the worst movies ever made to make fun of other peoples movies. The bad films excerpted here look like Oscar winners when compared to films like UP IN SMOKE. 5) The only wrap around sequence I found appealing was the clips of various female monsters while the fifties classic Whats Your Name? played on the sound track.Thank you and have a nice day.
