Benji doesn't have the earmarks of an ambitious movie, nor did its initial publicity suggest it was going to be anything more than a matinée flash-in-the-pan, but positive word-of-mouth amongst kids was incredibly high, and Benji became the fifth highest grossing film of 1974 (no small feat; it's just behind The Godfather Part II). Although the slim plot pilfers heavily from Disney's That Darn Cat!, the canine star Higgins (from TV's Petticoat Junction) is an amazing find his expressions and reactions are priceless, and the film's narrative--Benji's escapades, his human friends, his romance with a little white pooch--proved to be immediate and bracing with the target audience. Charlie Rich's song I Feel Love (Oscar-nominated!) underlines the doggy romance with just enough sentiment to make the low-budget film a real crowd-pleaser. Followed in 1977 by For the Love of Benji, but with a different, look-alike dog and a hoked-up story, the sequel didn't crossover to older children. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"A movie for all ages.","Date":"28 December 2004","Score":"14 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Romance","Review":" I saw this movie for the first time when I was about six years old.

He has several friends whom he visits daily and as such has a routine with which he see's them. Bill, the man who owns the café, pays Benji with a dog bone everyday he comes by because when he comes by that let's Bill know that it's time to get the café ready for the lunch rush. The kids want to keep Benji (and his new found girlfriend, Tiffany) but their father won't hear of it. Then the kids get kidnapped and it's up to Benji to help save them.

I happen to love it. I consider it to be not only the best dog movie ever made, but also among my 10 most favourite movies of all time (yes, including Casablanca, The Thin Man, Gun Crazy, Chinatown, etc.). What makes this movie so wonderful is Higgins, the dog (under the direction of his trainer, Frank Inn). Higgins was so far beyond other dog actors that it is impossible to explain to folks who don't own dogs or train dogs. Not only is he cute and photogenic, expressive and believable, he did all his own stunts -- and he was 14 years old when he made this film!!!Folks who review this movie tend to mention the kid actors, or the creaky kidnapping plot -- but, you know, that's not the point. If you wanted to look at it that way, you could also mention the wonderful interactions between Higgins and Edgar Buchanan, an actor he had worked with for many years on the TV series Petticoat Junction. Those scenes have a delightful sense of improvisation and charm that easily offset the whiny kid scenes. But the movie is not really about those kidnapped kids at all. It is about a small dog, his daily routines, and how, when those routines are broken, he must rise above his simple life and accomplish a great deed. In a way, the film that Benji most closely resembles is Buster Keaton's magnificent silent classic, The General. The slow, repetitious set-up of Keaton with his train and Higgins with his rounds about town, the focused realism, the slightly down-at-the-heels outsiderness of the hero, the hint of love about to blossom if only the hero can provide for his beloved, the insistently lengthy attention paid to the immediacy of ultra-mundane cause and effect -- these are the same in both films. The openings have a documentary quality to them -- until, without warning, all hell breaks loose and the plot comes crashing in. Keaton's train is stolen! Kidnappers come to Benji's home! Then, in both films, we see an under-dog, so to speak, rise to the challenge of events and, working with only the slenderest of means and very little advance planning, counter one villainous turn after another, all the while attempting to right the wrongs that have been committed. The manner in which the heroes devise solutions to the problems they face, both in The General and in Benji, flow logically from the daily routines we saw them perform in the documentary-like first halves of the films, so they seem believable. We gain confidence alongside the heroes, see the sense in what they are doing, cheer for them to triumph, watch them rise to the verge of success -- and then a huge blow falls, a colossal set-back occurs, and we feel despair -- they'll never make it now, too much time and too much ground have been lost! But again, they apply themselves to the task, and now we hope against hope that they will be able to pull it off in time ... except that most people watching The General experience jaw-dropping amazement at the stunts and most people watching Benji really have no idea how great Higgins' stunt-work really is, and spend the last third of the movie in tears because Benji is such a small dog, and he's so dang CUTE, and ... awwww. I've watched The General at least 10 times and never cried once. I've watched Benji 10 times and cried every time. I cried just know, merely writing about it. But Benji is not just a cute dog movie, any more than The General is just a Buster Keaton comedy. Like the best of Keaton's work, it is a heroic movie, and a love story, and a story of physical action and bravery. I just love this movie, that's all.

This sweet little film certainly deserves to be remembered for several reasons, not the least of which is Benji himself, one of the most talented animal actors ever to romp across the screen. Benji, a stray, delights in his freedom and loves to roam the town every day, chasing the cat of an elderly lady(Frances Bavier), visiting with an elderly shopkeeper(the actor that played Uncle Joe on GREEN ACRES), and visiting the home of two children who, with the help of their housekeeper(Patsy Garrett), feed him every day. Benji even finds love in Tiffany, a tiny white female terrier. Things take a serious turn when some dishonest crooks take the children hostage for a ransom and hid out in Benji's house! The sequence in which Benji frantically tries to get help for his friends is harrowing, especially when he bravely enters the children's house and is throw out by the housekeeper. But Benji saves the day.Unlike some recent so-called children's films that offer mixed messages or questionable content, BENJI tows the line. There's a positive vibe in this movie, one that is almost extinct in current movies. And another note several familiar faces from classic TV are here Aunt Bea from THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, Uncle Joe from PETTICOAT JUNCTION, and Zeke from GREEN ACRES as one of the kidnappers! Definitely worth adding to your home library, especially if you have kids.

Benji is a lovable character who hustles everyone in the neighborhood with charm and charisma. Two kids , children of a doctor, want to give him a home there with them, but the doctor has all kinds of phobias against canines and will not hear of it. Benji finds a girlfriend ( no kidding) and shares food and his secret hide-away--a deserted house--with his new acquaintance...until fate steps in and dictates the direction of the action. The kids are victims of a plot and Benji--and his girlfriend--come to the rescue using what measures they can muster. It's really cute, though it gets a little ugly when the bad guys appear...and there seems to be an un-explained flashback of sorts that Benji has regarding an incident with firearms. This, to my thinking, should have been developed a little better to convey to the audience that this was a motivating factor for Benji's actions...and why. But, one can suspend sensibilities if a dog is intelligent enough to convince you that he knows what is going on and has the best interest of people at heart , and that applies in this instance. Besides, since he was a homeless dog, there may have been myriad instances that were unpleasant remembrances...still it is nice when the writers and the directors let us in on what happening by way of full disclosure. But, it's a nice flick, the kids will love it, and adults will too. It's early seventies so that pacing of the film is not quite as frantic as it would become some seven or eight years down the road.

The early seventies was the era for Benji, whose real name was Higgins, an attractive and photogenic dog that had already had a recurring role in Petticoat Junction, the successful sitcom of the sixties. Edgar Buchanan, one of the stars from that show is on hand to act with an old pal again.Joe Camp, the director and screen writer, targeted this film toward a young audience of children under ten. Higgins and his trainer, Frank Inn, do wonders for the film. Benji shows a dog that has a natural intelligence and responds well to whatever it was asked to do. The film will delight young children.Some other faces in the movie are Frances Bavier, Deborah Walley, Patsy Garrett and others. Although the movie is predictable, let's not forget it was targeted for a young audience that will probably appreciate it more than the grown ups. "}{"Title":"If Dogs Made Films","Date":"9 July 2006","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Romance","Review":" Although I did initially see Benji as a kid in 1974, I want to talk about some interesting facets of the film for adults instead.Just a brief comment on showing the film to kids, though. It's probably going to be more of a gamble at this point in time for kids to watch Benji. There's a chance that older kids will be bored by the pacing, content, and general lack of humor. They'll probably hate the music, too. For younger kids (say, maybe 8 or younger), there's a better chance that they'll be entertained merely by seeing cute dogs do unusual things and also that they'll identify with the two child stars, who are about their age. But during the climax of the film, there is some more intense material (at least the ideas involved--the actual images are relatively tame) that may disturb some children.I think that Benji is probably a safer gamble for adults at this point in time, but you have to approach it in a particular way, not necessarily approaching it either nostalgically or as a kid's film. Viewing Benji at this point in time, it played as a dog's film, told from a dog's perspective. While this is not the only film to tell a story from an animal's perspective, producer/writer/director Joe Camp does something unusual in that he plays things mostly seriously and realistically. There is a bit of tongue in cheek-ness to the whole affair--and one section that is a very funny outright spoof of late 1960s/early 1970s romance films, and the events are idealized slightly in a way that we might imagine a dog to idealize them, but overall, Benji is played straight, not for laughs or melodrama.That fact is the cause of some unusual structural properties. Dogs' lives tend to be far more routine than humans' lives. Benji, as extraordinary as his life happens to be, is no exception. He's a stray who has a long daily routine that involves visiting various friendly people to obtain food. So the first half hour of the film sees Benji, from his perspective with a few third person omniscient intrusions, cycle through his daily routine two times.On the third run-through, things begin to get more dramatic as his routine is broken up slightly--both in a positive way when he finds a girlfriend by the way of a Maltese and in a negative way when some shady characters intrude into his otherwise abandoned home. Although I agree that an interesting, entertaining film could have been made out of just showing Benji go through his routine, that would have been relatively avant-garde, and Camp maybe decided that his dog-perspective film was unusual enough already, so the principal story turns out to be these intrusions which set up more classical dramatic conflicts.And Camp did a fine job of designing the film in the way he did. The climax works as well as it does only because he has taken us through Benji's lengthy daily routine a couple times. The climax and the build-up to the climax hinge on Benji hurriedly traveling his circuitous daily route a couple more times, and what pushes the events over the edge to success is that Benji has to strain to think more like a human.I wouldn't have picked up on any of these things seeing the film as a preteen in 1974. But they are there, and for adults, this is an entertaining film as much for its unusualness as for any other reason--you just have to watch it with this in mind. This is what films might be like if dogs made them. And if you decide to show Benji to your children and explain these unusual qualities to them, you might just find it a more enjoyable experience for both of you.

And it is to some extent that we would heartily concur. It never hurt to have all of these big guns firing full blast when a picture is going into general release. The thought prevailing thought here is that you gotta let'em know yer picher's out dere! Personal appearances or special guest starring promotional tours are an extension of all this. Thus, the Producer, Director, Star or other Actors involved are sent out on a tour; making the rounds of the old usual circuit of Plugola. They get booked, along with a Clip from their film to be on Letterman, Leno, Jimmy Kimmel, Today Show, Good Morning America, Regis, The View, etc., etc..But investing all the above and then some, will not guarantee even a modest success. A good case in point is the Triple Strength and Elongated spot granted on ABC Television's GOOD MORNING America to plug the current Left Wing Propaganda film, LIONS FOR LAMBS.GMA Hostess, Diane Sawyer devoted an at least a double segment to its promotion. The piece featured Stars Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep and Star/Producer/Director Robert Redford. The usual questions and mandatory clips were strongly in evidence; but Miss Sawyer added in a heavy dose of syrupy small talk and giggles to season the whole thing. And even with this extended mutual admiration society and personally oriented Gigglefest' , with plenty of voice-over laughter and schmoozy banter by Hostess Sawyer, this the greatest film since CITIZEN KANE, is bombing big time at the one place where all the B.S. in the World cannot help, at the Box-Office!* In direct contrast, we have some rather small, sort of non-descript films can barely get released; but somehow do. Then, because they do have something to offer the Public, they take off like a snowball rolling down a steep slope, getting more and more speed and power as it goes. All of this because of having a story that has something for Mr. & Mrs. John Q. Citizen. As for examples over the years we have examples such as AIRPLANE!(1980), MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING (2002) and even American GRAFFITI (1973).So this brings us to Today's Lucky subject, namely Independent Writer/Producer/Director Joe Camp's BENJI (1974). Mr. Camp took a good, veteran cast of players and building around it with some largely unknown players, like Cynthia Smith and Allen Fiuzat, the Kids in the story. The adults in the film are mostly well known to the public from their previously done work, mostly in front of TV Cameras. The cast included Peter Breck, Frances Bavier, Patsy Garrett and Edgan Buchanan.There was one more veteran player and he was Higgins the mongrel pup who had been featured on PETTICOAT JUNCTION (1963-70). He was one happily retired pooch when Owner/Trainer/Wrangler, Mr. Frank Inn brought him in for an audition. So here he was! Higgins was a bigger Star than ever before.Director Camp went through painstaking steps to tell so much of the story from the Dog's Eye View. The methods applied were akin to that applied in the Days of Silent Pictures. The Story was very visual and would have suffered with too-much of a script, especially if poor little Benji had too many lines to memorize and deliver.It has been said that &#133;&#133;Children and Dogs bring People together. and a Movie like this sure stands as testimony to the veracity of this old proverb.When you watch it, have your Kids or Grand Kids with you. And try to see it as if though their eyes.

Oh, its also completely adorable. Don't be fooled by the other language beginning, this is a great movie for kids and most adults. I mean don't get me wrong it isn't a The Godfather or House M.D. but it is highly enjoyable. Some other highly enjoyable family movies Black Beauty, Meet the Robinsons, The Incredibles, Snow Dogs, The Princess Diaries 1 & 2, Free Willy, maybe even the Kim Possible movies. So I would not recommend this movie if you are watching it with grownups, but I would if it is with your child, family, etc. "},{"Title":"Best movie ever made","Date":"15 April 2004","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Romance","Review":"  I really don't know what it is about this fantastic movie that I love  so much but I really do love it. It's so sad yet so happy, I love the way Benji (Higgins) looks, his theme song in the movie, his name, everything! One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Benji falls in love with Tiffany and the part when he ran in slow motion to save Paul and Cindy, that scene I almost bawled my eyes out. I first seen it on T.V. and I started watching it like in the middle of it. Then one day I rented it, and boy I'm glad I did. Then I got the story line better then I just cried and cried and cried! I have my stepsister to thanks because she told me it was on T.V. and I just love dogs. Oh I know what your thinking and yes I am obsessed with this loveable dog. I am so glad that this movie was made because it is my favorite movie ever, and always will be                          In loving memory of Higgins.                                God bless you.

I have no idea why this movie is so loved by critics and audiences, or why it was a HUGE box office success. The story is very padded - make that VERY VERY padded! And you see some footage actually used more than once! Still, it has a few charming scenes, and it's nice to see that Benji is portrayed as a very smart dog - not as a human in a dog costume. Also, it was great to see that the movie avoided the kiddie film cliche of portraying bad guys as bumbling nincompoops.

On the other hand I have always hated this particular dog, a feature on the last couple seasons of Petticoat Junction. Never a great show, the dog-less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time.Benji is an 86-minute mega-dose of the dog, following him on several daily circuits through the town of McKinney, Texas. If this sounds boring you would be advised to give Benji a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a Benji fan (if there are still any out there). Unlike My Dog Skip, Monkey Business or Because of Winn-Dixie the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. Big Valley's Peter Breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this lame. If one of your children (of any age) appears to be finding Benji entertaining you should consider cutting back on their medication.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

In his busy day Benji grabs breakfast at the house of two young children, has a chat with an officer of the law, chases an old lady's cat and reminds an aging café owner to start on the day's special. Helper to some, amusement to others, he is companion to all.Trouble arises when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion that he calls home. From here on we know only Benji can save the day.Plot is routine from writer/producer/director Joe Camp, and he does tend to over do the slow motion effects. Audiences though will find it hard to resist the lovable little pooch, and kids of all ages are sure to adore him. Cast were never going to be anything but background to Benji.Not what you'd call inspired, but fun family fare.

Higgins the Dog (hereafter referred to as Benji), a shelter rescue who had made a few appearances on the Paul Henning sitcoms Green Acres and particularly Petticoat Junction, stars here as a lovable stray who spends every day of his life traipsing from location to location. Each morning begins at Breck's house (unbeknownst to Breck!) where he gets his breakfast from the friendly housekeeper Garrett and receives affection from Breck's two children Fiuzat and Smith. Then it's off to the park for a visit with policeman Carter (and a little snack.) Following a daily scuffle with Bavier's white cat, he stops by the local café for a bone from friendly proprietor Buchanan (who Benji worked with on Petticoat Junction.) Each day ends with a trip back to his home, an abandoned, antique-filled estate where he keeps a makeshift bed behind an old chest. Life is great. He even meets a girlfriend in the fluffy and white Tiffany! One day, however, Benji is thrown for a loop when a quartet of troublemakers comes into his house and decides to use it as a base of operations for their upcoming criminal scheme. It's up to Benji to put these folks out of business which is no easy feat when he can't talk and no one seems interested in following him. To say that the leading canine is charming and adorable is an understatement. Somehow, his trainer has managed to capture an array of remarkable expressions and movements from him and he is perfectly captivating. Today, films featuring animals usually take the easy way out and use computer animation to achieve various looks and stunts. Not here. This is a real dog making real moments happen. It's no wonder Benji was a sensation after this. Despite the use of minor TV actors in virtually every other role, very few of the humans in the film make any sort of impact. Garrett probably has the largest role and she's not bad. Like most of the rest of the cast, she's hampered by some very obvious looping in post-production, perhaps due to extraneous noise while shooting on location. The children are very awkwardly amateurish, particularly Fiuzat. Breck has little to do and does it without a lot of conviction. Buchanan is rather charming in his lackadaisical way, Carter is likable enough and Bavier does an excellent job with her minor role. Granted, the script is hardly top-notch, but as the three (young?) men of the bad guys, Lester, Connelly and Slade are embarrassingly bad. The direction does them no favors either. Special scorn, however, must go to the truly hideous bit of acting turned in by Walley as the gang's lone female. She is atrocious; never more so than when she tries to avoid being uncovered by Benji near the films end. During the bulk of the film, there is a leisurely pace that may not sit well with viewers used to more frenetic editing and action. However, no one can deny the innate charm of the little four-legged star (and, to a lesser extent, his furry leading lady!) Dog-lovers will take him to heart, no matter the less-than-stellar production values.

He is friends with two children (Cindy and Paul played astonishingly bad) but their father won't let them have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany--ANOTHER adorable dog. They (instantly) fall in love and it leads to a hysterical montage of the two of them frolicking in the grass, drinking from a fountain...in slow motion no less! Also Benji lives in the cleanest abandoned house I've ever seen. Then the two kids are kidnapped by the most inept, unfunniest kidnappers I've ever seen and--wouldn't you know it--they hide the brats in the exact house Benji lives in! WOW was this bad! A huge hit (for some reason) in 1974 which led to many sequels (which I will NOT see). The film is just terribly acted with humor so unfunny and badly done that you just stare at the TV in amazement. The film also has a song that is played NONSTOP during the movie--so much that you want to scream. It was inexplicably nominated for Best Song at the Oscars--it didn't win. Yeah--the dogs are adorable and much better than the human actors--but I need more than cute dogs to keep me interested.You might think I'm being a little hard on a kids film but I saw it with my 5 year old nephew. Within 20 minutes he was bored silly and basically stopped watching. I kept watching in hope that it would get better--it didn't. Really lousy--but VERY patient kids or dog lovers might like it.Note to parents It's G rated but a dog is viciously kicked a few times. You don't see it--you just hear it and the dog survives but this might bother real young kids.

A stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two motherless children, much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold-hearted father. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the evil widower forbids his children --- who may or may not be mentally challenged --- from playing with Benji. Neither the children nor Benji obeys. Soon the children are kidnapped and Benji has to help the police find them. It's only then that the old man realizes that Benji is good, not bad.Tom Lester, whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim-witted Eb on GREEN ACRES plays one of the kidnappers. So does the regrettably over-utilized Deborah Walley. Walley's previous screen triumphs include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the woeful IT'S A BIKINI WORLD. She also played both Gidget and Tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her good-girl reputation by playing it bad! STAY away from BENJI...he's a dog and this movie is a dog!

The first hour is some of the highest quality family entertainment imaginable. The opening scene is made to look the opening of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. It's a hilarious parody as we see this little dog being liberated into a human world. We follow Benji through his daily routine and it's delightful, often hilarious. Sure, some of the human actors are a tad nauseating, but the canines take control and that's all that matters. Benji and his girlfriend Tiffnay have a very sweet relationship, very reminiscent of Lady and the Tramp. But when that first hour is over, so is the fun. Suddenly, a new movie starts--a ridiculous heist film. The French Connection on four legs? I don't think so.

The acting in this film is so bad, so amateurish, by dog got embarrassed watching this. He (Rusty, our Golden Retreiver) could have done a better job than the people in here.By now this is almost a trite story kid finds animal, pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the pet winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family. Sound familiar? I remember this movie being a big hit, but never got around to seeing it until the mid '90s on VHS. I was shocked how bad it was. Why so much fuss over a film? Was it because there was so much sleaze in the early '70s that a nice family film stood out in the crowd? Possibly. There wasn't a whole lot of wholesome entertainment in the decade of the '70s plus a lot of people are suckers for cute little animal stories. Who could resist this cute little dog? Not me. But the movie I can resist it's a Grade B storyline with horrible acting. Recommended only for small-dog animal lovers and I mean lovers because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this film in this day-and-age. "}]
