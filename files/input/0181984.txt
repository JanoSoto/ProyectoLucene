I know the basics and that could get me by until I asked people that were much more well versed and graceful when it comes to that side of business.  I do know however that the stock market can be sleazy and deceitful at times and it can also be cut-throat economics.  With this in mind I went into this picture with high hopes of at least a film that would teach me something about a part of life that I knew very little about.  I was also intrigued because Ben Affleck looked like he had the Alec Baldwin role from Glen Gary Glen Ross, that small but explosive role where the seasoned vet comes in and tells eveyone how to sell, when to sell and what the best way to screw people out of their money is..... and hey, what do you know, I was right.  Ben Affleck does have a similar role to Baldwin's.   But what I wasn't expecting was the film that was before me.  Boiler Room is one hell of a film and even if you know very little about stocks and bonds and insider trading and what-not, there is still plenty in here to keep you intrigued.The actors in here, while not huge by name alone, are quite good and keep your attention.  As I said earlier, Ben Affleck intrigued me the most, perhaps it isn't so much him but the character he plays.  He was the cocky-know-it-all-millionaire-playboy that cares about nothing but closing the deal.  He is greedy, self centered and most of all damn good at what he does.  He teaches the new recruits how to become ruthless and mechanically shut off emotionally.  In his world of stocks, there is no place for feelings of guilt, sorrow or pity.  In his world all you have time for is greed and anxiety.... anxious to cash you next $100 000 paycheck.  Ben Affleck has a small role in the film but it is an effective one. Giovanni Ribisi plays the good guy here, Scott Caan plays a young and wealthy broker that uses his wealth and power as a way to let go of his anger by constantly getting into physical altercations.  But in an impressive smaller role, the one who impressed me the most was Vin ( Caparzo from Saving Private Ryan and also the lead in Pitch Black )Diesel.  He plays his character ( Chris ) right down the middle.  He wants Seth ( Ribisi ) to succeed but he doesn't seem as ruthless as some of the other brokers and at the end he does something incredibly noble in the face of imminent doom, and that is what I found compelling about his character.  Most of the other characters are all driven by success and money and show little compassion, but Chris ( Diesel ) does have that side to him and I enjoyed Diesel's performance quite a bit in Boiler Room.The story is also quite intriguing and it is both fun and a little horrific to get into the heads and lives of these men as they deliberately try to ruin people's lives in the hopes of bettering their own.  They fraudulently sell normal people bogus stocks to bogus companies and it doesn't matter that the people they are selling to are family, blue collar workers that want so badly to believe the American Dream has just landed in their lap that they believe anything that these total strangers are saying to them over the phone.  And that gives the movie it's edge.Boiler Room is the best movie I have seen so far in this new year.  Although the new year is not even 4 months old yet, this is one film that may have a chance to make my top ten list of films for the year 2000.  This is the first film for writer/director Ben Younger and at the age of 27 it looks as though this guy has a good future in the game.  Not that I am comparing Younger to Spielberg or Boiler Room to Jaws, but Steven was 26 when he made Jaws and look where he is today.  Again, I am not saying that Younger is following in those footsteps but it is a great film for a guy that is three years less than 30.  I highly recommend this film to everyone!8.5 out of 10.... a great triumph for Ben Younger and all involved.

I'll start with the films flaws. Firstly, the main character is very weak, I'm not sure whether it's poor writing or bad acting but he just comes across as an idiot rather than the deep, flawed, entrepreneur that the film wanted to portray. Secondly, even in the year 2,000 floppy disks were an ageing technology, without giving much away there's a scene where an entire companies data is copied to a floppy disk. The film includes a lot of central characters and doesn't provide any back-story for any of them, this wouldn't be so much of a problem if the central character wasn't so weak but by the end of it you feel as though you haven't seen a single character develop or even begin to understood any of the characters but you have just seen a good film.Praise This film is amazing. The film really captures the desires of society and gives them a face. The characters really convey the shallow two facedness you come across every day where they're happy and pleasant until something happens that could even remotely damage their cash flow. Every person you've ever met that wanted to make a quick buck is in this film, the consumerism and lack of social conscience that constantly plagues society is so prevalent in this film. It also approaches the topic of share trading from a much more accessible angle, they don't put much effort into adding the right industry terms or showing scenes of the NY stock exchange - they show the consequences of share trading, the lack of understanding of the average consumer and give you a better understanding of where the money comes from. If you're anything like me then this film takes you on a ride where you are the main character every step of the way until finally you return to life with a much deeper understanding of the desires people succumb to in modern society. This film includes very young appearances by a lot of famous actors, Ben Affleck, Vin Diesel etc. who all pull their weight to give life to the film. I'm explaining the film in a very stale way but I can't help it, it's on par with 'fight club' - you can't explain why the film is good in a way that does it justice, just watch 2 hours of cinema that will improve your quality of life.

They crafted a convincing range of emotions, from cunning cut-throat manipulators of their clients' personal wealth during office hours, to brief examples of their boys will be boys shenanigans after hours. The story line is built completely around their personal financial greed, the hapless victims they scammed to realize it (with the greatest focus on one of them), and a well-sustained sense of mystery that plants seeds of possibilities along the way. The ending was not at all predictable; it could have gone in any of several directions. The viewer gets the impression that if these predators could yank even the last remaining penny out of a client on his (they targeted males) deathbed, they'd gleefully do so and view it as a major coup giving them full bragging rights. There's a hint of information about how legitimate stockbrokers earn their credentials and that was enlightening. The romantic angles are minimalized and that serves to benefit the film. The language is consistently coarse, but certainly seemed realistic for the characters' ages, their business sector and their work ethic. For everyone who enjoyed Glengarry Glen Ross, Wall Street (both of which are alluded to in the film), or even more appropriately The Crooked E The Unshredded Truth About Enron, this feature will really score a bulls-eye.

He starts an illegal gambling casino in his home, but is soon offered a job as a stock broker. This is a fast-paced occupation full of young guys who don't know what to do with their money. They gamble constantly, they party constantly; drugs, women and cars. On the surface, this is easily brushed off as a formulaic, pop-culture movie. If you pay attention though, this is a lot more than that. The subtext for this story is the relationship Ribisi has with his father. This relationship holds a lot of tension, and through the film goes through many changes both positive and negative, and culminates in a tear-jerking revelation. I'll admit it, I almost cried. But there is also a lot more going on here, most notably the story of one of Ribisi's clients who had domestic problems he had to face with his wife and children. His performance was impressive, and you really felt for him.

The regulations put in during the New Deal curbed them somewhat, but the deregulation that occurred during the Reagan Years put operations like these back in business. That and telemarketing did the rest.Our protagonist in this film is Giovanni Ribisi who's a kid that I can somewhat identify with, one who can't seem to please his rather stern father, Ron Rifkin, who also happens to be a federal judge. He'd like for Ribisi to get into traditional professions like law or medicine, but Ribisi is a child of his era and is on the lookout for a quick buck. That he gets from his current endeavor which is running a small casino out of his apartment. Though illegal Ribisi runs it honestly, but that fact makes no never mind to Rifkin.One of his steady patrons, Nicky Katt, interests him in going to work at his brokerage house which is not located in the heart of Wall Street, but out on Long Island. Gordon Gekko would be proud of this bunch, trained by Ben Affleck who lives the Gekko creed from Wall Street of 'greed is good'. But this crowd could never get in Michael Douglas's front door, remember what a hard time Charlie Sheen had in Wall Street. You've got your list of prospects, aka suckers, and you get on the phone and sell, Sell, SELL, but only what you want sold in a given period. The activity drives up the price and then it deflates, but not before the broker gives out. On Wall Street, it's called 'kiting' a stock.Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko takes us to the rarefied world of big time Wall Street corruption. These guys are the minor leagues of the same sport. Ribisi as he soon finds out was living more honorably as a casino entrepreneur. But he can't get out mainly because dad seems to have somewhat changed his attitude. And Rifkin's respect is all he wants.Boiler Room works best during the scenes with Rifkin and Ribisi, their up and down relationship is the key to the whole film. Other performances to watch out for are Nia Long as the secretary clearing $80,000.00 a year because of her insider information, Vin Diesel as a cheery hedonistic sort of bucketeer, and Nicky Katt is a more intense variety of the same breed.The one to really watch out for is Ben Affleck. It's a small part, but Affleck does wonders with it. Now this is a man who could really have made it Gekko's world and wouldn't have had the trouble that Charlie Sheen had crashing it or the conscience pangs after he discovers what it's all about. Affleck should have gotten Oscar consideration in the Supporting Actor category.In fact the whole film is sadly overlooked, don't miss it if it is ever broadcast.

It's a niche movie for 18-30 year old men who are frustrated with the grind, and would prefer an easier, quicker way to riches. Boiler Room also has some of the pent up male aggression that was astutely highlighted in Fight Club. As Seth Davis, Giovanni Ribisi plays the lead in this film. While his performance is solid and adequate in handling the most screen time, he is not the star of the show. Ben Affleck (as Jim Young), Nicky Katt (as Greg Weinstein), and Vin Diesel (as Chris Varick) provide the standout efforts of this ensemble cast.Affleck, in an ode to Alec Baldwin's character in Glengarry Glen Ross, is slick-talking, persuasive, and funny at the same time. Along with his work in Good Will Hunting, this is one of the best performances of his interesting on-screen career. The same can be said of Diesel who, for once, doesn't appear to be out of sync or awkward in the delivery of his lines. His performance is smooth and a very, very pleasant surprise.Katt is the sleeper of the trio (seen in smaller roles in The Brave One and Insomnia), and I like his attitude and confidence in the Weinstein role. He showcases the ability to handle a significant workload, and it's unfortunate that he hasn't garnered more screen time in subsequent movies. I doubt he was too happy going uncredited in The Dark Knight. Getting back to Boiler Room, youthful director Ben Younger does an outstanding job with pacing. This film blurs by without ever feeling too light or heavy, and Younger coaxes superb performances from his cast. The ensemble seems very comfortable working off each other, and Younger deserves credit for finding the right dynamic.Unfortunately for Younger, like Katt, he hasn't found subsequent success. That's disappointing to me, because the former flashes a great deal of promise with Boiler Room. It's one of my favorite lower-budget films of the decade, and it's a shame that it didn't make a little more money. When crap like Transformers II smashes in the box office, it makes you feel for quality movies that flop.It is what it is though, and Boiler Room gets a big thumbs up from me.

Instead of rhythms for the inner city, it's now a soundtrack for slick millionaires driving Ferraris. Ha.Anyhow, get past the fact that the voice over is annoying, and unneccesary. And while I have no grounds to judge any level of semitic looks, my girlfriend said that Giovanni Ribisi as a Jew is as convincing as Charlton Heston's horrifying Mexican Cop in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. No comment from me on that one.  An actor I have liked in the past, I'm afraid he is a miscast altogether in this one, unfortunately.Boiler Room references two movies Wall Street and Glengarry, Glen Ross. Instead of seeing Boiler Room, rent one of these instead.OK, you've read this far...so anyway The whole girlfriend in the middle thing.  So lame.  Why are writers hanging so much talent out to dry? There was nothing in this movie to convince me of any chemistry between Ribisi and, um, the actor who played the girl in the movie.  It just happened. Why do movie goers just accept that in order for a story to be told, there has to be a love interest involved?Also Is the moral of the movie So long as you do right by your dad, everything is OK?

The cast was fresh, i like all the performances here, any film that leaves me thinking Diesel and Affleck were not annoying and actually convincing has done miracles just in that on its own. Ribisi is great in the lead and Scott Caan was my favorite supporting performance although Ron Rifkin and Tom Everett Scott were great too.

Here, it's downright disastrous, for not only is 'Wall Street' plundered to no effect but Mamet's searing 'Glengarry Glenross' is also dragged in, book-ended by dialog that was fresh when Lemon and Mamet handled it but in this outing is tedious to the point of being vapid.The plot, such as it is, falls down more often than a drunk trader celebrating a Morgan Stanley bonus the leading character's father is a judge at great pains to protect his reputation, yet makes no effort to check out the provenance of his son's place of employment; the FBI is investigating his son, but no convincing explanation is ever given as to why it should be trying to gather the dirt on him when evidence in abundance exists where every other employee is concerned; the lead character's girlfriend is, or is not, an FBI informer, though it's impossible to care either way; the scam involves the creation of non-existent pharmaceutical companies which nevertheless inexplicably feature in the stocks reporting in the financial pages of major newspapers.With nothing whatever to hang on to other than a preposterously sentimentalised relationship with his screen father, Giovanni Ribisi struggles hard to make his character engaging, but fails, largely because there's no sense of loss for the audience to share in come the denouement &#150; Ribisi's character starts the movie with a Volvo station wagon and finishes the movie with a Volvo station wagon, none of the riches-beyond-imagination to which the movie frequently refers seemingly coming his way.At a running time of 115 minutes, 'Boiler Room' is 105 minutes longer than a sequence in 'The Sopranos' in which Christopher presides over a not dissimilar operation and his two psychotic henchmen beat up a trader who is actually trying to do an honest job of work.As 'The Sopranos' achieved more impact with that throw-away sequence than anything managed by 'Boiler Room', it's pretty clear that this is a movie that certainly doesn't warrant any kind of 'buy' recommendation.

It's definitely entertaining, but at times feels too much like a derivative of other financial thriller films, in particular Wall Street, with some references to Glengarry Glen Ross thrown in for good measure. Because of this, it feels kind of like an pale unoriginal imitation, more than something truly original.The story centers around Seth Davis (Ribisi), a 21-year-old college dropout living in Queens. In place of school, he runs an illegal casino out of his apartment for college students. He makes a good living, but does so against the wishes of his family, in particular his strict, cold father Judge Marty Davis (Rifkin). His father doesn't want to speak to Seth until he makes a living in an honest way. One night, towards closing time, he's visited by an old friend and his colleague. They tell him about being a stockbroker and recruit Seth to join a group interview. Wanting to impress his father, he goes to the interview at J.T. Marlin. About an hour away from NYC in the suburbs, Seth is immediately attracted to the sports cars and luxury suits worn by the brokers. He gets in good with the firm, befriending some of the top brokers and going from relatively weak on the phone into a lying, swindling sales hot shot. Eventually, he realizes J.T. Marlin is nothing more than a pump and dump chop shop peddling worthless penny stocks in a bucket scheme where the customer loses money on the stock while the firm keeps the profit and the broker a $2 commission per share purchased. He also has change of conscience when he scams an innocent man out of his life savings. Seth fights to get out of the situation before everything falls apart.The movie indeed is entertaining and the story interesting, but I just can't help but compare it to Wall Street. Seth Davis is no Bud Fox. Sheen played the role of Fox with the right about of naive innocence and slimy salesmanship. Ribisi keeps the same stoic expression, never seeming to change from the beginning of the movie to the end. The other thing is they both center around father-son relationships and how the sons want to impress their fathers. In Wall Street, you sensed the bond that the two had, which could have been helped by Martin Sheen playing the father role, but in Boiler Room, there seems to be no bond and by 21, if a son doesn't get along with his father, it seems like he'd have no interest in making that connection. Towards the end they have a great scene together, but the relationship seemed awkward for most of the movie. While Wall Street focused on a legitimate brokerage house in NYC which employed Ivy League graduates, Boiler Room is out in the cheaper suburbs, hiring likely blue collared kids with no degree. Maybe that's part of the movie's message, but it's hard to go from Wall Street to the suburbs if you watched Wall Street previously. The story just doesn't have the same punch or the same twists and turns of Wall Street. Ben Affleck does his best imitation of Blake from Glengarry Glen Ross, but it pales to the real thing and again just comes off derivative of Alec Baldwin. Also, there is a lot of unbelievability and things that don't make sense that happen too much in this film.It's entertaining for sure, but I'd stick with Wall Street and Glengarry Glen Ross if you want cautionary tales of high risk/high reward investment careers.

Ron Rifkin has a showy role as Ribisi's father.It's interesting that several compared this film to Wall Street and Glengarry Glen Ross - certainly the comparisons are valid - but someone mentioned a real-life comparison, to the Enron situation. The documentary I saw was Enron The Smartest Guys in the Room and I think that's an apt comparison as well.The plot concerns a young man, Seth Davis, who makes money running a backroom casino. His father is a federal judge and the two men are distanced from one another, his father making it clear that he doesn't approve.One night, a man comes into the casino and suggests a stockbroker job for Seth with a boutique company. Seth becomes a trainee there, and comes up against heavy competition and ruthless bosses and managers, one of whom is played by Ben Affleck and another played by Nicky Katt. He temporarily wins his father's approval as he learns how to always be closing with every phone call, and the art of the deal. There's just one problem - there's something a little odd about the place, and Seth can't put his finger on it. What he doesn't realize is that the business is under investigation, and the Feds have targeted someone close to Seth for information.Interesting film and very well acted. What's scary is, this type of thing worked with Enron so I wouldn't say it's unrealistic. Greed is greed, be it in stockbrokers, corporations, or stock owners.I felt like others, let down by the ending. I could have used another five minutes to wrap it up better.SPOILER HERE STOP IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE ***Did anyone else think Seth's father set him up? Not out of anger or cruelty, but to get him out of the situation and help to bring this place down. I found it hard to believe that as a Federal judge he would go along with this IPO and say, on the phone, that he wanted to help Seth so he wouldn't get caught - and this is all recorded and played back to him when Seth is brought in. The Feds banked on Seth spilling his guts in order to save his father. One would think his father would believe it would go the other way and therefore wouldn't have agreed to it, but he must have seen how desperate this kid was for his love and gone along with the Feds. They were threatening to strip him of his position as a judge. Seth's father a couple of scenes earlier wanted nothing to do with Seth because it jeopardized his job.

After telling them that I was also a stockbroker, they told me about some of their telephone tactics, all exactly like the ones used in the movie. They would do things like call people and tell them they had called before -- even if they never had. They also had the list of canned responses as referenced in the film, i.e. I need to talk to my wife about this. At your job you make business decisions everyday, think of this investment as a business decision. The name of their company even sounded like a legitimate firm -- just like the one in the movie. Obviously, the writers of this film spent some real time in the brokerage world to see just how these bucket shops operate.

The story often takes a back seat to intervals of exposition about the stock market and stock trading and completely unnecessary rat-a-tat dialogue between one young punk and another. Movies weren't always this way. Directors couldn't always get away with this much. Most still can't. Producers still have final cut most of the time and the `fat' is trimmed. Which leads me to believe that it's all part of the Big Studio Strategy. Get young butts in the seats by hiring young directors to make the movies.Not such a far out idea, especially when it bears such fine results as Boiler Room. What it's about, in short, is a youngster with a serious bad bone and just a tiny little bit of a conscience, Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi). Seth kicks law school because the illegal card game he's running out of his apartment is generating so much money, he's made it a 24-7 operation and there just isn't time for school.  We're expected to believe Seth actually thinks his father, a federal judge (Ron Rifkin), should be proud of him for his accomplishments.While I am by no means done ribbing this film, I will say that it is quite good. Any film that paints an evil portrait of those who sell things over the telephone is okay in my book, but there's more behind my approval than that. Seth's relationship with his father is explored thoughtfully and believably. Rifkin is great in this rare supporting role (he's usually stuck in character acting hell).  I liked how Younger dares you to care about this robot of a man, then slowly peels the layers away.Then of course, there's Ribisi as Seth, who really eats up the role of a fast-talking, built to sell young gun stockbroker. The character is so very interesting because he's too good at what he does for his own good. A person watching this film might begin to ponder what they would do were they in his situation. What if someone told you that you were `guaranteed to make a million dollars' inside of three months? The full version of this speech is delivered by the Alec Baldwin-ized Ben Affleck, who gets a lot of acting mileage out of his two scenes. He swears at the new recruits Seth is among; he bends them, breaks them, spits at them, mocks them, throws his car keys at them until they're ready to bleed for $150.00 a week.This brings me to my biggest hang up. It seems to me that half that conference room would be clear of people halfway through Affleck's tyrade. Here's the larger problem, though The way these guys talk to potential clients over the phone! If the guy on the other end of the phone talked that way to you, would you really trust him with ten thousand dollars of your money? I am no Shirley Temple, but when a strange person says the f-word twelve times inside of a three-minute conversation, TRUST IS BROKEN DOWN. I doubt I'm the only one who observed this.Boiler Room deserves the benefit of the doubt because it does what it sets out to do, which is, Get you thinking about the role of money in your life. You think about how there are just enough suckers out there to justify the existence of these persuasive, nearly abusive phone pitchmen. They can be anyone they want because you cannot see them.

You will not walk away from this film thinking that you just watched a 10, however, I found myself interested throughout. Ron Rifkin is excellent as Marty Davis, a judge and father who loves his son but really doesn't know how to communicate with him.

With promises of his first million within three years Seth gets into the high tension and fast paced world of the boiler room &#150; the salesroom floor where he begins as a trainee. He gradually grows within the organisation and starts seeing the beautiful receptionist Abbie &#150; despite the fact that she used to be with his new boss. However the deeper he goes, Seth begins to suspect that it can't all be as good as it looks and is unlikely to be as legal as he had been told it was.It might be the fact that the film actually name checks Glengary Glen Ross and Wall Street but at times this feels that, like its characters, that it has watched these films too many times and has simply added a touch of Goodfellas to it to produce Boiler Room. However this is actually a bit unfair because the film has just about enough of its own to stand out as rather an enjoyable and interesting look at the ethics of certain sections of the business world. It doesn't help it be engaging by having the 'none of this is true or even based on truth' disclaimer thing up front &#150; I understand why they did that but it undermines things from the get go and doesn't help it get off to a good start. Despite this the narrative is strong enough to keep things moving forward despite the weaknesses. Younger does well to recreate the testosterone-fuelled world where money is the only thing that matters and it tends to be this energy that drives the film where subplots on relationships struggle.The cast are a great help, featuring generally good performances despite the odd weak bit. Ribisi is the heart of the film and, although he doesn't totally convince in his narration he is a good lead, taking well to his character. Diesel usually strikes fear deep into my heart but here he is actually pretty good, as is Katt. Long is a good actress and great looking but this is not the best role she has had; she delivers it the best she can but the story uses her as a device at best. Caan is OK and Rifkin has a simple task to deliver. The only bum note was, surprise, surprise, Ben Affleck. His dialogue is OK but as the film struggles at times by coming over as a copy of better films, all I could think about with him was how great Alec Baldwin had been in pretty much the same role.Overall this works and has enough energy to drive it forward despite itself. The disclaimer makes it a hard sell early on, while the references (direct and unintentional) to other films don't help it be its own master but the good cast help and Younger gets it through regardless. There are better films but this has the energy to appeal to a younger audience that will likely enjoy it.

Yet I feel that this movie lacks strength due to it uses a weird selection for its cast, thus making the acting overall feels a little bit weird. Giovanni Ribisi, while experienced, doesn't really have the face and the character depth to do this role. Putting the more physical Vin Diesel as a successful stockbroker just doesn't cut it.

Seth is going nowhere with his life, getting by on running an illegal casino to the extreme disapproval of Judge Daddy Davis (Ron Rifkin). One night he gets an opportunity when a young, affluent stockbroker called Greg (Nicky Katt) offers the young entrepreneur a chance to join Greg's firm. There Seth learns the art of selling, cajoling. He learns about the pressures of a `boiler room' in an extremely macho environment where insults and abuse are regularly hurled at underachievers, by both their peers and betters. Everyone is out for money no matter what but, as time goes by, Seth begins to feel uncomfortable with the lack of scruples and the uneasy relationships that he forms.I have not seen either `Wall Street' or `Glengarry Glen Ross', which appear to be the barometers by which to measure this movie's merit (both of which are referenced within the movie in a homage). I did enjoy the movie though. There's a nice element of Seth trying to win his father's approval rather than the more tired approach of trying to detach himself from his father. The characters may not be pillars of morality but are shown not to be totally one-dimensional. Vin Diesel, for example, plays Chris Varick who becomes Seth's mentor when Seth's relationship with Greg begins to waver. Chris is most certainly no hero but there's a nice humanity to him in the manner in which he takes Seth under his wing. The characters are all enjoyable, including Rifkin who puts in a great performance as the hard-nosed but caring father. Even the moralising of Seth in the movie, which could easily grate, is only gradually developed and does not feel like virtues are being forced upon us. Unfortunately the way the plot ultimately develops is quite obvious, an inevitability that takes out some of the tension from the scenes. I've always enjoyed Ribisi's roles and its about time he got to take centre stage, which he does admirably. He's often been consigned to geek/nervous roles, but here he shows the ability to play a confident young man in control, with a driving will to prove himself. Diesel shows there's more to him than the muscle-bound action hero, portraying the hard-edged masculinity he's known  for with a little bit of a caring man underneath. Ben Affleck shocks us all by showing that he can actually act quite well given the right material - gone are his usual cardboard mannerisms and instead he actually controls any scene he's in with his loud, aggressive, antagonistic role - and it's a pleasure to behold.The direction, Ben Younger, is nothing outstanding. There's some nice use of more modern elements - music, fast cuts - to update the feel of a stock broking movie (plus, of course, a young and capable cast) and the boiler room itself does have a certain intensity. We certainly get a feel for the characters (even if we never love them). There's a lack of anything `great' about this movie but it's certainly enjoyable fare, and a grand entry in a small genre - you could do a lot worse with this cast and fortunately the end result, not out standing, serves its purpose. 6/10.

It is perfectly legal for a broker to pump and dump a stock and they do it all the time. I remember a news story about Fidelity doing that and there is a law languishing in congress to stop the practice (fat chance of that ever passing). There is a reason they call them brokers and not agents. They are not called agents because they do not represent you. They are called brokers because they are salesmen for the brokerage. The situation is like a store on Main Street only they sell stocks instead of other kinds of merchandise from an inventory that happens to be stocks. They have absolutely no legal obligation to sell you stock at the price they bought it. They only have to sell it at a fair market price.

The brokers call regular business and family men and invest their life savings into a company which will sooner or later fall.  The brokers walk away with the money, and a clear conscience. It isn't until one of the brokers, Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) who realizes that what he's doing is wrong, and begins to have second doubts with his career. BOILER ROOM has Seth working in a small brokage firm in New Jersey, away from the prime time business of Wall Street. In this firm he meets a colorful crew of co-workers.  There's Chris Varick (Vin Diesel) a man who is cocky, yet he's like a father figure to Seth.  There's Greg Weinstein (Nicky Katt) another broker who's jealous and harsh towards the rookie Seth. There's Abbie Halpert (Nia Long) a beautiful secretary who falls in love with Seth, but for a price.  There's Richie (Scott Caan) a short, yet strong muscle and strong minded man who won't put up with anybody's negative comments about his job. There is the firm's president, Michael Brantley (Tom Everett Scott) a man who appears to be very friendly and caring on the outside, yet is very cruel and cold on the inside.  And then there is the firm's recruit, Jim Young (Ben Affleck) a man who is vicious at first and is vicious from there on. BOILER ROOM is a captivating look at the lives and jobs that these young people go through.  It's a disturbing look to see these trick innocent business men into putting thier life savings into these companies that will go bankrupt sooner or later, including the firm's clients.  The movie does move in a steady and fast pace, and director Ben Younger does a very good job keeping the viewer's intrest.  The acting in this film is excellent!  Giovanni Ribisi does a great job as the main character, a man who tries so hard to please his father with a good job.  Nicky Katt is also great as the vicious Greg, a man who's only concern is himself.  But the films best performances come from Tom Everett Scott, Vin Diesel, and Ben Affleck. Scott makes a surprising and excellent first time villian. He does have that innocent and friendly face, like his previous films, but he can be a very cold and cruel villain.  Vin Diesel does a excellent job as well as the cocky Chris Varick, who does once in a while give a helping hand to Seth.  And Ben Affleck has never been more mean than in this film (and I mean meaner than DAZED & CONFUSED!)  He's very funny, and scary at the same time.  When he tells the new team players the rules and benefits that working at the firm will bring them, you're ready to work in the same office yourself! BOILER ROOM is a very impressive movie!  It is a bit like Oliver Stone's WALL STREET, and Sydney Pollack's THE FIRM. But it does stand on it's own, since this is the story of not successful brokers or attorney's but of young men who have no where to really go, but to this firm which seems so promising and great, when it's not.  It's almost like the Pied Piper of Hamlen.

While advertised as another half ass Ben Affleck POS, the heartthrob hack actually makes just a cameo.  Affleck plays a recruiter at a sketchy brokerage firm deep in long island.  Among his new recruits is Giovanni Ribisi, who gives a brilliant performance as a trainee learning the ropes.  It is Ribisi who elevates what would otherwise have been a lame movie.Ribisi's character takes a job at a cut-throat brokerage to please his judicial father.  The I-want-my-father-to-love-me character is nothing new to late 20th century film, but Ribisi brings a new patience and sense of purpose to the archetype that makes him easier to identify with.  Eventually Ribisi suspects that things might be legally amiss at this too-good-to-be-true firm, but by then he has his own moral issues to deal with.The script is insightful, from the observation that stock brokering is the white man's slinging crack rock, to the slinging epithet's and flying fists that grow from the machismo of male greed.

I didn't buy that Ribisi could take the abuse of the guy he worked under. This guy and the guy who beats the sh-t out of the guy in the bar are complete assholes! I know they were supposed to be but I didn't find the characters strong enough, full enough to warrant putting up with these creeps. I know that it's the money but the mad charge that's supposed to be the trading business didn't come through for me. I got the, otherwise jarring use of rap, the suits, the Dad, the girl but I didn't get the excitement of trading and selling that I think was key to making this film move. Anybody who has worked in sales or has cold-called will laugh at the notion that this could be a lot of fun. Affleck's posturing here was BS. That cracky, weak voice and that blank look in the eyes had me waiting for the director to yell CUT!

But this WAS a very different film that deserves to be considered on it's own merits, despite it's obvious heritage.What we get in Boiler Room is an effectively told story about complex people and richly drawn relationships.  Seemingly unsympathetic characters in the early going soon become very human, familiar and surprisingly sympathetic. The insight and detail of the world of the `chop shop' felt authentic and engaging. The dialog was punchy, funny and interesting when it needed to be (most notably Ben Affleck's cameos), with many thoughtful and tender moments to provide effective counterpoint (especially the scenes between Giovanni Ribisi as Seth and Ron Rifkin and Seth's father). Most certainly, this relationship and these scenes were the heart of the film, and ultimately make it the effective and moving one it is.

In fact it can almost be summed up as being a younger sibling or even a juvenile parody of these classics.For the new generation of financial swashbucklers, Boiler Room may have a mixed impact as it displays the highs of making a serious amount of cake in a short period of time, but it also has the downside of the unethical and cut-throat breech of trust involved in the selfish pursuit of making the first million.Affleck plays the most influential part in the movie as the bizarro Tony Robbins brainwasher/company big-dog, and his role is very captivating.The real conclusion the laymen can make from this flick is never trust the hard sell broker unless you really do your homework.

I feel that he was woefully miscast as the hero of this film. Mind you, I am a fan of the anti-hero, but I felt that the script was too cut and paste in dealing with his transformation from morally ambiguous to upstanding hero of the film. I felt that scenes with his family were never fleshed out enough, and left me wanting to see more in order to understand any of his motivation.Having said that, the supporting cast was superior. Ben Affleck does a mean Alec Baldwin impersonation, and somehow steals almost every scene he is in. Strangely enough, I felt like the best performance in the film was turned in by relative newcomer Vin Diesel. Diesel internalizes his role, showing that he actually wants to buy into the lies that have been spread by the firms managing partners, and brings a physical vitality to the movie that Ribisi seriously lacks.

Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Nicky Katt, Scott Caan, and Jamie Kennedy are names that are not highly recognizable now but in five years these guy will most likely be making the blockbuster hits and bringing home the big checks.  Getting past the great cast, Boiler Room was a highly enjoyable film.  The leads are great and the story line is simple but firm.  The only time the film fails is when it strays too much from the main plot.  The familial aspect of Giovanni Ribisi and his father pauses much of the momentum and tension the films tries to build up.  However that is a miniscule setback to a fun, if not deep, film.

You know this film surprised a lot of people.Don't think for a minute that Boiler Room is simply a film about the stock market and testosterone-fuelled drama. It's more a story about a young man's struggle to make his father proud, a tough act in this case, since the boy and his dad have little in common.Watch Boiler Room for the simple fact that it does what good drama should. It pits likeable characters up against their own moral makeup and asks them to decide what's right.And keep an eye on Giovanni Ribisi as one of tomorrow's brightest stars. Unless 2000 gives us a lot more than 1999 did in the way of truly thought-provoking and sympathetic roles, his performance in Boiler Room deserves an Academy Award nomination.

It was nice to see him return to his original heel type of part.  It's a nice variation on a few different themes like greed and acceptance and morals.

The picture ostensibly looks at a boiler room operation through which stocks are sold over the telephone.  But it is really looking at the climate of greed that is thriving in America today and producing young men and women whose goal isn't to make anything except money.It's a mentality we see in real life everywhere from Wall Street to the TV studios where Who wants to be a millionaire is taped. It's turning America into the get rich quick scheme capital of the universe.Boiler Room is well acted, with Giovanni Ribsi excellent as the tough little guy who goes from operating an illegal casino in his home to being an up and coming stock trader for a firm he quickly learns isn't exactly on the up and up.Also good performances from Nia Long as his girlfriend and Ben Affleck playing essentially the same role Alec Baldwin made memorable in Glengary/Glenrose.The only complaint here is that this film, like a lot of Hollywood pictures these days, has trouble pulling off its third act.  The ending is a little abrupt and unsatisfying. It builds to what should have been a big finish, but the fuse sort of goes out before it reaches the gunpowder.This film is well worth seeing anyway. But it may be a picture that bothers some people who stop long enough to wonder whether these hustlers are really all that different from a lot of upwardly mobile young Americans today.

Even though he is very successful with his venture, late-night gambler Greg Weinstein (Nicky Katt) piques his curiosity with an offer of employment with very lucrative benefits.  He is ultimately introduced to the high-energy world of brokers which creates unimaginable risks and opportunities for Seth.This is a fine film about some very unsavory characters, those for whom the golden rule means acquire the gold by any means.  In the lead role Giovanni Ribisi portrays a restless young man, eager for success, but beset with self-doubt.  Years of turmoil with his demanding father, Marty, a respected judge played by Ron Rifkin, have left him scarred yet still yearning for his father's acceptance.  Marty cares deeply for Seth too, though he is unable to express his love and only focuses on his son's shortcomings.  The father-son relationship in the film, the key to Seth's drive, is very well done, though it came close to falling into a cliché several times.  Another quite interesting aspect of the film is the view it gives into the world of unscrupulous stockbrokers operating out of a boiler room, a term applied to a telephone-intensive sales operation.  There are a number of despicable characters here, those who long ago sold out for the sure-fire formula for personal wealth.  Good supporting roles by Ben Affleck, Vin Diesel and Nia Long as Debbie, the secretary who shows an interest in Seth, add to the enjoyment.  But there are a few problems that prevented it from being great. Though it was well-edited overall I was put off by some of the MTV-style editing on the transition scenes, where every shot was two seconds or less and punctuated by a pervasive rap background.  Even more distracting was a significant number of key scenes involving close-ups that were out of focus. This was an inexcusable lapse in cinematography.

No, he opts for the most honorable career a high-pressure broker for JT Marlin, an obscure financial company, that may not be on the up and up. With a raging bull market, brokers receiving multimillion-dollar bonuses and a new twenty-something-dot-com-whiz kid becoming a billionaire every week, it was inevitable that someone would try to make a movie about this subject.  It's a shame that this had to be the one. The brokers of JT Marlin consider Wall Street - the decade defining movie that so perfectly captured the extravagantly excessive consumerism of the 80's- to be their Holy Grail.  As you watch them chomp on cigars and take turns reciting the dialogue you realize the problem with the film - they are mouthing the whole thing.Wall Street gave us solid characters and regardless whether you admired or reviled them, they rang true Gordon Gekko, the robber baron with the requisite combination of charisma, style and evil was an Armani shark with soul while Bud Fox, the poor naïf who is seduced by wealth and power and ultimately destroyed by conscience could be anyman.  In stark contrast, the characters in Boiler are paper cut outs - a gang of uncouth, racist punks - and I didn't believe them or care about their problems.   In addition, had they spent more time on the plot rather than dwelling on the boot camp environment at the firm, (which quickly gets repetitive and stale) it might have taken more than ten minutes to figure out the entire plot.

The only question is how many times over.Quite frankly, I expected this to be absolute crap.  I'm not much of a fan any of the cast, I'm not familiar with the director, and the premise sounded like a bad television movie. But Boiler Room turned out to be a fairly entertaining Gen-X spin on flashy, corrupt stockbrokers. The main character Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) is a smart guy, but college isn't really for him. He drops out to run a successful illegal casino from his apartment. But when an old friend offers him an opportunity to work for a lesser known, maverick trading company, Seth jumps at the chance to make a lot of money legitimately, and possibly repair his strained relationship with his father, as a result. But, while Seth's natural talent for selling makes him a rising star at the firm, he slowly finds out that his new employer may not be quite so legitimate, after all.The story is pretty ridiculous, and it's portrayal of stock trading is more entertaining than realistic. But hey, it's a movie, not a documentary. The supposed party-lives of the hotshot young brokers are a little over the top (shooting dice, really?), and the relationship between Seth and Abby (Nia Long) is undercooked and seems to not have much significance within the plot, but his interactions with his stern, disapproving father (Ron Rifkin) are much more resonant.Boiler Room name-checks Glengarry Glen Ross and Wall Street, but it's not quite up to the challenge of being a more recent version of those movies.

Giovanni Ribisi plays the main character who joins a major stock brokerage firm, promising great success and rewards to its employees. The problem, the leaders, all seemingly under 35, are so arrogant and conceited that they engage in some of the most immoral and unethical business practices imaginable. When Ribisi sees how a client he handled gets swindled into losing his life savings, he does investigations of his own, and in the end, the FBI raids the company.Boiler Room does suffer a bit, not for lack of suspense. These things, shockingly could happen, but we do have some very conceited, arrogant punks as main characters who are growing up too fast, vulgar, cruel, and even disrespectful to their own employees without any sense of right and wrong. Credibility is strained, and Seth (Giovanni's character) should have realized that these bastards were up to no good right from his first day at the firm. Many questions are left unanswered as to how people with such a prick attitude got their positions in the first place. I was bothered by the characters of Michael the firm's leader, and his main brokerage trainer Greg. These two do not represent any positive leadership. I would hope that teens and young adults watching this film understand the way that these pricks conducted business was reprehensible.The main problem with Boiler Room is that there is such a disdain for the heads of the firm, with their deception and brain-washing business practices, that the anger you feel with them picking fights, and basically being a$$holes to most everyone around them, detracts from the suspense of the movie. When Seth tries to make amends by trying to get back the money that his client lost in the end, it's a little too late to care. Additionally, the rap music did not coincide well with the dialog or scenes in which it was used.However, you will hate overly pushy salespeople and telemarketers after watching this film! The phone dialogs are decent, quick, and sharp. Unfortunately, there is still a cruel edge on the other characters, except Ribisi, which seems to make Boiler Room not quite as good as it could have been.

Some friends from a telemarketing brokerage drop by and tells him he can make 10 times as much with little effort. How? become a stock broker.Giovanni Ribisi renders a credible performance as Seth Davis sharpie at card tricks but neophyte in the brokerage racket. Seth attends the initial seminar where he's told they're not really interested in brokers but really making salesmen out of them. Their offices are an unpartitioned sea of desks and telephone hook ups, but all personnel must dress the look of success.

When I first watched it, I wasn't expecting too much. However, I was so impressed with the witty dialog, the flashy characters and the sky's-the-limit premise, that I could not turn it off and I've since watched it many times over again.It starts out with Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) who is a recent college dropout. He is able to make a good living running a 24-7 poker game from his apartment. However, he is the midst of a moral crisis. On one hand, he wants to make a lot of money, which he is able to do through his poker parlor. But on the other hand, he wants to satisfy his hard-to-please father who is a judge and does not approve of his illegal venture. He soon runs into a childhood friend who turns him on to a job which will seemingly allow him to do both.Seth starts working at the stock-selling firm JT Marlin which is miles away from Wall Street, both literally and figuratively. While there, he is surrounded by several aggressive, type-A personalities who are f***ing millionaires but have little in the way of discipline or morals. The movie does a great job in illustrating the kind of lifestyle that they lead. They live in huge mansions, are seen driving fancy cars, go out to classy bars and expensive restaurants, etc, etc.His co-workers are wonderfully played by Ben Affleck, Vin Diesel, Nick Katt, and Thomas Everett Scott. Affleck has a relatively small role as the head recruiter who gives clever and motivational speeches to the trainees. His main purpose in the film is for comic relief, which he seems to have a knack for. Diesel, not usually know for his acting, gives a solid performance as fast-talking Chris Varick, who is the master at closing out clients over the phone. Katt plays Greg, a broker who takes Seth under his wing but soon becomes jealous of Seth and his quick rise to the top. It was a little bit disappointing that his character did not play as prominent of a role in the ending. I was expecting some kind of climax to the tension that was building up between him and Seth. However, the build-up seemed to be wasted in the end. Scott has a disappointingly small role as the two-faced head of the firm, Michael Brantley. He could have been a really interesting character in the movie but unfortunately very little time was devoted to him.As Seth gets settled in to the firm and becomes very good at his job, he begins to question how the firm is able to legally pay out the large sums of money to its brokers. He soon finds out that everything is not all that it is cracked up to be. He goes from an innocent pawn with dreams of being a millionaire to a conscientious sympathizer who feels bad about the damage that he unknowingly has done. Toward the end, you begin to notice a change in both his demeanor and appearance. Ribisi, in one of his first starring roles, does a magnificent job in portraying Seth through his metamorphosis.The biggest flaw in this movie is the romance between Seth and Abbie (Nia Long). I felt the movie could have better without it as it only really slowed down an otherwise fast-paced and entertaining movie. Its only purpose is to create tension between Seth and Greg (which never gets resolved) and to set Seth up for the ultimate betrayal (which could have been done by other means).By the end, you (and Seth) begin to ask the question of What if.

It doesn't matter what the characters are selling because it all comes down to closing and what lengths the characters will go to to get the sale.  I loved Tin Men, Used Cars, Death of a Salesmen, Glengary Glen Ross and of course, Wall Street, but Boiler Room is the one that I can identify with more than any of the others, mainly because it's all guys around my age and (sadly) I can relate to many of the tactics used in the film.  Giovanni Ribisi is never bad (in my book) and I consider Nicky Katt to be one of Hollywood's most underrated.  Not to mention, I'm a huge Ben Affleck fan and even though his performance is brief here, he's excellent and you WILL remember his first scene as one of the film's highlights.  It looks like nearly every review here has gone through the plot and at least every other review has talked about the sublots involving Seth's father and his love interest, so I'm not going there either.  I entered the world of sales a little over a year ago, and even though Boiler Room had been out for a while, I still hadn't seen it.  Like the guys in the movie, I was lured into sales by the fast money and the after-hours lifestyle that seemed to naturally accompany it.  Ben Younger obviously knows a lot about the profession and the lifestyle.  Hats off to him for painting a realistic portrait of what it's like to be a young sales person.

So for me it is kind of funny hearing how Greg (Nicky Katt) explains to Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) the rules about how to make good phone calls (Always Be Closing, don't pitch the bitch), because I still remember those exact same rules from my work.What I do not like are the scenes with Seth and his father (actually I do not like Ron Rifkin's character at all, he is only interested in his career as a federal judge and what the people would think of him). Seth is trying to get approval and love from his father, but his whining is quite annoying, especially the scene where Seth actually breaks into tears.Also I think the interactions between Seth and Abbie (Nia Long) are superfluous, they do not advance the plot. Maybe they are just put into the film to attract the female audience?And I find the ending a little disappointing because too many questions remain unanswered.But overall I like the film.The acting is quite superb, the whole cast gives a strong performance. I think Giovanni Ribisi as the leading man carries the film quite well (although I would not buy a movie ticket just because he is in a film). From the supporting actors I like Ron Rifkin (although I don't like the character he plays), and even Ben Affleck when he delivers his speech during the interview at the beginning of the movie. And I like Vin Diesel in the buddy role with Giovanni Ribisi. In this film you can actually see that he is a talented actor. In fact the week I saw Boiler Room the first time, I also watched Pitch Black the first time and I was amazed at how well he played those totally different characters in both films.

I'm a finance major, and saw a few cracks in the script (like issuing IPO stock to small, first time investors) and play enough blackjack to know that no one should hit a 16 when the dealer will most likely bust. No biggie, the cars are great. Nicky Katt drives a Ferrari f355, yellow, and they actually show them cruising in it (instead of the typical movie where it just sits looking pretty). Vin Diesel drives a Range Rover, Ben Affleck drives a Diablo or a Lotus (just sits there in front of his house/work).

Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel once again show why they're slowly replacing Affleck and perennial sidekick Matt Damon as the hottest young actors in Hollywood. Ben Younger cast this movie perfectly; unfortunately, that's about the only thing he did right.Younger's auspicious debut focuses on Seth Davis (Ribisi, probably best known to most as lightning boy from a memorable X-Files episode), a college dropout running an illegal casino in his living room. Pressured by his father (Ron Rifkin), a supreme court justice to stop his illegal activity, Seth is ripe for the plucking by his childhood friend Greg (Nicky Katt, now playing the hapless sub on Boston Public), who's a senior broker at a chop-shop style stock brokerage. Davis finds out he's very good at being a salesman, and while Greg turns a seemingly inexplicable cold eye to Seth, a rival senior broker, Chris (Diesel), takes Davis under his wing. Greg and Chris are the kinds of friends who are constantly on the edge of exploding into violence with constant putdowns; not surprising in a high-stress job like this.The whole firm is run by Jim Young (Affleck) and his pal Michael (Thom Everett Scott), and it becomes obvious to Davis as time goes on that something fishy is happening, but he finds this out while realizing that he's good at being fishy. This leads to an ethical crisis, and... well, see the movie.Ribisi, Diesel, and the usually-laconic Scott deliver the goods here in the best of ways. Affleck is his usual self, and one wonders if he'll ever play anything else. The ensemble cast-- and despite the focus on Ribisi's character, this is as much an ensemble movie as Glengarry Glen Ross or The Big Chill-- is perfect, and many of the minor characters (Nia Long, Scott Caan, and the woefully-underutilized Jon Abrahams) deliver performances up to the same standard set by the big guns. But Younger takes a potentially explosive situation and, instead of focusing on the characters and their interactions through the whole movie, shoves that part of the dynamic to the back in the last half, opting instead for a stock plot. Perhaps Younger should have read King's book; focusing on his characters instead of plotting things out would almost certainly have resulted in a much better film, since that first hour shows he really does have a grasp of what makes humans work. Still, it's worth renting just to catch a few performances by stars who are definitely on their way to the top. ** 1/2  "},{"Title":"I had to rate in the middle","Date":"5 September 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Boiler Room wasn't a bad movie, but I wouldn't call it a good movie either.

Here it was so grounded in reality that it was absolutely frightening; I kept saying a prayer over and over Please God, don't let my sons turn out like this. I came home and pinned my 15 year old and lectured him about money not being everything and that he should never let himself get entrapped in an unethical situation. There are some plot points that don't quite work, with the guy's father (DA Morgenthau in yesterday's New York Times decried the legal aspects as ridiculous), but I did appreciate the novelty today of a script that has a guy see the moral light not through the cliché of the love of a good woman (the only woman here is as ethically compromised as he is for similar motivations) but rather of love for his father (reminded me of East of Eden a smidgen).Ben Affleck is in the movie for only minutes, but is effective. Ribisi is absolutely fantastic, and his relationship with Ron Rifkin as the father quite believable. Vin Diesel was so good (he almost makes us believe that he's Italian-American though he's clearly something else) that now I'd be willing to see his action movies.Some critics have disparaged that this is just a junior Wall Street and Glengarry Glen Ross -- but the touchstones those movies as karaoke provide are key to this movie. First, this is very much about the '90's and '00's for a younger generation, complete with very hip hop soundtrack (another popular cultural push about get-rich-quick-myths).Second, I just read a history on the impact of 19th century self-improvement books, and this shows that these movies are functioning like that (shades of Gen X's who learn history from movies like Stone's JFK).

Everything is running pretty smoothly and even though his father (the judge) doesn't approve, he doesn't turn him in either. An old acquaintance stops by with a buddy. Tells Seth that they like to recruit him into their firm. Nothing is said as to WHY Seth is the right guy for the job. Maybe it's because he's running a successful casino in his apartment. Still, his friend Adam (Jamie Kennedy) and the recruiter (Greg - Nicky Katt) don't tell us why. So Seth, after cleaning Greg out of some cash at the casino table, takes the offer and head to the interview the next day. There they meet Jim (Ben Affleck) who dismisses two people right of the bat. I won't tell you why. See the movie. Affleck is excellent in these type of roles. Like his counter part Matt Damon, Ben is great at speak loud and fast with lots of emotion. He give the interviewees the load down on how to make a million dollars just 3 years. Everyone buys the pitch and it's off to training.**** Light Spoilers ****Seth does his three months of training under the mean spirited Greg who thinks that Seth is out to steal his old girlfriend Abbie (Nia Long). Even though Abbie dumped Greg weeks ago and is taking a liking to Seth. Still Greg believe that Seth is trying to step over him as Seth starts to close stock deals at a rapid rate.

Then he sees Michael (Tom Everett Scott) looking for a larger leasing office. Nothing is mention about how Michael because CEO of the company, but everyone respects his leadership none the less. When FBI agents start getting involved things turn for the worse. I won't give anymore of it away. You'll just have to see it for yourself. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the way it ended. I would have liked it to have gone on for another 10-15 mins to see what ended up happening in the office. The original ending on the DVD was even worse. Again, you really want to see the next 10-15 mins after the movie ends. Also, the premise was really far fetched. The firm seemed to have been around for a long time and I find it very hard to believe that people would buy stocks over the phone with a company that's not recognizable. Even if they are recognizable, most high stock purchasers either already have a broker or do it themselves online. Also, the people who were losing all this money would have eventually hired a detective to investigate the situation. I can see it happening, but not on the scale that was involved in the movie. Rich people aren't as dumb as the film made them out to be. I would also think that the employees calling would wonder why they are selling stock for companies that are going out of business. Also the rips - (commission) were way to high.Overall the movie is worth a rental. It's worth watching a couple of times. I own the DVD, but will probably sell it after a couple more viewings.

So many movies end up using topicality as mere window dressing to gussy up otherwise conventional screenplays that, when a film arrives on the scene that is truly attuned to the truths of its time, it becomes something of a revelation.  How many recent thrillers, for instance, have simply turned to high tech computer hardware in an attempt to infuse a little novelty into stories that otherwise creak with old age?`Boiler Room' is a different story altogether.  Even though, at its most basic level, this film taps into themes that trace their origins all the way back to the earliest ancient Greek tragedies, somehow `Boiler Room' manages to convey a vision of the world that is uniquely modern and chillingly contemporary in its character.  In this era in which Wall Street has become the new American icon and in which even the most ill-informed common citizen is led to believe that he can become a millionaire almost overnight with virtually no financial risk merely by making a few shrewd investments in an ever-expanding stock market, any number of opportunists crouch poised for the kill, ready to spring on the unsuspecting investor and take him for all he is worth.  This is the world `Boiler Room' opens up to us.Commendably, writer/director Ben Younger realizes (as so many others have not) that, in the world of drama, moral ambiguity is always more fascinating than colorless, good-vs.-evil simplicity.  As a result, he has chosen, as the center of his complex screenplay, a young man, Seth Davis, who is, from the first moment we meet him, knee deep in the world of shady entrepreneurial skullduggery.  Having quit college to run an underground casino out of his off-campus apartment, Seth jumps at the chance to move onto bigger and better things when he is offered a position at an `off Wall Street' stock brokerage firm that assures him he will be making a cool million dollars before his third year with the company is up.  Thus, Seth becomes a symbol for so many young people today who have become so dazzled by the prospect of a near-instant wealth that seems just within their grasp that they abandon all thoughts of morality and decency in their blind race to the goal.  And, indeed, one of the most insidiously effective scenes in the film is the inspirational pep talk that Ben Affleck delivers to the raw recruits at the beginning of the film.  So dazzling and convincing is the speech and so inspirational and passionate its delivery that even we in the audience feel like we are missing out on a great thing.  For, of course, Seth slowly learns that all is not true-blue and on the up-and-up in this firm as he discovers that he is indeed involved with a financial `chop shop' whose sole business it is to rip off weak, vulnerable and unsuspecting men looking for a few good investments.What is most admirable about this film is that, as Seth begins to realize the truth of the situation, he doesn't turn suddenly noble and righteous as he might in the hands of a less sophisticated author.   Instead, he begins to think of ways to benefit himself financially by betraying the very scammers who have taken him into their operation.  In fact, it is only after he is arrested by the FBI that Seth finally sees the need to do the right thing and to make restitution to the two men whose lives he has truly ruined - a young Wisconsin man whose marriage crumbles after he allows Seth to talk him into blowing his new-home down payment on a phony stock and Seth's own father, a morally upright federal judge, who in a moment of filial weakness, tries to help Seth with an illegal action and ends up getting implicated in the FBI probe as a result.  However, Seth is not a thoroughly bad person; he is neither ruthless nor heartless, yet he has an enormous ability to rationalize his immoral actions within the common framework of achieving that instant wealth he somehow feels he is owed, despite the fact that his father certainly does not reflect that thinking.  In fact, the relationship between Seth and his father underlines the moral complexity of Younger's tale.  We feel for Seth because he has lived his whole life yearning to earn his father's respect yet making all the wrong choices in his quest to garner it.  Yet, we also empathize with a father, caught between trying to model a sense of moral rectitude and maintain his own spotless reputation as a judge yet, at the same time, desiring to provide help for his child in need.And these are, after all, little more than twenty-something children dressed up as adults, an incongruity that Younger captures with uncanny brilliance. Despite the fact that they are involving themselves in million dollar deals and ruining countless lives in the process, these `men' have advanced little beyond the stage of frat-boy rambunctiousness in their behavior.  We see them erupting into fistfights at local yuppie bars with similarly well-dressed members of a competing firm; we hear, pouring liberally out of their mouths, vehemently racist, woman-bashing and gay-bashing comments that solidify the exclusiveness of the world to which they belong; we witness them reciting verbatim, almost as if it were Holy Scripture, lines of dialogue from the movie that has become an emblem for their generation - not `Star Wars' but Oliver Stone's `Wall Street.'And, just as Younger forces us to identify with the hunger these men have for instantaneous financial success, he, even more effectively, helps us to identify with the poor ill-informed schmucks who are at the other end of the phone, being railroaded into making decisions they feel powerless to control.  So bedazzled are they (and we) by the dizzying barrage of alien terminology pouring forth from the other end of the receiver that capitulation seems inevitable.  For its glimpse into the inner workings of boiler rooms alone, the film earns its kudos as a fascinating experience.The outstanding cast is headed by Giovanni Ribisi, who creates a subtle portrait of a young man torn between his better angels - in the form of his own innate conscience and a beautiful young woman who is also a part of the firm - and the bitter demons of a morally bankrupt, value-free grab for instant wealth.  The remainder of the cast is equally impressive.   There is literally in this film, not a single character of potential `goodness' - not Seth, not the firm's secretary (Nia Long), not Seth's parents - who is not, at one point or another, forced to confront a great moral dilemma and found wanting.  This is the kind of narrative courage that defines `Boiler Room' from beginning to end.Younger, in his quiet way, paints as terrifying a picture of youths caught in a world of white-collar crime as many others have done portraying those living and surviving in the meanest drug-ridden gang-infested sections of our inner cities.  Perhaps, this is even more horrifying because these upwardly mobile youths - so full of promise, so full of talent, so full of the attributes it takes to get ahead - betoken the kind of society we will ultimately become.  What a bleak picture Younger paints of a future world totally bereft of moral values.  His brave, complex film becomes a chilling cautionary tale that we ignore at our peril.

The central prodigious son vs. stern father theme comes straight from Potok's The Chosen.The true major structural chop is from Goodfellas -- the narration begins at a point where Ribisi is reflective, we jump back in time and a large portion of the movie is spent on getting us back to that first scene. Likewise, there is the wanton violence; all of the energy comes from the character level. The investment in the world, in the narrative space, is close to nil.The missed opportunity here is plain when you compare this to something like Fallen, which makes smart use of the trusted narrator to con us.

Although his pep talks were generally scathing and peppered with swear words, which could have been replaced with a more menacing and meaningful performance. The odd push and shove and bad words here and there didn't convey that it was a place not for the fainthearted, it's a tougher in any restaurant kitchen you care to mention! I found the music/montage scenes awkward, with a little flurry of jump cuts that only appeared briefly and upset the flow of the film for me.The whole story was played out in too simplistic a way. Everything was set up and then knocked down by numbers, nothing left to interpretation or thought. The FBI character development was weak and seemed like an afterthought inserted into the film afterwards.The single 'example' character that Ribisi sold a bum deal to was also weak as as a kitten. We see him buy the deal, then decide to buy more, his wife then kicks up about him spending the money, then he sees the stock rise then wants to sell but Ribisi just can't-or lose serious face and credibility with his seniors. It's just so obvious and drama by numbers again, we see his wife and kids getting their coats on and him sobbing head in hands on the stairs at the end of the panned shot. He sold loads of deals and we only really see a single character and what he experiences and then it's done so badly it's embarrassing. We don't get to see the real depths of what he has done, or even guess because we are not privy to what he did.The film starts at an event that is in actual fact near the end of the film, then we go back and slowly catch up with the starting events, but there was no point to this I thought.The film ended without any real cadence to it, kind of fizzled out. All in all a pretty poor film with nothing cerebral about it at all, but fairly solid acting (even Vin Diesel was good!) with good support from the father and affleck, high production values but let down by a poor script, loose editing and possibly unimpassioned direction.

Greg and Michael are young and successful brokers and they invite Seth to join them at company called J.T. Marlin. Finally Seth thinks that he's doing something that would please his dad and something that is legal. Seth soon meets brokers like Jim Young (Ben Affleck) and Chris Varick (Vin Diesel), nice secretary Abbie Halpert (Nia Long); but he also begins to realize what are people at J.T. Marlin selling to others.After very good movies like Wall Street and Glengarry Glen Ross, we've got another story about brokers named Boiler Room. Boiler Room is definitely not better from these two movies but it represents watchable movie and that is not bad. Maybe there are some clichés like the love story between Seth and Abbie or very stretched relationship between Seth and his dad (we've seen it all before), but as I said before you can easily pass over that. Ribisi is good in main role and I also liked Diesel (except that last scene on stairs). The acting coming from Affleck is very bad and he wasted some of the best lines this script has to offer. Ben Younger did a good job in his directorial debut, but his movie suffers from innovative plot ideas that could take it on to another level (the ending).

Whereas Wall Street was able to pull off a romantic side, a dramatic side, a comedic side, a political and economic side, and a dysfunctional side, Boiler Room is able to do no such thing. At the end, we realise that the film has bit off so much, that it could only present a half-baked story regarding each of these separate avenues, whereas it would have been much better alleviating certain avenues (eg, potential romance) and instead focus on showing the high life, and thus what is tempting our protagonist.Vin Diesel is quite good in his limited scenes (once more, key characters and relationships were severely underdeveloped, and we have literally no care for what happens to these people). Ribisi is excellent in scenes that challenge him. Nia Long, honestly, doesn't seem to serve much purpose, but makes do with what's presented to her.Ultimately, you don't really know what to make of this film - whilst you will enjoy many of its parts, it is difficult to really get a grasp on what the film is trying to say, as you get the impression that it may be trying to say SOMETHING. What that something is, is very indiscernible, and is testament to the early stages of the filmmaker's career. Whilst talent is evident in some of the facets explored, this film didn't understand its priorities - it could never be Wall Street, yet it tried to be, and in doing so focused on too much without giving any real development or depth to any one particular part of the story.A decent effort, but a patchy one - you really won't get anything out of this, but it's worth renting out anyway - just for those few nuggets of gold you see in what is otherwise a pretty ordinary little rock.

However, what separates this movie is that it is so in touch with it's time and place. It settles around the Generation X frustration and feeling of lacking in purpose and identity (although not nearly as in depth as David Fincher's masterpiece 'Fight Club'). The world of these frustrated men is a melting pot of testosterone, materialism, misogyny, pent up rage and the desire to get rich quick. In fact, Younger throws so much in here as admirable as the efforts he starts dropping the balls halfway through. Our hero is Giavanni Rabisi as Seth who goes from a nice illegal home casino to a fast talking rising star at a chop shop. He is our hero because he redeems himself somewhat and seems to have a slightly higher moral compass then everyone else in the movie. However, for much of the movie we feel detached from Seth. We, as the audience aren't sure if we can trust him and this weighs in as a big problem when so much of the movie focuses on him and his emotional struggles. Rabisi does a fine job, but Younger hasn't written a character here that is quite compelling enough to hold an entire film together. The movie starts to falter when it goes down it's many subplots involving Seth wooing the receptionist (Nia Long), trying to gain the acceptance of his father (Ron Rifken) and an ever closer FBI investigation into the chop shop. The movie works best when it's in the boiler room and around the guys. Some of this, and the guys themselves, is genuinely frightening. That idea of answering the phone one day and ending up being bilked out of your life savings. That is why one of the subplots, following William Fictner as a poor guy that Seth swindles, is so effective and moving. More so then much of Seth's exploits. The cast is all around top notch and Younger has penned some great, obscenity laced dialogue for them. Ben Affleck stands out with memorable monologues in a near cameo role. Visually Younger is confined to lengthy shots of city streets and traffic going by for transitions. He throws so many elements out there and then doesn't have a place to take many of them. While the movie starts to sag in it's 3rd act I did - unlike many - really like the ending. It's as if Younger decided that the movie will be like life where not everything gets resolved and he decides to pull it just before it would have dwindled into a more sappy, conventional movie-ending. It works and it has things to say - that aren&#145;t spelled out for you -  but you still may not remember it the next day.

It's just a refreshing movie to watch as you see Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) slip into this different world of Wall Street and how far he goes. I saw this film being a fan of Ribisi and was very impressed by his work in the film. The writing is great. I really liked the way Seth and his dad (Ron Rifkin) didn't have the perfect father-son relationship as one might expect. This is also the movie that made me like Vin Diesel (who plays Chris). Many people really got hooked on Diesel after 'The Fast and the Furious' and 'XXX' but this was the film that made me enjoy him. Diesel does a really good job in the film and it made me believe Diesel would go on to be a pretty good actor. Unfortunately the roles he selects now make all his actual acting talents lay dormant and unnecessary (such as with 'XXX'). But to get back with the movie, it's probably one of the best films of 2000 and Ben Younger (writer/director) should have got some sort of nomination for his screenplay. This ranks under one of the very few tens I give.*I would also recommend watching Wall Street and Glengarry Glen Ross.

Along the way he falls for the beautiful secretary (Nia Long) and gets deeper and deeper into illegal activities that literally make his casino look like child's play.Very nice performances from Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel.This movie basically would like to be a sequel to Olliver Stone's Wall Street, and in one segment, the crooks try to outdo eachother in their ability to recount scenes from that movie. What is good about this movie is the testosterone soaked atmosphere of burning ambition, lots of money (apparently) and... beautiful women? But wait a minute, apart from secretary Nia Long, where are the girls? Where is Daryl Hannah? Where are Shaun Young, where are the beautiful aides and secretaries and where's the highflying prostitute? Do these boys even have girlfriends?Another  problem is that because Ribisi starts out doing wrong and unlike Bud Fox, doesn't get slowly sucked into compromising his ideals more and more, you're not slowly reeled in like in Wall Street. There is no obvious virtue versus temptation. Whereas Gekko looks every bit the respectable business man with a degree, money to manage andinvestment bankers knocking at his door, Affleck is never more than a used car salesman, with Diesel as his cheerleader. There is no journey from honest but ambitious to hopelessly compromised. In fact, where Gekko's business is legit, Affleck's is never more than a tele-sales operation.There is of course the son-father relationship, like in Wall Street, but it seems forced, although it might be Boiler Room's strongest point.Still, of all the films I would see again, this is at the top of my list.

With the emergence of Vin Diesel as a star and with the presence (although a minor one) of Ben Affleck also in the cast, however, The Boiler Room will probably benefit from a new interest among the casual browsers of the neighborhood Blockbuster.The title refers to the high pressure telephone sales area of an unscrupulous brokerage house which earns its brokers large commissions by dumping inflated stocks on unsuspecting investors (the soon-to-be worthless securities are simply part of a larger scheme of fraud by the brokerage proprietors).  Watching the operation of this organization is very enlightening, as were the sequences dealing with the recruiting and training' of the phone brokers themselves.The movie, set in New York City and the surrounding area, follows the story of one such broker trainee, Seth.  An enterprising young man in his own way, Seth has dropped out of college to run a small scale illegal gambling casino out of his apartment in Queens, which caters to the gambling needs of his former Queens College classmates.  The discovery of this unsavory lifestyle exacerbates the strained relationship between Seth, and his father, a Federal judge.  (This sub-plot of the relationship between Seth and his father gets a bit heavy handed as the movie progresses, but it's not too distracting).Exposed to the possibility of great financial gain through work as a stock broker by an old neighborhood friend who comes calling at the apartment casino with a large roll of bills, and eager to make amends with his father, Seth dutifully attends the group interview to which his old friend has invited him.  Surprisingly enough, Seth notes, the office is not in downtown Manhattan in the Wall Street area, but in fact is farther out away from the City in a nondescript Long Island office complex.  This theme of New York and the outsiders- the Long Island brokers striving for acceptance (though ostentacious displays of money) is one of the major messages of the film, and is very well done.Central to the plot is a relationship which develops between an attractive secretary at the firm and Seth.  This is significant because she was previously involved with Seth's friend, now the senior broker for whom Seth toils making cold calls to computer generated investment targets (those annoying calls we all get during dinner).  This aspect of the film and the plot is the weakest, as some scenes or dialogue in which this relationship takes wing are utterly missing from the movie, but it's useful in facilitating the falling out between Seth and this sponsor.Seth ran a gambling den, but respected his clients and the market he served.  As he comes to know the true nature of the swindles his new employer is running, he is torn between the attraction of the financial reward (and respect of his Father for a legitimate profession and the realization of what these worthless investments are doing to the people whom he cajoles into parting with their hard earned money.  Central to this, and very well portrayed in the movie, is the actual shallowness of the lives of the successful brokers; they have big houses and fancy cars, but no furniture, and must live paycheck to paycheck to support their inflated lifestyles- still shutout from inclusion among the real financial circles in the City.  They are vulger, crude and outcasts; hardly a good career recommendation.An undercover sting by the SEC and the FBI snares Seth (this too, seems to be lacking in exposition) forcing him to fully realize in what type of outfit he is involved, and what to do about it.  This would seem to borrow too closely from Wall Street, which itself is featured prominently, with lines from the movie recited as a mantra by the brokers in mansion devoid of furnishings save for a big screen TV and a tanning booth.For the inside view of life in Queens, and inside the lowest element of the financial services industry, this movie provides an excellent glimpse.  It's worth investing some time.

The only really promising detail that I could think of was that Affleck was in this movie, and as we all know...Affleck is a movie-maker. But regardless of how I felt about the rest of the cast -- and the concept for that matter, I watched the film, mostly because it was on cable. In the beginning, it was very slow...I was about to pop in Reservoir Dogs in for the millionth time, but then Ben graced the scene...I knew I had to at least watch his monologue.  It saved two things...first of all, the film itself and second it saved me the trouble of finding Reservoir Dogs and popping it in and changing to channel 3.....blah blah blah. Then in Ben's absence, the other actors FINALLY started to carry their own weight properly.  The character interaction between the Italians and the Jews was great. I laughed out loud and even committed a few lines to memory. But then the film slowed down again, and I pulled out my toenail clippers...the reaction my dog had to the sound of my toenails being trimmed became more entertaining then the film. Then Seth got caught, and he makes a deal with the feds (damn feds). Then he gets Chris to sign the sales slip and tells him. good!  It's picking up, I thought.  Then the buses and federal van pulled up.  I was all like, cool, we'll see some great court scenes... The End. ........ ........ The End? .......? .......? o...kay. If there was ever an ending that ever left more questions unanswered then there were plot twists and character development in the whole movie...this is it. What happened to Seth?  His dad?

There are reasons to pity him, but it doesn't turn into empathy and rooting for him because (a) he lacks a moral compass and (b) he is mostly pushed around by other characters rather than taking the lead.The transition from rookie to pro isn't very interesting, mostly playing out stereotypes about hard sales.

Not anymore, is what we end up seeing here.Also, you can't stop comparing it a bit to Wallstreet, and there's even a scene where cynically we see the characters playing to see which one of them knows the dialogues from Wallstreet the better. And there is Giovanni Ribbisi who I think is the future Nicolas Cage, sad face always playing thoughtful persons, but at the end he has always been able to provide a wonderful performance very intensively.

When his father, Judge Davis (Ron Rifkin,) finds out, Seth gets another job&#133;as a stockbroker. Basically, Seth just wants to make money to impress his father. My guys is to why the film was given an R rating was because of a few disturbing scenes. One scene, at the beginning of the film, where my favorite actor Jamie Kennedy, is doing cocaine. And another scene where Richi (Scott Caan) takes a guy outside, and beets him up. I guess I find Caan's character beating somebody up in this movie disturbing because it looks so real. I mean, my favorite genre is horror, which is a blood-filled-genre, but this looked so real, I was about to hide my face like a 5-year-old. The reason I gave this film a 9/10 was because of the ending. You feel cheated. I don't know if they purposely did it, or what, but I can't get into much detail about that unless I have to spoil it. So, it was a good movie for a certain kind of person.

He runs into some friends who tell him about a job as a stockbroker, where he could really start to make big money.  His portrayal of an inexperienced but eager young broker is made even better by his odd and extremely pale appearance, especially when he really begins to suspect something fraudulent in the firm that he is working for.There are numerous messages in the film, one of the most prevalent of which comes from the subplot involving Seth's (Ribisi) family, and particularly his father, Marty. He and Marty have a terrible relationship, probably stemming from Marty's history of emotional absence. Are you watching, all you fathers out there? Slap your kid across the face if he breaks his leg when he's young, and you may end up with the FBI after you when he grows up. As the old saying goes, bad parents have bad kids.(spoilers) However, the thing that Boiler Room tries to say is that this saying is not written in stone. Seth did not have an easy life, and he got into a lot of trouble, but in the end he looked at what was going on and he really tried to do the right thing, as Spike Lee would say. Sure, he rolled over on all of his stockbroker buddies, but these were the bad guys, and they were the ones who got him into the whole troublesome deal in the first place.This movie is not about making friends, it's about getting out of something that you know is wrong, especially if you know that what you are doing is really hurting people and damaging their lives for your own gain. This, by the way, is the other significant thing that this movie seems to be trying to say. With many things in life, especially if they entail immediate and tremendous financial gain, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.The acting was also excellent from everyone involved. Giovanni Ribisi delivered a great performance (which only faltered a little bit in the scene where he begs his father for help in his office). Ben Affleck was startlingly convincing as the big boss at the fraudulent firm, and something should be said of the fact that while coming off as amazingly intimidating, he managed to be a bit amusing at the same time (`I have a ridiculous house&#133;people who say money can't buy happiness don't have any&#133;look at my smile. Ear to ear, baby.').  Way to go, Ben. Vin Diesel comes from an excellent although indistinguishable role as the voice of the Iron Giant, to one of the senior brokers at the firm in Boiler Room, in his last role before his hideous starring performance in the ridiculous Pitch Black. He was doing so well, too.  Boiler Room is a very well made film. It is very talky, but it is not boring, and despite many hints that it is about to happen, the film never relies on gratuitous nudity to keep the audience's attention. It has a good story that is combined with an excellent cast and good direction to provide a surprisingly good thriller for unsuspecting audiences.

And I must say, I was really let down.Giovanni Ribisi is Seth Davis, straight out of college and running his own casino at home. Then one day, two stock brokers from a firm not-quite-famous with the general public (frankly, no one's heard of it) show up, and offer him to come in for an interview. Seth accepts, and is soon a member. Things start to look up then. His father (Ron Rifkin) begins to respect him again, after many years of spite between the two of them. He begins to form a relationship with Abby (Nia Long), the head secretary. And he's moving on to becoming a senior member. Yet, all of this is too good to be true, and Seth soon realizes that the firm he belongs to isn't all it's cracked up to be, and he must decide what to do next, as his business is on the line. Meanwhile, the FBI is suspicious, and is monitoring him, trying to work through Abby and even Seth's own father, putting love and trust on the line, all boiling (sorry) down to a final decision.Not that great of a movie. Nothing shady seems to become apparent until at least an hour in, and when the truth is revealed, it's none-too-shocking. This is one of those movies that falls into the new generation of hip, with young casts and everything the everyday MTV fan will like. Though I am of that target audience, I didn't find this all too appealing. The acting is weak, for the most part. Giovanni Ribisi acts as if he's drugged, and reads off his lines in an all-too-present slur. Vin Diesel was really starting to get on my nerves, why, I don't know. Nicky Katt was alright, nothing to rant or rave about. Every time Jaime Kennedy showed up, I expected him to start explaining to the other characters how to survive a scary movie. Needless to say, he was none to appealing. Ben Affleck in a very small role was so-so, a little over the top. The only performances I actually liked were from Nia Long and Ron Rifkin. They actually brought some maturity to a cast that resembled more of a frat house than a brokerage firm. Another point of note, and I rarely notice this in a film, was the overwhelming vulgarity. I'm not one to be against the use of expletives, but this movie went too far. Ben Affleck--who only showed up in two or three rather-lengthy scenes--was really getting to be too much with every other word being f***, or some variation of the word. That sort of put a damper on the film, as well as the annoying rap soundtrack, which really just made the whole thing feel like another one of those The Substitute movies. In any event, this is really a disappointment. The weak storyline, the predominantly unappealing cast, excessive vulgarity, and unfitting music all add up to make one terrible movie.

First of all, Ben Younger is an excellent director and especially writer, the script was fantastic. I look forward to seeing more from him. Second, the acting was superb. Giovanni Ribisi was excellent as Seth. You could really see the character growing and learning over the course of the movie. The rest of the cast turn in great performances as well, especially Vin Diesel as Chris, Ron Rifkin as Seth's father, and Ben Affleck as Jim, the super-motivator guy who promises all the new brokers millions of dollars.The relationship between Seth and his father is very well developed. Younger wants you to think that he's a horrible, uncaring father, but in the end we see that he really does love Seth. One scene impaticular that sticks out is a scene in his dad's office where Seth breaks down and cries, saying that all he ever wanted to do was make him proud. This scene was brilliantly acted by both Ribisi and Rifkin, and it was very well written.I have only 2 things that I would like to see changed. First, the ending was a little disappointing. I would've liked to see the raid and find out exactly what happened to the characters. Many of the character were very well developed and very important to the story, and it would've been nice to know their fate. Second, the soundtrack did not seem to fit too well. Maybe it's just a personal taste, but I didn't think the hip-hop soundtrack fit the mood of the movie too well.But these are just minor issues, and don't really detract all that much from the film.

Young man (Giovanni Ribisi) has overbearing father. Young man is caught running illegal casino games at college and gets recruited into super-elite stockbrokage firm (oooooh, how ominous!).

Then young man learns it's all very illict and begins to suffer a major fall from grace.Got all that? The same secret brotherhoods at work in Wall Street, Fight Club, and many other cheapo knockoffs is the moving force here, with enough testosterone to feed a boatload of five-star generals. Don't get me wrong, there's a place for these kinds of movies; it's just not on my TV screen.

It's not a pleasant film in any regard. Ribisi is very good in the lead, with just the right amount of wide-eyed optimism you'd expect from someone entering the brokerage industry, but nearly everyone around him is a laughable caricacture.

IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM, YOU MIGHT WANT TO WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE YOU READ THIS REVIEW.Wall Street is a hot topic on Main Street lately, so it is not surprising that this should become the topic of a film.  &#145;Boiler Room', however, is not really a Wall Street story but a grift story.  The term &#145;boiler room' is an expression con artists use for a phone scam operation.  This particular con just used stocks as the bait.  As a grift story, this was extremely well done.  The concept as presented in the film is ingenious.  It is a double blind scam where neither the brokers nor the patsies know there is a swindle going on.  The grifters hire naïve kids and teach them to be super high-pressure phone salesmen to push worthless stocks as bona fide investments.  They think they are real brokers selling hot stocks, when they are really just creating artificial demand, inflating the price of specific stocks so the grifters can sell their shares at a huge profit.  They then move on to another stock, and without the artificial boost, the price of the first stock plummets leaving the investors broke.We learn early in the film (in the trailer actually) that the FBI is investigating the operation and that they are planning a raid.  Therefore, the film is really more about the culture of the operation than its eventual fate.  We follow Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) through the training process to the point where he becomes a broker.  We see how the firm manipulates him through group acceptance, much the same way as religious cults control their members.This film has been compared to &#145;Glengarry Glen Ross' and &#145;Wall Street', with allusions to both within the film itself.  Of the two, it was more like GGR; only it was far more dynamic story.  First time writer/Director Ben Younger (who at 27 lives up to his name), has captured with a great deal of the frenetic world of telephone stock sales; the camaraderie and the adrenaline rush these brokers get when they close a deal.  The reason the film works is that there is an element of truth to the portrayal.  Legitimate brokers do make cold calls dangling stock tips to try to hook new clients.  After they get the clients though, the good ones advise their clients to diversify their portfolios rather than having them dump all their money into one hot stock.  The danger here is that the public will see a film like this and think that the type of corruption seen here is common, which is false.From a filmmaking standpoint, the cinematography was mundane, but the direction of the actors was excellent.  Younger was superb at creating the manic feeling of the office and the pumped up mentality of the brokers.  It seems he had a visceral sense of how this should look and how the characters should behave.The acting was tremendous, despite the young age of the cast.  This was a breakout performance for Giovanni Ribisi.  He was intense, confident and powerful in his portrayal of both the high flying broker and the wounded son.  Ben Affleck was awesome as the god of trainee motivation, intimidating and electrifying his eager young pups.  I thought he was far better than Alec Baldwin, who played essentially the same role in GGR.This was an excellent film.  It was a marvelous showcase for a lot of young talent, in both the acting and the directing.  I rated it an 8/10.  Unless liberal profanity offends you, it is definitely worth seeing.

Funny, nasty and cut-throat accurate with a fever pitch run thanks to its talented young assemblage of talent to burn; Affleck does a nice channelling of Alec Baldwin from 'Glengarry'.

He is constantly stuttering and drooling and acting like he's confused. But this is acceptable because his performance is on par with the rest of the movie.  These guys are filthy filthy rich, we get it. You don't need to keep beating it into our heads that they have tons of money. And the backstory about the relationship between Ribisi and his father? Who cares? It's poorly developed along with the rest of the plot. If you want a good movie that brings interest to an uninteresting subject, get Wall Street or Glengarry Glen Ross. Boiler Room is a poor second.

The screenplay is original - But the themes and plot aren't and it's impossible not to be reminded of a certain movie from the 1980s that starred Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen and was directed by Oliver Stone . I think you know the one I'm talking about Middle class entrepreneur Seth Davis wants to get ahead in life and under pressure from his family picks stockbroking as his career path . Uberstockbroker Jim Young takes Seth under his wing and shows him that if you want to be successful in life you have to abandon scruples and morality because only the cruel and heartless will survive . The world is a beautiful ocean but it's only sharks that are well fed You've seen this plot before haven't you where the main protagonist abandons his humanity in order to live the capitalist dream , realises what a cruel person he is and tries to redeem himself , and if you've seen this plot before you instantly know 15 minutes into the movie where the plot twists are going to happen and how everything is going to end which makes for a painfully predictable story . I will praise the acting of Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel who probably give career best performances but the subtext wallops the audience over the head every ten seconds as to what a terrible thing free market economics is . Thanks but I had worked that out for myself ;ong before I saw that 1987 movie by Oliver Stone "}]
