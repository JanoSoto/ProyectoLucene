[{"Title":"Smart black comedy with Ben Stiller's best performance to date.","Date":"21 August 2002","Score":"18 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I think Ben Stiller is one of the most talented comic actors currently working, even though he is often in awful movies (e.g. 'Zoolander', 'The Suburbans'). 'Permanent Midnight' is one of the best movies he has been involved with and features what is arguably his single finest performance. Based on the autobiography of TV hack writer Jerry Stahl, this is a smart, fresh and blackly humorous look at addiction and Hollywood. Stiller has a fine supporting cast here, especially his buddies and frequent co-stars Owen Wilson ('Bottle Rocket') and Janeane Garofolo ('Reality Bites'), the amazingly charismatic star-in-the-making Peter Greene ('Laws Of Gravity'), and comedy veteran Fred Willard ('Best In Show'), who all have small but memorable roles. Hell, even Liz Hurley and Cheryl Ladd are good in this, believe it or not. 'Permanent Midnight' was, like so many other good movies that don't pander to a mass audience, a box office flop, but will hopefully find a larger audience in years to come via video and DVD. I think it is one of the most underrated movies of the last ten years, and highly recommend it.

It was simply too easy to pass up. And sometimes writers fall back on easy cliches, especially in headlines.Actually, make that especially in headlines and in movies about substance abuse. Simply put, Permanent Midnight fails. And it doesn't fail because of the direction, or the writing, or the performances (thought there are certainly serious flaws with each), but because it doesn't have anything new to the discussion. Permanent Midnight on one hand is about the depths to which drugs can drive a man, but it's also about the superficiality of Hollywood. The problem is that neither angle has anything remotely original in it and so barring something remarkable in the execution, there's really no point in making the movie. Permanent Midnight, though, features many good things, but nothing remarkable enough to justify the been there/ done that feeling that remains when the narrative is finished.Permanent Midnight features a framing story that feels made up. Since I haven't read Jerry Stahl's book of the same name, I cannot speak to the truth of the framing sequences which feature Maria Bello as an ex-drug addict named Kitty. I can only say how painfully convenient it is for recovering Jerry (Ben Stiller) to have this blond angel more than willing to hear his story of degradation. Not a moment between Jerry and Kitty rings true emotionally, but at least it gives writer/director David Veloz and entre into the story, not that the story actually goes anywhere. You see, when Jerry arrives in LA he's already a junkie, living with his friend Nickie (Owen Wilson), who's also already a junkie. He marries a British TV producer so that she can get her green card and she helps him get a television writing job. As shown in the film, there's nothing about his life that leads the the progression of his drug addiction. He just gets deeper and deeper and befriends shadier and shadier characters.There's an arbitrary point at which he obviously decided to quit (since he's clean in the frame story), but by the time we get there, it seems so obvious and so unsatisfying as to make the journey feel wasted. No matter how bad things seems to get, the audience knows it could always be worse, because we've seen worse drug addictions in a dozen movies of varying qualities. Throughout the flashback, Jerry makes no real attempts at recovery and yet only falls to a certain level. He never makes it to hell. Nothing in the film has a payoff.Much of the problem, then, is in Veloz's episodic screenplay. Characters wander in and out and nothing really comes together. Jerry seems strung-out, but he never seems horrible, so we can't really pity the people who trust him and love him because he doesn't really do any serious damage to them. Everything just comes and goes. The film is filled with tiny star cameos which meet with only occasional success. Owen Wilson and Janeane Garofalo are always good to have around, as is the perpetually psychotic Peter Greene. Cheryl Ladd, Fred Willard, Andy Dick, and Connie Nielsen, though, provide uninteresting one shot encounters.Veloz perhaps wisely avoids drug movie hallucination clich√©s. Aware that he lacks the visual sensibility to rival Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Trainspotting, he restricts his flourishes to a single drug nightmare and to boring New Wave-y jump cuts and the like. Veloz clearly sets the film up as Ben Stiller's show.As Jerry Stahl, Stiller is never less than solid. He makes it clear why people would continue to trust Jerry even with all of his problems. The script, however, gives no indication of the genius that everybody attributed to Stahl, making it difficult to feel that the character is wasting his talent. Stiller, then, is fleetingly amusing, fleetingly harrowing, and always acting. When the character, in a moment of true desperation turns to his neck for an uncollapsed vein, it's Ben Stiller shooting up into his neck, not the character. It's tough to watch, but you feel for an actor on the edge, rather than a character. So people in Hollywood are so self-absorbed that they don't notice what's going on around them. OK. I've seen that before.  And amidst all that egomania, people with problems are allowed to fall through the cracks. And I've seen that before. And recovery is possible? In a one-day-at-a-time way? I've seen that before as well. I kept waiting for Permanent Midnight to offer me something new and different. But it was only more of the same. There's enough good there for a 5/10.

Been there and back myself, so to tell you the truth, nothing I saw in the movie made me wince, although there was a lot to relate to. There's a scene where - this really isn't a spoiler, given the context of the movie - where Jerry dumps some pills out of a prescription bottle, and they look exactly like the kind of pills they're supposed to be. Nice attention to detail. One thing that movies never quite get right or, perhaps like this one, simply choose to ignore, are the details of how one actually turns one's life around from being addicted to recovering, and this movie was no exception. We know in the beginning that Jerry has been through rehab, but that process itself, which may I say ain't exactly a cakewalk - and I mean you have to be clean before you can go through it, remains rather mysterious. Oh well, whatever, an interesting, entertaining movie that held my interest for its running time. Some usage scenes might be a bit upsetting to the non-anointed, although probably nothing quite so hard to take as in Requiem For A Dream.

Jerry then hits bottom, recovers, and writes his autobiography. Permanent Midnight chronicles Jerry's fall from Hollywood hotshot to junkie bum. Besides such an unpleasant subject, and an equally unsympathetic main character, Permanent Midnight still entertains, in a morbid sort of way. It's told in flashback (at the beginning of the movie Jerry's just finished rehab and is about to return to his old LA haunts), so we kind of know where the movie will take us. There's no mystery, we're going to watch Jerry's self-destructive crash and burn in close-up. We're a little in the dark about what will happen after the movie catches up with itself, but there's really not a lot of tension. It's like watching a car wreck in very slow motion.Ben Stiller does an excellent job portraying Jerry, with his craving for the drug rising above, and then destroying, all that's good in his life. It's quite a frightening portrayal. Elizabeth Hurley, as his girlfriend, is a bit of a stretch for both her acting talent and in the casting. But the rest of the cast does fine work. I think the major detriment to this movie is that the audience knows beforehand how it will all end. This is a very dramatic subject, but with no drama in the screenplay. And that is a drag.

Stiller's performance was excellent and really showed me the flipside of what could happen to somebody when they get hooked on drugs. The whole cast from Maria Bello to Elizabeth Hurley were solid support for the main character, Jerry Stahl. The real Jerry Stahl actually had a role, which surprised me, as Dr. Murphy from the drug rehabilitation clinic. Stahl recounts his life from a hotel room while having a sexual encounter he met while he was working at a restaurant drive-thru. The way that the director lays out the film is perfect; it is different than what I have seen before. The way Jerry Stahl recounts his life the way he did pleasantly surprised me. I warn anyone who wants to watch Permanent Midnight to brace themselves for extreme drug use by sticking needles in arms and sensual love scenes. I recommend this film for its stars' performances.

It's the story of a drug- addicted real-life semi-celebrity, it's directed with slick style and a fast pace, and it provokes emotion with its increasingly gloomy atmosphere and R-rated subject matter. The but or the however is hard to place, because there is no real reason why it can't live up to the expectations based on what I just described. The only real way to say why it isn't the contemporary classic or young moviegoer's classic that it should be is to say that it doesn't have as much intensity that one would expect from it. It allows itself to indulge in the formula elements of a movie like this.There are formula elements to every genre and subgenre, even the fast-paced stylized biopic and the drug film, even though they don't seem like they would. Why would they? They're usually based on true stories and real lives, or they go in directions most other films don't take. Still, a real life and a true story can still either turn out the way so many similar ones do, or their adaptations do. Permanent Midnight is a formula film of its subgenre.That doesn't stop it from being enjoyable and powerful on a substantial level. It's directed well and Stiller's performance is fantastic. It's loaded with dark humor, Scorsesian music placement and jump cuts disguised as techno music and fade outs, and attention-grabbing supporting players like Owen Wilson and Maria Bello. If only its storytelling took another avenue, or if only it were tighter and more extensive.

Jerry Stahl is played by Ben Stiller in his most challenging yet most convincing role to date. It's a real privilege to watch such a performance.Mind you, I'm not exactly Ben Stiller's biggest fan (to be fair, I have enjoyed a few of his films), and Jerry Stahl was the writer of the TV show ALF; while that could have been a turn-off for me, it wasn't. Sure, there have been some moralizing, vanilla critics who couldn't stomach the overabundance of drug abuse depicted, but I really think too many of them found it hard to rate the film objectively due to what they took as an affront to their precious sensitivities. Which is not to say this film didn't get its share of raving reviews. It's a black comedy, an incomprehensibly strange creature for some, but a true friend to others.If you're smarter than most people, and you can take your entertainment black, see this one.

This is a pretty poor depiction of heroin addiction and withdrawal.Right when he uses in the first scene, he appears to have the symptoms of using meth. He's anxious, he's looking around nervously, etc. Not once did he fall out of consciousness or nod off. These are the symptoms of methamphetamine usage. During another scene, his bedside companion uses a substance on a vein in her inner thigh and immediately starts going into an orgasm. Also, a symptom of a methamphetamine induced meth-gasm.During the scenes that he's using, he consistently goes into sweats and even one time at a party enters some kind of psychosis where he's hallucinating. Sweats occur during the withdrawal stage of addiction and hallucination does not ever occur unless mixed with another upper of some kind. Is he really using heroin? Until he starts using crack cocaine which can actually induce these symptoms that are depicted, each frame of mind that is displayed is the polar opposite of opiate-abuse.Heroin induces involuntary dreaming, even happening mid-conversation where a user will nod-off in the middle of it. The case of _not_ having opiates in your bloodstream will actually give you flu-like symptoms. Instead, this film depicts the flu-like symptoms occurring during the time of the main character's usage of the substance which is terribly inaccurate.Movies that depict opiate addiction and withdrawal accurately would be something such as BlackBird, Jesus' Son, or The Panic in Needle Park. This film unfortunately falls incredibly short of these other films in terms of accuracy. Other than these inaccuracies, the film is a fairly generic story of an addict losing control of his life. I probably wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.

Despite a good performance by Stiller, Permanent Midnight is a thin film.

Their conversations result in a number of Jerry's memories which are shown in flashback form.Whether this is a good movie depends on what one expects to get out of it. Permanent Midnight tries to be entertaining in spots. To wit, Jerry picks up a German girl, they have meaningless sex, and at climax she yells, My God, my God, I'm being f**ked by a Jew! Very marginal humor. This is not a very entertaining film, but it is gripping simply for the realization that some people actually try to navigate their lives that way. During this period, the real Jerry Stahl was writing for popular 1980s series like Moonlighting, Alph, and Northern Exposure. Anyway, during his addiction phase Stahl represents himself as a person with little self-control, lying, needing drugs to get through any stressful situation. Then, when he first tries to rehabilitate, bad friends drag him down.  I am glad I saw this film, however I cannot recommend it strongly. However, I now realize that thirty-something Maria Bello might be my new favorite female actress, after seeing her here, in Coyote Ugly and in Duets.

Stiller makes him a likeable person, because no matter what he does, we've been with him on this journey, and despite everything, he is still like a little boy who knows he will eventully be punished, but is having too much fun to stop.He also manages to avoid the opportunity that most actors sieze in over-acting just because they are an addict.

In his directorial debut, David Veloz, the writer of Natural Born Killers, appears to hesitate.  He tells a one sided, egocentric tale that revolves around Jerry Stahl.  Anyone who has lost a friend to drugs knows the pain an addict carelessly inflicts.

Unfortunately, the film is unevenly paced and rather humdrum.The film's pace is really off, because it tries to cram at least a year and a half's worth of events into 80 minutes.  The story is told in segments, meaning the film jumps around a lot; Jerry (Stiller) switches dealers and loses friends out of the blue, but more importantly, the entire period between when he is in rehab and when the film begins is alluded to but is noticeably absent (how and why DID he come to that fateful fast food job?).  The film focuses mainly on the beginning of Jerry's downfall due to addiction, but never tells the whole story (he never seems to hit addiction's true rock bottom).  The segway between these sequences - Jerry telling another ex-addict more of his story, should've been done away with; its totally unnecessary and serves only to lead to an ending that makes little sense, even within the context of the segways.Besides all the missing sequences leaving gaping and occasionally confusing holes in the story, the story left isn't terribly interesting.  The drugs cause successful man to become a desperate shadow of his former self plot is second only to the Hollywood doesn't give a damn about anyone subplot in its simplicity.  It's been done before, and if it hasn't, it sure seems like it has, including the telling the story to another sympathetic ex-addict aspect.  Perhaps including some of the aforementioned missing segments would have given the story the extra kick it needed.The story is the only problem with the film, the performances are excellent.  Stiller is just as good in a dramatic role (although, somewhat ironically, his character is a quirky Jewish addict), and Elizabeth Hurley gives an excellent supporting performance as Jerry's marriage-of-convenience-wife who actually cares about him, but gets the fall-back from his addiction instead (her response to these incidents is only hinted at, and should have been extended on).  Janeane Garofalo is another great supporting character (Jerry's agent) that deserved more screen time.  Besides sporting great performances, there are a few inspired scenes, though due to the story's disjointed order, they feel just as dropped in as the rest of the story's major developments.There's nothing outright wrong with the film, it's just missing too much.  If the film had run for the length of a regular film it probably would've filled in enough of the holes that it'd work better.

David Veloz shows off deft knowingness in his economicly dense script & directorial choices.Maria Bello is a revelation as an impromptu motel bedmate, a twinkle-eyed ex-junkie angel of a tourguide in Stahl's desert of recovery. Elizabeth Hurley displays subtle complexities as the sleek industry Brit who marries Jerry for a green card while attempting to wrangle Stahl's fierce oscillations during the worst of his slide downward. Liz Torres, playing the Boyle Heights surrogate mom (and stalwart resource) to what her adoptive/addicted son, Jerry needs most, is seen far too seldom (in any medium). And just when you haven't had enough, along comes Janeane Garofalo hittin' all the marks of the new breed literary agent, at once attracted and repelled by Stahl's battered talents. The kicker is the 80's comeback television star, determined to reel in Jerry for a much needed resuscitation to her wheezing No Such Luck series, as impeccably embodied by Cheryl Ladd.All this for a fraction of what it cost Albert Brooks's paunchy Brentwood screenscribe to keep Sharon Stone in baubles, health food & dry cleanable silks in the best suite at the Four Seasons in THE MUSE.Pick your poison.

For instance, Veloz fails to capture Stahl's wit and sense of humor, the cop DID NOT arrest Stahl when he pulled him over (Cop where you're at right now is worse than any place I can put you), the fact that Stahl wrote for Moonlighting, Playboy, his interview with director David Lynch for the chance to write for Twin Peaks, etc, etc, etc,.

The DVD Director's commentary indicates that he had specifically cast Wilson on the basis of his 'Bottle Rocket' performance, but then he seems to have had the better part of his performance cut. The DVD shows several extra schemes which include him and Stiller - all of which are great and really add to the story...in fact, without them, you get no feeling for their differing approach to the taking of drugs, how their friendship crashed and burned, nor how this further isolated the Stiller character. I particularly liked the (deleted) schemes where they bumbled into the party set up to be met by Elizabeth Hurley at her most glacial - acting like a couple of scolded kids- and the later one where Stiller is thrown out of Wilson's house for hitting on his girlfriend whilst under the influence.

The trailer also sort of implied this. While Permanent Midnight has its funny moments, it's basically a drama.While this is based on the true story of TV writer Jerry Stahl, it fictionalized a bit. The shows Jerry works on in the movie are stand-ins for the ones he worked on in real life, for instance. Probably to avoid licensing issues.This was David Veloz's first (and to date, only) directorial job and it shows. It's not the direction is bad, but it's certainly nothing special and there are a few places where it's a little hard to follow.This doesn't drag the movie too far down though as it rests largely on the actors, specifically Ben Stiller, who shows any naysayers here that he can do drama. He does a great job portraying someone who's a likable guy with a pretty decent life who just keeps using more and more drugs until he starts freaking out in public, shooting up into his jugular and generally wrecking everything and losing whatever self-respect he had.Despite the subject matter, Permanent Midnight avoids becoming too depressing through bits of humor, a short (88 min) running time and an optimistic perspective.I doubt this is the best movie for scaring your kids off drugs, but recommended for people who like stories about overcoming or are fans of Jerry Stahl or any of the actors.

It made me literally squirm in the reality of its many sequences of shooting up.  However, the point of a life spiralling down into new depths until the personal bottom is found which enables the hope of turning a life of self abuse around is made many times.  I would have preferred to have seen fewer scenes shooting up and more of the potentially healing relationship that followed.  By far his personal growth and challenge in learning to live without drugs would had much more depth and discovery than finding out how he got there in such tedious detail. The last love scene between the main characters conveyed a much more genuine feeling of connection and caring that comes from having lost in life, from forgiveness, from life experiences that hinted at the true potential of this movie and the heights of expression it could have achieved.Surely, it's a different screenplay, but is one that tells a whole story that is worthy of a feature-length film.

Permanent Midnight really tries to be as good as these, but it only ends up with about half the effect and resonance that Trainspotting and Basketball Diaries had.  Ben Stiller isn't bad at all.  In fact, it's the best work I have ever seen him do.  He's a believable addict and an obviously intelligent actor but he doesn't inspire or even shock you the way Leonardo DiCaprio and Ewan McGregor did.  Why?  Because the story is tired.  I realize that it sounds callous to say a drug-addict's story is overdone, but it is no matter how true the tale being told.  Along with that this story is far too one sided.  The only character we ever get to know is Stiller, everyone else appears to be an accessory to his lifestyle.  Therefore, actresses like Maria Bello and Elizabeth Hurley go to complete waste despite they're good performances.  I would guess that most of their roles ended up on the cutting room floor.  One actress does manage to put a little life into a nothing role though.  Janeane Garofalo's character is barely mentionable as far as the plot of the story goes, but her performance found depth in ten lines.

There are so many films like this, it should become a sub-genre.  PERMANENT MIDNIGHT is not a bad film, however, we have seen it in films like TRAINSPOTTING, BASKETBALL DIARIES, WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN, etc.  Whether it's drinking or hard-core drugs, the pictures are essentially the same, with varying degrees of success.  MIDNIGHT lies in the middle.  It is slick, graphic, and forgettable.Ben Stiller leaps into dramatic mode, and portrays real-life TV writer Jerry Stahl.  Stahl may have had talent, but he sure was unappealing.  Stiller looks the part of a paranoid drug addict, but there are never any moments where we can really embrace his character and care about his problems.  He's married to Elizabeth Hurley, in a staged relationship that turns real in the blink of an eye.  No development or chemistry whatsoever exists between Hurley and Stiller.  Why are they together?  It just doesn't gel in such an underwritten marriage.  She can only put up with his smack-shooting so long, and the inevitable happens.The drug usage is hard and heavy.  A scene where Stiller shoots up in front of his baby daughter in a car is pretty disturbing.  Another tricky scene has Ben and his crack buddy, inhaling, then jumping into the windows of a high-rise building, risking death if they go through.  The fly-by shot is done well.  The whole movie is shot and edited in whatever frenetic state the main character is in.  Heroin scenes are slow and more hallucinogenic. Crack scenes are dizzying.  Again, you've probably seen this all before.  If going on Maury is the thing Stahl regrets the most about going straight, I guess he learned his lesson.
