That accent!!I'd definitely recommend it if you just want to kick back, relax. Watch some big 80s hair and funny girl band stuff. The other cast members are pretty cool too although not as memorable.

I thought she was so cool, and I copied a lot of my fashion styles after her character in the movie (big hair and all). Being a child of the '80s I've been slowly collecting many of the classic comedies, and this one has been on my list for a while. So when I discovered last month that it was finally coming out on DVD and at a great price, I pre-ordered my copy. It has some really good moments and good one-liners, like when Julia Roberts' character, Daryle is told by one of the preppy guys she's seeing You're different from the other girls, she responds I can work really hard to be the same, or when Daryle is explaining to Billy that getting married is a natural thing, Billy responds Dying is natural too, but you don't see people rushing to do that. So if you want to take a trip back to the '80s or if you're a Julia Roberts fan, this movie is for you.

Four girls and a token guy, a geeky one at that, travel to a beach coast roadhouse to be the summer house band. When the owner takes a liking to them, they could be headed for Europe where his friend can set the girls up. Are you kidding me? These girls don't sound good enough for that kind of opportunity. The girl band is headed by Family Ties girl Justine Bateman on lead vocals; Britta Phillips is on lead guitar; Julia Roberts is on bass; Trini Alvarado is on drums. They all seem to have been cast with big hair in mind, popular in the late 80's. Scott Coffey is the token male on keyboards. The girls are all different clich√©d types Phillips is the simpleton stoner with an over-abundance of brainless comments; Roberts is the slut girl supposedly; Alvarado is the tough girl that falls for geeky Coffey! Of course that would never happen in real life. Bateman's character isn't fleshed out enough for us to know how to identify with her. She comes off as street savvy, but then melts into Liam Neeson's arms. He plays the club owner where the girls stay for the summer, and he is far too old for someone of Bateman's ilk, as portrayed in this movie. I didn't really believe he was ever that interested in her. The subplot about the guy gang is ludicrous and serves no purpose. The 80's synthesizer bridging music is annoying at times. Deborah Harry, of Blondie fame, has a cameo as sort of an acquaintance of Neeson's. The film has a couple of funny moments, but is mostly forgettable. Watch it only if you have nothing better to do, like washing your big hair. * of 4 stars.

We get no information about their musical backgrounds, and their idea of jamming is to feign a version of Iko Iko while driving in their stolen van (I say 'feign' because the sound of their unison vocals is distinctly studio-enhanced). There's one guy in the otherwise all-girl band, and they make him sleep behind a sheet--out of modesty?--and yet the girls themselves are sexually active and think nothing of having sex in that van until the damn thing just about topples over. The movie wants to have it both ways be a modern look at streetwise teens and yet also be an old-fashioned musical. Justine Bateman works hard in the leading role, but she seems to suffocate under the plastic handling; newcomer Julia Roberts shows off a nice sense of sarcastic humor, but the movie is an underachiever, with oldies-rock tunes given '80s makeovers that wouldn't pass muster on Star Search. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Pretty good","Date":"12 January 2014","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":" I do not understand the low ratings by IMDb reviewers and the critics.

I can buy them performing the titular Stones number, and C'mon Everybody is virtually impossible to ruin, but the cowbell-driven take on Knock on Wood is awful and the reggae-rific version of Mr. Big Stuff is a joke (and that joke just isn't funny anymore).

Although Times Square fans (the film from which Satisfaction steals the most) will frequently cringe during the viewing experience, the fusion of these three films is not a totally bad idea. It did give Trini Alvarado, eight years later, a chance to play the tough girl Nicky Marotta part, the character she played against in Times Square. Although she plays her less like Robin Johnson did and more like Tara Reid's Cybil in Girl (1998). An underrated actress, Alvarado carries too much baggage (nice girl type-casting and too sweet a face) into this role to even begin to sell it. A much better idea that might have saved the film would have been for her and co-star Justin Bateman to switch parts. Bateman is capable of looking mean and is really too limited as an actress for a part with the degree of dimensionality of Jennie Lee. I've never quite grasped the popularity of Julia Roberts but for her mega-fans Satisfaction is a must see. The script doesn't give her much to work with but it is an opportunity to see her when she was this young. Of course there is some retrospective perverse amusement to be had at the idea of Roberts and Liam Neeson playing second banana's to the talent challenged Bateman, Britta Phillips' career rocketed forward from this film with 65 episodes as the voice of the title character in Jem and the Holograms. Nice voice, excellent casting choice, and a cute performance; she and Chris Nash at least manage to give a fair amount of authenticity to the production. Director Joan Freeman of Streetwalkin' (1985) fame has never done another feature; after these casting decisions it is not hard to figure out why. Maybe she is just another innocent victim of an Aaron Spelling production, she clearly was not a budding Allan Moyle. Likewise Screenwriter Charles Purpura; although his script is no worse than a lot of stuff currently getting feature treatment and the outdated slang no doubt sounded less lame in 1988. Although full of terrible music (covers of classic rock tunes performed slightly worse than when arranged for your high school band's halftime show) the film did connect with its primary target audience, discontented teenage girls who were not so disillusioned that they could not still get off on an identification jag with a group of squeaky clean girl rockers. Those looking for a more real growing up is painful  experience should stick with Times Square and the more recent Pretty Persuasion. Then again, what do I know?

They just hop in a van and go.We have what could fall into a beach blanket movie with singing,gaiety, an attempted suicide and a romance between Justine Bateman and Liam Neeson, a widowed song writer who shall we say has a lot on his mind.Of course, Neeson likes the band so much that he wants them to defer school and go rock in Europe.I added the extra 1/2 star since the film did end correctly, that is, that school comes first. Unfortunately, this film comes in last.

Thanks to the simple script by Charles Purpura and to the sensitive direction of Joan Freeman the little story works well.The interesting aspect of the film is the cast. The band consists of leader Justine Bateman with Trini Alvarado, Britta Phillips, Scott Coffey as the token male, Deborah Harry and yes, the movie debut of Julia Roberts! Liam Neeson serves as the love interest for Justine Bateman's character and Michael DeLorenzo has a small part, too. The music is fun and the cast commits to the idea of the film well. Strange to see a film from 1988 with the established stars disappearing and the 'newcomers' taking flight.

Fox's successful jump from Family Ties to the big screen made Justine Bateman a marketable commodity as well in this small and really totally unimpressive quick-flick. Bateman is the head of a small rock band that gets a gig in a bar in California and naturally Bateman falls in love with a then-unknown Liam Neeson. The typical things occur as this is little more than another long music video from the 1980s. Julia Roberts is also along for the ride as one of the girls in Bateman's band. Watching Neeson and Roberts in this mess is really interesting, but they were not stars yet and in the end Satisfaction cannot boost past the dreaded bomb status. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).

I first discovered my, now ratty looking, copy on the rental shelves of my parents convenience store when I was 13, and I still love it to this day. Perhaps my opinion is a bit biased, because I basically own every 80's teen buddy movie (I had a huge black and white Breakfast Club poster hanging in my dorm room this year, and received quite a bit of teasing for it). Maybe my dated tastes don't belong in this ultra modern world, but how could anyone not love these types of movies?  Trini Alvadrado's and Britta Phillip's performances really impressed me, Scott Coffey was just plain adorable, Liam Neeson was a great casting choice (very dry and sarcastic in his opening scenes, he really should keep making comedies), and personally, I found Julia Roberts far more amusing in this film than anything else she's famous for! Justine Bateman's acting was a bit melodramatic at times, but it's an otherwise small flaw in this hidden gem. I used to perform quite a bit growing up, and no other movie has allowed me to indulge in my adolescent rock and roll fantasies quite like this one.

They're young. They're good, in a mediocre film about a girl band and the trials and tribulations within it. Would I have watched this film without Liam and Julia? No. And neither will you if you don't have an interest in these two fine actors. The movie itself is so-so bordering on bad, but still- I couldn't help watching because of the pre-star stars.

It features the Eighties' bad taste, bad ass Justine Bateman, the rest of Julia Roberts and horrible classic rock songs. I'm told I have to make this review 10 lines long so I'm going to write a bunch of words now. But I've already said what had to be said about this swell movie. It's fine. The reviewers who badmouthed it simply have messed up and hurtful priorities. That's got to be 10 lines. But I'm told it isn't. So I'm still writing words. How much do you really need to know about what people think about a movie? It's not that big of a commitment just to watch it and make up your own mind, for crying out loud. This has got to be 10 lines. Oh, thank god!

This why we all love this movie. Having Tina Yothers play Kramer from Kramer vs. Kramer was brilliant. Some people don't like Eddie Murphy, but you have to admit he's talented after watching this movie. Some people argue that having a bulemic as your lead is bad because their acting is always sarcastic and vain, I disagree. Watch this movie while very high and you might actually have a chat with Jesus. We need more movies like this because the social commentary is in tune with God. This is a 4 star movie and shows why people from t.v. shows should be huge stars. This movie is basically an enema for the soul. Have fun people and remember to always rock & roll.

Wonder what ever became of Julia Roberts?The plot was lousy, and most of the acting was amateurish.  But because of Justine Bateman's smile, I gave two more stars than I would otherwise, 6/10. "}]
