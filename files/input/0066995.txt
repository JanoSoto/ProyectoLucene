[{"Title":"Oh, providing the collars and cuffs match...","Date":"26 July 2001","Score":"82 out of 123 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  Diamonds Are Forever is often described as a Roger Moore film starring Sean Connery, but it goes even farther than that. Whereas Moore ushered in ironic/silly codings, Diamonds contains the most overtly camp humour the series ever indulged in. The film also contains the most amount of nudity, and arguably the rudest jokes of the franchise. The title quote is Connery's quip to a girl with ever-changing wigs, while later we get the immortal I'm afraid you've caught me with more than my hands up.There's the sense of the odd, or uneasy, about this one all the way through. From the theme title (and what a great song!) precipitated by a cat's cry to the homosexual henchmen Mr.Wynt and Mr. Kidd. Their unnerving air is not the result of their gay, slightly homophobic, portrayal, but in Putter Smith's performance as Kidd. Not a trained actor, but an accomplished jazz bassist, this off-kilter playing creates an unconscious, unsettling atmosphere.It's this juxtaposition which compels throughout. Like seeing Britain's top espionage agent doing the childhood snogging with yourself routine then smashing a man's head through a window just seconds later. It's a superficially lightweight film, but with a nasty, almost bitter undercurrent. Connery's obvious resistance to the role actually serves it well here, given that this is the first post-wife Bond movie. Bernard Lee plays an unusually terse M to complement this abrasive 007. Such a starch display cuts through the smug underpinnings of the character and makes the cheesy one-liners more palatable. He looks older than in any of his other Bond films - Never Say Never Again included &#150; but this also fits his anguished, bereaved state. In line with this most misogynistic of Bond pictures, Jill St. John's character development passes from intelligent, through to devious and down into simpering bimbo.Incidental music is a bit disattached, and often feels like it belongs to another film. It works against, rather than with, the picture it's there to support. Yet although not quite the best of the series, this and the following Live and Let Die are the most distinctive in look, feel and style. They're light, pacy, poppish takes on the format, full of comicbook verve and wit. Guy Hamilton's direction is also very good; making the most of the LA location with use of expansive aerial shots.The plot seems fairly complex, though maybe that's because it's underdeveloped and submerged beneath slightly irrelevant setpieces. I had to smile at the line Get him off that machine, that isn't a toy as Sean boards the moonbuggy. I remember after the film it became one, a primary-coloured Dinky version with a spinning radar. Brings back memories, that.Blofeld, who has now taken up cloning and cross-dressing, is played here by Charles Gray. Although at the time it was four years before he would become the criminologist in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the two are now inseparable, in my mind at least. As if this wasn't enough high camp to go round, there's also Connery being demolished by Bambi and Thumper, a couple of sadistic female gymnasts.If something about this quirky, offbeat Bond (and some sources list it as the seventh least successful in terms of gross) doesn't quite gel, then it greatly improves on repeat viewings.

There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER rates on a scale of 1 to 10 Title DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER A slight perversion of the once popular ad line used to sell wedding rings, this title suggests romance, but certainly that is the last thing on the film's agenda. It's a wonderfully deceptive title. 10 points.Pre-Credit Teaser Bond kills Blofeld, which supposedly seems to tie up major loose ends from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. But considering that when last we saw him, Blofeld was murdering James' new bride, such a confrontation should have immense power. An important turning point in the series slips past with no acknowledgment. Though the opening does serve to show that Sean Connery is back and George Lazenby has been released from Bondage. 2 points.Opening Credits Maurice Binder's style of opening montage is wearing just a tad old and predictable. Pretty enough with its diamond-studded theme for 4 points, but not good enough to do justice to the Theme Song It is said that originally the film was to be a followup to GOLDFINGER, with his brother taking up where Goldfinger left off. That never came off, but certainly Diamonds are Forever is a perfect companion piece to the earlier theme song. It, of course, has the fabulous Shirley Bassey doing the vocals again, but it also repeats the cynicism of applying sensuous lust to material wealth. It's an anti-love song, much like Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend, only it doesn't hide its hard-edged avarice under a bouncy tune. It is, I think, even better than Goldfinger, and may be the prefect James Bond song amoral, stylish and seductive. 10 points Bond, James Bond Connery is back, a bit chunkier and a tad grayer, but apparently his extended vacation from the role of 007 paid off. Personally, I think this is his best Bond work as Sean strolls through the film with relaxed charm and a complete understanding that this film, if not the entire series, is a comedy. Bond purists tend to disregard DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER because of its flip attitude, but that is what makes it my favorite. 10 points.Bond Babes Lana Wood, Natalie's sister, is on hand as the mandatory eye candy, and is all-too-disposable as Plenty O'Toole. But someone had the bright idea of making the main Bond Girl someone with a flair for comedy. Enter maturing starlet Jill St. John, the epitome of 1960's cheesy, Playboy sexuality. Whatever her limitations as an actress, St. John certainly had the knack for using her sexuality as an amusing toy and still maintain the edge that she is a lot smarter than she looks. As Tiffany Case, her intelligence seems to diminish as the film wears on (it seems the women Bond beds all end up dead or dumb), but her ability to fill a bikini remains indisputable. 9 points.Bond Villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld is back again, though only his love of fluffy, white pussycats remains constant. The intense geek of Donald Peasence and the uncouth thug of Telly Savalas are replaced by Charles Gray, who opts to play the part with droll, bemused wit and -- radically -- a full head of hair. Gray never gained iconic stature as Blofeld (that would come later as the Blofeld-like narrator in THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW), but for my money he is the best Blofeld, a villain of classy arrogance who is singularly unimpressed by Bond. 10 points.Bond Baddies Ah yes, Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint; as played by Putter Smith and Bruce Glover, they are the Chip and Dale of Bond assassins; two more gracious and well-mannered killers would be hard to find. The film has been accused of homophobia for including a pair of gay killers, but considering the sheer number of assassins to cross Bond's path, it would be more discriminatory to exclude them based on their orientation. Wint and Kidd are at once gay clich√©s and yet surprisingly non-stereotypical. Nonetheless, they glide (prance? skip?) through the film with cold-blooded assurance and a rather endearing affection. And if they aren't butch enough, there's always Bambi and Thumper (Lola Larson and Trina Parks) on hand to beat the tar out of James. 9 points.Plot Blofeld hopes to corner the diamond market to use them on some sort of outer space laser with which he can -- again -- hold the nations of the world for ransom. Doesn't this guy ever learn? They even do the you've killed James Bond bit again. 5 points.Production values Bond's globetrotting brings him to the glitz and pseudo-grandeur of Las Vegas in all of its tacky glory. It makes for a nicely surrealistic backdrop, appropriate for the film's self-mocking attitude -- though a major chase scene is marred by the large number of tourists standing along the route, watching the filming. 7 points.Bonus Points The Bond producers' love of unorthodox casting pays off with the selection of country singer and sausage maker Jimmy Dean as the reclusive millionaire based on Howard Hughes. It is such a bizarre choice, yet Dean's country boy charm is a wonderful contrast to both Hughes' nutty behavior and to the bemused sophistication of Bond. 5 points.Summary DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is a turning point in the series; the gritty, pseudo-realism of the early films is gone in favor of slick comic book sci-fi gloss. Whatever the series loses in thrills it makes up for in fun. Bond-o-meter Rating 81 points out of 100.

Diamonds are Forever falls in the former category although I'm not totally sure why. It's like after the serious action-packed 60's they decided to just calm down and relax, this is the most chilled out and mellow Bond film there is. It has that air of coolness that only early 70's films seem to have. There is a plot of sorts but there's no rush to get there. John Barry's score is his most jazzy and laid back. You feel this was the Bond film that most inspired Tarentino. Do you think so Mr Wint, I do Mr Kidd. Connery seems to really enjoy himself playing Bond again, now surprisingly looking older than his forty years although he was still younger than Roger Moore when he played Bond for the first time the following year, the role seems to fit him even better than before.

Apart from a good close quarters punch up in a lift, there is hardly any. What remains is lacking in energy and played mainly for laughs. 007 beaten up by two acrobatic women - until he just holds them underwater in a swimming pool. An awful slapstick car-trashing chase in Vegas. And the big finale is anything but. We have a few of Blofled's henchmen fighting a few helicopters. Bond does almost nothing except swing Blofeld's escape pod around with a crane.Which brings us to another point - this is without doubt the least serious Bond movie ever. It is borderline comedy throughout, clearly influenced by the likes of The Man from UNCLE and the Batman TV show. Blofeld dresses in drag at one stage. Most of the supporting characters are comic relief. The sinister henchmen, Wint and Kidd, would stand out in any other movie due to their extreme black humour, but here they are just wasted. Jill St John's Tiffany Case is amongst the worst Bond girls, silly and helpless.We even see Q - in Vegas - cheating on a slot machine.At least Connery is back right? Wrong. He's clearly on set, but equally clearly thinking about his next round of golf. Even his delivery of 'Bond, James Bond' is awful. He isn't helped by some awful costume decisions, including a brown tweed suit, and a pink (!) tie. Connery's huge payout for this film means everything else looks cheaper than before; by the climax you have embarrassing helicopter explosions, clearly animated, that would have been superbly detailed model shots in previous (and later) movies.There is virtually nothing good to say about Diamonds. The film is so lacking in energy or excitement that only the plot manages to pull it along. It's a series of weird and comedic scenes that hardly feel like a Bond movie in any way, and it's hard to believe this came after On Her Majesty's Sceret Service. The film scrimps so much on the action that you are left watching a bizarre, parallel universe version of Bond where nothing remotely Bond-ish seems to happen. It feels almost like a live-action version of a Saturday morning Bond cartoon, watered down for the kids (Bond never even uses his gun).Two plus points; Shirey Bassey's theme tune is superbly atmospheric and mysterious. Jill St John is very sexy. That's it. Connery came back, the director of Goldfinger came back, and the result was this farce.

Panic! Producers replace him with Australian born George Lazenby, who makes On Her Majesty Secret Service. This film does reasonably well at the box office, but not as well as the previous episodes... Furthermore, a big part of the audiences and many critics savage Lazenby's performance, rather pale compared to Connery's Bond portrait. OHMSS has been revalued since, but at the time of the release it's perceived like a disappointment.In '71 producers hire American actor John Gavin for Diamonds are forever (DAF), but at the very last minute Sean Connery decides to come back to the role for one time only...The film is a kind of remake of Goldfinger -there is Sean, of course; director Guy Hamilton; Shirley Bassey sings the theme; the story takes place in America; here too we have glamorous elements (diamonds instead of gold).The movie is funny, Sean looks amused and quite relaxed in traveling between Amsterdam and Las Vegas to investigate about a diamond illegal traffic.Nevertheless it's the worst of his Bonds... It's his less interesting outing as 007. When we think about him as Bond we think about the episodes of the Sixties, when the series was at its beginning. Diamonds has not the classical atmosphere of Goldfinger and Thunderball -the rhythm of DAF is not constant, there are also too many jokes, and a more American humor of the movie spoils the Britishness of 007. The first part of the film is boring, the second half has more action -although the final battle scene is not very well done.Sean is Sean, but here he looks older than his age -curiously he looks fitter and more charming in Never say never again, an unofficial Bond done 12 years later! By the way his presence in this film saves the show completely and a good entertainment is guaranteed.

Connery was reluctant, but the huge sum he was offered to come back was too good to resist, and Diamonds are Forever thus became his last official Bond film. Sadly it is a thoroughly unworthy exit, for DAF is an inane, flabby film that suffers from lazy scripting and an excess of camp humour, reducing Bond to the level of self-parody.It seems that the aim of this film was to rekindle the spirit of Goldfinger, after audiences did not take kindly to the relatively serious OHMSS. Not only did Connery return, but so did Goldfinger director Guy Hamilton and other crew members who had worked on that film; even Shirley Bassey was back to sing the theme tune, which is one of the few good things about DAF. However, it lacks either the wit or elegance of Goldfinger, relying instead on a succession of bad puns and tedious chase sequences, including a particularly stupid one which sees Bond being pursued across the desert while driving a moon buggy. The decision to set most of the film in Las Vegas does not help matters, for it is a very un-Bond like place which just serves to make the film feel even more cheap and tacky.The casting is a mixed bag. Connery never gave a bad performance as OO7, but he is at his most detached and uninterested here, going through the motions but never looking as if he is doing it for anything other than the money. Even though he was only 40 when he made it, he also looks rather old in this film, which does not help credibility. Charles Gray is OK as Blofeld, but plays it far too camp and never seems the slightest bit menacing, which is not a good idea if you are playing Bond's arch-enemy. Jill St John's Tiffany Case is a spirited Bond girl, but unaccountably she becomes more and more stupid as the film goes on, and never becomes as strong a character as she should have been. Wint and Kidd, Blofeld's homosexual henchmen, provide quite good comic value, even though they are outrageous gay stereotypes; nevertheless, their antics seem very out of place in a Bond film, being more suited to Are You Being Served. As for Jimmy Dean's Willard Whyte, I found him to be one of the most irritating characters in any Bond film, though thankfully he does not get much screen time.There are some good points in the film, including an effective fight between Bond and Peter Franks in Amsterdam, and a memorable scene in which OO7 has to grapple with two striking young women called Bambi and Thumper. In general, however, DAF feels tired, trying to compensate for the lack of a decent script with its childish humour and endless stunts. It is all a long way away from the classic Connery Bonds of the early 60s, and indeed DAF is much closer in tone to the jokey Roger Moore films that would follow it during the rest of the 70s, although most of those have more going for them than this film. All in all, DAF is more of a feeble exercise in camp comedy than a stylish spy thriller, a sad way for Connery to leave the part that had made him a star. Of all the Bond films, probably only Moonraker is worse.  "},{"Title":"BOND#7 What Doesn't Stay in Vegas? Bond!","Date":"2 June 2007","Score":"15 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" MASTER PLAN steal a lot of diamonds to fashion an orbiting super-duper laser to, guess what, blackmail the world! The pre-credits teaser functions as an epilogue to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Bond hunting his arch-nemesis, Blofeld, in a quick series of scenes throughout the world. The filmmakers tried to recapture the best of Goldfinger in this one, using the same director and singer Bassey on the credits again. Ending up with even a pale imitation of the best Bonder is not such a bad thing, but it also points to the lack of originality besetting the series by this time. This one probably breaks the record for unusual types of killings, mostly courtesy of gay assassins Wint & Kidd, who go through a bunch of victims very quickly early on. The odd flavor and juxtaposition (detail of diamond smuggling over surreal liquidations) is an attempt to make Bond edgy & relevant now that the seventies began. The danger with all the attempts to be unusual, whether in regard to deaths or chases, is that it dips into a cutesy atmosphere a bit too far. Those fans fond of the seriousness in the previous film would probably not be amused, since it comes across as a dark parody of the usual spy stuff. That being said, Wint & Kidd, who represent the worst excesses of this film, end up as the highlights. From their very first scene in the desert, where they seem to draw inspiration from a scorpion, these two oddballs have the audience guessing on what they would do next - they are goofy, yes, but also lethal - interesting because they are somewhat original.Bond's mission, tracking an involved diamond smuggling operation, takes him briefly to Amsterdam, but he ends up in Las Vegas for most of the story. A subplot involves a missing billionaire, obviously patterned after Howard Hughes, who was still living as a recluse at this time. M and, especially Moneypenny, have less screen time in this one, though Q pops up in an amusing scene testing one of his gizmos on some one-armed bandits (Vegas is no match for Q). Though the scenes in Vegas itself are less exotic than those of most Bond films, the film also makes good use of the surrounding desert terrain and there are numerous grand sets, notably a huge futuristic lab building, complete with tests of a fake moon landing, as well as a house built into the rocks. There is a good auto chase on the streets of Vegas, which has the infamous 'two-wheely' by Bond thru an alley. The two weird assassins pop up every now and then; they even have their own theme score, an eerie yet playful little tune. One of them looks very strange (Smith, a jazz musician with no acting experience), while the other (actor Glover, father of Crispin Glover) looks more normal but has very strange inflections to his speech. Every time they show up, a strange tension surfaces for the viewer. Besides Wint & Kidd, other outrageous foes for Bond include Bambi & Thumper, two wild martial arts girls who nearly knock his teeth in. Their scene has a lot of energy and you won't soon forget them. The story is well-paced for the most part, with less of those slow spots that afflicted many of the later Bonders. However, a couple of deleted scenes with the Plenty character makes things a bit confusing for her character arc.Connery is, of course, several years older since his last Bonder, but he looks pretty much the same as he did in You Only Live Twice. There may be a hint of grey around the edges and, in his scenes with M, it no longer comes across as 'the old man and the wiseguy kid' repartee, despite their best efforts. But Bond is still the ideal male here and it's still believable that femme fatale Tiffany falls for him by the end. She's a curious mixture of flaky girl and worldly woman, usually flippant in her approach, sort of reflecting the trivial nature of this Bonder, where nothing happening is really of grave import. That's why, when Blofeld's (him again) real plan is revealed, it's a bit out of left field; all of sudden, we see a super laser detonating missiles around the globe and everything has changed into matters of international import. Blofeld, as played by Gray, is more urbane and effeminate than the previous two versions, more attuned to a villain planning world domination, but he's also too civilized, too polite to Bond in the climactic sequence, diffusing his threatening presence. CIA liaison Leiter recalls the non-descript Leiter of Goldfinger, as well. The climax on that oil rig sea platform in Baja is not very well done, with Blofeld's end especially disappointing (he would not return, except in the teaser of For Your Eyes Only). But, the epilogue is excellent. Bond, but not Connery, would return in Live and Let Die.

This film on first viewing appearts bizarre and weird but actually grows on you after several viewings. It has many weird facets - not least the background music you hear playing on the very first shots of the Willard Whyte Towers ( I wonder what the building really was - presumably some office block in Las Vegas ), weird also the two homosexual killers who are in fact very frightening in their modus operandi, thank God they got their just desserts on the boat at the end - I was waiting for that one. And there's old No-neck Charles Gray with his superb upper class english accent (like me !) who plays a weird villain, not credible all the time but nevertheless amusing. And there's those two weird Girls Thumber and Bambi who prance around like monkeys at WW's summer house ! And there's Willard Whyte himself, God, what a strange accent he has, sound's like a 1970's cowboy. It seems incredible he has been locked up for five years in a flat and never managed to escape. When I compare this film to the rubbish they put into Goldeneye and The world in not enough, I actually found it better than I thought on first viewing. Also the plot is a bit complicated and rather disarms on first viewing. But having watched the film four times, I now find the action sequences very good, especially the shoot out on the oil-rig at the end. Bond's female companion JSJ is absolutely gorgeous and seems to have aged well like good wine ( on the dvd there is an interview with her today ). So all in all I think the film will age well and gain value in time to come whereas when it came out, it was probably considered rather Obsure. True, Connery's performance itself is less good than in previous Bonds, but the rest makes up for this. Note also the superb theme song by Shirley Bassey and the graphically beautiful opening credits which are amongst the best of all the Bond Films.............

After four years, 1.25 million dollars, an agreement to receive one-eighth of the film's gross profit, and a commitment to finance two additional projects of his choice, Connery returned for another spin as the world's deadliest government agent. Sadly, the man who electrified the world for six years returned for a problematic movie that at best is a disappointment and at worst a large black stain on his legacy.Many of the problems that drown Diamonds Are Forever show up in the opening minutes. It begins where On Her Majesty's Secret Service ends. Bond is on the revenge trail following the murder of his wife. Connery's face remains hidden to raise anticipation, but when it finally appears, my reaction is shock.At one time he looked like the handsome, debonair ladies man he is supposed to be, but at 41, Connery has outlived the part. He has more wrinkles, his eyes have darkened with age, he is getting fatter, and his hair is grayer. I once watched a clip online of a scene where he is standing next to Q, played by Desmond Llewelyn, who was 56 years old with white hair. I initially mistook him for one of Q's assistants.From Russia with Love displayed Connery at his best. In every possible way, he made the part his own with an authority neither he nor the five actors following him have since been able to equal. This time he was just doing it for the money, and it shows. In Goldfinger, he said Bond, James Bond with focus and cool. Here, it is delivered with unexpressive staccato. When he is ordered to put up his hands, he moves them to the side like a man bored with being bored.Diamond smuggling out of South Africa has risen over the past two years. Since no smuggled stones have reached the market, the British government fears somebody may be accumulating them in preparation for a market dump. A string of recent murders in South Africa leads them to fear that operations are being shut down, leaving them little time to bust the smugglers. James Bond is sent undercover as smuggler Peter Franks. His mission takes him to the casinos of Las Vegas, where he discovers the involvement of his old enemy, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray).Gray is another problem evident from the beginning. Blofeld is supposed to be bald, but even if Gray was bald he would not remotely look or sound the part. In From Russia with Love, Blofeld seemed like a god. Gray is not imposing, and seeing the mighty Blofeld dressing as a transvestite is the worst insult in the series. For the ignominious title of worst Bond villain, Gray loses to Stephen Berkoff from Octopussy, but barely.When Bond finally discovers Blofeld, how does he react? He indulges in polite conversation. The movie forgets that Bond is speaking to the man who callously murdered his wife, and that Blofeld is addressing the man who broke his neck.Another huge minus is the general lack of excitement. It has a good start with an intense elevator fight between Bond and the real Peter Franks. If you see this film, which I strongly discourage, savor that fight, because Diamonds becomes pretty anemic afterwards. The remainder lacks intrinsic interest or excitement. Aside from a slick nighttime street chase, the little action that is left looks fake and slow. When Bond is faced with trouble, what does he do? He runs, preferably in a phony moon machine. From start to finish, he does not fire a single bullet. Adding insult is the cheap climax. Six years earlier, this franchise won a visual effects Oscar. Now they are reduced to creating nuclear explosions that look like puffs of smoke. Connery's salary supposedly slashed the special effects budget even though the franchise made over a 400 million dollar profit since Goldfinger. Two musicians are cast in supporting roles. Imagine Quantum of Solace casting Garth Brooks and Wynton Marsalis. Ironically, it is country singer Jimmy Dean who brings the most convincing act to the table. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are wasted as the bimbo and harlot, respectively. Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) are the gay hit men who don't know each other's first names, and the best I can say about them is that they die entertainingly.Diamonds Are Forever marked the beginning of sad decade for Agent 007. Were it not for The Spy Who Loved Me, the series likely would have died. A movie with shoddy writing, substandard acting, misplaced atmosphere and bad characters cannot succeed. Diamonds slowly decay into other forms of carbon, so they are not truly forever. Neither is Sean Connery.

With that case wrapped up he is set to work investigating diamonds being smuggled out of South Africa. His sent to Amsterdam where he poses as a known smuggler to get the diamonds of one Tiffany Chase.

Here he learns that they aren't being smuggled for financial reasons but to be used in a satellite based weapon&#x85; will he be able to prevent it being used against Washington DC? As said before this is less serious then the previous films; I don't think it is bad though; in fact I've always rather enjoyed it. Charles Gray does a good job as arch-villain Blofeld but Putter Smith and Bruce Glover steal the show as Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint; a pair of creepy killers who have a 'witty' line for every occasion. Jill St John does a fine job as Tiffany Case but the other 'Bond Girl' in this film, Lana Wood, who plays the appropriately named Plenty O'Toole, is rather under-used. The story is good enough although there are one or two plot holes&#x85; for example Tiffany checks fingerprints to identify Bond as the smuggler but has no photograph of the real smuggler. As one would expect from a Bond film there are plenty of stunts, action and explosions. Over all I'd recommend this to other Bond fans even though it isn't a classic.

Connery returned here for three principal reasons. Despite the box-office success of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, Lazenby's post-production antics and monetary demands cost him a job. US actor John Gavin (mercifully) declined the role in this film and thirdly public demand and an offer he couldn't refuse (something to do with truck-loads of cash), induced Connery so slap on the old hairpiece once more! Looking visibly older, though not in any way detrimental to the role, Sean revels in what obviously (to him) was his swansong as 007. Almost a complete turnaround in style from his established mega-serious British Agent in his previous five outings, Bond is having FUN! Virtually a total send up of the entire franchise to date, Bond veritably dribbles double entendres unloading on the audience probably the rudest and funniest dialog of the series. Pick of the flick? I'm Plenty O'Toole to which Bond quips, Named after your father are you?The plot is more or less made up as they went along and is just plain incidental to the Movie. Campy beyond belief, even to the extent of having a pair of confrontingly homosexual killers who bumble their way to annihilation at the film's conclusion. Most Bond purists choked on their martinis with the release of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The way to enjoy this one is to let it flow....don't compare it! Have no expectations and let Connery entertain you. One right out of the bag here. If you want it to fit a pre-conceived mould, you're in for a major disappointment. For God's sake how seriously could you take a Bond film starring singer Jimmy Dean, not to mention a couple of beefed up exquisitely proportioned female minders called Bambi and Thumper?One of the Bonds that has improved with age AND multiple viewings.

I should say it was good to see Sean Connery back in the role of Bond after his 1 movie hiatus and this outing I most say does seem to fit better than previous ones.

The main Bond girl is Jill St. John (age 30) as Tiffany Case. The nemesis is Charles Gray as Blofeld, and we find out he hatched a plan to take control of a commercial satellite launch with a laser, and using the diamonds as a way to make the lasers many times more powerful, enough so that it can destroy from space. Washington becomes threatened.The final action takes them to a Baha California offshore oil platform, where Blofeld has established a base of operations for the threat. Looking back at this movie made almost 45 years ago it is somewhat cheesy by today's standard. But I never expect a James Bond movie to be any more than that, cheesy action and cheesy fights. The entertainment is to see how many novel situations the writers can imagine Bond getting into, always in suit and tie, and the novel ways they have him getting out of trouble. Often it would be easy to eliminate James Bond and solve the issue of him on the trail, but James Bond never gets killed! I enjoyed it, I was entertained. It was fun seeing a young Lana Wood as Plenty O'Toole, she was gorgeous at 24, but her scenes were cut short in editing.

This guy wasn't the same as the Blowfelt in You Only Live Twice but hey AT LEAST HE WAS BETTER THAN THE GUY IN ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE!Anyway, his performance was good and I enjoyed how he created a double of himself.Another part of this movie that I loved was Mr. Wint and Mr. Kid. They played really good roles and I enjoyed their performance. I feel like Mr. Wint was one of those guys who would be saying something like, Boy, this building is quite high up. It would be a shame if someone were to fall off.I give Diamonds Are Forever a 7.5 out of 10 for having the return of Sean Connery, characters like Mr. Wint and Kid, and just being a fun film.

He had aged since his appearance in You Only Live Twice, but his no-nonsense confidence worked very well with a terrific, fast-moving story that constantly surprised and entertained. Critics, notably Pauline Kael, enjoyed the witty, sardonic script that deftly referenced the modern takes on subjects like the Funeral business and Howard Hughes's disconcerting reclusiveness. Like the best Bond movies, it took you on a tour of an exotic location, and Mankiewicz' Las Vegas was one of the best uses of a location in the Bond oeuvre. Mankiewicz kept the movie moving, while inserting memorable and funny bits of business along the way. Morton Slumber, Shady Tree, Plenty O'Toole, among others, are perfectly realized minor characters, and cast perfectly. Not to mention Jimmy Dean as Willard Whyte, who brings cornball gusto to the role. This film was a balance of humor and credibility that the series never again equaled, and after this the irony quickly curdled.

The Beatles split up, Jim Morrison flat-lined in a bathtub and Vietnam was napalming the American dream to ashes in a controversial conflict that was fast starting to look like an epic fail.The Bond movies had been spoofed, ripped-off, imitated to near death and creatively dismissed by many critics. Lazenby had jumped ship, convinced that Bond was old hat and had no future other than a rattling decline into celluloid oblivion. This smacks of the same type of miscalculation made by the Decca A&R exec who turned down signing The Beatles because guitar bands are on the way out. New American cinema was starting to turn out some of the greatest genre defining movies ever made. The world was going all glam, glitter and shock-rock - Alice Cooper, Slade, New York Dolls, Sweet, David Bowie.And the original Bond returns in a glitzy, camp, sci-fi extravaganza, that still manages to be the fourth highest grossing film in the US of it's year. Ahead of Dirty Harry, Carnal Knowledge, A Clockwork Orange, Klute, The Last Picture Show and Bedknobs and Broomsticks. No indicator of quality, but certainly of a sustained popularity.DAF is a slyer, more-knowing, self-deprecating artifact of it's time than most give it credit for. In it's sweep, it satirises the absurdity of Howard Hughes and his eccentric reclusivity, the global obsession over the lunar landings (and accompanying conspiracy theory surrounding beliefs of their fakeness), the conquest of space, and pokes fun at the mecca of arbitrary gambling-addicts and those dazzled by the air-headed neon facade of sleazy, hollow glamour.Beneath the veneer of such glamour, death lurks, dispensed by two gay contract killers in the pay of a criminal cross-dressing mastermind with a penchant for white cats and impersonating a reclusive kidnapped multi-millionaire industrialist. And making doubles of himself - for some reason. Are we beginning to grasp it's charm yet? There are so many continuity, plot and logic errors in DAF, that sooner or later one might suspect they are deliberate. Connery coasts through, nonchalant and laid-back and still irrefutably BOND. DAF, it's fair to say, lost the plot, in the tipsy haze of a high-tech Rat Pack hangover. But, as a kid I loved it unconditionally, and I still think it's a blast today. OK, it may not have aged as well as some of it's counterparts from the sixties and seventies, but at the time and in the climate it was released, the escapism it provided and the way in which it integrated/resonated with the mood and flavour of that time and climate, made it stellar entertainment. There's something about it's inherent sincerity and lack of forced, contrived, self-conscious cynicism that appeals.There are some crackling one-liners and dialogue, a ferociously brutal unarmed combat episode in a lift, an eye-melting pink tie, bizarre vehicle chases and the most unconvincing toupee a leading actor ever wore up to that point. It had a bizarre life of it's own.Oh, did I mention Connery was back as Bond? I'd pay the price of admission for that fact alone. Wouldn't you?

It keeps all of the trappings and recurrent characters we had come to expect in a 007 film but adds a few novel twists which keep things from becoming stale. Connery's co-star and female lead this time is Jill St. John and forgive me while I drool on my keyboard a moment. The term 'drop dead gorgeous' must have been invented for her and maybe even specifically for this movie. Casual nudity in mainstream cinema was not yet commonplace, but some of Ms. St. John's 'costumes' come about as close as is possible. As Bond aptly puts it shortly after meeting her character, Tiffany Case, that's a nice little nothing you're almost wearing. Bond has a number of great one-liners in 'Diamonds Are Forever,' and Connery delivers them in a breezy, laid-back performance. The diamonds in question are to be used on a satellite to focus a laser beam that will destroy nuclear weapons, allowing SPECTRE to blackmail various governments. Yeah, that old plot again. But it's just enough to hang a number of funny and exciting scenes on, starting in Holland and ending up in Las Vegas. Maybe the oddest aspect of 'Diamonds Are Forever' is the inclusion of two openly and sometimes outlandishly gay characters, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. They are operatives/assassins in the employ of SPECTRE and appear at crucial times throughout the film... always together. The plot sometimes veers off into extreme silliness (it's hard to recall a chase scene sillier than the one with Bond in the moon-buggy) and the special effects range from believable to incredibly cheesy (the shot of Chinese missiles being destroyed and a flaming Chinese soldier crossing the screen has to be seen to be believed) which, along with the above-mentioned aspects, seem to indicate the series was heading in a more comedic direction just as Connery was making his exit. Whether this was an improvement is debatable, but Connery was, and is, the definitive Bond and 'Diamonds Are Forever' stands as one of the best 007 films.

This is in fact untrue. 'Forever' premiered in London on 30 December; it did not go on general release until the following day when it went on to outperform every other film in Britain in 1972. But I digress; the seventh 007 epic saw a brief return to the role for Sean Connery, who'd vacated Bond's shoes for 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' ( 1969 ), now ( rightly ) regarded as one of the all-time great Bond films, but at the time it was deemed to have been a failure. David Picker, head of United Artists, lured the recalcitrant actor back with the offer of a huge pay cheque and the promise of funding for three movies of his choice. The new decade saw a change in style for the Bond movies. The 60's ones were tongue-in-cheek but mock-serious. The only one to adopt a lighter tone was 'Goldfinger' ( 1964 ). It was to recapture that tone that producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman brought back director Guy Hamilton. This is no more apparent than in the scene in Slumber's Funeral Parlour - 'Morton Slumber' ( the late David Bauer ) could have wandered out of an episode of 'The Avengers'. The Fleming novel had Bond going undercover ( impersonating one 'Peter Franks', whom British Intelligence have captured ) to infiltrate a gang of diamond smugglers, one of whom is the beautiful 'Tiffany Case'. Much action is centred around Las Vegas. Tom Mankiewicz and Richard Maibaum's script retained the early part of the novel, but then deviated from it with 'Ernst Stavro Blofeld' ( Charles Gray ) yet again planning to hold the world to ransom, this time with a laser-satellite ( full of diamonds ) orbiting the Earth.Connery gives one of his best performances as Bond, certainly better than the one he gave in 'You Only Live Twice' in which he was virtually on auto-pilot throughout. No wonder audiences cheered when he once again said that famous line  My name is Bond...James Bond!. Charles Gray makes for an elegantly caddish 'Blofeld', delivering wry quips through cigarette smoke like an evil Noel Coward. Before anyone says 'Blofeld should not be British!', look at it this way - would not a man on the run from the intelligence services try to throw them off the scent in some imaginative way? Pretending to be another nationality makes perfect sense. The pre-credits sequence has Bond hunting the world for Blofeld ( presumably to get revenge for wife Tracy's death, its never made clear ). In South America, he finds him experimenting with clones. After a fight, Blofeld is sent hurtling face-first into a mud pool, but of course, it isn't really him. Maurice Binder's title sequence kicks in to the welcome return of Shirley Bassey's vocals.'Forever' features Bond's first gay characters ( not counting 'Rosa Klebb' ) in the shape of killers 'Mr.Kidd' ( Putter Smith ) and 'Mr.Wint' ( Bruce Glover ), while 'Tiffany' ( the stunning Jill St.John ) is far more brash than previous Bond girls. Lana Wood shines briefly as the ill-fated 'Plenty O'Toole'. Those who dismiss the Roger Moore era for its wacky humour need to realise that the trend towards self parody in fact began here. The action sequences are a mixed bag; the fight in the lift between Bond and Peter Franks ( Joe Robinson ) is one of the very best to grace a 007 film, ditto the bruising encounter with 'Bambi' ( Lola Larson ) and 'Thumper' ( Trina Parks ), the moon buggy chase and Les Vegas car chase stunning ( remember Bond's car being driven on two wheels? ), but best of all is the scene where Bond ascends the Whyte House to break into reclusive millionaire Willard Whyte ( Jimmy Dean )'s sumptuous apartment. Some gorgeous sets by Ken Adam here. John Barry's score is one of his best ( my favourite track is '007 & Counting', heard as Blofeld's satellite goes about the globe causing havoc ). On the down side, the final helicopter assault on Blofeld's oil rig headquarters is flat and uninspired, like something out of a made-for-television film.'Forever' is far from being classic Bond, but manages to be watchable and has some wonderful moments; for instance, when 'Felix Leiter' ( Normann Burton ) asks Bond where on Franks' corpse the diamonds have been hidden, he gets the reply Alimentary, Dr.Leiter!. It silenced critics who had claimed that Bond was washed-up and set the standard for the Moore 007 movies to follow. Connery would play the role only one more time, in 1983's 'Never Say Never Again'.

The end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service clearly shows that Bond should want vengeance, I would if I were in that situation. I think that may have also helped it gain more success, although its did make $44,000,000 upon release, at todays standard thats $180,000,000. It went on to make $116,000,000 worldwide, today thats $480,000,000. Of all the films thats the 4th most profitable.Its evident although a great film, sort of a cult classic, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) jinxed this production. Its evident they wanted to avoid failure, by removing all evidence of it. By forgetting its finale. Also the return of Sean Connery, not only a  addition that would help people for OHMSS, to this film, but also an insult to George Lazenby, who wasn't fired. Lazenby was certainly not better than Connery, but his departure was mistake and a failure. Diamonds Are Forever although to many a failure, is a very good film. But it also helped to make the forgotten Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). In my mind if Diamonds Are Forever failed OHMSS will be remembered, final failure standout. I don't think anyone will forgot how awful BATMAN & ROBIN (1998) was. Although of course now OHMSS wouldn't be a failure. But this film also represented change a change that started after You Only Live Twice and would stop after Live And Let Die (1973) and wouldn't occur again until The Living Daylights (1987), although technically happen early in Sean Connery's second comeback Never Say Never Again (1983).

Well, his work here feels a little bit uninspired - sometimes he seems to get in a light mood, and play it for laughs. Maybe I had done that myself, knowing that the 007-stage door was to be closed for good after this. They actually tried to buy him back once again for Live And Let Die. (Connery this time demanded way out fantasy money, and was never considered.) This is not as much a legendary classic as his 60's flicks, but good entertainment on the way, with the Vegas environment and so. But the avenging his murdered wife thing could have been developed, and stretched out for a while. That part is treated very shallow, almost just skin-deep, I think. The vicious planning of blackmailing the world (via a laser-gun satellite) from Blofeld is wearisome - feels like a flimsy development of the Virus Omega in OHMSS, and the hijacking of spaceships in YOLT - and Charles Gray's portrait of him isn't that memorable at all. The whole movie seems to me pretty flashy and airy compared to it's forerunners, but hey, the 70's just begun....the decade when sideburns and flares was to rule the world for a while. Red super-car (Ford Mustang Mach I) and red head girl (Jill St. John) adorns the movie good, but feels a little second grade still, to what we could have been presented if they had used some more skill in the script plans. I place this Bond movie somewhere in the lower-middle ranking among all the others, but can very well bear to revisiting it when it somehow comes in my way from time to time. There was a whole new era of James Bond on the way...with a guy who's marathon session none could have predicted at the time. J.B Mk. III.

George Lazenby famously turned his back on the Bond franchise, looking at the brave new counter culture films like Easy Rider as the way forward, and Bond as a rapidly moulding relic of the 60s. We know now that Bond has continued to pack out cinemas on each release, but following Lazenby's departure, the question was a troubled 'what now?'.Bond traditionalists are still crying out 'bring back Connery!'. And for DAF, they did. Connery was tempted back with a record-breaking 1.25 million, which he did donate in full to the Scottish International Education Trust, but this is rather the only positive that can be said about this involvement here. Connery was tired with the Bond franchise, and it's clear from his performance that he did not have his heart in the film, and gives a rather cynical performance. He had also visibly aged and put on weight. Ironically, he looked far fresher in his return in Never Say Never Again some 12 years later.Just like the decade itself, DAF is much more violent than it's predecessors, with some pretty grisly deaths (immolation, drowning, and a scorpion dropped down the back of the neck), however, the brutal fight in the elevator with Peter Franks is superbly choreographed, and in an era where Bond appeared to stroll through his fights with ease, this scene showed Bond meeting a true equal, fighting with a real sense of grit and intensity not seen elsewhere.One of the real weak points of DAF are the locations. Whilst other films in the series were set in places that the audience dreamed of going to (or sometimes didn't dare to go to), 1970s Las Vegas looks naff and lacks any kind of glitz, giving the film rather a cheap wood-panelled 'made for TV' veneer. However, what I really found unforgivable about DAF was it's continuity following OHMSS, something that has given some Bond fans cause to rather consider DAF to be a sequel to You Only Live Twice, and OHMSS to follow on from DAF. Following the murder of his wife, Theresa, on his wedding night, Bond should be explosive with anguish and rage. Although the opening scene shows Bond roughing up a few suspects, he seems to regard Blofeld, now a camp caricature better suited to a 1970s sitcom, little more than an old rogue, seemingly no more angry with him for murdering his wife, than he would be for keying his car. This was such an opportunity missed, and leaves me wondering how it would have been if Lazenby stayed and DAF intentionally scripted as a direct follow- up.DAF for me is the 'interim Bond, lost between the optimistic pop- Bond of the 60s, and the escapist romps of the later 70s. Fortunately the follow up, Live And Let Die, tapped into a new fun, playful Bond, and gave the franchise a lifeline, one that was later cemented with The Spy Who Loved Me. Connery on the other hand was finally allowed to act his age, and followed up DAF with 1973's The Offence, in my opinion the most intense and outstanding performance of his career.

When the overall plot isn't particularly great or perhaps too far-fetched, like for example the case in Diamonds are Forever, there are still various other reasons that make any particular 007 installment must- see material! Apart from the wonderful fact that Sean Connery returned one final time to play cinema's most legendary secret agent &#x96; officially at least &#x96; there are plenty of other fantastic elements in Diamonds are Forever. The proficient Las Vegas filming locations, for starters, but even more so the uniquely tense & original sequences at the mortuary and a handful of truly offbeat but marvelous supportive characters; most notably a couple of queer but nefarious homosexuals killers, a strong female lead and a sexy duo of bikini-bodyguards named after cute Disney animals. And, come to think of it, the actual plot is more than thrilling and competent enough as well, it's just too bad about that clumsy and almost ridicule climax. After finally having settled an old score with his nemesis Blofeld, 007 is assigned to unravel a diamond smuggling network that stretches itself from South Africa over Holland and all the way to fabulous Las Vegas! Bond takes over the identity of a notorious runner after killing him and travels to the USA with the sexy female crook Tiffany Case. In Vegas, Bond gradually discovers that the contraband-diamonds serve a very peculiar purpose and that the recluse tycoon high up in his Vegas hotel is perhaps not that unknown&#x85; The plot derails entirely in the last half hour, but at least until then Diamonds are Forever has been a very exhilarating and cool 007-adventure. It's particularly entertaining to witness how Bond's opponents insist to try and annihilate him via bizarre and convoluted tricks&#x85; If they would just shoot a few bullets in head from close range, the franchise would have been finished since Dr. No already! I also don't want to blindly follow popular opinions, but Sean Connery truly is and forever will remain the greatest James Bond. He provides the character with a kind of self- parody that none of the other protagonists ever could accomplish. In this film, Connery also receives excellent support from a handful of multi-talented fellow cast members, like the stunningly beautiful ladies Jill St. John and Lana Wood (although the latter's role is sadly underdeveloped) and eccentric sidekick villains Putter Smith and Bruce Glover as the frolic duo Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint. Even though I'm a big admirer of Charles Gray, he is most definitely a much weaker Blofeld than both Donald Pleasance and Telly Savalas. Horror and cult fanatics will also recognize the fantastic Sid Haig (Spider Baby, House of 1.000 Corpses) in a small but memorable role as mortuary attendant. "},{"Title":"Right idea, Mr Bond. Wrong pussy...","Date":"1 May 2012","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" A greying Connery returns for an enjoyable but only occasionally 18-carat entry, his last for the Eon Bonds. Jill St John makes a gutsy heroine and Charles Gray the iciest and best of the Blofelds. But the gags are overdone (and would be from now on) and the ending weak.The producers also brought back director Guy Hamilton but the untidy screenplay doesn't allow for the polish of his earlier 'Goldfinger'. A tight shooting schedule, a contractual condition by Connery, explains the somewhat hurried look of 'Diamonds are Forever' (the drainpipe sequence, for instance, is so shoddily cut it seems assembled from discarded outtakes).And yet all the elements of a great Bond thriller are here. A mysterious hi-tech desert installation, a hidden jungle surgery complete with bubbling sulphur-pit, a car-chase along the Las Vegas Strip (that admittedly seemed more daring then than now), a world-threatening plot, a wonderfully tense confrontation between 007 and two Blofelds in a stainless steel penthouse. Unfortunately, that's really the last interesting sequence in the film.Despite the introduction of the laser-satellite, it loses what narrative verve it has and the subsequent events aren't charged with enough urgency. The final set-piece battle is a disappointment; a converted oil rig of the Californian coast hardly provides for a very spectacular climax or a memorable interior set to focus the action on. In fact, the satellite control-room must be about the least inspired set that designer Ken Adams has ever come up with. And some of the explosion effects are glaringly poor.What a pity. Because John Barry comes up with yet another distinctively superb score, memorably the harsh discordant sax for the desert sequences that also acts as the recurring musical leit motif for the murderous gay couple Mr Wint and Mr Kidd, as well as that clamorous, piercing piece with piccolos that accompanies the fight scenes. And cinematographer Ted Moore well captures the neon-hard local colour and the arid starkness of the hinterland, noticeably in the very high angle shot of Bond's red Ford trailing Metz' minibus out of Las Vegas into the desert.The real pleasure of the film is Connery, though. If the trim figure that began nine years earlier has gone, along with the muscle-tone, he's more relaxed and assured than ever in in a role that by now fits him like a glove, despite a five-year absence.The role is his, absolutely, and he knows it.

Connery has been unjustly accused of going through the motions the iconic role that made him is star. While he comes across campy at times due to his mannerisms not fitting his ageing looks, contrary to popular belief it's clear that he puts in 100 percent especially in the fight scenes notable the lift set up where he kills 'James Bond'.Director Guy Hamilton's use of the (at the time) contemporary setting of Las Vegas gives Diamonds a slightly dated look and it appears less classic than earlier outings, also the production feel cheaper especially compared to its predecessor.The practical stunts are great from the aforementioned lift fight, to the car chases and finale. Like its setting the score is less classic/traditional and very '70s, of its day, but the theme (belted out wonderfully) by Shirley Bassey is excellent and the tune appears throughout. Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz's screenplay is as many of the Bond films - a mixture of great adventure and excitement, that is let down by some unnecessary injected humour as oppose to wittiness. However, it's interesting and different departing from the typical Bond style. This coupled with the real locations and Ken Adams toned down sets retain that Bond je ne sais quoi. Charles Gray who appears in You Only Live Twice (1967) as Henderson, is now main antagonist Ernst Stavro Blofeld, he's a great actor but at times hams it up in almost Rocky Horror show proportions and comes off quite comedic instead of dangerous. Both Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn as Q return in there enjoyable roles, Moneypenny notable not behind a desk and aids Bond. The supporting cast especially the crooks are well cast, older looking wise guys, gangster types that give the film a little weight. Jill St. John as diamond smuggler Tiffany Case is refreshing as a Bond girl, while not the most classically beautiful, her character has a rough frank feistiness about her. The Blofeld's two villain accomplices are memorable and although clearly a gay couple, they are far more menacing than Blofeld himself especially Bruce Glover's Mr. Wint.Mostly set in Vegas, California and Amsterdam it's also probably the least exotic of the Bond's. That said, it's still a fun adventure with one some of the most memorable dialogue of the series.

The whole film is just a lackluster effort. It's hard to believe that this was directed by Guy Hamilton, the director of Goldfinger. By all means, after the end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, it would have been appropriate to have a dark revenge story, but we didn't get that. We instead got basically a comedy.Sean Connery said never again after You Only Live Twice, but after George Lazenby's less-than-well-received performance in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, they had to persuade Connery to come back for a large sum of money. It pains me to say this, but he shouldn't have come back, because he just isn't at his best in this movie. He just seemed completely bored the whole time (well, that's probably because he was).Charles Gray is absolutely abominable as Blofeld. He is not Blofeld at all. Bring back Donald Pleasence or even Telly Savalas. Just thinking about Gray's Blofeld makes me want to hit something.There are way too many silly elements to this film. Yes, it's ideal for a Bond film to have silly elements, but the best Bond films combined substance with that. This film has no such substance.The action scenes lack the energy and tension of the best Bond films. Also, I find Jill St. John as Tiffany Case to be an unmemorable Bond girl.That's not to say it's completely bad. The setting in Las Vegas is really lovely. Some of the jokes here and there are kind of funny, with the best jokes coming from Mr. Wint and Mr. Fib. I found them amusing, so sue me.Most of the Bond films have a great theme song, and this film is no exception, this time by Shirley Bassey.This is a thoroughly mediocre film, and pretty bad as far as Bond films go. This is easily the weakest Connery Bond film (excluding the unofficial Bond film, Never Say Never Again), and one of the worst of the series overall. This is recommended only if you are a die-hard Bond fan and want to see every single film.

Yes, Diamonds Are Forever is weak in plot, continuity, character motivation, and overall depth. Yet it's an awful lot of fun.When we first meet Sean Connery, back as Bond after a four-year absence, he's kicking the tar out of assorted people trying to locate Blofeld (Charles Gray). Once that's out of the way, he is called upon to help infiltrate a diamond-smuggling ring. Bond may think it's the sort of job that's beneath him, but he will find strong reason for seeing it through.It was the first Bond movie not made in the 1960s, and the culture shock is there from the start and continues all the way through. Long sideburns, Peckinpah-like blood splats, an old lady who teaches children religion but keeps a hollowed-out Bible for smuggling stolen goods. Blofeld is seen walking around in drag. His two main henchmen, Wint and Kidd, are not only apparently gay, but seem to have a snarkily aloof attitude about their jobs. The Clubland atmosphere of Ian Fleming seems well behind us now.You've just killed James Bond, the lead female Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) cries.Not quite, but it's not the Bond you came to expect from earlier films.What works for me in this movie are three things. First is the music, particularly the wonderfully jaded title song, the best of any in the Bond series even if it was never a commercial hit; as well as the eerie flute-like theme that follows Wint and Kidd's appearances. Second, the clever off-kilter sensibility that successfully reworks the Bond model for a new age. Third, the humor, of satirical quips and the ever-reliable double-entendres we expect from 007.Why are we staying in the bridal suite of the Whyte House?In order to form a more perfect union.It's not a perfect film. At times, it's not even a very good one. Throughout the picture Bond gets into various scrapes he weasels out of with discomfiting ease. In fact, except for a harrowing elevator fight near the beginning of the film, there's not an instance where Bond is severely pressed.This is fine given Connery doesn't seem to be pressing much himself, He's just having fun and thus is in tune with the picture around him. Guy Hamilton, the director, never took his Bond movies too seriously, though he liked action-packed set-pieces, and thus a lot of goofy moments in Diamonds Are Forever skirt past with minimal fuss. I enjoy how the film sends itself up. Even Bond's way of approaching the villain's lair is played for a smile. Why sneak in when you can just parachute down inside a giant bubble?For some, maybe many, the problem with Diamonds Are Forever is the same as its virtue to me It never takes itself seriously. The producers are stretching the formula, taking some chances, and tweaking some cherished notions of what Bond films are about. Not all of it works, but it's a fun ride I enjoy taking.

Bond is at home wearing a dinner jacket in a casino - but not a casino like 'Circus Circus' populated by midwestern holidaymakers!

People either hate or love this one. Personally, I've always liked it. I think detractors get caught up on too many superficial things, like the few moments of juvenile humor, and don't appreciate this film for what it is a very stylish, moody and weird romp. They also incorrectly assume that, because Sean Connery was coming back one time only for a fantastic sum of money, that his heart wasn't in it. In fact, as real critics have often said, he gives his best and most relaxed performance as Bond since Goldfinger. Logic would tell you that he wanted to go out in style, especially since he was so wooden his last time out in You Only Live Twice. It's not his fault the lines written didn't conjure up the seriousness of From Russia With Love. This film is vastly different from what preceded it, so some didn't like the change. But they're the ones missing out, because there are many memorable scenes and characters. This movie is not about action and gadgets, but about the surreal interaction between the characters. One has to go no further than the opening pipeline sequence to see that. Furthermore, the dialogue is terrific, and one has to watch the movie over and over to grasp all the ingenious lines. Providing the collars and cuffs match and I'm afraid you caught me with more than my hands up are some of the best phrases ever uttered in a bond film. The characters themselves were equally fascinating. Wint & Kidd set the pace for the strange goings-on and are a refreshing break from all the strong-armed assassins (Jaws, Odd-Job) that seem to appear in the majority of bond films. Anyway, you don't see Mike Myers lampooning them in his Austin Powers series. And if you want realism, the fight with Peter Franks ranks right up there. A chunky and older Jill St. John is much more believable as a worldly feme-fatale than the parade of twenty-somethings we're typically presented with (Denise Richards, Tonya Roberts, etc...). And where is it written that the main Bond villain has to be someone as two-fisted as Bond? Charles Grey's Blofeld fits right in with the craziness, and at least he seems intellectually capable of taking on Bond and the world, as opposed to Donald Pleasance's spoiled-brat and Telly Savalas' New York gangster Blofelds. And for once, we can see where the protagonist's resources came from! (I won't go into details, because it would have to contain spoilers). Sure the action on the oil rig at the end is somewhat disappointing, but that's not what this film is about. The scene aboard the QEII at the very end (Mouton Rothschild is a claret)is more emblematic of the mood the film makers were trying to convey. In conclusion, if you don't watch this movie expecting a Bond action extravaganza, but concentrate on the characters and dialogue, you'll thoroughly enjoy it.

Because Diamonds are Forever","Date":"11 December 2001","Score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  With Diamonds are Forever as its starting point, the Bond series takes its first steps towards a revolution. Although Cubby Broccoli had yet to introduce the  style , technique and humour that the Bond movies employed to define the 70's Action/Adventure movies,didn't untill The Spy Who Loved me 1977, the blueprints to all the greatest 70's Bond movies are very evident and apparent with Diamonds are Forever. From the very start of the fantastic pre-credits sequence in wich Bond hunts down Blofeld, presumably to avenge his wifes death On Her Majesty's Secret Service, 1969, the claim is made that this is going to be lighter and more fun than anything  on a Bond movie since Goldfinger 1964. This is thanks to three important factors,  Guy Hamilton who directed Goldfinger is back to direct his first Bond movie since the 1964 classic. With him Hamilton brings along alot of comic book orientated ideas and a wondefuly imaginative and humourous writer in Tom Manciewicz. Manciewicz is youthful and more American in his ways of writing and this gives Diamonds a fresh and polished feel to characters and action sequences. Sadly the script for Diamonds is one of the less involving and suspenseful of the series but no less enjoyable. The third factor in Diamonds success is the return of Sean Connery. Relaxed and re-energised after his hiatus from On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Connery looks to be enjoying himself, and this seems to be an inspiration to the rest of the cast and the overall look of the movie. In truth, Diamonds Are Forever is one of the most enjoyable and original of the entire Bond series.It would have been nice perhaps that in the wake of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, George Lazenby and OHMSS's Director Peter Hunt had returned to do a follow up revenge story in wich Bond avenges Tersa Diana Rigg who was shot in the final moments of OHMSS. Sadly this wasn't to be. In its place we have the next best thing. Connery is back, the action is more fast and lighter, the sets are bigger and the characters are larger than life. Central to the success of the well written characters is the way in wich they are played, and Diamonds comes up with a killer cast. Charles Gray who was fantastic as a support in You Only Live Twice turns on the charm as a very subdued and eerie Blofeld. Perhaps working against Gray is the fact that the ghost of Telly Savalas, the best of the Blofelds echoes through the movie. Gray however is very comanding and humourous in the movie and it is refreshing to see a different look and style to the character. Equally impressive is Jill St John as Tiffany Case. St John comes over like Lucy from Charles Schultz Peanuts cartoons and in most movies this would seem out of place but gives Diamonds the humourous edge it needs. As efficient as St John is Lana Wood as Plenty O Toole. Wood is beautiful for the part and has a very apealing charm. Manciewicz provides Connery with one of the all time great Bond one-liners in conversation with Wood Hi Im Plenty, Plenty O Toole exclaims wood After your father Perhaps inquires Connery. Were as most Bonds give us one hench men, Diamonds gives us two, and homesexual ones at that. Mr Wint and Mr Kidd as portrayed by Bruce Glover and Putter Smith respectively are two of the most original creations of the action movie genre. The come across as some sort of Stoned Laurel and Hardy and again add to the humour and are vicious and nasty creations underneath the fun. Finally there is Jimmy Dean the Country music superstar who turns up here as the Howard Hughes clone Willard Whyte. Dean seems at first out of place in a Bond movie but eventually grows upon you as the humour escelates. Like most Bond movies there is at least one performance that doesn't work  Norman Burton as Felix Leiter. Burton has none of the style and charm Rick Van Nutter had in the role or the appeal that David Hedison would go on to have in future Bond movies. Burton is with out a doubt the worst of all the Leiters.Add to all this the wondeful backdrop of Las Vegas. Vegas contains one of the most flashy glamorous settings for a Bond movie, and it is easy to believe what is going on there. Ken Adams sets are again a joy to marvel at, particularly Blofelds fortress at the movies climax and individual creations like the Moonbuggy, an ugly creation intentionally so. Guy Hamilton gets the direction right with the action sequences, and Connery once again in control of things throws himself enthusiastically into  the role of Bond, more humour from Connery than we have ever seen before, and the action sequences once agin pack the punch. Diamonds however contains quite a few mistakes wich at times is distracting, the one obvious mistake is the sequence in the car chase in Vegas wich see's Bond and Plenty in a red sports car through a narrow alley, in order to fit in the car tilts to one side on its left wheels and an insert shot shows it tilting to its right side. Anyone who has ever tried that knows it is impossible! Mistakes come and go but with the pace so energetic you hardly notice. To support the energetic pace is John Barry's whirling and absorbing themes, a few notches down from them of OHMSS, But still efficient and mesmerising, and there is the traditional theme song, another classic sung with amazing skill by Shirley Bassey Goldfinger.Diamonds are Forever isn't all plain sailing. The plot of the movie is quite difficult at first to get stuck into, and as the characters a quite fresh and original it is difficult to appreciate them at first but they grow on you with time. The script as with You Only Live Twice has Bond struggling to grasp a space weapon from the hands of Blofeld, wich seems like an old song sung over. Thanks to Tom Manciewicz's fresh and enjoyable screenplay nothing seems tired, and Guy Hamilton milks everything he can from Comic Book/Pop Art humour and action. Manciewicz would later employ as simmilar writing style into Live and Let Die 1973 SupermanThe Movie 1978 and Superman II 1980, but it is with Diamonds that he learned his trade. It is quite sad to see Sean Connery in his last official and EON Bond movie. But at least he went out with a bang and not a whimper. Over the years he BECAME Jmaes Bond and if it wasn't for the likes of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan the series may have ended with him. Connery is fantastic in Diamonds are Forever, wich is a very enjoyable and well made movie, and a great start for Bond in the 1970's.You know what they say Sean, Never Say Never Again.   <div class=yn id=ynd_116103>  <form method=get    action=/register/login  > Was the above review useful to you?   <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit   name=ynb_116103_yes value=Yes    rel=login   > <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit  name=ynb_116103_no value=No   rel=login   >  </form>  </div>  <hr noshade=1 size=1 width=50% align=center>  <div>  <a href=/user/ur65769085/><img class=avatar src=http//ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTE2NzcxMzYxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA1NjcyODE@._V1._SX40_SY40_SS40_.jpg height=$avatar.image.size width=$avatar.image.size></a> <h2>The worst Connery as 007 film & among the worst ever made</h2> <img width=102 height=12 alt=2/10 src=http//i.media-imdb.com/images/showtimes/20.gif> Author <a href=/user/ur65769085/>M Allen</a> <small>from United States</small> <small>14 April 2016</small>  "},{"Title":"The worst Connery as 007 film & among the worst ever made","Date":"14 April 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":""}{"Title":"An American Bond?","Date":"31 March 2016","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" Directed by Guy Hamilton, produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli and with screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz, this is the seventh film in 007 franchise and resumes the participation of Sean Connery in the role of the British agent for the last time.

Narrowly escapes death in a crematorium and continues to follow the clues to Las Vegas, where he will face again Blofeld, the mastermind behind the theft of diamonds, with which it plans to build a space satellite that destroy entire cities.Although Sean Connery returned to the role of 007, the film's producers know they will not be forever. On the other hand, the pressure for adapting the character to a new audience increases with the entry in the seventies. Although the plot is almost entirely passed in the United States, the film has almost no action scenes, on the contrary some particular scenes are perfectly anecdotal, in a humorous style that did not benefit the film. On the other hand, it appears to interpret the character Connery no motivation and no concern that shown in previous films into thinking it would have been better to the paper, once and for all, to another actor. The theme of space conquest, which was fashionable during this time, it could also have been better used, as would be in future films.In this film, apart from central casting inherited from previous films, James Bond is incarnated by Sean Connery. Jill St. John gave life to the bond-girl Tiffany Case. Charles Gray played the villain, Blofeld. Putter Smith and Bruce Glover gave life to the double murder, and apparently homosexual, Mr. Kid and Mr. Wint.

The first entry in the series where Bond became completely ridiculous and entered its camp stages that followed through to Roger Moore's seven outings as 007.Bond has been given three years to track Blofeld down after the death of his wife in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Blofeld plans to hold the world to ransom after he constructs a machine made out of diamonds that has the power to destroy an entire continent.Many Bond fans will notice the sudden shift in tone. Where the previous six entries in the franchise took their material fairly seriously Diamonds Are Forever is completely camp in its approach. This will either shock fans or still entertain those that have a real fondness for Bond and Sean Connery.One key example is the secondary villains Mr Wint and Mr Kidd. It is established early on that they are a homosexual couple. It's extremely bizarre and odd for a Bond film that thankfully never comes across as homophobic or insensitive. It only adds a certain strange and peculiar charm to the film that is difficult to explain. Unlike other entries however that were not affected by this problem, Diamonds Are Forever's campness comes at a cost. The girls in the film are merely damsels in distress for the sake of the plot and whenever Bond feels particularly horny. To say that they have little depth would be an understatement as by themselves they barely feel like real characters anyway.Blofeld played by Charles Gray is more laughable than intimidating at any given moment. Most likely due to the fact that Gray starred in You Only Live Twice as an ally for Bond. Therefore it's impossible to shake off this feeling of de ja vu whenever we encounter him. The plot this time around is flat out ridiculous and does not even try to be coherent. Diamonds that have the power to omit a laser by reflecting the sun's heat and thereby destroy the world? No. This is James Bond? No wonder Austin Powers found it so easy to parody the franchise from this point onwards as it had almost became a parody of itself.Though for all its flaws Diamonds Are Forever zips along at a reasonable pace and it's truly wondrous to see Sean Connery in the title role again, even if this outing is one of his weaker films. There are the various stunts to keep action fans happy and enough that is different to ensure that monotony never sets in. In all fairness to Diamonds Are Forever I was never bored or uninterested.Diamonds Are Forever is sure to keep fans of the franchise happy. But whether its outright camp approach will entertain you or leave you bewildered depends entirely on the mind-set of the viewer. After On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever is more of a shrug than the sudden blow to the heart of the former. Still this entry should not be dismissed lightly, particularly if you are in the mood for a fun and breezy Bond adventure. You need look no further.

That said, I thought that his performance was far better than in either Thunderball or You Only Live Twice as he's clearly having a great deal of fun with the part, which I'm sure had something to do with being paid ¬£1.25 million to return to his most famous role. However, I don't think that he was ever able to recapture the spark and commitment to Bond that he displayed in the first three films, particularly Goldfinger (still my absolute favourite). That film's director Guy Hamilton returned to the Bond fold for this film but was similarly unable to recapture the old spark.Jill St. John is good as Tiffany Case and she's clearly having the time of her life starring in a Bond film but it's not a very well written character. She starts off well as an intelligent, resourceful smuggler who seems to be Bond's equal but, over the course of the film, she devolves into a naive and perhaps even stupid character who gives Bond girls a bad name. However, as I said, the problem lies with the script rather than Jill St. John's performance. While Lana Wood may not be the actress than her late sister Natalie Wood was, she's very likable as Plenty O'Toole and, while it was hardly a shock given the series' well- established formula, it was shame that she died as I'd have liked to have seen more of her in the film. (No pun intended!)Charles Gray, who previously played Nikko Henderson in You Only Live Twice, makes for a very good villain but he doesn't make for a very good Blofeld. Again, the problem lies with the script rather than the actor's performance. In You Only Live Twice, Donald Pleasence's Blofeld was a creepy psycho. In On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Telly Savalas' Blofeld was basically a gangster. In this film, Gray's Blofeld is a gentleman villain of the old mould and his characterisation seems the most inconsistent with his previous portrayals. In all honesty though, I thought that Blofeld worked best as the faceless puppet master of From Russia with Love and Thunderball. He didn't appear in the novel on which this is based and I think that the film could have followed suit. It would have allowed Gray to excel as a new character and would have made up for the fact that Tracy's death is never mentioned. Considering the events of the previous film, Bond and Blofeld are amazingly civil during their scenes together! Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell's appearances are briefer than usual on this occasion but they both pick up right where they left off with Sean Connery, particularly the former. The interaction between Bond and M while Sir Donald is briefing them on the diamond situation is a delight. Conversely, Desmond Llewelyn has slightly more screen time as Q than usual and is as excellent as ever in the part. Some of the other casting choices are a little...odd such as Jimmy Dean as the very thinly veiled Howard Hughes parody. Country and western music has never really been my thing so I never heard of Dean until last year when I saw him in an episode of The Patty Duke Show as himself. Well, I think that he should have stuck to playing himself because he's rather poor as Whyte. Norman Burton, who earned himself a place in pop culture history as the first ape seen in Planet of the Apes, is horribly miscast as Felix Leiter. He's usually a good, reliable actor but he plays the role as if he were a rather dimwitted sitcom dad. Jack Lord, he ain't. However, the film does have some very good supporting actors such as Lawrence Naismith, Joseph Furst, perennial film and TV gangster Marc Lawrence, David Bauer, Ed Bishop, Leonard Barr, Sid Haig and David de Keyser. Like Gray, both Bauer and Bishop appeared as different characters in You Only Live Twice.While they're hardly the most politically correct villains to grace the silver screen, I quite liked Bruce Glover - who is Crispin Glover's dad, incidentally - and Putter Smith as Mr Wint and Mr Kidd. At first. I had the same attitude to them as I did to most of the humour in the film in general it started off well and served as a breath of fresh air after the seriousness of On Her Majesty's Secret Service but got very old and went too far over the top as the film progressed such as, uh, Blofeld in drag. In fairness, some of the comic moments were great though. M telling Bond that at least there was one subject that he wasn't an expert in is his funniest moment in seven films and I loved the chase scene with the moon buggy! There were some great one-liners as well but almost all of them were in the first half of the film. It makes me a bit apprehensive of the reliance on comedy during most of the Roger Moore era, if I'm honest.The film doesn't look as good as the previous ones. Blofeld's lair at the top of the Whyte House was the only set which really allowed Ken Adam to work his magic. The bright lights of Las Vegas can't really compare to the beauty of Istanbul, Japan or the Swiss Alps. Vegas lacks the exotic quality that I've come to expect from Bond films. Amsterdam is a beautiful city which makes for an ideal Bond film location but its appearance is too minor to make much of an impact.Overall, this is a decent film and a very good one in its first half. However, it's less than the sum of its parts. I just wish that Sean Connery had been afforded a stronger film to go out on.

(Diamonds Are Forever) is the funniest Bond yet, and originally a comedy more than anything else. I bet it was a vacation for the franchise's team in Las Vegas. So, for anybody loves Bond movies as action / spy thrillers, this could be their most provocative one in the series. And for the rest, it's the relief or the comic episode. As for me, I'm one of the rest because I love it very much. I rank it also as the second sexiest Bond (after Thunderball). Jill St. John &#x96; the first American Bond girl &#x96; was one of the best ever. She's exceptionally sexy. For one reason she can be hot by only a look, and for another reason her manners were a bit outrageous compared to Bond's other girls (she said my behind along with the immortally ambiguous, sort of fun to think about, Blow Up Your Pants !). She was astonishing in that skimpy violet bikini, while (Guy Hamilton)'s naughty, oh too naughty, camera shooting her from the back side in close distances and more than once ! Especially when she was handing over the tape to Connery.. Ahhh that was sexually bold to holy extent. Over and above I'm just crazy about her intro, considering it one of the most breathtaking intros in the history of cinema! (along with Ann-Margaret in Viva Las Vegas, Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot..). This movie is as Jill St. John's loudly colored bikini; campy yet funny and hot. It's one licentious Bond, filled up with just sexual spices and sarcastic joking. They even deleted a Sammy Davis Jr. cameo (maybe to reduce the hilarity of it). The Bond stuff was in the background, since the mission this time got nothing to do with espionage. The climactic sequence seemed like an empty repetition of maybe all the previous climactic sequences with a ticking bomb in a lair, many henchmen running in uniform, Bond trying to flee, with &#x96; always &#x96; a girl in a bikini (or not too much clothes!). This is what I call a boring deja-vu already. But some comedy made it less boring and more entertaining this round. By the way here, and maybe here only, the rocket that Bond wants to, and used to, blow near the end looks like anything but a rocket. Well, strangely this time when it comes to its shape&#x85;Austin Powers was right! And come to think of it; it's the climax of the 60's wicked metaphor that distinguished the whole Bond; beating the evil guy's attempt to penetrate the world, and rape the peace by blowing up his horny.. let's say virility! Then, for more teasing, winning the girl ! And if you have doubts just remember that (Shirley Bassey) fainted when she knew how the movie's remarkable theme song was a figurative expression about penis (it's true story, I did my researches well on that !). (Connery) was weary; looking tired to be Bond, or trying his best to look tired to be Bond! He clearly did it for the money, but unlike (Never Say Never Again) he seems this time really uninterested (or uninteresting !). If you want to sum up this movie then think  Jill St. John walking in front of the camera in only a panty and bra, Lana Wood as (Plenty O'Toole) going in front of the camera in only a panty!, 2 astonishing chicks trying to kill Bond in their bikinis (Oh Yeah!), 2 more violent men assassins yet loving each other gaily (!), Bond landing on a toilet seat, Q playing Las Vegas games, and Ernst Stavro Blofeld himself dressed as a woman and talking about nice cheeks !! As you see it is a gay party. Sometimes too gay to be a spoof of itself, or simply the most comic Bond. A colorful time both ways.

OOMSS may have received mixed reviews but it was clear that Lazonby as Bond was completely lacklustre and it wasn't surprising that he only made one appearance as the super spy while Blofield may been played by different actors such as Donald Pleasance, Telly Savalas and this time, Charles Gray in this 1971 release. Diamonds are Forever is a highly watchable film because there are some excellent choice of locations and my favourite is Las Vegas and the Neveda desert and there is generally good levels of action and the car chases along with the humour and dialogue that adds up. But the film is not without its drawbacks by being a bit dated and it is sometimes lacking the qualities of earlier Connery-era Bond films, being more violent and also a little bit dreary and has also been hampered by production problems. Finally, compared to today's Las Vegas, its hard to imagine what it was like back in 1971 with all those frequent changes that have taken place over the years making it virtually unrecognisable.

Especially when the ray heats up---and blows up--an entire anti-aircraft missile emplacement. Well, instead of electromagnetic pulse like Goldeneye---it is heat in Diamonds Are Forever that is used in the weapon's destructive force.All of that leads into the final battle at an oil rig which masks as a main computer base, housing the main control area for that haywire space weapon. Well, Bond stops the main evil character by hoisting up his escape ship and slamming it into the main control area, knocking the computer out of commission. The laser weapon was supposed to attack Washington D.C. but the failure of the master control put the whole evil contraption out of commission. I especially like the mini-fight scene involving two accomplices of the main evil character that were about to kill Bond and his lady companion with a dynamite bomb rigged on a timer. Of course, when Bond fights back by putting that bomb on the back of one of the bad men and throwing him overboard just in time (the bomb blows just before he hits the water)---you know that Bond is going to live another day.

I used to watch it when it was on TV in the eighties (when I was a child) and I loved it. Nowadays, I guess I can see where people are coming from. It is a bit of an odd-one-out among the franchise.Sean Connery returns as Bond (after the unsuccessful George Lazenby took over the titular role for a single outing). Now he's older. And it shows. Plus it doesn't really carry on from On Her Majesty's Secret Service; it feels like it's more a continuation of Connery's last Bond film, You Only Live Twice. Also, due to Lazenby's Bond not being financially profitable in American, Diamonds Are Forever is conveniently sent almost completely in the USA (including the first ever American Bond girl). Also, to add a few more pennies to the film's takings, we have plenty of product placement throughout. Therefore, Diamonds Are Forever seems to have its share of oddities before you even get to the plot.Bond chases diamonds to America and ends up getting tangled up with his arch enemy Blofeld (again). There's not much to the story, but that doesn't matter too much as it flows along nicely. However, one criticism that was always applied to Roger Moore's Bond films was that they couldn't be taken seriously. People seem to prefer Connery's more serious outings. However, almost every line has a - naughty - double meaning to it and some of the situations do border on the comical.Then, just when you think you're in a smutty comedy, you have two of the creepiest hit men ever seen on screen thrown in there. By today's standards, they're not too politically-correct. But whether it was then or now, they still seem to have been airdropped in from a much darker story.Diamonds Are Forever is a mixed bag. Most serious Bond fans will hate it. I only like it because I remember it from my childhood and I never really got all the plot holes and silliness that came with it.Don't hate it too much. It's not that bad, but it certainly is the 'odd Bond out' from Connery's time as the secret agent. You may only watch it once, but if you like Roger Moore's 'lighter' Bond, you may get some enjoyment out of this.

A fun film that is also slightly funny at times and I felt it was strongly a kind of good film and here below is why I felt that about Diamonds Are Forever.The story is fun and set mostly in the USA and when he is Las Vegas it works really well as Bond get's to show off his charm even more among the numerous bars and casino's there. I like the pace as it is slightly slower than Connery's previous outings but still churns out a good story and great villains all who make the film even more fun. I also loved the stunts as they are ridiculous but they also work with this film and make it much more fun and exciting to watch.Connery is back and his job in this is a firm one albeit he is very old I this to portray the kind of Bond he is trying to show. The Bond girl is Jill St. John and she is probably the most feisty Bond girl there is and seems to object to everything Bond does in the film. I loved the villains and not Just Blofeld(Charles Gray) but also Wint and Mr Kidd who play two of the most villainous Bond villains ever and are possibly the most calm yet sadistic movie villains in any film ever.The script and direction are average and to be fair are the same typical type of things we expect to see from Bond in his earlier showings. I loved the action sequences and well although Bond may take a slight back seat with the action he still manages to get in some great stunts and some good fight sequences that are we choreographed. One stunt you will see, I won't give it away, but it involves a car and Bond makes it do a certain thing which is well, well it must be near impossible but you will see.The movie can be slow at times and you can even feel it is becoming stale at parts but it manages to hold up enough not too. I said before he sits back on the action and he does very much so, maybe Connery didn't want as much action as he was older but he seems to get by with little action, although I did feel it did well even without the bags of action we usually see. Another criticism would be the apparent Homophobia in where the villains are seen as a Homosexual couple and it is sometimes thought that because of there sexuality they are evil, it is never confirmed and should do little to offend.Any Bond fan should like this as it show's off exactly what I feel Bond is known for, but also show's a more reserved Bond who studies the situation much better than in every other film. If you like a good crime spy adventure then this if or you too, it had gadgets, action and the fun criminals involved too, most should enjoy this as it can be very rewarding and fun.I give it a 7/10 meaning a strongly a kind of good film, I felt maybe I overrated it after but hey it is a fun film and can be thoroughly enjoyed as well. When you watch just don't think about the plot and enjoy the quick snappy humour of Connery in his last Eon produced Bond role, in the truth the end of one of the best Bond's, and many consider him the best of all of them.

I don't necessarily hate this movie, and I don't believe it's the worst Connery 007 movie in the series. That said, it's still an incredibly weak entry and a low note for Sean Connery's end to his official series run. After George Lazenby and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE didn't perform as well as the studio had hoped (though it was still a success), their mission became to replicate the massive success of GOLDFINGER through any means necessary. All the signs are there Sean Connery in the title role, Shirley Bassey performing the main theme, James Bond returning to America to unravel a complex bit of villainy, and a more toned down film that discards a lot (but not all) of the over-the-top elements of the previous films. The result is a tonally dull and overly complex that, while mildly entertaining at times, is pretty unmemorable. Following the events of the previous film, 007 concludes his worldwide manhunt for SPECTRE leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld when he confronts him and apparently kills him in a plastic surgery facility. From there, he is called in to investigate a diamond smuggling ring out of South Africa in which the diamonds have never resurfaced. When people in the smuggling chain start turning up dead, Bond finds a point of contact in Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) and poses as a smuggler to infiltrate the organization.In a sense, it was good to have Connery back in the title role. But any good will the movie has from that is soon dissolved once we get into the movie itself. From the very beginning, I felt we were off on the wrong foot when it's revealed that Charles Gray has stepped into the shoes of iconic villain Blofeld. I don't have anything against Gray (though the only other time I've seen him on film was as the short-lived MI6 contact Henderson in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) but he doesn't fit the Blofeld mold. The series had gone through a few Blofelds at this point and I'd always wished they'd chosen one actor (preferably Donald Pleasance) and run with him. So, a new Blofeld and it's Charles Gray. It didn't work for me but it could've been forgiven if the rest of the movie wasn't so flawed. Let's move on to Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. Bizarre as they were, my major complaint with them had to be the fact that Putter Smith (Mr. Kidd) can't act. This is because he's not an actor. It shows. His line delivery is awkward and lifeless, and it ruins any potential creepiness coming from Bruce Glover's Mr. Wint. Let's shift to some positive casting the Bond women in this movie are some of the hottest. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are both gorgeous and, while Plenty O'Toole (Wood) is sort of annoying, Tiffany Case (St. John) could be considered one of the stronger Bond women of the earlier films. She's tough and independent, even if she doesn't know her associates well enough to know if she should truly trust them.Oh, one more bit of bad casting Jimmy Dean, country star/sausage guru, as business mogul Willard Whyte. Yup.Now, I am happy that the movie attempted to tone down a lot of the over-the-top campiness of some of the more recent fare. No orbital space capsule hijackings, no phony rear projection bobsled chases, etc. The bulk of this movie handles itself with some class. Until the moon buggy chase. At one point, Bond is escaping from an industrial complex where they're filming some sort of moon landing and Bond commandeers the goofiest looking moon buggy you'll ever see, drives it through a wall, and goes bouncing off through the Nevada desert pursued by guards on strange little motor tricycles with balloon tires. As Bond careens around the desert a medium speeds, cars and motor tricycles go barreling out of control and launch off sand dunes by the guards who've apparently never operated a motor vehicle. I'm sorry, but this sequence (when combined with Wint and Kidd&#x85;mostly Kidd) ruins any credibility the movie hoped to maintain. It doesn't do the movie any favors that the plot comes across as way more complex than necessary. Around the midpoint of the film, I totally lose track of who has the diamonds and where they're going and I don't regain my bearings until Bond busts into Whyte's top-floor penthouse.DIAMONDS ARE FORVER isn't the worst 007 film but it's far from one of the best. It's decent entertainment at times but there's nothing here (aside from the moon buggy chase) that remained with me after the final credits rolled when I first saw the movie years ago. The entire final act, with an assault on an oil rig, is a dud. I'd completely forgotten all about it until I rewatched the film again not long ago. As the seventh film in the series, it gives the impression that the series began to lose some steam and the 007 hit machine might not be as invulnerable as it once seemed.

Whereas You Only Live Twice was the usual daft and deft mix of humour and action in a nonsensical plot, Diamonds Are Forever had deft action in a nonsensical and messy plot with a touch of tired and camp cynicism.Bond is enrolled by the British government to find who is cornering the world's diamond-smuggling market and put a stop to it. It's an un-engaging battle for the viewer though, Stout Bond looks for the most part uninterested in putting in the actual work for the money for which he was enticed back. There's also probably the worst scene in any of his Bond films when he's escaping from Tectronics in a Moon buggy &#x96; to someone brought up on Banana Splits it's awful and almost slapstick. The portrayal of younger women purely as sex objects is even more pronounced than before&#x85;although I confess I personally I preferred to look at Jill St. John than Connery throughout. On the plus side Bond's punch up with the real Franks in the lift was exciting, the car chase through Las Vegas was amusing, and Bond getting hot under the collar in the funeral parlour was chilling &#x96; there's plenty to savour, although Plenty wasn't in it for long. God help us if the world's safety depended on the quality of cassette tape playback!Overall it's not as witty or memorable as we'd grown accustomed to, but watchable probably even for a non-completist. The next film in the series continued as The Saint, but to this day I still think the unshaken and unstirred Connery would have made a better Bond in the '70's, especially if he could've lost a lot of pounds and got a better wig. Never mind, there are the 6 movies of varying excellence and consistent entertainment from 1962-1971 to revel in every few years.

Sean Connery got lots of extra money to come back for one more round, but less physical strain than most of the earlier efforts.With the recent death of 82 year old Jimmy Dean (Willard Whyte), we must be reminded that Sean Connery is 80, Jill St John looks plenty cheeky in this one is 70, and Lana Wood is 64 as I write this. When you watch this movie, it doesn't seem possible. Still this is a good film to watch. This is a very rare movie role for Dean, as most of his work was recording (Big Bad John) & TV's The Jimmy Dean Show. Dean's character is kind of a ruse looking to be the bad guy.This film features all the regulars from the series for Connery's last trip with them. Then there are things like a bit part for Leonard Barr, & the first apparently gay bad guys trying to do in Bond. Then besides the 2 hot main Bond women, we have Bambi & Thumper, a couple of exercises for Connery.Blofeld (Charles Gray in this one) has taken over millionaire Willard Whytes empire by kidnapping him & then using a voice mocking tool to run his empire. He sets up some new parts of the Empire involved in stealing Diamonds which he places into a satellite to put into orbit. This is where he is using solar energy to heat up the glass to create a super weapon energy beam with a purpose of destroying parts of the earth.This film has quite a bit of old Las Vegas in it, & there is a touch of nostalgia here as the good guys & bad guys seem well defined. The big clue to a lot of this has to do with cheap cologne. This film's added humor along with Connery is welcome relief after the previous film & actually paves the road well to lead into Roger Moore's more humorous Bond films to follow.

A perfectly done title sequence goes quite well with a great title song, before we get down to business an initially literal adaptation of Fleming's novel, as Wint and Kidd smuggle diamonds out of Africa, after brutally killing the courier, and the deliverer. Bond, none too enthused about being assigned to what he calls a relatively simple smuggling matter, is sent to intercept the next link, a professional smuggler called Peter Franks, in Amsterdam. Bond, after rendezvousing with yet another smuggler (gorgeous Jill St. John) ends up beating Franks' ass in close-quarters-combat in a lift, in another highlight of this movie.Unfortunately, after the exciting and well done first forty minutes, leading this Bond fan to think I'm about to watch potentially one of the best Bonds, the screenplay degenerates into a seemingly never-ending series of gags and pratfalls and silly vignettes. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are both gorgeous, but Jill loses interest halfway through the movie and becomes a bumbling nitwit, and Lana Wood has only a cameo, played strictly for laughs. Throw in a Bullitt-inspired car chase through the Las Vegas Strip, a faked moon landing, a Howard Hughes clone Willard Whyte, and some type of diamond powered space laser(?) and that makes up the majority of the second half.Bond, after violently fending off the attacks of several armed guards in the pre-title sequence, and the aforementioned fight in the lift, basically has his ass handed to him by a pair of female gymnasts, in what will forever be remembered as one of the dumbest and most inane scenes in any Bond film.Charles Grey is a wonderful actor, and I do wish they had used more of him in the Bond series, but he was a terrible Blofeld, too nice of a guy to be an international terrorist set on killing Bond, and they've turned Blofeld into a cross dressing terrorist with a cat fetish? Connery's weight was obviously up and down during filming; as he is briefed by M., it looks like he needed a crowbar to fit into his suit. Likewise, by the poolside, with the body floating in it. Those thick, bushy grey sideburns only made Connery look older. Indeed, he turned 40 years old during filming, but he looked closer to 60.The ending is anticlimactic; the fight in the lift was more exciting.Overall, the film is enjoyable for its first third, then in a surreal way for its final two thirds, but I wish they had followed the plot of Ian Fleming's original novel more closely. That would have made the film consistently good. Or at least, not as uneven as it is now. Filming wrapped in September 1971, and it was released to cinemas in December of 1971; its rushed post production undoubtedly contributed to its randomness.

Despite Richard Maibaum's literate script (the last to truly 'follow' a Fleming novel), first-time director Peter Hunt's remarkable 'vision', and a performance by novice actor George Lazenby that wasn't nearly as bad as some reviewers at the time would claim, OHMSS was spurned by many Bond fans, and had some critics proclaiming Tracy Was Killed, but Bond Is Dead.While American actor John Gavin had already signed on to make DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (George Lazenby's inflated ego had gotten the better of him, and he'd managed to get himself 'fired'), Broccoli decided that the franchise needed a major overhaul. Gavin was dropped, Peter Hunt was dropped, and Richard Maibaum's revenge-driven Bond script was rewritten by Tom Mankiewicz into a light-hearted, witty spoof of the earlier 007 films, ignoring his wife's death, and concentrating on gadgets, sex, and superhuman heroics. Veteran director Guy Hamilton, who had guided GOLDFINGER, everyone's favorite Bond movie, was brought back to direct the project...and Broccoli, bowing to pressure from the 007 audience, approached Sean Connery to take the role, one more time.Connery, who had already made four films since his last Bond outing, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, hated Broccoli (feeling the producer had 'robbed' him of his share of the profits for the first two Bond films), and loved the leverage he now possessed. When asked about the size of his paycheck to resume the role, he joked, I always wanted to own a golf course and a bank...I already own a golf course... He also stipulated a hefty fee for each day the production ran over schedule (Lest he seem TOO greedy, much of his salary went to Scottish charities). As a final insult, the actor refused to get into shape for filming, appearing paunchier and grayer than ever (making Broccoli so irate that when he hired Roger Moore for the follow-up, LIVE AND LET DIE, he ordered him, immediately, to lose weight and get a haircut!)Broccoli's instincts proved correct, as the comedy-oriented DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER would become one of 1971's biggest hits. Connery tossed off one-liners with ease, Jill St. John 'channeled' Lucille Ball in her performance as klutzy 'Tiffany Case', and Charles Gray would be sexually ambiguous rather than threatening as Ernst Stavro Blofeld. (His two henchmen would be gay, as well, and so caricatured that the homosexual community would protest the film). Loaded with car chases, fistfights, explosions, and gadgets, Bond 'purists' were appalled by the end product, but a successful new 'formula' had been created, one that would serve Roger Moore very well during his long tenure as 007.And Sean Connery could buy his bank...

What made him to do the unofficial Never say never again 12 years later is a whole another story and I don't want to hear it.George Lazenby's notorious performance in the role of James Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service was somewhat disappointing although the film was actually rather good and the bloke tried as hard as he could. Nevertheless the fact that the phenomenally charismatic Connery came back to show the moviegoers who's the one and only real Bond was more than pleasing.

The 60s were dead and the Bond franchise had to update fast to remain in step with society.In all of the 60s Bond flicks there's a distinct element of darkness below the surface of quip dialogue, fast cars, gadgets and pretty bikinied bodies. Diamonds set out to entertain in a light and fluffy yet more risque manner than any of the previous Bond films. Sean Connery left the Bond franchise behind in 1967 to pursue a serious acting career. But when Australia's own George Lasenbury decided not to do another Bond film after &#145;On Her Majesty's Secret Service' (big, big mistake on George's part) Sean had to be brought back in to save the production of Diamonds.Throughout the film, Sean wears a sardonic smile. His whole demeanor says &#145;Look, I'm only back because I'm being paid a million dollars'. Frankly, this works on screen very well. Sean looks older, rougher, more world weary and ready to take the role with a good pinch of salt.Jill St John makes for a fantastic heroin. She plays a vastly different leading lady role to the Bond chicks of the 60s. She's a smart alec, wise cracking, hard nosed so and so. Her relationship with Sean is great &#150; more brother/sister than romantic.

It's no 1960s Connery film (the lead actor's older), nor a 1970s Moore outing (more serious). This movie is sandwiched between the two eras, and it rightly should be taken on its own terms.

This leads him to a sinister weapon being manufactured in space that can destroy major cities, the architect of such vileness? SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the man who murdered Bond's wife and someone Bond thought he had already located and killed.With George Lazenby withdrawing from the franchise after just the one film, off to massage his ego and take further bad advice from those around him, Albert R. Broccoli & Harry Saltzman set about making Bond sustainable box office in the 1970s. American actor John Gavin (Psycho/Spartacus) had signed on to fill the tuxedo, but armed with wads of cash the producers managed to entice Connery back to the role he had previously fell out of love with. Helped, too, that Connery's post Bond movies, his last outing had been You Only Live Twice in 1967, had hardly set the box office alight. It seemed a long shot, but Connery stunned the movie world by agreeing to once again play the role that many would come to know him for.Back came Connery, back came director Guy Hamilton and back came Shirley Bassey to sing the title song (a true Bond classic it proved to be as well), these were reassuring signs, as was having Blofeld remain on villain duties. However, stung by the criticism of Lazenby's humanesque On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the drop in box office profits compared to Connery's latter Bond films, the makers decided to play this Bond as fantastique, something that would define Bond until Timothy Dalton tried something different at the end of the 1980s. Roger Moore would replace Connery as Bond two years later and it's widely thought that his arrival as 007 ushered in the ridiculous era of overt humour, preposterous sight gags and cartoonish escapades, not so, it began with Connery's Diamonds Are Forever. The moment Bond drives a Ford Mustang on two wheels, all bets were off in the franchise.Artistically Diamonds is a disappointing movie, fun for sure, but the screenplay refuses to let the film take itself seriously. It's often camp and the picture lacks dramatic thrust and spectacular action, with the finale a rather tepid affair. Connery's presence gives the film some warmth, but his charisma and vocal delivery can't detract from the fact he looks to be doing it purely for the money. His weight, like his hair colour, fluctuates, and much of the vibrancy of his 60s Bond portrayals had disappeared. Charles Gray turns in the worst Blofeld of them all, saddled with a screenplay that has him cloning and cross dressing, Gray has Blofeld as charming and wry, gone is the menace and machismo so wonderfully portrayed by Pleasence and Savalas respectively in the previous two Bond movies. Felix Leiter in Norman Burton's hands has been reduced to being a bit of a doofus, the baddies are either too fey or over the top, while Jill St John's main Bond girl, Tiffany Case, descends from being a steely femme at the beginning, to a voluptuous caricature.On the plus side. Barry's score and Ken Adam's sets are still franchise joys, the byplay between Bond and M (Bernard Lee again) reminds us of once great characterisations, while Desmond Llewelyn's Q is nicely sent out in the field for a change. Action wise there's some fine moments. The pre-credits sequence as Bond chases down Blofeld starts things off excitingly, a fight in a lift is up with the best of the Bond movie dust-ups and the dirt bike and Mustang chase sequences are well put together by Hamilton. Good gadgets, too, if you like that side of Bond? There was enough good parts here, and the return of Connery, to ensure Diamonds Are Forever was a monster success at the box office, where it grossed over $115 million worldwide. It proved that Bond had longevity, but with a new actor to come to the Bond role in two years time and the big shift to comedy action over tough guy missions, would Bond turn off the movie loving public? 6/10 "},{"Title":"This was the best James Bond movie ever","Date":"24 May 2007","Score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" Yes he was new, yes there were a few mistakes in the movie but he was a wonderful actor as well as a sweet person that I had the pleasure of meeting during the filming of this movie, I think he got better with time, me and my sister were both extras in this movie Diamonds are Forever we are easy to spot, in the Las Vegas scene, Circus Circus Casino, you'll see us 2 African American kids just happy to be there.

He is joined by a plethora of over-acting actors playing moronic characters chief amongst them are Jill St John, who easily wins the medal of most annoying Bond girl of all time; Jimmy Dean, who's boneheaded Texan drawl adds more than a few eye-rolls to the movie.The film is also burdened with one of the most convoluted plots of all Bond films, which is very odd considering how cartoonish the whole setup is. Some good special effects just cannot compensate for all the inane hijacks that accompany them.I have to say this right now, and that is I love James Bond and everything about him, but this film is so embarrassingly bad, I don;t even consider it Bond canon.

However, things aren't of a diamond-like quality as the producers had hoped for with Connery on board...Diamonds are Forever is an absolute trainwreck of epic proportions. This is mainly due to the fact that it isn't the revenge story it should have been and Lazenby should be here, not Connery. Connery's return is simply disappointing. He looks like he aged about 20 years since You Only Live Twice and seemed bored and uninterested and was only there for the money, having been paid a million, the highest paid salary at that time. Furthermore, after a promising start in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, it's simply tragic that Lazenby (and Savalas and Hunt) didn't come back for a second film as he had the potential to be better than Connery if he'd stuck around for more, plus getting closure for the events in the previous film.While more or less every other Bond film has some energy to it and the cast and crew put in a considerable effort, everything about the film in general is just so goddamn lazy. After the critical aftermath of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the producers decided to play it safe and pretend that the 1969 film didn't exist and generally play it for laughs. With everything that is wrong with this film, the very fact that it wasn't the revenge story it should have been or at least some revenge angle, the film really doesn't deserve to see the light of day in my opinion.And let's not forget the villains. Firstly, Gray's Blofeld is such a unsinister villain that you don't care whether or not his plan actually succeeds or not. Secondly, Wint and Kidd's homosexuality in the novel was only hinted at and both characters were serious hit men, but here their homosexuality is grossly exaggerated (in comparison to the book) and nothing like their literature counterparts.The film only follows the book in certain areas, like the meeting in the apartment but is much, much sillier. It would be interesting to see the Spang brothers in a proper adaptation of the novel (of course, with much bigger roles, the Spang brothers are hardly in the novel), plus involving the section concerning the race track. Furthermore, in the novel, Tiffany Case is a frosty well-developed character and *not* the dumb bimbo of the film. Take this piece of dialogue for example'Listen, Bond,' said Tiffany Case. 'It'd take more than Crabmeat Ravigotte to get me into bed with a man. In any event, since it's your check, I'm going to have caviar, and what the English call cutlets, and some pink champagne. I don't often date a good-looking Englishman and the dinner's going to live up to the occasion.'Now, would you find the Tiffany Case of the film say this? The book is one of my favourites in the series but not properly adapting the book is the least of this film's problems.On the plus side, the film does feature a fantastic song by Shirley Bassey, the film's only redeemable quality.

The movie just turned into a more subdued Thunderball, with Blofeld blackmailing the world with the threat of destroying it.

Jill St. John, as Tiffany Case, consoles Sean Connery's James Bond midway through DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. One would have wonder exactly WHICH fulsome friend Ms. St. John is lamenting. Two of the likely candidates are Marie and Plenty. Neither character is on-screen long enough to even qualify for MLB's proverbial cup of coffee. Bond rips off Marie's bikini top and garrotes her with it. Since the uncredited Denise Perrier, who played Marie, was not as famous as Ms. St. John, her chest points are clearly visible during this violent episode (144) and NOT modestly covered by pasties, as is the case when Bond beds Tiffany (10830). This psychopathic sex-killing set-up (even if not carried to an ultimate conclusion) clearly inspired director Alfred Hitchcock's only topless scene the following year in FRENZY. (As a fellow Brit, Hitchcock was insanely jealous of Bond's glory and box office, churning out pale imitations such as TOPAZ and TORN CURTAIN in his declining years.) On the other hand, actress Lana Wood, as DIAMONDS' Plenty O'Toole, suffers from benign neglect. Miss O'Toole spends plenty of her brief on-screen time during this film in swimming pools, being doubled by stunt-women and\or dummies. While Plenty may be more fulsome than Marie, neither woman is likely to keep Tiffany awake at night. Perhaps a more intriguing point to note is that DIAMONDS' final Bond triumph just before the end credits depends on its audience accepting as fact that gays know nothing about wine!

Diamonds Are Forever, though, has not only some scenes of very dark humor (for example when Plenty is thrown out of the window - and the killer apologises for her safe landing with the words I didn't know there was a pool down there), but regrettably also a few others that border on the tasteless. I am thinking of the way Bond disposes of the 2 killers on the cruise ship, or when he happily says he sincerely hopes Franks is dead - in these scenes, the audience gets the impression he actually enjoys killing people in interesting, painful ways which is a long way from the old-school type of hero that would kill only for self-defense or if it really can't be avoided. From the fantasy in Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice, we are down to earth here which also shows in the locations that are not exotic, but plainly continental Europe (Amsterdam) and the USA. There even is a car chase scene which would fit into anything from Smokey And the Bandit to Kojak, but for Bond it's below standard to trash a few cars. What I liked best the escape with the moon car is funny and unusual, the 2 athletic ladies kicking Bond where it hurts were a novelty, and I liked Charles Gray as a villain with a good reason to attack Washington DC (If we destroy Kansas, the world may not hear about it for years). Instead of a little known Bond girl whose participation in a Bond is the only highlight of her career, this time we get to see an actress already known for her other movies Jill St.John was a great choice for the part of Tiffany Case. Not one of the top 10 Bond movies, but Diamonds Are Forever still has a handful of good moments.

The only real memorable sequence from this film is a car chase through Las Vegas, with an unforgivable turn for a car in a narrow alley, which needs to be seen to be believed how bad it looks.Jill St.John plays a good character in Tiffany Case, but does not play Tiffany Case as a good Bond Girl. Her and Bond don't spend enough time together to create that romantic link between the two. She feels more like an allie to Bond rather than his love interest. Jimmy Dean was also perfectly cast as Willard Whyte. He really came across as a high profiled American who likes things to go his way. As the films have gone on, the great character has seemed to decrease in Ernst Blofeld. This time we have the wonderful Charles Gray portraying him, but his talent is put to waste. He should have be on screen more with a menacing tone, instead of dressing up in drag to capture the Bond girl.John Barrys greatness when it comes to soundtracks also seems to be lacking in this addition.

Connery does take the role better in this film than in the previous appearance, but maybe it is because he knew that it would be his last one, and that they already had some options in the winds.The film opens immediately after On Her Majesty's Secret Service, where Bond is hunting Blofeld after the murder of his wife, shortly after they were married. He finally catches up with Blofeld, but it was disappointing that the bald headed guy that had appeared in the last two movies had been replaced with a grey haired guy. The suggestion is that Blofeld has had plastic surgery to change his appearance, however it is clear that Bond does recognise him. Personally I was disappointed that they had changed Blofeld's character, and the movie definitely loses points for that.However, this is still one of my favourites, and most memorable, films. The bulk of the action takes place in Las Vegas where Bond is on the trail of a diamond smuggling cartel. It seems that Spectre has pretty much been defeated, and this is Blofeld's last attempt at world domination. However, we do not realise that Blofeld is actually involved until most of the way through the movie, as the organisation is some shadowy group that appears to be connected with the mob.Two of the main antagonists are interesting, yet they are also incredibly brutal. In the book they were the antagonists, and Blofeld seemed to have been added simply as an after thought.

Diamonds Are Forever is a more comic, cheesy film, with emphasis on silly comedy and moments like Bond fighting two women called Bambi and Thumper and the portrayed of two flamboyant henchmen. Even the Bond girl, Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) starts off as a competent woman to becoming a ditzy idiot it is a drastic character change. This was mainly because audiences at the time did not response well to a darker, more serious and sombre Bond that George Lazenby portrayed in On Her Majesty's Secret Service and it is only until Casino Royale that audiences have accepted a darker, grittier Bond.Besides from Connery is has always been excellent as Bond, most of the cast were bad. Gray was okay as Blofeld, but he did not have the presence of Donald Pleasance or menace of Telly Savalas. Accept for the rest of the Bond regulars the cast was bad, St. John was a very bad actress, so was Lana Wood and Norman Burton was the worst actor to play Felix Leiter.In terms of scale this Bond film is lacking; much of the action takes place in Las Vegas, limiting the scale non feel s very exotic and limiting the scope. The Las Vegas setting was basically an attempt to make the series appeal more to American audiences.As a direct follow up to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever is a disappointment for discarding the revenge storyline and focusing on a lighter story. But as a standalone Diamonds Are Forever is decent. It is better then other films in the series like Moonraker, The Man With the Golden Gun and Die Another Day. It's enjoyable enough, but not the most memorial film of the series.

Indeed, it's about the only one of his first six Bond parts you can visualise Roger eyebrows Moore in, as he gets little to do other than make smart one-liners, bed the female talent and man the afore-mentioned contraptions. He just about pulls it off, but you can see him going through the motions at times.The movie's outlook towards women too, like Bond's, is anachronistic, I'm struggling to remember a scene where a woman is fully dressed, plus some of Bond's chauvinistic quips I'm plenty...But of course you are seem more at home in a Carry On film. The plotting also seems too similar to say, You Only Live Twice, plus I also think the Mr Kidd & Mr Wint characters would have worked better without their campish gay overtones.On the plus side though, Jill St John gives her cardboard character some presence, Charles Gray is an effective Blofeld (in triplicate), I enjoyed Jimmy Dean's take on Howard Hughes a la Willard Whyte, the Vegas locations are great, John Barry's music adds lustre (ouch!) and, I've got to confess, some of the big scenes still entertain, from the great fight in the confined space of a lift compartment, to the moon buggy escape, naturally the car park chase in downtown Las Vegas with THAT two-wheeled side-on stunt, the fight with Thumper and Bambi and the reckoning with Kidd & Wint as a postscript.I enjoyed the movie but fear that nostalgia was clouding my critical faculties throughout, however as so many have done before, perhaps best to surrender to Bond and go with the flow.

Because Connery is an actor who's improved as an actor the older he gets he still has a great deal of gravitas in his final official Bond-outing, unlike his follower Roger Moore.The film's plot is intriguing and fairly well written. The narrative moves at a nice pace. Action and dialogue are used in even intervals to make the movie flow naturally. The comedy is also not as cheesy as in most Bond films but it's really up to the viewer what sort of attitude they take to the film's comedic and gag moments. From a production side of things the film is quite excellent. Unfortunately the film has very much settled into a traditional James Bong-formula. The structure is rather predictable even if the variety of action keeps the film from becoming boring. Overall the film fails to achieve a serious tone and more or less caters to the needs of the early 70s Bond audiences which unfortunately means the plot loses any sort of serious weight.However, despite its predictability, Diamonds are Forever is a fun and even a slightly self-parodying experience and definitely an entertaining movie.

Its actually frightening to see how much he has aged in almost ten years and not in a good way. Not that the great man would give a stuff considering the fortune he made on this flick. Still, hes better on an off day as Bond than Lazenby firing on all cylinders.This was the 007 that also had a great pair of Homosexual killers Mr Wint and Mr Kidd. Having them murder and spout one liners all through the film is one of DAF's highlights. However, the casting of Charles Gray as Blofeld (WITH HAIR) is crap. And just what was it with those Carmel coloured Tunics that he wore? They look silly. Jill st John as Tiffany Case just plain irritated me throughout. Terrible temper indeed.

Diamonds, however, came out when I was well into my late teens and somewhat more sophisticated. It dawned on me that the Bond films were not really about violence and adventure but....comedy. And it became more comic when Roger Moore took over the role.I remember Robert Vaughn saying when he was asked if he were worried that his Man from Uncle TV series, hugely popular among adolescents in the 60s, would influence them to becoming violent. Vaughn astutely replied that kids understand that the show was to be taken as seriously as Donald Duck cartoons.And that is how I remember Diamonds. Up to now I find myself amused when I recall the scene (SPOILER) near the end of the film when villain Blofeld's two bumbling goons tried to give Bond and his girl a payback for messing up their boss's plans. Bond and his lady (Jill St. John) were enjoying themselves on a cruise ship being served a luscious meal by the two goons disguised as waiters. And the piece d'resistance was Bombe' Surprise. And when Bond asked what was in the Bombe'. The waiter replied that it was a surprise (pronounced in the French fashion). There literally was a bomb in in the Bombe'.The scene brought back another rib-tickling incident about another bomb disguised as food which I read about in The Manila Times back in the early '60s. A small town provincial mayor was staying in a third rate hotel in Manila during the Christmas season. He received a gift box which seemed to him odd as nobody was supposed to know where he was. . He called the police. Inside the box was a tin globe with the markings of a popular brand of Dutch Edam cheese popularly known as Queso de Bola (ball cheese). The Manila Times reporter quipped that it turned out to be a Queso de Bomba because there really was a bomb inside the tin. The idea of Edam ball cheese as a weapon is not really novel as I remember reading about a battle between the English and the Spanish during the age of cannonballs when the English, running out of cannonballs, used baby Edams as shot. They won.

Obviously, the James Bond that Sean portrays is carrying on from where he left off with his portrayal in 'You Only Live Twice' in 1967 and he isn't as melodramatic as would be expected from the events of the previous Bond movie, 'OHMSS'. We are treated to a great car chase in Las Vegas with James getting on the wrong side of American law and order, if you can call it that.Charles Gray turns in a slightly comic portrayal as Blofeld, but is still quite believable as a modern day villain who doesn't care about the disaster he has caused in the life of James Bond, he certainly wants to create more havoc with his attempts at world domination. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are as sexy as ever with the addition of two 'heavy' Bond girls-'Bambi' and 'Thumper'.

I've never been compelled before, but thought I'd register my disgust with this Bond title.I am a huge Bond fan. Grew up watching them and always find time to re-watch, especially when the latest flick hits the theatres. When I judge a Bond film, there are certain criteria I use to assess. Vehicles, gadgets, villains, girls, comedy, locations, plot, Bond himself and the direction to name a few.Diamonds Are Forever fails on almost everyone of these. The lack of vehicles and gadgets gets to me, but the casting for Blofeld was terrible. For starters, he's not bald, he's not menacing and he's just weak all round. When Sean Connery quit the role after You Only Live Twice, who would have thought we would have seen him back? I, personally liked George Lazenby's performance as Bond and enjoyed OHMSS. But this film was just one too many for Connery, and for me, ruined his legacy somewhat. It only cost the producers a whopping $1.25m for his services. He failed to live up to expectations.Guy Hamilton took the directors chair following; possibly the best Bond film ever in Goldfinger, his work here was awful. The fight scenes looked lazy and the acting was bad. How can Bond, looking for revenge for his wife's murder be so civil with Blofeld following OHMSS? The film started like a revenge mission but then things got friendly.The henchmen Mr Kidd & Mr Wint are by far the worse villains ever on a Bond film and again, the acting is appalling.The plot isn't even interesting. How many more times can Blofeld hold the world ransom? This time, he's doing it with the aid of a diamond-encrusted laser satellite. Considering this is the last time we see Blofeld, there was no explanation or closure to this character. We even get to see the super-villain and mysterious SPECTRE leader in drag. (Shocking) The whole film skimps on action.There are a few saving graces to this film. The locations of Amsterdam and Las Vegas gets the thumb up. The performance of Jimmy Dean as reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte was surprisingly a good casting job. (The only one) The pre-credit scene was good and should have continued in this vein. I score this movie 3 out of 10. It's the worse Bond film by far. Connery should have never come back. Maybe on my next re-watch, I'll skip straight to the Roger Moore legacy.

Since Goldfinger, it has been average Bond movie after average Bond movie. The tongue and cheek tone that Goldfinger sort of inspired had already grown tiresome and over the top by Diamonds Are Forever.Connery is back, which is obviously a step up from Lazenby, but Blofeld once again changed actors. Apparently this reflects the chameleon like nature of Blofeld in the books, but it fails to create a sense of rhythm and consistency to the franchise. With that being said, he was one of the better Blofelds we have had and made for a decent foe. The problem is that the tone of the rest of the film is so goofy and dissimilar to what Bond and Blofeld are in. The action sequences are improved since the unorthodox editing of On Her Majesty's Secret Service without the strange settings of Thunderball and You Only Live Twice.Even the sidekick villains in the film are borderline un-watchable. By today's standards, these assumed gay characters would be seen as portrayed very offensively, but I guess that was just the time the film was released. So other than the fact that this film has the dumbest cops in film history, weird duo characters, and it's tonally inconsistent, it is a decently entertaining film. We finally get a good back and forth between Blofeld and Bond, and Connery is back (at least for one film).

With George Lazenby out of the picture and a small cavalcade of fill-ins dropping off for one reason or another, EON pressed the panic button and brought Sean Connery out of mothballs for a swan song. It's a mistake from the very start. Not only does Connery look unreasonably old for the part, he badly overplays his confidence and worldliness, often coming off as desperate and smarmy. The screen is crowded with gaudy sideshow characters, including a trashy, ditsy leading lady and two villainous hit men who seem far more concerned with excessively elaborate setups than actually doing away with anybody. Even longtime nemesis Blofeld, who may have been the sole beacon of excellence in the equally-forgettable You Only Live Twice, is ruined by an awful recasting, horrendous new personality quirks and a master plan that makes no sense whatsoever. But that's par for the course, really, as the plot at large is peppered with so many dumb jokes and absurd asides that just keeping up with this swerving, goofball storyline is a challenge worthy of MI-6. There's a good car chase midway through the second act (which loses some steam thanks to a similar pursuit, just a few minutes earlier, involving a freaking moon rover) and a few of the gags are so mind-blowingly stupid that I couldn't help but laugh, but otherwise this is a completely insignificant chapter in the character's long, speckled history.

They were also concerned that Bond was falling out of touch with audiences. What to do about this? I KNOW! How about a campy, silly, over-the-top cornball of a movie that would never work in any galaxy. Brilliant!!!! This movie, Diamonds are Forever, sucks.The story involves Bond stopping a diamond smuggling ring by the now so-silly villain I want to strangle him Blofeld (played ineptly by Charles Gray)and his seemingly gay henchman Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. He also joins forces with initially interesting but then falls into bimbo- status Tiffany Case, ho-ho funny.

He plays James Bond like a parody, sort of an Adam West version of it. (Fun fact Adam West was considered to take over the role from Lazenby) The rest of the cast is downright poor too, given poor lines and situations to act in. Jimmy Dean, the sausage king, is even given a pivotal role, ugh.This movie is just way to jokey and cynical to be passable as a film. I feel bad for Tom Mankiewicz, not because he did a poor job, but because he was directed to do so by the producers. What seemed like the norm back then, didn't even make those cinema-goers laugh. Good thing he redeemed himself in the next Bond film, and he later did a fantastic job as the writer of Superman I and II The Richard Donner Cut.There is only one thing about this movie that is awesome. The car chase in Las Vegas. Not only is the car involved a Boss 302 Mustang, but the fact that it is driven on two wheels which is amazing.

This time out Bond is put on the trail of some diamond thieves who are taking the items from South Africa and trying to get them into the United States. Once in the States Bond finds himself once again battling Blofeld (Charles Gray) who is held up in Las Vegas where there's more than just stolen diamond at stake. There's no question that this here was a major step up from the previous entry and I thought the opening sequence was masterfully done. It's obvious the director, producers and even Connery were aware that they had made a mistake by not having the now legend in the role and the opening sequence perfectly winks at the audience by not showing the actor doing the Bond stuff for the first couple scenes and then we're punched right in the face by a terrific opening where we finally see Connery. Some would probably argue that there's way too much cute stuff going on with Connery pretty much looking right into the camera and smiling but I would disagree because this is simply his role and it was a lot of fun seeing him back in it even after just being away for one film. I think the film also benefits from the Las Vegas settings because is there a better city to have someone like Bond in? I loved the stuff in the casino and especially one sequence where a money grabber goes back to Bond's room with him only to be tossed out the window. Another good thing working in this film is that it's a tad bit more adult in nature than the previous entries. We get some mild cuss words, some more graphic violence and even a tad bit of nudity. That's not to say this film is pure sleaze because it isn't but at the same time it's fun seeing it a tad bit more grown up. Connery is certainly welcomed back and it's apparent he's having a lot of fun in the film as he's perfect in the role. The walk, the talk and pretty much everything else is masterfully done. Gray is pretty good in the role of Blofeld but I must admit that I thought he was still the weakest of the three actors who played him in this portion of films. Putter Smith and Bruce Glover play the bad guys and both were a great delight and added so much fun to the film. I've read a few reviews that put them down for being too gay but I thought that was rather unfair as the characters were just so much fun. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are both wonderful as the Bond girls with St. John doing a fantastic job and making for one of the more memorable love interest roles. The fun doesn't stop there as we even get Bruce Cabot (KING KONG) in his final role. Add in a terrific sequence by Bernard Lee and you've got the most impressive all-around cast from the Bond pictures so far. The action scenes are mostly good, although a couple of the special effects are embarrassingly bad. Outside of a few pacing problems the terrific cast makes this a very entertaining entry in the series.

The two bounce off each other beautifully, and even though Diana Rigg was probably the best Bond Girl as an actress (see On Her Majesty's Secret Service), Jill St. John seems to have landed the best Bond Girl character that's ever been in a Bond film. Her character, Tiffany Case, is smart, savvy, wise-cracking and sophisticated and certainly knows what she's on about, and played beautifully by Jill St. John (even if some people complain that she looks like a nun in a brothel in the fight scenes). Compared with the usual vicious/ice maiden/dumb Bond girls that seem to appear in every other movie, Jill's portrayal of Tiffany Case makes her, in my opinion, the best and most enjoyable of all the Bond Girls.Certainly the script has some of the best dialogue ever written for a Bond film, however, as usual, one must not look too deeply into the plot of a James Bond film. Like Octopussy, Diamonds Are Forever tends to have a plot which if you scrutinise too closely doesn't make sense...but really who cares?? It's a great film overall.Charles Gray plays a wonderful, campy Bloefeld with beautiful sly dialogue and a delicious arrogant wit. In fact the dialogue in this film is the closest a Bond film has ever come to sounding like Oscar Wilde or Bernard Shaw. Although not in that class, it nevertheless makes it a thoroughly entertaining film, and that's what James Bond is all about!Technically, the film has some problems. The cinematography, especially in the Nevada desert scenes, is not good. There's also a bit too much post-sync dubbing with the extras which is delivered badly by voice actors. In fact one thing you always find in a lot of Bond films is a proliferation of awful actors in very minor roles. This didn't really improve until maybe The Spy Who Loved Me.But alas, I'm just being picky! Diamonds Are Forever is a highly entertaining Bond film with a great slice of wit and sophistication, excellent fight scenes and a very satisfactory car chase in the streets of Las Vegas.So you want to know how to make the perfect James Bond film? Well I have the answer take the wit and sophistication (and sassy Bond girl) of Diamonds Are Forever, mix it together with the sumptuous style (and quirkiness) of Goldfinger, put in the globe-trotting glamour of The Spy Who Loved Me, add some high octaine action from The World Is Not Enough (or any other Pierce Brosnan film will do) and finally top it off with the solid plot sensibility of For Your Eyes Only. And voila the perfect Bond film. (Although I am going to say Thanks Pierce, it's been nice having you, but we need someone now with a bit more style/humour/ease/edge).

Bond is asked to investigate a diamond operation and eventually uncovers a supervillain plot to blackmail the world by Spectre. The plot is fine, except for the use and portrayal of lasers (ahh, to have had the internet and research back then). Connery, however, has aged... the stress and hassles of being Bond once more and aging make him a little less impressive, and the script seems more suited to a Lazenby or Moore than to Connery. Supposedly to regain the American audiences lost when OHMSS did not do as well in US box offices, the film is based entirely in the USA and many famous American bit actors appear. (oddly enough, Live and let Die - the first Moore film, is also heavy in US locations). The movie follows the standard formula begun with 'Goldfinger and could even be called a re-make of it- just substitute the lust for gold with the need for diamonds.Connery gives a fine performance as Bond... dialoguing as well as he ever has- he just looks tired and out of shape (which, considering the movie begins with his seeking revenge for the loss of his one and only wife- Tracy, who was gunned down in the previous movie works in the plot at first.)The movie has taken undo criticism for homophobia in the portrayal of two assassins- actually, it was rather brave to even suggest it, as homosexuality was not a truly open topic for the movie audience this was aimed at (even Midnight Cowboy got the X rating for its subtle yet frank depiction of male and gay prostitution). The two characters are humorous, but claims they play to stereotypes are misfounded. Neither plays the more familiar campy queen hair-stylist/interior decorator homosexual often mocked in comedy. Both are efficient killers. Bond movies had already hinted at homosexuality twice before (Col. Kleb in From Russia With Love makes extremely subtle advances on Tanya and Pussy Galore and her troupe were all supposed to be lesbians, as in the novel), but it was forced to be subtler or implied. In DAF, they push the envelope and make no doubts as to the orientation. Again, the criticism is unjust.Anyhow, in this story, Bond is asked to investigate an apparent diamond smuggling operation that is leaving a trail of corpses from South Africa to las Vegas. Bond comes across one Tiffany Case who seems to be a ringleader for the smuggling operation and slowly gets her to start helping him. As Bond delves into this mystery further, however, he uncovers a plot to use a diamond-based laser gun in orbit to blackmail the world into paying a ransom. All this circles around the industries of a recluse billionaire, Willard Whyte. Bond eventually discovers that it is Blofeld and SPECTRE up to their tricks again and must stop them and save Willard Whyte.The weakest point is the Jill St. John character, Tiffany Case. Set up at the start of the film as a key cog in a smuggling operation, self-assured and intelligent, by the end of the picture she has become another bouncing Bond bikini-clad bimbo, clumsy and silly. Had she been a more consistent portrayal, the movie would have been even better. Country singer and sausage king Jimmy Dean plays Willard Whyte- a casino owner and billionaire based on Howard Hughes. He comes off a bit of a country bumpkin; he's is okay, but he could have been better.The usual special effects, innovative chases, wonderful camera work is all here. A fine effort with a couple of weak spots that might make one cringe here or there, but Connery hangs up his license to kill very well.

After the artistic peak of OHMSS, this film seems like it belongs to another franchise altogether--maybe Shaft?The script is terrible, the jokes fall flat, the lighting is horrid, Connery looks 65, and the film has lost all the polish and grit of the 60s film series. Its clear that the story is just scaffolding for the action. Connery breaks into a set for a moon landing and then steals a moon car thing and spends the next 15 minutes being chased by goons. Why exactly?

It's one of the most tightly directed, humorous, and most intelligent of the twenty-one.The plot is very smart. It moves with elusive and detailed grace. You will be surprised when certain characters or story elements leave and then suddenly return after the streaming of the plot has seemingly established itself. Diamonds Are Forever has two of the best Bond villains of the whole series, a sadistic and ruthless gay couple that finishes each other's sentences.Sean Connery is possibly at his sexiest as Bond here in his final round in the official series, debonair as can be and with the suavest delivery of one-liners and mandatory bad puns upon beating someone up or killing them. He is without a doubt the best of all the Bonds.Jill St. John, doubtlessly one of the sexiest Bond women ever, is given the short straw however, projecting one of the film's few flaws. She begins as a surprisingly clever and resourceful early Bond woman. It is only the fault of the writing that she, a common American criminal, somehow knows of elite British Secret Service agent James Bond, as if he were a celebrity, or that she spots Blofeld by his white cat even though she had never seen either one before, nor was there any chance for Bond to describe to her Blofeld or the cat. Alas, being an early Bond woman, her strength of character just could not last. Gradually throughout the film, her character becomes ditsier, weaker, dumber, and without clarity in her character's motivation. This is typical of Bond films and the earlier the Bond film, the more prevalent that unfortunate chauvinistic element is. At least most of the earlier Bond women were better actresses than they were in the later Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton films. It was an even trade-off In order to be a powerful female character in a James Bond movie, you had to be a bad actress. If you were a good actress, you had to be a weak little girlie.Driving the movie alone is the theme song sung by Shirley Bassey and John Barry's brilliant and pulsing score. James Bond films are known for the strength in their music, and Diamonds Are Forever is one of the brightest highlights in that area.

Title Certainly sounds good and fits with the plot, but doesn't really make sense.Pre-Titles We see Bond storming around trying to find the whereabouts of Blofeld, who he tracks to a facility that makes doppelgangers and appears to kill Blofeld in heated mud. This is a pretty silly opening, with Bond throwing henchmen around like rag dolls and lines like ''Caaa&#x85;Caaa&#x85;Cairo!'' delivered painfully over- the-top. Bond also seems pretty content here all things considered, did he forget Blofeld killed his wife?Theme Song Shirley Bassey returns and provides a dreamy, seductive song that is one of the better things here. It's a very atmospheric piece and Bassey has a great powerful voice. It doesn't fit the film at all but that's a good thing really.Plot Large shipments of diamonds have been disappearing and Bond is sent to America to find it what has happened to them. He quickly learns that Blofeld is behind the smuggling and plans to use the diamonds to power a satellite that can destroy anything it targets. The plot is both boring and confusing, with most of the film being Bond moving from place to place and Blofeld's scheme being in the background most of the time. The film really lacks the excitement of Connery's earlier films too, nothing that memorable happens and it feels more like a series of moments before coming to an increasingly dull climax.James Bond Sean Connery phones it in and all the coolness he once possessed has left him by this point. He delivers every line with the same bored expression and to be fair the material he's given is pretty weak, but he delivers it like he doesn't care which does the film no favours. Connery clearly aged badly too and this makes Bond look very haggard throughout.Bond Girls Jill St John looks great as Tiffany Case, but that's it. Case is incredibly boring and every line she says is delivered annoyingly. She also gets stupider the longer the film goes on, which results in her being a beyond useless ally and hilariously terrible in the climax. Lana Wood is pretty weak as Plenty O'Toole, in fact her name is only used for the use of a joke. Wood is extremely inexpressive and is another dumb female here, it's impossible to believe that Bond would be attracted to her. Villains Charles Gray is completely miscast as Blofeld. He has no menace whatsoever and takes a far too campy approach to the role. In all their scenes he treats Bond with a polite interest and you'd never guess he was a mastermind villain. The scene where he dresses in drag was downright insulting. Bruce Glover and Putter Smith as the weird homosexual assassins Wint and Kidd they are actually quite fun. They're daft villains, but they clearly know it and at least have fun with the roles.Support Norman Burton makes a truly dreadful Leiter. He just plays him as a bumbling fool and the character is completely incompetent, Bond should hate him at this point. Jimmy Dean as the reclusive Whyte is abysmal. Luckily he has limited screen time, but his southern drawl is ear scraping and Whyte is just a rich ignorant fool for the sake of it.Action It's all very exaggerated and campy here. Bond escapes via moon buggy in a truly stupid scene and even avoids being cremated at one point. These could be good scenes, but they are shot with no excitement. The lift fight is nicely vicious, but it looks awkward and limits the fight if anything. The climax is horrific, things blow-up unconvincingly and Bond swings Blofeld around in a pod in a climax that is beyond underwhelming. We get a decent car chase around Las Vegas that is shot well, but that is pretty much it.Score John Barry keeps his excellent record intact with another enjoyable score. It has a bombastic sound that fits the films overblown style and it is successful in creating a sense of excitement. It's a shame that it's wasted here.Production Values Guy Hamilton clearly tried to recapture the pure entertainment formula that worked so well with Goldfinger and he fails to do so miserably. There is a weirdly camp tone present throughout the film and it doesn't lend itself to the thrilling action we expect from Bond. In a way this film feels more like a self-parody than an actually Bond film. Visually it is very weak, there aren't any shots that standout and it just doesn't feel like a big film like the previous films were. The locations aren't any special either and having it set in the United States makes it more limited, though Las Vegas looks suitably colourful. The script is another weak spot, there are no memorable lines and there are some really terrible lines like ''You just killed James Bond!'' which don't help matters. The special effects deserve a mention because they are just awful, the explosions are some of the fakest looking I've ever seen on film.Conclusion I'd say that Diamonds Are Forever is possibly the worst Bond film, easily in the bottom three. There are some truly terrible features here and it just feels lazy, in the end there are barely any redeeming qualities. People point the finger at Moore for campiness, but this is where the campy tone is at its very worst and it doesn't suit a Connery film at all. Almost the entire cast is awful, the action is dull, the plot is complicated for the sake of it, it's not interesting visually and Connery clearly doesn't care. The few good points are Bassey's theme and Barry's score, and that isn't enough. This is Bond at its very worse, bloated, strange and extremely lazy.

'Diamonds Are Forver' was the follow up, and is cemented at the very bottom of most Bond lists.Sean Connery looks like he couldn't care less what's going on in this film.

The action is timid and dull, the locations are far from inspired and Charles Gray is nothing short of pathetic in the role of Bond's nemesis, Blofeld, who seems to have gone from uber-villain to uber-camp cabaret act. Seriously, he's about as fearsome as my grandmother.It is important to bear in mind that Blofeld murdered Bond's wife at the end of the last film. In spite of this, Bond seems to consider him a mere annoyance in this movie, rather than the object of blind rage, as you might expect. Their confrontation is more akin to Austin Powers vs Dr Evil than it is to Bond vs Blofeld from the previous films. The performances of Connery and Gray in these scenes may as well have been shot on different days, there is that little tension between them.Thinking about it, there is really nothing at all memorable about this tripe. Even John Barry's score felt mediocre after OHMSS. This film is a disgrace to the franchise and to Connery's career. The only small redemption is that Connery's used the whopping fee he earned for this to make 'The Offence' with Sidney Lumet. Ignore 'Diamonds' and watch that. You'll thank me later.

Tired with Cubby Broccoli's insistence, he asked for a ridiculously high amount of money to do Bond again. Surprisingly, they accepted! So ol' Sean had to do the movie, but he had an ace up his sleeve he intentionally acted the worse he could, to keep himself protected to return to 007 anymore.That's why his performance in Diamonds Are Forever is the single worst one in all his career. He looks intentionally bored, makes faces that read wish I was somewhere else, and underplays James Bond as much, that he over-underacts (if such a thing is possible). Truly, this man is an acting genius, equally effective in giving awesome performances (like in The Man Who Would Be King, The Name of the Rose, or pick any other film with him that's not this one) than in serving loads of acting poo poo.I'm not saying Diamonds Are Forever is bad only because of this boycott. Even with Sean at his finest, this movie would suck. The screenplay is a joke! From the flipping-side car to the Place that tape back, Mr. Bond conclusion, everything's unbelievably ridiculous, and predates the worst Roger Moore-era silliness (and yes, the guys who defined it as A Roger Moore Bond starring Sean Connery got it right). In fact, this is the first Bond film in the series where the script stinks (most of the ones after would stink too). Redeeming features? Just one Bond is still, and for the most part, the cold womanizer I like to watch instead of the romantic hero of such stinkers as The Spy Who Loved Me or The Living Daylights. Anyway, even this is destroyed in a scene prior to the climax, Bond seems worried about Tiffany Case. The Bond I adore is the one that loses all interest in women after he has slept with her!It's unbelievable how many Bond fans like this film but trash the far superior Never Say Never Again. True, NSNA didn't have Desmond Llewelyn, Lois Maxwell or Bernard Lee, but it had a better story, script and pacing, and, best of all, Connery's acting is good and he seems to be enjoying the joke (the entire film is a joke, starting from the title, but it's a serious movie at the same time, and it's not cheesy). That makes Never Say Never Again one of the best Bond films, and Diamonds Are Forever the only bad Connery-Bond movie.Bond fans, give it a look, then forget about it.

It goes from Bond's arch-nemesis gets slammed head first into hot mud while on a operating table to stealing a moon buggy to fighting off chicks called Bambi and Thumper that do acrobatic moves. To the stereotypical villains giving away their whole plan to the spy.

It's the best sort of time-capsule and thoroughly entertaining. I've always been a fan of the more understated Bond films, meaning I tend towards the earlier ones with fewer extraneous explosions and more locations. Here we are taken to Amsterdam and especially Las Vegas. I love the scenes shot in the casino! The era of wood paneling is long gone but I love revisiting! Can anyone imagine a performer like Shady Tree today? One of my favorite puns is in the name of Plenty O'Toole - it's a riot! The direction is really spot-on as well. The scenes in the crematorium are amazing and eerie. The plot IS a bit off balance but that doesn't distract from the fun. The ending, as with most Bond films, if predictable but at least it doesn't linger too long. Jill St. John is a bit wooden at times but in the end just manages to pull it off and is very nice to look at. Sean is in fine form throughout. The score (aside from the title song with neither I nor Harry Saltzman liked) is very good. One of the most entertaining films you'll ever see and in the end it's about being well entertained.

Bond survives the transition to the 1970s without abandoning his aristocratic bearing he doubles down on the wine scenes in Goldfinger by identifying the year of a sherry. The supporting cast, on the other hand, is dominated by plain-spoken, even hick-ish Americans, and the contrasting textures work. The CIA throws around American football terms, Grand Ole Opry performer Jimmy Dean plays a thickly-accented southern millionaire, and Jill St. John is the first Bond girl to hail from the States. The Las Vegas setting doesn't click as well as the actors, lacking as it does the beauty and class of previous Bond locales like Venice, Istanbul, and the Swiss Alps. Ken Adam's wide, low, modernistic sets are in especially fine form this time around, however. There is a lot of humor in the script, yet the plot is a low-stakes rehash of the one in From Russia With Love, Thunderball, and You Only Live Twice. A pair of killer gymnasts, Bambi and Thumper, are strange and amusing, but the film's other assassin duo is the more remarkable. Bruce Glover and Putter Smith are charismatic as Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, but unfortunately they minstrel as a gay couple, making them among the franchise's most fraught figures.

Bond has to find out.Exotic locations Holland, Las Vegas (U.S.A).This has to be one of the slenderist justifications to utilise James Bond on a mission. Of course, the decision to use Bond on this mission will be justified, eventually, but really it seems as if the producers had the theme song first and decided to make a movie having something to do with diamonds...just so that they could use the song!Annoyingly, at this point the franchise knows that this spy is a cultural phenomenon, and they really play up to that. His charisma is taken for granted...and even abused...he gets to deliver one liners on a par with that Las Vegas casino comedian he sees (in this movie). Having Bond be a celebrity spy now is a bit of a low point for the franchise...a spy whose reputation precedes them? Is that advisable in the spying business?Sadly, this movie seems to pretend that the last instalment - On her majesty's secret service - never happened. Sad because not only is it not fit to polish that movie's shoes (!), it is also a rather disappointing effort by Connery's own standards.Bond formula Pre-title sequence Desperately seeking Blofeld.Theme song Shirley Bassey gives Connery a great farewell with this classic.Q A staple in the series by now.Silly female names Tiffany Case (get it?)...I do like Bond's comments to her on whether he prefers blondes or brunettes...he doesn't mind provided the collars and cuffs match!

DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is the one in Las Vegas with the reclusive billionaire, the diamond smuggling, the elevator fight, the moon buggy, the slot machines, the two-wheel tilted car stunt, the off-shore oil rig, and the effete henchmen, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd.Sean Connery returns to the series for his sixth turn as 007, after skipping the previous film ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969). The producers paid a pretty penny to bring back the fan-favorite, one last time. They also brought back Guy Hamilton, the director of 1964's hugely successful GOLDFINGER, and Shirley Bassey, who sings another iconic title song. The producers seemed to want to recapture the magic of the earlier Bond adventures, after MAJESTY'S took a different approach.Connery looks noticeably older this time around, with his bushy eyebrows and longer sideburns. (It was 1971, afterall.) It's not his most crisp performance as 007, but he knew what he had to do.The main Bond girl is Jill St. John as Tiffany Case, a diamond trafficker who comes to aid Bond in his efforts. She wears bikinis and various other revealing clothing, while occasionally stepping on Bond's toes. There's also the lovely Lana Wood (little sister to Natalie Wood) in a brief role as Plenty O'Toole, a girl who has bad luck with swimming pools. Jimmy Dean (the sausage guy) plays Willard Whyte, an American billionaire styled after Howard Hughes. Charles Gray, who plays an entirely different role in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (1967), appears as Bond's nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld.In this adventure James Bond finds himself chased through the streets of Las Vegas, escaping through the Nevada desert in a robotic moon cruiser, buried in a pipeline, and nearly cremated. He also must deal with the odd henchmen Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. (Mr. Wint has a penchant for cologne and Mr. Kidd looks like a walrus.)Although DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is not one of my top favorite Bond movies, I've always kind of liked it. It's got the classic look of the larger-than-life James Bond adventures, I guess the pieces just don't measure up to some of the other films. Connery's other Bond movies just did everything a little bit better. I do think Connery was looking a little too old in this film, and some aspects are a little campy (crashing the moon landing, Mr. Wint's remarks). It is a rather breezy secret agent romp for the middle-aged 007. But I enjoy the Las Vegas setting, with the bright lights and casinos. And Jill St. John sure looks great. DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER follows the winning James Bond formula, but ends up being a lackluster Sean Connery outing.

After that we get a plot about diamond smuggling and some kind of evil scheme including nuclear warfare and world domination that is as difficult to follow as it is to care for, but it does provide a good playfield for Bond. Most notably, there is a great fight scene in an elevator, and a sensational car chase through Las Vegas.This was Sean Connery's last film as James Bond (save the somewhat unofficial Never Say Never Again), which might explain why he looks a bit uninspired. Nevertheless, an uninspired Connery is still better than most actors, at least in this role. With very few gadgets and virtually no screen time for Q and Moneypenny, he has to carry the film a lot on his own, and still does a good job with that. There are still some complaints to be made about Diamonds Are Forever. It features the usual dull climax at the villain's base with lots of explosions and an alarming countdown, and the henchmen Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are awfully weird and misplaced. It is unsure who they are working for or what they are doing, and the homosexual subtext is strangely out of place.

For instance he could tie something around a woman's neck and start strangling her, whereas Moore stated, that his 007 could not go to that extreme.

However, unfortunately Connery's send off isn't his strongest. Diamonds are Forever is, along with You Only Live Twice and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, a serviceable, but not spectacular, Bond film. It is entertaining at times, but also feels weak and worn occasionally, not really rising above the average.Diamonds are Forever finds 007 tracking down Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray, the third, and ostensibly final, actor to play the part) to exact revenge for the death of his wife at the end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. After taking care of that business, he is given a new assignment crack a diamond smuggling ring that is transporting diamonds from Africa to America. Time is of the essence, as the various members of the ring are being killed off one by one, and Bond must try to infiltrate the operation before it completely shuts down. He takes the identity of one of the smugglers and meets up with Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), one of the last stops on the trail and ends up transporting the diamonds to Las Vegas, where it appears the smuggling has been orchestrated by the reclusive millionaire Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean) who plans to use the diamonds in a orbital device that will allow him to hold the world hostage.Diamonds are Forever does benefit from the bonus of having Connery back in the role after sitting On Her Majesty's Secret Service out, and he is in decent form as Bond, with plenty of snappy one liners to deliver with his usual deft charm, but by this point the Bond series had begun a slide into a realm of self-mockery that would become disastrous in a few more films, and while Diamonds are Forever is a still serious enough to have some weight to it, you can see the start of a bad trend for the Bond films. The Bond girl here, Tiffany Case, is a bit of ditz as well, not really up to the level of some of the classics. St. John is somewhat memorable in the role, her performance isn't bad, but the character as a whole is relatively lower grade compared to Tracy or Pussy Galore.Diamonds are Forever also features relatively little in the way of standout action. Sure, there are some chases and fight scenes, but nothing to really take your breath away. It is all rather pedestrian stuff, hardly capable of quickening your pulse. Diamonds are Forever does feature some entertaining henchmen in the form of Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) and Mr. Wynt (Bruce Glover) who prove to be amusing when on screen, although nowhere near as intimidating and Oddjob or Fiona Volpe. Villain-wise, Charles Grey is not the strongest Blofeld of the series, Pleasance was still the best, so you hardly feel much dislike for him.When James Bond is at its best, it can prove to be an enormously entertaining romp. Here, when it seems to just be going through the motions and not really hitting any high notes, it can serve as a mildly entertaining lark, but nothing too memorable.

It stars reluctant Sean Connery, agreeing to come back for one last outing after the disastrous response to George Lazenby's one picture stint in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. A South African diamond smuggling ring is cause for concern on this occasion. Not up to Bond's usual assignments, you say? Well, no&#133;if it weren't for the fact that everyone associated with these sparkling gems turns up dead. After killing the next link in the smuggling chain, Peter Franks (Joe Robinson) Bond assumes the smuggler's identity to get to the bottom of things. What he discovers is that his old arch nemesis, Blofeld (on this occasion played by Charles Gray) is running the show, this time from the bachelor pad of a reclusive Las Vegas millionaire, Willard Whyte (sausage king, Jimmy Dean).On reflection, the best thing about this film is its no nonsense Bond girl, Tiffany Case (Jill St. John). She represents a considerable shift in definition of the 'Bond girl' from sultry young plaything to fast thinking, sharp-shooting accomplice. The worst thing about the film is its inclusion of, what can only be classified as the most politically incorrect coupling; Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) and Mr. Wynt (Bruce Glover) a pair of homosexual tongue-in-cheek assassins. The rest of the plot and staging is pretty much par for the course while transforming Bond into something of the vein of Smoky & the Bandit. Lana Wood makes a brief but memorable cameo as crap shooter, Plenty O'Toole. Trina Park and Lola Lawson briefly appear as two acrobatic assassins, Bambi and Thumper, who are easily foiled by James in a reflecting pool outside Whyte's desert home. The anamorphic widescreen transfer from MGM/UA DVD is fairly appealing. Despite several inexplicable occasions where an obtrusive amount of film grain suddenly appears in a single shot, then just as inexplicably disappears, the overall film elements of Diamonds Are Forever are smooth and free of digital or age related anomalies. Colors are somewhat dated but overall nicely balanced. Flesh tones are rarely accurate &#150; appearing too pink or too orange and pasty. Blacks are velvety deep and solid. Whites are generally clean. The audio is Dolby surround but lacking in any bass and with a very frontal sound. Dialogue never sounds natural. Special effects are often shrill and strident.

There is, though, little actual tension and suspense though one scene with Bond trapped in a coffin being cremated is very tense. The oil rig climax is very limp,and Connery seems increasingly disinterested in the proceedings,while Jill St John is mostly irritating.

So, four years after donning the tuxedo for You Only Live Twice, Mr Connery once again found himself delineating 007. It's an assured performance and, although a bit old-looking, he is a joy to watch as everyone's favourite secret agent. The plot, however, doesn't serve Connery as well as it ought to. In an incoherent, kaleidoscopic rag-bag of a storyline, Bond finds himself trying to thwart a plot to use a destructive laser satellite - powered up by diamonds - to wipe out the major world cities. The architect of this sinister scheme? Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who else? Bond's mission takes him from Amsterdam to Las Vegas and ultimately to the villain's HQ aboard a Pacific oil-rig. There are memorable moments along the way, including a peculiar scene at a crematorium, an invigorating car chase around Vegas, and a classic fight between Bond and two female guards named Bambi and Thumper. Jill St. John is quite good as the main Bond girl (though her character is a bit dim at times), and Shirley Bassey provides one of the true classic theme tunes from the series. However, the big drawback - as mentioned earlier - is the outlandish plot.

The opening scenes before the titles set us up for a Bond who now has personal reasons to eliminate Blofeld.  The editing is quick during the fight scene and it sure is good having Sirley Bassey sing the title song like she did for Goldfinger. The rest of the movie has some fun moments as Bond trys to pick up the trail of what seems like an open and shut diamond smuggling scheme.  There is a good balance of Bond dialogue (with Charles Gray as Blofeld) and Bond action (car chases that devastate a parking lot in Vegas) that will please most devotees.  Jill St. John doesn't grab me as the most outstanding counterpart for Bond, but she is effective enough for what is given within the storyline.  The strong points here are Connery, who seems to look about the age we picture Bond in the books, and Charles Gray as Blofeld.  There IS some TERRIBLE acting by Bruce Glover and Putter Smith as Wint and Kidd, the assassin team, but you can almost tune this out.   I still enjoy this film, because it  got me hooked on the series, and while I don't tout it as a Bond masterpiece, it was nice to see Connery back as Bond and it has many entertaining monents if you've seen others. Definitely worth watching.Rating 8 out of 10.

The Bond franchise had been going well until this installment. While a fair distance from some of the horrors of later bad installments, DAF is a campy and flat affair full of bad jokes, poor performances and soulless stunts. Evidently thinking Bond two wheeling through an alley, driving a moon buggy through the desert and spending most of the finale in a crane is exciting, this one lacks the sparkle of the various locations used. DAF is still an escapist movie, boasts the odd thrill and is a bit of a relief after the darkness of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but a complete lack of any reference to Tracy is pretty annoying. The Bond girl this time is a pretty weak and annoying character. Charles Gray is by far the worst on screen Blofeld although Mr Wint and Mr Kidd are good villains, though underused ultimately.It's entertaining enough and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's hardly a disaster but it is just a bit lifeless. The plot is pleasingly straight forward although the script is a bit silly. The fatal flaw is the campy tone. Similar tonal issues would plague the Roger Moore era. It forgoes tension for not particularly funny humour. When Blofeld turns up again it's no surprise and the finale just isn't as good as it could have been. Everything in DAF is colourful and campy and the grit of Ian Fleming's novels is nowhere to be found. It isn't serious enough to work and while humour is a good thing there's too much of it here. The next installment Live and Let Die managed to reach a better tone. While not the worst in the Bond canon this is one of the weaker entries with the normally reliable Sean Connery completely going through the motions and failing to generate any excitement.

They offered him a hefty sum to return, but Connery wanted none of it. After George Lazenby's antics on the set On Her Majesty's Secret Service, they didn't want him back (Though the movie was actually very good) so Connery decided to make a return to this series. Like Never Say, Never Again, Connery should have stayed away. The movie is rather dull to be honest, and lacks the excitement I look for in a James Bond movie. The best scene that really sticks out for me is the finale in the yacht involving Blofeld. But I was just ready for the film to end before that, so the impact wasn't nearly as strong as it should have been. Sean Connery is OK, but it's not one of his best performances as Bond. I really question his decision to come back, even if he is the best Bond of all time. Jill St. John is probably my favorite part of this film. I enjoyed her unpredictable and enigmatic character. Charles Gray is OK as Blofeld, but I prefer Donald Pleseance in that role. Why was he even cast as the villain?! He was Bond's friend in You Only Live Twice, and subsequently killed! Lana Wood makes for a sexy villain as a Bond girl.Final Thoughts Meh. I didn't really care for this one, I'm sorry to say. It's a bit too dull and ordinary for its own good.

Having left on some unscrupulous terms, disagreements with the production company and two mediocre films in a row, he blasts back into the fray with an entry that maintains the grounded, un-Bondian feel that had to follow the likes of Thunderball and You Only Live Twice in this Diamonds are Forever. In a sense, this is like a combination of the aforementioned two films as well as George Lazenby's lone entry On Her Majesty's Secret Service; combining a rooted sensibility with that unmistakable panache Connery brings to the role on top of its desire to tick the usual boxes in providing all the glamorous women; stunts as well as a showdown in an enemy's lair. There is an odd feeling of change littered throughout Diamonds are Forever, an odd imbalanced gear to things wherein Bond's actor is different; Blofeld's actor has changed, although the actor already appeared in one of Connery's earlier entries, on top of this very gradual sense that things are coming to an end for Blofeld's organisation SPECTRE. Preceding this entry and as the franchise grew, there is an unmistakable sense that Bond has already picked his way through the various villains associated with the organisation and now, following two duels with the man himself, the end may very well be neigh.The film begins with Connery seeking vengeance for something that happened to the same character when it was played by another man. Now seemingly immune to women after having genuinely loved one in the last entry, only to have her taken away from him, he is sceptic to the charms of a bikini-clad bimbo and instead uses the very item that accentuates her sexuality, in her clothing, to demand answers through an interrogation. One thing leads to another and Charles Gray's Blofeld is happened upon in a secret base wherein he has successfully cloned himself. Things are rounded off with Blofeld seemingly out of the picture and with the series free to crack on with fresh directions.The bulk of the piece comes to revolve around a smuggling ring, a ring specialising in the transporting of diamonds from South Africa to Europe. Back in London at headquarters, Bond even asks as to why the department being brought in on such a routine operation. One imagines that, after averting the world's economy from collapsing and foiling plots to initiate a Third World War a full two times, this would seem rather droll in comparison. Those thieves, bandits and crooks in the smuggling trade don't even know how close they came to annihilation on two separate counts, had it not been for the heroism of this man. Here, he is told to impersonate a renowned diamond smuggler, who has already been caught, and infiltrate the circles abroad by first meeting with his American contact. Mission in tow, Bond is far from sent jetting off to the far flung thriving metropolis' of Tokyo, nor indeed is he sent to somewhere whereby he may garner access to Jamaica's rum bars and tropical beaches. Nor even is he sent packing to the mysterious passageways and Cold War paranoia drenched streets of Istanbul. No, for he takes a hovercraft to Holland.When he arrives, we observe a decent first hour or so in what essentially transpires to be a prelude to something like Charley Varrick, or even Peckinpah's The Getaway. While vastly inferior to each of those examples, the film maintains this bizarre atmospheric of chase and deception as each party tries to remain one up in the company of another; something unknown in a Bond film to this point and not again seen until 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, where the arid locale of Egypt doubled up for this scorching playground wherein varying parties would try to get their hands on some valuable data at the cost, potentially, of one another's lives. Jill St. John plays the American contact, a woman named Tiffany Case who exudes a sort of tantalising presence on the screen as business and pleasure threaten to meld together on top of the fact Bond is deceiving her in adopting a false identity. Two folks who are desperate to get their hands on the diamonds are the quite riotous Mr. Wint (Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Smith), two homosexual hit men, whose choice of lifestyle does rear up some problematic issues for the film but regardless, quite honestly steal the film.The film is synonymous with an era in the Bond franchise whereby surrounding entries saw Bond tackle class-A drugs; an elusive assassin and a form of pharmaceutical warfare inherent in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. There is a great deal of colour and exuberance to the film, perhaps surprisingly so. Here is the follow up to the film that saw Bond lose a lover, but there isn't necessarily an mite of anguish nor suffering. Moreover, there features a homosexual hit men couple; the odd sequence whereby two women seemingly beat Bond up in a luxury Nevada villa for absolutely no apparent reason; a car chase involving a moon-buggy and the shrill glamour and spectacle of seeing a place such as Las Vegas in a Bond film where, ordinarily, grot and greyed out colour schemes dominate an already oppressive espionage atmosphere. I don't suppose there's anything greatly wrong with Diamonds are Forever, it just isn't a particularly fascinating entry; worse were made earlier, better were made subsequently &#x96; this is brighter, more sparky entry which uses its MacGuffin well and pulls some neat surprises on us.

This film has been slated many, many times - and I'm afraid it's not going to get off easily from your friendly resident neighbourhood Bond fanatic, either!After supposedly killing Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Grey - why isn't he bald?) Bond returns to normal service. He is assigned to investigate a series of drug smuggling operations that spreads the world over. In Amsterdam he meets Tiffany Case (Jill St John), one of the members of this pipeline, and together they travel to Las Vegas. Bond learns that the culprit is one Willard Whyte, a Las Vegas tycoon who hasn't been seen for years. After climbing up into Whyte's personal suite, Bond discovers that Whyte is in fact Blofeld - or at least, one of Blofeld's clones. He plans to use the diamonds in a laser up in space that magnifies the sun's rays towards fields of nuclear weapons, and demanding a ransom for the surviving weapons from the other countries. Bond stops Blofeld aboard his Oil Rig of Terror - when has an oil rig been terrible? Oh God, where do I start?It's not that film is meant to be bad - far from it - it just is so very, very BAD! Connery should not have returned to the Bond franchise, it just confuses everything utterly with the matter of the previous film. The fact that his dead wife is never mentioned is one major loophole - but see the Message Board for this movie and you will see an interesting interpretation from yours truly.EYE-CANDY Jill St John is where the Bond girls started to have bigger bra sizes than IQs. She starts off really well, though, and you get the feeling that this tough woman is let down by a really bad script! Lana Wood steps in for what in essence becomes a meaningless role as Plenty O'Toole - Named after your father, perhaps? asks Bond dryly. Because of the edits of this film, the importance of this character is seriously diminished, and she just becomes another piece of eye candy. (Though WHAT a piece of eye candy!)BADDIES Cahrles Grey as Blofeld is an interesting idea, and with hindsight could have been very successful. But in the end, along with Jill St John, this fine actor is let down by a bad script, and his end is not particularly dramatic or amusing to watch. However, one positive from this movie comes from Mr Wint and Mr Kidd, (Putter Smith & Bruce Glover), a pair of odd assassins who are well suited to the Bond universe of strange characters. They are very funny in some scenes - it's just a pity that the humour used for the was used for everybody else.OVERALL There is no disguising that this is a very disappointing film to watch, and a times is almost dreadful. But perhaps we must keep this in mind. Connery did not, at the end of the day, keep his pay packet. All the money he was paid went towards his new charity for Scottish children.

Lip service is paid to the M-Q-Moneypenny axis whilst many jokes, tropes and gadgets are dropped.

A second attempt to recreate the Bullitt car chase (in night-time Las Vegas) is left high and dry without musical cues, which unlike the Bullitt chase, it needs. Above all in this poorly thought-out screenplay the action sags with each tableau initiated by the clapper-board and closed with a gag.Connery is a welcome presence but jokes his way through the production, clearly unable to find Bond's purpose. Jill St. John has charisma and looks but no bite to either help Connery or fight Hamilton.

DAF is also the most 'American' Bond movie until Dalton's second outing. It's apparent in every single scene that they didn't quite know where to stick to the original style or shift towards Hollywood images. But this still isn't a bad Bond movie - at least not as 'bad' as movies like 'Man With The Golden Colt' or the other 'American' Bond, License To Kill.It's also the most cynical and ill-balanced Bond movie, shifting from traditional traits to pretty sick and TOO sexist 'jokes' - even for Bond.But for fans..., and that's not to be underestimated, it still has its values.And excellent title song.

After George Lazenby turned down the offer for this movie after his single 007 performance in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), the producers were desperately looking for a new Bond actor. As Roger Moore was bound to his Persuaders TV series at that time and another promising young actor, Timothy Dalton, considered himself too young for the role, it was Connery's turn to shave off his moustache and take his toupet and tuxedo for another mission with Martinis, girls and fights.Diamonds Are Forever was the first Bond movie of the seventies and wanted to leave the sixties formula of cold-war-fiction behind - the problem was that the producers didn't know where to move. The whole plot is ridiculous, boring, lame and just another repetition of the Blofeld-wants-to-conquer-the-world-story without any new ideas. So Bond hunts Blofeld and a pack of diamonds around the world, but no one really knows whats going on.The settings - South Africa, Amsterdam and the United States - are not as well photographed as in the previous movies. While You Only Live Twice (1967) and On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) took much time to show the best sides of Japan and Switzerland and to introduce the local settings and culture to the audiences, the places in Diamonds are just superfluous. Images of South  African gold mines and the city of Amsterdam are just short postcard views, as well as the setting of the Californian desert. You don't see as much of the fascinating city of Amsterdam (e.g. the canal streets) as in the Bond-rip-off Puppet On A String, an Alistair McLean thriller adaption that was filmed at the same time.The action sequences are mainly boring, and a car chase on a parking place looks rather like a scene from an old Keystone Cops comedy. The story itself has no logical progression and no real tempo at all, but is often interrupted by senseless other scenes. There are also too many stupid slapstick and comedy elements involved, but nearly no thrills and suspense.The worst about this movie is the acting - apart from Connery, there is just a second-class cast in this movie. Charles Gray's Blofeld is not menacing at all and can't compete with Donald Pleasence's and Telly Savalas' Blofeld performances. Jill St. John is a dreadful and stupidly acting Bond girl, and Norman Burton's Felix Leiter looks rather like a shopping clerk. There is an offending couple of gay killers and a funny, but senseless couple of wrestling amazon girls.The positive points about Diamonds are not many too mention. Connery's performance is good as ever and rescues the film from a complete disaster. There is also a brilliantly edited fighting scene between Bond and a henchman in an elevator in Amsterdam. The theme was sung by Shirley Bassey for the second time after Goldfinger, but hasn't got the impact and style of that classic Bond tune. John Barry's score is fine, but has too many repetitions of the Bond and 007 themes from previous movies and also contains some dull comedy tunes that rather fits into a Disney movie.It's hard to believe that Goldfinger director Guy Hamilton was responsible for this disappointing Bond adventure that cannot reach the quality and style of the first six 007 missions. Hamilton also directed the following two parts of the series which were as bit better and went into new directions - Live And Let Die (1973) and The Man With The Golden Gun (1974) featuring Roger Moore. Fortunately he turned down the direction of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) - the first Movie who became a true Bond classic again for a very long time.

Still, it has some new ideas that work out pretty well.  The car chase through the streets of Las Vegas is both thrilling and inventive and the same (perhaps even more since it's also very funny) goes for the moonbuggy chase.Sean Connery proves (again) to be the absolute best Bond-actor of all time.  With him this film also provides the usual amount of beautiful women, exceptional stunts done with unique-looking tools invented by Q and a few funny one-liners to spice up the script a bit.  Typically Bond-films, there's also a small number of well-liked villains who all try to kill the same person; namely James Bond.It's a good thing that Blofeld (who returns after his appearances in You only live twice and On her Majesty's secret service) isn't the only baddie in this film, because that might have been somewhat boring.  All he does is petting his cat and giving orders to kill people and those things don't make him a very interesting character.  The actual killing is done by two goons who happen to be professional murderers and who truly give James Bond a hard time.Despite the somewhat weak and chaotic fighting scene at the end of this film, we are treated with a lovely surprise when one thinks it's all over.  The biggest let-down of Diamonds are forever is that there's absolutely no mentioning of James Bond's ex-wife Tracy who died in the previous movie.  This film should have been about revenge; it should have been somewhat darker than usual.  But instead, it seems as if James Bond has already forgotten about her.  Therefore, I think this film is sometimes too optimistic.Nevertheless, it's a good action-movie that proves (again) that they can make many more Bond-films like this.  My favorite scene is still Sean Connery being demolished by those two sexy, female gymnasts.  I guess James Bond expected a whole lot different when he first saw them.

This was Sean Connery's last 007 film with Eon Productions, the company co-founded by late producers Albert Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman (Connery of course reprised the James Bond role 12 years later in Never Say Never Again, which was from different producers and distributor). Diamonds Are Forever just proves that Connery was and always will be the best James Bond. This movie has the usual elements to be expected in a 007 adventure over-the-top villains, gorgeous women, helpful sidekicks, inventive gadgets, exhilarating locations, and splendid action. This time out Bond (for the third 007 movie in a row) faces off against the evil, white cat-loving Blofeld (this time portrayed by Charles Gray, after the role was played by Donald Pleasence in You Only Live Twice and Telly Savalas in On Her Majesty's Secret Service) while investigating mysterious activities in the world diamond market. 007 gets help from a nutty diamond smuggler named Tiffany Case (played in rather nutty fashion by Jill St. John), and Bond's longtime friend Felix Leiter (Normann Burton). Diamonds Are Forever takes us on a journey that begins in Amsterdam, then heads out to Las Vegas (where the middle portion of the movie is set), then climaxes on an oil rig in the Pacific Ocean. The Las Vegas setting in this movie is quite interesting since the town looked so different 30 years ago compared to today. Connery is great as always. St. John and Gray are fine but come off a bit silly as Bond's main squeeze and archrival, respectively. Lana Wood is good as the other Bond girl Plenty O'Toole, but isn't given much to do considering her very short screen time. Same can be said of current sausage king Jimmy Dean, who plays reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte (owner of the Las Vegas hotel and casino 'The Whyte House'). But Dean just about blows everybody away when he's on screen by giving the funniest, scene stealing performance in the film. Just listing to him talk made me laugh out loud. But that's O.K. It just makes Diamonds Are Forever all the more better. However, the goofiest roles in the movie go to Bruce Glover and Putter Smith who play those strange oddball assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. The usual 007 regulars are here too (Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Bernard Lee as M, and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny). All this adds up to an exciting and funny action adventure. Diamonds Are Forever is great fun, no question about it.***1/2 (out of four)  "},{"Title":"Trash, pure an simple.","Date":"9 October 2000","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  I am a very young James Bond fan, but a very big one.

In the end, however, Sean Connery was persuaded to return for a sixth outing as 007, although he does not seem to have enjoyed the experience. He is alleged to have stated that he would never again play James Bond- hence the title of the unofficial Bond film from twelve years later in which he played the role for the seventh and final time. James Bond is ordered by his boss, M, to investigate a diamond smuggling ring. M suspects that stolen diamonds are being stockpiled to depress the market, but the truth is far more sinister. SPECTRE, the international terrorist organisation featured in a number of earlier Bond movies, wants to diamonds to power an enormous satellite-mounted laser weapon with which they hope to hold the world's governments to ransom. (This plot was, essentially, to be reused in a later Bond film, Die Another Day). This was, in fact, the last film in the official series to feature SPECTRE, for reasons connected with the settlement of a lawsuit about the film rights to Ian Fleming's novels. As in the two previous Bonds, You Only Live Twice and OHMSS, the main villain is Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. Blofeld was played by a different actor in each film, Donald Pleasance, Telly Savalas and here Charles Gray, who had played a Bond ally in You Only Live Twice. Savalas had played the character as a crude American gangster, despite his rather incongruous obsession with proving himself a European Count, but Gray's interpretation is closer to Pleasance's, suave, superficially gentlemanly and cat-loving, but sinister. Both Pleasance and Gray give Blofeld an upper-class British accent, although according to Fleming he is half-Greek, half-Polish. The main Bond Girl here is Jill St. John's Tiffany Case. (Jill was both the first American and the first red-headed Bond Girl). Like a number of Bond heroines, Tiffany is originally an associate of the villains who switches sides, possibly when she realises that Blofeld has a nasty habit of killing off his own accomplices, presumably in order to cover his tracks. I know that Jill has come in for some criticism, but Tiffany is one of my favourite Bond Girls. Tough, feisty and resourceful, she was presumably created to be as different as possible from the doomed, tragic Tracy in OHMSS. A strong villain and a strong heroine are normally two important factors in the success of any Bond film. Yet despite my liking for both Gray and St. John, my view is that Diamonds Are Forever is far from the best of the series. Bringing back Connery was probably not the best idea that Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli ever had, because, although he is certainly an improvement on the inert Lazenby, this is his weakest performance in the series. He seems to have been more fixated on his million-and-a-quarter dollar fee than he was with playing his part, and looks bored and disillusioned. Some of the minor members of the cast are not really up to scratch; Lana Wood, sister of the more famous and more talented Natalie, shows just why she never went on to become a major star like her elder sibling. (Her character's name, Plenty O'Toole, must count as the second-most contrived moniker for a Bond Girl after Pussy Galore). Naming two ruthless female assassins Bambi and Thumper may have been intended as irony, but their names seem to be unfortunately, and doubtless unintentionally, appropriate; Lola Larson and Trina Parks come across as no more threatening than the lovable Disney cartoon characters whose names they bear. The gay hit men Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd may have seemed amusing in 1971, but in 2013 they just seem embarrassing. (At least, they were gay in Fleming's novel; in the movie, to keep the censors happy, their homosexuality is implied but never expressly stated). The plot has some similarities with that of Goldfinger- the two films also had the same director, Guy Hamilton- but is a bafflingly complex one, far more complex than it needs to be, and is often difficult to follow. Although short sequences near the beginning are set in South Africa or Amsterdam, the film's main location, Las Vegas, lacks the glamorous exoticism often associated with Bond movies. Apart from an exciting car chase through the streets of Vegas there are few thrilling action sequences, and the final scenes (set on an oil rig) are less spectacular than many Bond finales. Gray, St John and Shirley Bassey's great theme song mean that Diamonds Are Forever gets one star more than its lacklustre predecessor, but for me it will never be one of the Bond classics, certainly not in the same class as Goldfinger or You Only Live Twice. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Blofelds character","Date":"19 August 2011","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" The biggest problem with the character of Blofeld is that the film makers felt the need for him to be seen.

In Dr. No, Connery was charting in untested waters. It made him tight and wound up. In From Russia With Love, Connery had grown more comfortable in his role and appeared more relaxed than in the movie than its predecessor. With the solid performance of the two movies, Connery had every right to be confident about the Bond franchise and the confidence showed in Goldfinger and Thunderball. That confidence metamorphosed into a slight arrogance in You Only Lie Twice when he announced his intention to resign from the Bond movies.In Diamonds Are Forever, the arrogance became over bloated and Connery's performance was the nonchalance of a sleepwalker who knew that no matter where he walked, he was not going to fall off the cliff. His nonchalance could be understandable. George Lazenby and announced that he will no longer revive the role of 007. The James Bond owners were desperate. They needed someone to reaffirm the Bond fans that Bond was still alive. So they licked their wounds, went back to Connery and paid him US$1.7million which made him the highest paid actor of the year and earned him a spot in Guiness Book of Records as the highest paid actor. Connery also managed to convince them to bankroll two or three movies of his choice.With all this drama, it was no wonder that Connery's performance bordered on conceit. He hardly put in an effort. The energy that drove him in the previous movies was missing. And the plot itself was&#x85;(shudder!) Diamonds are being smuggled out of the British Mines in South Africa (the apartheid policy is conveniently ignored) at an alarming rate. Bond is sent to discover who is responsible and poses as a diamond smuggler to infiltrate the organization. While doing that, he has to contend with such flamboyant characters like the homosexual hit duo called Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, his beautiful handler-Tiffany Case, and a host of other unsavoury characters. Of course, it turns out that his old nemesis, Blofeld is behind the diamond smuggling intending to use the diamonds as a brilliant weapon that will hold nations to ransom.Of course, most Bond plots are completely ridiculous, and DAF falls into that category. But it was not just ridiculous, it was like a parody or spoof of Bond films. And the actors were just behaving like incompetent clowns trying hard to make us laugh.Charles Gray gives a witless performance as Blofeld. Jill St. John was the hapless female is distress who was working for the bad guys until she met Bond and started working for the good guys.All the other regulars were present, Bernard Lee as M, Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny, and always the scene stealer Desmond Llewywn as Q.The film still was a money maker, mainly based on fans excited to see Connery back in the role again.

In my opinion, that sixth film in the franchise isn't very good overall, and Lazenby's version of the character is forgettable. After that one, Connery returned for one last official Bond film before Roger Moore took over, which was this one, Diamonds Are Forever. While he still fit the role, this seventh official Bond adaptation, like the one before it, is somewhat disappointing.After it appears James Bond, Agent 007, has succeeded in killing Ernst Stavro Blofeld, he is soon sent on another mission. He is told about the South African diamond mines, and how diamonds from them have recently been mysteriously disappearing. It is suspected that this is a case of diamond smuggling, so Bond is sent undercover as a diamond smuggler named Peter Franks to Holland, where he meets another smuggler named Tiffany Case. He must gather information and find out who's responsible for this smuggling operation, and his investigations take him from Holland to America. Continuing the mission here, it turns out that Blofeld himself is once again the head of a sinister plot, and Bond faces a number of life-threatening situations as he once again tries to track down his foe! Like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, this seventh official Bond film is somewhat tedious, and that's not its only problem. Early in the film, when Bond is told about the South African diamond mines and how they work, we are shown a bunch of clips. This part is like watching an educational documentary, and I doubt too many people watch these films to see something like that. Right after that sequence, the film introduces two new villains, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and I found these characters maybe a tad annoying, even though they're apparently supposed to be funny, and Bruce Glover and Putter Smith put on rather poor performances as them. After that, there's some occasional excitement, such as the elevator fight, but there's certainly not enough of it. There's also a bit of humour, such as Tiffany Case saying My G*d! You just killed James Bond! to the man she doesn't know is actually him, the scene with Tiffany playing the water balloon game with a bunch of kids, and what Bond says after he manages to escape from a pipe. However, this movie is still usually boring, and may seem like an abnormally long two hours.Like many times before, I'm not 100% sure about my rating for this movie. I feel I might be able to give it a 6/10 instead of a 5 (there MIGHT be enough suspense in the film for that), but no higher, and the highest I've ever given a Bond flick is 9, which I gave to Goldfinger. (Speaking of Goldfinger, like that film, Shirley Bassey did the theme song for Diamonds Are Forever, but it's not as memorable as her first Bond theme.) However, like many other viewers, I still found this particular Bond flick disappointing, despite the return of Sean Connery. I would say most of the films in the official franchise starring Connery are decent, the best one probably being the classic Goldfinger, and I can see why he was so popular in the role, but it's a shame it had to end with this film, possibly the worst of Connery's official Bond films.

What starts as an investigation into some diamond smuggling eventually turns into another of SPECTRE's schemes for world domination by their number one, Ernest Stavro Blofeld played here by Charles Gray.After George Lazenby failed to ignite much passion in the role of 007, producer Albert Broccoli paid dear for Sean Connery's services to return as Bond. A nice two million dollar paycheck, probably it would be ten million in today's dollars. Connery was probably feeling very generous because he had finally scored in commercial hit in another role with The Anderson Tapes is immediately preceding film. Jill St. John and Lana Wood earn their wings as Bond girls, especially St. John who is a diamond smuggler being ripped off by SPECTRE. Of course the charm's of 007 were never more effectively employed in turning that woman's loyalties, or at least not since Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger. But Bond employs different skills to deal with Trina Parks and Lola Larson as Bambi and Thumper a pair of skilled lesbian assassins.I guess in recognition of the Stonewall Rebellion SPECTRE decided to go gay as well. And they weren't going to discriminate either, Putter Smith and Bruce Glover are a pair of gay males in the contract killing business and they're pretty good at it too. There's is the final encounter with 007 in Diamonds Are Forever.Jimmy Dean plays Willard Whyte a Howard Hughes like reclusive gazillionaire with Bruce Cabot as his chief assistant and voice to the outside world. How they figure in SPECTRE's plans you have to see the film for, but let's say that Howard Hughes's far flung empire is something to keep in mind. In fact I'm not sure why Hughes didn't sue Cubby Broccoli.Diamonds Are Forever marked the farewell movie role for Bruce Cabot. In his last years Cabot could always get work with John Wayne, Diamonds Are Forever marks one of his few non-Wayne films he was in.Like From Russia With Love and You Only Live Twice, this film also has to do with yet another scheme for SPECTRE to gain control of outer space from the super powers. It's not near as good as the first one and Goldfinger which are my two favorite Sean Connery Bond films, but the 007 cult around the world should be pleased with this film.

Basically the premise is this. Bond is called in to investigate a diamonds smuggling ring and, of course, this being Bond this is more than some two bit gangsters and the whole thing is controlled by SPECTRE, who as usual are hell bent on holding the world to ransom.Actually Diamonds starts off very well, with Bond tracking down Blofeld, who as you remember from On Her Majesty's Secret Service had Bond's wife gunned down. The teaser scene where Bond brutally extracts Blofeld's location from Blofeld's associated and where he kills off Blofeld's double and someone who is apparently Blofeld ( but isn't as the real Blofeld is in Las Vegas) is as good as anything in a Connery Bond, but then the film descends into some kitschy, camp farce where Charles Gray's Blofeld is about as threatening as Dick Emery.It is not that this is a terrible film that would be nominated for a Golden Raspberry, and certainly box office takings suggested it was popular back in the day, it's just such a letdown considering Sean Connery was first class in his previous Bond films. Apart from Connery looking hacked off and overweight and Charles Gray's camp Blofeld, Jill St John is completely useless as Tiffany Case, possibly the worst Bond girl ever, and what are we to make of the camp assassins Kidd and Wint, who are about as convincing as Laurel and Hardy? However, one unlikely scene makes up for all these useless characters, Bambi and Thumper, two female bodyguards who decide to give the overweight Bond a real beating in a penthouse.

DAF is just an excuse for Bond to say some corny bad jokes which don't evoke laughter but make the audience cringe in their seats. The real joke is on the Bond fans who would have gone to see this movie in the cinema expecting a great Bond movie(my heartfelt condolences to those who did). DAF was seen as Connery's comeback, after YOLT Connery decided not to do another Bond movie and the producers had to find someone else to fill his shoes and George Lazenby. In my opinion Lazenby is severely underrated as Bond. After OHMSS the producers persuaded Connery to do another Bond movie. After DAF he quit again and Moore stepped into his shoes and Connery made another debut in Never Say Never Again in 1983, which is not an official Bond movie and Octopussy was released in the same year.The producers followed up the classic OHMSS the only way the Bond producers can, with a truly despicable Bond movie that had none of the brilliance of it's predecessor movie. DAF in a way doesn't feel like a Bond movie for me because it lacks the thrills that the rest of the Bond movies had. Even the bad Bond movies had one or two thrilling sequences. For instance in Die Another Day, which is widely regarded as the worst Bond movie there was the opening sequence.In the opening sequence of DAF,which is more of a continuation from OHMSS sees Bond on the hunt for Blofeld who was responsible for the death of Bond's wife Tracy(Blofeld killed her when they were on the way to their honeymoon at the end of OHMSS). Bond eventually finds Blofeld and he thinks he has succeeded in killing him. Then Bond is sent on another mission, to investigate a smuggling operation and find out who's behind it. He does that by taking the identity of a man called Peter Franks. When he does finally find out who is behind the smuggling operation he is shocked to discover that it is no other than Bond's arch Nemesis Blofeld himself. It's hard to study a movie like DAF objectively, I can think of mostly negative points. I suppose the moon buggy sequence can count as a positive as it is easily the best thing about it. The Shirley Bassey's theme song is bearable so I think that counts as a positive. Onto the negatives, now where shall I start?. First of all there was Connery's frankly half hearted performance as Bond. Then there is the flimsy plotting, half of the time I was struggling to understand what was going on. Secondly the change of tone, from action to comedy doesn't work, particularly not in a Bond movie. Next there was a poor Bond girl in the form of Jill St John. Then there is the awful villains, there was Mr Kitt and Mr Wint who are easily some of the worst villains in the history of Bond. Then there was Charles Gray who is appalling miscast as Blofeld. This is a real shame because Blofeld is easily my favourite villain and he is given such gross misjustice here. Coincidentally Charles Gray was also in YOLT in a cameo as Henderson. Usually I find a redeeming quality in all the Bond movies, even the bad ones but I am well and truly stumped when it comes to DAF. There is the moonbuggy sequence but that is mildly entertaining and can't save the movie single handedly. I would go as far as saying DAF is a real Bond disaster and none of the bad Bond movies can even come close to topping the awfulness of it. If only I could erase the Bond travesty that is DAF from my memory and pretend there are only 21 Bond movies.

I was never very keen on On Her Majesty's Secret Service, finding it overlong and extremely over-rated. However, the original Bond, Sean Connery, was persuaded to play Bond one more time in 1971, for Diamonds Are Forever. This would be his last official Bond film, excluding the dire Never Say Never Again in 1983, which was not made by the same producers. I feel, however, that Diamonds Are Forever was not a fitting swansong for Connery and, quite frankly, I regard this film as an embarrassment. This film really began the 1970s era of silly Bond films and was even worse than most of Roger Moore's Bonds, in my opinion. If you think that you know the meaning of campy, then Diamonds Are Forever will make you think again. Basically, there is very little that this film got right. The character of Blofeld was played this time by Charles Gray, who had previously appeared in You Only Live Twice as an ally of Bond. However, the part where he appeared in drag made me physically cringe and his Blofeld was about as intimidating as a wet lettuce. The characters of the hit men, Wint and Kidd, weren't much better and the fact that their appearances were accompanied by a musical wolf-whistle just made me cringe even more. People have said that the Bond girl, played by Jill St. John was special, but I didn't find her particularly sexy or attractive and the Plenty O' Toole character felt out of place in a Bond film too. To make matters worse, Connery is at his most disinterested in this film as well and he looks thoroughly bored throughout the whole film. The only good thing about Diamonds Are Forever is the title song, which at least gives it some redemption, but not much. To sum up, there is absolutely no reason to see this film, even if you are a completist Bond fan. You honestly won't miss a thing if you don't watch it. I have never been a fan of the next Bond film, Live And Let Die, but at least that had some entertainment value. Diamonds Are Forever is, without doubt, Connery's worst Bond film and one of the worst in the entire franchise. Only consider watching this in extreme desperation, or if you want to ridicule it. It is a total failure on almost every level. Connery, you should have been ashamed.

Unfortunately, he had been living the good life and wasn't in great shape; not to mention, his hairpiece was not issued by Q, this time. Where Bond was previously deadly, with the occasional twinkle in his eye, he was now dropping jokes left and right. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the comic moments in the Bond films, usually, but they are better in small doses.The film teases us with a return to form, as Bond is on a violent rampage to find Bloefeld. At first, we only here him as he assaults one contact after another. Then, we get a glimpse and it takes some of the wind out of the sales. Connery is noticeably older and softer, and his hairpiece isn't very convincing. Had that been a plot point, like in Never Say Never Again, it might not have been a detriment. Unfortunately, you are asked to accept that this is still the same man who fought brutal battles with the likes of Red Grant and Oddjob. That isn't helped when we see him getting his head handed to him by Bambi and Thumper, or having trouble with Wynt and Kidd.The film is played heavily for laughs, but still manages some great stunt sequences, though they are even more outlandish than before, with the car chase through Las Vegas and the moon buggy escape. The final assault on the SPECTRE oil platform returns to the form of YOLT, minus the ninjas.The cast is a bit more odd than in the past, starting with Jill St. John. She is definitely a different love interest, with a wisecracking tongue and more self-assured manner (it was the era of women's lib). Despite that, she really doesn't have much to do, apart from sleeping with Bond and waiting for rescue. Not quite up to Tracy's standards.Charles Grey is a definite poor choice for Bloefeld. He is quite charming and menacing, but Bloefeld has been previously introduced as a cold hearted mass murderer; a calculating killer. Grey has too much of a sense of humor and would have been better suited to play a new villain. The character goes beyond recovery once he appears in drag.As for the rest of the cast, they are pretty forgettable, apart from Jimmy Dean's drawl and Lana Wood's presence. Wynt and Kidd never seem that scary, just weird. It's a shame, as Bruce Glover could have been a real psycho with a better script to work from.The film is pure farce, but at least it's fun. Unfortunately, there was no going back from this formula for years. Even the more serious films, like For Your Eyes Only and Goldeneye, suffer from jokey stunts, with things at their worst under Roger Moore (at least he was at home with the comedy). This one is the one you just kind of watch if thee is nothing better, laughing once in a while, shaking your head once in a while. It isn't the worst Bond film, but it will never appear on anyone's best list.

The movie was criticized of being too dark, too serious and not having Sean Connery. So the producers thought that the best thing to do would be to make the next Bond movie more in tone with Goldfinger.The movie does start rather seriously, with James Bond mercilessly hunting down and, seemingly, killing his archenemy Blofeld. After the great intro though, the movie just kind of pretends On Her Majesty's Secret Service never happened and goes to a completely different direction. Bond is assigned to investigate diamond smuggling from Africa to Europe and ultimately to USA. Bond pretends to be a smuggler and teams up with Tiffany Case to smuggle diamonds from Amsterdam to Las Vegas. There he finds Blofeld to not only be alive but also using the diamonds for his new sinister plan.Diamonds Are Forever really wants to be another Goldfinger. It has the director of Goldfinger, Guy Hamilton, back and Shirley Bassey is again singing the main theme. Again Bond is investigating smuggling only to learn villain is planning something worse, and again the main Bond girl is a bad girl with a good heart. However, this is a far cry from Goldfinger. The plot is all over the place, characters flat and/or uninteresting and the humor at times feels really forced.Having received some bad advices from his agent, George Lazenby refused to reprise the role of 007. The producers decided they had to get Sean Connery back. Connery, in an attempt to scare the producers off his back, agreed for a salary that at the time was astronomical. Producers however paid him the asked sum and Connery returned. While he does still perform the action scenes, especially the elevator struggle, with dignity it's obvious Connery doesn't take the film as seriously as the previous Bond movies. Other times he is treating it like a joke, being even more wisecracking than before, or he stays in background waiting for the lunch break.Jill St. John is nice to look at, but her character Tiffany is incredibly hard to like. She never comes across as anything other than gold-digger who only watches after herself. Charles Gray is a good choice for Blofeld, but the character has been reduced to a poor Saturday morning cartoon villain, a far cry from the evil mastermind of previous Bond films.This is also the last time Blofeld acts as Bond's main antagonist. Due to copyright problems the filmmakers couldn't use Blofeld and SPECTRE in films anymore. Considering how they had been villains in nearly every Bond film so far, I consider Diamonds Are Forever to be an end for an era in Bond series.Now, I do have to admit, if you don't expect too much and you don't watch it right after On Her Majesty's Secret Service, then this can be pretty entertaining film. It does have its moments, like one heck of a car chase scene and two very memorable gay assassins, so there is entertainment value here. Plus John Barry still delivers great score. But all in all, Diamonds Are Forever is one of the sillier Bond movies made. And that's saying a lot considering Roger Moore wasn't here yet.

I know I was rather enthusiastic with this entry before, and I actually remember loving it the first time I saw it. But this final entry for Sean Connery has aged poorly over the years of not seeing it. While there are still a number of things I liked about it, there are moments that made me cringe this time around. Connery, who accepted the role only because he was getting paid big-time, is actually the best thing about this entry. As usual, he IS James Bond, with all the charms we know and love from him. And another, Blofeld's (This time, played by Charles Gray) ridiculous plot of using theft diamonds to power a laser is typical Bond movie hokum - another over-the-top plot for world domination and extortion. Good action and chase sequences at least prevent it from being boring. The title song was pretty good too (sung by the one and only Shirley Bassey).But sadly, there are all too silly and mostly dull moments in DAF. Bond girl Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) remains one of the most annoying of the Bond girls (Lana Wood also appears as an even more thankless Plenty O'Toole). Elements such as Bond pitted against two sexy acrobatic women named Bambi and Thumper (!); an obligatory nod to a sillier and more comedic tone; and those two homosexual assassins (Putter Smith as Mr. Kidd and Bruce Glover as his sidekick Mr. Wint) are all dated now. But perhaps the biggest disappointment I had was Blofeld. Excellently portrayed in the first two movies he was in (though I should also note that he was so much more sinister in the earlier entries when his face is yet to be revealed), is reduced to an even more campy villain (he even disguises himself as a woman in one scene!). And by the way, what the heck happened to Bond's vendetta against Blofeld for the death of his wife? We were left dangling in the end of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE only to get Blofeld back as that same old baddie who plots to destroy the world's deadliest weapons if his demands are not met.While I still did enjoy DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, chiefly to see one of Connery's final performances as 007, I now think it's one of the lesser entries in the long-running series. Though it's far from the worst (because at least, unlike MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN, it's not boring), it's easily one of the Bonds that haven't aged well throughout the years. Watchable, but hardly Bond's finest hour.Rating **1/2 out of 5.

This would be the last official James Bond film to star Sean Connery, and would be the sixth time the film featured Connery as the title character. It is somewhat a bittersweet ending to Connery's legacy since the film's campy elements seem like they would be more at home in Roger Moore's series of Bond films and not the semi-serious realm of the Connery film. I wouldn't have suspected the director of the classic Goldfinger to come back with such a campy entry in the series.The film is very fun to watch and probably has some of Connery's best comic one-liners (It seems you've caught me with more than my hands up) and is amusing to watch, but it suffers in so many other aspects. It really does usher in the 70s Bond before Moore even enters the picture and whether that's good or bad is up to the viewer to decide. If you are a fan of the Roger Moore Bond films you will probably like Diamonds Are Forever, but if you're expecting a more serious, Connery Bond film on the level of Thunderball or Goldfinger you'll most certainly be disappointed. Even though Connery stars this really is essentially the first Moore Bond film.That being said I found this movie very entertaining, if not up to the standards of Connery's other five films. Diamonds Are Forever may be a dopey film in premise, but it's an incredibly amusing film that you should just go along with.If you don't want campy Bond just avoid this movie, but if you're like me and enjoy most of the Bond films you will probably enjoy the lunacy that is Diamonds Are Forever.

Sean Connery's swan song to 007 hit mid-stride in this mediocre effort.Bad hair piece, slightly out of shape and just barely wanting to be there, Connery accepted the return role for the astronomical contract (which he used to start his children's charitable foundation) and not just to make George Lazenby forgettable.Lazenby starred in Connery's desired role of 'OHMSS', which a tired and fed-up Sean passed up. The Aussie newcomer worked, but imploded himself out of the role. Connery was brought back 'the original and the still the best', but not in a better film. Sean would have been far better off using 'OHMSS' as his exit vehicle and dumping 'Diamonds', instead of vice-versa.Short on good plot theories and long on yet another Blofeld, the story loosely uses the aloof Howard Hughes as it's back-story, the aviator still a mystery and monopoly in Vegas at the time.Utilizing Bond's first 'car chase' (Steve McQueen's 'Bullit', impacting cinema history) up and down Fremont Street, the film winds it's way across the globe and 007's distracted revenge as he saves the world.Connery's unofficial effort in 'Never Say Never Again' for Warners a decade later, saves his 007 reputation where this film, otherwise, would have damaged it.Bring the popcorn, but a bathroom break is allowed.

First it throws away the opportunity it had to capitalize on the brilliantly brutal and genuinely sad ending to the excellent previous Bond entry, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, by basically making a joke (several jokes, actually) out of it, and reducing Bond once again to a wisecracking, ultra-suave cartoon character. Then, for the rest of the film it's one cheesy line after the other. Did the screenwriters even bother to work at this? This is without question the hokiest of the Connery Bond films. It's just not funny at all, and features a monstrosity of a plot which is utterly ludicrous from start to finish. Is there anything here besides ultra dumb 'science fiction' and inconceivably lame jokes, and not in the charming way much of the sexual punning in the better entries come off, just overly silly and bad comedy. Well, Sean Connery is back, but this is nowhere near the quality of his past performances (I even liked his often criticized turn in You Only Live Twice). As a matter of fact, he just sleepwalks through the whole movie, and seems awfully cheery for a guy who lost his wife not all that long ago. On Her Majesty's Secret Service earned more than $500 million internationally when adjusted for inflation, which shows that people did generally enjoy it in spite of the negative media surrounding Lazenby's (admittedly idiotic) idea to quit the role. So why did the writers and producers choose to dumb the next entry down to a point where the hardly intellectual On Her Majesty's Secret Service looks like an avant-garde masterpiece of philosophical film-making in comparison? Diamonds are Forever is seriously, seriously dumb and obviously made for adolescents or those with an adolescent mindset. Hell, the premise is that Blofeld wants to build a giant laser satellite with diamonds. There's also an obvious increase in nudity and sex here, which I wouldn't mind if it wasn't so obviously and haphazardly shoehorned into the movie to draw crowds, which again begs the question of why the producers thought the movie needed that considering the financial success of the previous entry.Dumbed down and sexed up, Diamonds are Forever is a poor send-off for Connery, who barely shows any interest in the role at all in his final performance before Never Say Never Again, but THAT is a whole other story.3/10 "},{"Title":"I don't like the fact of a bold bond girl ! ! !","Date":"28 September 2007","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" Diamonds Are Forever is a 1971 spy film.

As a Bond Fan, I am somewhat mixed about the film. There are times when it is good. However, there are times when its annoying and bad. As a separate Bond film, this might have been a good movie. But for the last Bond film of Connery's turn, it is a letdown. It is quite ironic that this film had some of the problems that were exhibited in You Only Live Twice.First of all, there is not a good villain in Diamonds. Donald Pleasance was no better than ok as Blofeld in YOTL. However, Charles Gray is not much better, in fact hes worse. There is nothing memorable about this Blofeld at all. Also, the scenes with the satellite blowing things up are downright bad. The special effects are horrible. If Diamonds Are Forever had been done after Star Wars, these scenes would probably have been improved. Moonraker was definitely not the best bond film, but the space special effects were quite good. Some of the action scenes were not particularly exciting. I am talking about the one with the moon vehicle(was that supposed to be funny?) and also the ending was not exciting either. The one impressive action scene (and yes it is pretty good) is the car chase around Las Vegas. It is easily the most exciting scene in the film.  Despite what some people have said about his performance, I found Sean Connery to be excellent here. In fact, he was one of the best parts about the film. However, the same cannot be said about Jill St. John. She is attractive but at times she was downright annoying as Tiffany Case. Lana Woods did not have much screentime and that is good because she was damn near annoying as St. John was. The gay assassins were irritating and pointless. One of the strangest casting choices was Jimmy Dean as Willard Whyte. Dean does not give a terrible performance, but its not exactly a good one either. He does deliver a one-liner well(Fire him). Despite the underwhelming conclusion to Connerys turn as Bond, it is not all bad. Diamonds is not really a bad film, it is a well-paced film but Connery deserved a better ending. Nevertheless, Diamonds is decent entertainment that could have and should have been better. I cannot fully recommend it but Bond fans should see it.

Not American enough for its American funding partners at United Artists, Bond was, prior to the Scots' resigning in the lead role, to be more Stateside friendly than before which at one point may have meant an American Bond in addition to US locations and supporting cast.

All right, let's get down to the point. In Diamonds Are Forever, Bond investigates a diamond smuggling operation and eventually finds out that Ernst Stavro Blofeld is associated with it as well, although he thought he killed him in the beginning. The movie starts a little more differently than the others, with the first scene showing Bond beating up a guy and asking for the location of Blofeld. He eventually finds his cloning station and kills Blofeld by pushing him into a boiling pool of mud. This was a pretty good way to start the film, but it's too short and is sort of forgettable. Shirley Bassey contributes her second theme song, which is easily one of the best. The rest of the film kicks off mainly with Bond impersonating smuggler Peter Franks while getting the location of the diamonds and Wint and Kidd giving the diamonds to associates and killing them afterwards. Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) was not the most stunning Bond girl. The award for hottest Bond woman goes to Paris Carver (Teri Hatcher) from Tomorrow Never Dies. But John was still pretty and was a very cool and even threatening character at first. However, that personality wears off as she gets dumber and more helpless as the film goes on. Although Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are very offensive, they still make good henchmen. There are also plenty of good lines (Named after your father perhaps?). The action such as the moon buggy chase is a little silly, but it's still OK. Overall, DAF is a very solid movie for almost the whole time. However, the good flow of the film slightly wears down towards the end. Although I love big battles in James Bond movies, the fight on the oil rig in this one is kind of boring. It mainly just takes the two previous films, You Only Live Twice and OHMSS, and combines their much better ending battles. To make matters worse, the explosion effects in this film are INCREDIBLY LAME!!!!!! If this had won any awards for best special effects, I would have conked myself on the head with a softball bat to make sure I wasn't in some kind of dream. The dialogue also gets really dumb too (All of your troubles are behind you. and She had such nice cheeks.), and Guy Hamilton spent way too much time filming Tiffany Case's butt. BLECH! I hope we never see that again. Norman Burton did a pretty bad job of playing Felix Leiter and is the worst Leiter of them all (One review here stated that he looked like a shopping clerk. I'd have to disagree He looks more like a used car salesman.). I think the main reason I'm saying all this is because the film seemed to jump to the ending too quickly, which disappointed me. But even with an extra ten minutes of good scenes in between, the ending would still be bad. Bond's disposal of Wint and Kidd on the cruise is very funny and concludes the film well though. All in all, Diamonds Are Forever is not the four star movie it came close to being, but it's still a solid entry and is at least worth a look. But it's not the most underrated Bond film. That award most likely goes to the brilliant Die Another Day (Reading all of those negative reviews for DAD today made me sick. Hey purists Sometimes things have to change!).My rating 3.5 out of 5.

Connery and Broccoli made five rather satisfying blockbusters before Connery originally called it quits; this movie is two movies too far. Worse still, the book is absolutely awful - Fleming could write very blazing stuff, but not always, and this is a prime example of his writing when he is not at all inspired.

After George Lazenby turned down the offer for this movie after his single 007 performance in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), the producers were desperately looking for a new Bond actor. As Roger Moore was bound to his Persuaders TV series at that time and another promising young actor, Timothy Dalton, considered himself too young for the role, it was Connery's turn to shave off his moustache and take his toupet and tuxedo for another mission with Martinis, girls and fights.Diamonds Are Forever was the first Bond movie of the seventies and wanted to leave the sixties formula of cold-war-fiction behind - the problem was that the producers didn't know where to move. The whole plot is ridiculous, boring, lame and just another repetition of the Blofeld-wants-to-conquer-the-world-story without any new ideas. So Bond hunts Blofeld and a pack of diamonds around the world, but no one really knows whats going on.The settings - South Africa, Amsterdam and the United States - are not as well photographed as in the previous movies. While You Only Live Twice (1967) and On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) took much time to show the best sides of Japan and Switzerland and to introduce the local settings and culture to the audiences, the places in Diamonds are just superfluous. Images of South  African gold mines and the city of Amsterdam are just short postcard views, as well as the setting of the Californian desert. You don't see as much of the fascinating city of Amsterdam (e.g. the canal streets) as in the Bond-rip-off Puppet On A String, an Alistair McLean thriller adaption that was filmed at the same time.The action sequences are mainly boring, and a car chase on a parking place looks rather like a scene from an old Keystone Cops comedy. The story itself has no logical progression and no real tempo at all, but is often interrupted by senseless other scenes. There are also too many stupid slapstick and comedy elements involved, but nearly no thrills and suspense.The worst about this movie is the acting - apart from Connery, there is just a second-class cast in this movie. Charles Gray's Blofeld is not menacing at all and can't compete with Donald Pleasence's and Telly Savalas' Blofeld performances. Jill St. John is a dreadful and stupidly acting Bond girl, and Norman Burton's Felix Leiter looks rather like a shopping clerk. There is an offending couple of gay killers and a funny, but senseless couple of wrestling amazon girls.The positive points about Diamonds are not many too mention. Connery's performance is good as ever and rescues the film from a complete disaster. There is also a brilliantly edited fighting scene between Bond and a henchman in an elevator in Amsterdam. The theme was sung by Shirley Bassey for the second time after Goldfinger, but hasn't got the impact and style of that classic Bond tune. John Barry's score is fine, but has too many repetitions of the Bond and 007 themes from previous movies and also contains some dull comedy tunes that rather fits into a Disney movie.It's hard to believe that Goldfinger director Guy Hamilton was responsible for this disappointing Bond adventure that cannot reach the quality and style of the first six 007 missions. Hamilton also directed the following two parts of the series which were as bit better and went into new directions - Live And Let Die (1973) and The Man With The Golden Gun (1974) featuring Roger Moore. Fortunately he turned down the direction of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) - the first Movie who became a true Bond classic again for a very long time.

At the time, most of the bond films I had seen had Roger Moore play the lead, and this was one of the first Sean Connery Bond films that I watched. Everyone said that he was the best, and when the first glimpse of him came in the pre-credits opening of the film (This opening is probably the best in the series next to GoldenEye), I was looking forward to seeing the master at work. But throughout the film I could not help thinking in the back of my mind that the only reason Sean was doing this particular Bond film was because of the overwealming amount of money they used to lure Sean back into the role after George Lazenby's one-hit wonder Bond in 'On Her Magesty's Secret Service'.The cinematography and stuntwork used 'Diamonds are forever' are so good, you could easily be mistaken for thinking this film was made in the late 80's or even the 90's (Not 1971 in which the film was made). The quality of the picture is just so much better than the two following films 'Live and Let Die', and 'The Man with the Golden Gun' (Although I did find those films much more enjoyable than this one). I suppose 'Diamonds' is a good movie as a whole, good plot I suppose and some great sequences, but personaly I feel this film dragged on at times. I am a Bond fan that craves action, and I feel that Rojer Moore delivered it better than Connery. But this assumption is based when comparing to this particular film. I am sure that the earlier Connery ones such as 'Thunderball' and 'Goldfinger' (which amazingly I am still yet to see, but want to as everyone thinks it is the best) are better than 'Diamonds'.Make your own assumption in who was the best Bond and which ones were the best movies, but to me personaly, 'Diamonds are Forever' is a bit low on my favourite Bond films list. Not as fun to watch as the Rojer Moore films, and not as original as the ealier Connery films.  For Fans Only.

These three installments not only have the same emphasis on humor, but have conclusions that are almost interchangeable.  In Diamonds, the story is all but wrapped up when Bond and the lovely Tiffany Case (the beautiful Jill St. John) are aboard an ocean liner where they are confronted by the two stereotyped homosexual assassins for a final burst of action.  In Live and Let Die, there is a similar wrap-up on a train, and in Man With the Golden Gun, another similar scene takes place, again, on an ocean liner.  There is very little memorable about Diamonds Are Forever--it represents a major decline from On Her Majesty's Secret Service--yet it has Connery, another terrific John Barry score, and, like I said, the beautiful Jill St. John.

Instead of picking one plot and sticking to it, this film turns into a bit of a camp mess. It's saving grace is that it's fun. There isn't much else to it than that!James Bond is hot on the trail of Blofeld, who murdered his wife. I have often wondered what would have been made of this film had George Lazenby stayed with the franchise. It could have been a far more personal mission of revenge. As it, this film gets lost in trying to do too many things. Is it about the revenge of his wife? Not entirely. Is it about Blofeld? A bit. Diamond smuggling? Here and there? Space? Yep, but just at the end. It even has the classic scientist who wants 'world peace', and yet another side story about a missing Howard Hughes type tycoon and two of the most bizarre henchmen in any film, let alone a Bond film. In a nutshell, this is about Blofeld smuggling diamonds to make a space laser beam to destroy military establishments. But there is so much going on, with so many characters, that it simply never works. The lost and far-reaching plot, mixed with the overly camp humour, poor Bond girls and the feeling that Connery just didn't care make this a bit of a mess, that just happens to somehow entertain on some level. There are some great action scenes here and there, but in my mind, this is one of the poorer Bond films, with the exception of the great signature tune by Shirley Bassey. This could have and should have been so much more than it was. The producers needed to either focus on the diamond smuggling, or (as I think), they needed to make this a more personal Bond where Bond avenges the death of his wife. Had Lazenby stayed, I think it would have been different. He didn't, Connery came back, and it just didn't work out because they made it for the wrong reasons. I'm glad for everyone's sake that Bond moved on from Connery at this stage. Good for an afternoon with beer and crisps and a laugh, but not for anything else. 6/10.

He's got graying hair, crow's feet, and he's a bit chubbier. This Bond film takes a turn away from serious espionage and tries to add more slapstick comedy and fun action scenes. One example is a terrible scene where Bond gets away from the bad guys in a moon rover, or during the climax when he uses an escape pod containing Blofeld as a wrecking ball. The terrible characters of Wint and Kidd are in here, and their annoying conversations make one want to hit the Fast Forward button. Blofeld is terrible in this movie. When he first appeared in From Russia With Love when he first appeared, he was sinister, certainly a force to be reckoned with. He lost a lot of his evil in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and in this movie he actually dresses up in drag to trap Tiffany Case, something the original Blofeld would never do. The dialogue is cornier than any other Bond film so far, and so are the action scenes.The acting isn't very good. Charles Gray is a terrible Blofeld, and Jill St. John doesn't make a very good Bond girl.

No, it's not a total disaster (none of the Bond movies are complete flops) and this has its moments for the discriminating 007 fan, but after all something's got to linger near the basement when you're dealing with a series that's now going over 20 films (as of this writing). I'd start with a brief description of the plot, but therein lies the first problem -- this movie's everywhere, and it's pretty hard to understand. Let's just say it's got something to do with diamond smuggling and James Bond gets to tangle with his arch nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld -- and therein lies the second problem......one of the biggest mistakes in the Bond movie series is that the character of Blofeld has been played by so many different actors that it gets rather stupid trying to believe they're all one and the same. In earlier films the situation was handled best of all by leaving the notorious crime boss hidden in shadow, albeit for the fearsome sound of his foreign accented voice. Then we had Donald Pleasance suddenly embodying the official look of Blofeld in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE , followed by a later drastic change into Telly Savalas (aka Kojak) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Now in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER we're expected to believe that the formerly bald Blofeld has gained a full head of hair and yet another voice change as Charles Gray! Not to mention that Gray was already featured as another character a couple of films ago and is overly theatric as Blofeld here. Without going into the ending of the last film (ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE) we've been anxiously waiting for Bond to encounter Blofeld again, and when he does in this movie it's actually a rather friendly affair! Completely disappointing after the circumstances laid out in OHMSS, and quite a gyp.Other flaws -- the two side bad guys, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, are quite silly and among the worst in the series. Bruce Glover (as Wint) isn't that bad, but musician-turned-actor Putter Smith (as Kidd) is a waste. He had no acting experience and it shows every time we're subjected to his hippy face on screen (though he does get one good moment at the end aboard a boat). There's a car chase through the streets of the glitzy Las Vegas which is among the dullest you'll ever see, and I've saved the most important for last ... Sean Connery. In case you didn't know, Connery bowed out of the series two films ago, which is why we got stuck with the ineffective George Lazenby last time... but Connery was paid a huge sum of money (for the early '70s) to come back once more for DIAMONDS, and so here he is again -- but unfortunately, now he appears somewhat disinterested and too old for his brand of James Bond. It's a pity Sean didn't star in OHMSS instead, thus allowing Roger Moore to debut for DIAMONDS, as this type of comic book film was much more suited to Moore's humorous style. The silly character of Willard Whyte as portrayed by Jimmy Dean is also more suited to the Moore era. And Lana Wood sounds like she's never recited a line of dialogue in her life before when she first introduces herself to Bond as Plenty... Plenty O'Toole. You can also count the theme song Diamonds Are Forever as a series low point for me.So is anything exceptionally good in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER? Well, the pre-credits sequence is fun, Whyte's two fighting ladies Bambi and Thumper are a kick, and I kind of like Jill St. John as the new girl, Tiffany Case. There's a fight scene inside a small elevator that's pretty cool, and we do have Sean Connery back in the series for one last time, even if it is as an actor with a price and a noticeable desire to move on. **1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"An average Bond","Date":"26 May 2005","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" WHAT Happened!!!!!

The film wasn't completely terrible; it had it's good points. However, after OHMSS, my favorite of the Bond films, this film fails to live up to Majesty's high standards.Of course, one must keep in mind that at it's initial release, OHMSS was the second-lowest grossing Bond film, although not a box-office failure. Audiences didn't bother giving the film a chance, instead complaining of the absence of Sean Connery. The press didn't help, as they gave a false image of George Lazenby who, after bad advice from his agent and supervisor, backed out of the role of 007. Sean Connery was lured back into this film with his salary higher than the budget of Dr. No, but this couldn't have been a worse farewell performance for him. His age isn't as obvious as some have said; for the most part, he looks the same as in You Only Live Twice. But his performance isn't right. At the beginning of the film, he is hunting down Blofeld, beating up everyone who has a lead on him until he gets information. He finds his nemesis changing his appearance yet again and creating a double of himself through plastic surgery. Bond stops the procedure and supposedly kills his nemesis. But WHY is he hunting Blofeld? The logical answer is the murder of his wife in the last film; there are several indications. Bond is dead-set on finding Blofeld, M states that 007 has been focusing on nothing else, and when Moneypenny asks for a wedding ring, rather than smiling and immediately replying, Bond looks rather disturbed by the comment. But it is never stated why Bond is after Blofeld.After Bond kills Blofeld, he goes to Vegas to stop a diamond smuggling operation. The people who handle the diamonds are killed off by homosexual killers Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. I had no problems with them being homosexual as it is not the most obvious thing in the movie. But when Bond kills Peter Franks and Tiffany Case, the new Bond girl, thinks Franks is James Bond, why is she so surprised. Bond is a SECRET agent from BRITIAN! So far the only people who know Bond is a 00 agent are those who have secret links and friends in high places (the only ones like that are SPECTRE and Draco, Tracy's father.) I don't think Felix Lieter would leak information like that into the public of a country like America. And speaking of Felix, he is totally out of character in this film. Rather than being the understanding friend of James that he was in the other films, he now is too serious and business-like. Tiffany Case, and indeed, every other woman in this film, have no personality and are just appendages to the story line. After a woman like Tracy in OHMSS, you'd think they would come up with women at least a LITTLE like the closest Bond girl to Tracy, Pussy Galore (I say Pussy because Bond said he'd never find another girl like Tracy.)And finally, Blofeld. He had three doubles, and the opening of the film has Bond kill two. He kills the other, and the real one is left alive. This Blofeld is much more of a whiner and more talkative then the calm, ruthless Blofeld of YOLT, or the charming, tough Blofeld of OHMSS. His plan will be copied twice in future Bond films, with a minor difference. Blofeld's satellite, encrusted with diamonds, is a laser that he uses to hold the U.S. for ransom, at what price I don't remember. The film's plot is rather dull and lacks the same kind of excitement and lavish feel of previous Bond outings. The opening teaser should've been M, Q, and Moneypenny looking over 007's work since Tracy's death and finding a lead on Blofeld, and THEN they could mix in the diamond smuggling with Bond's search for Blofeld. Donald Pleasance or Telly Savalas should've played Blofeld, and George Lazenby should've played 007. Q's hair went too white from OHMSS and DAF, when not even a year seems to have passed. And at the end, before the action starts, Tiffany sounds like she'll propose marriage, and Bond is in no way looking glum, uncomfortable, or with a look that says no, and there should be one on his face.The film does have it's good points, however. I did enjoy Willard Whyte. He's a good comedic character. So is Plenty O' Toole, even if she is annoying. And Sean Connery doesn't play the part right for a man after the one who killed his wife, but the way he plays it is good.This film was supposed to mark a turning point in the OO7 films. Rather than the ruthless, dark agent of Connery, the Roger Moore era of a light-hearted, witty Bond was coming, and this film was supposed to launch it. Instead, it isolates itself from the series and turns out dull. They should've done it in the style of OHMSS, and THEN let Live and Let Die introduce Moore and his era. This film gets a 3 1/2 out of 10.

The producers eventually convinced the original and greatest Bond, Sean Connery, to return one more time for 1971's Diamonds Are Forever (Connery would play Bond for the last time in 1984's Never Say Never Again, a thinly veiled remake of Thunderball, for another studio) before handing over the franchise to Roger Moore.That said, Diamonds Are Forever is definitely the weakest of the original Bond films starring Connery. Agent 007 hooks up with a ditzy smuggler (Jill St. John) as he links stolen diamonds to a plot by SPECTRE leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray) to build an orbiting space laser.Many Bond fans dismissed Lazenby and anything to do with OHMSS. Apparently, so did the makers of this movie. How much better this film would have been if it was about Bond getting personal revenge against Blofeld for what happened in OHMSS (those who have seen OHMSS know what I am referring to). Unfortunately, there is no reference at all to the events in the previous picture, and the plot follows the basic evil villain holds world ransom with super weapon formula instead. Connery's still the best Bond and knows how to make an entrance, but he looks noticeably older and less engaged than in his earlier efforts. OHMSS had a smart, classy, and capable Bond Girl in Diana Rigg's Tracy. Diamonds Are Forever has an annoying and bumbling Jill St. John as Tiffany Case and Lana Wood in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her walk-on as the aptly named Plenty O'Toole. Also appearing in the film are two agile female guards named Bambi and Thumper (I wonder what the folks at Disney thought?) and a pair of ambiguously gay assassins. Charles Gray is a strangely effeminate Blofeld (he even dresses in drag at one point) who lacks the bald head, as well as the diabolical menace, of Donald Pleasence or Telly Salvalas.Since the story is weak and formulaic, Diamonds Are Forever instead relies on the same campy jokes and pointless chase sequences that would later plague the Roger Moore era. It should also be noted that this was the last of the official Bond films that could feature SPECTRE due to complex copyright reasons, although an unnamed figure who was obviously supposed to be Blofeld appears in the opening of 1981's For Your Eyes Only.6 out of 10.

Bond unleashes a vat of stuff on a guy who was being made into a clone, and I guess he drowned in it, or something. And what was that that he aimed at Bond, a squirt gun? Not a very good opening, and the theme song, by the way, was also one of the worst of the entire series. And of course, as is the tradition with Sean Connery's James Bond, he is drinking within the first few minutes of the film. But soon after this, Bond ends up trading identities with a man named Peter Franks, and this is where it really starts to get interesting.Diamonds Are Forever deals with a villain (Blofeld, back for more) who is smuggling huge quantities of diamonds with the ultimate goal of using them to create a super powerful `laser' with which he plans to hold the United States hostage, demanding whatever ransom he wants. I don't think that they specified a dollar amount, but it was probably around &#145;one MILLION dollars!' While it is surprisingly entertaining the way that Bond switches identities, resulting in the belief that he is dead (but that mistake has been made before, hasn't it?), some things about the premise of this film bothered me. For example, for such a physically small quantity of diamonds being transported, I'm not sure I understand the need for the tremendously elaborate methods by which it is transported. They are stuffed into a teddy bear and awarded at a rigged carnival game, they're put into a dead man's coffin, cremated, and delivered in the urn, etc. Why don't they just throw them into the trunk of a car and drive them to where they're going? I guess it's because if they did that, there would be no movie.(spoilers) Once again, there is an abundance of ineffective day for night photography (which is seen in most of the early Bond films, and it never works), as well as plenty of bad acting and people getting killed who just should have known better. The guys in the helicopter that exploded early in the film, for example, died because of their own stupidity. Here's a lesson, if someone hands you a box and starts quickly backing away, it may be a good idea to achieve some distance from that box yourself. Also, the two inseparable thugs Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint delivered some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a Bond film, which increased the morbid satisfaction felt during their horrible deaths. Not only could they not act, but they spoke almost exclusively in clich√©s &#150; `If God had meant man to fly, he would've given him wings,' `Strange how everyone who touches the diamonds winds up dead.' Oh, and another thing - in one scene in the film, Bond is managing an escape, and he jumps into a `moonbuggy,' driving off to eventual safety. What the hell was going on there? Were they faking a moon landing? Making a movie? Or just waiting for James to come along and borrow their buggy to drive to safety? At any rate, the ensuing chase scene was entertaining enough, particularly the hilarious three wheelers. Despite all of the many shortcomings of this film, however, Diamonds Are Forever still stands as an above average Bond film. Sean Connery is just as effective as ever in the title role, and the story, while not wholly probable, was more realistic than some of the other films (see You Only Live Twice). Also, the ever-present one liners were better than usual, and every single one was better than every one-liner that Pierce Brosnan ever delivered. While they are clearly connected to the sexual innuendos that constantly surround Bond in his films, some of them are downright funny &#150; `Providing collar and cuffs match,' `That's a nice little nothing you're wearing. I approve!' and of course, after having been introduced to the beautiful Plenty O'Toole, `Named after your father, perhaps?'It's good to see that there was some thought put into the story for Diamonds Are Forever, but some parts were clearly not thought out at all. For example, there is a scene where the idiotic Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint drive out of a cave in the desert, and after they drive out, a door closes, covering the cave and making it look like just another piece of desert. Sure, the cave's opening is hidden, but there is also a road leading right up to it. Seems that the road might give something away. Also, when Bond finally gets to Willard Whyte's location, he pretty much stands still and lets a couple of scantily clad women smack him around for a little while.  And speaking of which, why are there women in bikinis all over the place? The vast majority of these costumes are completely unnecessary and only serve to lower this film to the level of the cheesy B-movie that relies on nudity to drive its bonehead plot. Luckily, the plot in this film is interesting enough to be able to overcome these things. This is also the film that made me think about starting a list of how many Bond films end with him on a boat at sea, after having obviously gotten the girl, which you know will happen from the moment you pick the film off the shelf at the video store. We know Bond's going to get the girl, but they could at least come up with a different way to end it. Overall, Diamonds Are Forever is a heavily flawed film, but it also has a great many strengths that revive interest and make it worth watching.

Nevertheless, it easily surpasses Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun. This time Bond discovers Ernst Stavro Blofeld has almost as many lives as his white cat. Blofeld's global criminal syndicate has been stockpiling diamonds and the Prime Minister wants British Intelligence to investigate. Of course, 007 has no idea Blofeld is behind the diamond smuggling ring because he iced the arch-villain in the entertaining pre-credit sequence which marked the return of Sean Connery after the debacle of On Her Majesty's Secret Service and one-time only Bond George Lazenby.United Artists had given Lazenby the boot, while Saltzman & Broccoli induced a paunchy Sean Connery to assay the role once more after he'd quit the series following You Only Live Twice. Indeed, everybody was concerned that the serious-minded but perhaps best Bond of all time&#x97;On Her Majesty's Secret Service had failed to attract audiences. They feared meant 007 might have lost his license to entertain. Diamonds Are Forever proved the cynics wrong as the franchise rebounded, but Connery didn't bounce back for Live and Let Die. Connery abandoned Bondage again, later to return in Never Say Never Again in 1983. Speaking of returns, actor Charles Gray who had appeared in You Only Live Twice as a British contact returned, but this time he played a foppish Blofeld in a khaki-type uniform jacket, smoking a cigarette in a holder.Indeed, many things about Diamonds Are Forever resemble Guy Hamilton's Goldfinger. The laser that nearly emasculated 007 turns into a larger laser with enough power to destroy submarines, missile silos, and above-ground missile launchers. Diamonds departs from the formula by having Bond and M discuss 007's latest mission with Sir Donald at the diamond ministry. This single scene after the title credits dovetails what might have been two scenes, the usual one in M's office and later in Sir Donald's office, into one scene. Hamilton had two scenes in Goldfinger where Bond received his assignment and then met with M and the Treasury people about gold. In Goldfinger, the villains held Bond hostage for most of the picture, but in Diamonds he spends most of his time undercover as a member of Blofeld's syndicate, helping smuggle the diamonds into America. Unlike Goldfinger, Q Branch provided Bond with no gadgets, but Q shows up briefly in the Las Vegas scene to equip Bond with a voice altering device like Blofeld had that enables him to masquerade as the world's richest hermit, Willard Whyte.Briefly, the British are worried somebody is stockpiling diamonds either to depress prices or perhaps blackmail the British. British Intelligence has traced a suspect, Peter Franks (Joe Robinson), who is going to a rendezvous in Amsterdam with Ms. Tiffany Case (Jill St. John of Tony Rome) who may have more clues about the case. British Intelligence arrests Franks and Bond impersonates him, meets with Ms. Case, learns he is about to earn his $50-thousand by smuggling a chandelier of diamonds into America. Meanwhile, Blofeld has dispatched two homosexual hit men, Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) and Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover of Walking Tall), to tidy up things by eliminating the people in the pipeline so nobody can trace them back to Blofeld. Franks escapes from his captors, reaches Amsterdam, and dies in a savage elevator slugfest with Bond who then swaps wallets with Franks. Tiffany searches Franks, covered in foam from a fire extinguisher, and looks shocked when she glimpses his Playboy membership card. Appropriately shocked, Tiffany exclaims, My God, you've just killed James Bond! Bond chuckles, It just proves no one's indestructible. You don't kill James Bond, Tiffany reprimands him, and sit around waiting for the cops to arrive. 007 conceals the diamonds in Franks' body and Ms. Case and he fly into Los Angeles with Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint on the same airplane shadowing their every move. Felix Leiter, posing as a customs official, meets Bond at LAX and watches while some mobsters load Franks' casket with the diamonds into a hearse. Bond rides with them to Las Vegas where the body is to be cremated. The funeral home removes the diamonds and puts them in an urn for 007 to leave for the next member of the pipeline. Wint and Kidd bash 007 over the head, stick him in a casket and send him off to be incinerated. Comedian Shady Tree and the funeral home director rescue Bond moments before being immolated and curse him for leaving them with phony diamonds. Bond goes to Las Vegas, soaks in a tub at a casino motel, and awaits the arrival of Q and the diamonds.After the diamonds reach America and go to Willard Whyte's research labs, Diamonds seems more like an adaptation of Dr. No and You Only Live Twice. Bond receives the surprise of his life when he discovers that not only is Blofeld alive but also that the criminal mastermind has doubles everywhere with duplicate cats. Eventually, Bond rescues the real Willard Whyte (country and western crooner Jimmy Dean) who Blofeld has held hostage. Blofeld used an ingenious device that makes his voice sound precisely like Whyte's voice. Blofeld has taken over Whyte's global network and holds the man hostage. Since nobody has seen Whyte for five years&#x97;the character resembles Howard Hughes&#x97;he makes the perfect kidnap hostage. Eventually, Blofeld is able to launch a satellite with a laser and threatens to destroy an American city if Washington, D.C., doesn't cough up bucks galore. As for the serious tone of the previous Bond, the writers decided to make Diamonds much more tongue-in-cheek, almost to point of parody. Bond destroys Blofeld's newest base on an oil drilling platform and disables the laser satellite. But does he really kill Blofeld? You'll have to watch For Your Eyes Only to know.

But instead we're stuck with Connery returning for one last film in his final appearance as 007 and Charles Gray (!!!) as Blofeld. A bit of a weird casting choice since Gray already played a completely different character in You Only Live Twice. He even has hair! The story has Bond attempt to foil Blofeld's latest evil schemes by tracking bunch of conflict diamonds from Africa to Las Vegas. It turns out that Blofeld needs them to power an orbiting death-ray or whatever and obviously Bond can't allow that.Despite this far-fetched plot, it does play down the usual eccentricities of the Bond franchise. There are no silly gadgets and no fancy cars. But their IS a very cool, red 1971 Ford Mustang. I always thought that a muscle car in a Bond movie would be an interesting edge and here Bond uses one to out-run the cops in Vegas' Fremont Street. A pretty cool scene. Another cool scene would be Bond's 'elevator trip' to Blofeld's penthouse office. A true moment of dangerous espionage indeed.I don't like a couple of elements in DAF however. The two furiously gay hit men out to whack everyone who come into contact with the diamonds really got on my nerves and I found them a bit disturbing. I believe they were intended as un-PC comic-relief, but that's not how I took it. The character of Plenty O'Toole (a stupid, stupid name unless she's a pornstar) is totally pointless and scenes cut from the film make her final fate utterly senseless. The chopper attack on the oil rig is kind of lame too and Blofeld's fate isn't disclosed.Never mind though, there's still Plenty O'Humor (sorry, I couldn't resist) and some good action to balance out its shortcomings. Trouble is, it only ends up being an above-average entry in the series. Keep a lookout for Captain Spaulding as one of the funeral home thugs.

It's unfortunate that the producers felt they had to constantly outdo themselves with each successive movie, straying further and further from their source. The book Diamonds are Forever is a taught, gritty thriller that would have made a swell noir in its day. The films always struggled with fidelity when it came to adaptation. Only Goldfinger and, largely, On Her Majesty's Secret Service were faithful to (and, in the case of Goldfinger, actually improved upon) their source. Dr. No and From Russia With Love suffered by their inclusion of SPECTRE. Thunderball needlessly complicated its plot. And You Only Live Twice began the unfortunate trend of picking only basic elements from the source and throwing them into a whole new fabrication. Diamonds are Forever suffers this fate, and not to its benefit. It starts with a diamond smuggling pipeline and brings Bond to America to face a cadre of colorful thugs, as the novel did, but departs wildly by replacing the mob with SPECTRE as the chief villain. From there it follows the standard formula the Bonds have more or less continued since. But it suffers for more reasons than that. The script lacks wit, the performances lack conviction, the stunts are dry, the picture is flat. And everybody seems to be sweating. Connery is heavier and relaxed, but he's completely charmless. Charles Gray is simply wrong for Blofeld (they've never really gotten this character right on screen). I suppose Jill St. John is okay as Tiffany Case. She could have been a little tougher. She started out right, but descended into hapless damsel. Wint and Kidd, ruthless killers in the novel, are played for laughs. Even John Barry's score feels listless. It even regurgitates some cues from From Russia with Love (which would later reappear in Moonraker). Perhaps he was becoming as bored with the franchise as Connery had. The series would continue to bloat throughout the seventies before tightening up again in the eighties.If you're a completist it's worth watching, but probably not worth having on your shelf. Of course, when there's nothing else on TV a Bond film always fills the hole.

The true weaknesses of OHMSS was a strong script, believable characters, and a more three-dimensional Bond.  Bond fans, conditioned by the slow but steady descent from From Russia With Love to You Only Live Twice, had long ago pledged allegiance to plotless, artless action/spy films.  OHMSS was simply too good a film to be accepted as a Bond movie.  Fortunately, the producers gave the fans exactly what they wanted  Sean Connery in a dumb, poorly plotted, embarrassing excuse for a feature film.  Thus the Bond franchise was saved.There is not one good thing about this movie.  The script is awful.  Mr. Wynt and Mr. Kidd are the most absurd homosexuals I've ever seen on film (and yes, I've seen The Birdcage).  Jill St. John is horribly miscast, and if not for the numerous other flaws of the film, could have ruined it single-handedly.  Charles Grey makes a weak and boring Blofeld, but the script undermines (and actually derides) the character all the more.  The script never seems to be able to decide if it is pure camp or a tough-guy, gritty action movie.  Sean Connery's Bond is utterly the wrong vehicle for camp (though Connery himself excelled at the more consistent and unself-conscious camp of The Avengers).Diamonds are Forever marks the low point of the Connery era, and one of several low points of the franchise as a whole.  The Bond films frequently failed to achieve even a basic level of cinematic quality, but rarely has it produced a film as outright bad as this one.

In this case, however, I have to say the book is SO MUCH BETTER that the movie should be viewed only in a study in how NOT to make movies.  The book was enjoyable, the movie so over-the-top silly it nearly parodies itself (e.g. bikini-clad Tiffany and the automatic rifle). The plot blasts off into that Cold-War-comic-book technoterror stratosphere that dances on the brink of incredibly bad science fiction -- i.e. laser death rays and world domination. The worst trouble with this turkey is that it doesn't seem to know it should take itself lightly.  The Roger Moore era had its share of plots cooked up according to the same cheesier-than-macaroni recipe, but there was an overall ambience of escapist fun, and frankly Roger Moore's looks as well as his on-screen manner better suited that sort of light-hearted womanizing superman-gone-inspector-gadget Bond had already been made into in Diamonds Are Forever.  Connery, who could have been light-hearted and funny, was unfortunately directed to be the old Connery-style Bond and try to play this ludicrous mess seriously -- a grave mistake.None of Fleming's books got so silly, though taken as a complete series would stretch realism (Bond kept ticking through more lickings than a news-anchor pitchman's wristwatch.)  In this case, though, the novel has a particular authenticity even in the diamond smuggling and the rigged casinos, perhaps in part because of Fleming's real-world study of The Diamond Smugglers (not an exciting book, but a worthwhile read) and in large part because it had elements of the mundane and of the true human misbehavior that would not fit the feel-good commercial action/adventure genre.  (In the book,Tiffany has good reason to be a case -- and is a much more interesting one -- and is much less of a puff-ball bouncing about in a bikini for no better reason than the cheap titillation of the male audience.)If you want a good evening's entertainment, pick up the book and leave this turkey on the shelf.

Some - like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me and others - I would happily watch many times.Despite having the normal amount of gadgets, pretty women, funny wise cracks, etc., this film seemed to drag in parts. Some of the earlier Bond movies are a bit slower than the ones in the past two decades, but not all. Maybe it's the time period this was made. I have found very few films in the first half of the 1970s that didn't look and sound sleazy to me. This felt that way, too.Jill St. John looked pretty hot in her day, but looking at her now as he looked then, I can't say that. Now she looks cheap with too much eye makeup, something actresses did a lot in the 1960s and early '70s.. I did like her name Tiffany Case. There wasn't much else to like.

Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman choose to leave the serious Fleming-esquire film and take the Goldfinger approach of action humor and an outrageous plot. They even went as far to give Sean Connery to play 007. The film promised to be one of the best, with Connery saying that the script was the best one we've had, certainly construction wise. Unfortunately, the film isn't as good as Connery makes it to be.The problems with the film start right with the main character, 007. Sean Connery does very little in terms of acting in the film besides giving one liners that are mostly cringe worthy. The Bond we start off with in the teaser sequence of the film is apparently revenge minded and more like the Bond of Dr. No and From Russia With Love. But after Bond arrives in Las Vegas, Bond becomes a light hearted comedic character. Age is also an issue, as Connery changes hairstyle and color many times in the film and his scene with Plenty are unbelievable due to a very obvious large age difference.The main girl, Tiffany Case, is another character that starts off good and ends up comedic and useless. Her meeting Bond in Holland, her treatment of Bond and her getting the diamonds in the Circus, Circus casino shows her to be a tough character who puts Bond in his place more than once. But once the pursuit in the Moon Buggy is over and for the rest of the film, Tiffany becomes a complete bimbo and a Bond sufficient woman. This can't be blamed on Jill St. John who does the best that she can with this poorly written role.The role of Ernst Stavro Blofeld the role is both poorly written and terribly mis-casted. He is much more interesting as he hides behind the cover of Willard Whyte. It is only here that the character has any menace what so ever. Once it's revealed that Blofeld is only pretending to be Whyte, the character becomes rather tiresome. Also, Blofeld and Bond share no chemistry, such as in the previous film, between them, only adding a tired feel to the film. This is only hurt by one of the worst casting decisions in Bond history, and do I dare say all film history, Charles Gray. Gray, who is much better in his very short role in You Only Live Twice, is the worst of the trio of actors to portray Blofeld.The only bright spot cast wise is the supporting cast. Plenty O'Toole is the best of the supporting cast as she steals every scene she is in during her short appearance. Willard Whtye is a truly inspired character who is serious and only once used for a laugh (Whtye Burt Saxby? Bond Yes. Whyte Tell him he's fired!) and he actually makes a very good joke. The casting of Jimmy Dean in that role was also inspired and he is surprisingly very believable. The characters of Burt Saxby, Morton Slumber, Shady Tree are all very well cast and stand out enough to make this a memorable film in terms of supporting cast.With that said, it is worth noting that the supporting cast is not perfect. The roles of Felix Lieter and the henchmen Wint and Kidd are underwritten and in the case of Lieter is mis-cast. The characters of Wint and Kidd, like their boss Blofeld, lack menace and are used entirely for comical purposes, shooting bad quips at every given opportunity. Norman Burton is totally unbelievable in the role and the badly written part doesn't help at all.The action in the film reflects the approach of humor and outrageousness. The opening fight in the teaser sequence starts off good, though it is largely tame compared to the fight that started off the previous film. The fight in the elevator stands out as the best action sequence in the film and gives the film a much-needed dose of realism. But the moon buggy chase and car chase are useless as neither one pushes the plot on and are nothing more than attempts to showcase Bond's skills at causing the police and security guards to destroy their cars. The climactic battle on the oil rig is boring, hampered down by terrible effects of exploding helicopters and a pathetic end to the film. The fight that actually ends the film, with Wint and Kidd against Bond, is totally boring and only adds to the overall boredom that is apparent in the film.If there is a bright spot in this film its John Barry's score. The score is never played for laughs and perfectly suits the films Las Vegas location and helps to add some much needed tension to the film, particularly in the climb outside the Whtye House. The score does have its moments of lacking. The music for the Moon Buggy chase is not well suited to the chase and the over use of a action theme that starts in the teaser and goes right trough to the end of the film becomes tiresome. Also, some of the score takes a lot from earlier ones (the Moon Buggy chase sounding like the Gypsy girl fight in From Russia With Love and the music accompanying the various attacks by Blofeld's satellite sounds like the space march from You Only Live Twice). But overall it remains one of the overall best Bond scores with its use of both the James Bond Theme and the 007 theme. With lackluster performances by the major cast, a overall good supporting cast, ridiculous action sequences, and a score that is one of the best in the series, Diamonds Are Forever is a very mixed bag that proves to be better in parts rather than the whole.

Critics and audiences didn't know what to make of the new Bond and the more tragic story so producers Harry Saltsman and Albert Broccoli got Guy Hamilton back to direct so to replicate the tone and feel that made Goldfinger a success nearly a decade earlier and nearly got John Gavin to star as Bond to appeal to American audiences. But at the last minute Sean Connery came back to the role with the promise of ¬£1.25 million which was unheard of at the time. But I think that the final product was a mistake.(Don't get me wrong because I used to love this movie when I was younger but after exposing myself to more better Bonds, this one is Connery's weakest.)The plot and screenplay is a campy mess involving diamond smuggling and a laser satellite. Sean Connery is clearly bored as James Bond and is showing off no emotion to the fact that his wife was murdered in the previous film. Jill St. John is beautiful but is very weak and inconsistent with her character. Bond's wife is never mentioned or alluded as to why he is personally tracking down Blofeld only to confront him nonchalantly as he always has in the past and Charles Grey as Blofeld is a joke in this film. Don't get me started on Bruce Glover, Putter Smith and Jimmy Dean. The less said the better.Guy Hamilton clearly forgot everything when he was making Goldfinger as the movie is way to campy to take seriously after the tragic ending of On Her Majestys Secret Service. I also blame the screenwriters for the poorly written plot.I still like this movie as the entertainment value is there and its nice to see Sean Connery again but as a sequel to On Her Majestys Secret Service its very weak and disappointing.

The fact that the gap was filled by On Her Majesty's Secret Service only emphasizes even more how lacking Diamond's Are Forever actually is. OHMSS is unquestionably one of the best films in the series with an ending that is incredibly bleak. It's definitely the bravest entry in the franchise. From the word go, it's follow up Diamonds Are Forever is strictly back to business as usual. We begin in an underground hideout sequence with Bond fighting Blofeld. It's silly beyond words, and from here the film alternates between being ridiculous and borderline tedious. Why is this? Well, for one thing, Connery seems to clearly just be in it for the money now. He is playing a role you know he can't be bothered with anymore and turns in a performance that is strictly by the numbers. He's not even in very good shape which adds to the over all lacking quality in his screen presence. But the film as a whole is very underwhelming. The plot line seemed to me to be all over the place; we began with diamonds and somehow ended with deadly outer-space laser weapons. And I can't say I'm sure how we got from one plot point to the other. None of this would matter of course if the film was otherwise loaded with the usual thrills and glamour. But in all honesty there are only small moments here that are memorable &#x96; the lift fight and the Vegas car-chase for example. At other times the overall whole is undermined by a definite smirking to camera approach where it's almost played as a comedy &#x96; this would go on to be a feature of the rest of the 70's films with Roger Moore in the main role. Although Moore is far better suited to comedy, so it works a bit better in his movies on the whole. While the film does have interesting characters in the gay hit men, it also has an nonthreatening Blofeld, a lightweight Bond girl and the faintly ridiculous &#x96; if admittedly memorable Bambi and Thumper.Ultimately, Diamonds Are Forever gets too much wrong, and is only a very average film. It may have been set in Vegas but it's roll of the dice hasn't produced a winner.

It felt like an old retreaded tire that for all the resources and talent dumped into it should have shined. But instead it failed.So, what happened? Bond, and specifically Connery's Bond, is a serious officer of Britain's military intelligence, division six. But now he's just an actor going through the motions of showing his face for a camp extravaganza. And one wonders what all the humor was for anyway. I mean, why was it put in there to begin with?Did some young producer with money say We're taking Bond in a new direction...? I mean, for all of some of the bad lines or borderline camp moments in the previous films, they did come across as high moments of drama and peril. The fun was in the notion that Bond's character knew all too well that his outcome was favored, and savored the victory with various emotional tones (situation depending).Somehow this seemed to be lost on the production team for Diamonds. How and why they missed this one can only speculate. But, for whatever reason, the formula that made the previous Bond films successful was completely abandoned. As if the new threat was nothing to be taken seriously, because the previous films were silly (or so the production team and director probably thought). As a result we get this foolish and very weak installment of the world's most famous secret agent, who is reduced to a middle aged smile.Where's the Bond with a purpose from the previous films? Why on Earth even make this film? Answer; to salvage a franchise until such time as another replacement Bond can be discovered.It's one of the great cinematic screw ups in history. It ranks up there with the Salkinds' trashing of the Superman property or their creative financing with the musketeer films. Diamonds is just series of half heartedly acted scenes strewn together to tell a threadbare story with threadbare acting.I'm just truly at a loss of how to explain this film. I mean, Dr. No had its moments of silliness, but you could suspend your disbelief and note the silliness for being serious moments of espionage drama. Ditto with You only Live Twice, Thunderball, From Russia... and Goldfinger. Sure, Bond had some extreme moments, but Connery's acting ability and the supporting cast helped pull it off. The cast truly brought those films to life.And the icing on the cake were the two villains; the two misters who seemed about as animated as third string understudys at some hick community theatre. And there was supposed to be some kind of undercurrent between the two? Huh?Well, Bond had come to America before, but never with a worse cause. And all the money thrown at Connery seemed to be money ill spent, and this comes from a man who is a big Connery fan, and specifically because of the Bond films.Look, I could go on, but will refrain. I mean, it is supposed to be a James Bond film, and so I'll let that little factoid help bolster the rest of its frayed reputation. Things that could've improved this film; a tighter scripts, better direction aimed at Connery; something like Sean, dammit, remember your past roles? That's the Bond we need here! Stop sleep walking with a smirk!, a better plot, better action sequences, and a sense of import to the film at large.Otherwise the score is fine, the opening song is good, the lensing is so-so. Just overall the film is uninspired. But, as I say, it is a James Bond film, so the astute Bond fan will of course add the film to his collection.Take it for what it's worth. If you want classic Connery Bond, then see one of the earlier films.

It is nonetheless disappointing that Diamonds Are Forever turned out as it did. Returning Sean Connery to the role of 007 warmed the hearts of many, but the resulting film hurt the series' reputation.The film's faults lay in several areas.  First there is consistent miscasting.  Charles Gray takes over the role of Bond archenemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld and fails to convey any real menace - at times he comes off more as a mild Burgess Meredith imitation than as a serious criminal mastermind. Gray shone as Henderson from You Only Live Twice but is miscast here, especially in his awful drag disguise.Then there is the inept Jill St. John as Tiffany Case, diamond smuggler recruited by SPECTRE who helps James defeat them.  St. John isn't as attractive as other Bond girls and is too gee-whiz wide-eyed to be taken seriously here.Then there are the film's offbeat henchmen, homo assassins Messrs Wint and Kidd.  They enjoy their work together a little too much throughout the film and are so annoying as to ruin any tension their presence conveys.  Their demise is unsatisfying as well - Wint's arms are set ablaze and he just stands there and lets the fire envelop him (haven't these bad guys heard of stop, drop, and roll?), while Kidd winds up running with his tail (or more accurately another appendage) between his legs.With all this miscasting comes the film's next signature failing, its campiness.  Cheesy one-liners pervade the dialogue (especially with Messrs Wint and Kidd) and the film's mood is totally wrong - there simply is no tension created at any time.  Sean Connery's performance is his weakest ever - he basically phones in his performance in near-complete camp style and his one-liners lack any bite.The campiness extends to the scene that cheats the audience worst of all - the sex scene that never was between Bond and Plenty O'Toole, seen from the back before bein grabbed and uncermoniously tossed into a pool by Mob henchman (veteran TV heavy Sid Haig is one of the mobsters) working for Tiffany Case.Then there is the setting.  Part of the strength of the Bond films is their setting in varied locales about which most in the audience lack any real knowledge - the West Indies settings of Dr. No and Thunderball, the Turkish-Balkan settings of From Russia With Love, Japan in You Only Live Twice, and the Swiss Alps in On Her Majesty's Secret Service add enormously to the atmosphere of the films.  In Diamonds the Las Vegas setting totally fails; there is nothing in Vegas to convey any kind of dramatic atmosphere. The film is obviously trying to recapture the magic of Goldfinger, with its setting in the US, but the complete camp and cheese atmosphere and the complete familiarity of Vegas robs any tension from the setting.The central SFX sequence and climatic air-cavalry assault on Blofeld's HQ also fail; inspired by both the space setting of You Only Live Twice and the helicopter assault at the end of Her Majesty's Secret Service, this time there is no surprise element, no real suspense, and the effects work on the film's laser cannon looks cheap and sloppy - one can live with the comparative cheapness of the rocket launches in You Only Live Twice, but the explosion effects here simply do not work.It is all of such low quality that even the film's strengths are overlooked - the surprisingly effective performance of Jimmy Dean, the swimming lesson between James and athletic guardians Bambi and Thumper, the competent performance of Normann Burton as Felix Leiter (though once again miscasting is the case), the uncredited Shane Rimmer, and the always engaging Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell, and Desmond Llewelyn.It would take a few years before the Bond series truly returned to its entertaining plateau of the 1960s, and Diamonds has aged reasonably well, but it nonetheless is the nadir of the Bond series.

Easily and clumsily, as usual, but still he did in 5 minutes what he couldn't for a few movies before this. Naturally, he's getting revenge as the previous chapter ended on a sad note with Blofeld killing Bond's one and only wife.Also as usual Bond's out for revenge &#x96; no convincing me otherwise, and of course, Sean Conner's smirking demeanor never changes. He's neither satisfied, nor happy, nor angry, nor ecstatic. He's just smirking away, like he's done floating through now six of the seven Bond franchises. In fact, the only thing that has changed is that Connery looks like he's aged a bunch since two movies back You Only Live Twice and that was only four years prior.I digress. This movie started off promising with action, the best desert chase scene since Eegah, a decent idea and song, a rare secret identity for Bond and hell, it was even long before it's time by including an obviously gay duo, albeit evil and bumbling, but still. And the cherry on top we got a somewhat decent Las Vegas of the early 1970s chase scene, including driving up and down the currently closed Fremont Street. (I use somewhat decent chase scene because it's few and far between that Bond movies really imagine or show an inventive chase sequence.)And then&#x85;.the movie literally went to sh|t. No joke.

That's here nor there, because they end up on an oil station on the ocean and Godzilla-type special effects are the main focus and whoa&#x85;they were bad.Thankfully, that was the finale, so it really couldn't get much worse. But, from starting off good, and continuing to some interesting scenes &#x96; such as a fairly good high up, outdoor elevator scene, it really went to hell in the second half and if you feel like finishing this, you'll have a cartoonishly bad time.Oh, when will this series get cool? Become fun and adventurous? Will it, relatively soon? Yeah, I'm a modern Bond fan &#x96; the first third or so films were before I was even conceived, but come on. On the flip side, I do believe what ain't broke, don't fix&#x85;and that makes me feel pity on the lowest of expectations of audiences back in the 1960s-1970s.Hopefully, the next film will let the good live and let the cheese die.

George Lazenby certainly thought so, and after one film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, he bailed the franchise on the advice of his agent. The public, apparently, also agreed with Lazenby, because while OHMSS was definitely successful (every Bond film has been), it didn't do as well as Sean Connery's previous outings. This probably had to do with Connery himself not being involved with the film, so with this in his mind, producer Cubby Broccoli sought to it that his star come back.Long story short, Connery eventually agreed to star in Diamonds Are Forever. The film itself, to be blunt, is terrible, and the first real indication that Eon was getting sloppy with their execution. I won't go much into the plot because, well, there really isn't one. The film loosely follows the superior and much too maligned novel of the same name, except it adds doubles for Blofeld (played far too passively by Charles Gray, who at one point lets Bond go so he can put him in another pointless death trap when he can just shoot him right then and there!), misplaced satellites in space, diamond double-crosses that serve no purpose beyond leading Bond to Vegas, stupid characters, etc. And when we do (kind of) figure out the plan, it comes as a huge disappointment.Done right, all of this might have made for some kind of entertainment, but it all piles on until the end, when the audience it left scratching their heads and trying to make some kind of sense of the whole affair, which is of course pointless because even the filmmakers don't seem to have an idea of what's going on. So if the story is a let-down, the action must make up for it, right? Unfortunately, all the action scenes in DAF are all similar and dull. They're played mostly for laughs, too, which kills any tension that was possible. This is most obvious in the Las Vegas car chase. Of all the films, Diamonds Are Forever is surely one of the most boring and cheap-looking, with even the Ken Adam sets not matching those of the past or the future. I blame it on director Guy Hamilton, whose chases and general style didn't even come close to most other directors in the Bond canon.What's left, then? The special effects are humiliating and way too distracting. Are you telling me every explosion creates a puff of dust and then quickly disappears like an over-heated oven? Even with Connery's large pay-check taking away a large sum of the budget, these effects are embarrassing. The locations are pretty lifeless, especially the main one of Las Vegas. As I mentioned, the characters are not only boring and artificial, but the actors themselves don't bring their all, even the all-mighty Connery, who looks much, MUCH older than in You Only Live Twice and is suitably bored with the proceedings,only rarely showing the flair that he did in the previous entries.Take the ending, for example, where he strolls onto the oil rig looking like he can stop Blofeld's evil plot in no time (not that Bond even understands what's going on anyway.) Continuing with characters, two deserve singling out. Jimmy Dean as Willard Whyte, while having a blast, is completely out of place while Tiffany Case starts out as intelligent, but turns into a bumbling fool by the end who is unbelievable as an expert diamond smuggler. Probably the only characters in the film that are remotely interesting are Mister Wint and Mister Kidd, played by Bruce Glover and Putter Smith. The two make a great killer duo, and play off of each other well. Not to mention they look like they're having the time of their lives and give a believable performance at the same time. The movie has very little going for it except a haunting and memorable score from John Barry, some of the best lines in the series, and a unique fight in an elevator that seems to be one of the only things that Connery really gets into!

They are a great screen couple and even the fact that Putter Smith can't act doesn't ruin that.Funny thing about Diamonds Are Forever is that it's a typical Roger Moore Bond even though Sean Connery plays Bond in this one. The humor is very similar to the later Roger Moore Bonds and Sean Connery certainly portrays the most fun Bond out of his career.Then the most important thing The Bond girl. Finally a good Bond girl again, Jill St. John plays one of the best Bond girls out of the long series of Bond movies. But even better is Lana Wood as Plenty O'Toole that unfortunately only has a very limited role.Watching Diamonds Are Forever is 2 hours of pure entertainment. Far from the best Bond but it serves it's purpose.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"The worst of all the Bond films","Date":"26 April 1999","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  While Moonraker and License to Kill are the best Bond films, Diamonds Are Forever is the worst Bond film of them all.

Nevertheless, it's one of the most enjoyable.Sean Connery (after a sabbatical) returns as 007 to investigate what appears to be a diamond smuggling operation only to end up in Las Vegas battling Blofeld (a very good Charles Gray). Also along for the ride is foxy Jill St. John, a Howard Hughes-like billionaire played by country singer-cum-sausage king Jimmy Dean, as well as Natalie Wood's sister, Lana (playing the fittingly named Plenty O'Toole). It's action packed and features what has to be one of the most remarkable car chases on film and is helmed by classy director Guy Hamilton. Connery and St. John have real chemistry and the villains are dynamite, including a kinky duo named Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. Both St. John and Grey have many tart tongued lines of dialog. The great Marc Lawrence pops up in a cameo as do Sammy Davis Jr., Nicky Blair and BLOOD FEAST starlet Connie Mason.

Nearly every aspect of the film is uniformly bad.  Coming off the superb On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which is in my mind the best Bond film yet, Diamonds Are Forever is an immense disapointment.Story-wise the film is perhaps the worst part.  After Bond's wife Tracy died in the previous movie, we should've had a revenge-minded Bond going after Blofeld in a tense, realistic espionage story.  Instead we get a light-hearted, humor-filled a story in which Tracy is not mentioned once. While there is some trace of revenge in the pre-credit sequence with Bond going after Blofeld, it appears to me he is merely going after Blofed because it is his job not because of his memory for Tracy.  Instead of realism, we get a campy film with absolutely no trace of tension or adventure.  Nearly every part of the film is unbelieveable, and the charcters are 1-dimenionsal at best.  The ending is completely uninvolving and the usual huge set is cheap looking.  The worst travesty of the ending though, is the fact that Bond doesn't even take revenge on Blofeld!While many people said bringing Sean Connery back is an automatic plus, I strongly dissagree.  Now don't get me wrong I am a big Connery fan and in the early Bond films he was really quite good, but his performance in the film is a complete bore. Obviously he was unexcited about doing another Bond film and was doing it only for the huge amounts of money the producers paid him. After seeing this perfomance I was even missing George Lazenby, even though he isnh't as good an actor as Connery at least he was energetic in his portrayal as Bond.Other actors in the film are poor to say the best.  Jill St. John as the companion is satisfactory at the beginning of the film as the strength and resolve of her charcter are definate strong points.  However, by the end of the film she turns into a complete idiot whom Bond constantly puts down. Charles Gray as Blofeld is perhaps the worst Bond villian yet. Non-threating to Bond, he is simply there to make suposedly funny comments. Even the MI6 regulars, usually unflapple in their diginity, manage to embarass themselves in this mess.Most Bond fans say that The Man With the Golden Gun or A View To a Kill are the worst Bond films, but at least those films are enjoyable.  Diamonds Are Forever is a complete mess and if you want to see a good Bond Film rent For Your Eyes Only or On Her Majesty's Secret Service Avoid this piece of junk at all costs!

The answer was simple to make another movie just like Goldfinger!Guy Hamilton, the director of Goldfinger, were brought back to direct Diamonds Are Forever the eighth Bond movie overall, and the seventh EON Bond film to be made. The movie was based on Ian Fleming's fourth James Bond novel of the same name. After Lazenby had bowed out of the series, the producers went to Sean Connery waving with a huge paycheck, and Connery eventually agreed to return as James Bond! So we had Guy Hamilton and Sean Connery back in action! What could possibly go wrong? The movie itself is the answer to that question...The movie starts out with Bond hot on the trail of Blofeld... like in the previous movie. Bond is eager to get revenge on Blofeld, in return for Bond's dead wife. We are just thrown into the plot with no explanation. The pre-credit sequence isn't exiting at all... it's just a rushed little revenge story, that doesn't really work very well. The rest of the movie centers around an international diamond smuggling ring, that Bond is meant to infiltrate and in the end... follow the trail of the diamonds. It's not a bad plot. But the movie quickly pulls you away from all of that and begins to concentrate about random stuff like James Bond in a circus and Blofeld dressing in drag. It's just so dumb and lame that I don't even want to comment more on that. In the end the plot is decent, but the execution is lame and dumb.Sean Connery returns for his sixth and last appearance as James Bond, and even he is lacking! He just seems bored like never before, and he was really to old to play the part at that age! But I don't blame him. Connery had clearly moved on from the role of James Bond, and while it was a shame, it's also fair. Connery had already given us 5 remarkable and fantastic performances as James Bond, and he created probably the most beloved character in cinema history! It's a shame that he finished his Bond era with this piece of crap! But Sean Connery is Sean Connery, and the stars I have given this movie is most to his glory! Jill St. John plays Tiffany Case and she has got to be one of the worst Bond girls ever. She can't act, and her chemistry with Connery just seems awkwardly out of place. At least she is very beautiful! Charles Gray (who also played Dikko Henderson in You Only Live Twice) is our main villain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. And he sucks! Don't get me wrong, Gray is a good actor but he should have been remembered for his supporting role in You Only Live Twice, and not for this! This movie is the absolute low point for the character of Blofeld. Gray's Blofeld is just some jerk, with a big and cheesy cowboy smile on his face, who clones himself. Hell, he even wears drag in this movie! This is not the epic Blofeld we were introduced to in the previous James Bond- outings! Lana Wood plays Plenty O'Toole, and boy is she sexy and also weak. Her acting is non-existent and so is her chemistry with Connery! Bruce Glover and Putter Smith is the homosexual henchmen of the film. Their portrayals are a bit homophobic, but as villains they're creepy enough, I suppose. They're OK. Norman Burton is fourth and the worst Felix Leiter ever to have been portrayed. Burton basically created a comedic character that wasn't funny. We do have the awesome trio Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell returning, respectively.Diamonds Are Forever is one of those movies, that I don't have anything particular nice to say about. It's just so dumb. And while some movies are dumb but kind of entertaining (Moonraker and Die Another Day) this one isn't even the slightest entertaining. So it's both dumb, bland and boring. There isn't even a single character in the movie that I like, except for James Bond and all of the other recurring characters! Guy Hamilton seems to have completely forgotten how to make a good Bond movie! Goldfinger is probably my favorite Bond movie, while this is definitely my least favorite! There's a big difference considering they both come from the same director! How this movie has a higher rating on IMDb than License To Kill is beyond my imagination! But it is a Bond movie, and I have a very strong bond to the movies, so I always kind of enjoy watching it even though I still hate it. The movie has aged well, you could say. I just love the Bond universe that much. So if you're a hardcore fan then check it out (some actually do love it), but if you're a casual viewer, then you should by all means skip it!4/10 "}{"Title":"A stupid action comedy","Date":"19 November 2011","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" After the last 5 bond films doing so well, we get this train wreck.Calling Connery back was a BIG mistake, because he didn't want to come back at all,he was only doing it for the money and when actors are only making a film for the money,they don't enjoy it and when you watch a film like that then you don't enjoy it either. Connery looked like he just wanted to get off the set as quick as he could and go home and he looked like he wasn't enjoying the film at all.There's a lot of stupid excuses for comedy, blofields doubles are just silly and he's hardly in the movie at all, and the whole billionaire incarcirated in his own home is really stupid and the diamond satellite thing has nothing to do with these two things whatsoever. The choice of actors is really bad, most of the actors make the film look like a comedy and the producers might as well have hired a bunch of stand up comedians to do the actors jobs. The moonbugy chase is a stupid excuse for an action scene and all bond does is hang around Las Vegas partying with women and visiting casinos.The part At the end of the movie where bond menaces Blofeild with a crane is very badly done and i would have had bond and blofield fighting each other physically, we don't even see what happens to blofield at the end of the movie, did he live, did he die, remains a mystery...Ranting aside, there are a few good scenes including a punch up in an elevator which is very well done, a car chase, a small shootout, loud explosions and a battle scene at the end of the film,the storyline is terrible but it's a little intriguing. This movie is alright, but it could have been much better, if you want a silly comedy, this is the film for you, but i would recommend this one for bond fans only.

This movie starts out one of Blofeld's lairs, where they are doing plastic surgery to make doubles of Blofeld. Bond tries to get in, but gets caught. In an almost cartoonish moment, the world's stupidest guard gets his hand caught in a booby-trap in Bond's jacket. For some reason, all the guards in this scene have little lightning-bolts on their helmets. Bond manages to knock out Blofeld and push him in a pool of lava. (Why is there a big pool of lava in a plastic surgeons school? Completely nonsensical.) Roll the opening credits.The rest of the movie is how Bond must track down some smuggled diamonds, that everyone who comes into contact with gets killed by the two henchmen, Wint and Kidd, who are homosexuals.Highlights of this movie include Blofeld in drag, Bond revealing his Playboy Club Card, a giant space laser which destroys missiles in a very fake manner, a gay man getting a wedgie with his own neck tie (much to his enjoyment), an elephant playing slot machines, a car that can miraculously go from being on it's two left wheels to being on it's two right wheels, and some great shots of Jill St. John's buttocks.This movie is hilariously stupid and should only be watched for it's camp value.

The flaws here are too numerous to list incoherent, illogical script (you can watch this film 100 times and still not be able to follow the story), unexciting car chases, total lack of tension and urgency, Connery in his most bored and by-the-numbers performance as 007, one of the dumbest Bond Girls ever (though she begins as smart), and so on. The redeeming virtues are few the brutal and realistic fistfight in the elevator, the memorable (and sexy) encounter with Bambi and Thumper, the sometimes-funny quips of the Mr. Wint-Mr. Kidd team, Charles Gray's amusing (if not imposing) performance as Blofeld. Overall though, it's a shame Connery had to end his early Bond legacy (12 years before his not-much-better comeback in Never Say Never Again) with this turkey.

In fact, this is not only Sean Connery's weakest film as Bond, but it is also one of the weaker Bond films. It does have its saving graces, but it is very disappointing.It has its saving graces I admit- The Las Vegas sequences were very nicely done, and Bruce Glover and Putter Smith make an interesting double act as the gay hit men. And the scenery and photography is striking, plus the main theme song sung by Shirley Bassey is wonderful.However, the plot is a bit of a mess. It seems simple certainly, but it is badly underdeveloped. I think they should have reinforced the idea of using Gert Frobe as Goldfinger's twin brother, I think that would have elevated the film if included. Then we have a tacky script that relies too much on slapstick and unfocused direction. And the acting is not great, Sean Connery is my favourite Bond mainly due to his suavity and charisma but he seems bored and uninterested here and gives an unusually flat performance in the role, while Charles Gray did nothing for me as Blofeld and Jill St John makes for an unmemorable Bond girl.Overall, rather weak but has its moments. 4/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Diamonds Are Forever","Date":"13 July 2005","Score":"2 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" The original star of the series only returned, following the one and only film from George Lazenby, when producers paid him over $1,000,000, which he donated to the Scottish International Education Trust, but it is one the less successful entries, based on the book by Ian Fleming, directed by Guy Hamilton (The Colditz Story, Goldfinger, Battle of Britain, Live and Let Die). Basically James Bond 007 (Sir Sean Connery) pursues formerly head of SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter- intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray, presumably (although never mentioned) to avenge the death of his wife, Bond finds him in a facility creating Blofeld lookalikes, he drowns the real Blofeld in a pool of superheated mud. Bond is told there is a worldwide plot where South African diamonds have been stolen from mines, several of those smuggling them are being killed one-by-one by homosexual assassins Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith). Bond travels to Amsterdam, Holland, posing as diamond smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, to meet his contact, Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), the real Peter Franks (Joe Robinson) shows up, but Bond intercepts and kills him, and switches his ID making it seem that Franks is in fact Bond. The diamonds are smuggled into Los Angeles in Franks' corpse, Bond is met by CIA agent Felix Leiter (Norman Burton) before travelling to Los Angeles, where the diamonds are passed on to Shady Tree (Leonard Barr). Bond escapes an assassination by Wint and Kidd, placing him in a coffin for cremation, Tree stops the process are finding the diamonds were fake, planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond finds that Tree is a stand-up comedian working at hotel-casino The Whyte House, owned by reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), Tree is murdered by Wint and Kidd, they did not realise the diamonds were fake, Bond meanwhile is there and meets opportunistic Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) while gambling. Gang members get rid of Plenty and leave the room, where Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany, he instructs her to retrieve the real diamonds at Circus Circus casino, but she goes back on this arrangement and flees. Tiffany finds Plenty O'Toole is dead in her swimming pool, the assassins mistook her for Tiffany, the real diamonds are passed on to Albert R. 'Bert' Saxby (Bruce Cabot), Bond follows him to a facility, where he finds a laser satellite being built by laser refraction specialist Professor Doctor Metz (Joseph F√ºrst), Bond escapes when his cover is blown in a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. After evading arrest from the police, Bond leaves Tiffany to scale The Whyte House to confront Willard Whyte, he instead greeted by two identical Blofelds, they are using an electronic device to sound like Whyte, Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but finds it is his lookalike, he is then knocked out and left for dead by Wint and Kidd in a pipeline. Bond escapes and calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device to sound like Saxby, to find out where the real Whyte is being held, Bond and the CIA infiltrate the location, find and rescue him, the real Saxby attempting an assassination is killed in the process. Bond and Whyte work out that a laser satellite has been built, the diamonds are being used to retract light and create a powerful blast, it is already in orbit, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, an international auction for global nuclear supremacy is proposed by Blofeld. Whyte identifies an oil platform off the coast of Baja California, not being part of his empire, as being Blofeld's base of operations, Bond fails in an attempt to change the cassette tape needed to control the satellite, with a mistake by Toiffany, but he does signal Leiter and the CIA to attack the rig. Blofeld attempts to escape in a midget submarine, but Bond uses it launch crane to crash it into the control room and destroy it, the end sees Bond and Tiffany on a cruise ship heading to Britain, Wint and Kidd pose as room service to attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb, but Bond kills them instead. Also starring Bernard Lee as M, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny, Margaret Lacey as Mrs. Whistler, Lola Larson as Bambi, Trina Parks as Thumper, Laurence Naismith as Sir Donald Munger, David Bauer as Mr. Slumber, Ed Bishop as Klaus Hergersheimer, Shane Rimmer as Tom and Captain Scarlet's David Healy as Vandenburg Launch Director. Connery does alright but is not highly convincing as he was before being the suave and cool super spy, Gray as the only Blofeld with hair is good, and the gay hit men couple get their witty moments, this film is let down by a dull script, there are some good chase sequences and fight scenes, but accompanied by pathetic special effects it has many weak points, overall it is a naff but reasonably watchable spy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Sir Sean Connery was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 2 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for the title song by Dame Shirley Bassey.

Sean Connery had really aged by 1971 when this film came out. Lois Maxwell, as Moneypenny, looked like she was ready to collect social security benefits and Bernard Lee,(M) looked as though he were in very poor health.The plot was confusing. There was diamond smuggling going on from the Union of South Africa to Holland. Along the way, a dentist, and a spinster teacher are bludgeoned to death. They belonged to the gang. The murder and mayhem is being done by 2 homosexuals who are openly gay. I didn't know that author Ian Fleming attended Brokeback Mountain way back.Jill St. John portrays a stupid redhead who is in with the smugglers but changes sides when she meets and falls for the dashing Bond. Of course, there are the usual car chases, explosions and a memorable fight scene in an elevator along the way.The ending might very well rile Conservatives. One of the homosexuals literally gets done in at his rear end and seems to enjoy it before the bomb goes off.Speaking of bombs, this is exactly what this film is.The main villain, Blofeld, comes in 3-there are 2 clones of him. 1 would have been more than sufficient in this failure of a picture.
