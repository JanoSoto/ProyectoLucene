SEE THIS MOVIE!!","Date":"18 April 2001","Score":"67 out of 70 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  When Parenthood first came out, I did my level best to avoid it, certain that it seeing it would be roughly akin to being embalmed with maple syrup.  Then came that dreadfully slow night at home a couple of years later, faced with a choice on the ol' tube between endless reruns of Three's Company and HBO showing -- oh, no! -- Parenthood.  So I clicked on HBO, gritted my teeth, prepared for the worst . . .And was wrong.Ron Howard is one savvy filmmaker.  Maybe one of the savviest, I'm not sure.  But I do know that, to make Parenthood, he combined his savvy with all the heart he could muster (which was plenty, apparently) and that the result is a masterpiece.Virtually every aspect of parenting is examined; moreover, it is done in a way that -- miracle of miracles! -- causes you to think, and to feel, every bit as much as it makes you laugh.  Throat lumping up?  Not to worry, here comes another belly-laugh to smooth it out.The key to the film's message may lie with Jason Robards' speech --There's no goal line in parenting, no end zone where you spike the ball and that's it . . . -- or it may lie with Keanu Reeves -- You know, Mrs. Buckman, you need a license to drive a car or buy a dog . . . -- or it may simply be Gil Buckman's (Steve Martin) heroism in salvaging his emotionally disturbed son's birthday party; then again, it might be embodied in the frantic, stressed out stoicism of Dianne Wiest's single mom character as she comes to grips with her teenage daughter's choices and impending motherhood.  But wherever you find it herein, the message is simple and profound Parenthood is nothing less than heroism on a daily basis.  Quiet, unheralded, underappreciated heroism.One of the finest things about this movie is that nobody steps out of character.  There are no miraculous revelations, no nick-of-time cavalry charges or character transformations.  Characters here solve their individual dilemmas by growing WITHIN their characters.  And realistically, at that.It's been said that a really good story leaves its author crying as he/she writes the final pages.  Sometimes -- not often enough -- a really good movie can leave a reviewer the same way as he finishes his commentary, crying and laughing simultaneously.Well, don't just stand there!  Someone get me a Kleenex!!

I already loved Parenthood when I was a kid and I perhaps love it even more now as a grownup, when I recently watched it again.Perhaps the greatest strength of this movie is in its realism. Sure every character and event in the movie are somewhat silly and over-the-top but yet they also feel like very real problems and persons at the same time. This due to the great portrayal of the drama elements in the movie. These are real, recognizable or not, family-issues portrayed in this movie. It handles some delicate subjects but never without a smile as well. It makes this movie both touching and warm to watch, as well as fun and amusing.Reason why both the dramatic and comical elements all work so well is also thanks to the cast. The movie has many well known actors in it. Tom Hulce especially impressed me and also Steve Martin was a great leading man, from the period when he was still funny in movies. Solid as always were Mary Steenburgen and Dianne Wiest. Rick Moranis surprisingly doesn't play a loser this time but he still is a nutty character in the movie. He shows in this movie that he also has some real acting skills. Keanu Reeves is also good in his role, from the period when he appeared mostly in just comedies. The still very young Joaquin Phoenix also plays a great and quite big role in the movie.It has some totally unforgettable moments in it, both comedy-wise as in its drama. It all makes this movie one of the most warm and subtle movies ever made. It doesn't try to be funny, it doesn't try to be melodramatic. The end result of it all is an extremely well balanced and crafted mix of drama and comedy that works on both levels. You can watch this movie as a drama or as a comedy, so fans of both the genre will be pleased with this movie that surely does not disappoint in any way.An early subtle Ron Howard masterpiece, that is criminally underrated here on IMDb.9/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"parenting 101 (and a graduate course)","Date":"2 July 2004","Score":"29 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  there are movies that entertain... enlighten... challenge... confuse.parenthood is a movie that will be more and more a classic as YOU move through life. it's a look at family-life and how we do the right things and the wrong things as we move from the parentED to the parentERS. as lead-pastor of a church that is dedicated to serving 19 to 29 year olds, this is one movie that is as much a teaching lesson as it is entertainment. when one looks to learn, there are many notes to be taken here. equally entertaining, the whole ensemble is stellar as it portrays the inner workings of the buckman family tree. the 4 children of the patriarch and matriarch have grown and are now dealing with the parenting world first hand. they deal with the issues we all do workaholism, divorce, superparenting, self-promotion, etc. as their circles of life intersect (and they always do...), all the family members come to some conclusions... between over-parenting and under-parenting, there's a place where love resides in all of its splendor and strain. love HAS to win the day... even when those we love do and act they way that troubles us. life is an eXpedition... where we can struggle through it alone, or in with the support of others... but we're definitely going to have to be moving forward. parenthood reminds us all of the journey we're on. as parents we really cannot live FOR our children... for really, we ALL are children... still learning and making mistakes along the way. we recognize that what we really need in our lives are people who will love us all along the way. we then realize this is what our children need as well. the movie has so many deeply poignant, yet roll-on-the-floor funny moments. two of many favorites when the patriarch (jason robards)talking to (steve martin) realizes that his job as father never ends... there is no end, you never cross the goal line, spike the ball and do your touchdown dance, never... i'm 64 and larry is 27... and he's still my son, like kevin is your son... you think i want him to get hurt?... he's my son. also when grandma explains life to her joy of a roller-coaster over a merry-go-round... that a ride could make me so frightened, so scared, so sick, so excited and so thrilled all together... some didn't like it... they went on the merry-go-round... that just goes around... nothing... i like the roller-coaster... you get more out of it. life is seen as it's best understood... an amusement park that we all are going through. our perspective and our faith are the important factors.to me, this movie is way more then entertainment... it's a blessing. it will teach... if we are willing to learn.enjoy... and take good notes, ron  "},{"Title":"Good performances from a lot of good actors","Date":"7 February 2005","Score":"27 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" This is a classic ensemble film.

It shows, with equal measure, the joys and pain of parenting.  We see great examples of dysfunction and love.  It is sentimental, but not to the point of being unreal.Steve Martin gives a tremendous performance as a father, who wants to be everything that he feels his father wasn't loving, caring, and involved in his children's lives in a positive manner.  He is torn between his duties as a provider and the need to be there for his children.  Mary Steenburgen is wonderful, as always, as a devoted wife and mother.  She tries to keep her family on an even keel and to soothe their anxieties, her husband included. She conveys so much with just body language and has a smile that seems to come from her soul.  Jason Robards is his usual powerful self, as the patriarch who made himself a success, but at the expense of his family.  He recognizes his mistakes and finds a chance to make some amends in his twilight years.Diana Weist is the single mother, trying to provide for her troubled children, and find some life for herself.  She wants to give her kids what they want, but is torn between giving to them and watching them make mistakes.  Rick Moranis is the parent who wants their child to succeed, to the point of smothering their childhood.  He wants the best for his child, but fails to see that childhood should be as much about play and new experiences, as it is about education.  His wife wants the same, but wants their daughter to be a little girl, too.  She also wants another child, but feels that she is alone in this area and is losing her husband.  Tom Hulce is the irresponsible, youngest sibling, who has run off whenever things have become too tough.  Things get tough when you are a parent, and he stays true to form.The young actors are all tremendously talented and the little ones are quite cute.  It is no surprise that these performances are so good, given that the director was a child actor himself.  Ron Howard really knows how to bring the best out of young actors, as well as their adult counterparts.There is so much to savor in this film.  There are great laughs and touching moments.  There is drama and satire.  There is the joy of watching great character actors display their craft.  There are the clearly defied roles, with great complexity, that are easy to identify with.This is a film that all parents should see. Kids should see this, when they are old enough to understand the sacrifices that their parents make for them and why they make the decisions that they do.  Parenting  it's the toughest job you'll ever love!

Everyone has a colorful family to some extent; most (I hope) are full of good natured people but there are always rotten apples floating around.Director Ron Howard puts many lives on display and different challenges each one faces and every one of these inspections have something to offer. Steve Martin's reactions to his older son's adjustment problems are very well realized, with many humorous moments, to be sure, but at the core is a maturely handled and moving segment, and Martin has rarely been better.Diane Wiest's family drama consists of her inability to communicate properly to her two teenage children; the daughter a temperamental rebel with a loser boyfriend, the son a nearly recluse loner with raging hormones who thinks something is wrong with him (what guy hasn't been there at least once?). Superb performances form Wiest and (yes, surprisingly) Keanu Reeves really fuel this story which never loses itself despite seeing many humorous aspects in a rather depressing household.Jason Robards plays the family father who hasn't been all that good to his children since...well ever, and he faces a tough assignment when he has to admit to himself that one of his children, who has learned the most from him, is heading into disaster fast. The scene where he asks Steve Martin for advice is a moving scene in so many ways; it's never too late for an old dog to learn new tricks.Rick Moranis's tale of his insanely intellectual daughter is my least favorite but it does have a very charming conclusion. And that granny is priceless.Parenthood may be even better for those who have children and can identify with some situations depicted here but as for me, I think I can learn a thing or two for years to come.

But the main thing that appeals to me about Parenthood is the warm heart that is at the center of it all. These characters have nuanced, complicated, and not overly dramatic problems. Just like REAL PEOPLE, and unlike many of the one-faceted characters seen in movies today.And what better actor to play Gil than Steve Martin? A comedic genius, Martin is capable of playing anything from slimy to sincere, conforming perfectly to his role, and it helps that he's not a cynic. Also watch for great appearances by Tom Hulce, perhaps best known as Amadeus (poor guy, where'd his career go?) and a very young Joaquin Phoenix as Gary.All in all, a very funny and very sweet comedy that I will give a 9/10!!

I think we all forget that our parents are people too every once in a while and I ask my mom and dad how they did it, but they always tell me there is no book to raising a child, you just have to do the best you can and Parenthood is a comedic and sometimes serious interpretation of what all parents go through in the greatest and scariest times of their kid's lives.We go through four siblings Gil, played by Steve, who is trying so hard to be the perfect dad to his four children, but finds it to be too much than he expected. Larry, played by Tom, who can't seem to grow up and accept his responsibility to be a dad. Helen, played by Dianne, who has rebellious kids and she's a single mom learning how to handle her high school married daughter. And Julie, played by Martha, who's husband, played by Rick, won't stop taking over their daughter's possible fun childhood by stuffing her head with information she won't need until Harvard Law School.Parenthood is a terrific movie that really shows how hard it is to be a parent, but the terrific rewards that come with it.

I remember we liked it but we left the theater with a very depressed feeling in general about families.I just saw this again last night on DVD, renting it mostly to see how different Joaquin/Leaf Phoenix looked then compared to now, and this time, as I approach the age of Steve Martin's character (actually, I'm much closer in age and success to Larry played by Tom Hulce), I really got a lot more out of it.It's a wonderful film, and very real, even though each character's flaws and virtues seem exaggerated. Anyone looking at their own real-life family will probably also discover this variety of oddballs who, all together, make up what reality is all about.Steve Martin and all the others did a great job, but the show was completely stolen by Zachary La Voy, who played Justin, Steve's youngest son. Besides being adorable, he just had a great personality, and was a perfect foil for Steve Martin, Rick Moranis, and all the adults who worried about EVERYTHING. This kid didn't care what ANYONE thought -- he just had a great time doing whatever he wanted to do. You could just imagine him growing up and giving some great perspective to his dad and older brother. (I also remember his appearance on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, where Johnny pointed him out on the monitor and asked him how he looked, and he piped up, Cute!) And he was.  ) And, on the other side, Joaquin (Leaf) Phoenix really showed the acting talent that runs in his family with his portrayal of a very lonely, very troubled preteen who hears his mother and sister say they hate all men because they're scum, so he thinks that's all he is, and the fact that his father completely rejects him seems to confirm it both about his father and himself. There isn't much dialogue regarding this, and Joaquin hardly has any lines at all, but boy, you know exactly what his character is thinking when you see the tears well up in those huge, expressive eyes! (Although as an adult, he does overuse that expression - you see it in pretty much every movie he makes, though most of those are quite good movies.) Keanu made me laugh. It's funny to remember the characters he used to play, and how they were all goofy, doofy teenagers. When I first saw this, I am sure if anyone would have asked me to guess which actor in the movie would become a future big box office ACTION hero, I would have guessed Martha Plimpton WAAAYYY before Keanu! I mean, she was a scary, rather tough-looking broad. But it just goes to show, life is strange! My first boyfriend is now married with a couple kids. I wonder if he remembers this movie at all? I think I might want to buy this one, and if I ever stop writing movie reviews on the Net and go out and find a new man of my own, it'd be great to have this movie around to give myself a little perspective somewhere down the road!

Since the writing isn't initially assured, the tone of the picture swings from comically-credible to cartoonish. The performances by the cast are uneven, too, ranging from fine (Steve Martin, Mary Steenburgen, Tom Hulce and Jason Robards) to dull (Keanu Reeves and Martha Plimpton) to over-exaggerated (Dianne Wiest, who received an Oscar nomination and most of the critical plaudits). Ganz and Mandel aspire to touchy-feely, fuzzy family comedy, so it comes as a surprise that parts of Parenthood are actually rather crass, while Howard, as a director of comedy, needs to reel-in his penchant for cuteness. ** from **** "},{"Title":"dated placebo to the difficulties of parenting","Date":"7 June 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" What leads me to watch this film is Dianne Wiest's singular Oscar-nomination, how rare a mainstream comedy stars Steve Martin could generate an Oscar-caliber performance? Is it as wackily diverting as Marisa Tomei in MY COUSIN VINNY (1992, 7/10) or a rowdy and raunchy scene-stealer as Melissa McCarthy in BRIDESMAIDS (2011, 7/10)? Neither is the case here, thus the answer could only be that it is Academy's honeymoon period with Wiest, who has just won an Oscar 3 years earlier for Woody Allen's HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986, 8/10) and would harvest her second trophy pretty soon in another Allen's satire BULLETS OVER Broadway (1994, 8/10).However, skimming through the credits, it is a quite impressive ensemble here, besides Wiest, there are Oscar winners Steenburgen and Robards, the flash-in-the-pan Oscar nominee Tom Hulce with future leading man Keanu Reeves and Joaquin Phoenix, the burn-too-soon starlet Martha Plimpton, and it is directed by Ron Howard to boot, chances are the film might be more than a crowd-pleasing family fare, and again, I am so wrong!It is a big family, its patriarch Frank (Robards) has four children, the eldest Helen (Wiest), a divorcée with two children, the adolescent Julie (Plimpton) and the introvert teenager Garry (Phoenix); Gil (Martin) is the second, he and his wife Karen (Steenburgen) have 3 children, among whom Kevin (Fisher) is a school-kid has some mood issues and needs special treatment; Susan (Kozak) is the youngest daughter, married to Nathan (Moranis), they have one girl Patty (Schwan), who is under Nathan's unconventional upbringing method and on her fast lane to become a child prodigy; the most problematic one is the youngest son Larry (Hulce), a black sheep in the family, a ne'er-do-well addicts to gambling. Spoiler alert, this is not the end, the family is keeping expanding as if it is a blatant advertisement of unprotected sex. Not exactly an out-and-out comedy, the film sums up a menagerie of headaches of being a parent, all are laboriously entwined in a cumbersome plot, and even though, in the end, everyone is still fearlessly riding on the way to make babies, yeah, being a parent is sometimes irritating, but you know what, no one can escape that, 3 is never enough, 4 might be better, even though he or she may end up being a jerk like Larry. It might be edifying 25 years ago (low birth rate in the state I assume), but now, it seems shamelessly narrow-minded and self- pleasingly irresponsible, we don't buy that now, not everyone suits to be a parent, it is a demanding job and should need a certificate, paraphrasing the dimwitted Tod (Reeves) who expresses the most incisive remark which should be legitimized so that there will be far less lousy parents in the world. On a whole, the film doesn't age well, its content feels uneasily predictable, most of time it persists in stating the obvious and plugging a unified American lifestyle, the cast is inequitable, Martin, Steenburgen, Wiest and Robards all have their moments from time to time, but Hulce and Moranis are tainted by the crappy script. Even grandma's sensible credo (roller coaster Vs. merry-go-around) sounds jarringly self-important near the end, anyway, not my cup-of-tea, period.

But if so, then this one - penned by Babaloo and company - has to be his second best and perhaps his all-time most important.

It shows how even in a close-knit family, each member brings his or her unique personality and perspective.  Jason Robards is the self-made patriarch, with strong opinions about the definition of success.  He clearly approves more of his son Larry (Tom Hulce), a ne'er-do-well con artist who cannot manage his money or his relationships.  Larry talks his father's party line and manages to fool him until the final minutes of the film.  This misplaced favoritism is especially hard on the oldest son, Gil (Steve Martin), who lives his life in a super-responsible manner, taking on guilt for his own failings and everyone else's.  Gil is especially worried about his oldest son who, at age 8, is already neurotic.  Helen (Dianne Wiest) is Gil's divorced sister, trying to raise a teenage daughter (Martha Plimpton) and an adolescent son (Joaquin Phoenix).  The daughter is heavily involved with a good-natured slacker (Keanu Reeves), and Helen is terrified that she is not doing enough to keep her daughter from making an irrevocable mistake with her life.  These stories, and the other subplots in the film, are serious in nature, but Ron Howard, Ganz and Mandel combine their talents to make a fabulously lighthearted product that is also satisfyingly profound. Toward the end of the film, Jason Robards concedes to Steve Martin that parenthood is a job that never ends, no matter how grown-up your kids become.  This movie can reaffirm anyone of any age who is a member of any family.  /r "}{"Title":"Still one of the best","Date":"31 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  As we have grown older and now a grandparent of 3, we watch this often and find that it is very true.

Best of all, though, is the wonderful Dianne Wiest, who earned a deserved Academy Award nomination for her hilarious and touching performance as a single mother with two estranged teenagers.

It's the only way this kind of picture will be made again. This touches upon just about every single issue that a family of today can face, save for the extreme cases(you know, the ones that are treated in talk-shows). It all feels incredible genuine, and we can understand everything that goes on and become emotionally involved in it. The jokes and gags are often hilarious, and this doesn't take the material from the serious subjects. Instead, it comes from situations that we can recognize or imagine finding ourselves in, none of it comes from taking away someone's dignity, and it doesn't at any point try too hard. Every single character is a human being, a person, no one is there merely to be ridiculed. The acting is spot-on, every single performance. Martin and Reeves use their respective schticks some. Even the children are convincing. Howard directs it all beautifully, and there is not a single time where you're unsure if the intent is to be funny or to be dramatic and affect the audience. There is a bit of mild to moderate language, and sex is talked about in pretty strong detail(little is shown, however).

I didn't do any reading to prepare for this movie, Parenthood, and I suppose I expected it to be a lot like Father of the Bride. It isn't. It is a serious movie about the difficulties of being a parent, inspired by director Ron Howard's own upbringing in a large family.Martin is Gil Buckman who didn't have a good experience with his dad Frank (Jason Robards), and tries hard to be a good father, especially for his son David who has some school and social issues. Dianne Weist is good as a single mother with difficult kids, Julie (Martha Plimpton) who is in love with slacker Tod (Keanu Reeves) and Garry (Leaf Phoenix, now known as Joaquin) who is having trouble navigating through puberty. And, in a different parenting generation, Frank (Robards) is having another challenge with his black sheep son, Larry (Tom Hulce) who shows up for yet another bailing out of financial trouble. In a supporting role, Mary Steenburgen is effective as Gil's wife Karen. As well as Rick Moranis as the over zealous parent who is not letting his smart 4 year old daughter be a kid.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Gil is also having problems at work, because being a family man is not a workaholic and, when the next partner position goes to an inferior lawyer, quits his job. Larry shows up unexpectedly, and has a son but no wife. He sees a great business opportunity and sponges $2 grand from dad, only to lose it gambling and will be whacked if he doesn't come up with $26 grand. Dad strikes a compromise, go to work with him and promise to pay off $1 grand a month. At the prospects of actually working, he goes off to Central America for a couple of months but dad knows he will never return. Julie and Tod get married. Garry starts to work out his issues. At the end, not all problems are resolved, but that's the way parenthood really is.

Steve Martin and Mary Steenburgen are having trouble with their oldest son as it appears that the boy may have some psychological problem due to his almost uncontrollable nervous outbursts. Rick Moranis and Harley Jane Kozak appear to be the perfect parents as their young daughter is a genius, but the couple's relationship seems to be struggling as their child's intelligence soars. Then there is the divorced Dianne Wiest (Oscar-nominated) who is having a real tough time with her teenage daughter (Martha Plimpton) and her adolescent son (Joaquin Phoenix). It seems that Plimpton is having lots and lots of sex with the dim-witted Keanu Reeves and Phoenix is becoming interested in dark and disturbing pornographic films. Martin, Kozak and Wiest are all of course siblings and along with youngest brother Tom Hulce look for advice and guidance from their elderly parents led by Jason Robards. It also seems that Hulce, who has a young child out of wedlock, is involved with some shady people as he continues to have a horrible gambling problem that could lead to trouble for himself and those around him. Ron Howard's super direction is right on target here as he accomplishes what he did with Cocoon a few years earlier. He uses a wide range of characters and mixes highly dramatic elements with cunning humor to make a film that works on several important levels. Parenthood is far from a perfect film and it does run a little long, but overall it is a strong body of work that is first-class in all respects. 4 stars out of 5.

In particular, the ending of this movie, in which every woman of childbearing age -- even the teens and the fortysomethings -- was either cradling a baby or pregnant, did not induce tender sentiment in me.

I like watching it to identify the places in my hometown where it was filmed. I normally don't like Ron Howard movies, nor even Steven Martin comedies (he's the same character in every movie). Instead, I consider the real gem of this movie to be Diane Wiest and Jason Robards. They really make this a great movie, despite it's rather generic approach to dealing with parenting issues.The story concerns several families, each related to each other, and each dealing with what would hardly be a typical Ron Howard family--the standard upper-middle class white Hollywood family who's conflicts seem to pale in comparison to those of 'real' people, though the situations might be funny. Steve Martin and Mary Steenburgen are Gil and Karen Buchman, parents of three strange kids. Justin is the primary worry, diagnosed with some sort of anxiety disorder, his father often tries too hard to somehow correct Justin's problems with obsessive parenting. But, what he's really doing, is acting out in response to the lack of fathering his own father gave him.His father is Frank Buchman, played by the terrific, late Jason Robards. He deals with several realms of parenting when his irresponsible son, Larry (Tom Hulce) shows up suddenly on his doorstep and announces he's going to be staying a few months. He tries to play everything off smoothly to hide his gambling addiction and a horrid debt, and his father is struggling with the difficult decisions he has to make with his save his son...or not. And, in a way, Frank seems to try to make up for his own absenteeism with his own boys by taking on a surrogate son, Larry's own son Cool.Then, there's Nathan (Rick Moranis) and Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), who are having difficulties raising their own children (just like everyone else). Nathan spends all his time training their three year-old daughter to be a super-genius, while Susan wants Patty to be allowed to behave like a normal child and not have to worry about all that crap while she's young. Basically, she wants Patty to have a childhood. Plus, she's feeling abandoned by Nathan, who spends nearly all time on his pet project, Patty the genius.The last of our families, and perhaps the funniest in the whole movie is that of Diane Wiest as Helen Buchman and her two kids, Julie (Martha Plimpton) and Gary (Joaquin Phoenix). Diane is a single mother, and one who tries very hard to communicate with her kids, though she does tend to get too judgemental (consistently referring to Todd-Keanu Reeves--Julie's boyfriend as that Todd, etc). Julie is the wild teenager type who thinks she's all sure about growing up so fast and rushes into a difficult relationship with a well-meaning dummy named Todd. Gary, is the quiet kid, who just wants a guy around to talk to as he's at that age of discovering girls and everything. I find this to be a funny movie. Like I said, Diane Wiest as the cynical sarcastic mother trying to get through to her sometimes braindead kids is the best character in the movie and certainly the one with the funniest lines. She's terrific. I love Grandmother Buchman, too, though she hardly get's any dialogue or screen time. What a pity. She's the one who comes up with the life is most interesting if you consider a roller-coaster rather than run for the safety of the ferris wheel. But, the movie, despite being funny, manages to wear out its welcome. For one thing, Steve Martin makes an incredibly annoying character (as usual), and the way he just has to be so damned precise and in-your-face about everything can be quite irritating as well as overriding the role of his wife. Also, there is one sad realization about the whole thing the possibility of getting stuck doing the same thing for the rest of your life, makes me think about how many people hate going to their same job, or same career, day in and day out. But more importantly, the theme of the difficulties of parenthood and life and relationships being no easy task is made quite clear and sometimes, too often. They've taken about every situation they can to create as screwed up a family as possible to make this point. Okay, we get it. By the time the ending arrives, few of the scenes are memorable. Diane Wiest, as Helen Buchman, seems more realistic when she predicts that Julie and Todd don't stand a very good chance of being together very long. Jason Robards, too, as Frank Buchman, when he is told that Larry is going down to Chile to check out something that a business associate told him about (either he was going to get killed by his creditors or he was going to run from them), knows that he'll never see Larry again. Frank is so sure that he even asks Cool if he'd like to stay with him and his wife. But beyond that, everything is so painstakingly ridiculous. Steve Martin and Mary Steenburgen, as Gil and Karen, stand at the school play glaring happily into each others eyes, realizing that hey, even though they've had a hard enough time raising three young children, that a fourth one would be welcomed (why are babies always used as symbols of problem-solving in the movies?). Nevermind how things are going to change when it grows up and behaves as children, and later as teens do (it's just how they are...is it always a problem like this movie suggests?). And the stupid ending with Rick Moranis as Nathan, serenading his wife in front of her science class. Cute, but stupid. And the finale was the just an absolute gag-fest. In order to make everything super peachy (I suppose this is the thrilling part of the roller-coaster ride), they have the finale at the hospital where almost all of the Buchman women are pregnant. What the hell is this suppose to do? It's so stupid and much too much a Hollywood ending if there ever was one.

The screenplay is insightful and clever and well-served by Howard's hand-picked cast, who give uniformly fine performances down the line, with a standout performance from Wiest that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.Thanks to a smart screenplay, sensitive direction, some offbeat casting, and some fun performances, this is a very special comedy that got by a lot of people but is worth checking out. Later turned into a television series.

The performances are great, even Reeves, as another sort of layabout, sponging boyfriend living with girlfriend (Plympton) in her mum's house. The mum, played by Dianne Wiest is such a likable character, but one I could identify with, as it's a very real character, resembling mother's I've met. We see the attitudes from all walks of people, the so common, and real problems that can't be brushed under the carpet, like Steve Martin's little boy, struck with mental illness. I liked the well drawn and different character of Hulce's as an addictive gambler. An interesting angle. He's so bloody convincing, I just now realized where is he these days? He comes back home, cause some bad dudes are after him, while later, would you believe, he pulls his Dad (the great Jason Robards) into one of his schemes. We really see how this addictions got him. There's so many wonderful performances where the film never dulls, as we go from one conflict to another, back and forth. Too, Moranis singing Close To You to girlfriend, (Kozak) you've got to see, while Martin, lands himself another hottie wife, a babe in blue I'll never forget.

Apparently Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel, and Ron Howard got together and came up with the idea and story, then Ganz and Mandel did the screenplay, and Howard directed. The cast is excellent. Remember this is a 1989 movie you'll see Keanu Reeves before anyone knew who he was, Joaquin Phoenix before he knew who he was, Steve Martin, Mary Steenburgen, Dianne Wiest, Jason Robards, Rick Moranis, Tom Hulce, Rance Howard (Ron's father), Clint Howard (Ron's brother), and Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's sister) (and you still don't know who they are). The gist of the movie is that Gil Buckman (played by Steve Martin) and his wife Karen (Mary Steenburgen) have three young kids, and they're driving them crazy. Now let me point out that they and them are indefinite pronouns with no clear antecedent. I'll clear that up for you. The kids are driving the parents crazy and vice versa. The pressure is on little Kevin to do well in school and on the baseball diamond, and the pressure is on Gil to do well at work, which means less time at home. Rivalry among Gil's siblings is rampant, driven by a sociopathic old man (Robards in a sometimes intense role as Frank Buckman) who favors one child among his four.The movie still works today, a testament to the screenplay, the direction, and the cast. It's full enough of laughs to qualify as a comedy, but there are some serious issues going on in the movie where we have lives of not-so-quiet desperation. I hadn't seen the movie since it came out, and I remembered it as good; however, I saw it recently and it was better than I remembered. The ensemble acting is very good. Hulce was excellent as Frank's wayward son Larry. Hulce showed that Larry's manipulation of the old man was built on genuine fondness and regard, exceeded only by Larry's narcissism and need for his dad's love and respect. This is the first role I noticed Dianne Wiest in, and she knocked my socks off. I think she was the best actor in the movie. Keanu Reeves showed his talent clearly in his role as the would-be boyfriend of Wiest's daughter (played by Martha Plimpton).Don't worry about the plot. There's not so much a story arch as a series of scenes for the characters to muddle through; it all ends with happiness, everyone having muddled through. Parenthood is the hook on which the movie is hung, but there's enough going on that even nonparents will be hooked as well. It's a quietly (well, not too quiet) excellent movie for grownups to laugh at themselves about.

First came Splash, an utterly winning comedy that made a star out of Tom Hanks, and then Parenthood, a well-written ensemble dramedy about navigating the tricky waters of child rearing that features a fantastic cast.Steve Martin and Mary Steenburgen anchor the film as the grounded, reliable married couple at the film's center, with much of the comedy being supplied by Dianne Wiest, playing Martin's sister, and Rick Moranis, playing his type-A brother-in-law. Wiest especially steals the show as a divorcée at her wit's end trying desperately to keep her wild child daughter (Martha Plimpton) and recluse son (a young Joaquin Phoenix) in check.The film also features Tom Hulce, excellent as yet a fourth sibling with a gambling addiction, and the expert Jason Robards, as the tyrannical family patriarch.The film is episodic in nature, full of beautifully realized individual moments.

However on second viewing I didn't have any preconceptions about what the film was going to be and as a result I enjoyed it far, far more. I was surprised at the level of maturity there WAS in the film; how well it balances the realistic family situations while remaining quite humorous.From the onset it's clear the film has a very dry ironic sense of humor -- adult, actually. The scene with Martin in the body of a child talking to the hot dog vendor at a ball game is classic stuff and a superb example of the style in this movie.Rick Moranis is really funny as the first-time father whose daughter is treated like Little Jack in Meet the Fockers -- he plays her classical music, teaches her advanced mathematics and grammar, and refrains her from playing with other children. The scene where Martin pretends to pull his thumb off and she freaks out is very good.Overall Parenthood will disappoint you if you're expecting a laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy. However if you want something a bit deeper and more poignant than your average Steve Martin comedy, this is a good example of how well Martin is at starring as straight characters and an honest examination of parenthood.

But Gil and wife Karen (Mary Steenburgen), as every couple, have their own problems with career demands, family issues and 3 young kids with their own idiosyncrasies and developmental problems.As you might guess the cast is quite stellar and probably wouldn't be possible in this day and age of inflated salaries and egos, Parenthood isn't so much an 'event film' as one which shows the various generations dealing with raising kids of various ages in their own ways.Some of the occurrences and developments in the film are quite serious in tone but obviously dealt with in amusing fashion. While teenage angst, sex and domineering parents might seem like easy targets for comedy they also manage to squeeze a chuckle or two from broken and breaking relationships and neglectful parents.The entire cast does well at providing carefully rendered characters, Steve Martin as always provides the deadpan laughs, the exception being the immortal kid's birthday party scene where he is allowed to run wild and crazy as Cowboy Gil the most amusing party entertainment on film.Hulce is unlikable as the fast talking deadbeat Larry &#x96; which is the point, and Weist is very good as the downtrodden and almost desperate single Mum Helen trying to juggle 2 growing kids and a moronic live in boyfriend/husband to her daughter played by Keanu Reeves, who at the time was still embracing his doofus image.It's hard to talk about Parenthood in more detail, the humour is created through the low key realistic situations and how those going through them deal with them. Aside from the Cowboy Gil scene there aren't too many laugh out loud moments but there are numerous chuckles to be had and the film quite accurately proves what Robards' character says near the end; 'once you start you never stop being a parent'.Final Rating &#x96; 7.5 / 10.

Gil(Steve Martin)and Karen Buckman(Mary Steenburgen)face every possible emotion and situation that comes with raising children. The story line features a college drop-out, a perplexed single mom and a high-toned couple dealing with an overachiever. And Jason Robards represents the older generation. The cast also features the apt talents of Dianne Wiest, Rick Moranis, Martha Plimpton, Joaquin Phoenix, Keanu Reeves and Tom Hulce. Martin and Wiest were outstanding. On the other hand, I found Hulce just plain irritating. PARENTHOOD is to not be compared to a self-help book.

So I was happy when it finally wended its way to the top of my Netflix queue. I am a big fan of Steven Martin, and I was hoping that this would be a movie that would showcase his dramatic side in the way that certain movies showcased Bill Murray as a serious actor.I was, as the title of this review says, sadly disappointed. It's a rare movie, I suppose, that manages to balance comedy and drama, and this one failed in that regard. The dramatic element seemed trite and exaggerated it was hard to take the serious side seriously because it was so overboard (the Rick Moranis family, e.g.). Then, played off against this, the parts that did force a laugh seemed somewhat juvenile. Finally, it's all wrapped together with the absolutely the most overdone movie cliché of the century--underdog kid catches winning fly ball.

Trying to make a movie of an everyday life is never easy, and let's face it - Ron Howard does a terrible job here. The characters are as annoying as they get, and as unbelievable as they get. This makes for an indigestible concoction - supposedly real life with unreal characters. And to be honest, I can not recall a movie with more annoying characters than this one. Every appearance of either Dianne Wiest or Mary Steenburgen on screen made me shut my eyes and mute the TV. There are three reasons for this though. The first one is the terrible script. The second one is awful directing. And last, but not the least, is the ridiculously pathetic acting. I was never a fan of Steve Martin whose acting abilities to me are as shallow as a puddle, but the rest of the cast make him stand out simply by being even worse. The only exception is, of course, Jason Robards who is in a league of his own here. Actually, in some of his scenes I felt like I was watching a different movie all together, a smart, touching, sometimes funny movie. And then it was back to Steve Martin and his crowd... One last point to make. (Here be spoilers). Could there be a more stereotypical, clichéd and silly ending? The boy catches the ball, the father gets the promotion, the marriages are saved, everybody happily procreates, and the family of morons lives on. God bless America. Wow. What's this supposed to teach us? (Spoilers end).Conclusion. Avoid it like the plague. The only reason I gave it a 3 out of 10 is Jason Robards. The rest of it gets a 1.

All the funny stuff happens within the first 10 or so minutes into this one and after that there are just one or two more laughs scattered here and there.  For the most part I found this movie way to serious, and it wasn't entertaining to me.  I can see how others can relate to it, but I am a single guy with no kids or girlfriend...so I cannot really relate to it.  If you are a parent though it might be worth your while to ignore this review and go ahead and watch the movie.

I think that, had it settled on one or the other, it could have been a much better film, but the often-sudden switch from comedy to drama leaves a bitter taste.

C'mon!!","Date":"18 September 2005","Score":"2 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I would have rated this movie higher but the ending is what spoiled it for me. Everyone has a brand new baby to raise. Yippee!!! The answer to all their problems, prayers, etc... Otherwise, if only one set of parents had a baby and the rest did not, then the others couldn't lead fulfilled productive lives with all that they had right then? Right? Is that the message here? More means better? I found the ending incredibly cheesy after watching this otherwise poignant, often funny, and as true to life of a parenting movie I've seen. Great performances particularly by Jason Robards and Dianne Wiest.I wonder what would happen if the Buckmans had decided on an abortion. Gee, that would have really been hard to keep the lighter comedic element going. And for those parents who have only children, the message is, that's just not good enough folks. The only child character of the Huffner's was only strange because of the parenting she was getting from freaky Huffner, played by Moranis. So, if his wife was so worried about how he's raising their child, why is she insistent they have another one, and soon!!! Where is the logic there? I realize this movie was intended to be more of a feel good movie for parents, and families, young and old alike. It was just too formulaic and predictable and the ending was the real kicker. The movie was called Parenthood for a reason and gee, I guess the only ending could be one with a new crop of babies for everyone!!

I watched it a couple of nights ago and even gave it time to show it's self in a better light with deeper contemplation. Steve Martin's performance left me flat. It was wooden and missing many of the finer nuances of his other roles, ie George Banks in the Father of the Bride movies. Keanu Reeves performance as Tod left a bad taste in my mouth that I still haven't been able to get rid of. Although I've never been a fan of his in particular this would have left me avoiding his future films had I seen it prior to Speed. Jason Robards was a high note in an otherwise flat movie. This film was a strain from the start, though in exaggeration it is realistic, parents should be able to relate to the feelings of the characters, it's not ENTERTAINING. The directing of Ron Howard was fine as usual, however it was the script and acting of a few that needed retooling in this one.

It has it's moments, but it's not the roller-coaster Grandma would wish for. Well-crafted and competent, the gentle pace and mild comedy will keep you amused rather than excited, interested rather than engrossed in the lives of people who are quickly forgotten once the final credits have rolled.Robards is easily the pick of the bunch, not that he's remotely challenged here. Martin plays down the slapstick and is all the better for it. Wiest & Steenburgen add to his slushiness & sentimentality. Keanu just carried on where he left off with Ted, but he shares a few good scenes with a young Joaquin Phoenix. Moranis doesn't shine, and Plimpton doesn't get a chance too - which is a shame because she shows great potential.It's a good example of it's type and I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't ever want to watch it again. One for a lazy, rainy day with a loved one perhaps.

Persuading people who already have three kids to have another one?  Let's make like they're doughnuts, and have a dozen, says Steve Martin sarcastically - but Martin and fellow comic Rick Moranis are in the unfortunate position of being trapped in a movie in which nobody, not even the director, takes any notice of them when they're saying something that runs counter to the message they were hired to preach.  Moranis and Martin are voices of sanity, and the most sympathetic people present.  But the script keeps betraying them.Moranis plays Nathan Merrick, a father who wants his daughter to be an only child for at least five years - because this increases her chances of being intelligent and capable, and may even help her become a genius.  His wife is opposed to this plan.  Why?  Because, she snaps, their daughter is not some PRODUCT!  -Okay, cheap retorts aside, why is she opposed to this plan?  Because she wants another child, NOW.  Since the film is set in some weird kind of Catholic universe, in which any kind of procreative restraint is a sin, she gets her way.There's a scene that's meant to be amusing - to be fair, it IS amusing - in which Nathan is teaching his daughter the names of the elements while Mozart is being played in the background.  -Well, why not?  Mozart himself was a child prodigy who grew up on a healthy diet of Haydn; so was Beethoven.  Anyone born today with the capacity to become as great would choke on The Wiggles, or some such.  Active steps are needed to prevent this.  Good on Nathan, I say.But this is a side issue.  The film's central goal is to persuade us - you, me, and everyone else - to go forth and multiply.  Pay no attention to the fact most of the film's running time is devoted to the down side of procreating.  It never looks at this down side very closely; and anyway, it's all a cunning ploy.  At the end, everyone has a spanking new baby, and they all look so HAPPY.  (Even an uncoupled widower who's ancestor to over half the cast already and who may even be old enough to be infertile finds himself saddled with a fresh kid.  What hope is there for the rest of us?)It's the roller coaster story that does it.  Don't ask about the roller coaster story.  I can't bring myself to repeat it.  A minute ago I was so CONFUSED about life.  Then Grandma came along with her roller coaster story, and now, everything's okay!  When Steve Martin says this he's being sarcastic, but the sarcasm is only Ron Howard's way of disguising the fact that this really is what we're meant to think.  (Steve Martin is, as usual, funny, but on the whole he needed better jokes.  It's a shame.  Martin the performer is talented in at least three ways he can act, he can be hilarious, and he can save weak material when nobody else in the world can.  We've seen him at work on that third thing too often.)Ron Howard is far from being a great director, but when he made Parenthood he was clearly at his best.  A pity he chose that moment, of all moments, to preach.  And the sermon he chose could hardly have been more ill-judged.P.S.  The title really ought to have been Fatherhood.  Even the one female-heavy plot strand (he Lampkins saga) was as much concerned with fathers as with mothers.  Not that I'm complaining - the film is over two hours long as it is.  If, for every father, there had been an equally prominent mother ... well, let's just be grateful that there isn't. "}]
