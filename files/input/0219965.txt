[{"Title":"Funny, entertaining and original","Date":"7 June 2002","Score":"49 out of 58 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  This could've been just another Bonnie and Clyde-style crime caper, but it's more than that.  Bandits starts out as a slick action-comedy and evolves into a sweet romantic comedy.  When I found out Barry Levinson was the director, I assumed the film would be at least halfway decent.  Levinson has a keen eye for character development, and that's one of the things that interested me.  Normally, a film like this would be consisted of cut-and-dry, stereotypical characters, but we gradually fall in love these three characters.  After reading the rave reviews (Joel Siegel voted this as one of the best films of the year), despite poor box office numbers, I had high expectations for this film--higher than they were after watching the trailer.  For some reason, this just doesn't look like a film that would receive 4-star reviews.  Now that I have seen it, I can't regard it as a 4-star film, but it's good and entertaining and I wasn't disappointed. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton make a great team--they really have an impeccable chemistry.  I hope to see them teamed up again in the future.  They have the potential to be the next Martin and Lewis.  Billy Bob especially steals the film, playing a neurotic Woody Allen-type.  He is absolutely hilarious!  Bruce flashes his trademark grin and speaks in his usual soft tone, but his role doesn't exactly require the talents of Pacino or DeNiro.  Still, Bruce is entertaining and his constant banter with Billy Bob makes the experience even more entertaining.  And last but not least, I will mention Cate Blanchett, who gives another incredible performance.  I was lucky enough to rent 2 Cate Blanchett movies--this film and The Gift--by coincidence.  I got to see her sweet, charming performance in Bandits as well as her powerful dramatic performance in The Gift.  Just watching those 2 films, gives me a great idea of her scope as an actress.  It's sometimes hard to believe she's an Australian actress.  How she pulls off such an impeccable American accent--I don't know.  I think if I were to hear her speak in an Australian accent, I'd think she's feigning it.  Well, Blanchett perfectly completes the trio of actors, and has a great chemistry with the 2 male leads.  And it's great to see that Willis, Thornton and Blanchett all seem like they're having fun.  When first watching this movie, I found some of the bank robberies--though very slick and original--to be quite implausible.  If the film wasn't as charming and likable, I'd probably have a difficult time suspending disbelief.  But then I found out the story of the Sleepover Bandits was actually based on a real duo of bank robbers.  Of course, this is nowhere close to a biopic and most of the story is obviously fiction, the concept of these two guys sleeping over the bank managers' houses and robbing their banks the next morning was based on truth.  Why these managers didn't call the cops while the two guys weren't watching or why they didn't try to strangle the two guys in their sleep--I don't know.  The truth really is stranger than fiction.  But the bandits did have an interesting gimmick  they only robbed banks, since the money belonged to the government; they never snatched money from people's pockets.  There's actually a scene in the movie in which they bust out of prison and rob a lady's car.  Willis hands the lady her pocketbook and says, Don't forget your pocketbook.  The film evolves into a romantic comedy during the second half.  I guess that's why audiences were disappointed--they probably expected a sheer action-comedy/crime caper and not a romantic comedy.  But I think the fact that the screenwriter and Levinson stretched this out into a romantic comedy made it all the more better.  It added new dimensions, and helped us better fall in love with these amiable characters.  It was fun watching the strong and macho Willis vie lanky pushover Thornton over the love of alluring Blanchett.  It creates an interesting conflict, and spawns some very funny scenes.  The film concludes, picking up from where it left off in the beginning--which is the two bandits pulling off their last bank robbery.  The twist ending is nifty and unpredictable, and left me satisfied.  Though this is basically a feel-good comedy that kept me smiling, there's no cheap schmaltz or trashy sentiment.  That's what happens when you're under the wing of a great director.  This is not an excellent film, like some critics said--I don't think any movie that contains Blanchett's horrible rendition of Walk on By deserves to be regarded as excellent (Cate should DEFINITELY stick to acting!)--but it's good, solid entertainment.  And I love the use of U2's Beautiful Day!My score  7 (out of 10)      "},{"Title":"Energetic, romantic fun.

I can see it now young, influential criminals holding up entire banks with magic markers. Certain things in this movie make such perfect sense, we wonder why nobody's thought of them before.Even the casting makes perfect sense. Who better to play a handsome, spontaneous ladies man than Bruce Willis? And who could portray an intelligent, hypochondriac better than Billy Bob Thornton? Together, these two characters make the perfect man. Of course, it's only a matter of time before a woman becomes involved and finds herself split between the two.But Bandits is anything but your average run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. Willis and Thornton play Joe Blake and Terry Collins, two criminals in a high security prison. As the movie opens, they escape from prison in such a way that probably makes the other prisoners hit themselves on the head and ask Why didn't I think of that?Just as soon as they switch getaway cars, Joe and Terry rob a bank to finance their upcoming adventures. After hooking up with an old friend of Joe's, a wannabe stuntman played by Troy Garity, the criminals devise a foolproof plan to rob banks they take the bank manager hostage the night before a heist, sleep over at his house, then go into the bank with him the next morning before business hours. No unexpected holdups. No complications. Just take the money and leave before the first customer arrives.The Joe and Terry dream of escaping to a tropical location and opening a margarita bar. Their success as bank robbers eventually puts them at the top of the FBI's most wanted list. Things become even more complicated when Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett) runs into one of the crooks and wants to become a part of their lifestyle. When she falls in love with both men, the situation really starts to heat up. Oscar-winner Barry Levinsion gives Bandits a humble sense of reality. He doesn't place Joe and Terry on a pedestal and treat them like superheroes; he actually opens the film revealing their presumed demise. Although in interviews he explains that he was initially unsure how to handle the material, his uncertainty does not show in the final production. He has found the perfect blend of romance, action, and comedy to satisfy all tastes and styles. Bandits opens with a bookend revealing parts of the film's finale. This doesn't really work. Normally, this technique is used when a movie is more about a journey than what actually happens at the end. Although Bandits is indeed more about a journey, the movie's structure does not support such an opening. It doesn't provide us with enough information to work effectively, and, after a final twist at the very end, this technique seems pointless since it doesn't reveal the actual ending, anyway. Nonetheless, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett deliver fine performances, forming a charismatic, unlikely love triangle. Troy Garity, gleeful and eccentric, steals all of his scenes in memorable supporting role. Despite the various structural flaws, the cast alone is enough to redeem Bandits as an above average comic adventure. It's one of the year's most fun surprises.

If you appreciate deeper levels of subtlety and are prepared to suspend hard-nosed reality for the duration, you will love this one. Reminds me of Cohen Bros movies. If you are prepared to relax into it and let the movie take you where IT goes, you are in for a good ride. For those that want to predict a movie and try and show some perceived level of intellectual superiority by telling the person next to them what is about to happen just before it happens (yes - we know they exist), I would hazard a guess that you will not enjoy this movie. Having said that, I found the movie beautiful in the detail. This is not about grandiose plot, high speed chases and super cool cunning people. This is accidental and bumbling happenstance where random events are delightfully used. Truck, garage door etc. I carried with me the finer and more easily lost details of each character and I found they surprised me and delighted me with often times whimsical twists and subtle growth/support. I didn't find any huge character surprises or character twists, just good solid development, the kind where you can leave your opinions open to the end. Times like the late night rendezvous at the juke box joint and what happens when Bob tries to dance. Perfect. I walked out with a smile on my face, well amused and very much liking the attention to detail in character, shots, lighting, soundtrack etc. Not edge of the seat, sit back and relax.Nice one.

They rob banks to get their income, intertwine with a run-away housewife, and are, of course, chased by the law. From the very beginning the movie takes off with such exciting momentum one may wonder if it will keep its pace until the closing scene; yet it does. Terrific turns by Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett, and Troy Garrity make this the best film of its kind--where we root for the bad guys--since early cinema. Simply excellent.

They kidnap the bank manager,take him to work the following morning and get him to open the vault without the complications of tellers and customers. This works successfully until they run into Kate (played to perfection by Cate Blanchett in an overlooked role).Kate is an overworked stressed out housewife who decides she needs some action in her dull life. She forms a romantic relationship with Joe and starts to rob banks with them, a little extreme for a mid- life crisis don't you think?. Later in the film she falls for Terry. Cate becomes torn between the two and a rift is formed between the thieves. This is the interesting dilemma explored in this film as the two cannot afford to be torn apart as all they have in life is each other.This film is funnier than you would expect, it plays more as a comedy than a crime film. Willis nicely escapes his cop persona in the role of Smooth likable Joe Blake. Thornton is superbly funny as Collins, the neurotic paranoid partner. As aforementioned, Blanchett is perfect as the love interest.The ending is enjoyable if not a little expected. The one big flaw in this film is that Thornton's character, though entertaining is clearly not the criminal type. Though the relationship between the two main characters is touching.Bandits is a funny, enjoyable, original comedy that I recommend to everyone. Go out and see this film. There will hardly be a moment in it that you will not adore.

The story is complex enough to keep your attention right up until the surprise ending. Beyond that, though, this is an ensemble character study with four wonderful actors and it is a pleasure to watch them work. Bruce Willis is a tough guy with a believable sensitive side. Billy Bob Thornton is a hypochondriac with a penchant for making trivial observations at extremely critical times. Billy Bob enjoys doing different characters and this is a memorable one. Cate Blanchett is a beautiful woman running from a failed marriage who falls in love with both men. Troy Garity is a cowboy stunt man whose lapses in judgment are made forgivable by his love for his work. This is, for Garity, a very different character from role in Barbershop. The movie is beautifully filmed in interesting places and there are even a few classy automobiles around. If you enjoy a good story, some action, and good actors working well together, I recommend that you rent this one.

The only thing I knew about it was that it was a crime-comedy, and that Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton portrayed the leads. I didn't think it would be so funny and thoroughly entertaining. The idea is somewhat original, though slightly derivative of movies like Bonnie and Clyde. The plot is very good; it details the various bank-robberies of two very different partners in crime. The pace is very good too, though I found parts of the last half hour of film somewhat dragging. The acting is great; Bruce Willis is great as the aggressive and determined robber, Billy Bob Thornton does a great job as the hypochondriac and very nervous robber, and Cate Blanchett gives a great performance as the slightly neurotic hostage who eventually falls in love with both robbers. The characters are well-written and credible. The comedy, crime and drama was well-integrated, and well-done. I didn't care too much for the romance angle, though, but, for what it's worth, it's not a bad one, and definitely not the worst I've seen. The actors have great on-screen chemistry, and they are well-casted. I liked the way the story was told; it left you thinking that you were merely following the events leading up to the end, but then, during the last few minutes, there is an excellent twist, which took me entirely by surprise, and made a great ending for a great film. Considering that the film is a PG-13 rated, two-hour long comedy which deals with crime, and has some drama integrated in it, it's really good. It's very funny, entertaining, and original. The humor is well-done, rarely falls flat, and mostly works great in the film. I liked that they mostly dodged stereotypes and cliches, instead of wallowing in them, like many other comedies nowadays do. I recommend it to fans of comedies, crime related films and dramas. To a lesser extent, it's also recommendable to fans of romance. Most general movie fans should also enjoy this, at least to some extent. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Entertaining Comedy","Date":"17 April 2003","Score":"19 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Fun but no great shakes.

Their method of bank robbery is rather considerate, all things considered, and kind of touching.  They visit the bank president the night before and get in with his cooperation.  Why this happens without incident is anyone's guess, but I don't think its supposed to be deep or insightful or anything, and I don't mean that it insults the audience either.Cate Blanchett is along for the ride, eventually.  She doesn't belong with them, or anyone else, but she adds a lot of fun.I'd rate Billy Bob's hypochondriac in this alongside Woody Allen's in Hannah And Her Sisters.  7/10.

You end up rooting for them as the movie progresses. Director Barry Levinson is brilliant as he makes his robbers become the heroes while the police are deemed the bad guys.Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) are inmates who partner up in an escape from prison by stealing a cement truck. Once out, they decide to rob a bank by using a yellow highlighter as their sole weapon. In order to fulfill their much longed for dream of opening a nightclub in Mexico, they expertly plot a series of bank robberies. To secure them from ever being captured, the plan is to enter the home of the bank manager the night before the robbery, sleep over and escort that person to work the next morning. All is well until an unstable woman named Kate (Cate Blanchett) enters the game by hitting Terry with her car. After much quarreling, the duo decides to keep the woman on board, allowing her to join in the fiasco. Their title quickly becomes The Sleepover Bandits as a TV tabloid show, Criminals at Large, follows their every move.Willis and Thornton make a marvelous team. Opposite in every way possible, Joe is the sexy, strong criminal while Terry harbors the neurotic brain behind the operation. Thornton's choices of his character's facial ticks, his compulsive manner and nervousness are brilliant in its exploration. Willis is pretty much the same aggressive man going for the girl (Kate) and yes, he succeeds. Although, it's nice to see that macho Joe doesn't get to keep pretty Kate. He must share her after she falls for his other half, Terry. The movie takes a turn after Kate professes her love to both men. Now, the movie focuses less on the robberies and more on who gets to keep Kate. She says that she cannot decide between the two and that together, they make the perfect man.Cate Blanchett is an extraordinary actress but is a bit too crazed in this movie, going overboard with her character as a dissatisfied housewife. At times, you feel compassion towards her character and at others, you just want her to shut up. Maybe this is what she intended but it doesn't make her character too lovable. Blanchett shows her vulnerable, free-spirited side while singing a hilariously disastrous rendition of Walk On By. This scene follows along the lines of Cameron Diaz's impromptu version of I Just Don't Know from My Best Friend's Wedding.Worth mentioning is the lesser-known actor, Troy Garity, as Joe's cousin Harvey, whom Joe talks into joining the gang. Harvey is an aspiring LA stuntman who ends up driving the getaway car for each heist. While perfectly fitting in between Thornton and Willis, Garity brings very amusing nimrod qualities to Harvey as we watch him fall off buildings and set himself ablaze.While the movie is cute and seemingly funny, in its entirety, it is too long. Cuts to the tabloid show Criminals at Large are not necessary to further any plot. Neither are flashbacks from the ending scene as a narration for the entire movie. It's nice to use that technique of having the characters narrate the movie from the end but it doesn't help any here. Plus we've already seen it done many times and if removed, wouldn't affect the movie at all. It would just tighten it. Otherwise, this movie is a great escape for the country right now, a nice dose of comedy mixed in with a pinch of action and voilá, you have America smiling.

He does some interesting camera management, which keeps us occupied. And he does understand what's going on, as the writing is pretty cleverly structured. He just has no center.The cleverness comes from two things the elaborate framing and Ms Cate's games.The framing is rather studied We are given two Dylan songs right off the bat that concern someone acting out well enough that the act becomes life. A Dylan strength, at least before the fundamentalist excesses. Then we actually have Kate the character who wants to become a singer, and this develops first into a fantasy and then beyond to the con. Song lyrics both annotate the action and are woven into the dialog. I'll bet the script idea started with those Dylan songs.We have the conventional framing of a noir-narrator's flashback. Ho Hum, but that is deftly woven into another common device, the film as an extension of a film within itself a televised interview that contains the `story.' Which incidentally is partly told through bank surveillance cameras -- and in one case, the camera of someone filming singers! Very good folding joke. More one character (Billy) is highly suggestable, so the other character (Bruce) toys with him by feeding him suggestions about `dis-eases' that then become real.This is pretty crafty stuff, and the execution is well conceived in the casting too Bruce and Billy are superficial actors. They act by `putting on' their characters -- while keeping their `real' selves just visible. The `real' Bruce often winks out at the audience in his roles, which is something we post-postmodern audiences like. So we pay them truckloads of dough. What they play here is -- you guessed it, men who put on disguises and with genteel manners walk away with scads of cash.It only works because of Cate, who is one of the three most intelligent actresses in film today. She comes to a role by actually transforming her soul, at least a much of it as we can see. So when she is bereft, looking for an alternate reality, we not only believe, we climb aboard. She is so charming and open we believe -- and conspire in -- creating the film to suit her needs, even if it means concocting these two prancing oafs.Bottom line even Levinson's clumsiness cannot dampen the conspiracy the gifted Cate weaves with this clever writer.

Maybe Harley Peyton's original screenplay was quirky, funny and entertaining (I always am prepared to give the writer the benefit of the doubt), but in these hands, and with this cast, it unexpectedly has become one of the most annoying, tiresome vanity projects ever made.I have read and seen interviews where Willis, Thornton, and Blanchett have all talked about being the best of pals, and have so much respect for each other, and how this project was a blast to make. And this, unfortunately, is all too apparent in the finished project. There is an obvious amount of adlibbing going on, scenes are allowed to run beyond the point of tedium, and you can almost hear the cries of That was cool! or You were wonderful!, backed up by cast and crew laughing their socks off, between every single scene. I am certain there are loads of out-takes from this movie that are more entertaining than the movie itself.And the butt of this great joke is Joe Public, duped by the big names into putting down hard earned cash to watch what is, ultimately, a big, boring home movie. If the cast want to self indulge so desperately, don't do it at everyone else's (including the studio accountants) expense.There are moments of hope the supporting cast (especially Richard Riehle as a bank manager who responds hilariously to threats and stress) are quite good when the three stars can deflate their egos enough to get out of the way. And there are some good songs. But, all in all, this movie should be a lesson for all involved Blanchett and Thornton will, I'm sure, redeem themselves with their next projects; but Willis (with superduds like The Kid and Breakfast of Champions on his CV) and Levinson (a talented director who seems to have lost it big time with turkeys like this and An Everlasting Piece) really need to get their acts together and produce something of real entertainment value.Because, quite honestly, this ranks right down there with Pearl Harbor as the worst movie of 2001.

Watching B & BB don dopey disguises once is good for a grin but, when you realise that this running gag is essentially the movie's comic highpoint and that we're meant to find the idea of them repeatedly kidnapping bank managers and sleeping over with their family the night before pulling the heists hilarious (don't worry, they don't rape their wives or douse their kids in petrol - Billy Bob's culinary tips to one man's wife is about as hostile as they get), you get a measure of the level of invention in a work which outstays its welcome well before the overstretched two hour running time is up. Opening with a bank hostage setup which is surprisingly similar to the superior SWORDFISH (yep, this rates so low that Travolta's lightweight high-tech caper movie shines in comparison), boasting a lame AOR soundtrack (complete with  supposedly ironic deconstruction of Bonnie Tyler lyrics - give me Patrick Bateman's take on Phil Collins any day), and drawing attention to the fact that it's plot makes no sense even on its own tarnished terms (a bank hostage remarks that she knows they'll be safe as B & BB are known for preserving the lives of their victims, which begs the inevitable question 'Why don't the hostages merely overpower their armed captors?'), this is the type of film which evaporates in the mind before it's reached a lame 'twist' ending. You'd be far better off renting Redford and Newman's wittier and snappier buddy-caper Western which, at least, imbued its cast of characters with more than a smattering of irritating mannerisms to pass for personality, had entertainment value to burn and played fair with the fade-out.

Bruce Willis as Joe Blake, though one of his least action packed roles is easily one of his most menacing, but funny and charming at the same time. Billy Bob Thornton as his high strung paranoid partner Terry Collins is unforgettable and hilarious, and it works great with Bruce. I've watched this 100 times and still watch it whenever it's on.

Levinson starts with a close shot of her as she peers into her refrigerator and he captured those luminous wolfen eyes Cate is known for, then she launched into an improv sing-a-long to Bonnie Tyler's I Need a Hero as she fashioned dinner for her husband - and it's a show-stopper. you sit forward in your chair in anticipation of how her life will intersect with Billy Bob and Bruce Willis and when it does, you laugh until you cry. my favorite line from Cate comes as she weaves in and out of traffic at a hundred miles an hour and Billy Bob pleads with her to pull over and let him out. she says, i'm not crazy, i'm unhappy, and there's a difference, as she roars through traffic, then roars through their lives like a summer fire tearing through a wheat field ...it's a treat to watch her creates such an unforgettable character.i liked all of the minor roles, from Harvey dog Pollard, to the woman who played the bank manager who wouldn't give Bruce Willis the money. and pink, with those big blue eyes and breck girl hair played a memorable, albeit, minor part.the film obviously falls down with the LAPD's inexplicable lapse in security at the end. nothing and no one would have left their perimeter until the LAFD EMT people pronounced the obvious, and then the county coroner would have had to agree with their pronouncement of death, let the LAPD know that it apparently was by their own hands, and then they'd have put place markers down for the shell casings, taken photos up the gazoo, and then and only then would those bodies have been moved. and even then they probably would have been given the ambulance, or the coroner's van a three to six car LAPD escort. minor point.i loved the film even though i saw it for the first time on DVD, not on the big screen and since, at this point, that's probably where you will see it, i highly recommend its purchase. i put it right back on, and watched it a second time, and liked it more the second time. if Hollywood made films like this every time they tried, with smart dialogue, great acting, and a get out of the way and let the talent work attitude by Levinson, they'd make more money than Saudi oil princes.no, it's not Shawshank but i'd put it only a slight notch beneath Get Shorty and that's high praise. this is a very entertaining film and in some places, it's laugh out loud funny. a good way to judge films like this are scene by scene, and i can't recall a weak scene in the film. they're all good, and some, like Cate's singing in the kitchen, and Willis and Kate dancing on the beach at night (shot through the window of their cottage) are as good as it gets. everyone who worked on the film should be proud of their efforts. i bought it on DVD so i can have a good laugh whenever i'm so inclined and i've been so inclined three times since the purchase. i say, bravo.

With a guy like Barry Levinson directing, having classic comedies like Diner and Toys, (another ill-received winner) under his belt and dramedies like Rain Man, you know you will be entertained. If you still feel unsure after finding out it stars Bruce Willis and two of the best actors working today in Billy Bob Thornton, (when not playing the vulgar schlub he has lately), and Cate Blanchett, you don't enjoy cinema. This trifecta of actors really shine together causing laughs at every turn while still grounding the film enough to keep the serious criminal consequences relevant.Breaking out of jail on a whim, Joe (Willis) and Terry (Thornton) find themselves free men needing money. They decide to rob banks long enough to make a nest egg to run a hotel/ club down in Mexico; yes that is where they are keeping Acapaulco these days. They become the sleepover bandits as they kidnap the bank manager the night before the crime so as to take the money without hostages causing a problem. Just the satirical notion of these hardened criminals becoming overnight celebrities where bank managers revel in the thought that they can be victims, is funny enough. Throw in Cate Blanchett's manic-depressive housewife on her last thread Kate, and we have some really laugh-out-loud hijinks. When she is singing to cheesy 80's Bonnie Tyler music while cooking and driving, you can see the amazing comic timing she possesses to go along with the dramatic chops she usually shows. One of our most versatile actresses, maybe not quite deserving of the Oscar last year, but definitely worthy of the Oscar-winner status, there hasn't been a bad performance by her that I have seen. I can't wait until later this year when she joins heavyweights Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga with their emotional epic Babel.Bruce Willis shows again that playing against his tough-guy type is really where he succeeds best. Joe has all the charisma and muscle of an action hero, but also the sarcasm and wit to really poke fun at the stereotype. Thornton gives a magnificently physically showing as the hyperchondriac Terry. His idiosynchrsies are hilarious to watch and the banter with both Joe and Kate is perfect. There are so many one-liners that spew from his fast-talking, too smart for his own safety mind. You know the hardest thing about being smart? You pretty much know what's gonna happen next. There's no suspense. He also has the uncanny demeanor to switch personas mid-sentence, acting tough and then, when ridiculed about his disguise, almost quietly, as though to a confidant, asking if it really is that bad.Rounding out the comic genius is relative newcomer Troy Garity. His stuntman is the ultimate stereotypical guy's guy whom needs to be babysat at every turn by the two criminal minds. The childlike fascination is perpetually ingrained into his features and expressions as he is just a kid in a candy store. Garity's charm makes the role successful and an integral part to the story. Credit writer Harley Peyton for loading his script with so many disparate characters which when mixed together work together like clockwork. After writing ensemble work with quirky roles in the likes of TV show Twin Peaks, one can see why. Hopefully we will be able to see more from him in the future, and also more like this from Barry Levinson, who's last film Envy was so bad it was released after a hiatus on the shelf for two years.

I was surprised how much I had forgotten. Even though I did remember several key moments, I found this film to be entertaining enough to continue watching until the end. But only this time I payed more attention to the story, the acting and as much details as possible and I found this movie to be not only entertaining, but also quite creative and funny.The actors chosen for this movie are probaby perfect, because I cannot come up with different actors that would fit well in this movie. The chemistry between Willis, the tough guy, and Thorton, the clever yet a bit crazy guy, is genuine and very entertaining. Adding Blanchett, the mentally unstable woman, only creates more possibilities for events.Although the storyline isn't anything unique or even special there are several moments in this movie that really are the result of creative thinking on the writers behalf. Some of these moments do require some thinking, but the majority of the runtime is pure entertainment.BANDITS is a plain, yet very entertaining action, comedy and a bit of drama movie.

This is a film you can do whatever you like with. You can analyze it as a feminist piece or a story about love (Blanchett goes on to romance the two bank-robbers)and friendship; a story about individuals within 'the system.' Or as a fun piece of chuckle-inducing (usually from Billy Bob's great guy that gets left hypochondriac)action piece. Although Bruce Willis looks a little bored and lacklustre, the film has an cute (kind of a twist) ending.

Naturally Terry is freaking out.`One last big heist! What a great idea! Joe knows best. And what does Joe get me? Stuck in a bank called the Alamo surrounded by the entire Los Angeles police force.'How did America's most famous bank robbers get in this mess? Reporting from the scene, tabloid TV host Darren Head (Bobby Slayton) tells viewers the pair visited his home a few nights ago and forced him at gunpoint to film their version of events.`The result is part soap opera, part crime drama,' he intones, Geraldo-like, ` it's part 'Bonnie and Clyde', it's part Barnum and Bailey.'Uh oh, I feel a flashback coming on. Sure enough, the movie spools back to the duo's daring escape from an Oregon prison and a subsequent string of bank robberies with Joe's cousin, Harvey (Troy Garity), a wannabe stunt man, acting as getaway driver. Nervous, timid, a hopeless hypochondriac, Terry tends to fret over small details (`I ask him to get me a good mustache and he gets me something that looks as if it came out of a Cracker Jack box.') Joe, on the other hand, is cucumber cool, whether sweet-talking a lady or stealing her car. Of course, he can be a tad impulsive. Take the way he improvises a bank robbery on the spot, disarming the guard by sticking a Magic Marker in his back and pretending it is a gun. Now, Terry, he's cautious and methodical. It's his idea to kidnap a bank manager after work, spend the night with the family and open the safe in the morning.before business hours. (As for Harvey, well, he's not the brightest light on the string but, as Joe says, he's honest and he falls real good.)Everything goes smoothly (more or less) until unhappy housewife Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett) bumps into Terry while he is attempting to hijack her car. `I'm a desperate man,' he tells her, none too convincingly. `Desperate? You don't know the meaning of the word,' she sobs, zigzagging in and out of traffic like a demented Indy driver. `Desperate is waking up every morning and wishing you hadn't.'  `On second thought, why don't you just pull over and let me out,' he pleads. No such luck. Terry represents an opportunity to escape the emptiness of her life and she is not going to let him get away. Since she refuses to stop the car, the pair winds up at the motel hideout. For Joe it's lust at first sight. For Terry, well, he recognizes trouble when he sees it (`Kate is an iceberg waiting for the Titanic.') Too late. Kate becomes romantically entangled with both men and is unable to choose (`Together, you make up the perfect man.')Director Barry Levinson gives his actors plenty of room to move and they respond with some intriguing choices. Thornton is wonderfully twitchy while Willis handles his role with straight-faced panache. Picture Abbott and Costello playing Butch and Sundance. Blanchett's Kate is the perfect female match for these characters. After seeing her as a regal young monarch in `Elizabeth', a troubled welfare mom in `The Gift' and a deliriously funny refugee housewife in this film, I'm convinced there is nothing this chameleonic actress cannot do. As for Garity, he's a natural born talent. Harvey may be a little slow on the draw but it only adds to the character's naïve goofy charm. I like the way Garity savors his dialogue.  He talks like Willie Nelson sings, the line readings a little `behind the beat' and flavored with a hint of country twang.The script (by Harley Peyton) ripples with wry movie references. The video the two teens are watching in that first home Joe and Terry break into? It's 1963's The Great Escape (that's Steve McQueen on the motorbike.) During Kate's first night at the hideout, Joe gallantly stretches a curtain across the bed he is sharing with her. `Saw it in a movie,' he explains. The reference, of course, is to the famous scene in 1934's  It Happened One Night. Peyton also slips in sly nods to boomer music faves like Bonnie Tyler and a certain Canuck rock icon. `You really think you're going to fool anyone in that get up,' asks Cloe (Stacy Travis), the wife of kidnapped bank manager Darrill Miller (Brian O'Byrne). `I mean, you look like Neil Young in . what was that album . 'After the Horses'?. ` `It was 'After the Gold Rush',' Terry says. ` And, besides, that's not the one. It's the one where he's leaning against a tree in the snow or whatever. That was actually what I was going for.'  (That would be 1969's `Everybody Knows This is Nowhere.') Some of the show biz satire may be a little obscure. For example, Joe likes to read Sun Tzu's The Art of War. This would seem to be a dig at fallen uberagent Mike Ovitz who reputedly used the ancient Chinese text on strategy as a guide to daily living during his Hollywood heyday. Peyton sketches his characters with a droll wit reminiscent of Elmore Leonard, not surprising when you consider that the screenwriter adapted Leonard's `Gold Coast' for a 1997 TV movie. (I looked it up in the IMDB database.)Although it begins to run out of steam in the last half-hour `Bandits' is still great fun for savvy film buffs with its appeal skewing towards an older boomer demographic.

I say little on account of the fact it never aspires to being anything other than what it is, a non-larger than life tale of a bandit, his reluctant co-conspirator, a manic depressive housewife and a wannabe stuntman. By far and away Bruce Willis' best role since DIE HARD. He is the eminently likeable Joe Blake, innovative but small time bank job specialist who breaks out of jail by seizing a rare window of opportunity and dragging along, more by luck than judgment, passive and ultimately quirky Terry Collins. Billy Bob, who with his chameleon capabilities never looks the same in successive movies, is equally lovable as Collins, a simple man with a simple plan - to just be happy! Subtle yet hysterically funny in execution, Ms Blanchett is inexorably drawn into the lives of the two convicts after her character, bored housewife Kate Wheeler, flattens Collins with her car.Five star outing from Cate Blanchett here who so totally balances the lives of the other two men in her 'borrowed' life. Disparate and at opposite ends of the spectrum, she loves them both and tells them at once stage Together you make the perfect man!  So true! Caper follows caper until she must chose between them, which of course she cannot.Thornton takes quirky to a new level here (how this can be the same man who played Karl Childers in SLING BLADE is a poser of some magnitude) So many delightful touches to the film you simply have to watch it multiple times to catch them all. I will not give away anything in terms of the concluding plot-line but if ever there was a feel good film - then this is it! Even at 2 hours plus, one finds themselves wishing it didn't end!All the leads are simply brilliant, I could not insult the others by nominating a preference.

I am pleased to report that Bruce Willis actually holds his own against Ms. Blanchett, and Billy Bob Thornton does the best work I have ever seen him do.  His character is the most appealing bundle of neuroses and hypochondriacal fetishes you will see on screen this decade, and yet he is utterly, convincingly real.  Cate Blanchett's Kate-the-not-quite-hostage is an over-the-top character, but that is neither quibble nor criticism  Ms. Blanchett was born to play over-the-top women in ways that make the surreal seem the most intensely real thing the viewer has ever experienced.  Here, she succeeds, and succeeds with grace, style, and, as I have said before, compellingly visceral presence. This is a very good, very funny, loving portrayal of one of the more criminal (but, revealingly, least violent) frayed edges of our social fabric.

Influences from the Cohn brothers emerge that are unmistakable, although a bit more subtle.  It's finally encouraging to see a film without gratuitous sex scenes that rely on dialogue and humor to make it a totally pleasurable experience.

After a spontaneous escape from the Oregon State Penitentiary, Joe and Terry (Willis and Thornton) need cash, so they make like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde-- make that `Clyde' and Clyde-- and proceed to do what they do best  rob banks.  They have a long-range goal in mind, but not much in the way of day-to-day planning, so they just kind of wing it as they go.  And though they want the money, they really don't want to inflict any serious bodily harm on anyone, so they come up with a way to circumvent any untoward opposition; to wit, they simply go to the bank manager's house, spend the night with him and get on with the robbing first thing in the morning.  Soon dubbed the `Sleep Over Bandits,' they are well on their way to effecting their goal when they run into the proverbial unforeseeable element, and her name is Kate (Blanchett), a woman in a state of flux who becomes their hostage-- or is it the other way around?  It's the question that Joe and Terry are going to have to answer if they want to get on with things; but as always happens-- especially in the movies-- when a woman becomes involved, it's just not that easy to figure out.  In fact, as Joe and Terry discover, it's down right complicated.  And it's just the hook the audience needs to really get involved, and for everyone concerned it becomes a wild and hectic ride into that cinematic sunset.	As he's proved in numerous films before, Levinson certainly knows how to tell a story, and he has a great cast of actors with which to do it in this one.  Most importantly, he knows what works, how to present the material most effectively and how to get the best out of his stars.  And he keeps it all moving without a hitch; the two hours you spend with this bunch veritably flies by and leaves you wanting more, which in itself says a lot about the entertainment value of this film.  Make no mistake, this is definitely a romanticized take on some `bad' guys, but suspend disbelief at the door and go with the flow; these are characters you're going to like-- even care about-- and they're going to give you an exciting time out from the rest of your life.  Not a bad deal, especially when it's done this well.	In Joe, Willis creates a character that can only be described as a `good' bad guy, more like Robin Hood than Dillinger.  He brings a tough, determined edge to the role, giving Joe a kind of focus and discipline that defines him, and he comes across as menacing without the menace.  Willis conveys the fact that Joe may not know everything, but he knows what he wants and is going to do all he can to get it.  It makes for a convincing portrayal of an average guy who has fallen into extraordinary circumstances, to which he reacts in a very real and credible manner.  Joe is believable, which makes the film easy to embrace and enhances the fun.  A good job by Willis, and though Joe is essentially a variation of Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski, the character Willis played in `The Whole Nine Yards,' this guy is all Joe, and that's what counts here.	As Terry, Billy Bob Thornton continues to demonstrate his versatility as an actor; can this possibly be the same guy who played the disturbed Karl in `Sling Blade,' or the nerdy and wanting Jacob in `A Simple Plan?'  The answer, of course, is yes, and it underscores what a talented character actor Thornton truly is.  As the phobia-prone, hypochondriac Terry, he infuses a dry, subtle humor into the film that works incredibly well opposite Willis, and it makes the characters different sides of the same coin.  It's a complex character that Thornton delivers with facility and care, and he succeeds in making Terry likable and memorable.	The real highlight of the film, however, is-- hands down-- Cate Blanchett, who plays the repressed, lonely and frustrated housewife, Kate, with a vitality that brings her brilliantly to life.  Blanchett lets her hair down and immerses herself in the role, and her very presence on the screen is absolutely vivacious.  The first time she appears on screen is a shot looking out at her from inside a refrigerator she is opening; a pale, blue light falls across the close-up of her face, and though is passes quickly it's one of those `moments' that instantly become indelibly etched in your mind's eye forever.  Because in that split second you realize that something special has just transpired-- that the movie has just been catapulted to the top rung of the ladder.  And because of Blanchett, Kate just as quickly becomes the central character in the film, and it's simply a terrific performance by one of the most gifted actors in the business.	The supporting cast includes Troy Garity, January Jones, Rocky LaRochelle, Jaye K. Danford, Anthony Burch and Bobby Slayton.  An engaging and thoroughly enjoyable film, `Bandits' is like a `best of all genres' movie, because it's a mixture of action, drama, comedy and suspense all rolled into one-- and it's done perfectly.  Levinson presents it in such a way that it draws you in from the beginning, and the performances are all as good as it gets-- the stars simply shine in this one.  It's the kind of movie you can watch time and again and never tire of seeing.  It has it all, including a great ending.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.

Flashbacks narrate as Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton are surrounded by police in a bank where hostages are taken. Upon escaping from prison they rob banks using a magic marker. They take bank managers hostage the night before and rob the bank the following morning. This has the media tagging them as the Sleepover Bandits. They meet Blanchett, a dysfunctional housewife who feels unappreciated by her workaholic husband and bratty children. She joins the bandits for excitement but media see her as a victim. This leads to a very violent climax. Director Barry Levinson plays off the humour effectively. His resume contains such titles as Rain Man and Wag the Dog. Willis and Thornton are well cast with Blanchett in fine comic flair. Blanchett will end up in a romantic triangle with both parties but it is the deception that eventually wins out that keep this film from greatness. Troy Garity plays a brainless stunt guy who acts as their getaway. The big downfall is the idiots they attempt to rob who play off the media.

I saw that it stars Bruce Willis and Cate Blanchett, and it made me curious. What kind of film might serve as the intersection of those two disparate careers? Now that I have watched the film, I am glad I did. I really enjoyed this crime comedy. And it all starts with Cate Blanchett. If I had to choose one word to describe her (as a person or as an actress) it would be mercurial. And her willingness to do the unexpected and to challenge herself comes through every role. Here, as Kate, the woman who (literally) accidentally becomes a part of a crime spree involving two escaped prisoners, she shines. And she is totally believable as the woman who is off-center, somewhat kooky, dangerously unpredictable and still deliciously desirable.Bruce Willis plays Joe Blake and Billy Bob Thornton plays Terry Collins. Joe is spontaneous and confident. Terry is a hypochondriac with OCD tendencies, who is always one twinge away from what he believes to be an exotic demise. Together, they are dubbed the sleepover bandits. They bicker like Butch and Sundance and similarly dream of a south-of-the-border paradise (filled with tuxedos and margaritas). Eventually, they become popular folk heroes, like Bonnie and Clyde. I think it's no accident that their sidekick/driver is named Harvey Pollard--an homage to Michael J. Pollard, who costarred in Bonnie & Clyde.The story allows the desperadoes to interact with their victims, who they treat as family friends. But the main thrust is the development of the triangle between Kate, Joe and Terry. There are some memorable lines and some wonderful moments. This comedy may be somewhat understated for some viewers, judging by some reviews, but it is not so understated as to bypass an opportunity for some incidental physical comedy.

Essentially, Joe decides to break out of prison at the spur of the moment and Terry mindlessly follows him out of the gates. Once outside they decide to rob banks which leads them to fame as the Sleepover Bandits due to their penchant of kidnapping bank presidents at night and sleeping at his house prior to robbing the bank the next morning. In one specific botched get-away Terry accidentally kidnaps a passing motorist named Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett) which further increases their fame. Rather than divulge the entire plot I'll just say that this film had some good moments and some bad moments. The beginning and the end were very good but it seemed to really slow down in the middle. Big time. And while both Bruce Willis and Troy Garity (as the get-away driver Harvey 'Dog' Pollard) added decent performances, Cate Blanchett didn't seem to have the right chemistry for this movie.

Although Willis is invariably himself the show is truly stolen by Billy Bob Thornton, whose quirky nervous character is revelatory offering apt space for him to present his comedic attributes.

How can you have hostages taken WITHOUT there being a situation? Don't we have enough redundancy in everyday life -- thunderstorm activity and free gifts -- without hostage situations? I tell you, it soured my whole outlook on the film even though I don't remember that the term itself was ever used.A good guess it that this looked like a fine comedy on paper to director Levinson, a former writer. And it does have a couple of funny lines and situations. Yet it somehow doesn't come together. The performers are all competent but the script requires them to do and say things that usually land with a slight thud.Three bandits, led by Willis and Thornton, rob banks the easy and non-violent way, just by staying overnight at the bank manager's house and accompanying him to the bank the next morning so he can open the safe and give them the money. A bored housewife, Cate Blanchett, is swept up into the crime spree and plays an active part in the robberies. Both Willis and Thornton sleep with her and find her irresistible.It's understandable. Blanchett, in addition to being a magnificent actress with a wide range (from Elizabeth to The Gift) and able to shed her Aussie accent instantly, has a long enough nose to set off her piquant beauty. It's not a traditional ski-slope nose either. Yes, it's long and it seems to extend down half her face but it has an alluring lump or two. Nobody has a face so unconventionally stunning. Her figure is merely stunning in a conventional way, so far as it's possible to tell, which is not far enough. She's like a tall, more symmetrical Vera Farmiga.Her two compañeros couldn't be more different. Willis, with hair, plays his usual role of robust man of action, a little dumb. He explains to a TV interviewer how his friendship with Thornton is like that of Lewis and Clark. Why else would Lewis have tracked Clark through the African jungle until he finally found him? Thornton is the hypochondriacal and indecisive passive figure, intolerant to all kinds of foods, allergic to this and that, worried about brain tumors, and phobic for Benjamin Disraeli's curly hair and even Charles Laughton.That kind of nonsense -- confusing Lewis and Clark with Stanley and Livingston, and being phobic for Disraeli's hair -- really IS funny as hell and it's precisely what the movie needed more of.As it stands, there are longish longueurs during which we watch the bored and glamorous housewife seduce the two bandits, who later must come to blows over who owns her. After a delirious and frenzied climactic bank robbery, everybody has a serious and completely unconvincing falling out, although who owns Blanchett is still an issue waiting resolution. She certainly doesn't go back to her husband. During her status as hostage, he makes a plea on TV for her to come back home if she possibly can escape. He won't be there. He's taking a vacation in Spain. But the house needs her. The house WANTS her. It's very moving.The photography and location shooting, mostly on California's northern coast, is colorful and evocative. Nice job there.

Thinks are going well at first until a big bump in the road appears. Kate Wheeler is running away from her miserable life, she runs into the Bandits, who make her a hostage, but both fall in love with her, and while she is having the time of her life on the run with these guys, she may also be the straw that breaks the camels back and ends Joe and Terry's friendship.From the first scene it is established that Kate was the one who tipped of the cops, and is the reason why the two are trapped in the bank. The Journey towards this particular moment however, is wild. The romantic element is funny, the crime element is funny, and the comedic element is especially funny. These Bandits turn out to be likable guys, We end up rooting for them, even though they may occasionally get childish and immature. Bruce Willis is not a funny guy, but here he plays almost a satire of himself. We are used to seeing him as a ruffian. Billy Bob Thornton is very funny, and because of his character's hypochodria, he gets to deliver some of the best lines in the movie. Bandits also offers what may Cate Blanchett's most adorable role. This must've been a fun movie to act in.There is a lot more worth saying about Bandits, but I don't wanna over sell it. You really have to see it for yourselves.

Like the character of Joe Blake's (Willis) cousin Harvey (Troy Garrity). Didn't he quit the bank robbery business at some point along the way as he tried to pick up his dream girl hitchhiker? But there he was in the thick of things at the finale. So did he quit just to fool the audience, with Joe and Terry (Thornton) in on the ruse? I didn't get that, and I'm not going back to try and figure it out.But I generally liked the chemistry between Willis and Billy Bob. I don't know if throwing Blanchett into the mix was all that valuable or necessary. The other two palookas could have managed their bank heist without her being around. The love triangle really didn't work for me, once again referring to those less plausible elements I referenced earlier.The twist ending following the opening set up was pretty clever though. Not really buying it, but it did manage to extend a bit of misdirection offered by 'Criminals At Large'. If I can get my hands on a better quality print of the flick than the one I watched, I just might be up for a second viewing. In the meantime, I'll come away reasonably satisfied with the first pass, but without a glowing recommendation. "},{"Title":"Well, yeah... Very entertaining... but","Date":"3 August 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" I could easily give Bandits a 10 if it were not because going over the top kills what was an interesting idea and doesn't do much for the threesome premise. I'm just saying that being the object of an excessive hypochondria can make the audience sick. So, at the end it did not work for me the notion that Kate would end up so heart split between the two male characters. The original idea of course was that Joe was all physical, attractive, suave and strong all in one. And Terry was oh so sensitive, smart, intelligent, vulnerable, soft and tender. OK, they were that way to a point and if if would've been that way you can swallow Kate assumption that the two of them can cake a perfect man... for her. So much so that she wasn't able to choose! Then, there is a couple of things to be said about this being wrong First, Joe demonstrated being very much a twin soul for her being gentle, romantic, sensitive, respectful and tolerant. And he was by no means a no brains male bimbo. Second, it's true that Terry demonstrates vulnerability more that anything else and probably she could fall for it. But it was so silly to have poor Terry being sick from about everything he would run into to the point that it went past the barrier of a suspended belief for a romance between the two. And if that wasn't enough, just take the scene at the bar where just because he had a numb leg the episode was taken to the extreme that the director would make Kate and him dance anyways so that she ended up holding a comatose guy going to the floor which he eventually did. All things said, should the script and the director had taken 2/3 or 3/4 of Terry hypochondria everything would have been fine Willis couldn't be better or more effective in his role; Cate Blanchett acting was perfect and she has a fantastic sex appeal; and Bob Billy did also very good, and his character's shortcomings weren't never his fault. I thought all the bank robberies, overnight dining and sleeping were absolutely charming, and several characters no matter how brief were really enjoyable. Too bad Terry had a phobia, an allergy or an imaginary illness almost every time he was on screen. Way too much...

I doubt it will stand out in the annals of cinematography, but it's a decent film.Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett are three unique people, thrown together by Willis and Thornton's bank robbing career. And even though it's not a flashy, exploding car movie, it is still really strong. First, the story is great, and every essential character is woven intricately into the plot. The movie basically develops through dialogue, so it may seem boring, but it all serves a purpose. The second strong point is the characters. Willis isn't the deepest guy, but his character has his own nuances that show in his behavior. Thornton is the real shining star here - he quite effectively pulls off an incredibly neurotic hypochondriac. The interaction of the characters is the main power behind the movie. I recommend this movie, not necessarily to Willis fans who expect big fiery flashes, but to the people who appreciate a movie with intelligence. There's probably more worthwhile story here than in every other Willis action film combined.

The film takes you through the lives of two similar, yet very different bank robbers. The bandits, Joe Blake(Willis) and Terry Collins(Thorton), have very opposite personalities but the same taste in women which clashes when they run into a depressed housewife named Kate(Blanchett). Kate finds their outlaw style of life thrilling and exciting. After falling for the Joe, the strong, handsome confident one; Blake and Collins decide to keep her on as an accomplice and carry out their plan of robbing various banks around the country and eventually high-tailing it off to Mexico with the cash and starting a nightclub. Everything is going according to plan, but unexpectedly shifts when Kate falls for the other bank robber, Terry. Terry is an unconfident, hypochondriac, nervous wreck who can't believe all this is happening to him. In life, when there are two guys fighting over a girl, the result is not usually pretty. Kate becomes confused and leaves the 2 alone with each other. Joe and Terry find that life with out Kate is more puzzling than before and decided they need her to carry out their last big job.The director Barry Levinson really knew this story and also knew how to tell it. The character development in this movie really made the whole thing. The characters are so distinctive and they needed actors who could portray those characteristics perfectly. The films casting was right on point. Billy Bob Thorton delivered an outstanding performance as Terry Collins. The on-screen chemistry between Thorton, Willis, and Blanchett is amazing. One thing that is refreshing about this movie is how their are no loose ends that need to be tied up because everything fits together perfectly. The cinematography plays a huge part in telling this story because it changes with every character and also runs with the film's music. The buried theme or conflict behind Bandits is 3 lost people who are just looking for happiness.

If I had been there alone, I would have left before this contrived yawnfest ended, in fact, since watching paint dry would have been more entertaining.This movie should be held up as evidence for the assertion that film-making is an art, not a simple formula.  In Bandits, we have Levinson + Willis + Thornton + Blanchett + potentially interesting plot idea, but it doesn't add up to anything worthwhile, in defiance of expectations.  Those are all great people, but they phoned it in this time, and with the script they had to work with, I hardly blame them.I didn't see these characters as anything but gimmicky, pretty unconvincing caricatures, and watching them bumbling through a stagnant plot was anything but entertaining.

The Sleepover Bandits, where they go to the bank president's house, take him and his family hostage, then go to the bank in the morning, rob it, and get away.  Then meet at a rendezvous point with their spotter, divide the money and go their separate ways for 2 weeks and do it all again.  The concept was different and original.  They're not your typical bank robbers.  Billy Bob Thornton as Terry Collins was a hypochondriac who's convinced he has a brain tumor and almost every disease there is.  He's also the brains of the group.  Bruce Willis as Joe Blake, was different.  One minute he can be a ruthless thug, beating someone up if he wants his car and he resists. Then he could take on the role of a protective father to Cheri (Azura Skye), when he sees her with her pants down and making out with her boyfriend or can be as polite as can be when he carjacks a woman or robbing a bank, always saying please and thank you.  Or he's playing councilor to a woman who comes to Bank President Darril Miller's (Brian O'Bryne) house to confront him and his wife about their affair.  The latter was deleted from the movie and can be found on the DVD.  That was a shame because it would've been great in the movie and Kiersten Warren (as someone identified her on the message board) was hilarious.Cate Blanchett as Kate Wheeler was good, but sometimes I found her to be a bit over the top.  Her chemistry with Willis and Thornton was good, but I thought they could've either developed her character a little more and/or toned her down a bit.Troy Garity as Harvey Dog Pollard was a goofball and I liked it.  The dance scene he did with January Jones (Claire) reminded me of the scene with Sylvester (Dick Shawn) from It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  I laugh when I see that scene.  All you needed next is the phone to ring and Ethel Merman on the line needing her son's help.The ending was great as well.  It didn't end the way I thought it would.

This is normally dramatic actors and a grossly over rated director trying comedy and finding they don't have that particular gift. You end up with a complete embarrassment that's sort of like watching a comic bomb on the old Johnny Carson show. I love, love Cate Blanchett, but she's bad. I think Billy Bob is the best, but he is terrible! and Bruce Willis, well you know how that looks when things don't mesh...Its just awful, and painful to watch if you are so able.

What I got was a revelation.  All of this is down to the strong case, solid direction and a very good script.This film established Billy Bob Thornton as one of the best comedic talents around.  Two moments in particular stand out.  The first is a completely spontaneous moment of comedic genius.  In the scene we see Thornton asleep, then he wakes and says something that had me laughing for ten minutes. The second scene is towards the end of the film when Thornton and Blanchett are dancing and gradually Thornton loses more and more of his right side to the point that he is partially disabled (although this is all imagined).Some critics have said, for example Roger Ebert, that the film does not know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama.  The sense of melancholy in the film however centres mainly around Blanchett, and this was not as big a part of the film as some have made out.While he is not at the same level as Thornton, Willis still gives a solid performance.  This is a reasonably nuanced comedic performance from Willis, notice the scene where they rob a bank and Willis checks out one of the hostages.The chemistry between Blanchett, Willis and Thornton is very good.  The scene where Blanchett gives Thornton a full makeover was one of the best scenes in the film.Overall, I would have to say that this is one of the best comedies of the last ten years, with Thornton giving a performance that ranks up there with Nicholson in 'As Good As It Gets' for the best comedic performance of the last ten years.

There is no believability with the plot, which would be fine if Levinson was not trying to make the viewer believe that the plot was credible. Thorton is annoying, while Willis and Blanchette try to make the best of a weak and stupid script. A loser, both as a movie, and a director.

We were quite puzzled by the film; we thought it terrible, but didn't really know why since we had been so blotto through most of it. I recently saw BANDITS on DVD, and I must say, it's much better than I remembered (a statement that might be considered questionable as I didn't remember much of it at all).Cate Blanchett once again amazes in a role that could have been flat and one-dimensional or just plain cute in the hands of most actresses. Cate is the best actress in motion pictures right now; she is the primarily reason for seeing BANDITS.Billy Bob Thornton is quite good in his role, though his hypochondriac shtick wears a little thin towards the end of the picture. Bruce Willis turns in a solid Bruce Willis characterization, charm and slightly absurd, always not-quite self-conscious machismo. The only negative in the acting category is Troy Garity, who is as awful as I remembered him, in the role of fifth wheel. It was no surprise, watching the interesting extras contained on the DVD, to find out that he is Jane Fonda's son and was cast in the movie as his godmother is one of the producers! Garity is handsome, a sort-of unrefined John F. Kennedy, Jr., but his voice is terrible and he's not much of an actor. As we can see from the bottoming out of Bridget Fonda's career, unlike the Redgraves, the Fonda acting genes have become quite diluted unto the third generation. Garity's performance is an indictment against Hollywood nepotism.All in all, an entertaining diversion that would be a good rent for those times when better MUST-SEE flicks aren't in stock at the video store. The  film is well-crafted and beautifully shot, with great  locations in Oregon and northern California. I give the film a 6 out of 10 (and you may rate in higher) and Cate Blanchett a 10 out of 10.

The introduction of Cate Blanchett's character half an hour into the film (one of its faults &#150; should have been much earlier), provides one of the funniest scenes in recent memory with Blanchett belting out Bonnie Tyler's 'I Need a Hero' while indulging in her passion &#150; cooking.

With great performances from Blanchett (as always) playing an unloved married woman and Thornton as the neurotic Woody Allen type bank robber, the film hits some high notes. An average turn by Bruce Willis as the dominant male of the three brings it back down most of the time. Coupled with a sometimes great screenplay, Bandits is a good 2 hours of escapist fun.

We are escorted into this chaos in flashback by the raspy-voiced host of an America's-Most-Wanted-type show called Criminals-at-Large in quasi-documentary fashion.A revelation neurotic, paranoid, but brilliantly clever Terry is played magnificently by Billy Bob Thornton, showing range and a sense of humor I never knew he possessed.  Picture a southern-fried Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen's character in TTMAR) embodied in Thornton.  Bruce Willis is ideally cast as Joe, the beastly suave and erratically tempered natural leader of the cellblock.  Creator Barry Levinson and Willis has fun paying homage not only to Butch Cassidy, but in slyly combining elements of other vintage Paul Newman movies/characters, including (I believe) Cool Hand Luke, The Sting, Where The Money Is, Hombre, Harper, Hud, Lady L, and Sometimes A Great Notion.  Cate Blanchett, who showed similarly indelible wildness in The Shipping News, scores big-time as a modern-day Etta Place mixed with the Susan-wannabe in Desperately Seeking Susan and a dash of Estelle Parsons from Bonnie and Clyde.  The chemistry and repartee between the trio are unforgettable.  Other characters pay homage to Bonnie and Clyde, Take The Money and Run, Pocket Money, and others.This movie is a lot of fun.  Enjoy it.

The first few scenes were terrific - especially the back-and-forth between Willis, Thornton, and their 'victims'. And then, enter the female.Not only was Ms. Blanchett's acting horrible, her part was clumsy and poorly written. 'Bandits' fails outright as a romance. Had I seen a ninety minute movie with no romantic subplot - just the story of Willis and Thornton, bank robbers - I would've had no complaints, and probably enjoyed the movie much more.Until the end of the film, I was going to complain about the flashback nature of the plot - I thought too much was revealed at the beginning, but after the ending, I was satisfied.All in all, not a bad film, one of Willis' stronger efforts.

In the whole spate of 'heist' films that have emerged over the last couple of years, this stands out with the best of them - better than the over-hyped The Score, for example. In fact the only film which measured up to this is the remake of Ocean's Eleven, which is a similar format in that you can't help rooting for the 'bad' guys.I was astonished to see reviews describing it as boring as it is not, not for an instant. Sure it does not have spaceship chases like Attack of the Clones but that film had huge turgid 'romance' scenes which were far slower than anything in this movie. I guess if you think all Woody Allen films, including Bananas and Play it Again Sam are boring then you might think the same about this. As one might expect in a Barry Levinson film, the dialogue and pacing are crisp and witty, and the way the two main characters bounce off each other is often very funny but never silly. Cate Blanchet, who appears quite late in the film, is breathtaking as a sort of femme fatale who doesn't seem to ever realize what her effect on others is. This is not a star vehicle, it's an ensemble film, although Thornton stands out with a role far removed from his 'typical' performances such as in Monsters ball or Sling Blade. I'd rate this in my top 3 for the year so far.

It involves the exploits of two bank robbers, Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thorton) who are known as The Sleepover Bandits. The night before a planned holdup they go to the home of the bank manager and hold him and his family until the next morning, whereupon they all proceed to the bank and rob it. They also steal a lot of cars one of which belongs to unhappy housewife Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett) who goes along for the ride. Naturally a love triangle ensues as the trio continues their crime spree. This movie is essentially a three character study involving the interplay between the three stars. Thorton is the nerdy brains behind the group, Willis the macho womanizing member and Blanchett the monkey wrench that gums up the works when comes between them. There are excellent performances from all three principals, particularly Thorton. The ending is a little hard to believe but is nevertheless entertaining. The fact that they are never caught with any of their many stolen vehicles is also a little baffling. That aside, I think that you will find Bandits a delightful way to pass a couple of hours.

To have fun, be entertained, and not get dissapointed. So people who vote for 1-4 points probably had more attention for other stuff than for the movie I guess..... Cate Blanchet proves that by now she can play anything drama, comedy, action, horror, she is one of those few stars on the screen who will do well anywhere you place her. Bruce Willis has one negative point for me...that eternal little smile on his face which doesn't make him look serious, even when he would kill someone..... The movie is strong most of the times, only when the two have the interview with the reporter, the film arrives at a very weak point. Suddenly text and acting seem to be less important but luckely it is a little part of the film. Overall this would be a movie I would recommend to ANYONE who would ask if it's a good movie to watch.

The script is clever with an incongruous love triangle between escaped convicts and bank robbers Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) and Joe (Bruce Willis), and their captive turned accomplice Kate (Cate Blancett).This is not a film to be taken seriously and the bank robberies are more slapstick than dramatic.  Terry and Joe kidnap bank managers the night before, have a nice dinner with the family and then go to work with them the next morning to rob their bank, earning them the nickname `Sleepover Bandits'.  Before long, they are so famous that the bank managers treat them like honored guests.Director Barry Levinson's (Good Morning Vietnam, Rain Man, Wag the Dog, Sphere) forte is presenting human stories, though he doesn't have much of this type of zany comedy on his resume.  He is excellent at character development and presenting the finer points of relationships and that is evident here, though the characters are all wacky.  Many of the bits are funny in a peculiar way, but a good number are just goofy and miss the mark.  The best comedy comes from Billy Bob Thornton, who makes Terry into a hyper neurotic, paranoid hypochondriac.  Just about everything that comes out of his mouth is comical, and he delivers it with such an ironic sense of seriousness that it doubles the effect.  Anyone who has ever had a friend who was into self help books will find Thronton's performance to be a scream.  Willis again plays the macho straight man with his usual ease.  This is a character that he can play sleepwalking; he has played him so many times.  Willis seems far more tongue-in-cheek than Thronton, and it is hard to tell whether he is incredulous as the character or of the character.Cate Blanchett rounds out the cast with another loony character, a lonely housewife looking for excitement and fulfillment.  Blanchett has such outstanding range that almost any project she attempts produces terrific results.  To make Kate believable, she has to conjure a character that can be attracted to two men who are utter opposites, yet somehow she pulls it off.This is a strange story full of peculiar people and it is great fun if you aren't hoping for anything approaching reality.  I rated it 7/10.  It is good light fare for viewers with a twisted sense of humor.

Joe (Willis) is a super-cool womanising Taoist-reading tough guy whereas Terry (Thornton) is the hypochondriac neurotic who has every phobia under the sun. They both somehow manage to escape from prison, and eventually rob a bank to get easy money. Terry unwillingly tags along as Joe decides he's heading to Mexico to establish a business. Eventually, Terry masterminds a plan to rob more banks to fund their ideal business, by hijacking the bank manager's family the night before the intended robbery. As the duo successfully begins a series of thefts, they soon become known as the infamous sleepover bandits and are wanted by both the Police and media nationally. During their travels, they unwittingly meet Kate (Cate Blanchett), a frustrated housewife who is more volatile under pressure than the pair themselves. She joins them to seek adventure in her ordinary life, as the media think she is their hostage. Soon enough Joe becomes infatuated with Kate, and the eventual romance ensues, except the only problem is Terry also falls for her.'Bandits' is a very funny film, but it's narrative starts with its climax and is told from a past perspective. In some films this works, but in 'Bandits' the pacing seems uneven and story is predictable. It won't take long to figure out the essential ingredients for the ending, and the main problem is the length it takes to get there. What distracts you however, is the interaction between Joe and Terry as they commit their crimes. Billy Bob Thornton is exceptionally hilarious as Terry, whose performance brings the most laughs, and Willis is his usual cool manner as the calm anti-hero in Joe. Cate Blanchett also adds to the mix, making the interaction between the love-triangle fairly humorous. The problem isn't in the acting, but in the characters themselves and their believability. 'Bandits' wants to be a black comedy with realistic characters, but the script doesn't allow it. Instead we get animated characterisations whose actions lack any real sense, and motives lack any real history- but they supply enough laughs for the duration of film. The storyline itself lacks severely in developing sincere emotion as the relationship between the three develop further, and it somewhat gets nauseating as you're ultimately waiting for the film to reach its established climax.Besides the acting, which was fairly good, the other technical aspects of 'Bandits' were extremely poor. The cinematography was too dark, and often badly constructed in a few scenes, which detracted from the performances slightly. Characters were difficult to see because of shadows in some shots, and some angles were completely obscuring the framing of them. Other photography aspects were great with some notably nice shots, during some of the romance and actions scenes. The editing in the film either added well to the pacing, or was completely jumpy. Some shots didn't match entirely and was especially noticeable during one action sequence where the two shots didn't correlate with each other as far as movement. Barry Levinson hasn't impressed of late, and he seems to have clumsily directed this film, leaving his three main stars to ad lib to a witty dialogue-driven script. The humour is derivative from a mixture of several previous comedies and independent crime films with dark humour. Billy Bob Thornton's Terry seemed to be the Southern version of Woody Allen's film personas with several nervous mannerisms and quirky behaviours intertwined into one unbelievable character in 'Bandits'. Terry's character was so over-the-top, to the extent that some of the comedy seems too forced and absurd, and it didn't sustain its running time. 'Bandits' shines in certain scenes of hilarity due to performances and its light-hearted feel, but overall the film is badly constructed and dull in parts. Bandits simply becomes a slightly above average comical-action movie that is entertaining yet equally forgettable as well.*** out of *****!

It's about a pair of likeable bank robbers named Joe and Terry (Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton), who escape from jail and go on a well-executed bank robbing spree and become famous as the `sleepover bandits' for their pattern of staying over the bank manager's house the night before and cleaning out the bank as he lets them in first thing in the morning. They are saving to retire and open a South-of-the-Border nightclub when they meet a beautiful lady named Kate (Cate Blanchett of `The Gift'), who they both fall in love with and vice-versa, which then complicates their friendship and trust.  The robbers decide to tell their own story to Darren Head (Bobby Slayton), an America's Most Wanted-style TV show host at gunpoint in his home, where they become the subject of media frenzy, as they are the most friendly and likeable heist duo since `Bonnie and Clyde' or `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'. They never kill anyone and always seem to get away just in time, with the help of their willing hostage (Blanchett) and trusty driver Harvey (Troy Garity of `Bohemia') Although fairly predictable (with the exception of the ending), this movie keeps your attention through the full two hours with the help of an especially solid performance by Billy Bob Thornton. Like his dim, yet funny role in `The Simple Plan', he this time plays an idiot savant hypochondriac who is always worried about some kind of fate, like a brain tumor or a heart attack. Bruce Willis is no slouch in this movie either. He does his part by playing the charming yet dangerous role that he does best. If you're just feeling like you need a good laugh right now, this is probably for you. It is lighthearted, yet fast-paced enough to hold the viewer's interest.

Many recent movies fail partly because they don't know how to end them. Bandits has a very clever and entertaining ending, and that's one reason it is so good. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton play Joe and Terry, opposite personalities but good friends in prison. After they break out by taking and driving a cement truck through the fence, Joe (Willis) muses that it would be nice to buy the old hotel in Acapulco, build a bar, and serve the patrons margaritas. Terry (Thornton) say, That takes money, where are we going to get money like that? Rob banks, we'll just walk in and take the money, reasoning that government insurance will cover it, and no individual person will lose anything.The film starts near the end, their last stand in the Alamo Savings and Loan lobby, patrons and workers inside, dozens of cops outside, helicopters overhead, Terry saying, Just one last, big heist, you said, now how are we going to get out of this? Then, a newsman is reporting later, Shortly before the bloody shoot-out that took their lives. So all through the 2-hour movie we know the story is leading to this. Joe and Terry couldn't be more different, Joe a happy-go-lucky, spur-of-the-moment type of guy that always gets the girl. Terry is a nervous hypochondriac, intellectual, likes to plan everything, and who always loses the girl.The filmmakers call Bandits a romantic comedy, and it is. Kate (Cate Blanchett) is a neglected housewife who accidentally becomes part of the gang. First she is attracted to Joe, then after a heist spends a week with Terry and gets attracted to him. Part of the story is the competition for Kate, who finds this lifestyle infinitely more exciting than her marriage. The writing is very good, the actors equal to the task, and there are many laugh out loud moments in the film. It is rated PG-13, with essentially no foul language nor overt sex, and no one gets killed, all of which is refreshing for this kind of movie. I hope others learn from their good example.The last scene reveals the misdirection set up when the film starts. Joe and Terry's getaway driver (Jane Fonda's real life son) has some ability with stunts and, it appears that Joe and Terry shoot and kill each other in that final bank robbery. In the confusion two paramedics come in, put them into body bags, and rush off, the ambulance crashes, the driver is on fire, the ambulance explodes and burns, completely incinerating the bodies. Apparently. However the two medics were the driver and girlfriend, the shootings in the bank were faked, the crash staged, and everyone gets away with the money to Mexico.The film is based loosely on real people and some real events, however is so entertaining for the interplay among the 4 main characters, and Bruce and Billy Bob are the best. Some have compared it to Bonnie and Clyde, but to me it is more similar to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, with the humor and the gentle approach of the bandits. Blanchett is OK, but her fake American accent sounds manufactured much of the time. I can think of a number of actresses who could have been better selections. Fonda's son is really good, and perfect for his role.The DVD has one of the better making of specials. It tells the story of how this project came together, how Willis first got the role of Terry, but when Val Kilmer had to bow out, Thornton was brought in to play Terry, and Willis became Joe, all of which seems to fit better. A very interesting extra is the making of scene 71, where Joe and Kate share a bed, separated by a blanket they hung from the ceiling. Much of what ended up in the scene was improvised after the curtain accidentally fell down. All this is covered in the feature, then when it is over, you can go directly to that scene to see the completed scene again. That's a feature on a DVD that I have never come across before, and I hope others borrow this idea.Overall a very good movie and, judging by the small number of IMDb votes, one that has not been seen by many people.

Bruce Willis is entirely convincing as a Mr Action who's not into reflective thought (in fact at times positively deficient in the brains department) and Billy Bob Thornton makes a good brainier, but less assertive (not to say neurotic) companion in crime. Who ever heard of someone with an antique furniture phobia? Billy Bob is an actor with an interesting range; he can be as stupid or as smart as the script requires, and he manages to convince us that Cate Blanchett, the bored housewife who joins the gang for the thrills, would be unable to choose between him and Bruce the Hunk.Otherwise we scream up and down the West Coast, robbing banks (all Federally insured of course) by the simple expedient of capturing the manager the night before. This involves sleeping over at the managers' houses, leading to some really surreal conversations around the breakfast table. It's really quite amusing how many bank managers actually don't seem to mind being robbed.In reality, bank robbery is a fairly nasty business, especially for those bank employees who suffer  a series of them. But Bruce, Billy Bob and Cate (with a fine American accent) are safely wrapped up here in a pleasant fantasy with no particular message (except maybe that everyone hates banks).

Mr.Thorton takes quirky to new levels with the character, Terry Collins, an obsessive-compulsive hypochondriac who entertains with obscure imagined health problems and maladies, and a comical running speach pattern replete with facial tics and humorous herky-jerky machinations, while being up-front and candid, somehow making abstract sense of his life as a criminal on the run.  Plus, he's a pretty good cook.  Mr.Willis's character, Joe Blake,is under-played nicely, especially in the movie's first half, with insidious undercurrents of an unpredictable twisted heavy.  Kate Blanchett's manic and unhappy character, Kate Wheeler, fits right into this cabaret of sleep-over bank robbers.  Directed by, Barry Levinson,Bandits entertains with slick direction and snappy blues musical score, but plods somewhat in the second half, losing it's rough-hewn edgyness, finally softening and backing away from the dark side explored in the movie's beginning.  Somewhat akin to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Bonnie and Clyde, Bandits makes for enjoyable viewing, as it's not necessarily the destination, but how you get there that counts.

Willis and Thornton play Joe and Terry who escape from prison and begin a spree of bank robberies. They become the `sleep over bank robbers', named because they go the bank manager's house the night before the robbery, stay with the manager and his family and then head off to the bank the next morning to knock over the bank, manager in tow.                Along the way they encounter bored house wife Kate (Blanchett) who joins with the lads looking for excitement. She gets it, in loads, having relationships with both the boys as well as helping out with the heists.                The mood stays pretty jocular, Bandits is far from a serious caper film or even a romance of meaning. It is spiced with Blanchett's high energy acting style, Thornton's quirky joviality and Willis's solid urbanity. There's a crackerjack prison break using a cement truck, a great car crash later on and a very nice romantic scene or two, especially one on a beach. Blanchett sings badly. It's funny.                So there are plenty of fine elements, not the least of which is Billy Bob Thornton as a rampant hypochondriac. Still Bandits loses its focus somehow through its middle third, not knowing how to move from snappy romantic heist movie through the boy loses girl bit into its rather contrived finish. Pace might have been the problem.                Director Barry Levinson (Sleepers, Disclosure, Sphere, Wag The Dog, Rain Man, Good Morning Vietnam) has directed an uneven swag of films. Bandits will sit somewhere in the middle of the (much larger) bunch.

Unfortunately it lacks the freshness of say `Dog Day Afternoon' and the subtle character development of `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'.  Nevertheless, Willis and Thornton provide interesting characters and Blanchett is adequate (in reality it is a role that many competent actresses could have pulled off without much problem) and she provides one of the cool asides in the film by singing a couple Jim Steinman (songwriter for Meatloaf) songs.  I personally love Steinman's over the top tunes, so I really enjoyed those parts.SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER!!!! The ending is sub par because in trying to be crafty the filmmakers demonstrate how careless they are.  I can usually overlook technical details and suspend disbelief, but this was too much.

Rubbing the salt of pointless homage into the wound of unoriginality, it even borrowed from Cameron Diaz' karaoke scene in My Best Friend's Wedding, except played for pathos rather than laughs, which didn't work.

Bruce Willis was... well, the same old Bruce Willis really. The man can't act, could never act, probably will never act. He just stands around looking... solid. Cate Blanchett can act (and how!) when she wants to, but her mind was clearly on other things here (Lord Of The Rings, perhaps?) Billy Bob Thornton tried to make the most of poor material, but his hypersuggestive hypochondriac was no more sympathetic than Willis' Tao-devouring tough guy or Blanchett's not-actually-manic-depressive housewife trapped in a pointless marriage to a rich but workaholic businessman (which a younger Goldie Hawn could have made so much more of, and probably has).It smacks of heavy-handed self-mocking that lines from the film included (roughly) expect the unexpected and just how long can these two continue to evade the police?.

Joe has anger management issues while Terry is a serious hypochondriac. Along the way they pick up Joe's cousin Harvey (Troy Garity), a stuntman-in-training who becomes the getaway man. Terry, the self-proclaimed brain, works out a plan to kidnap bank managers to get access to bank vaults. The plan seems to work until a distraught-and possibly chemically imbalanced-housewife (Cate Blanchett) hits Terry with her Mercedes. Next thing you know, Kate (the character's name, I promise) is along for the ride (yes, that is a double entendre). (By the way, if you were wondering if this review could be anymore parenthetical, you were right.)Bandits is a film where you cheer for the bad guys. Not because they're particularly attractive people, but because their eccentricities make them so real (and also because you aren't given any real reason to care about the good guys).  The situations presented here are pretty improbable, but the clever dialogue and snappy performances make up for whatever you might disbelieve.  I am converted; I was not a Billy Bob Thornton fan before now, but he is a brilliant comic actor here, and steals the show.  Bruce Willis isn't too shabby, either.  Their friendship is the core of the piece they are two completely different men who both gel and clash.  Cate Blanchett can do wrong as far as I'm concerned-check out the perfect American accent she wields here-she uses flawless comic timing to demonstrate raw vulnerability and loneliness.Harley Peyton's script is tight and, for the most part, lean.  There are a few scenes that the story could do without, but everything works for pure entertainment value, so as a viewer, I didn't mind.

Not wanting to hurt anyone but wanting to retire in paradise, the two men decide the best way to rob a bank is to do so as quietly as possible. They go to the bank manager's house the night before, spend the night, and then go with the manager to the bank the next morning, getting the goods while (usually) missing the bank traffic. For this, they are soon known throughout the country as the mild-mannered, crazily costumed Sleepover Bandits.Naturally, things don't go smoothly for long. In fact, the movie sets you up for a bitter ending -- we first hear about Terry and Joe in a TV show special, talking about how the two men died in a shootout at a bank. We know things go wrong, and we wait to find out how the misfortune begins.That misfortune takes the form of Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett), an unhappily married upper-class manic-depressive who, while crying her eyes out and listening to bad '80s music, hits Terry with her luxury car. She soon becomes the Sleepover Bandits' hostage, and even sooner, their love interest. Both men's love interest.Ah, a woman as man's downfall! How original! Lucky for director Levinson, it IS original, and he puts a fun spin on the normal Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid formula. All the actors do a wonderful job. Willis will hopefully soon figure out that he is a much better comedic actor than action figure, because most of us have known so since Moonlighting. Thornton is even better as the anal-retentive, obsessive-compulsive Terry, showing some wonderful timing and deadpan delivery. But Blanchett steals the show. She has never looked more beautiful, and, making a two-dimensional character into a rich, textured woman, she is even more stunning. Her performance is reason enough to see Bandits. But for some bizarre reason, when you aren't being completely entertained, you are incessantly checking your watch. Bandits is far too long (clocking in at over two hours), and, although the ending is definitely worth a wait, the middle is often muddling, sometimes downright dull. Levinson is a wonderful storyteller, but, somewhere along the line, someone messed up. The plot is too light, the story too thin, to take up the time allotted. It's like baking a cream puff out of pound cake ingredients. Too much weight for a very flaky dish.However, Bandits is not a total waste of money. The performances are stellar, and some of the jokes are hilarious. But be prepared to sit through some slow minutes. And be prepared to leave with a slight feeling of unfulfillment. Just like the burgled bank managers, the audience ends up feeling like they've been robbed in the sweetest of ways.

Also, I was in a very `low interest' state when I watching its too many cumbersome scenes. It stars Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. Willis just could not get the `balance' right as the macho bank robber who also has a soft heart. Blanchett's `transfer' of her english accent to a pitch perfect american one was pitch perfect;  she portrayed the lonely housewife on the run who gets caught up underneath the blanchetts (I mean `blankets') with both Willis and Thornton. However, what you have to `check' out from this film is the `unbelievable' performance of Billy Bob Thornton as the hypochondriac bandit. This is probably the best hypochondriac film character ever. Academy voters should `hype' themselves up and garner Billy Bob with a Best Actor nomination. Hey, if they do Billy Bob might even bring to the Oscars an `angelina' in disguise.

There are all sorts of boring reasons that I could list, but the one that you're probably most interested in (as you're reading this) involves movies. Summer is over, kids are back in school, and Hollywood starts bringing out &#145;riskier' films. The costume dramas, the Robin Williams dramatic pieces, the Mirimax Oscar Contender ® -- things like that. Now, while Bandits probably won't win any awards, it's a character piece that would have been overlooked in the summer. By character piece, I mean that it shifts genres. The previews look like a heist/caper movie with a romantic comedy subplot. Those previews aren't misleading. However, what they don't show is that the romantic comedy is more along the lines of Being John Malkovich than the collected works of Julia Roberts. More on that later. Bandits is about 2 bank robbers &#150; Joe (Willis) and Terry (Thornton). As is usual in heist movies, they want to go straight. Which takes money. Which means robbing banks. Joe is the muscle, Terry is the brains. Terry's plan daylight robberies. They kidnap the bank manager the night before the robbery, and spend the night with him/her, and then, before the bank opens, have the manager open the vault and give the &#145;all-clear'. Works like a charm. Terry's plans are great. Until Terry gets hit by a car driven by Kate (Blanchett). Terry, you see, is a hypochondriac, and thinks he received a concussion. Kate, on the other hand, is massively depressed. Not the most rational pair. Kate drives Terry back to the hideout, where she meets Joe and Harvey (Garity). Harvey is Joe's cousin, a wanna-be stuntman and their &#145;front man'. Terry knows that an outsider in the mix is a bad thing, Joe wants to sleep with Kate, Harvey is dense &#150; LET THE FIREWORKS BEGIN!Probably the best part about this movie is the actors. Billy Bob Thornton is an amazing character actor. Just look at Slingblade. Bruce Willis can play nearly any role you put in front of him, and play it well. Cate Blanchett is a name that isn't familiar to most moviegoers, but she's really, really good. (She was Queen Elizabeth in Elizabeth, a psychic in The Gift, and will either be praised or pilloried by geeks when she assumes the role of Galadriel in the upcoming The Lord of The Rings trilogy).Another big plus in this movie is the focus on character rather than plot. George Bernard Shaw (a playwright) once said that he hated plots. He just put characters into a situation and watched what happened. That's what we see in Bandits &#150; we don't get massive amounts of detail about the planing of the heists, we don't have a moral. It's not like it's a Martin Scorsese movie. What we have is a strange marriage/love triangle thing (ala Being John Malkovich or Chasing Amy) that works because we believe the actions that the characters are performing, and we believe the actors that are playing the characters. The principle characters are well written and well rounded. This review is shorter than previous ones, but, honestly, there isn't a whole lot of detail that can be written about.

It's a story of three strange characters on the road. The just happen to rob banks. Willis is wonderful. I'm starting to think I underestimated for years. He plays the character perfectly. Blanchatt proves one again that she is one of the best actresses of her generation, playing a part completely different from anything she has done before. But the star of the show is Billy Bob Thornton. What a tremendous actor this guy is. His best roles to date have been as simpletons (SLING BLADE and A SIMPLE PLAN). But here, he's the most intelligent person in the film. It fits him. His outrageous phobias are funny, but they fit him. BANDITS is just a lot of fun to watch.

When I was invited by my local newspaper to attend the Orange, CT premiere of the film with Director Barry Levinson in attendance, I was all the more excited. Barry Levinson has produced Rain Man, Wag The Dog, Good Morning Vietnam, and other great films. As a young student of great and/or classical films, I feel that the Rain Man is among the top 150 movies ever made...so I knew that Levinson wasn't going to make a bad movie, but would have a hard time matching that earlier work of his. THE BOTTOM LINE IS that Bandits turned out to be a terrific movie...drama-comedy-romance mixed together perfectly. Thornton is truly funny, Willis is the tough guy who draws laughs as well, and Blanchett is as gorgeous as ever. Trust me on this one- Bandits is a fun packed film worth every one of the 9 stars I give it...it's one everyone should see just for the joy of it...especially at the difficult time in history in which it was released, when a few laughs mean a lot to people.

Also felt similar rhythm as in Michael Lehmann's Hudson Hawk 1991 - the fun, adventuresome, paired romping plus a woman Bruce Willis with Danny Aiello plus Andie MacDowell. Here in Bandits, Bruce Willis is paired with Billy Bob Thornton plus Cate Blanchett. Both are light-hearted lavish comedy with romance and action, HH is more fairytale fantasy with three cool stars, lots of props, extras, and changing sets, while B is modern day road movie and bank robbery action fantasy with three unarguably charming stars. I rather enjoy Hudson Hawk more; perhaps it's the bonus Sinatra-style singing flair from Willis and Aiello sprinkled throughout the film.For a tightly scripted, well-presented substantial heist/bank robbery film, try director Don Siegel's Charley Varrick 1973, with superb performance from Walter Matthau in the lead. Michael Mann's Heat 1995, presents a more involved bank robbery plot (and lots of gunfire) with DeNiro, Kilmer and Sizemore opposite super detective Pacino. For the combination of thrills, romance and bank robbery of the younger set, try Kathryn Bigelow's Point Break 1991, with Patrick Swayze as the carefree surfer leader and Keanu Reeves as the undercover budding FBI agent who befriends him.Really look forward to the upcoming David Mamet's Heist, with Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito, Delroy Lindo and Rebecca Pidgeon, Ricky Jay and Sam Rockwell.

Quite amusing scenes arise out of this premise, particularly from Thornton. The addition of Cate Blanchett's character in the plot would probably ruin the movie had Barry Levinson not been directing it. Pretty soon, the plot itself becomes far less interesting than just laughing at the characters that he has created. Willis, Thornton, and Blanchett have some sort of non-chemistry between them, mostly you just get the feeling that they are acting without too much effort - but the parts they are playing are so weird you find you are having a good time anyway. Especially with Billy Bob's Terry. Terry is neurotic and psycho in the most freakish of ways, and Billy Bob plays him perfectly. He seems to derive so much enjoyment out of it you imagine he still to this day annoys Angelina by sitting around stuttering incoherently about his paranoias, just for kicks.

They start their career as bank robbers that very day.The film is a series of flashbacks, and cutouts, and interviews and 'how did they get there' scenes. The climax is touchy because one has to phrase special effects a certain way when people know they're watching . . . a movie, where everything's fake. And they didn't do it right, in this film.

The movie's essentially another addition to the long-winded genre of sympathetic villains.  For whatever reason, fictional bank robbers have always been touched with a velvet glove.  And if you just so happen to be `mobbed up', then you're well, `untouchable'.  While the outlaws featured here aren't connected, they do portray evil people we gratefully forgive.  And exoneration is so effortless with characters and situations that make you smile. I'm reminded of Bill Murray's less-than-stellar flick Quick Change.  While the majority of the film is pathetic, his planned bank robbery/escape at the beginning was ingenious.  Bandits relies on a time-released gimmick to bamboozle the audience, and unequivocally trumps Murray's climatic twist. Terry and Joe (Billy Bob Thornton and Bruce Willis) have just broken out of an Oregon State Penitentiary.  Why they were incarcerated to begin with isn't mentioned, but it becomes crystal clear ten minutes after their escape.  Without a plan of action, the duo fall back on habit and rob a bank, utilizing a magic marker as their weapon of choice.  Within a half-hour time, Terry and Joe regain a semblance of freedom, plus some much needed travel money. Levinson doesn't allow much time to get acquainted with the leads. Apparently Joe's a hothead who's in desperate need of anger-management. Terry's a basket-case hypochondriac who suffers from more phony illnesses than the American Medical Association has terms for.  Joe's the brawn, Terry's the brain.  Together they devise a foolproof scheme to successfully pilfer enough banks to fulfill their dream of running a nightclub 60 miles south of Acapulco.  Instead of knocking over a bank in daylight, they plan to kidnap the bank manager and his family the night before.  Then in the morning, before guards, tellers, and customers become witnesses, the outlaws can steal the cash without incident. While Joe and Terry rob the bank, their getaway driver Harvey (Troy Garity) impatiently waits.  This is a young inexperienced fool who'd rather concentrate on blondes walking across the street, or fantasize about his dream job as a Hollywood stunt man.  What he doesn't do particularly well, is pay attention to the risky job he participates in. Two stories diverge, when a lonely housewife named Kate (Cate Blanchett) accidentally hits Terry with her car.  Her husband would rather spend time at work, than with her, so Kate finds it exhilarating when she discovers true identity.  Terry, not one to talk, isn't keen on her sticking around, calling her `mentally imbalanced to a spectacular degree'.   Despite the bickering and negotiating, Kate convinces them and willingly becomes kidnapped, just as the `sleep over bandits' become an American phenomenon. Because the screenplay is long-winded, there are segments when it appears as the movie is stuck in neutral.  Truth be told, writer Harley Peyton (Twin Peaks) is intricately setting up a well thought out plot, worthy of substantial lag time.  Without the unfortunately slower scenes, the development of characters and situations would have been rendered impossible.  Plus the major difference with this action/comedy caper compared with other Hollywood flat-line fiction, is character development. Dialogue makes all the difference.  While some movies can abuse talk, Bandits allows enough speaking lines to fixate our imagination, but complements it with enough silence to allow us to recoup.  With such an emphasis on discourse, good acting is indispensable. While I want to express my continued amazement over Billy Bob Thornton, and his versatility that may only be matched with Dustin Hoffman or Jack Nicholson, even the scenes he steals, are stolen by cast mate Cate Blanchett.  Her supporting performance is Oscar worthy, though I doubt a movie like this will garner a second glance.  She's sweet, unsettling, diabolical, insane, and occasionally, all four simultaneously.  Willis left an awkward taste in my mouth.  His shift from mean-spirited bully to sweetheart and back is partly a fault of the writer, but largely is his deficiency in acting versatility. Director Barry Levinson doesn't make or break any of his films.  He isn't an artistic blockhead who involves deranged camera angles to provide a certain signature to his work.  Yet the man's track record is spottier than a Dalmatian.  For every Wag the Dog, he does a Sphere.  While not as socially significant as his Oscar winning masterpiece Rain Man, Bandits has moments of brilliance surrounded by relentless laughter.

This is by far the funniest film I've seen this year, with most of the humor relying upon asides from Billy Bob  Thornton's character. He's a case study in hypochondriacism, the more sensitive and realistic but less attractive half of a brother team of bank robbers. Action figure Bruce Willis portrays the older, tougher- but-still-charming, womanizing brother to a T... rounding out the crew is a would-be Hollywood stuntman (Troy Garrity) and, knowing Levinson, the fact that he's a stuntman isn't coincidental.Along comes a bored red-headed housewife -- Cate Blanchett -- who becomes the focal point of an anything-but-usual love triangle. A few words about Blanchett after Elizabeth and The Gift who knew she was a drop-dead knockout? I saw Willis on Letterman hawking the film and he made a Cate Blanchett -- woo hoo! remark and I said huh?. Because after seeing her with virtually no makeup (or rather, made up to look as if she was wearing no makeup) in several films I viewed her only as a gifted actress, another Aussie who could adapt various American accents apparently effortlessly. Bruce was right she's hot with a capital H.Via real-life comedian Bobby Slayton's John Walsh-like character -- he's the host of Criminals At Large, a reality TV show which chronicles the exploits of the duo, then trio as they happen -- the gang comes to be known as the Sleepover Bandits. They arrive at a bank manager's home the evening before each heist, spending the night then escorting them to each of their respective financial institutions the following  morning so that they may rob them pre-opening.The look of the film is pure Hollywood (hey, it's Levinson after all) but it does roll along at a merry pace, mixing progressively funnier pseudo-ailments from Thornton with equal doses of almost-tender romance and quick, well-done capers.Apart from the occasional Slayton recaps, this is an entirely linear flick, despite a comment made to open the movie.I give Bandits my highest recommendation for a film of this type.

Anyway, the result of showing the ending first is that it severely limits how the movie is supposed to progress.  I suppose the theory is the trip is the important thing, not the destination.The movie reads like a standard buddy road trip, love triangle, bank robber movie.  While there aren't really movies of that sort, if you put them all together you get a picture of what is going on in the movie.  Bruce Willis plays the typical tough guy (who even though he is a notorious bank robber he doesn't hurt people), Billy Bob plays his hypochondriac/psychosomatic partner.  Cate Blanchett plays Cate, a lonely housewife who runs away with the bad guys to put some excitement in her life.

That feeling of enjoyment is from a clever plot, and acting and directing that never lets the story become a farce.The writing, directing (Baltimore's Barry Levenson) and acting are all superb. I particularly appreciated Cate Blanchet's performance as Kate Wheeler, an unappreciated gorgeous wife in despair because she has prepared a fabulous gourmet dinner and then her dolt of a husband decides to skip dinner. (I recently saw a serious drama, The Man Who Cried, in which Cate Blanchett was also terrific. She hadn't come to my attention previously.) Billy Bob Thornton also was great as a neurotic convict/bank robber, and Bruce Willis uses a tough guy persona that has worked exceedingly well in such previous films as Pulp Fiction. The plot, derived from a true criminal case, is about a pair of convict buddies who break out of prison and begin robbing banks to finance their dream of a plush retirement in Mexico. But they don't like the dangers that ordinary bank robbers risk, so they come up with a novel approach of getting the bank managers to let them into rob the banks in the morning before the bank is open to customers. But when Cate Blanchett's character enters their life, a romantic conflict ensues. Troy Garity is very good as an easily distracted movie stunt man (I don't recall if he was a friend or relative) in need of some excitement who jumps at the opportunity to drive the bank robbers' get-away-car.The story is told as a narrative reflecting back on the events that led up to the narration's current time. The end has a surprise twist that I was able to guess because of something included earlier in the film.If you are old enough or fortunate enough to have seen Alex Guiness' 1950's era classic crime comedies, The Ladykillers and The Lavender Hill Mob, I think you will find that Bandits brings them to mind, despite Bandits being a less broad form of comedy.

It's been several years since anyone has seen anything from the famed child actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas, known as JTT in girly magazines, yet his influence in hat trends is still seen today throughout Hollywood. Why does Thornton wear this hat in this film? Actually, why in the hell does he always wear it?! He's been doing this for years, mostly in public appearances along with the likes of Rosie (surprise I'm gay!) O'Donnell, Samuel L. Jackson, Joe Pantoliano, and Tim Robbins! Why they wear these hats is a mystery to me, but more importantly why they wear them all of the damn time. It's ridiculous, and the simple fact that Thornton wears it in this film just pisses me off. Now that that's out of the way, let's move on.Bandits is based loosely, very, around the actual robbers who were aptly named the Sleepover Bandits, who would kidnap bank managers the night before their robberies and spend the night with them so they could take the money with ease the following morning without much fuss. Fairly clever, but it wasn't the creators' idea so they can't take the credit. So, throw in an impossible prison escape, a silly love story with a beautiful temptress, add some pyrotechnical friend that should have his eyes stabbed out for his utter stupidity and uncanny likeness to David Arquette&#133;.with a dash of what could have been a clever ending and you have Bandits. Don't forget the cheese&#133;.oh, and the hat.Thornton's acting is fairly decent, although Willis is surprising wooden here. The cast itself is fairly impressive, however the characters and story are just weak. While the overall cast is manageable, one character in particular is just retarded. Their getaway driver&#133;the David Arquette wannabe. His unquenchable thirst for ass is pathetic, corny, and takes entirely too much away from the main story. He mumbles and fumbles around like a wounded mongoloid who just huffed a can of ether. Coincidentally enough, the culprit is none other than Jane Fonda's crack-binge-conceived spawn.That's it, I'm tired of this....I'm beginning to convince myself that I have become jaded. Bandits is a below average caper with a silly love triangle that makes you feel cheated of your time with it's clichéd script. You can go through life with the consolation that you're not missing anything great or particularly good here. If you have any ether or spray paint lying around, it might be better to go find some bags and get your huff on than sit through this. On the bright side though, I didn't want to murder anyone after it's viewing, except for Mr. Crack Spawn Fonda, which is entirely justifiable. I can't say that for many movies that I don't enjoy.

And Billy Bob Thornton, who is also wearing a ridicoulus wig, overacts to the point where I wished the cops would shoot him. Hes not funny at all. Neither is Bruce. In fact none of the moments that are suppose to be funny are funny at all. Because theyve already been shown in the trailer. The only good things about the film are the beginning and the twist in the end. Clever done. But the fact that Kate choose both men and they both accept sharing her seems unrealistic and really stupid.

There are at least five of those loud arguments where nobody says anything important and its supposed to be funny.  I counted two times where two guys are in a fist fight over a woman and she gets in the middle and yells at them to stop.  There's the character that's a hypochondriac (ha ha).

It might even make a good educational tool for aspiring screenwriters.The thing that's really shocking though are the people involved.  Barry Levinson's one of my favorite directer (or at least he was before I saw BANDITS) and the guy who edited BANDITS has done all his films.

There are scenes that are totally stupid and inane. Maybe they have a special award somewhere for a film that best grates the nerves of the audience. Does it take a special talent to do this? The positive side is that Bob Dylan sings a couple of songs in the soundtrack, and it's a special pleasure to hear him. I don't know why he wanted his name associated with this piece of garbage, but here we have it. Someone said they spent $80 million making Bandits. I wonder how much Mr. Dylan got? Another positive is that there are some good location shots in Oregon, California and Nevada. However, there is no integration of the characters or plot into the surroundings. They may as well have blue screened it, and just paid that money to themselves.I saw it on television with commercial breaks. I know it's a bad movie when I'm looking forward to the commercials.The twist ending? It's been done so many times, it was an insult to once again throw it at us.

It is much more than a comedy--just the same way the Seventies Michael Caine/Noel Coward film The Italian Job left you wondering when that film finished open-ended.The clue of what is to follow is provided by the opening credits lower case/upper case letters with a mirror effect. One is the image of the other. Yet version of the letter you read in the foreground is the smaller one. The bigger capitals are in reverse. That is in essence the plot of the movie.The script is top notch--the best script of a Barry Levinson film after Good Morning Vietnam (I have not seen Diner yet). The credit falls squarely on Harley Peyton. Peyton is able to cleverly etch two distinct characters that complement each other--physically and mentally like the Italian comedy pair of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer (their Hollywood names). I would like to look at the two male characters as two sides of an ideal man just as the film credit implies. The female character would like to live with an ideal combination of both.The film to me is first a beautiful unconventional love story of two men and a woman. The bank robberies merely provide the backdrop for this. The film is amoral justice does not catch up, polygamy is okay, the film seems to imply. Yet the film is not an amorality essay. It tends to laugh at today's lifestyles--the bored housewife who has everything, riches, rich husband, dream kitchen, dream car but goes hysterical when the husband suggests they go to a movie. It laughs at management issues, including anger management. It laughs at medicine (garlic as the wonder of the century). It laughs at cooking skills...The sparring between TV and movie is not to be missed for media buffs. The film script is laughing at TV producers. Cinema seems to have the last laugh.The film would not be what it is were it not for Thornton. He carries the film. This is a top-notch performance. The make-up crew deserves kudos to make him look so good. Cate Blanchett opening scenes in her kitchen was really funny. Her character required the high strung performance that she gave. Every character in the movie comes alive because of the lines they speak (sometimes when they do not as the rich lady whose car is stolen as she stands dazed by the charm of Bruce Wills). Those wonderful lines belong to screenplay-writer Harley Peyton. What a script...! Was he influenced by Noel Coward?!!Dante Spinotti weaves magic with his camera especially with director Micheal Mann. Here too his contribution is noteworthy in outdoor shots.This movie belongs to Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett, Cinematographer Dante Spinotti, the make-up crew, and the screenplay writer Harley Peyton. Their synergy is magic. Maybe Levinson deserves a pat on the back in bringing this group together.

Bandits is near the middle (in rankings) of the caper/romance/comedy movies with Oceans 11 (Clooney and Pitt) and The (updated) Thomas Crowne Affair at the top (I'm not sure what is on the bottom of this list).The movie starts at the end with a bank-robbery gone bad and Thorton and Willis arguing while the place is surrounded by the authorities. And then, it brings you back to the beginning of the story with an implausible jail break (unless, these two were in a minimum security lock-up). Someone else's review said it best. The story does not lead up to the climax at the bank, but you are supposed to believe it will. In fact, our anti-heroes get away cleanly from a pretty messy car crash. And even though they're supposed to be stealing cars all the time, the same vintage GTO keeps showing up throughout the movie. You have to suspend a lot of disbelief to make this one work. That's not unusual for this genre, but this movie's payoff isn't as good as Ocean's 11. What Berry Levinson should have done is told this entire tale through Cate Blanchette's perspective as a female romance fantasy, because this is exactly what this movie is. The only thing missing was ripping shirts off and heaving chests. Bruce Willis could've been anybody, Billy Bob Thorton does all right, but Cate Blanchette, as a neurotic runaway housewife, chews scenery almost every time. However, 3/4 into the movie, you realize that every character exists for her, because she is the only character with any emotions. There is even a secondary female romance fantasy in which a hitch-hiker finds her dangerous boyfriend in a cool car. So, bottom line is, chicks dig dangerous cool types who can make every dream come true by running away with money. Great, thanks for the advice. Also, Bruce Willis is obviously impersonating Nigel Tuffnel in his interview with the America's Top Criminals guy, but there is no David St. Hubbins or Marty DeBerg to make these scenes work as a comedic pieces, so they just fall flat. The best way to have told this movie, would've been from the female fantasy perspective, because then you can accept all the implausible conclusions to all the set pieces.

I would recommend Bandits, it's a good film with great actors, just sit back and enjoy.6/10 "},{"Title":"An interesting attempt at something better but it doesn't pull it off despite the talent involved","Date":"28 December 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" Joe Blake and Terry Collins are criminals who are safely out of the way of the public by being locked up. However when they breakout on an impulse and rob a bank they are on the road and breaking for freedom. With the need for income, the neurotic Terry comes up with a new way of robbing banks &#150; kidnapping the bank manager the night before, staying at their homes overnight and then joining them to open up the next morning. It is a plan that works so well that the media dubs them the sleepover bandits. However when they kidnap frustrated housewife Kate Wheeler it starts a strange love triangle that threatens to break them apart.A strange affair this one. The plot is quite obvious in one regard, the delivery rather restraining and dramatically stylish, the laughs thin on the ground and the comedy takes second place to the emotional drama. It is an interesting film in what it offers but for some reason it doesn't really ever come off. It all starts lively enough with a bank-robbery caper movie with the two main characters working off one another. However in the second half it does come down to the relationships it doesn't convince and starts to fall over to some degree. The depth in the script is not really there to make this love triangle work at the level it needs to and instead it just feels a bit forced and unnatural. This uneven and unsure tone doesn't help matters and it is rather infuriating at times as it kicks out rubbish moments (eg the girl in the pink boots) and seems happy to exist on the level it does.The actors try to hold it together the best they can even though the material isn't there all the time for them to work with. Willis seems ill at ease in the latter stages but enjoys himself in the easier caper stuff. However when the emotional dramatic side of the film comes in he comes over increasingly stiff and unsure of who he is playing. Thornton is better because he has more live in his character but his hypochondriac act gets tired long before the film ends. Blanchett is the strongest as she is the only one that convinces in the second half of the film, if the others had matched her for understanding it might have been better.Overall a film of two halves, neither of which are that good or that bad. The caper side is generic enough and delivered with a sense of humour but the love triangle side is far too superficial and lacks the depth that was needed to engage me the viewer. An interesting attempt at something better but it doesn't pull it off despite the talent involved.

Easy going remake of so many teams of famous bank robbers or other thieves. The trick here is to make things that are so improbable that they necessarily succeed because no one is expecting such antics. This of course goes against the grain of modern police work based essentially on profiling. If thieves or criminals become unpredictable, hence impossible to profile, they will escape any attempt to arrest them. In other words this is the best pedagogical film for would-be criminals of the after profiling era. But that has already been done. The originality of this film is the general light tone that dominates all along. These bandits are entertaining themselves in this boring life of theirs and they are entertaining us at the same time because bank robbery is showbiz and nothing else. So let's take care of the audience and provide them with the highly original fun they are expecting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne "},{"Title":"Dreadful heist comedy (though I'm prejudiced)","Date":"9 August 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" I mentioned elsewhere that I like very few action comedies, and heist ones, and so on. But that doesn't keep me from seeing different degrees of good and bad. To me, Bandits has almost everything going AGAINST it. It's true that it has good actors, but I think it's also true that they had more funny moments in The Sixth Sense and Slingblade. If I could tell the makers one thing, it would be this - if you're going to make a movie about loveable bank robbers (even if it's an edgy one), DON'T have a scene with one of their hostages sobbing uncontrollably, while one of them sits there unconcerned. Another thing I don't like too often is medical humor, but again, without being UNABLE to notice CLEVER medical humor. And the running tumor joke just WASN'T IT. And even though I hate it when people throw around the word ripoff too easily, I have to say this about the ending - if you've never seen The Sting, it might work. I mentioned in the section on the movie Slither, that I wish other comedies of that kind at least APPROACHED it. But when it comes to not approaching that one, I think Bandits is almost in a category by itself. "},{"Title":"Boring, Boring, Boring. A career low for all concerned.","Date":"25 February 2006","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" Bruce Willis is a hard-ass robber. Billy Bob Thornton is his neurotic partner in crime. Together, they break out of prison in a cement-mixer(!) and start robbing banks to fund a new life fixing up a bar in Acapulco. Their tactics are to kidnap the manager of the joint the night before, then hold his family hostage while they use his codes to open the safe in the morning before the staff arrive. No fuss, no muss. What they don't count on is a crazy Bonnie Tyler obsessed redhead coming into the equation, thus setting out a love triangle which leads to major friction in this little group. Other characters include their wannabe Hollywood stuntman driver who loves to set himself on fire (ho ho) and a TV reporter on a syndicated crime show who apparently got the last interview of the boys before they snuffed it. In the prologue, we see them shoot each other while being surrounded by police, after apparently being betrayed by the woman they both loved. But is the legend of the Sleepover Bandits really ended that easily?YAWN. Oh excuse me, a natural reaction for anyone who has sat through this claptrap. Let's start with Brucie, who is yet again playing a variation of the cool John Mcclane guy from Die Hard. Sorry dude, we're sick of it. Next, we have Billy Bob, who finds himself as the biggest hypochondriac of all time. Oh no, I've got a BRAIN TUMOUR! I can smell burning feathers! I have ringing in my ears! Oh no, that's just the police sirens! This whining goes on throughout the movie, and it is never funny. I just felt like giving him a good slap. Lastly, is Cate Blanchett who is apparently 'Every man's wildest desire'. Well, not in this film she isn't, as a crazy housewife using frying pans as drums while singing so badly, Simon Cowell would blow his brains out. And she is such a slapper, she sleeps with a guy she's known less than an hour.. because he knows the lyrics to 'Total Eclipse Of The Heart'. I actually felt sorry for her poor husband, who is abandoned because he commits the terrible sin of going out for a business meeting when she had a dinner planned. According to her, he didn't know how to 'kiss' properly, which is why she had to leave. Try and use that in divorce court in real life, and you'll lose the kids, the house AND the Merc.Aside from the annoying performances, the real problem is there's far too much useless talk. We're promised exciting action sequences, and indeed the first one set in a jail is quite thrilling. Sadly though, we have long stretches of nothing but tedious chatter, and I had to check the DVD box just to make sure it wasn't a drama. When they do eventually get to the bank raids, everybody is just so gosh darned nice about being threatened at gunpoint and having their children kept captive, the atmosphere just turns to the surreal. Yes, we all know nowadays a lot of high profile criminals are celebrities, and people love to associate themselves with the famous. But to actually suggest the public would be honoured to be held up in these money heists, and not be climbing the walls screaming is a stretch of the imagination too far. These completely unconvincing scenes are the final nail in the coffin, and the totally predictable, so-called 'twist' ending rams it home with a bang. I'll say one thing though.. Willis & Thornton are really good crooks. Why, they've stolen an hour and a half of my life, and I have no idea how I can get it back! Any ideas? 3/10 "},{"Title":"A flawed masterpiece...","Date":"27 December 2005","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" In fact the flaw was too great that it crushed the masterpiece.**SPOILERS** I am writing this review after maybe two or more years since I last watched this film, but many things stick out in my mind, including the one thing that ruined this movie.Firstly, this film is very good at pulling you into its world early on and you endear yourselves to the story very quickly as the humour helps the opening act along.(Billy-Bob steals the show, but Bruce gives a near-perfect performance too) The plot of the film is straightforward - albeit told in a complex manner, (ie, the news report AFTER the events) but this adds to the mystery. - and is overall an original take on the crime/heist/comedy genre with an inspired choice of actors.However, this is where I feel the film fell from being a memorable comedy to one that no-one really remembers only a few years later.Where the choice of actors in Bruce Willis and Billy-Bob Thornton to play these roles was nothing short of genius, the selection of Cate Blanchett must rank alongside the greatest casting cock-ups of them all.Now, I'm the first one to say Blanchett is a fantastic actress, but this role cried for someone like Meg Ryan. Blanchett's portrayal of the female lead continued to annoy and her introduction just halted the progression of the story. Her sobbing seemed faked, her mood swings unjustified and you just could not sympathise with her whole character.What the casting department should have looked for was an actress with an innocent charm and too likable to be annoyed by.Blanchett does not have this 'innocence' or 'charm', which is why I kept on wondering about Meg Ryan in this role (perhaps with her 'Innerscape' performance in mind).BANDITS Every time I think of this film, I can't help but think of the single mistake that undermined what otherwise would have been a classic. For shame.

Then along comes a ditzy redhead (Cate Blanchett) whom they both fall in love with. Screwball comedies were popular in the 30s but they don't work now. The robbers are portrayed as nice guys who wouldn't harm a fly and no one buys that now. Credibility really goes out the window during one robbery where the bank manager is honored to be robbed by such famous men!!! Blanchett is a redhead in this movie and is not that pretty. Few redheads are. On top of that her personality turned me off seriously.I like Bruce Willis but I really hated this show and stuck with it because some people here said it had a twist ending. Yes it does, but everything else stinks.

A trio of losers start robbing banks but we never find out what happens after they do the deed. ånd there is not a single scene when bank security guards try to stop the robbery... I think this was supposed to be comedy but if so, it fails miserably, and above all else, the ending is atrociously bad, like the script, the poor direction and the overall unsatisfactory tone of this miserable attempt at a movie. This is one that makes one wish for the good old days back in the 40's and 50's when they really made good movies... "}]
