Most of the wonderful ensemble cast reunited for this sequel, but sadly, something went awry.You learn nothing about what they've seen during five years spent with the aliens . Further, it seems like everything the characters accomplished the first time around was repealed in this story. Their desire to join the aliens in the first place was predicated on a variety of factors, but each of those reasons is dissected and trashed this time out. Suddenly, there is conflict and suffering during a brief one-week visit. Characters get sick, everyone argues, nobody seems happy. As if that isn't bad enough, a tragic suicide attempt is played almost like a joke. Since when is suicide funny? Steve Guttenberg's character was integral to the first movie, but now he's just written as a clownish buffoon. The grandson's teen angst is annoying.There are a few notable moments, however. One scene between Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn is deeply touching. The plight of a captured alien being studied is properly sympathetic. But scenes like these are intermingled with a menagerie of subplots which dart around between serious and comedic.This sequel wanders too far afield from the spirit of its predecessor. The result is gloomy and disappointing. See the original, instead. "},{"Title":"It Deserved better reviews.

I believe this film would have done fairly well had it not been a sequel, but the magic was gone, sorta like the magic from the pool in the first film. The cast does a good acting job and they try, they really do, but this film just doesn't cut the mustard (from whence came THAT expression?) as compared to the first film. I'm sorry, because I truly liked the first film. This is overall a very good film and nicely acted, written and executed.

Ben (Wilford Brimley) had explicitly told his grandson that he would never see him again, it serves to cheapen that scene and many other scenes of finality in the original that they 'return' for this sequel.Another annoyance is that the hospitals and doctors that the oldsters frequent don't seem to wonder how the hell these guys have risen seemingly from the dead.That said, it's wonderful to see the senior actors return again, and some very real issues are covered which make this more than a worthwhile sequel all things considered. The scene of sacrifice with Joe (Hume Cronyn) and Alma (Jessica Tandy) is a whirlpool of emotion and I defy anyone not to be moved by this pair of stunning performances - it really does tug on the heartstrings, as much as anything in the first movie does. It's also superb watching Bernie (Jack Gilford) move on with his life by dating the feisty Ruby (Elaine Stritch) who is more than a match for the cantankerous curmudgeon. Some brilliantly moving moments as Bernie believes he is betraying his late wife by kissing another woman...And that's what the Cocoon movies do, they move you, they move senior citizens - disregarded by society - to the forefront of importance and rightfully so too, before we were around - they were. They deserve these films to showcase the hardships they have to go through in later life, where a great deal of them to crave immortality...these films take a look what if?...and then...is it what it was cracked to be.Wonderful films, wonderful actors - I'll defend these movies to the end.

Such is the case with Cocoon the Return, but the film has so good in so many ways that the it truly deserves to be watched and enjoyed.I think the first film was so spectacular because of the character portrayed by Wilford Brimley. Early on in the film, the character discusses taking risks with another character. He says something to the effect, I have not taken a risk in years. It's not the risks you take in life that you regret. It's the risks you don't take Later on in the film, the same character is discussing the possibility of going into outer space with his wife to escape the end of their lives. During the discussion he says, Well I'll tell ya, with the way nature's been cheating us, I don't mind cheating her a little. I think these two quotes capture the way the first film focuses what's important to people in life and the universal human desire to beat death.The second film deals with the issues of what is worth dying for and what is worth living for. The answer for both is love, and I think the film deals with these issues in tender and thoughtful ways. One way is the issue of self-sacrifice Whether or not we will sacrifice our lives so the ones we love can live on. Another way involves choosing to accept the limits of mortality in return for spending some time with the one you love most rather than to live forever without them. Another way involves making hard choices for the love of your children.I think the film does an excellent job with the grandfather/grandson relationship. I think it is harder for teenagers to interact with their grandparents than when they are little kids. I think teens don't always know what to say even though the love for their grandparents never diminishes. I think it is equally hard to grandparents to ever fully articulate how much their grandchildren mean to them. This film really captures this issue and there is a scene centered around a baseball game that really captures a magic moment. If I ever have a grandchild who plays any kind of sport, I am going to attend every game I possibly can and break all other commitments to be there for him or her.I think the film only fails to live up to the first movie in two ways. The first is that the film fails to provide new discoveries for the viewers. Except for one modest supporting role, there are no new characters introduced into the story. The other way in which the film falls short is that the final adventure at the end is not suspenseful. Only the final choices made by the main characters give the viewer any sense of surprise. I think the best sequels are written so that they can be watched and fully engaged by viewers who did not see the original. Aliens, Superman II, the Empire Stikes Back, and Terminator II are a few good examples. The creators of Cocoon the Return forgot this golden rule and the film fell short of its full potential.Finally, at least one critic complained that viewers never learn about what the elderly characters experienced in outer space. The critic has a valid point, but I think the film wisely focused on the issue that, no matter what supernatural experiences the elderly characters shared for five years, they remained human beings who could never deny the mortality of their children or themselves.

The initial film, Cocoon is a lovely, not-to-be- missed, golden-era style Fountain of Youth comedy and drama -- a warm, jovial charmer of an outing. The pros return for another go, and, as nice as it is to see them assembled once more, the opportunity is almost completely wasted -- making the many failures of this film seem that much more disheartening, and very nearly criminal. Don Ameche, Wilford Brimley, and Hume Cronyn all do especially good, natural character portrayals here, as does Jack Gilford, reversing his single-note, stick-in-the-mud character somewhat. Maureen Stapleton, Jessica Tandy and Gwen Verdon do another round of stellar work here as well. These amazing actors all inhabit their characters so well, so fully, and so warmly, one hopes to encounter them soon along life's highways. The writing inherits most of the blame here. (Ham-handed direction doesn't help the project, nor do any of the torturous moments in which Steve Guttenberg appears as a human -- save us!) We get no details of the group's having been away from Earth, no references to their Antarean hosts' world, no peek into any of their off-world experiences. Not even a hint, not even a dash of seasoning for the stew. Talk about a colossal, missed opportunity! The film goes through the all-too-predictable, follow-up dance steps, creates new and irrelevant problems for itself, muddies itself incessantly with meaningless and irritating subplots, rehashes most of the previous decisions made by characters in the first film, and all but dares the actors to perform this poor mess of a script. (Ron Howard dodged a bullet in wisely giving this one a wide berth.) Seeing the cast together again was a definite treat, and the sole reason for enduring this film. What a terrible shame, to have had so much possibility present, on-set, and to have shown so little return, on-screen. Mongo's Rating 3.0 stars in a 10-star world. (The rating would have been a few points higher for the privilege of simply being allowed to spend time with this marvelous, reunited (for the most part) cast -- but even so, Steve Guttenberg once again provides a considerable penalty for viewers, poisoning the film with his usual, veneer-thin acting abilities and his reverse-Midas-touch presence. In the first film, he was a barely tolerable, cloying oaf; here, he is lethal -- a saccharin, self- centered, whiny little jerk, spoiling, in many ways, what little remains of the first film's magic.)

The seniors also forget that life on earth doesn't mean being young and vibrant forever. Ben feels it when he teaches David to play baseball. Joe felt it and the doctor informed him that he had leukimia again. Now why did that worry him so much? He was going to return to Antarea in a few days so it would be gone. What's he got to worry about? Plenty, because the next day Alma is hit by a car and nearly dies. Joe transfers what Antarean energy he had left into her and he sadly died. They were all sad over the loss of their friend. Art and Ben join Kitty in retrieving the cocoon taken from the ocean. They infiltrate the oceanography center and get it back. Then they meet up with Walter in the middle of the ocean. Art and Bess would be returning to Antarea. Ben and Mary decided to stay. Alma and Bernie stayed also.

I certainly wasn't blown away by it so I didn't have a lot of expectations for it's sequel so maybe that helped but I thought Cocoon The Return was even better than the original!! They took the best part of Cocoon which was the memorable and classic characters and made a film that solely focused on THEM and their lives and everything about them and very little on the whole alien aspect but enough that it still had that supernatural element and it was just brilliant. Bringing back the original cast, putting them back in the same situations with the same set of moral questions and it was just really fun. I didn't think Cocoon The Return was nearly as campy or cheesy in dialog or even in the special effects. They didn't use nearly as many of the special effects and what they did use was much better done than the original. Director Daniel Petrie takes over from the far more known Ron Howard and does an excellent job. Petrie has mostly experience from doing TV Films which in a way is good because he's used to telling a story on a lower budget and instead he gets to tell a story with a bigger budget. He's talented to say the least having been nominated for twelve Directors Guild Awards and eight emmys and I give him great kudos for bringing these characters back to us again.Don Ameche, Wilford Brimley, Hume Cronyn, Jack Gilford, Maureen Stapleton, Jessica Tandy, and Gwen Verdon all return as the beloved seniors, most of whom return to visit their families after five years away on the other planet. They are all terrific and really bring their characters alive even more than they did in the original. They have such great chemistry together and their stories are just even more interesting. The film wouldn't be the same without them. Also returning is eighties star Steve Guttenberg who is used a little more sparingly in the sequel and he is even tolerable!! I found him a lot better this time around. Tahnee Welch returns as alien entity Kitty, and she's more of the leader this time around. Welch and Guttenberg are good together but they are both used very little and it works in the favor of the film. Welch is good in the role but comes across as a little robotic. In a rare turn of events the young actor Barret Oliver even returns to the film as Brimley's Grandson. Usually they replace a kid actor in future sequels. A pre-Friends Courteney Cox joins the cast in a relatively small but effective and emotional role and she does very well. The saddest part I thought of the cast was the lack of the amazing Brian Dennehy and imagine my delight when he returned for a small but very cool cameo in the end.For those who loved or even enjoyed the original Cocoon, you just can't help but love that they brought the original cast back for another go around because they really do focus on the great cast. They do add in the sub story about the Aliens wanting to save their friends still in the Ocean and then one of them is taking by an Oceanic research company and they have to help one of them escape...but it's just not the major focus of the film. There are some major plot turns and some really fun moments including the basketball game against the young jocks which I thought was just awesome. I mean I always suggest watching the original film because it is truly an eighties classic that is all about life and being young and turning things around but the sequel really closes a lot of gaps in the story and brings things full circle. It will leave you smiling. 8.5/10 "}]
