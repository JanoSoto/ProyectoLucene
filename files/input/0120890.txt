Wild Things is one of those trash masterpieces that is just so clever, so hot and so fun that it becomes one of the most interesting and under-rated films of the 1990s. The rich Denise Richards and the very poor Neve Campbell each accuse high school teacher Matt Dillon of rape, but there is something that is not quite right. Enter detectives Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega. They both doubt that the case is as simple as it seems. Boy are they right. The investigation leads to court where it is made clear by Dillon's attorney (Bill Murray) that the case lacks any real evidence to convict Dillon to prosecutor Robert Wagner's despair. The whole thing was a fabrication to get to Richards' mother's riches (Theresa Russell). But of course this is just the start and there will be double-, triple- and even quadruple-crossing and it is skewered who are good and who are evil or is anyone good? A brilliant screenplay by Stephen Peters and Alfred Hitchcock-styled direction by John McNaughton makes Wild Things a trashy, but highly impressive cinematic winner. 4 stars out of 5.

Here we have a film that takes elements such as beautiful stars, beautiful locations and a bucket load of plot twists and blends it all into a highly enjoyable film experience. Of course, Wild Things doesn't always come across very realistically and, at times even, it's downright ridiculous; but it's done in such a way that it doesn't matter, and because of that we have a film that can do what it wants. The film is helmed by John McNaughton, who had his first success with the cult horror flick Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer. It has to be said that the scene setting and way that the plot moves is somewhat ham-fisted, as sometimes it's painfully obvious that certain sections of the film exist only to give it another selling point; the argument that starts out between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell beside a swimming pool being a case in point. However, McNaughton makes good of these selling points, and for every three way sex scene and absurd plot twist, the film gains an extra point for trashy entertainment value.It's not immediately obvious what Wild Things is going to be about, as the first twenty minutes serve only in setting the scene and from that base, the film could easily turn into any teenage school flick. However, it turns out that this time is well used; as by nulling the audience into a false sense of security, the film is able to make sure that every twist comes as a surprise. The film benefits from a great big name cast, which is anchored by Matt Dillon; who gives one of his best performances. Dillon clearly enjoys himself, and his persona is able to suit both the sleazy and upstanding nature of his character. Kevin Bacon sleepwalks and isn't really able to show his true talent, and similarly Neve Campbell looks out of place (sexy with it) in her role as a teenage junkie. However, Denise Richards rounds the piece of nicely with a charged performance and the ensemble is nicely topped off by the likes of Bill Murray, Theresa Russell and Robert Wagner. The settings that the movie takes place in look great, and ensure that there's more eye candy than just the female leads. Director McNaughton presents a fabulously mysterious atmosphere which obviously bodes well with the plot and, on the whole, if you want a couple of hours of entertainment; you can do a lot, lot worse than this twisty little flick.

Don't forget that.'  Ray's (Kevin Bacon) sage words of advice couldn't ring more true about this tale of deception and hidden alliances.  Wild Things, set in a bayou college town, is sleazy neo-noir a la Body Heat.  The direction and acting are mediocre; however, Stephen Peters script is quite clever, delivering a number of unexpected twists that just don't let up.  It's all a bit contrived and unbelievable, but it's very fun.  The film isn't quite as sexy or explicit as the hype led viewers to expect, but it delivers enough to keep one interested until the final credit.  The menage a trois between Lombardo (Dillon), Suzie (Campbell), and Kelly (Richards) leaves a lot to be desired; it's a bit lifeless, and Dillon's facial expressions are laughable. Bill Murray is solid but miscast as a soft but sleazy lawyer, and Teresa Russell's acting skills regress with each film she makes.The final credits sequence is interesting.  It contains scenes that (fortunately) were not used for the main body of the film; if they had, they would have made some of the calculated twists much too obvious.  The very last scene between Campbell and Bill Murray, which rolls after the aforementioned scenes, extends/embellishes the story with one more twist. All the twists seem to work just perfectly like a snug-fitting puzzle. Director John McNaughton is best known for his stylish debut film Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer.  Kevin Bacon served as executive producer. Recommended on a slow evening.

I guess that's an easy approach to take when summing this film up, since its two female leads featured in Party Of Five and episodes of Doogie Howser (man what an awful show that was), not to mention that one of the male leads would be doing well to act his way out of a wet paper bag. The problem with that is that it is just too easy, and easy answer is exactly the sort of thing that this film goes out of its way to avoid. It is not trying to be a modern Hitchcock, it is not trying to be another Basic Instinct, it is just trying to tell a story.The story, such as it is, seems to revolve around Blue Bay High School, the town it is located in, and its snobby, high-income elite, at least in the first reel. We are introduced to all four of the characters who will figure prominently in the story to come during a lecture to the students in their senior year. There's Sam the guidance counsellor, Ray the corrupt policeman, Kelly the daughter of the wealthiest real estate mogul in town, and Suzie the girl from the caravan park across town. All four of these characters have secrets they'd rather not share with any other inhabitant of the town, but that all comes apart when Kelly accuses Sam of raping her. Suzie corroborates her story at first, but then we get our first inkling that things are not all they seem, through the efforts of Bill Murray in one of his best cameos ever. The whole thing is seemingly a conspiracy between Sam, Suzie, and Kelly, but we are never shown whose idea it is until the very end.This next passage will ruin a key surprise the film has in store, so don't read it if you haven't seen it. Unless things have radically changed in this regard during the last ten years, psychologists and other such professionals do not tell test subjects exactly what their IQ is. Even if Suzie or her mother did know exactly, this whole point is delivered with such sledgehammer force that it almost utterly ruins the subtle, slow buildup that the rest of the film exhibited. Were they just running out of money when it came time to film this spot and just decided to go with the quickest, simplest thing they could do? It would have been much more effective and satisfying if the ugly cop (I forget the name) had just spent five or ten minutes going through whatever Suzie had left behind on her run to the Carribean. Summing up this plot point in fifteen seconds was an exceptionally bad move.Overall, however, you can't really go wrong with this film for an evening's entertainment. It doesn't feel the need to talk down at its audience, it doesn't resort to excess simplicity to make itself understood (except for the aforementioned ending), it just tells a story and tells it reasonably well. It is also another great example of DVD's utter superiority, especially during the threesome scene. When this part of the film is shown in its proper aspect ratio, you can make out every character and certain little details I'm sure that Denise Richards would appreciate not having available to horny teenage boys in a freezable and zoomable format. When was the last time you zoomed in on an actress' boobs with a VHS cassette, assuming they were left in frame after some jerk with an editing console chopped it down to fit those garbage 43 screens?

Although I did not own the movie, you know that I went back to rent it a couple of more times because it was just so wonderful, and finally when I got the chance to buy it, I did, and now I have watched it numerous times on numerous occasions because it truly is an excellent movie that I can enjoy with every watch.Each actor and actress had a amazing role and they performed it with excellent expertise; I loved all the performances and they were all so fun and precise with the character they were given that in the long run they make the characters that would normally have been dull and uninteresting awesome and unable to look away from. The way every single line and move was so suspenseful and or clever and it just clicked all into place made my heart sink deeper into the story and never look away; I really was entertained to the point where I could not take my eyes off the screen for how amazing it was. As a Neve Campbell and Denise Richards fanatic, I enjoyed them and their luminous roles, as well as Matt Dillon who was awesome. I thought the way each and every twist and turn in the plot was just so great that my eyes lingered on for more after it was over, which is why of course I watched it a second time, and the only problem I had with this movie is that it was not long enough, though if it had have been longer I do not think it would have worked out for the better or anything, if you understand what I am trying to say.

I remember that it was singled out specifically for its graphic sexual content and violence... I will admit, yes, this is primarily what cause me to rent the film besides my interest in all three main actors= Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, and Matt Dillon. However, this was not just some dark porn as I expected but rather, a fantastic and different film that was very very interesting...Basically, Campbell and Richards are two high school seniors who have an interesting three-some relationship with their high school guidance counselor, Matt Dillon. He appears to be quite the stud throughout the film and there is an attraction to him by nearly every female character that he seems to meet (especially Richards's mom). After sexual encounters with Richards and Campbell, Richards is convinced by her parents to accuse Dillon of rape as a way to extort money from him... Dillon has quite the spotlight on him from the media and other high-authority figures, as a rape accusation directed towards any high school faculty these days is sure to raise some eyebrows. In the end, Richards/Campbell are really not working against Dillon but rather, they are working with him to in fact extort money from Richards's mother.... What a surprise!There is still conflict and tension between the trio of lovers from start to finish. The ending is quite shocking and unexpected but a great conclusion to this film noir classic...

It commences as an issue-based melodrama, except that two things seem odd the pacing is too fast (how is the story going to last the movie?) and the bizarre score seems more fitted to a comedy.  Sure enough, this straight drama is wrapped up, only to subside into a larger thriller; a thriller in which twists and turns of the plot come at an ever faster rate, until in the end the film's aim is clearly to make you gasp rather than care (this is particularly evident when the missing holes in the plot are explained through the perfunctory insertion of extra scenes into the closing credits).  So, to assess it we need to ask what's the quality of the initial set-up; how good is the twisty thriller; and how well is the transition handled?  In fact, the same answer pretty much covers all three bases badly.  The initial drama is based around a high school teacher accused of sexual abuse.  A potentially interesting situation, but presented in an absurd manner the teacher seems terrified from the start that the moment he is alone with a girl, she'll fall out of her bra for him (and it's the kind of film where a lot of falling out of bras goes on); and sure enough, the moment that it happens, the girl in question (inevitably gorgeous) is accusing him of rape (and her evil mother is trying to run him out of town).  One might suggest that one is meant to smell a rat as a lead in to the film's later development; but it's not just the details of the situation that ring false, but the portrayal of the whole world (when the girl, for example, first gives a statement, one policewoman suspects her of lying from the start, but never tells her colleagues (or us) why - indeed, all police work seems to proceed by arbitrary pronouncement at all points).The twistier second half doesn't work either, in part because the first part proved so shallow; as none of the characters are likely or believable, who the hell cares if they aren't what they seem?  As the twists mount, the whole thing feels more like a parody of a David Mamet film; one can only suppose that it's meant to be humourous, but there's no humour beyond the outlines of the plot.  And the film's final joke depends entirely on the audience's prior relationship with Bill Murray; otherwise it simply makes no sense.On the way to this disappointing end, it manages to commit most of the sins typical of films aimed at the teenaged market gross materialism, gratuitous profanity and titillation, the insensitive intrusion of popular music in almost every scene, wafer thin characterisation and the complete absence of real insight into the human condition.  In its defence, the brisk telling of the complex story ensures that, however shallow, 'Wild Things' isn't boring. But it is flimsy, exploitative entertainment hiding under the thinnest veneer of pretension. Avoid unless you've truly nothing worthwhile to do.

From Here to Eternity is an excellent film, which deserves to be remembered for many things, but it lives on in the public imagination as the film where Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr make love on the beach, even though that scene only occupies a short part of the film's running time. Similarly, The Seven Year Itch is remembered mostly for Marilyn's skirt billowing around her legs. And Wild Things, of course, is best known for That Kiss between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell, although to be honest it has so few intrinsic merits that it deserves to be remembered for little else. Sam Lombardo, a Florida high school guidance counsellor, is accused of rape by a female student, Kelly Van Ryan, the wild daughter of a wealthy family. Things start to look bad for Lombardo when a second student, Suzie Toller, comes forward to say that has also raped her. Lombardo is arrested and engages a lawyer named Kenneth Bowden to represent him. (Is it a coincidence that Lombardo has the same Christian name as, and his lawyer the same surname as, the hero of Cape Fear, another thriller set in the American South and which also involved allegations of rape?) When I started watching this film, I had no idea of the plot (except that it involved two girls kissing) and at this point I was still assuming that it would be either a traditional courtroom thriller or an issue movie about sexual abuse, but it turns out to be neither. There is an unexpected turn of events during the trial. Under cross-examination Suzie reveals that Lombardo did not rape her and that Kelly, who has a grudge against the counsellor, persuaded Suzie to join her in fabricating charges against him. Lombardo is triumphantly acquitted. Now I have long learnt to be wary of crime films which involve the sudden and unexpected acquittal of the defendant about halfway though, as this is generally a sign that a major plot twist is in the offing, the twist normally being that the supposedly innocent man is in reality as guilty as hell, if not of the crime of which he was accused then of some other felony. (There was a twist of this nature in Just Cause, another nineties thriller set in southern Florida). And so it proves here. Following his acquittal Lombardo brings a lawsuit seeking compensation and is awarded $8.5 million. The twist proves to be that he, Suzie and Kelly planned the entire incident in order to split the compensation money between them. That, however, is not the end of the story. Ray Duquette, the police officer who investigated the original rape allegations, becomes suspicious of Lombardo, and keeps him under observation. Moreover, this is not the end of the twists either. Most twist thrillers only have one main plot twist. Some, like Reindeer Games, have two. Wild Things has so many that I lost count. The whole of the second half of the movie amounted to little more than one twist after another. I haven't got space (or the inclination) to list them all here, although they all involve variants on the two most popular twists, namely-1. That a character believed to be dead is in fact alive, and 2. That a character believed to be a hero is in fact a villain. Denise Richards will never be my favourite actress; her performance in The World is Not Enough means that she must go down as one of the worst Bond girls of all times. Nevertheless, her looks and her combination of innocence and sensuality make her just right for the role of the wanton rich girl Kelly (even if, at 27, she was about a decade older than the character she was supposed to be playing). Neve Campbell was also convincing as the sluttish white-trash Suzie, but few of the other actors make much impression; the likes of Kevin Bacon, Theresa Russell and Robert Wagner are all capable of much better work than this. The real problem, however, is not with the acting but with the plot. The result of all the twists is a plot which has been twisted out of all recognition. The story, at least on a first viewing, is virtually incomprehensible, even with the assistance of a series of flashbacks intercut with the closing credits. Eventually the viewer may realise what is supposed to have happened, but this does not help much, as it means that the film simply becomes incredible rather than incomprehensible. One of the characters- I won't say which- has devised a scheme to dispose of all the others, a scheme of such baroque complexity that it bears no relation to the way in which any real human being, even the most fiendish criminal, would behave in real life. Films like this one serve little purpose other than to show off the supposed cleverness of the director and scriptwriters. Comparisons to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, a noted student of psychology, and to the best films noirs, which have a much more realistic view of human nature, seem to me to be very wide of the mark.

So it did, that the natural development of things simply lacked quality. The plot and the way it developed, appeared to be very intelligent. But on the last quarter of the story, this movie just gave itself up. The twists just happened so quickly and so roughly at the end, that it no longer was clever, but just plain stupid and comical.

I've just been browsing through the other user comments and I am alarmed to discover that they are, for the most part, overwhelmingly positive. Am I the only person who was appalled by the sheer awfulness of this movie?The most mystifying thing about the whole experience was this how could so many talented actors, actresses and filmmakers come together and make such a truly dire movie? Director John McNaughton made the critically acclaimed Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer and the subtle and involving Mad Dog and Glory, among others, and the acting talent on display in Wild Things speaks for itself. Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon and Neve Campbell have all proven that they can act, but with Wild Things McNaughton could have saved himself a lot of money by employing monkeys or, better still, full-size cardboard cut-outs.The oft-mentioned nudity is tame in the extreme - you see Richards' assets briefly and there is a needless shot of Kevin Bacon's member, but beyond that, if you're looking for cheap titillation, you may want to look elsewhere.Ok, so you do get to see Denise Richards with very few clothes on. This is a good thing. But it does not save the rest of the film from mediocrity; the much-talked-about plot twists are ludicrously overblown, the acting is wooden, the music is terrible and it is badly directed, shot and edited. Imagine an erotic thriller which is neither erotic nor thrilling and you'd be pretty close to the mark. The only thing in this film which might be described as half-decent is the tragically under-used Bill Murray in an amusing supporting role. He appears for a mere fraction of the running time, and still struggles under the cliché-ridden screenplay.Overall, this movie feels like a sort of extended episode of Baywatch or Sunset Beach, with more violence and some nudity added in to try and appeal to randy adolescents; the only audience, surely, who could possibly be interested. Why are some obviously talented filmmakers trying to peddle this degenerate, derivative twaddle? Your guess is as good as mine.

From this, I made the assumption that the movie was basically a soft-core adult film.  However, upon actually viewing it, I found that the film is actually not that at all.The story begins when a couple of high school girls accuse their guidance counselor of rape.  However, the movie is far from over after this case is settled.  Soon thereafter it stems into a complex story of trust and betrayal which all centrals around the idea of greed for money.  Every time I thought I had things figured out there was a sudden twist in the plot that took me off guard, with a different winner of the whole ordeal.  It is difficult to go much further without giving the movie away, but unfortunately the added surprise plot twists ultimately don't save the film. The constant and sudden plot changes weren't executed very well, making the story unbelievable after a while.Even though the appearance of the film at many times is misleading, I still found it to be overly cheesy at times.  This was partly due to sub-par acting.  The best performance was done by Kevin Bacon, even though I wasn't too impressed with him.  To tell you the truth I can't think of a single good Kevin Bacon movie.  It is a shame he was surrounded by the questionable acting of Neve Campbell, Matt Dillon and Denise Richards.  Neve Campbell's performance was characterized by her trademark stutter and unnecessary subtleness.  She nearly drove me crazy half-way through the movie.  Matt Dillon and Denies Richards weren't much better in the acting department. As a saving grace, Bill Murray delivered the comic relief aspect of this movie exceptionally.  It is a shame he only played a minor role in the movie.To sum things up, even though this movie wasn't exactly what I expected of it, the actual story-line was so unmemorable that it will only be a matter of time before I begin referring it to the movie where  Denise Richards, Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon engage in a steamy threesome.5/10 "},{"Title":"A film to watch if you don´t want to use your brains","Date":"18 February 2002","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  As I chose to watch this film I didn´t expect much.

At first guidance counselor Matt Dillon is accused of rape by a student, Denise Richards, and Neve Campbell, the dimwitted one, later comes forward to say she was raped too. At the trial, Neve is cracked by lawyer Bill Murray's cross exam, admits that nothing ever happened, Denise put her up to it because she was upset with Dillon. They plea-bargain with Dillon and give him a multi-million settlement not to press perjury charges.   However, less than half of the movie was over.Next, we see Dillon, Denise, and Neve in a hotel room together, celebrating their scam to get millions, and plan their future.Then we see the three of them at night on a beach, Dillon apparently kills Neve with a champagne bottle, wraps her in plastic, he and Denise carry her off in mom's car and dump the body.  All this time detective Kevin Bacon is suspicious that the truth is not yet out. Bacon is scouting Denise when he breaks in on her, we hear gunshots, he is wounded but he has to kill Denise in self-defense. A hearing determines that Denise must have been the one to kill Neve because blood in her car matched Neve's. Dillon appears to be free with the $$millions.He comes home to his beach house and finds Bacon in the shower, Hello, Partner, I didn't expect you until tomorrow. Bacon only wants his share and he's off. But the transfer will take two days, they go sailing.  Dillon, master sailer, tricks Bacon to the rail and dumps him overboard. As Bacon is climbing back in we see a harpoon shot into him. It is Neve at the trigger, not dead after all, she had pulled her own teeth and left them as evidence.So, Neve and Dillon continue sailing together, they toast. But she has put poison in his drink. She knew how to sail after all. Her mother said, She was very bright, an IQ of something like 200, she could always do anything she wanted. She is the only one left, with all the money, and presumed dead.  Shades of Body Heat!!It is a comedy, although a very, very dark one. I never felt that the script misled or tricked me, I just learned things bit by bit and was surprised each time.  Although, at the end of Bacon's firing hearing I correctly guessed by that time that he and Dillon were partners. However, my thought was more sinister -- I thought they would be gay partners. Not a movie for everyone, still very entertaining if you like a dark comedy. The DVD has a very nice Dolby 5.1 surround sound track. The extras include a couple of deleted scenes but not much worth crowing over.

It's also, however, a glossy thriller with an extremely well written plot that's intriguing, humorous and outrageously twisted. Remarkably, by the time all the explanatory flashbacks (which are included with the closing credits) have finished, it's also evident that the whole thing makes sense. Greed, betrayal and murder are the story's main ingredients but the sheer wickedness of its characters and the movie's satirical qualities also combine well to ensure that Wild Things compares favourably to most other crime-related mysteries that may be on offer.Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards) is a spoilt, 17-year-old rich girl who lives in Blue Bay, Florida. She's used to getting everything she wants but when she sets her sights on her High School guidance counsellor, Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon), things don't fall into place as easily as she expects and she accuses him of rape. Local police detectives Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez (Daphne Rubin-Vega) are charged with the responsibility of investigating the alleged crime and Perez is certainly not convinced that there is any substance in Kelly's accusation.When another girl, Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) also comes forward and makes a similar accusation, Sam Lombardo is arrested and hires lawyer Kenneth Bowden (Bill Murray) to defend him. Kelly's mother Sandra (Theresa Russell) is very wealthy and powerful and also one of Sam's ex-lovers. She's delighted to use the situation to try to ruin Sam but after the case against him collapses in bizarre circumstances and Lombardo is awarded a multi-million dollar settlement for defamation of character, Sandra Van Ryan is left furious and humiliated and looking for revenge. The course that the story takes from this point on is full of twists and double-crosses that keep on coming until the movie eventually ends with the most surprising development of them all.The characters in Wild Things include the very rich and the very poor as well as people who are employed in the legal profession, education and law enforcement. What they all have in common is that they're all morally bankrupt and most of them are criminals. The way in which they're represented on-screen is brilliant as the acting is pitched at just the right amount over-the-top to exploit the absurdity and humour of so many of the situations without allowing the impact of the more scandalous and wicked goings-on to be diminished in any way. In this respect, the entire cast is top-notch but Bill Murray does particularly well as a shyster lawyer who enjoys a good insurance scam but is also smarter than he first appears to be.Wild Things is beautifully filmed and some passages of the score wouldn't have seemed out of place in Twin Peaks. It's tremendous fun to watch and very rewarding because it delivers so much more that it initially seems to promise.

Her saucy beauty, her high-school-cheerleader charm, and her fiery sexiness (not to mention her eminently drool-worthy bod) effortlessly energize the flick and give it sass and spice, most certainly, definitely in that by-now-iconic champagne-pouring three-way between her, Dillon, and Campbell and that equally-legendary girl-on-girl-in-the-pool action between her and Campbell (Also of great help Theresa Russell's firmly pant-inducing sashaying and swaying as Richards's high-society mother). The film has inspired three, count 'em, three sequels, but it's Denise who makes the original continue to stand tall.

Sam may be guilty, in the eyes of some, because Suzie, who is 'trailer trash', walks out of a presentation on sex crimes that Sam is leading.  Sam claims to be innocent, and he hires Kenneth, a sleazy lawyer.  From there, the movie takes a number of exciting twists and turns, and just when you think you've got it all figured out, everything goes off in a different direction.  I was able to take pride in knowing that just because I didn't see certain things happen, they might not have happened.  But that didn't make this movie predictable.The plot twists were very exciting.  Something unusual at the end  we did get to see the scenes that were 'left out', filling in the gaps and explaining the seemingly unexplainable. I don't recall any spectacular acting performances, but Bill Murray was good, even though this wasn't really a comedy.  As Sam's scheming attorney, he made it seem like a comedy, though somehow he did seem out of place with the others. I was glad I got to see this movie cleaned up for TV.  It was naughty enough as it was, though the girls did look good in their skimpy outfits.I believe this was worth seeing.

(SPOILERS!!)You're introduced to the school counceller of 'BlueDale' High, or whatever it is called, who is a popular guy - with the ladies - and is liked by the students. Denise richards plays the sexy high school princess who fancies him and cambell plays a 'druggie'.Now, bear with me, this is complicated beyond belief. The two girls accuse the counceller of raping them. When it goes to court, it alls goes wrong and its revealed it was a hoax played by the two girls. You then find out the counceller was in on it, so all three could receive the settlement money ($8million) - a little twist, gives the film interest and thats fine, but then it goes completely random - the amount of double-crossing and twists is insane. By the end of it, you don't give a damn who got away with all the money as you never really get to see enough of each character to be able to like them or at least like the fact that they 'won' For example, the counceller seems like a nice guy as you are able to see as he is in a lot of the early scenes, but then he turns into this mysterious evil guy. The Detective that has been attempting to reveal the counceller and girl's plot seems like the good guy. When he fails near the end, you think 'oh but hes bound to catch the counceller' but no...hes in it with the counceller... Somehow, it ends with the druggie, Susanne, getting away with the money - regardless that you think shes been killed earlier on, and even seen her 'dead' body wrapped in some clinfilm or whatever.Overall, it is quite funny, sexy and well directed in some cases, however the plot is way too complex for you to care, and just seems like the writer wanted to shock you continuously - he must be a fan of the 'shock factor'i give it 3/10 - for denise richards, some sex scenes and a decent screenplay  "},{"Title":"A Good Combination of Film-Noire with Teenage Movie Elements","Date":"12 May 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Since I rather dislike what I call teenage movies (i.e. films that feature storylines about teenagers being naughty at school, making mischiefs, attempting their first datings and sex, etc.), I was negatively predisposed before seeing Wild Things. Fortunately, I was very wrong Although the film has many of the so-called teenage movie elements, it is actually what we should call a film-noire, and a good one in fact.The story involves two beatiful young girls, rich and spoiled Kelly (Richards), and weirdo and freaky Suzie (Campbell). In between them stands guidance councelor Lombardo (Dillon) whom they both accuse for rape, something he vehemently denies. Sgt. Duquette (Bacon) and Det. Perez (Rubin-Vega) are investigating the case, which is definitely much more complicated than it seems...The plot is intriguing, with numerous twists. So numerous in fact, that every now and then the viewer has to alter his perception of what he/she thought had been happenning up to that point Actually, some plot hints are even given after the The End screen, as we are shown additional explanatory shots between the credits!The acting is generally satisfactory, with the first-league actors (Bacon and Murray) definitely standing well ahead of the rest; Rubin-Vega is also very good in her role, while Dillon is simply OK. The two young female protagonists (Richards and Cambell), while not bad in their acting at all, get the prime attention for their hot and promiscuous looks...The scenery is also good, with the glades and the swamps giving a special color to the film.In brief, Wild Things wins you, and the prime reason for this, is its clever plot. 8/10.

Dillon plays a revered high school guidance counselor who is one day accused of rape by teen nymphet Richards.  Bacon is the investigating policeman, Murray is Dillon's crafty lawyer and Campbell is a troubled and troublesome student who has interest of her own in the case.  Russell is well cast as Richards shrewy mom.  Wagner is her appropriately slimy lawyer pal.  Snodgrass has a hilariously authentic role as Campbell's trailer trash mom.  Rubin-Vega, as Bacon's partner, is an anchor of sorts for the audience.  This court case is but the tip of the plot and to give away much more would really spoil half the fun of watching all the characters run through the ever-surprising story.  Almost none of the characters are what they appear to be.  And none of this is to be taken seriously.  The film is chock full of riotously trashy dialogue, ornery sex and phallic imagery (in Bacon's case, literally!)  The musical score is quirky and unusual with clever use of songs.  The Florida setting adds a lot to the flavor of the movie.  Dillon is adequate, though not fully believable, as an inspirational educator.  Bacon does a fine job and is to be commended for his willingness to let it all hang out (again, literally!)  Campbell is a real surprise in her part.  All decked out in dyed hair, gothic lipstick and tattoos, she is as far away from Party of Five as one can get!  However, her later scenes in the film are less effective.  It would be hard to conceive of a sexier person than Richards.  Her 10,000-watt smile, Playmate hair and gravity-defying breasts are displayed here with full force.  If the film had done any better at the box office, she'd be an international sensation.  The film has the distinction of breaking the laws of logic during it's telling, then showing left out moments during the closing credits to fill in how the story really did unfold.

But I don't think it's a wild, sexy thriller. Wild Things stars Matt Dillon as Sam Lombardo, a guidance counselor at some school of some sorts (although I've never been to a school where you can learn how to sail). One of his students (Denise Richards) accuses him of rape, and his life is turned upside down. And when a second student (Neve Campbell) comes forward with a similar story, all hell breaks loose. But this is just the beginning. I have never seen a movie with so many twists and turns before. Just when you think you've got it figured out, they throw something else at you. Here's the problem. It's just too damn far-fetched. You know what I was thinking when I finished watching it? I was thinking about the O.J. trial. If you believe that O.J. was innocent, you'd have to believe that there was this huge conspiracy between the police, the District Attorney, and everyone else involved. If you believe what happens in Wild Things, then chances are you too believe O.J. is innocent. You remember The Usual Suspects? Now that was a good movie. There were twists and turns, but the story somehow seemed believable, because the people seemed believable. And the ending, although shocking at first, made sense and I at least, turned it off thinking it was the best script I'd seen in a long time. I left Wild Things thinking that the director must have known something was wrong, because I'd never seen a movie where they had to explain to you what happened during the closing credits.   Everyone is back stabbing everyone else. Cops are not who they seem to be, students aren't who they seem to be. Lawyers are never who they seem to be. Now for the good things. I love Neve Campbell (as I'm sure most men my age do), and you get to see a lot of Denise Richards, if you know what I mean. And the ladies aren't left out either, because you get to see all, and I mean all, of Kevin Bacon (he's a cop). The performances weren't all that spectacular. I never believed a word Matt Dillon was saying, and the rest of the cast just sort of phoned in their work. I did like the background music. Although the movie took place in Florida, the music made me feel like I was in New Orleans for some reason. Anyway, if you enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I certainly do, go ahead and check out Wild Things but don't expect to really like the story, because while it started out OK, by the time you get to the last 20 minutes, it all just falls apart.

The problem with it is that it apparently takes into account only the male audience, which is supplied with abundant eye candy under the form (forms?)

To describe this film as film noir is a just a joke it not clever in anyway and certainly offers nothing new to a genre that as been overlooked on mainstream cinema for years.

But.....oh, I'm so.....I'm sorry, the film ISN'T about the gorgeous leads pouting, and getting it on with each other, NO, it's really a thriller - honest, it is!Yeah right!!!This is just a sexy thriller, with more attention on the 'sexy' rather than the thriller parts of the film. Don't get me wrong though, this film works well. It is a good film, but the sex and the breasts and everything else, just seems to distract from the rest of the film.It's got a good plot, and the acting is as good as it was ever gonna be, but don't expect a Hitchcockian style film. It has many twists and turns yes, but when you think about it, it was all so obvious!! Of course, thanks to the eye candy, we are not fully concentrating on the finer plot details, and a 2nd or 3rd viewing will show us to be really stupid. Oh well, we're only human eh?The end credits are a nice touch showing us what actually happens before the film started and what happened throughout that was withheld from us.So, if your in the mood for gorgeous men and women, and don't mind if your brain will TRY to work out the plot, then give this one a go.Whoever you are, you'll be begging for a threesome!!(I've seriously gotta stop thinking about that!!!

The title Wild Things couldn't describe the characters' natures better. Anyway, this movie was a twist-a-minute, completely sexy, amazingly intriguing and brilliantly acted film. I enjoyed the heck out of it, and was something extremely different in cinema these days, and is very welcome for repeated viewings. The film was executed very well and had some nice editing tricks. The acting was a very strong point in the film. The characters in this movie are rather hard to play and quite complicated. The casting was chosen well and the four leads are stunning. Neve Campbell was superb. She was very dark and had the most interesting character in the movie. Denise Richards actually showed us she could act subtlety, and not just as a porn star wannabe. Kevin Bacon was mysterious but didn't have enough involvement in the plot. Matt Dillion's character was very engaging and he acted out his thrilling scenes with shocking emotional faces and a captivating voice. The script for this movie is brilliant. As I said before, the movie has twists every minute and something is always happening on screen. I liked the way the script cut between the most shocking scenes, it always leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. Overall, Wild Things is one heck of a film, a love-it-or-hate-it experience that personally I loved. This is a movie could well start up a new style of shocks-per-second. A great flick, and endlessly entertaining!

However there's a lack of evidence, until Suzie, another student of Sam's, also claims that she was raped by him. After that the story gets really confusing as to who did what and why.The thing that ruined this movie was the seemingly neverending twists in the plot. It can happen only so many times in a movie before you feel that it's not the characters in the movie who are fooling you, but the producers. Lots of spoilers ahead...Due to the innumerous plot twists, there are many holes in the story. As we find out at the end of the movie, Suzie was blackmailing Sam all along. Why didn't he kill her when she was drunk? We also find out that Ray (Kevin Bacon, the detective), was also involved in the scheme and that he didn't know that Suzie was behind it all (which would have given him reason to be suspicious). Why did he encourage the police to continue the investigation jeopardizing the very plot he is involved in? Thses are just some examples.Other than those holes in the plot, it was decent movie. The acting was mostly good, I don't like Neve Campbell, but she was good in this movie. Aside from the occasional scenes when a viewer can tell they're acted, the acting is believable and the story is also great in the beginning, but it gets a little overcomplicated at the end. The sexuality was a bit forced, because it didn't fit into the storyline as much as it did in 'The In Crowd'.GOOD A well acted movie with an interesting plot and many (too many for my taste) surprises.BAD It has an unrealistic ending due to the holes in the complicated plot.

'Wild Things' is the kind of film that knows its a film- instead of constructing a more believable plot, it just wants to throw every possible twist in the book without really thinking about believability.The ending is totally laughable...I practically yelled Yeah right!. Therefore one must presume that it's target audience was teens. The cast is okay, except Denise Richards!

Rent teen-slasher 'Scream' instead-  which has better constructed story and it cleverly pokes fun at itself.

Well yes and no. Although the plot delivers an opportunity for a great thriller, the young actors fail to convince on about any level, and the writer uses the premise to cram twice as many twists in the story as any normal moviegoer would have the right to expect.Plotwise and stylistically, this is probably closest to Basic Instinct, trying to make a sexy whodunnit thriller with good looking actors, mysterious music and (intentionally) a slow pace. However, this movie doesn't even come close to match the tension created by BI, mainly because John McNaughton can't make up his mind whether he's making a high school drama or a murder mystery. The transition from the former into the latter kills the tension, because the question that rises when you watch this film is not - 'How is it gonna end?' but - 'What the f**k is going on?'. And I guarantee you for most of the time you will have no idea what's going on, and the main problem is, you will not give a damn either.The young actors are uniformly dismal, with Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell and Denise Richards all working at their blood-suckingly worst. Matt Dillon is the most unconvincing teacher ever to hit the screen, it's pretty clear that Denise Richards wasn't hired for her acting skills, and every time Neve Campbell opens her mouth you're guaranteed to be irritated. On the acting front, only Kevin Bacon (as a convincing a**hole) and Bill Murray (who seems to be brilliant in every role) come off unscratched, and of all actors mentioned these two have the only prospect of a lasting Hollywood career.That said, I must admit I enjoyed every second of this film. If you don't care about a sensible plot and characters, the one reason you should see this film (beside THAT scene) is because you'll have a lot of fun working out what will be the next twist (and there are many).

The plot of the movie is a quite different matter. I mean, there is really not much new here. It is an old story and it is not very interesting. This film tries to make it interesting by twisting the story repeatedly throughout the movie - especially the last 20 minutes of it. The producers probably thinks this is very clever, but I think that it is either confusing or just not credible. And when you finally think it is over, the movie insists that we have to know how it all got possible by showing some unnecessary clips in the end. So conclusively, the movie should be seen especially for Denise Richards fantastic body, which you get to see quite a lot of, and maybe for the great atmosphere in it mostly due to that exquisite saxophone (thank you George Clinton).

He proceeds to run his hands up and down Kevin's lithe, rugged back. The steam rises. Matt's torso glistens. His lips part. Suddenly, the shower door opens. It is Bill Murray in a surprise plot twist. I mean, who you gonna call? The men stare at Bill and notice something. He is naked. He grins that old Bill Murray smirk. He steps in with them. The two men begin to massage Bill all over with soap. Slowly, Bill sinks to his knees and......Does anybody have that fantasy? Me neither.

There are more plot twists then Scream and any Hitchcock movie put together, and some of the gaps aren't filled in until after the credits start rolling.  Two girls, one a preppy popular girl named Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), and one a trailer trash swap feeder, Suxie Toller (Neve Campbell), accuse their high school guidance counselor of rape.  Now this is where it gets confusing.  After a while it is clear whether or not he committed the rape, but I can't tell you because it would spoil the movie.  Then it is unclear who exactly are lovers.  A bunch of people get killed, but you never know if they really are dead, or just being faking it.  The plot is original, however, and the two girls are incredibly attractive, so that's a plus.  But on the downside, I didn't know what was going on for more than half of the movie.

This film is aimed so squarely at the young heterosexual male market that it's pitiful plea for respectability (tick off the Hitchcock references) must have been the only thing to prevent the producers from casting a less principled actress than Campbell and going straight for the top-shelf.Wild Things is not misogynist per se, since the men are as guilty as the women. Indeed, every character is a fraud of some description and since Bill Murray's is the only one to admit as much, he is easily the most charming of a thoroughly abhorrent lot, most of whom get what they deserve. However, it is hard to imagine what possible appeal this could have to female audiences who don't find Matt Dillon's smug grin or Kevin Bacon's damp member enough to reduce them to dribbling lust.There isn't so much a plot here as a series of excuses; for another illogical character-reversal, some pretty scenery or another shot of Richards scantily clad figure, who's cleavage the Director of Photography must have had burnt on to his retinas by the end of the shoot. In amongst it all there is a well-executed parody struggling to get out. The small-town California instincts are played up nicely with the community sub-dividing itself in to various factions who don't so much live together as co-habit. Theresa Russell has fun as Richards (naturally) sluttish mother who has slept her way around Blue Bay and still has a crush on Dillon's teacher-of-the-year. At the other end of the social strata, there is the inevitable swamp trash represented by Campbell and her family of in-bred crocodile trainers. The script is at pains to highlight the differences between these two lifestyles at first but soon gives up when the convoluted murder/black-mail/double-cross system gets in place.In the end this emerges as a competent thriller, high on titillation, low on logic, and acted with general apathy. Executive producer Bacon is particularly tedious, especially when his presence starts to dominate the second half. What you are left wondering is why these people should have bothered in the first place. Granted Campbell is given the chance to show another side to her usual vulnerable-innocence persona, demonstrating vulnerable-guilt instead and Richards is presumably aware that an array of bikinis, pouts and lesbian clinches (champagne-splattered breasts inclusive) will hinder her career none and makes you wonder why she refused Verhoeven. Otherwise Bacon and Dillon seem merely to be waving to each other on downward trajectories, while director McNaughton has finally given in and admitted he is simply a peddler of forgettable trash.Of course, none of this really matters a damn to those who will watch Wild Things, since it is not a bad evenings entertainment if you would rather not have to deal with anything too cerebral and are willing to forgive the dubious quasi-racism and ideological hypocrisy on offer. And unless you hoped to see Neve in the buff, chances are you'll get exactly what you paid for.

It was bad because there were plot twist for the sake of plot twist as they had no real purpose in the movie.  The supposed hot sex scenes were nothing but cold and tame.  One thing interesting about this film is like many of the director's previous films, it gives a person(Sam Lambardo) who seems like a normal guy but is really a sexual sociopath(he beings with Henry(HenryPortait of A Serial Killer), the alien(The Borrower), and Ashley Judd's prostitute(Normal Life) of people who are not as they seem to be).  The sex scenes in the movie shows the difference between European and American filmmakers(I.E. Hollywood) and that is the Europeans are more open about filmming sex scenes while the Americans are very repressed and closed minded.  I really dislike this movie so much that I can't believe it was done by the same person who directed HenryPortait of A Serial Killer(1986).

It was a smart thriller that seemed to have no major holes.There were many surprises - especially the closer to the end we got. It is somewhat ridiculous to believe all these could have happened without more hitches, BUT as long as the movie doesn't have holes, we have to suspend disbelief. Still, because it had just one or two too many twists, I couldn't quite give it a 9. I actually thought about even one or two MORE twists that could have been added to make it REALLY ridiculous. In theory, you could go on forever.The movie did one thing I have never seen before. At the end of the movie after the credits started rolling, they interjected scenes that we did not see - those scenes we saw from a distance and had to speculate (or subconsciously made assumptions) on what happened. The beauty of this is that it filled out the story and answered any remaining questions, but yet did not give us that information DURING the story. Clever and effective.The characters are very intriguing. Everyone is great to look at. The sex appeal between all involved just about breaks the thermometer. I found it vaguely similar to Body Heat - a movie that I rated a 9 and really liked a lot. It has the same kind of twists (though more of them), sensuality, attractive characters, crime, beach-as-the-reward, etc. I think it is safe to say if you liked that movie, you will like this one as well.

However, I HAD heard of the twists and turns that this movie possessed, and last night when I saw that it was on and since there was nothing else to do I watched it.Without a doubt this movie is trashy.  There is an excess of both violence, sex, and language.  But, the truth be known, I actually liked the movie. This is one of those movies where I can recommend it, but I can only highly recommend it if you can catch it in an edited version.  Why they can't make movies like this as PG-13 movies I don't know.  Everything that was gratuitous in the movie was unnecessary.  Oh well.....Getting to the movie, this was definitely Hitchcockian in feel.  Every time that you think that you have it figured out, the plot is changed on you. At least that is how it is supposed to be.  I saw almost every plot twist coming.  There were, however, a couple that completely stunned me.  That is what makes the movie worth seeing.  If your sick of all of the 'hero saves the day' movies that Hollywood seems to churn out regularly then you definitely need to see this movie.  What really chills me is that it almost appears that they intentionally led you into a false sense of security by feeding you a few predictable plot twists in order to catch you on the really big ones.What especially makes this movie Hitchcockian is its habit of not showing scenes and allowing your imagination to play things out on its own.  The method of manipulating you in that manner is masterful.  Most of the missing scenes are actually played at the end of the movie during the credits in a manner that I am not sure whether Hitchcock would have approved of or not. Regardless, they are still wonderful and add a whole other dimension to the movie.In summary, I give this movie a 8/10.  It would have been a 9/10 if not for all the gratuitous sex.

Secondly, the four characters they play are so unlikable that frankly by the end of the movie I was hoping they'd all get whacked.I've read some compliments about the acting but personally I feel everyone except perhaps Denise Richards was miscast.  Matt Dillon as a wholesome guidance counselor who may have a dark side?  He normally plays the opposite and it bothered me.  Sorry, but with the number of movies he's been in where's he's played a punk (especially his teen movies), I just have a hard time seeing him as a responsible adult--not necessarily his fault, but that's how I view him.  Kevin Bacon plays a tough cop who makes no bones that he's also a mean sumbitch--another against-type casting, I suppose, and Bacon is OK but why get a substitute when there are many b-grade actors who can play this role more convincingly in their sleep?  Richards is okay but that's because she's supposed to play a vapid dim bulb anyway, as opposed to unintentionally playing it in her other films.  Neve Campbell is moderately convincing as Swamp Trash Susie but in a movie that prominently promoted and featured a menage a trois between Dillon, Richards, and Campbell, I would've preferred a more interesting & attractive actress.Here's how I would've cast it -replace Matt Dillon with...Bill Pullman or Tom Hanks (!! now that would've been worth seeing). -replace Kevin Bacon with...Ed Harris -replace Denise Richards with...well, she can stay -replace Neve Campbell with...Melissa Joan Hart (if only for the threeway...forget Sabrina, this is Hollywood, baby!)

Then, white trash Suzy Tuller (the never better, Neve Campbell) accuses him of rape too. Two suspicious cops (Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega) investigate the rape charges put on by the girls, and soon the plot twists begin.

After watching it, I realized that I was corrected. What I never guessed, however, was how entertaining the movie actually was. This movie has more unexpected twists in it than it can actually tell in its 113 minutes, so in the ending credits they're still explaining the hidden elements. This is a clash of originality, sex, humor and suspense and fun.The movie's plot is so annoying, yet smart and trashy. The filmmakers give only enough information away so that we can't figure anything out on our own, and that we can guess and interpret things maybe differently that a person watching the film from a different angle.It takes place in a Florida town called Blue Bay. It's a little city where alligators roam the green tropical swamps and marshes that look creepy and uneasy. Matt Dillon plays Sam Lombardo, a well respected high school guidance counselor, who at the beginning, hosts a seminar about sex crimes. Kevin Bacon is officer Ray Duquette, and his partner, played by Daphne Rubin-Vega, is named Gloria Perez.Then the film introduces the attractive young Kelly Van Ryan, the rich spoilt but unhappy brat of Sandra Van Ryan, who is having an affair with Lombardo. The father of Kelly killed himself, leaving the two of them lonely and hapless for years.Another key player in the film's plot is Suzie Toller (Campbell), another young lady who lives in a beat-up trailer behind an alligator farm, and is not so wealthy.Soon after the characters are properly introduced, Kelly follows Lombardo home, asks for a ride to someplace, washes his car, and appears in his living room so wet and seductive, only the imagination can wonder what happens next, for all that we see in Kelly leaving the trailer of Sam's after a while looking mad. Latter, we learn that she is testifying that she was raped by him. Her mother is outraged.The movie follows a series of over six twists (I counted, but I may have missed a few, it is hard to tell.) many double crosses, unexpected turns, character deceptions and even a few triple crosses leaving only the phrase that comes to mind that no one is who they seem to be.The actors are indeed a little soap opera like. That is Especially true for Denise Richards, from Starship Troopers, who's entirety seems so over acted and fake, put on that I didn't even buy her character.  Who is devilishly perfect, however is Neve Campbell. My raves go out to this person who is capable of a performance tower above all others here. Kevin Bacon and Matt Dillon both were right on the mark, here. While Theresa Russell and Bill Murray did what they could in what little screen time they had.After screening Goodbye, Lover a few days ago, and Wild Things today, I am beginning to realize what movie like this are all about; they exists only to keep an audience guessing what will happen next, but then, they don't necessary know what already has happened, now do they?

Secondly, this movie was created as a typically modern American version of a 'steamy thriller'. This means effectively very soft sex and nudity (although the menage a trois pushed it a bit) and some weak attempt at suspense. And that's what you got. Thirdly, movies do not (and have never actually) really required one character for the audience to sympathise with. This is a weak formulaic construct. Fourthly, if you leave a movie before the end of the credits you deserve to miss out on additional info. Movies do not start with the opening credits or end at the beginning of the closing credits. Simple. (Besides, you miss all the interesting technical stuff) Now, this movie has some twists and turns but it is a long way from hard to follow. The acting isn't sterling, but it is certainly adequate (except for Robert Wagner - I totally agree with a previous comment on this one. His puffed up macho/aggressive manner was almost laughable). There is a little bit of tension - but only insofar as you wonder who'll kill who next. Finally, I watched this movie for free so I can't really complain but it isn't worth the 7.3 or so its currently running at. I imagine this will settle down with time.

It deserves its top marks. Of course, in the history of cinema it probably won't be talked about in the same terms as other 'classics,' such as The Godfather and Empire Strikes Back. 'Wild Things' is a different type of film for a different type of audience.It's a twisty-turny thriller where you can't really say too much about the plot without giving away important information that is best left kept secret until you actually watch it. Basically, it involves plenty of glamorous (and murderous!) back-stabbing, by beautiful people in beautiful locations. If you've watched the trailer (and I suggest you don't, seeing as that too gives away more than you really need to know) then you'll see that there's a strong 'sexual element' to it. Therefore, critics can easily dismiss the film as just some (slightly classier) p0rn and leave it at that.Yes, sex is an important part of 'Wild Things,' but, like I say, it's so much more than that. Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon, Neve Campbell are all great, but, for me, the stand-out performances come from Denise Richards and Bill Murray. Murray normally turns in an excellent performance in whatever he does, so you'll probably expect it from him. However, since Wild Things, Denise Richards has taken more than her fair share of criticism concerning her acting abilities. I can tell you though she shines here (and I'm not just talking 'visually!') and even gets what I would say is the best line of the film &#x96; something about 'taking the car,' but you'll have to watch the film to see the context she uses it in.If you're not offended by plenty of sex in a film and you like your films with more plot twists in than a filmic corkscrew, then give Wild Things a go. Just be sure to sit through the credits for added scenes which explain a lot of what's happened (when I first saw this in the cinema, I noticed that some people actually left the moment the screen went black &#x96; they really missed out!). Also, don't watch the sequels &#x96; I mean it &#x96; just don't. They're basically the same film, only done worse and if you've seen the original you'll have seen it much better.

Investigating their claims is Detective Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) who suspects the assault claims may be a conspiracy involving the teacher and the two girls to try and get at Kelly's trust fund money. And Bill Murray is in this. I throw this information in at the end of the plot summation so it can be as arbitrary as his appearances in the film.The film gives us a little glimpse of Kelly's decadent Upper class family situation and Suzie's plight as a member of the under-class, but the film is not trying to say anything about this, simply underlining the differences between the two girls and also getting us to pity both women.There are a lot of twists and turns in our story, and they do come together quite well at film's end end and it all makes sense on a second viewing. You even find out why the hell Bill Murray is in this movie! This film is infamous for its lack of subtlety, including a (relatively tame) threesome sex scene, lesbian kissing, and a full frontal shot of Kevin Bacon in ALL of his glory. Also notable for Richards' over the top outing as a conflicted femme fatale. This is easily her best film role. Dillon's performance is probably the film's high point. Once you know what the film is about and the true motives of the characters, you can really appreciate what he does with Lombardo. Campbell is excellent as well.In the end, Wild Things has a lot of flaws, and is easy to poke fun at, but the bottom line is it works. All of the performances, story threads and over the top sexiness come together to make an entertaining and satisfying film. Not classy by any means, but it works.

Detectives Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega launch an investigation given that Richards's mother, Theresa Russell, is filthy rich and not taking this lying down so to speak. Dillon's reputation is further besmirched when another student - poor white trash Neve Campbell comes forward to also claim sexual assault. Did Dillon really do it or is this some bizarre revenge plot playing out? Trash can be incredibly fun if it is made right or incredibly boring and laughable if made badly. Making great trash is very tricky. Wild Things is great trash and I mean that as a compliment. It knows it is trash, it does not have any aspirations to be anything better than what it is and it revels in the fact that it is trash. Director John McNaughton does not miss any chances to play up the sultry Florida heat or intersperse his scenes with knowing clips of gators cruising the waterways, likening them to the various predators cruising the screen.Other than McNaughton's assured direction, there are a gaggle of other aspects to the film that click in just the right way so that the viewer is in on the fun and games as they unfurl. The screenplay is surprisingly inventive and tight. The sexual assault angle and subsequent courtroom mayhem are only the starting point for a rather complex plot. The film twists and turns with characters double-, triple- and occasionally quadruple-crossing each other. There are so many surprises that they keep coming even after the credits have started to roll.It also helps that the film is so unabashedly sexual, even with two leads known at that time for avoiding excessive skin. Richards is a limited actress - and I use that last term advisedly - but the film truly knows how to utilize her. Showing up at the start at Dillon's house for a charity car wash she looks like a walking porn movie. The film progresses to include a titillating threesome, a lesbian flirtation between Campbell and Richards and the now legendary shower scene where Kevin Bacon...well, shows his impressive bacon.The rock solid cast also helps matters and they seem to be having a blast. They pretty much play everything straight rather than tongue in cheek, which keeps the audience guessing and entertained. Dillon walks a fine tightrope as a guy who may just be too good to be true. Bacon provides just the right touch of world-weariness as one of the investigating officers with just a flourish of sleaze to keep the audience wondering about his own motives. Campbell probably has the most difficult contribution. She needs to be sexy without being overt, enigmatic, vulnerable and yet convey a certain degree of intelligence to guide the audience through some of the twists. To her credit, the viewer rides along freely and only after the film concludes does one realize how improbable some of her character's motivations are. Richards is undoubtedly the weakest link in the cast, but her sexpot looks, sledgehammer delivery and broad acting actually serve her character here well. The supporting cast is littered with a surprising array of familiar faces, all looking like they are enjoying themselves. Russell as the rich mother, Oscar nominee Carrie Snodgress as Campbell's mother, Robert Wagner as a rich friend and Bill Murray as a shady attorney all have moments to shine and plot points to contribute.Ironically, I think this may well have been the last successful potboiler that Hollywood has provided, as I am hard-pressed to remember a more recent successful example.

And there's Bill Murray as well. But then midway thorough it all comes undone, badly.The film tries very hard indeed to be intelligent by constantly second-guessing the viewer via the means of twists and swerves but fails badly. The twists don't add anything worthwhile and instead sabotages the whole story, leaving gaping plot-holes everywhere. The characters are also just unbelievable. They try the 'you think you know them but you don't' trick but instead they come up with characters that have no real 'character'. They constantly switch personalities and then back again at will with zero sense behind it. All these would probably have been overlooked but for the fact that the 'BIG' twist right at the end just encapsulates all that is wrong with film and then magnifies them. The ending just well happens and the viewer is just left wondering 'what the?!'. It doesn't build towards it, it just happens leaving one shaking one's head in disbelief and disgust. NOT intelligence, pure stupidity.A too contrived film with an ending that's just ridiculous ruins what could and should have been a cracker.

However this movie for sure is a classic. His previous movies 'mad dog and glory' and 'henry, portrait of a serial killer' simple movies. But this movie is a step ahead from the rest. Mcnaughton has brought to the screen a complex and ingenious script in grand style. In my opinion much credit is due to the writer for creating such a novel idea.The movie is based on how characters manipulate others to commit murders and plans while maintaining a devious secret association with a second individual. The theme itself is not groundbreaking or completely original as it has this type of plot device as been used in a 1979 made for TV movie 'Murder by Natural Causes'. Each character is involved in a scheme which turns deadly and risky as the element of greed takes its turn. All the necessary elements and ingredients are contained in the movie to fulfil everyone's tastes. Not forgetting that two scenes of a erotic nature are placed at appropriate moments to exhalerate the interest. *****************SPOILERS AHEAD******************** Matt Dillon is a high school guidance councillor who is accused of rape by Denise and Neve. This is a surprise to him as he is against the allegations. Defense attorney Bill Murray is approached by Matt to fight his case. In the lead up to the court trials he losses his self respect, home and girlfriend. However at the trail it turns out eventually that he was wrongfully accused as Neve admits the truth behind her accusation. Eventually Matt is compensated a large amount by Denise's mother (Theresa Russel) after a lawsuit is filled. Howvever it turns out later that the trio of Neve, Denise and Matt have preplanned and staged this drama act scheme for the money. Kevin Bacon the detective senses foul play and intends to investigate further to to prove his doubts. The stakes get higher and becomes involved within the characters plan of murder and faking deaths. *************END OF SPOILERS**************The movie has a fantastic atmosphere which is complimented with a good background score by George Clinton. He has understood the tone of the movie to incorporate the relevant music. The simple piano tune's charm can be noticed in the final 10 mins of the movie, which in my opinion can be eligible for on of the greatest climax in movie history. The first hour of the movie sets the background to the plot as well character development. However the movie's speed increases after the court trial sequence. It is after then where Neve and Kevin's character bring larger involvement in to the plot, as we can experience a 'colombo' de ja vu. The pace is steady in the movie and neither does any portion tend to move fast or slow. Much of the second half is full of character twists and turns that bring the movie to a nail biting climax. The background to the plot twists are revealed in the end credits which is another highlight to the movie. The locations of sourthern Florida is beautifully shot and realism sets in well. My only advice is not to watch the trailer as this reveals much of the plot and surprises and it tends to spoil the movie's true enjoyment.Kevin Bacon gives a mature performance and there are two different shades to his character that he balances well. Neve Campbell performs well. She is devious as well as evil in the second half. Denise Richards is seductive and sexy but does not have much involvement in second half neither. However she does exhibit her body to the full potential.

But when the case goes to court with Lombardo defended by Ken Bowden, things take the first of many unexpected twists.Ask yourself at the start of the movie what you want to get out of it.  Are you looking for a smart thriller that will leave you breathless or are you looking for a couple of sexy moments where gorgeous girls get naked and kiss each other?  If you want the former then `The Usual Suspects' is probably still available at your local video store.  If you want the latter then this will suit you down to the ground.Sadly I expected a sexually charged thriller and was disappointed to find it didn't really deliver.  The first half of the story is good as it feels it is building to something &#150; you know things are not as simple as they seem, but what is behind it all.  The answer to this question is a let down and, worse still, it sparks a final hour of one twist after another &#150; each being more and more silly than the last.  This really spoils it as it isn't clever it just tries to look clever by trying to confuse the audience &#150; the end result is boredom, tiredness and a feeling of really not caring any longer.  After a while the twists become obvious &#150; I began to expect the most absurd thing and in most cases it came true.The sexy stuff is good however but if you want that then why not just rent a soft porn title instead?  The girl-girl stuff and the nudity simply isn't enough reason to watch this although I admit that Richards is gorgeous and it is quite pleasant to see her and Campbell get it on.Dillon leads an impressive cast on paper &#150; but few are allowed to shine.  He himself is quite dull lifeless.  Bacon is clearly a bigger actor that the role appears to need &#150; and hence spoils some of the later twists by his presence. Richards and Campbell are good &#150; but only because they are only needed to look sexy and seductive, something they do well.  Russell and Wagner are wasted and Murray is trapped doing a lazy neck-brace joke for his scenes.Overall this is worth watching once with a pizza and a beer.

To give it antagonistic slant, it might be called 'delighting in death.'Why? For two reasons1) I can cite two credible books on writing supporting the use of violence in stories (particularly those slated for a male audience).2) Show me a dude that doesn't like the gunfight from The Matrix or the 'one versus many' battle between Neo and unlimited Agent Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded, and I'll lose one more potential friend. Or even just the bar fight in The Replacements.I feel the same about sexual content as I do violence.It's strenuous, but I must be even-handed about this movie; this film doesn't deserve its stigma.What stigma?When I told a movie buff pal from college about watching Mulholland Drive, the reply text read 'Second best lesbian scene to Wild Things.'The scene she (thought my friend was male, didn't you?) refers to is when Denise Richards, Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon engage in a steamy threesome.Yes it's fun to watch, but wow it's blown out of proportion.This isn't a pornographic film, Proverbial Audience.Just because she's scantily clad in most scenes, doesn't detract from Richards's performance as Kelly Van Ryan. She's very good in this movie, just like in Starship Troopers.Does Richards lose points for being super hot? She isn't discussed very often.Perhaps partially because Kelly's midriff is bare in almost every outfit. But criticisms proclaiming an excess of skin don't belong in my book.So the movie is very sexualized. Without that tension, I don't believe it's half as enjoyable.What is Body Heat without the sexual tension? How about Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct or Cruel Intentions or anything featuring James Bond?(See those movies if you haven't.)Neve Campbell's acting is very good. She comes off a little strong in the contrarian role. Perhaps it's her liberal use of the 'F-word.'Overall she does a good job with a tough part, though.Kevin Bacon's solid as usual. For most of the movie he's the thoughtful, more reserved Bacon, but towards the end a hint of his character from Diner peeks through.Bill Murray is more reserved as well, doing more 'bare bones' acting than in his usual roles as the funny guy. His character's quietly humorous, but compelling too.Finally, Matt Dillon's fine. I'm afraid he did what he could with a difficult role. Just like Campbell's character, I'm not sure how to improve upon the acting performance. He could use a bit more characterization outside of being the 'handsome and friendly smooth-talker.'The problem is a generalized feeling you get. An awareness you're viewing a movie that's generally accepted as 'good' not 'great,' at its very best.There are some minor details I can name that are more concretely weak. Such as the Van Ryan family's ability to live above the law.But overall, I wish I'd seen this when I was younger and unaware of the famous threesome scene. I'm afraid I would have enjoyed it more without the stigma in mind.The greatest part of this movie is the additional scenes, featured at the beginning of the rolling credits. The shots tie up all loose ends (most of which the audience is unaware of), and twist the story in a few final (and rather satisfying) ways.Overall, Wild Things is very good. It's well made, features an intricate storyline and is just a lot of fun. Plus, it's available for instant streaming via Netflix.Movie fans! If you've been putting it off because you're afraid the quality's 'ungood,' now's the time to watch it.There. You have my permission.Check Wild Things off the list.

The movie is about a high school counselor who is accused for raping to students. There are three main characters in the beginning; Sam Lombardo played by Matt Dillon who is the highs school counselor, Kelly Van Ryan played by Denise Richards as one of the student who is sexy, seductive, rich and popular among students, and Suzie Toller played by Neve Campbell as the student who is poor and with a bad cunning personality. The story starts when Kelly had a crush on Sam and when he turned her down, she and her friend Suzie thought of paying it back with accusing him for rap charges which will ruin his whole career. When the cop, Ray Duquette played by Kevin Bacon, work on the cases, he happened to suspect it as a conspiracy which reviled the whole plan between Sam, Kelly and Suzie. Then only the real story started to unfold. As the story unfolds, the real theme turns out to be greed, betrayal and revenge. In the beginning, the whole thing about rape is plan by Sam, Kelly and Suzie. First Kelly files a case against Sam saying he rape her, in the end trial leaves Kelly's rich and famous family in humiliation and Sam walks out with $8 million as a settlement. The greed for money led Suzie to plane a game on top of both Sam's and Kelly's plans which end up murdering Kelly, Sam and the police officer Ray tactically. The series of Flashbacks from Suzie's memory revels that she did all of this in order to take the revenge from her step sister, who happened to be Kelly's mom for being detested and neglected by their dad. The character of Suzie made all the audience think that the mastermind is Sam and took herself out of the story for a little bit by faking her own death. The feelings of poverty, greed and revenge made her to be the mastermind of the story which surprises the audience in the end. The director, John McNaughton has effectively used thematic elements to make the movie so much interesting and keep the audience guessing what is going to happen in the movie next. The character of Suzie shows the effective use of Irony of Character, that is what made the whole movie interesting. First, Suzie was introduced as a poor and a willful neglected girl which made her underestimated in the story. In the end she turned the whole story upside down by taking the control of it. One of the most important element was flashbacks which revealed the whole part of the theme. Overall, Wild Things (1998) was a great movie filled with suspicion, mystery and crime. The director was able to convey the story effectively throughout the whole movie. With all the effects and techniques, the director of the movie has been able to present a brilliant cinema production.

There are literally about a million plot twists in this film. And they all make sense! How many movies can you say actually make sense when you sit down to really think about what is going on? Not very many, especially when the plot is consistantly twisting.Like in that stupid movie Double Take with Eddie Griffin-- the plot is always twisting.

When there is nudity or sexy scenes in here it has nothing to do with furthering the plot, it was gratuitous nudity.  It was to get men into the audience and holler at the gorgeous women on screen.  And I loved it for that.  There are not that many movies that dare to stoop to that level to sell tickets anymore.  Wild Things does and makes no apologies for it.There are so many plot twists in here that when you are not watching Denise Richards get wet and get into a menage a trois, you are engaged by the story.  And it never stops moving.  It always has something new that you are shocked at just when you think there is nothing more to figure out. Especially entertaining in this film is Bill Murray as a sleazy attorney and his secretary.  She had me in stitches at times.  Especially bad is Theresa Russell.  I have never thought of her as a good actress and I think she got by on nepotism for her whole career.  Here she whines and has no idea how to play her part.  I really can't believe that they didn't try to replace her with another actress.  But if you can stomach her for the brief time that she is on screen then you should enjoy the rest of this film.The very end of the film was a shocker to me.  Don't turn the VCR off until the credits have completely stopped rolling.  Here you will see some of the best stuff in the film and it will explain to you alot of what it is that you need to know.Wild Things is a great film, more so for guys for obvious reasons but even for women who like a good story, this will please you as well.It's not often that a film will blatantly use sex to sell their film, it seems like the glory days of the 80's are gone.

It's actually pretty amusing. It follows in the train of such hits as Basic Instinct, The Mean Season, Masquerade, Fatal Passion, or whatever. Everything is parodied. The score slyly chuckles as it traces the contours of Bernard Hermann's masterful theme in Vertigo, shamelessly ripping off the ostinato. The plot rests on a kind of pretzel logic in which everybody is in cahoots with somebody else. It's too complicated to describe. But let's say that Matt Dillon is a proletarian guidance counselor at an elite Florida high school. He teams up with two luscious babes -- Denise Richards of the unending bosoms and Neve Campbell as her friend. The two gals are bisexual and are getting it on with each other as well was with Matt Dillon and the local detective, Kevin Bacon. Dillon and the succulent babes have a false rape charge brought against him, Dillon, and afterwards they sue the rear ends of Richards' mother and her husband, Teresa Russell and Robert Wagner. Much duplicity follows and multiple murders. All is not explained until the end credits roll. I told you it was complicated.I don't think it's worth commenting on the acting since it's all a joke anyway. If you doubt that it's a joke, consider this scene. Dillon and Richards have apparently murdered Campbell, wrapped her body in a shower curtain or a plastic tarp, and bundle the remains into the rear of an SUV. The two killers climb into the front seats. There is a pause. Then Richards says, My mother would kill me if she knew I took the Rover. The funniest part is just about over by the time Bill Murray, as a shabby storefront lawyer, disappears from the plot. Here's how we first meet Murray. At the point where Dillon is charged with rape and about to be hauled into court, he seeks out Murray, who is seated behind his desk wearing a neck brace. Dillon sits down and begins to spill his sad tale but interrupts himself to ask, What IS that thing? Murray says, Oh, this is nothing. I can take it off any time I want. He peeks out the window and mutters, There was this insurance guy around here a while ago. Then he tears off the neck brace, flings it away, and sits back to hear the rest of the story.I'm not sure all the performers knew they were in a comedy. Some are like Margaret Dumont in the Marx Brothers' movies. But the director certainly knows the kind of material he's dealing with. Richards and Campbell have an argument in a swimming pool and while Richards is apparently holding her buddy under water and drowning her, the camera lingers salaciously on Richards' jiggling boobs. It's a magnificent display of bad taste. If the camera had a neck I would wring it.Robert Wagner is in this, too, along with Kevin Bacon. Let's see. RJ was my supporting player in the unforgettable artistic triumph Windmills of the Gods. Or was it Rage of Angels? I forget. Anyway, that gives me a Kevin Bacon number of one. As for Kevin Bacon, I get a Kevin Bacon number of two.Nice shots of Florida beaches. Man-eating alligators. Sailboats of such dimensions that I couldn't afford the upkeep and neither could you. But, withal, this is a message movie, funny or not. The message is that money buys an opulent existence on a tropical beach with Neve Campbell as a companion. Don't worry. She's a genius, with an IQ of 200, which puts her right up there with John Stuart Mill. To prove it, she remarks that the name of the sailboat is Helios and brings up Medea and Creon and some other high-falutin' Greek. She's sexy too.

I recently rented this film on video to get myself acquainted with it again. Matt Dillon plays a teacher at a Florida prep school where he is wrongly accused of raping two of his students.  The plot in this film isn't that simple.  You won't know what will happen from one scene to the next.  The film has mystery, comedy, and erotic moments.  With so many Hitchcockian twists and turns, Wild Things doesn't disappoint.  The 3-way sex scene with Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, & Denise Richards is the best reason to see this film.  Denise Richards was a virtually unknown actress before this film came out.  She shot to stardom after millions of people around the world saw her go topless and share an erotic lesbian kiss with Neve Campbell. Trust me people, this scene is HOT!!!  But there are two disappointments in this film.  The first disappointment is that Neve Campbell doesn't go topless. I've discovered that Neve Campbell has it written in all her film contracts that she never goes nude.  That's a shame.  The second disappointment in this film is that Kevin Bacon does go nude.  Near the end of this film, we get to see Kevin Bacon's.... BACON.... dangle in a shower scene.  I think this was Kevin Bacon's first frontal nude scene ever.  Women may like this scene.  Men may want to look away.  Throughout the film, we find out that everybody are not as they seem to be as the characters are being betrayed left and right.... and killed off one-by-one.  I thought the cast members did some fine acting.... except for Matt Dillon.  I thought Matt Dillon was stiff and dull in his performance.  I thought Neve Campbell and Denise Richards were beautiful and gave decent performances with what they could with the B-movie dialogue that was written.  Bill Murray gave a very funny comedic performance as Matt Dillon's defense lawyer.  Kevin Bacon, as always, gave the best performance in this movie.  Wild Things isn't the best movie ever made, but the plot twists and the 3-way sex scene makes this film a fun ride to take.  This will forever be a classic!  Great Film Noir!

Well, I don't think it will be the story, because there are so many twists in it that it is almost impossible to keep following it. The only other reason I can come up with to watch this movie must be the many erotic scenes (Richards and Campbell kissing in the pool and in a car, a threesome between Campbell, Richards and Damon,...). Wild Things is about Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), a rich snob, who accuses the school guidance counselor, Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) of raping her. The police starts an investigation and they soon find another victim. Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) is a poor, drug using girl that lives in a trailer. She attends the same school and she claims to be raped by Lombardo as well. However, during the trial she appears to be lying. She admits that it is just a trick to punish Mr. Lombardo because he has let her down once and that Van Ryan is in it as well. So far so good, but then the movie starts to twist and turn so often that it makes it very hard to keep understanding what is actually happening. All the good people appear to be bad; the victims are in a conspiracy with the criminal, but so are many other people; murders are being committed like if it is nothing... It's just one huge mess. I guess the only reason why people keep watching until the end is because they are expecting even more steaming sex scenes. All in all it was a very promising movie, but the many twists just made it too complicated and unbelievable. On the other hand, I'm only a man with a healthy dose of hormones...

It isn't great on any kind of level . Still , it provides a quite decent entertainment for nearly 2 hours. It's better than most of the movies in its genre - erotic thriller (not that the genre has about 2 really good movies in it , while the rest is basically a straight-to-video/DVD crap.The best thing about Wild things is sex. We have three hot ladies here &#x96; Denise Richards , Neve Campbell and Theresa Russell . Not that the men are ugly , hell no , after all we have here Kevin Bacon and Matt Dillon. I can assure you that at some point in the movie you will see everyone of them in some state of undress. WD also has some great sex scenes &#x96; the lesbian scene at the pool and great threesome between two ladies and one man . The threesome is one of my favorite and most arousing movie scenes EVER.The screenplay by Stephen Peters isn't exactly a brilliant one . It feels like a story from one of those pulp magazines that inspired Quentin Tarantino to make Pulp fiction. I was able to figure out most of the twists and connections between characters before the movie presented them to the audience . Yet there was some inspired stuff here &#x96; the teeth , the lovely behind the scenes ending credits and Bill Murray's part in the story (!).John McNaughton directs the sex scenes very nicely . Atmospheric score by George S. Clinton certainly helps him. On the other hand he tries to hide the surprises from the audience in a too obvious way &#x96; for example if you didn't saw Dillon raping Richards or the fight between Bacon and Richards it means that the truth is completely different than what movie is trying to suggest you.Denise Richards is watchable here . Her body does most of the acting . Neve Campbell is really solid as the naughty girl , same as Kevin Bacon as FBI agent. Matt Dillon isn't bad , but the way he acts makes it obvious for the audience that he isn't exactly a good guy as the movie tries to present him . Theresa Russell is quite good as the rich and powerful Sandra Van Ryan. I was surprised by Bill Murray who gives a very funny performance as the tricky lawyer.It's obviously the best movie of the franchise . Not really a quality movie , but if you will low your expectations you probably will have fun with this popcorn thriller. I give it 5/10.

Back then I only cared about horror films like SCREAM, and this sleazy-looking thriller didn't have what it took to whet my appetite back then. Fourteen years later my tastes have broadened a great deal, so I decided to check it out.WILD THINGS turns out to be a real thrill-ride of a film, and that's all down to Stephen Peters' script, which is tremendous. It packs more genuinely surprising twists into its running time than half a dozen other Hollywood thrillers, and you can never predict where it's about to go next.An ensemble cast of actors known for appearances in sometimes-trashy cinema adds to the appeal. Matt Dillon does well balancing a difficult leading role, and Kevin Bacon has fun as a hard-ass cop, riffing on a role he must have played dozens of times during his career. Denise Richards, too, appears to be having a good time, trading on her cheerleader looks to decent effect, though Neve Campbell can't seem to shift her SCREAM-style goody two-shoes persona.Watch out for decent production values, slick direction from John McNaughton (HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER) and a wicked supporting role for Bill Murray.

Mostly, they plan, plot, manipulate, lie, steal, cheat, and kill. All are consumed by and driven by greed. That's number one, But some are driven by revenge, sex, jealousy and even love.It's only a question of which is lowest and cleverest among them and will beat the others.Important parts of the back story aren't shown visually until after the credits start rolling. Be sure to watch until the end to confirm information that is provided verbally and in prior developments. That is, if you care to understand fully what you have just seen of the complex interactions of these sociopaths and psychopaths.There is a kind of justice to it all since all but 2 of them end up dead.The 5 characters are played by Bill Murray (a sleazy lawyer), Kevin Bacon (corrupt cop), Matt Dillon (corrupt high school counselor), Neve Campbell (supposedly punk teenager but highly intelligent), and Denise Richards (sexy daughter of very wealthy Theresa Russell).At times the material is treated with some humor, but at the midway point you know that a major twist lies just ahead. These kinds of twists are losing their surprise value because they've been used so much, so one way to create entertainment for a sophisticated audience is to multiply them while maintaining plausibility. That's what's done here.The only decent character with much screen time appears to be Bacon's partner, played by Daphne Rubin-Vega, but her character is almost nothing but a convenience to the transmission of the plot.The movie more or less succeeds at what it does by not going too deeply into the characters, although we cannot take the outcome seriously. If it made them into really real people, we'd reject this confluence of psychopaths and their actions as implausible. The actors have to make us believe in their actions, and they do, while remaining somewhat as superficial. The most depth and reality is accorded to Denise Richards, whose emotions are the most genuine. This means that she is among the more manipulated. Kevin Bacon manipulates and is manipulated. He seems to be stuck on Matt Dillon, and Denise Richards surely is. Dillon is stuck on himself.Neo-noir is getting old. It's getting harder to be original. This story is basically formulaic, but it injects novelty via its complexity, to some extent by its setting, by its emphasis on sex, and by treating its material with some humor and lightness at times. It ends up working.

Both are steamy, pulpy thrillers filled with sex, violence and diabolical schemes. But while Basic Instinct succeeds in its ambitions, Wild Things doesn't.Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) is the much beloved guidance counselor at a Florida high school. But two students, rich kid Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards) and self-proclaimed white trash Suzy Toller (Neve Campbell) accuse Lombardo of rape. But did he do it, or is something more devious afoot?There are two big problems with Wild Things the script and the direction. This kind of thriller needs two things, and in as much amounts as possible atmosphere and sleaze. Unfortunately, director John McNaughton makes the mistake of misunderstanding the material. He knows it's supposed to be pulpy, but he presents the mood with subtlety. This is precisely the wrong thing to do with this kind of story. Furthermore, when the first big twist comes, McNaughton doesn't know how to handle the material anymore, and he becomes unsure of how to proceed. The result is an unconvincing second half. Finally, McNaughton does not know how to pan a camera. When the camera moves, it is done so badly that it's jarring.The script's deficiencies would not be so noticeable if McNaughton's direction had been better (at least until the end). As such, they are emphasized. The story works great until the final 20 minutes, when it really falls apart. Writer Stephen Peters is so determined to bend the story over itself again and again that it ceases to make sense.The acting is okay. Matt Dillon fares the best as Lambardo. Denise Richards is less effective as Kelly, then Neve Campbell comes in third. Kevin Bacon is flat, and Bill Murray is miscast. No one else has much to do.Wild Things wants to be a good potboiler, but it doesn't have the guts to get down and dirty.

It got the word commercial all over it ! Actually this movie is candid to a respectable extent. Explicitly they write the word SEX on the board at the first scene. It's not discussing a problem or making a serious statement about a case , it's the human greed , instinct , impurity as wild things ..And that's it ! I told you earlier it's a wild deal which well-done also. However it's not all brainless ..If you try to philosophize it ..They gave you chances  we're living a rotten world where the instinct's needs rule , the society's values became lower and lower since the investigators as well as the defenders of the truth (the officer , and the lawyer) are investigating and defending money only , there is no perfect truth only detached pieces of it , greed can make the human a wilder beast with evil brain and no mercy.. etc.And if you want to have only a nice time there are more than satisfying point ..I personally preferred the steamy presence of (Theresa Russell) and all of her scenes , she was younger , hotter , more truthful than everybody else ! , plus the smart ending through the closing credits.SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM ANYWAY ?! , what's here to make the critic criticize ? It has something for everyone But.. You might sense some coldness  the sex scene with all due respect wasn't hot by any chance ..It was the worst acting I've ever seen among resembling situations plus a hunch about the 2 actresses as not comfortable at all during this. Generally the performance was fake (Denise Richards and Matt Dillon for examples) , moreover the bad feelings that this movie leaves you with (intentionally or unintentionally) about the illusion of the trust , the permeation of depravity , the end of goodness or at least its weakness. Or maybe the fact about (Denise Richards) and (Neve Campbell) as not sexy enough !, or that (Dillon) didn't deserve any of them !! Or the most shocking truth of all that after (Basic Insect- 1992) crime movies used to hackney as well as degrade their good issues to act immorally , it's wild things through wild ride utilizes its wild elements commercially however not to a very stupid extent which managed to destroy any possible meaning in other similar movies.

(warning i guess them 9.9 times out of 10 but these were to obvious and the legendary scene does a huge damage on this front too).2)To many explanations!!! Dude we are not that dumb and we don't need to know everything, theorising what happens is a lot of fun.What this movie didn't have enough of was Denise Richards she was way too hot and even though i didn't watch it I would recommend you watch the UNRATED version. At least if there were some more sexual tensions in this movie then we could have sexy and entertaining thriller like basic instinct.The acting was surprisingly good not that you expect much from such a film but there are a few fine actors in this movie and they have done a good job.P.S Both the women look anything but 18 the age they are supposed to play also Matt Dillon looks out of place the casting was not the best but no ones complaining.I kind of liked the background score as and when it was used it was one of the saving graces in this otherwise ordinary movie.All said and done this movie is not that bad a package provided you watch the unrated version, are really bored, wish to know how and where they fit in the legendary scene and love watching a movie and guessing the twists.More like a last choice but watchable nonetheless remember to rent the UNRATED version though.

Cain or Jim Thompson. They also seemed to be trying to mix in some of the arch wit and cynicism of an Alfred Hitchcock movie or a Lawrence Block Burglar novel. However, they pretty much missed the mark with the last objective, and the first two have already been done quite well by films such as 'Body Heat' and 'Miami Blues', so 'Wild Things' ends up looking a bit shabby by comparison.The problem is the nature of the story material. Noir thrillers always have two overriding themese 1) People (Especially Women) Are No Damned Good (CRIME) and 2) Instant Karma's Gonna Get Ya Every Time (PUNISHMENT). A noir movie has to incorporate these two themes in new and unpredictable ways, and Wild Things simply thrashes around too much in an attempt to do something new while it moves from the CRIME theme to the PUNISHMENT. Trying not to be derivative, the story ends up exhausting the viewer's patience. A master plotter like Loren Estleman could have streamlined this puppy and simplified it while preserving the 'wheels with wheels' factor going, but the screenplay here just doesn't know when to say 'WHEN'. And there's the matter of taste and restraint, of which 'Wild Things' has none. Keep in mind that Cain and Thompson had plenty of sleazy, trashy, sociopath characters in their books, and it took considerable care and taste to bring their plots to a movie without overloading the Sleaze Meter and making the viewer loathe and despise everybody in the story. But somewhere in the process of making this film, the director lost control and let the whole thing lurch over into I Hate Every Major Character In This Film territory. I think I hit my gag limit with the totally gratuitous nude shower shot of Kevin Bacon. It didn't add a thing to the story, and was obviously just there to expose yet another acre of flesh to the camera. All of my quibbles with this film are really with the screenplay. I think the actors are all high level pros who do what they do really well...it's just that the movie requires them to play repellent characters. And boy, are they repellent! In defense of Denise Richards, no she can't act, but she never really is given a chance to act, in this film or most others. Film makers just use her as a Barbie Doll with nice boobs and striking eyebrows - kind of like the 2nd coming of Brooke Shields. That is again the case here. I think that it is still possible that Richards could go the route of Jennifer Connelly and eventually do credit to some 'real' actresses roles...If she is ever given the chance.And the movie LOOKS great. Wonderful scenery, lighting, camera work and production values. However, when you have to use this as a defense for a movie's quality, you are basically admitting that the problems with acting or direction or storyline are insupportable. I am not saying you shouldn't see this movie...you just have to be in the right mood to enjoy it. If I had to described the internal criteria a viewer needed in order to enjoy this movie, he or she would be saying to them self I'd like to watch something like 'Body Heat', or The Postman Always Rings Twice, but it doesn't have to be as good.
