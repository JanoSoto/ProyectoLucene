In a fun and entertaining way, the filmmakers displayed the true lesson of the team  if you have a dream, go after it, no matter what anyone else says.This isn't the greatest film ever and it's full of cliches; but, they work.  If you can't get caught up in the emotion and excitement of the film, it's because your heart is frozen.  There are plenty of laughs and general silliness, but there is also good drama and fine performances.  John Candy showed he could deliver an emotional performance instead of just schtick.  During the bobsled runs, you can't help but find yourself cheering for the team.This film is a pleasure to watch and will bring a smile to your face.  Is it good?  Yeah, mon!

It's only sad point is to be reminded of what a loss we movie lovers suffered with the death of John Candy. Imagine what he could have done with a little more time on this mortal coil. This movie is uplifting; it's about the human spirit, its strengths and weaknesses. It explores the parent-child conflict, superstition, ambition, love, hate, patriotism and a gamut of other themes. The story telling is good, the camaraderie authentic, and the celebration of life inspiring. Follow your dreams, wherever they may lead you.

(There are only 2.6 million people in Jamaica - so I know you don't account for a large percentage of the English-speaking world.)  Hands up all those people with any interest at all in bobsledding.  Hah!  I knew it!  No-one.That's why `Cool Runnings' succeeds.  It depends not at all on aggressive nationalism (it couldn't afford to, with a constituency of 2.6 million), and people of all countries are free to participate in the Jamaicans' perfectly reasonable patriotism.  (Probably even the Swiss, whose bobsled team comes across as more than a trifle arrogant.)  Nor is there any of that worship of a particular sport that makes baseball movies so unendurable for people outside of North America, Cuba and Japan.  (Not that I have any evidence that baseball movies are popular in Cuba or Japan.)There isn't any power-of-positive-thinking psychobabble, either - at least, it doesn't dominate.  The four Jamaican bobsledders are separate people with different goals and ways of thinking.  The coach (played beautifully by John Candy, who proves that he can act without playing the clown) doesn't ram a particular ideology down his players' throats.  I doubt that any sports film has a more civilised and reasonable coach.It comes down to this we are given a reason to care about the characters, unrelated to nationality; and we are given a story that's worth following, even if we would never follow the sport itself.  The clich√©s are fewer than usual and never offensive.  It's a sweet film, and I doubt there's more than a handfull of people who could resist its charm.

Cool Runnings tackles all of these themes head-on without losing an ounce of its charm, humour, or family-fun.A superbly played Joseph Gruel is the prime embodiment of the racism the Jamaicans face on the hill, and his story is very moving. So too is the voyage of self-discovery and forgiveness embarked on by disgraced coach Erv Blitzer (John Candy). The team themselves are a wonderful advert for teamwork and the little island of Jamaica. Each one is wise, bold in the face of their respective adversity, and has an intriguing story to tell.The ending of Cool Runnings also ranks as one of the greatest. It masterfully avoids the back-slapping, one-dimensional and predictable ending it looks to be approaching, a trap that so many other similar 'feel-good' films fall into. Instead Cool Runnings brings together all of the themes that have been explored, in one emotionally charged final scene.99% will disagree with something I have written above. But I first watched the film 15 years ago and it has stayed with me ever since. I have watched it around 100 times now, and I still shed a tear at the end...no other film has ever brought me even close to that.If you take nothing else from this review. Watch Cool Runnings. It is so much better than the clever-arsed, blockbuster-biased critics will have you believe. Forget the highly forgettable cheese like Remember the Titans, The Mighty Ducks and all the rest. Pull up a chair, get the phone on divert, and sit back and enjoy the only 'feel good' film worth watching.

That ending is genuinely inspirational, lump-in-the-throat stuff, which so many serious sports movies have aimed at, and fallen short of.Most miraculously, from my point of view, I actually found myself _liking_ John Candy, in this movie.

Off the top of my head, I can name The Air Up There, Iron Will, and the Mighty Ducks in this category as well. They weren't masterpieces, per se, but they were pleasant, fun, and sometimes inspirational. The thing about a sports movie is that the passion that a dedicated athlete feels is usually something that can translate itself visually on screen. For instance, if you were to make a movie about a passionate chess player, it's not as exciting to watch the final climactic moment when the hero checkmates his opponent, as it is to watch a game winning shot. What I'm getting to is that one of the draws of a sports movie is being exposed to that passion and desire in our hero. In this case, the hero is Jamaican sprinter Derice Bannock who was accidentally tripped during the Olympic trials, but is determined to make the Olympics anyway. Since track's no longer an option for him, he figures why not start the nation's first bobsledding team, since a bobsled team hasn't been fielded yet. He also is encouraged in the sport by the fact that a friend of his dad happens to be a bobsled coach and he might be able to help. The bobsled coach declines citing as his reasons that there's no ice in Jamaica, that there's not enough time to train, that Derice doesn't have 3 other people which is needed to form a team, that he doesn't even think Derice was a good runner, and that he doesn't even like coaching anymore.Nevertheless, Derice manages to convince the coach, and get three teammates consisting of his best friend, the guy who tripped him in the trials, and another sprinter who got tripped in the trials along with him. This is one of the better sources of entertainment in the film because the dynamics of this team are formed under such unusual circumstance. For instance, Yul, one of the two who got tripped during the trials, still hasn't forgiven Junior, the tripper.The film very cleverly finds a balance between the inspirational element of this story and the humor. Essentially, Derice the most determined member of the group, is a person who we come to admire for his persistence, and maybe that's why it's a good family film, someone kids can look up to. The humor comes from Derice's friend, Sanka, who says a lot of funny stuff. This really is the only way the movie could work because if Derice was funny and told jokes, you wouldn't take him seriously, and if Sanka was more determined about winning, his jokes would sound out of context. The two guys in the middle of the bobsled, both metaphorically and literally, add to the film in their own ways but on a smaller scale. The late John Candy plays the coach and fills the part well. The other notable thing about the film is it's ending. Provided, this is your first viewing, it really does a lot for the movie. I won't give it away, but the ending is unpredictable yet equally satisfying, something I don't often see. However, I wonder, since this was filmed only five years after the Calgary Olympics, how familiar would viewers have been with the actual event that inspired the film. If they knew the story of the '88 Jamaican bobsled team in its entirety, than the impact of that ending would have been lost.

And since this is a comedy and not a documentary, that's all I'm asking of this movie.If you hope to see a documentary on how the first Jamaican bobsled team was created and how they got to the Olympics than you'll have to look for something else. This movie has been inspired on the true events, but never pretends to be faithful to the truth. Does that mean that this movie isn't any good? No, certainly not. I loved to see how these four guys were transfered from sprinters to bobsledders and I couldn't help laughing all the time when seeing their reactions on, for instance, the cold and the snow.This isn't the greatest movie ever and yes it is full of clich√©s, but they all work and it never bothered me once. However, don't expect to see a ridiculous comedy with no content either, because it still has a good story and plenty of emotions and excitement to offer. I reward this movie with an 8/10.

The story, about a group of Jamaican athletes who were prevented from competing as runners and so sought a different (!) venue in order to participate, has many funny moments. The late John Candy, of whom I am no fan, is very good here; his role as the coach with a checkered past calls for some real dramatic work as well as comedy. The team is a very likeable bunch (with varying acting abilities) and the viewer is rooting for them all the way as they demonstrate great courage in snatching their own kind of victory from the jaws of defeat; the ending is a real lump-in-the-throater.Good flick, but a caveat for viewing with the kiddos - the language is a tad rough in a couple of spots.

I must admit, I didn't know previous to seeing the movie that Candy was an expert on bobsleding, although I can easily see why his severe obesity would allow him to be good at sitting on a sled and traveling down an ice covered path at an incredible speed.  Candy should have just had Doug E. Doug hang out with him for a year and put him on the same diet.  Plus, you got to figure with all the pot Mr. Doug was smoking he would have the munchies constantly. Now, Cool Runnings had all the makings of the greatest movie of all time.  It had an Oscar winning cast, Jack Nicholson, DeNio, Pacino, Helen Hunt, Vin Diesel etc., it had beautiful settings and costume design, a great musical score with such hits as here is something you can't believe, Jamaica, we have a bobsled team... and a great director in someone who I don't know.

But bobsledding is about more than technique - it's about belief, friendship and not taking things too seriously.Anybody expecting a serious sports drama had better look elsewhere because Cool Runnings never takes itself seriously. In fact, the greatest compliment I can pay it is that for the most part, it never actually feels like a sports movie - mainly due to the comedy which is both funny and well-performed. With Candy being the only actor I recognise, the four leads acquit themselves very well alongside their heavyweight co-star, who seems to be lacking some of the spark that made him so watchable in the likes of Planes, Trains and Automobiles. The story, based on fact, doesn't offer any real surprises as the usual obstacles and hiccups along the way emerge. What this film does have, aside from commendable humour, is a heart to it and a sense that (for once) winning isn't everything.It does look its age in places - the bobsledding scenes are understandably rough around the edges and the day-glo fashions are extremely reminiscent of the early Nineties - but Cool Runnings remains a very watchable effort. It doesn't have any pretences of greatness about it, unlike most other sports films where the big game at the end is literally the biggest thing in the world. Here, they just want to compete and this sits well with the easy-going Jamaican vibe to the film which is undeniably infectious. Despite the snow and ice, the film has a warm, sunny glow to it and while I detest describing anything as heartwarming, Cool Runnings would certainly qualify. Champion!

You don't watch Cool Runnings to find some deep, intellectual meaning, or to grow and develop as a person. If you do, well, you're an idiot.Cool Runnings is aimed purely at giving you a fun ride, and it excels at that. There are plenty of clich√©s, the characters are obvious yet lovable, and the general message is the old-fashioned, much used one of overcoming opposition. However, since when are those things a crime? Cool Runnings may not break new ground in the film world, but what it does it does very well, and if you don't find yourself caught up cheering along the team then I mourn for the death of the child in you.

Pulling together a broken down former medal winner for the US as his coach, two other failed sprinters and a driver in local soapbox derbies, Derice pins his hopes to making it to the Winter Olympics despite the fact he has never seen snow, far less driven a bobsleigh.If you buy the facts of this film as being true rather than based very loosely on truth then you probably will want to buy shares in the moon that I can get you cheap if you drop me an email, however even if you ignore these claims, this is still quite a fun family film from Disney. As such though, it doesn't have a great deal of depth to it and everything is presented in very simple, sentimental terms, from characters down to the plot itself. The story is a simple matter of the underdog coming good (although the manner of them coming good is at least slightly different from the genre clich√©) and along the way people bond, learn lessons and warm the hearts of a nation &#150; it is typical Disney fare and will hold no surprises for anyone. However it is presented with a general good humour and by the end of it I was willing on the team despite myself.The presentation of the Jamaicans is a bit simplistic and patronising as the characters are more cardboard cut outs than people &#150; they play their nationality to the fore while doing very little with the simple characters they have been given other than learning lessons etc along the way. Leon is solid enough in the lead without having a lot of charisma. Lewis is amusing enough and obviously had been studying Charlton from Fresh Prince. Yoba is simple but fun while Doug plays up the ethnic clown in a way that will please some but annoy others. Candy looks a little bored at times but generally buys into the spirit of the film without ever trying too hard.Overall this is an amusing film that is distracting without ever having too much about it to risk becoming good. The lack of characters and interesting narrative was a problem for me but it was mostly covered by the genre standards doing their usual thing to reasonable good effect. A good family sports movie that is amusing but nothing more than that.

It takes intelligence, patience and above all courage.  Vonetta Flowers, a young african-american female track runner failed to qualify for the 2000 Summer Games; somewhat dejected, as chance has it, she happened across a flyer asking for interested candidates for the first ever USA women's bobsled team.  She tried out, less than 2 years later she is an olympic gold medalist!  Chances are exactly what Cool Runnings is all about.Inspired on the actual story, Cool Runnings, tells the tale of the first ever Jamiacan bobsleigh team.  An event that shattered many long held rules of winter sports competition.After pleading to no success to Jamaica's senior Olympic official to be reinstated on the 1988 Jamaican Olympic Track team, after failing to qualify to compete in the 100 meter run, defeated Jamaican sprinter Derice Bannock (Leon, in an above average acting  performance) notices an old photo of his late father (himself a track star) at a Winter Olympics 20 years before. Seeing his chance again and determined to let nothing get in his way, not even Jamaica's utter absence of winter sports programs, Derice decides to try again for Olympic Gold in Bobsledding, using his highpowered running skills as his strategy for winning.  He has little clue about what obstacles he will have to overcome.Assembling a rag-tag team of equally defeated track sprinters, Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) & Jr Bevil (Rawl Lewis), one patriotic loud-mouth push-cart driver, Sanka Coffie (Doug E Doug), and the long displaced and defeated bobsled champion (and former teammate of Derice's father) for a coach, Irv Blitzer (John Candy, in probably his last genuinely terrific performances before his untimely death in 1994), Derice and company make it to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  They make it, despite misgivings from Jamaican Olympic officials who think the whole idea of competing in winter sports is ridiculous and refuse help them in any way.History will always remember that the 1988 Olympic Bobsled compeition was won by the Swiss team, and that the Olympic medal count was dominated by the now defunct USSR and East Germany (USA only won 6 medals that year, Canada only won 5 with no golds).  But a group of black men from a 3rd world carribean island nation, with no winter sports history or experience, come in and made heads turn with their speed and determination despite overwhelming and sometimes laughable odds.Bobsleigh is a 2nd tier-sport that only recieves attention during the Olympics, just like so many other sports, but dreams of Olympic Gold drives atheletes of all races and natinoalities to excellence and fame...even a group of disenchanted Jamaican sprinters (and one pushcart driver).They qualify for the Olympics, and then face an uphill battle just for respect from anyone, including Jr's father (a business men looking out for the best interests of his son). But despite all their determination, this movies namesake, Cool Runnings, which happens to be their thirdrate, handed-down bobsled (beautifully painted in Jamaica's traditional green, black and yellow banner colors) breaks a runner (the sled's skatelike blade) and crashes on their final run just as it would seem they have pulled off the upset victory (this comes after a rickety 1st run which didn't help the ethos of their critics, and a stunning 2nd run).  Shaken and bruised, with no chance at victory, but determined more than ever to at least cross the finish line in spirit and leave their mark, Derice and the others pick up their sled and carry it across the finish to a thunderous applause including previously fickle and nasty competitors and bobsled officials, as well as countrymen back home.All in all, a great family-feel good movie.  It contains plenty of humor, jokes and gags such as Sanka's insistant kissing of his prized  egg as well as the team's initial clumsiness with ice such as the particulary cute moment involving their first-ever sled run on ice. There is also fantastic photography of bobsled racing (some of which is archival footage from the 1988 Olympic Bobsleigh competition). But Cool Runnings most striking feature is that it never loses sight of the aspects of competition, which is the fundamental theme of the Olympics. Jamaica returns to the Olympic scene again, this time as equals.Although the movie hints at social issues many would rather sweep under the rug, such as cheating, racism, and jealosy, Cool Runnings accomplishes what most sports related movies always lose sight of that victory doesn't always come on the playing fields (or in this case the track) but victory comes from friendship and determination just to compete.Check it out!!!

When the Olympics came around, after the first three runs, they were in 7th place going into the last run and then, of course was the famous crash. The biggest moment for the Jamaicans came 6 years later in Lillehammer when the team finished in 14th place, one spot ahead of the first U.S. sled. After Jamaica's success in '88, other warm-weather nations started teams, which include Brazil. I wish Disney could make a sequel based on the Jamaican's success at Lillehammer.

At times, director Jon Turteltaub's film seems almost too good to be true, because it isn't exactly true. While it is based on a true story, the film is heavily fictionalized and most of the characters were created by the scriptwriter. Still, the film is a nice portrait of a quite extraordinary event in sports history.Cool Runnings is the story of a Jamaican runner named Derice (Leon) who wishes to follow in his father's footsteps and run the 100 meter dash at the Olympics. An unfortunate event keeps him from qualifying at the trials, so he hunts down bobsledding coach Irv Blitzer (John Candy) to help him form the first Jamaican bobsled team. After recruiting best friend Sanka (Doug E. Doug) and some fellow Olympic runners (Rawle Lewis and Malik Yoba), the team takes on the Winter Olympics world, including a hard-nosed Olympic Alliance, to prove the world wrong and show that they belong.The film is not extraordinary in any way, but it can make you feel emotions immensely. After watching the film numerous times, I still chuckle at Sanka's little jokes and goofiness, largely because of an eccentric performance from Doug E. Doug. He does some over-the-top acting in a good way, Leon does some over-the-top acting in a not-so- good way. His portrayal of the leader of this squad is a little too forced, but we still believe in him because he is so determined to win. John Candy was an excellent choice to play Irv. He begins as an impolite bookie and turns into quite a brilliant coach who cares about his guys. He even gives a speech to the Alliance that is intense and surprisingly not very clich√©. The film doesn't take any risks in the editing, and has a number of scenes that feel unnecessary, but the story usually covers it up just enough to keep it from being too much of a distraction. It's nice to see a film focus on a country like Jamaica. The accents may be a little overdone at times, and some things might be a little stereotypical, but the culture and reggae soundtrack and score by Hans Zimmer is relieving while enjoying the movie. It's all brought together by no other than Sanka, who at one point reminds Derice of who they are and where they come from. He says, If we walk Jamaican, talk Jamaican, and is Jamaican, then we sure as hell better bobsled Jamaican. This comes after Derice continuously idolizes the Swiss team, and Doug's delivery is perfect and heartfelt.There is a point in the film where the team is huddling up for their final run, and they shout Respect! I love this little bit because it encapsulates the main theme of the film. This story isn't about these guys trying to win the gold or even the silver or bronze. It's about their struggles to gain respect for themselves and for their country. This drive makes the film so riveting and the final scene can send chills down your spine even after watching it for the tenth or fifteenth time. Cool Runnings is not the most outstanding sports film, but it's right up there with Rocky and Hoosiers in terms of having the most heart. It's nearly impossible to not laugh and cheer when watching this story unfold, and there is nothing wrong with that.

"},{"Title":"Plenty of humor with a splash of inspiration.","Date":"20 December 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" This is one of three sports movies that I can easily enjoy, the other two being Happy Gilmore and Moneyball. The main reason it is enjoyable is because it is more of a comedy than anything else. Most sports movies attempt to be inspirational by having an underdog team win the championship against insurmountable odds, usually with some kind of emotional conflict in it (e.g. Remember the Titans, Miracle, Rudy, The Perfect Game, The Express, Brian's Song). While Cool Runnings does feature an underdog team and has some amount of emotion in it, there is a much different feel to it than the aforementioned films. This is likely because it is not base on a true story, or at least very loosely, has no overriding emotional subplot, and has lots of humor mixed in with it. It also helps that the team is good evidently pretty good, but metaphorically crashes and burns due to unfortunate circumstances at the end. However, there is still an air of inspiration to the end sequence as the world recognizes their feats. The main characters are each easy to root for and likable in their own way. Their personalities are well developed and plausible as well as their relationships with each other. Derice and Sanka are friends already, so they obviously have pretty good character chemistry right from the start, though Derice has relatively little personality. Junior gets along well enough with the other four guys by being moderately outgoing. Yul is obviously averse to his teammates, but gradually pushes his emotions and pride aside to relate and collaborate with his teammates while retaining his cold personality. Irv is the only character that I have seen portrayed by John Candy who is not cheerful. However, Candy pulls off being a secluded and sorrowed guy. He does not contribute very much humor to the plot, but is nonetheless a good character. We can clearly see that the team sort of gives him hope, even if he tries to hide it.The sports element of the movie doesn't really kick in until after about forty-five minutes when the team gets to Calgary for the Olympics. Here, the emotional conflict is kicked up a notch in terms of Irv's dispute with the board and Junior standing up to his dad. There are only a few bobsled runs that are shown, and some of them are done for comical purposes. The front-runner Swiss team are kind of put in the villain position here, and we have a couple of encounters between the Jamaican and the Swiss athletes. Apart from that, we see some training scenes throughout.Finally we have the comedy element. The humorous moments come at a pretty constant rate with the same feel to the gags and lines. Some of the humor comes simply because of the absurd idea of a Jamaican bobsled team. Sanka contributes the most laughs out of anyone from his antics on the ice, to his three pump-up songs that he composes throughout, and other various jokes. The one scene that is devoted purely to comedy is the scene where the team tries to raise enough money to get them to Calgary. The technical execution is nothing special, but the acting and scripting is fine for the most part. One could maybe argue that it discriminates against Jamaicans, but I don't know enough about Jamaica to discuss this. The story is not award-winning by any means, but in a movie that is just sort of suppose to be fun, a strong story is not entirely necessary. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a good kid friendly comedy that isn't geared too strongly towards kids. I will caution prospective viewers not to be misguided into thinking this is a stereotypical inspirational sports film, because it isn't. It's not something I would recommend you rush out to buy, but if you happen to come across it, it's worth a try.

Yes, there was a Jamaican bobsled team in 1988 and yes, they did crash. But the rest is a bit of stretch. Their coach was not involved in any scandal for cheating or otherwise. And they were not despised by the other teams, even if the people who made this film wanted to create a white and black bigotry where there was none.Oddly, although anti-racist on the face of it, the film itself may be subtly racist itself. The portrayal of Jamaicans as simple, somewhat backwater people is unfair, and that none of the main actors were actually Jamaican seems unfortunate. We are instead stuck with New Yorkers and exaggerated Jamaican accents.Those criticisms aside, this is still a fun movie and enjoyable for what it is. How can you not help but like a group of misfits who have to face unlikely odds to succeed? This is a tradition in sports movies, and this one has more comedy than the average sports film, making it much more fun for the average viewer.

No problem, man!","Date":"12 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" This underdog sport movie is sure to touch you and lift your spirit. It's nearly a perfect family film. The film is loosely based on a series of true events of the first ever Olympic Jamaican Bobsled Team during the 1988's Calgary Winter Olympic Games. The movie by director Jon Turteltaub takes a lot of creative liberties in the story, recreate a movie infusing enough humor, heart and charm to make this story, very entertaining. The movie tells the story of four Jamaicans athletes, seeking a new way to make their country proud after failing the Olympic tryouts in track & field. All four, find the way in, through an ex-bobsledder named Irving Blitzer (John Candy) whom was banned from the sport, due to cheating. Now, living in shame, in Jamaica, Irving has become an alcoholic has-been. The team enlists his services to be their coach, and soon we find ourselves that maybe Team Jamaica might have a chance to make it to the Olympics, after all. The comedy was funny and enjoyable as each archetype character brings in a lovable trait in that makes it worth watching. First off, there is Derice Bannock (Leon) who dreamt of Olympic grander even if it's takes him losing his Jamaican identify by copying the Swiss team to do it. Then there is Junior Bevil (Rawle Lewis) whom lives under the strict watch of his wealthy father who doesn't wholeheartedly support his Olympic goals as a sub-plot. Third is Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) who lacks a good education but makes up for that with physical strength and macho attitude. He is often mistaken as a thug. Last person in the team is Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) whom may not be the best athlete of the four, but carries the most heart and pride in being Jamaican. The bobsledders portrayed in the film are fictional, but at less, the movie could had more realistic names for the four characters than naming one out of a pot of coffee, and an old Western actor. It's like naming a fast runner, Usain Bolt. Wait a minute, the last one is really his name. Haha. In the film, the team is formed by Jamaican sprinters after failing to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics. In real life, the Jamaican Summer Olympic Trials would have occurred following the Winter Olympics in Calgary. Irving Irv Blitzer is a fictional character as well; the real team had several trainers, none of whom were connected to any cheating scandal. In the sport of bobsledding, adding weight to the sled is perfectly legal. Both two and four-man sleds have minimum and maximum weights. As of this writing, the character of Irving Blitzer did nothing wrong. John Candy is amazing in the role, and it's sad that he died so soon after this movie. The villains of the film, if you can call them 'villains' are the East German team lead by arrogant leader, Josef (Peter Outerbridge) who treat the Jamaicans with serious scrutiny. Like the cartoony Jamaican stereotypes, the East German portrayal in the film are just outlandish racist. The only thing missing is the pencil thin mustaches for them. In real life, the East German team was very supported to the Jamaican bobsled team. There were somewhat true things about the film that worth noting. They did indeed turned up in Calgary without a sled. The nightclub fight didn't happen, but they almost start a riot there, when their singer got carried away and tried to sing a country song during a fund raiser for the sled. They were disqualified by the Olympic committee, but able to gain appeal. It was because the lack of training and whole thing about not having a sled. Not because cheating. Without spoiling too much of the ending, the events that happen are way different than that in real life, but the crash footage was the real life footage shot that day in 1988. The movie is so sport clich√©s that it's predictable to watch. The slow-building standing ovation is an example of this cheese formula. The film's depiction of such bobsledders carrying the sled over the line on their shoulders for dramatic effect works. This film in a masterful way shows that what matters is not always the victory but just being there and participating. Throughout the course of the movie we see the team prove to the world through their persistence that they are just as good as any other team, regardless of where they come from. They learn to become a team, learn to take pride in their culture, and do a lot of self-discovery. Even if the film itself, verges on being a bit mushy. Great morals that children will pick up on. There is some mild use of profanity, and few violent, but for the most part, it's worth watching with your children. The humor works, and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to support the mood of the movie. While the film was made by Americans. I think Jamaicans can find this movie, interesting to watch. Without this film; there wouldn't be much of a Jamaican bobsled program. The Jamaican national bobsled team still represents Jamaica in international bobsledding competitions even today. One of the original bobsled team member even won a Gold Medal in the Olympic in 2006 for Canada. International fans would love it for its Olympic source material, and the use of supporting your culture. So ya mon, it's a good movie!

Doug.This film is loosely based on the true story of the Jamaica national bobsled team's debut in the bobsleigh competition of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Canada.Plot Irving Irv Blitzer was an American bobsled two time Gold Medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics who finished first in two events again during the 1972 Winter Olympics but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to Jamaica, where he leads an impoverished life as a bookie. Irving is approached by two Jamaican athletes top 100m runner Derice Bannock, who failed to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics when another opponent tripped him at the trials, and Sanka Coffie, a champion push cart racer.The athletes wish to use Irving's previous experience as a Coach in order to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics as bobsledders. Irving had been good friends with Derice's father, Ben, a former sprinter whom Irving had tried to recruit for the bobsled team years ago, who is presumed to be deceased. Yul Brenner, another runner who was tripped at the qualifier, joins the team as does as Junior Bevil, the runner who tripped Yul and Derice. Eventually Irving is convinced to coach the team.The four try to find various ways to earn money to get in the Olympics; singing on the street, arm wrestling, and holding a kissing booth, but all fail. Junior, however, sells his car, which gets the team the money that they need.In Calgary, Irving manages to acquire an old practice sled from the American team, as the Jamaicans have never been in an actual bobsled. The Jamaicans are looked down upon by other countries, in particular the East German team whose arrogant leader, Josef, tells them to go home, resulting in a bar fight. The team resolves to view the contest more seriously, continuing to train and improve their technique. They qualify for the finals, but are briefly disqualified. At the primary judge meeting, Irving immediately confronts his former coach from the '72 Olympic Winter Games Kurt Hemphill, now a primary judge of the '88 Olympic Winter Games, for disqualifying the Jamaicans for his mistake. He confesses that he made the biggest mistake in his life by cheating by hiding weights underneath the sled to make it run faster. Irving's 1972 Gold Medals were revoked and he embarrassed his country with the scandal. He says that if Hemphill wants revenge, just punish him, not his team. He begs Hemphill to let the Jamaicans qualify and represent their country in the Olympics. Later, the judges overturn their decision and the Jamaicans are back in.The Jamaicans' first day on the track results in more embarrassment and a last place finish. Sanka convinces Derice to stop copying qualities of the Swiss team. Once the team develops their own style, the second day proves better; the Jamaican team finishes with a fast time which puts them in eighth position. Later, Irving tells Derice the truth about his past and convinces him to think of himself as a champion even if he doesn't win the gold, saying, A gold medal is nice, but if you're not enough without one, you'll never be enough with one. For the first half of the final day's race it looks as though they will break the world bobsled speed record, until tragedy strikes their sled, due to one of the blades falling off, flips on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run, leaving them meters short of the finish line. However, the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish line to rousing applause from spectators, including Josef, Hempill, and Junior's father. The team, at the end, feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states the team returned to Jamaica as heroes and upon their return to the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals.Completely unlike the story in the film, the Jamaican team was not in conflict with any of the other international bobsledding teams. Other teams were, in fact, supportive of the Jamaican team. One of the other teams even lent the Jamaican team a backup sled so they could qualify.The bobsled competition in the film consists of three individual runs, whereas in reality the Olympic bobsled competition is two runs a day held over a two day period.In the film, the Jamaicans are on world record pace during the final run of the competition when their sled crashes. They emerge from the sled and carry it across the finish line. In real life, however, the crash occurred before the finals (eliminating the Jamaicans) and Jamaica was not on a world record pace. However, real-life footage of the crash was used in the film. After the crash, the team walked next to their sled as track officials slid it down the track. They received sporadic applause, but not a rhythmic slow clap as in the movie Verdict A MUST BUY FILM THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY.

Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, etc.Irving Blitzer (John Candy) disgraced himself when putting extra weights into his team's bob in the Olympics, resulting in his gold medal being taken away from him. Years later, Derice Bannock, son to a former friend of Irv, fails to qualify for the 100-yard sprint for the Olympics due to a stupid accident. But when he hears of Irving Blitzer living also on Jamaica, Derice decides to go to the Games anyway. If not as a sprinter, then as a bobsledder. After some starting problems, the first Jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for Calgary. In the freezing weather Derice, Sanka, Junior and Yul are only laughed at, since nobody can take a Jamaican bobsledding team led by a disgraced trainer for serious. But team spirit and a healthy self confidence may lead to a few surprises in the upcoming Winter Games.This is one heck of a funny movie that I've seen in years.But too bad that John Candy passed away a year later after this is made, his official last movie for him was Wagon's East, but he did Canadian Bacon before that, but it came out in 1995.This is another movie you should see, you'll laugh like crazy.Cool Runnings gets 10 stars.

It has a fantastic story that is loosely based on a true story. The acting is great and the characters are hilarious. I especially like that fact that the team doesn't win in the end. This makes the movie a lot more meaningful and a lot less cheesy that it would be if they won. Sanka (Doug E. Doug) is probably my favorite character from any movie. He is hilarious and keeps the movie funny all the way to the end. It is simply a feel good movie and no more than that. If you haven't already seen it i would highly recommend it to anyone, old or young. It just came out on DVD and is selling for cheap on EBAY so there is no reason for you not to have this movie.

It is the story of the first ever Jamaican bobsled team. Derice, a spurned Olympic runner, joins up with 3 other Jamaicans and a washed up bobsledder from the states to try and make it in the Calgary Olympics. The team chemistry finally gels and becomes a medal threat. The happy ending, however, is not for them as they crash on their final run. While this film is a little hokey in parts, which is to be expected because of its Disney roots, it actually makes a case for it to be taken seriously as a movie. The movie is a good mix of funny instances featuring actors John Candy (Irving Blitzer) and Doug E. Doug (Sanka) as well as serious, with the determination of Derice (Leon) driving the film. Even when watching this movie after the initial viewing, I still am caught up in the moment and wish, for once, the team to make it through and win the event. Sadly, however, Disney restrains itself from its typical Cinderella ending to depict the actual crash in the Calgary Olympics. This movie is light enough for casual watching but deep enough to actually entice people to sit and watch over and over.

It can become overly clich√© at times, and the story itself is the typical underdog story, but the origin is much different. The comedy really captures how much of a joke the idea of Jamaican bobsled team was in 1988. Even if they crash at the end, they are able to win the respect of the fans. There are a lot of great shots used in this film, but the extreme close up was used so many times that a couple of the races looked like they were just repeats.If you have seen Remember the Titans, then you will recognize the treatment that Disney gives to a true sports story. Even serious matters are turned into comedic events. The music attached the numerous montages is very uplifiting, and there is never a dull moment in this movie. Dialogue is as long as it needs to be to get a point across and not any longer. John Candy does a great job as the coach, conveying the emotion a former Olympian turned traitor would experience having to come back to a sport where he is not very popular.Great movie for any age, something that can really be watched over and over again.

It's a great movie full of life and light hearted humor. After all these years its still funny and the wise cracking Sangka still makes me laugh. It's a movie full of good messages and morals. This movies is also inspirational at certain key moments, which gives reward to human qualities, like belief in yourself and others and determination. Having said that at times it is a bit dull but all in all its not too bad.You know there are some people who can not believe Jamaica has a bobsled team! Respect to Mr. Blitzer!

Being all you can be is good. Make the characters thin (figuratively) and endearing. Build the whole thing around sweeping music. Disney has the best music shop in the business, especially for telling us what to think and when. Turn the crank.In so turning, emphasize the opinions of others as the key plot device. The climax should take place with a crowd you have won over.This is worse than a waste of time. This can damage your ability to critically think when you encounter a real film. I don't say that often with film (always with TeeVee). But this one is particularly pernicious and subtly patronizing.Ted's evaluation 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

So obvious it hurts, as in conflict between rebellious rich kid and his dad, weak man and bully, bob sled teams from other countries are rude and mean to the fun-loving Jamaicans, etc.  John Candy, in one of his last roles, looks and acts tired.  There is no creativity in the script or story, and the acting is weak and characterizations too stereo typical.  If you're age 10 or younger, you might enjoy it, else don't bother.
