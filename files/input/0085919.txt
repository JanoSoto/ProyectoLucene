[{"Title":"A Minor Neil Simon Classic","Date":"17 January 2006","Score":"11 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" MAX DUGAN RETURNS is a lightweight comedy from Neil Simon about a widowed schoolteacher (Marsha Mason) with a young son (Matthew Broderick, in his film debut), struggling to make ends meet, who one night is reunited with her estranged father (Jason Robards), who shows up on her doorstep wanting to make up for lost time with $687,000.00 in tow. Mason is reluctant to get involved with Dad because the money is not really his but when she learns that he is dying, she softens and decides to grant his dying wish...to spend some of his final time on earth with his grandson. Throw into the mix a police detective (Donald Sutherland) who, upon finding out who Max is, is definitely torn between getting his man and or getting the girl. This comedy charms from start to finish with a lot of classic Neil Simon one-liners and Robards turns in one of his most charming performances as Max Dugan. Yes, there are plot points that are left dangling and you just have to accept that, but if you can, MAX DUGAN RETURNS is a delightful and diverting comedy that will grown on you with multiple viewings.

She has often played mothers, but Mason's relationship here with screen-son Matthew Broderick is extremely warm and real--it lives beyond the wisecracks--and as a daughter to Jason Robards she's funny and occasionally maternal. Plot about an L.A.-area teacher struggling to keep ahead of the bill collector has a jaunty, lively rhythm and a vitality that puts it above most family comedies. When the teacher gets a visit from her long-lost father, carrying a satchel of stolen money, the story thickens but doesn't bubble over. Director Herbert Ross does a good job at keeping the situation grounded. Donald Sutherland is perhaps an odd casting choice as the detective/love-interest investigating Pop (Sutherland has played so many heavies, he still has an evil glint in his eyes and an edge in his voice), however he makes the character right for him. Credit Neil Simon with one of his best scripts; he has no agenda here except to make us laugh, though that presents a problem when reality sinks in and daughter and dad have to deal with the moral (and legal) ramifications of the money. There are some quick lines at the finale designed to make the ending a happy one, but I'm not so sure Mason would be in the clear after the police become involved--nor would her romance with Sutherland be quite so rosy once he has to choose the law over his feelings for her. And why does Mason say he's going to drive at the finale when the car turns into an animated plane? Would Pop ditch the car at the airport? And what about that lunch date at Pizza Hut? When Mason and Broderick show up in a taxi, wouldn't detective Sutherland be a little bit suspicious? *** from **** "},{"Title":"Simon's best original film script with stellar cast in top form.","Date":"23 May 2000","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  For me this is Neil Simon's best original film script. It is warm, engaging, fun and both humorous and believable.  It is also for me Marsha Mason's best comedy performance - as opposed to her fate in most of her films she has generous actors around her with whom the give and take is regenerative.  Her Nora is a harried teacher and single mother, trying to make ends meet and not having a good week, when her long lost father (who walked out on the family when she was nine) arrives out of nowhere with a suitcase full of money.  Watching Miss Mason interact with veteran Jason Robards, professional Donald Sutherland, and newcomer Matthew Broderick (in his first film role) is wonderful. Her Nora is completely believable and completely adorable.   It is one of her triumphs and the film matches her in quality all the way.   A gem for the entire family.

"},{"Title":"the old fashion funny movie","Date":"11 February 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  I watched a movie called Max Dugan Returns,.  This movie was a little bit different than other movies that I've watched.  Jason Robards performed in that movie.  He was a very funny man.  Neil Simon wrote the story and his wife, Marsha Mason was in there too. I knew that Neil Simon a funny play writer, but I had never seen one of his plays or movies.  When I finished watching the movie, I realized that he is a really funny writer. One thing that I couldn't find in his story about Max Dugan Returns, is that there is no sadness in his story when he makes funny plays. I think what Neil Simon is trying to tell us about is, we have to be on our family's side no matter what.  In this movie Nora protected Max from the cops until Max is safe.  And that tells us, that we have to help our family. Jason Robards was a very nice and funny man.  When he went  to Nora's house, he gave gifts to Michael and Nora.  Like a Benz, TV, dog, a new house, and other stuff.  Yet he lied too much.  He lied until Nora tells the truth to his son.  I think he shouldn't lie that much. I think Marsha Mason was the funniest actress in that movie.  I liked way she talked to people, and way she acts.  I liked her reaction when she lost her car, bike and the Benz.  She was so funny. And she was good mother too. Donald Satherland was cop and Nora's boy friend.  He used to hang out with her a lot, but when he found that Max was a suspect, he forgets about Nora and catching Max. Mathew Broderick Nora and Nora's son Michael.  He was a high school baseball player.  He wasn't good, but he learned from a Chicago White Sox hitter coach. I think this film's grade is about 6 because this movie wasn't my type of movie.  I like action or thrillers.  I don't like this kind of movie, but the characters did good job so I'm going to give them a 6. This movie was about family, friends, and love.  We have to help our family when they need help, and we have help our friends when they need help.  the most important thing is that we have to love each other.

I did and I liked it.  Even though it is an old movie to me it seems pretty funny.  I love funny movies.  So I think that if you should see it because I'm sure that you'll like it.  I mean, who would not like to see a movie written by Neil Simon?The movie was interesting most of the time.  It was hilarious how Nora McPhee got her cars stolen.  Every time that Marsha Mason, who played Nora McPhee, opens her mouth you could say that there is something funny coming. But like all the movies there were some good and bad things.  One of them was that I didn't like the way Donald Sutherland, the policeman, was so demanding and always putting so much pressure on Nora McPhee.There was an honesty problem in the movie.  Since Max Dugan, who was played by Jason Robards, came back to his daughter's house he said that he was her father's friend, which it is not true.  Another thing is that he said that he was going to stop giving them stuff but he didn't stop and kept buying presents for them.Jason Robards, a 1999 Kennedy Center Honoree, played Max Dugan in this movie.  He did a good job.  He performed like if he was doing all that in real life.  It was a good performance.  He knew how to work the cigar in his mouth. There is nothing I have to complain about except the fact that he did some illegal things to make her daughter and his grandson happy.Marsha Mason was great.  Marsha as Nora ws very funny and the fact that she had bad luck during throughout the movie it makes her to be a better character.  She acts like a good, caring and loving mother.  Always working hard to survive.Donald Sutherland came into Nora's life to change everything that could happen in her future.  He changes her life in good and bad things.  More bad things than good ones. The only good one was that he gave her his love, his very sincere love.In a score of 1- 10 I give this movie an 8 because it made me laugh and I really would like to see it again.  It was pretty good to be an old movie. I usually don't like old movies.If you haven't seen it I hope that you'll rent it.  That's about it, Max Dugan Returns.

Grandfather (Max Dugan) played by Jason Robards; mother (Nora McPhee) played by Marsha Mason; the teenager (Michael McPhee) played by Matthew Broderick; and the policeman (Brian Costello) played by Donald Sutherland, starring in the movie, Max Dugan Returns. There are always a few positives and negatives in each movie, and in this one the few positives are Max Dugan brings Nora and Michael a lot of money, buys them very expensive gifts to lets them think... Just because he came out of jail, doesn't mean he's an evil guy. He wants to make them happy. Although the policeman wants to be a friend, is he only doing his job too. The few negatives is that there's a lot of dishonesty going around. Nora's cars get stolen in one week, and she doesn't accept the gifts that were given to her by her father. I think the theme is about honesty and dishonesty. There's not a lot of honesty in this movie. Nora and Max tell lies about him, because she doesn't want to lose her father again. They are tryig to hide his real image. don't lie, 'cause the truth has to come out some time. Nora McPhee, was a wonderful mother and Gr.10 teacher. Before her father came back into her life, she was a single mother, because her husband had died of cancer. Then she accepts her father to come and live with them, just for a few weeks. Before that, she had a really old car, that was about to fall into pieces. Then the policeman, Brian, gave her a motorcycle to get around with, but shortly after that the bike got stolen too. Her father then suprized her with a new car. She didn't want to accept any of the gifts, because she said, she doesn't wants gifts than was bought with stolen money. The policeman, Brian Costello started to like Nora McPhee. He bought her a bike as soon as he found out that her car was stolen. Then they went out for dinner, when she dropped her handbag, he knew something was wrong. Then he saw an old man in her house, when he wanted to put the flowers he gave her in the house, because she left them in his car. Matthew Broderick was the teenager, Michael McPhee. He always had a problem with baseball. The next morning when he woke up, he saw an old man in the kitchen. He then asked his mother who the old man was and she said Mr. Parker his grandfather. Now Michael is  confused over who the old man living with them really was. He accepted all the gifts that the man gave them, but he has to convince his mother to accept them too. Bacause he had a problem with baseball Mr. Parker got someone to help him.If I were a film judge, I would grade this film an eight. It's a funny movie with a theme to it. I enjoyed this movie and I also encourage everyone to watch it. "},{"Title":"You can advice from this movie. But you must learn only good things","Date":"11 February 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  If you watch Max Dugan Returns, you can learn somethings. I will talk about this story which was written by Neil Simon.  There were some positive and negative things.  Some actors were good, but some actors were not. Neil Simon's story has a good theme.  He teaches good things by comedy. But some movie is not good, because it doesn't make comedy, and he used bad words too many times. I think this story's theme is honesty.  If you are honest, you can prove everything.  Don't lie that can make you a bad person.  So this movie teaches about honesty. Max Dugan was played by Jason Robards.  He was a very good actor for he acted so real.  I can feel Max Dugan's feeling by his acting.  But he used too many bad words.  He must fix his language. Nora McPhee was played by Marsha Mason.  She was a good actress, but she was not as good as Jason Robards. When I see her, I can say she is acting. I can't feel it very well.  If Mason works on her acting, she can be a good actress. I can't understand the policeman's feeling.  He changes his feeling too many times.  He's act to be irresolute.  He needs to change it.  Donald Sutherland's acting was not good.  It was bad because he doesn't act like a policeman. Matthew Broderick was not bad, but he was not good, either. I can tell he is a teenager, but he doesn't have any feeling in his acting.  He looks like he doesn't care about acting. This film's grade is 4.  Because the actors were not perfect.  It was not a good comedy.  They used bad words. and students smoked on T.V. Teenagers can learn about that. So if this film changes these problems.  This film can be perfect. There were good parts. but the acting was not good.  Too many bad things concerned me in Max Dugan Returns.

Since I haven't seen the whole movie I will tell you about half what happened in the movie. The negative thing in the movie, was they used some bad words.  The positive thing that I learn from this movie was always do the right things, do not hurt anyone in any kind of ways. Neil Simon is trying to say be with your family; dont ever stop caring about your family.  Always take care of them no matter how much it will cost because it is mom and dad who gave birth to you.  If you leave them or stop caring about them they will regret why they gave birth to you. Jason Robards did a real good job as Max Dugan.  He did not mess up, he had confidence in himself.  He would not take no for an answer and he really cared about his family. Marsha Mason did  real good job in acting also, because she had confidence in herself.  She did a nice job as a mother and she did a fine job as a daughter. The policeman thought there was something wrong or there was something going on with his girlfriend Nora MCPhee.  How did she get a brand new car, and $5000 in cash in her purse?  So he started getting worried.  Then he wondered if Nora's dad gave her the money. Mathew Broderick palyed a role in this movie as Nora McPhee's son Michael McPhee.  He was just like the other kids played sports and do what others did.  He did not know about his grandfather.  His mom did not tell him but he was worried about his mom too that where is she getting all the mony and all the new stuff from. I give this film a 10 because i really liked this film especially because they had baseball stuff in the film.  Baseball is my favriote sport.

(spoilers)","Date":"29 May 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  This movie is very much like Neil Simon's earlier comedy, Seems Like Old Times. There, Chevy Chase plays Goldie Hawn's ex-husband who is mistakenly accused of a crime. Avoiding cops and just about everyone else, she tries to hide him in her house. But it's difficult keeping his presence a secret when pops up everytime she turns around, a cause of many comedic mishaps.Max Dugan is a similar story, but the comedy is much less a slapstick routine, and more triggered by the characters. It is a delightful comedy, and one of many of Jason Robards and Marsha Mason's great performances. It is also Matthew Broderick and Keifer Sutherland's film debuts (although you hardly get to see Sutherland). Marsha Mason is the smart, witty Nora McPhee, a single mother and English teacher, who can't seem to keep up with the amount of things that go wrong in her day. In that style of 'Prisoners of Second Avenue,' McPhee's problems are all based on Murphy's Law. If can go wrong, you better believe it will. But, in 'Prisoners of Second Avenue,' it was used to illustrate the problems of city life. Here, it is the setting for something else.Jason Robards is the elusive Max Dugan, Nora's father who she hadn't seen since he walked on his family as a child. Imagine her reaction when he shows up on her doorstep one evening. She is none too thrilled. But Max is desperate for a place to lay low. Carrying a suitcase full of stolen cash (which he considers mere compensation for money stolen from him), he needs to hide from the police. So, he poses as a man renting one of the rooms.Except, it becomes quite difficult for Nora to hide her father from her new boyfriend, a curious detective played by Donald Sutherland. Especially, when Dugan keeps using his money to buy her and her son extremely lavish gifts and home repairs, something she could never afford in a lifetime of working as a public school teacher. But, Max only wants the best for his daughter. However, Nora wants to drive home the point that it is genuine affection she is after from her father, not money. The whole situation presents a number of hilarious sequences, especially when Nora has to do some quick explaining as to where her new car, diamond earrings, or a wad full of fifties in her purse, are mysteriously coming from. It is one of Neil Simon's best movies, and one with great chemistry between Mason and Robards, who are essentially the entire movie.

I realize now that this movie makes an ideal holiday film, one that should best be seen around either Christmas/New Year's, or Thanksgiving holiday time. Why? Simply because it has such a strong family values theme to it. (Oh, and Max Dugan (Jason Robards) is also very generous with giving splendid gifts to his daughter and grandson (Marsha Mason and Matthew Broderick) in the film).Perhaps a bit corny by today's film standards, I would nevertheless recommend this film to anyone who lived through the 80's - at least to those who were cognizant of everything that was going on around them. It should stimulate a few memories of the zeitgeist of the 80's (like, think materialism and philosophy) - and it's all done without special effects or smoke and filter-lens photography.This film shows Jason Robards in one of his best roles, with that deep, smooth, mellifluous voice of his just hitting all the right notes. Matthew Broderick is fun to watch in this film as well; it's an early peek at his big-screen work before he hit it big as Ferris Bueller in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Donald Sutherland is interesting as always, and Marsha Mason is excellent as the single mom trying to cope with all the crazy stuff happening to her.If you like this film, I would recommend you rent Rocket Gibraltar (1988) starring Burt Lancaster. Another excellent family film that showcases a well-known actor in one of his last film roles.

To spend a couple of days because he was going to die. This movie I think was good.  In an aspect of family and unity was really good, but the film itself, had little problems, like the sound didn't sound very clear.  The other problem was the images were blurry and scenes were not well lit.  Maybe because the film is old. I think Neil Simon it is still missing his wife.  But the mother of Michel McPhee (Marsha Mason) is his wife in real life. I could say this was Neil Simon Returns because he really came up with good stuff in this film. The best actor in this movie is Jason Robards.  He was funny,serious at the time to saying a lie and always was doing something useful, for example cooking or buying things.

To say that this movie is loosely based on a modernized version of that book would be accurate; the script would be totally different if Victor Hugo never existed.  Let's run down the list of parallels.  Robards is Jean-Valjean he served time in prison and now dedicates his life to the happiness of a young child, Matt(Cossette).  Like Valjean, he has three aliases and --SPOILER-- disappears at the end.  Although in Les Miserables, Hugo meant his disappearance to symbolize death.  Robards' life in this movie revolves around being pursued and followed by a detective(Javert in Les Miserables).  Javert's life-long ambition was to wrest Valjean, just as Sutherland becomes obsessed with this concept as it applies to Robards.  Simon's theme is that family ought to be highly valued--one of the multiple themes contained in Hugo's novel.  Swirl corny 80's elements--the baseball games--into to the rancid bowl, and a movie compiled of Hugo's ideas forms.This comedy has some other horrific extras that force the characters to act like slow-witted Kawala bears.  When Robards goes out in public, he wears a dark jacket, a black hat, and sunglasses...because that doesn't look suspicious at all.  Were you trying to look like a criminal, Roby?If you're into typical family-oriented 80's slosh(and many people evidently are) then I recommend this film with one reservation.  Sutherland and Robards, the two best actors in this treasure, only have one scene together because that makes sense!

Be sorry with big mistake from him, and try to run and help his daughter's family. Max Dugan is a fantastic man.  He comes back home when its midnight and raining outside.  He tries the best he can by surprise presents to his daughter and grandson.  Helps a daughter open her account by illegal money. And negatives about his performance, why a policeman finds Max Dugan, but doesn't put him go in trial. Nora McPhee is a normal teacher in high school, also a single mother who lived with her teenage son.  She is an unlucky woman.  McPhee was angry about her father left home long time ago but nothing to do, because anyway Max Dugan alway her father.  Happy, angry of a woman with one time two problems need to revolve. The policeman comes to try to help Nora McPhee.  He was spending the time taking Mrs. McPhee to dinner.  He gave to her a dozen roses.  Because he loved her.  But a conflict of love and job he need to take her father go back trial. Michael McPhee is teenager son who lived with his mom in a  small house. He was a young man doesn't have a best communicate before his grandfather return.  He can't play a good baseball in school.  He's so good behavior of a son in a family.  At the end of the movie Michael McPhee is a man play off baseball game.The film grade is 10.  Good movie, which was written by Neil Simon.  The movie wants to tell about basic family in social class.  It isn't easy to run family of single mother.  And a man never loved his family before, now returns. In conclusion, it's a good movie.  Joking movie but inside a movie wants to tell people how to love, share, and care a family with a people didn't or doesn't love family.  That's Neil Simon truly tell us social class always like that.  How many characters in a movie that's many kind of people near us right now.  That's a good movie I never saw before.

When I watched Neil Simon's Max Dugan Returns, it looked like an old movie. People's hair styles, fashion and cars are all old. My teacher said this movie was made in 1983. This movie is old, but it was really interesting! I read another Neil Simon story The Good Doctor before watching this movie. I think Neil Simon's story has many characters. It should separate positives and negatives. I think the positives are love of family. The parent and child, love each other and they take care of other. I think the negatives are luxuries Nora's father has a lot of money. He uses that money for his daughter and grandson, but actually that was luxury. When I watched this movie, I could know about love of family. Max Dugan loves his daughter and his grandson, so he wnats to do anything for them. Nora McPhee loves her father and her son. She worried about her father and she takes cares of her son. Michael McPhee loves his grandfather and his mom He tried to understand what happened to his grandfather and his mom. I think they love each other and take care. Max Dugan is Nora's father and Michael's grandfather. I think he is a good father and grandfather. He used his money for them and he did do anything for his family. It could be positives. But he was in jail for six years and he got that money from a casino. He is good parent and grandparent, but he is a criminal anyways. It could be negatives. Nora McPhee is Michael's mom and Max's daughter. She is a daughter of father and mom of a son, but she is a teacher also. I think she is a good actress because she did do good. She did do good in her role of daughter, mom, and teacher. Brian Costello is a policeman. He loves Nora McPhee. He's supposed to arrest Max Dugan because Brian is a policeman, but loves Nora so he couldn't arrest Max. He is a policeman, but I think he didn't do in his role.Michael McPhee is the son of Nora and grandson of Max. He is a teenager and he goes to high school. I think he is good, but I saw him smoking a cigarette which is a negative habit. I am not an actress, but when he was acting, I think that his acting didn't have emotions. If I give the film a rating, I just want to give 10 points because this was funny and interesting. When I watched the last part, I was sad just a little bit and sometimes I saw bad things. For example, Nora is an English teacher, but sometimes she used bad language like cussing. But when I see the whole story, it is intersting so I could laugh. I like Neil Simon's story. When I read the other Neil Simon story, that was interesting for me.

Some families have a happy life together, some others may not.  Besides, there are some families separated for a while for some reasons, but they reunite later on.  This is the story of one such family, the Dugan's family. The movie Max Dugan Returns by Neil Simon, teaches us a good lesson to be a good person in a worse situation.  Desperate, Nora lives without her father and mother who died young when she was just a little girl.  Not because of these reasons above she became a spoiled girl, but in contrast she is a good person, a good mother and a good teacher.  On the negative side of the movie, the father doesn't have the responsibilities for his family. He left his family while his daughter was still very young. One of the themes Neil Simon tries to tell us was the relationship of a family.  When a member of a family for some reasons has to leave home, they usually will come back to their roots. Jason Robards is one of five people receiving the 1999 Kennedy Center Honors.  He plays a role as Max Dugan, a man who left his wife; his daughter and he doesn't have responsibilities to his family.  He comes back with a large amount of money after 26 years and asks his daughter to allow him to live with her, and his grandson, Michael.  When he lives there, he lies to Michael that he is Mr. Parker and later is Mr. Daughterson.  But at the same time he loves and takes care of every thing in her house, he buys a new television, VCR, refrigerator, a new car and he even changes her old house to be a new house. Mr. Dugan's daughter, Nora McPhee, is a very good person.  She also is a good mother, a good teacher and especially she is very honest.  She never accepts any thing that she thinks it not legitimate from her father.  One of the negative things about Nora is her carelessness.  She lost her car for the first time because she left the key in her car and again she continues to forget the key of the motorcycle, so she lost it again. Brian Costello was a policeman and she is also Nora's boyfriend.  He knew that Nora not a wealthy person, but things change when Mr. Dugan appears in her house, Nora becomes richer. Every thing in her house is expensive. She also has $5000 cash in her purse.  Those make him become more suspicious. He began to investigate where the money comes from and who is the man in Nora's home and where does that money come from. Michael McPhee is a well-behaved teenage boy.  He is very naive when Mr.Dugan returns.  He is very surprised and naive when Mr. Dugan bought lots of things for his house and his room, and he loves it.  He doesn't have a lot of specific questions about how the new appliances appeared in his house. The best grade for this movie Max Dugan Return is 8 because this movie helps us understand more how importance of the family relationship and how honesty should be.

We can learn some things from the story.  The characters can play well enough.  It is like a real situation even though it is created.  I recommend for teenagers to watch. The movie contained many positives and negatives.  It is positive because the plot told us the good ways to use money.  According to the story, no money was wasted.  Mr. Parker bought good things for Michael and Nora.  It was also negative because he did not earn that money. I shall say it is honesty because only honesty can bring a good family. If Mr. Parker told Nora told the truth he would not have to discuss leaving. Since he did not tell them where the money come from and who exactly he is Nora, and Michael would not confuse.  If he was honest may be he would not be in jail or spend less time in jail.  The dishonesty of Mr. Parker caused he, and Nora and Michael to separate. Jason Robard's performance in the story was basically good.  I hope it was better than what the director expected.  The ways he talked, and the ways he acted were good, especially, the ways he acted when a cop, Brian, came to Nora's house.  The ways he dressed were incredible.  He was ridiculous, too. Mason's acting was funny.  She was kind of upset all the time.  Also when she dated the cop, she was really nervous.  Every time Mr. Parker bought new stuff to her home she acted like she did not want them.  She yelled at her son all the time not to touch, or do anything with it. I like no cop.  If Nora did not date Brain the whole story would change different ways.  Mr. Dugan, Michael, and Nora should be able to live together.  He was not officially authorized to investigate Mr. Dugan.  It is against the Federal Law to picture some one without their permission unless it is Federal case. He did more than what he should have done. Broderick played his role very well.  He exactly played as how teenagers act.  He is really funny, too.  When Mr. Parker bought new things he really loves them and operates them even though her mom asked him not to touch them.  The ways he played baseball were also great. I think the film deserved to get 8.5 if 10 is the highest and 0 is the lowest.  I chose this because it is not the kind of movie I enjoy, truthfully.  They are not my favorite actors.  I think they need to get better places, setting to make a good movie to get a higher grade. I shall close by analyzing the whole movie that it is not so bad to watch. There was almost no foul languages used, less violence, and it only contains a few sexually oriented parts.  They could play well enough to make us non bored.  Yet, this movie is not the best.  I, therefore, shall say this movie is more effective for young people than any other.

Do you know who is Neil Simon? There is a funny, family movie. Max Dugan Returns was written by Neil Simon. It is old but has a strong performing group. Neil Simon, Kennedy Center Honoree in 1995, a distinguished playwright to be rich in comedic play. His scripts are always very short, but humorous and funny. That's why they are welcomed by most people. Also on the other hand, his plays hold extreme satire. Max Dugan Returns described a strange family. Nora McPhee is a single mom and a teacher. Things changed when Nora's dad, who had left her when she was a child, suddenly returned to her life. Under the bizarre plot, Neil Simon tried to define the love between the strange family. Max Dugan is played by Jason Robards - another Kennedy Center Honoree in 1999. He returned to his daughter and grandson with five million dollars to renew the relationship with them, but the money is illegal. Mr.Robards's acting is skillful and funny for he showed a father who deeply loved his daughter and grandson. Marsha mason was the mother, Nora McPhee. I like this role. Marsha Mason showed a strict, interesting, intelligient woman. Her father won over everybody except her. When she knows the money was from gambling, she rejected it, but she still loved her father. Marsha Mason's performance is also excellent, actually she performed four different characters the daughter of a man with much unknown money, the mother of an energetic boy, the teacher and a policeman's girlfriends. It is hard work, but she displayed a most beautiful character. Donald Sutherland played a very important part in the movie - Brian Costello. He is a policeman, but also loves Nora McPhee, thus contradiction appears between him and Max Dugan. He suspects the money was lawless, which brings the conflict into the story. Matthew Broderick was the teenager, Micheal McPee, an active boy whose dream is getting a hit in baseball. Although this is Matthew in his first movie, he absolutely did a good job, successfully performed a simple boy who is easily deceived by his grandpa. I like this movie for it has great acting, writing and lots of fun for the whole family. But we have to recognize, Max Dugan is a good father but a good man. My grade for this movie is 9. Don't you  want to know what will happen for this family at last? What should Nora do? where do the money and Max go? Does Michael really get a hit in baseball? I recommend this movie to people. This is a refreshing family movie with values.

Just because he came out of jail, doesn't mean he's an evil guy. He wants to be a friend, but he's only doing his job too. The negatives are that there's a lot of dishonesty going around. Nora's cars get stolen in one week, and  she doesn't want to accept the gifts that were given to her by her father. I think the theme is about honesty and dishonesty.

Your love life's in trouble. The car won't start. Your boss has no heart. The door squeaks. The roof leaks. Your stereo just went mono. All you need is a little Max Dugan.) But the movie disappeared quickly, and it seemed to have vanished completely, since I never remember it coming on television. I was surprised that it received a DVD release, since there was nothing to indicate it had built a cult. Anyway, I decided to finally watch it.Although it's branded as a comedy, it really isn't. Yes, there is the occasional one-liner, but mostly it's a light-hearted drama. And a charming one at that. Neil Simon wrote some very likable characters, even down to the ones who show up quickly and disappear never to be seen again in the movie. The cast could not be better. Broderick in his debut performance tones it down compared to how annoying he became when he was older. Sutherland is believable as a cop who has feelings for the woman in his life yet still feels he has his duty as a cop. Robards and Mason, who have most of the focus, are also good.The movie isn't without problems - there are a few spots where the characters seem unusually dim-witted - but overall it's a sweet movie that will make you feel good at the end.

Many of the pictures were sub-par, but Max Dugan was a good swan song, in part due to Marsha Mason (if there were an Oscar for Best Couple, she and Dreyfuss should have received it for Goodbye Girl) but also simply because it's a neat little movie that's never received its due. Matthew Broderick's first movie. Donald Sutherland got a new haircut. Jason Robards may have been cast as an afterthought to lend cachet, but who else could play the ironic, world-weary, Kierkegaard-and-Wittgenstein-reading jailbird title character? I only have one acquired gripe that so much of the dialogue is so sharp and witty that it feels contrived (not that they aren't memorable). This is one of the rare instances when a screenplay may be almost polished out of existence. That said, if you don't have a warm spot, you can forget it. This isn't a cinematic masterpiece (and I say that as a Polanski-and-Coppola type); but the story is neat and the performances are genuine, and in a decade when films set in L.A. focused primarily on glitz and bling-bling (which Max Dugan indirectly parodies), it's still refreshing to be made to feel at home among the sunlit bungalows of the city's low-key/low-rent, lower middle class suburbs.

Max Dugan abandoned Nora Mcphee when she was a little girl and she thought that he had died a long time ago.  Max Dugan came back to Nora Mcphee and he wanted to apologise for his mistake, and so he got her all of those good things like a car.  Nora Mcphee didn't want the money that Max Dugan was giving her, because she thought it was stolen. The thing is that he came back for her and his grandson.  Max Dugan thought that giving her money will make her take his apology, but she didn't care about the money.  I think that it was a good idea for him to go and look everyone too.  family is always important.Max Dugan has positive and negative things to talk about.  Max Dugan made a bad decision gambling and steeling money.  I think that was a very bad thing to do.  Jason Robards has mostly all positive performances because he was a really good actor.

In the beginning of the movie I thought that he was going to be mean and bad but he turned out to be a really good guy.
