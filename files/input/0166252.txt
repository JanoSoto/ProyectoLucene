[{"Title":"An appreciation of the (often funny) kinds of feelings we have for one another","Date":"30 October 1999","Score":"14 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Wow!  I'm surprised to see so many negative and lukewarm opinions on this movie, which I had never heard of (apparently it was not highly promoted by the studio) but which I luckily stumbled upon on an international flight.  I so thoroughly enjoyed it that now I'm interested in more by director Peter Chan and screenwriter Maria Maggenti.  I did not know there was a book, either, but I've made a note of it for future reading, too.I admit I feel a bit defensive now, in the face of the other comments here on IMDB.  So, what did I like and why did I like it?  First of all, unlike some other viewers, I thought the movie WAS very funny.  It takes sort of a Steve-Martinesque view of the tender absurdity of humans and their feelings about each other (OK, OK, I just saw a stage production of Picasso at the Lapin Agile, and the tone reminded me somewhat of this).  Although there is physical humor, too, what I liked most were light touches, like how Ellen DeGeneres' character instantly, wordlessly went back to working for her boss (played by Kate Capshaw) as soon as she got the apology she felt she deserved -- after insisting with great finality that it was all over.I also felt this film was a celebration of the beautiful but almost lunatic breadth and diversity of the kinds of feelings we group together under the heading of love  everything from young (and older) wide-eyed lust, to slow steady enduring commitment.  As well as friendships, coworker relationships like the one just mentioned, family bonds . . . the list goes on.Most of all, I guess I appreciated the fond, loving tone of the movie.  The artists seem really to like, and love, people.  Yes, there ARE quite a few characters, and they're all different ages and different sexes, they're about different trials and tribulations, but they're all treated with light-hearted love and respect, for the sometimes silly but vulnerable beings we all are.So, if YOU like people, I think you'd like this movie.

It's about opportunities that are missed because people aren't more forward about their feelings. The humour isn't wacky like in most American films. Assuming the director's seat, Chan does quite a good job of portraying the small dockside town and introducing its quirky characters. The story interestingly intertwines the lives of the characters through a love letter. The dialogues are pleasant and the acting is quite good. Kate Capshaw does a good job of carrying the film and maintains a good chemistry with her co-stars. Tom Everett Scott fits the part.It was odd to see Danner play Capshaw's mother because the age difference did not seem believable enough. Tom Selleck was alright. Ellen Degeneres and Geraldine McEwan are scene stealers. In addition, I was amazed by the whimsical soundtrack that flows beautifully with the film, pumping some energy into it and would work well as a standalone score. IU felt the film would have benefited more had their been more comedic situations. At times it gets too serious and that needed to be toned down a little. I liked how it ended without showing the two lovers kissing (as has been evident in x number of rom-coms) but instead suggesting a promising future for them together. 'The Love Letter' was a pleasant watch, a kind of slice of life film.

Who is it from? Therein lies the tale. Working for her in the book store are a handsome college student (Tom Everett Scott), a feisty store manager (Ellen DeGeneres), and a sweet young teenager (Juliane Nicholson). Waiting in the wings is Tom Selleck, the town fireman, who has held a torch for Capshaw all his life. These are all pleasant folks to spend a couple of hours with. The town is picturesque and the background score is romantic (by Luis Bacalov, composer of Il Postino). It's interesting to note that everyone does not end up with whom you expect. Supporting roles are ably, though too briefly, handled by Blythe Danner and Gloria Stewart (Titanic). Director, Peter Chan, who has been involved in the Hong Kong film world, has done surprisingly well with this material which is so American. I'm sure we'll be hearing from him again.

Director Peter Chan's take on the story looks good on the screen; what with the picturesque setting of Rockford, Ma., as the background and all the cute houses where the story takes place. The result is a film that is easy on the eye, but alas, like eating a Chinese dinner, it leaves us hungry for more.Helen, the owner of a book store, finds a letter between the cushions of the couch of the shop. She reads it, and it sounds intriguing, because the writer goes to express how deeply he feels for the person the letter has been sent to. Since it has no name, Helen assumes it has been intended for her alone. She believes Johnny, the young assistant, has sent it to her. The young man, who likes the older Helen, is only too happy to tell her how he feels about her.Basically, The Love Letter is a story about missed opportunities. Helen who was in love with George, the local chief firefighter, married someone else, but her marriage failed. George also is getting a divorce. George confesses he had gone away to New York when he was younger to get away from Helen and his life in town and he had also sent her a postcard from New York, which Helen had kept, but had not read the message inserted within the card. It's at this moment when Helen comes to her senses when she realizes her affair with Johnny is only a summer fling.The film will be liked by the audience for which it was targeted. Kate Capshaw, who produced the movie, is fine as Helen. Tom Everett Scott plays Johnny. Blythe Danner, Geraldine McEwen, Julianne Nicholson, Tom Selleck, Ellen DeGeneres, and the rest of the cast do good work also.The film has an ironic twist at the end when the real recipient of this letter is revealed.

I must admit that I had no desire to actually see this movie even though I have a weakspot for romantic comedies (I don't know why).  The trailers I saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be about.  In the end I found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself and must admit that I thought that this film was one of the most overlooked gems of last year.  I am disappointed that so few people seemed to have enjoyed the very human-ness that this movie presented the viewer with.I have read many bad reviews of this film, and must admit a certain level of shock at the cynicism that is prevalent in them.

Held back by a remarkably asinine trailer--which manages to combine the three or four dull, brief moments in the movie--the picture is a warm-hearted, eminently watchable tale. I had assiduously avoided the flick because of that very trailer, but ended up having to watch The Love Letter on an 11 hour flight from Seoul to Vancouver. I could easily have watched it three times--it's that much fun.Kate Capshaw is bent and broken-down but somehow manages to be both incredibly lovable and believable. Tom Everett Scott is absolutely priceless in his role as a confused young hunk. but any damage they may have done to the overall film is negated by the superb performances of Scott and Capshaw. Sure, it's not worthy of an Oscar. But neither was Shakespeare in Love, and look what happened there.

The story is really touching, and the ending is very appropriate. I feel I really care for many characters in this film. I feel I can feel their feelings. While most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this one completely makes me feel involved, starting from the scene of Capshaw running along the beach with Scott until the ending scene. I want to rate this film 11 out of 10, because I want to give an extra one point for the ending.       The acting part is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a good opportunity to show her talent. Though I'm not impressed with Scott in `Dead Man on Campus,' this film completely changes my viewpoint towards him. He's so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is as terrific as ever.     This film might not be as good, complex, deep, or believable as other films which deal a little bit with the same kind of relationship, such as `L'ecole de la chair' or 'Post coitum, animal triste,' but `The Love Letter' can still be proud of itself as it casts a rare different light on that kind of relationship. And that difference makes this film eminently enjoyable. By being unambitious and relying on great charms of small stars, Dreamworks, this time you really make my dream come true.

Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. Working at Helen's store are the manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, George (Tom Selleck), and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott). One day, Helen stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that Johnny has written it for her. Throwing caution to the wind, Helen and Johnny begin a small-time thing. But, the letter subsequently lands in others' hands, including Janet's, who thinks George has sent it to her, and Johnny's, who imagines Helen has penned it for him. And, on and on the letter goes. But, in truth, George possibly has eyes for Helen and Jennifer has fallen hard for Johnny. The town's museum curator, too, may have a secret love. Will tangled affairs like these ever straighten themselves out? This is a cute movie with a gorgeous setting and capable stars. Each of the main actors gives a pleasing performance, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to those mentioned previously. Then, too, the coastal scenery is most lovely, the costumes quite well-chosen, and the photography very nice indeed. There are a few surprises, including a subtle gay plot development, which may not please all viewers. But, for those who love romantic comedies, this one should be included on any list of good choices for the genre.

While it was not as popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on VHS/DVD. Set in a seaport town in the good old USA (I forget the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious, passionately written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters, each who think the letter is personally addressed to them. By the end of the film, we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town. The cast is made up of wonderful actors who have fared well on TV and film, among them Kate Capshaw in the lead role of middle-aged beauty Helen, a bookstore owner, comedienne Ellen DeGeneres as her friend/employee Janet Hall, young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the young 20 something guy who falls for the older Hellen and an older Tom Selleck as the firefighter George Matthias who must compete with Johnny for Helen's affections. There are cameo roles by veteran old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly Rose in Titanic (1997) and a cameo by Kate Capshaw's own daughter (with husband Steven Spielberg) Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, each of whom feel as passionately for Helen as the writer of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will she choose the right person ? Which man has the most to offer her ? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own, and is in fact, a kind of reminder of what Helen was like at her age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life. A cultured intellectual, he takes Helen on an opera date, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine Tosca moves Helen to explosive tears. There are lots of beautiful vistas of the charming coastal town, rendered beautifully by cinematographer Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs -  I've Never Been In Love Before, I'm In The Mood For Love and Only The Lonely. Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, who is consistently late to her job at Helen's bookshop, who endlessly dates men without being able to find the right guy , is simply wonderful. She has not lost her comedic flair, even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on TV or film because only about two years before her hit mid-90's TV show Ellen was cancelled because of her coming out as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject matter of the show. Here you even find comedian Jack Black, long before he made it big, in the bit part of a fisherman. This is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant, about the human need for a passionate consuming love and the general love of escapism brought not only through books, letters, and music, but through a genuinely loving and secure relationship. This is a great film with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit.

Not unlike, Wong Kar Wai's poorly executed, but well meaning My Blueberry Night, the premise seems very much Korean and the idea of a love letter creating multiple opportunities of love is more corny and cheesy than believable. Seriously if you see an untitled love letter randomly on a table at someone's else home, it is very likely that you will take it seriously to heart and take it as a piece of salt instead. The answer is clear and the whole idea is flawed from the beginning. Here is how Chan works his magic on the audience and trick us to believe and takes us along the ride in a somewhat light hearted and slightly heart-warming view of nothing else than love.In one of Kate Capshaw's final on-screen display, she is ably casted as a single middle aged woman trying to find love again despite the odds. In fact the film would not have been watchable if not for Capshaw's performance and Chan's persistent style of direction. I have always called Chan a romantic director as he goes for the depth of characters and their stories in unprecedented details. Unfortunately, in this film, Chan is clearly lost in translation and its a definite shame.All in all, like most Asian directors cutting it out in the golden mountain of Hollywood, Chan is unable to replicate his best works. No matter how you see this film from whatever angle, for a Hollywood movie it is just too corny to connect with the Western audience and for the Asian audience we have seen too many Comrades, Alan and Eric and countless better cinematic experience. Still, Chan did not fully fail as some fun can still be had, except by his standards, this is an epic fail by all proportions&#x85;.Neo rates it 5.5/10- www.thehkneo.com "},{"Title":"A good film that's nearly great","Date":"28 May 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Although it's definitely an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it's always worth a watch, this film never quite meets the targets that it should for two reasons. Firstly, after the first forty-five minutes or so it focuses heavily on Helen and Johnny, who are far less interesting characters than most of the others - Janet, Jennifer, George and Miss Scattergoods are all much more enticing. Although at first this works, since in life we don't always know everything about everyone else, and because the point is being made that perhaps Helen is slightly self-involved, it quickly wears thin and we want to see more of the other characters.Secondly, the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half. The letter itself holds far less significance than it does in the first half and, again, although this works well in some ways, it seems odd to leave so much of the potential displayed in the first half behind.Overall, this film is sweet and good-natured, with some genuinely hilarious moments - for example, Janet explaining condiments to an avid audience. The lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is heavy and the sense of living in a small seaside town is accurately portrayed, but the film isn't quite as intelligent as it's trying to be. It just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life. However, it's still good and if you get the chance, it's definitely worth seeing.

Pet project for actress/co-producer Kate Capshaw, who gives a warm, nicely-modulated lead performance, yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in. Initially, Capshaw's Helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her (an interesting visual joke) but the first person they do this ploy with is Ellen DeGeneres, who doesn't play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick. Different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick, and the continuity is extremely choppy. Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly acts with his shirt off) is very good, but they can't save the final act, which is disappointing.

One day at work, Helen happens across an anonymous letter (the `love letter' of the title) that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch.  Upon reading the amorous prose therein, she believes it has been written to her, purposely placed in the couch for her to find, and, for reasons of her own, thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer.  Inadvertently, however, Helen leaves the letter out where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, believes it to be for her, and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it.  Circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks Helen has written the letter to him.  And before it all gets sorted out, you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast; and I do mean imagine, because the way this movie plays out, the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself. 	There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably  It simply isn't very romantic, and it's not funny; and that is a potent combination that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits.  Once the setting and main character (Helen) have been established, it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so.  By the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter, and to whom, you could care less.   	Rounding out the cast is Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan.  It's a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this, and looking bad in the balance.  Kate Capshaw, who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up, looks tired here, while Selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender that's lasted a week.  Ellen DeGeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch.  It is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination.  In the case of `The Love Letter,' however, it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place.  I rate this one 1/10.         "},{"Title":"5.2  ....

Then again, I'm sure someone here will also be able to come up with a literary (and thus older) comparison just to prove there's nothing new under the sun. But then again, as my father says, sometimes how you say it is more important than what you say. Unfortunately, that does not happen here. While the target of the movie is a more adult audience and there's more warmth put into this version, the reality is that that old teenage movie was funnier and, shall I say it, more romantic. The biggest problem is the main character.  It's hard to feel any compassion for Helen (Kate Capshaw) who is fooling around with one guy, while pretending to be interested in another.  And, for being a 'chick' flick with mostly female protagonists, it is amazing how underdeveloped most female characters are.  We hardly know anything of Janet (Ellen De Generis) other than she gets angry, we know little or nothing of Miss Scattergoods, or about Helen's mother or grandma.  The only female character that does seem to share some trace of humanity is Jennifer, the young and slightly dumb girl. Tom Selleck seems to be the only one in tune with the material and the only that can make us feel something as a poor man who has been secretly in love with Helen all his life. Still, you can enjoy yourselves trying to guess how many Capshaw's and Spielberg's are there in this movie.

Love Letter is based on a book by Cathleen Schine and it is filled to the brim with characters who directly(and wonderfully) effect each other.  It also creates a warm small town feel that many movies fail to recreate.  Due to it's literary origins, the 88 minutes the filmmakers have to play with here hardly does justice to the story.  By stripping away the essential nuances that made the book such a beloved piece of writing, the film stumbles without the sturdy dramatic foundation that was in the material at one point. The modern Yoko herself, Kate Capshaw, stars and executive produces this flick - so I hold her directly responsible.  She's been a good actress over the years but never quite topped her star making role in the second Indiana Jones film.  It seems the perfect choice to cast herself in the starring role.  She brings just the right balance of mousiness and heated sexuality to the role.  Other cast members like Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, and Blythe Danner (in a role that screams cutting room floor) do nice jobs with very blurry roles.  It's Tom Everett Scott - so effective in movies like That Thing You Do! and American Werewolf In Paris - that is miscast.  I don't buy for a single minute the hunk factor that the story suggests. Love Letter is the kind of film that oozes potential.  It's a seemingly nice story with refreshing dramatic undertones.  As I stated before, the story is much too big, much too deep for a measly 88 minutes.  It's a shame so much narrative had to be compacted (without care I might add) into such a tiny amount of time. -------------- 4 "},{"Title":"love is a many splendid letter.","Date":"23 May 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  The sound track of this movie, nearly all modern popular music, sweeps a Pre-Amazon.com book store, where we attend an eighteenth century comedy of manners.

Like I said above, the theme seems to be repression and I understand that is an element of life and love but I don't want to see a movie about it either, at least not this one.  I can't recommend this at all, despite the very talented cast who are left to fend for themselves.

There certainly wasn't much to get overly excited about, but at the same time, there wasn't all that much to be critical of.Probably the single best thing was that it was a romantic comedy - my favorite genre. Because of that I give it a 7, but I see the imdb average is 5.4. I suppose if I wasn't biased to the genre, I probably would have given it a lower score too.I also like Kate Capshaw. I thought she was good, but then I always like her. That was the best specific part of the movie.On the negative side, Ellen D couldn't be in a movie without gay women, but, ironically, she isn't one of them! It was two relatively old women. Excuse me.I'm back. Had to go to the bathroom for a minute.The biggest negative of the movie is that we are forced to assume that the two key couples (men and women) end up together at some point in the future. The thing that makes a romantic comedy a great genre is the fact (simple as it may be) that boy meets girl, falls in love, lives happily ever after. And, although they may, we can't be sure.I liked the concept of the love letter - misunderstood by all parties to be FOR different people and FROM different people. However, I wasn't all that thrilled with where it originated and how it was ultimately dealt with.So, all in all, I'm sure this would not have exceeded a 6 at best if I just didn't like Kate Capshaw - and if I wasn't relatively fond of Tom Selleck - and if it wasn't a romantic comedy. If you don't LOVE the genre, you won't LIKE the movie.

I particularly enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres' perfect deadpan performance.What didn't work for me was (1) the drawn-out affair with the younger man (too long, too seemingly out of character for Helen), (2) the seemingly endless cinematic cliches, mostly visual but including interminable voiced over re-readings of the love letter itself (its contents should have a mystery); (3) a young woman feminist-scholar and, ironically, a fireworks scene (no wonder this reminded me of that horrid How to Make an American Quilt movie);  (4) the bumbling gotcha cop who smells dope everywhere (no cliche there either!); and (5) a nauseatingly romanticized small town setting.I would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of (or even glorify) Helen's bitterness, to have included much more of DeGeneres' character, to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices, and to be a little less uncritical of small town life.Had it been developed as a play first, those criticisms might have been addressed before committing the material to this film, which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre.

The directing and editing both needed work.

It seemed way too melodramatic at times, and I got the feeling that it would be excellent to see on stage, but just doesn't work too well on a screen.  The many twists get a little tiresome, as well.On the other hand, called it an Oedipal thing, but Kate Capshaw was so, SO sexy.  My childhood memories of her include TEMPLE OF DOOM and SPACE CAMP, and this provided better memories of her ).  Her chemistry with her co-stars was great ... ...it's just too bad that the script didn't provide more for the actors to do.

The actors are older but none of them looked particularly good. They needed better make up,photography or something.It is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film. I liked the cast but I think the performances were rather bland. This is where the weakness of the director shows. Perhaps if Mrs. Spielberg had Mr. Spielberg directing it would have been a much better film.

VERY predictable roles (Ellen DeGeneres as a bookstore manager?!), highly predictable plot, and very little substance. It's overloaded on the cast and severely lacking in real meaning. This could've been done as a highly intellectual romantic drama/comedy. Instead it's delivered as a generic romantic comedy that will soon be forgotten.

"}{"Title":"Overdone and Underfunny","Date":"24 May 1999","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  The Love Letter is an alleged romantic comedy from DreamWorks about an anonymous letter to an anonymous recipient which stirs romantic confusion in a small town on the east coast. This film has a multitude of problems, mostly stemming from the casting. The only actors who turn in a decent performance are Tom Everett Scott and Blythe Danner.  And even Danner's presence is a problem.  She is only ten years older than Kate Capshaw, and has fewer wrinkles, and we're supposed to believe that she's Capshaw's mother?  Ellen De Generes is her usual unfunny self, except for her character's implied heterosexuality.  Everyone else (particularly Tom Selleck) is just flat and dull. Another problem is that there are too many extreme close-ups of Capshaw's face. What completely undermines this film however, is the writing.  Maria Maggenti is of the school of screenwriting that says cuteness and quirkiness are acceptable substitutes for genuine humor.  There is a character in the film who tries too hard to show how feminist she is to cover up the fact that she has a crush on Scott's character.  I think Maggenti tried too hard on this character and others.  And as for the answers to the two main questions of the film (who sent the letter to whom, and who does Capshaw end up with), one is telegraphed a good twenty minutes before it is revealed, and the other is never satisfactorily resolved. Overall, I gave this film six stars out of ten, just because it wasn't completely awful and a few of the jokes actually work.  But overall, this film was overdone and underfunny.

Don't flatter yourself Kate, just because your husband is a billionaire, doesn't mean you'll never age. In a out east way this movie has some charm. If it weren't for the clear gay support of the film, you'd think the homosexual references were a little much. The script has Sundance written all over it, but the filming is a weak attempt. If you're ready for a movie that's purely entertaining with no actual meaning or moral point, A.K.A a date movie, this is it.The Love letter is simple and not hardly as mysterious as it would aim to be.

You can't have the sound up as high as you'd want and the sound of her gently breathing (or snoring if you're being harsh) make me want to close my eyes as well. A feeling amplified many times whilst watching this dull romantic drama, which spent a lot of time going absolutely nowhere with what might have been a good premise.Helen (Kate Capshaw) runs an easy-going bookstore in a sleepy US coastal town, the sort of place where time goes by very slowly. Emotionally frigid and resolutely single, she finds a mysterious love letter in her post and believes it's for her. As her stony heart begins to melt, she begins a relationship with her work colleague Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) who both believe that the letter is meant for them. But is Johnny the author or is it Helen's long-time admirer George (Tom Selleck), who feels his last chance with Helen slipping away.This is one of those horrible films that never gets out of first gear. It's painfully slow, dragging on and on and way beyond the point where the viewer has figured out who the author and intended recipient actually is. And quite frankly, you don't really identify with any of the characters because they are little more than cold, wooden stereotypes. Surprisingly, Selleck probably provides the best of the performances but in truth, nobody looks like they're putting much effort into it - Selleck is basically playing his Richard character from Friends without a moustache. The comedic lines are few and far between and there is no chemistry at all between Capshaw & Scott, meaning it fails as a romantic film as well. So all it does is spend the film's duration telling it's story and by the time the credits have rolled by, you'd have already forgotten about it.Aside from the premise, I'm struggling to see what attracted such an experienced and talented cast to this boring snore-fest. This is a film so easy-going, it's damn-near comatose. Neither entertaining nor challenging, I cannot think of a reason why you should watch this hugely disappointing movie. The Love Letter is as dull and uninspired as its title and trust me, don't watch this film unless you are an insomniac or a fan of any old romantic dross on TV. Stick with stuff like Notting Hill which is predictable but infinitely more enjoyable. Right, I'm going back to bed...

The potential to build a compelling story around the anonymous love letter was certainly there, but somehow this movie has not capitalised on this opporutunity and what you are left with is a movie which can't seem to decide if it is a comedy or a drama.Kate Capshaw's character is not developed enough and Tom Selleck seems to be stuck with the likeable oafs these days in the characters he portrays.This movie is certainly forgetable and if you haven't seen yet, do yourself a favour and avoid.

Anyone who has seen this movie should have remained in line for the George Lucas blockbuster.This weak attempt at a romantic comedy centers around the receipt of an unsigned love letter making it into the possession of several of the citizens of the fictional New England town Loblolly-By-The-Sea.  This sets off a series of mismatches and misunderstandings that offer few laughs, if any.When the identity of the author of the letter is finally revealed, unintentional laughter ensues.Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart are horribly underused in token roles. Tom Everett Scott, hot off his work in the Meryl Streep weeper One True Thing and Tom Selleck provide the best performances in what turns out to be a lesbian love story; no, they're not the lesbians -- at least, that would have been funnier.  Kate Capshaw (Mrs. Steven Spielberg) and Ellen DeGeneres are truly painful to watch.Keep this letter in the mailbox -- in fact, send it back to Dreamworks where it belongs.

There is no comedy and what little romance there is has to struggle mightily to escape the horrible script.  It is impossible to work up any interest in the characters, and what interest there could be in the plot theme -- who sent the letter to whom -- gets replaced very early in the movie by thoughts of How much longer is this turkey going to last?  Are we half way done yet?  The scenery was nice, though.  Maybe recut it without all those people and reissue it as a 15-minute travel promo for New England.

I couldn`t help pointing this out because despite having no on screen credit there does seem to be a heavy Spielberg influence in this movie . While this wouldn`t have been a bad thing if it involved either genocide , the D-Day landings or a great white shark the influences seem to be composed of Spielberg flaws like heavy weepy sentiment , sugar coated characters and scenes that go on a tad too long not to mention setting the movie in that middle American town called Dullsville . Was anyone reminded of ET watching this slow paced , boring romantic drama ? YAWN . It is interesting to note that many people were bored senseless by this and that they`ve written very short reviews . It was a problem for me both trying to stay awake watching THE LOVE LETTER and trying to say anything of note in my review . I can only recommend this movie to cure insomnia    "}]
