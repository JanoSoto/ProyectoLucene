In fact, they said it was so wholesome kids of today might not want to see it, meaning it was too goody-goody for them. This shows you how out-of-touch film critics can be because compared to that 1950s show, this is HARDLY a wholesome movie.In this LITB, the young guys are all after girls and sex, use the word suck all the time and the story is filled with 1990s-type Hollywood portrayals and comments (Beaver was excited because he saw an R-rated movie, etc.)Overall, it's still a kid's movie and Cameron Finley is cute as Theodore Beaver Cleaver and his parents are nice, but there are too may moral problems with this version. Stick to the TV shows, especially now that the first two seasons on DVD. Those are fantastic.

I was very curious to see it. Once the movie started, I could tell it was sort of a satire... which is totally cool and fun to watch. Beaver is a very charming character and Wally would be the perfect child if he acted the same in today's society. This movie had my attention the whole way through. It was totally cute, and had a lot of references that little kids may not get ... Erika Christiansen is in this movie too and she looked way different back then. I think they did a good job in this movie trying to portray the way children think and act and perceive the world. Although the mother is portrayed a bit like a Stepford Wife, it isn't that big of a distraction. You really begin to feel for the characters in this movie even though there hasn't been a whole lot of character development.

After I watched it , the video was in my hands.Since it was made from a tv series like The Brady Bunch , it beat them by a long shot.It's worth watching and there's one scene that will tell you something if you pay attention to it. This is when the Beaver and his father are in the coffee cup and they're talking about ' the look '.Eddie Haskell ( Ken Osmond ) appeared to have the right idea on his acting. Being around Ward and June he so polite but if he was with Wally or the Beaver it would be like he knew everything. Everyone else did a good job also. I liked the times whenever Lumpy would be so sloppy and eat anything in sight.The funny thing about this movie is , when he got his bike for his birthday it brings back memories when I got one I kept dreaming about. It's a 20 red Diamond Back , alloy frame , three piece crank & double wall rim ( for all you riders to give you an idea.) That Christmas I thought it was over but sure enough at the last minute here it comes. It was 30* outside but I could care less ! I changed clothes and went for a spin. Since then it's been spotless and this was 4 years ago. I still have it.Again as the movie , there's nothing wrong with it and enjoyable / relaxing for the whole family. There is a true example on this - DON'T let strangers ride your bike no matter what they say. Also lock it up. One time I thought mine was safe and I was gone for only 30 seconds. When I came out , it was gone but I caught them.

Somehow, these people all manage to entangle themselves into one another's lives and makes for some pretty predictable sequences and scenes.

That's the kind of film this is. It's cheesy, sentimental, substandard, and predictable. . . . and I enjoyed it.Before watching it, I had never seen an episode of the classic sitcom ''Leave it to Beaver'', from which this movie is based, but I was acquainted enough with the material to expect some Dennis the Menace type antics. And that's what I got. It's hard to figure out if the movie is winking at us; it just seems so cheerfully absurd!It basically follows the story of Beaver, a trouble-prone young boy, and his adventures and misadventures. The film's setting is in a suburban neighbourhood stuck somewhere between 1950 and 1990.Although I was really entertained, this movie's definitely not very good.But if you want a heartwarming and gentle film that's very ridiculous, you might want to check this one out.

Well, I have one question for them  Do you even watch the show?!  The 1997 movie combines countless themes and storylines from various episodes of the original series, a technique that is enjoyable and funny.  The actors are great, and it is wonderful to see some of the original show's cast making cameos in the film (such as the actors who originally played June Cleaver, Eddie Haskell, and Lumpy).  The movie gives a fresh twist to a classic television series, and effectively bridges the gap between generations.  This film is enjoyable for younger children and teens who may not have seen the original series, as well as being exciting for parents or other adults who know and love the Cleaver clan from way back in the 50s.  This film is a true winner, despite pointless criticisms that it may have received.

It regards a boy named Beaver Cleaver who wants a bike for his birthday but bad advice has him joining junior football so that his father will be impressed enough to buy it for him. Lame subplots involving Wally's difficulties with girls plus Beaver's bike stolen right in front of him because he is too stupid to know the difference. The film isn't childproof with sneaking out at night and Beaver descending a giant coffee cup after two kids take him for a fool. Then Beaver receives help after school thus lying about football practice. What parent would object to their children attempting to improve their grades? Director Andy Cadiff can be credited for its appropriate sitcom appeal but it plot is just plain dumb. Christopher McDonald and Janine Turner do their best as the otherwise standard appeal parental roles. Cameron Finley plays the dimwitted Beaver. Erik von Detten plays airhead Wally. Erika Christensen plays the female targeted for a relationship as well as being part of a film this bad. Yet another pointless sitcom to film and release to a public that never asked for it.

With knowledge of writing, I figured one writer could probably do it, but that a team would probably dilute it terribly.Four writers are listed, two as major writers, so it isn't as badly diluted as if a large team did it.And the writers did well.We have an up to date Beaver, with an up to date world, but still keeping in the story line of basic day to day life struggles, and drawing some comedy from them.If I was to nit pick, it would be at the parents. Ward and June are nothing like the old series. While the other characters seemed perfectly cast, it looked like there was an attempt to deviate from Beaumont and Billingsley in the portrayal of the parents. Hugh's Ward was not nearly the pretty boy we see in this movie. Nor was he as ill tempered. Hugh was the personification of moderation.That said, the actors were all very good. I've worked in little real life depiction films before, and each scene is extremely time consuming to film, and the more ordinary a scene appears, the more time it takes to film it. This, of course, is because Fantasy can have multiple depictions, but watching a grade school Football game is watching a grade school Football game, and less can be left to chance. In these scenes, it really looks like all the participants were very patient. Not many people realize how much tougher an innocuous movie like this is to film. I always laugh when small movie producers will be reluctant to do a Fantasy based movie because of budget, when the budget for this sort of film is set at a large scale, while one can be lax with the other.This new LEAVE IT TO BEAVER did a lot of very good things. The way the characters interwove throughout the piece was especially good. A little storybook? Not nearly so much as one would think, and no more story book than mere coincidence of all that can happen in a day will allow. It looks like the writers spent a ton of energy into interweaving the characters in the story, and came up with a very elaborate, well designed scheme.Some very well done scenes, like the skating rink, but it's not fair to single these out, because all of the scenes were well done. I won't credit the director for keeping an entire cast and crew in line, because it is the cast and crew who deserve credit for their patience. Anyone could direct a team as disciplined as this.That's not to put down the director. You have only to look at my high rating of the film to know how I feel about that. Everything was well done. I was pleasantly surprised.

His parents Ward (Christopher McDonald) and June (Janine Turner) love their younger son but are often exasperated at his failings. Older sibling, Wally (Erik Von Detten) tries to help his brother out of most scrapes. But, even delivering papers can result in disaster for the pie truck driver. When Beaver announces he is going out for football, his dad is so pleased that he gives Beaver what he wants most for his birthday, a new bike. However, a tricky older boy steals Beave's bicycle from under his nose. Ward and June are not happy. Meanwhile, Eddie Haskell continues to drop gushing compliments to all, especially Mrs. Cleaver, and convinces Wally to help him get close to a pretty girl, Karen (Erika Christensen). But, Karen has eyes for Wally. As Beaver continues to try to reclaim his bike, Wally falls for Karen, and Ward goes love-crazy when June does the house cleaning in pearls, what is ahead for the Cleaver clan? All right, I understand Beaver purists will not be happy with this screen version, for the squeaky-clean theme is not present. This is a tongue-in-cheek version, yes, so those with an open mind can give themselves a license to laugh. The opening montage, with Wally and the Beave delivering papers with disastrous results, is a keeper. So is Theodore's first day of third grade, where the teacher becomes sorry she ever asked what each student did over the summer. And, so it continues. All of the cast members are great and the script-direction is full of mirth and energy. The costumes are a hoot for they are knock-offs of fifties styles without being the genuine article and the production values are extremely high. All in all, don't be peeved at this film version of a television classic. Everyone loves the original, certainly, but most will be able to appreciate the funny send-up this flick offers the viewing audience.

Afterwards, Beaver and his brother Wally ride into town and stop by the bike shop where Beaver gazes at the shiny red bike in the window. He wanted it so much. Just then, Wally's conniving and sweet-talking friend Eddie Haskell came by and told Beaver the way to get something was to suck up to your parents like maybe joining the football team and then quitting once you got what you desired so when Ward got home that evening, Beaver announced that he would join the football team, only he soon learned that it isn't as easy as it looked but soon Beaver's birthday came. He got all sorts of cool gifts including a computer from Aunt Martha, but from Ward and June, Beaver got the bike he wanted! He was so thrilled! One afternoon, he, Wally and Eddie rode to the malt shop after school where Eddie planned to charm a girl, Karen, that he had a crush on. Wally went in with him and Beaver stayed with his bike. Just then a big kid came by and showed Beaver come cool tricks on his bike, then to Beaver's surprise, he rode off on Beaver's bike! He tried to chase him but it did no good.        Wally and Beaver were sure Ward would blow his top so when they finally told him, he was quite disappointed in Beaver then he chastised Wally for not looking out for his brother which he later took out on Beaver and the two get into a fight, causing the computer to fall out the window. Karen was having a boy-girl party and invited Wally. She invited Eddie too, reluctantly. The party was a blast. No girl wanted to kiss poor Eddie, but Wally got some action from Karen! Beaver wasn't enjoying the football team and wanted to quit but Ward wouldn't have it. When Beaver's teacher, Miss Landers, offered to stay after school and help Beaver when he began falling behind, Beaver jumped at the opportunity to help him avoid football. Wally and Karen go ice skating that night and Eddie and Beaver follow and spy on them. Karen meets with an old friend, Kyle and the two leave together. Wally left distraught and ran into Beaver and Eddie. Kyle was friends with the bully who stole Beaver's bike and when Wally, Eddie and Beaver saw him, they gave chase but he gave them the slip. Literally. He dumped a bunch of fish in their paths. To make matters worse, the next day Beaver and his friend Larry saw Kyle and the bike thief and he wanted Beaver to settle a bet. Kyle thought that the giant coffee cup atop a coffee shop had real coffee in it and his friend thought it was a machine so they asked Beaver to climb up there and see which it was. If he did it, he would get his bike back so Beaver climbed to the top of the coffee shop and peered in. Suddenly he fell into the cup and couldn't get out. The two creeps left while Larry went to get the cops.        Ward soon found out and climbed into the coffee cup with Beaver and the two had a heart-to-heart talk. Beaver decided to go back to the football team and helped his team win the big game! He saw the bike thief with the bike at the fair and gave chase. Kyle tripped Beaver but Wally shoved him into a vat of fudge. As for the bike thief, a quick thinking Beaver slammed him into a pie judging table. So in the end, Beaver got his bike back and Wally got his girl back and everyone was happy.       A pretty good film. Great family entertainment! Christopher McDonald is Ward, Janine Turner is June, Erik Von Detten is Wally and Cameron Finley as the Beaver and he was exceptionally good in his part if I do say so myself! Watch for cameos by the original June, Barbara Billingsley as Aunt Martha, and the original Eddie, Ken Osmond as Eddie's dad! So if you're a fan of the '50s TV series or you're not, I recommend Leave it to Beaver!-         "},{"Title":"Dull and directionless","Date":"23 May 2000","Score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  This is a rather unfocused movie that actually has less depth than the sitcom it's based on. For the kid who played the Beav, it seemed like they wanted all the cuteness and none of the character. The story kept throwing random bits and pieces around, mostly cliches, without tying them  together except in the most superficial ways. Scenes that should have been comedic were played by the numbers. The performances were all stiff and lifeless, with the possible exception of the Beaver. There wasn't a trace of chemistry in the entire movie. Ward was presented in a very  disjointed manner. June was completely irrelevant, as if the shallow well of the writers' ideas had run dry by the time they got to her. Eddie seemed all wrong. He should have been a Harry Flashman-like character, but in some scenes he came across as either a shy, nervous kid, or even as one of the Good Guys. The villains of the movie were only intermittently relevant to the story, and some of that seemed overly artificial and manufactured.All in all, a dull, lifeless movie.

There are far better movies out there. Nineteen ninety-seven alone gave us Fierce Creatures, Donnie Brasco, Austin Powers International Man of Mystery, The Fifth Element, Men in Black, In & Out, The Ice Storm, LA Confidential, Jackie Brown, Wag the Dog, Good Will Hunting and As Good as It Gets - and those are just the good American movies; travel outside our borders and you find The Full Monty - so there's no reason to let this one represent that year.All in all, pitiful.
