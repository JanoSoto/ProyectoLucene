It can come dangerously close to running off the rails altogether, but overall, I think it's a more successful film than the first Death Wish.The first peculiarity is that much more strongly than the first film, Death Wish II's urban crime-ridden backdrop is exaggerated to a point of caricature. Of course, there was plenty of crime in Los Angeles during this era, but not as depicted here. This is almost Broadway-style crime, with choreographed gaggles of hoodlums running out of control in designer gang-wear, making spectacles of themselves. It's over the top but serious in a way that feels uncomfortable at first, but then, that's just the point, and it helps anchor the plot developments that follow.And that plot should be no surprise to anyone who first watches Death Wish I. Death Wish II follows the plot of its predecessor as if it were a fairly rigid template. Even the events that cause Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) to take charge and clean up society's scum by his lonesome are very similar. I don't see this as a flaw here (as I don't in many other sequels that use a template approach, including series like Friday the 13th). This is a direct continuation of the story of the first film, and the similarity gives Death Wish II both a natural, logical flow and a nice symmetrical structure.Although Death Wish I had its brutal moments, Death Wish II amplifies that atmosphere and sustains it through its length. Like the films that best display gritty 1970s New York City--such as Taxi Driver (1976) and Basket Case (1982)--Death Wish II makes you feel almost dirty (in the grimy despair way, not a sexual way) while watching it. It's ironic, maybe, that Death Wish II does this so well when the setting is Los Angeles as opposed to actually being New York City, as in the first film. That director Michael Winner is able to perpetuate that atmosphere, whether by accident or design, results in the viewer being sucked into the setting and vicariously experiencing the range of unpleasant emotions felt by both the protagonists and the antagonists.Also helping on that end is the score, provided by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. Although Winner sometimes incorporates Page's music in a discordant, jarring way--over the opening credits when it fights for volume with radio banter, for example--more often than not the score gives Death Wish II a sublime, otherworldly and eerie edge. It's too bad that Page didn't go on to score many more films.This is certainly not a film to show during family time, and it's not particularly uplifting or overflowing with positive messages or socially redeeming values. But it's not trying to be any of those things. It's just a visceral (especially on an emotional level), disturbing revenge flick, and at that, it meets its goals well.

It's a movie you will either like or hate, there is no middle road here, and it makes for a great conversation piece.One final note this movie sure is a reminder and evidence that when it came to movie tough-guys Charles Bronson WAS the baddest of them all. After the sad news of Bronson's passing a lot of people say he was second behind Clint Eastwood as far as action icons go. I'm a huge Eastwood-fan but Bronson still beats him any day. It really hit me as I was watching this movie. Bronson is driving through down-town Los Angeles, after brutally executing the thug in the above mentioned scene, he passes a movie-theater and sees a guy pretending to be a cowboy outside the theater, and what is the double-billing at the theater?

Here, Bronson revenges the death of his daughter. At least her death is quick and bloodless, unlike the unpleasant rape-and-murder scene in the first film.Also, unlike the first film there is no need for a long setup. Bronson gets back in his vigilante mode in a hurry here and never lets up. If you want a short dose (an hour and a half) of action, this is your movie. One of the gang members in here, by the way, is a young Laurence Fishburne.The negatives are (1) sub-par acting performances by Bronson and his real-life wife, Jill Ireland; (2) some blatant credibility problems with the story ( such as how Bronson could get across town all bloody but never be noticed;) and (3) not exactly the most intelligent dialog!Yet, this is still an appealing movie to our conditioned satisfaction for instant revenge.

In non-fanatical, everyday reality, however, I have come to disagree with the equation above. Some would argue that ugly, violent, nihilistic, and generally misanthropic films like Death Wish and its sequels do nothing but contribute to intensifying the more unsavory impulses that lay dormant in the viewer's id.Yet therein lies the purpose of such rough-edged, unpleasant entertainment. It sparks the id, pummels it into submission, so that when the experience is over, a sigh of relief is uttered.The original Death Wish was a well-done exploitation flick with the professional gloss of an A picture; despite its relatively shallow insight into the murky moral terrain of vigilante justice, it contained an intensely subdued performance by Charles Bronson, and confident direction by Michael Winner.By comparison, Death Wish 2 is a typical sequel, taking what the original had and dumbing it down to milk some cash for the franchise. In addition to Bronson (in the role of architect Paul Kersey), a few other characters return to provide at least a superficial connection to the original (Robin Sherwood as his daughter; Vincent Gardenia as the cop that uncovered his identity). The plot is as before Paul Kersey has begun a new life (courting the cheerfully cardboard Jill Ireland) which is shattered when a gang of punks (including a young Laurence Fishburne) rape and murder his housekeeper and daughter. Unlike the original, no time is spent watching Kersey contemplate his actions; he simply goes to work, and in the process is rendered a stoic killing machine. The characterization/motivation for the punks is given even less thought--they exist for the sole purpose of showing how scummy the scummiest scum of society can be. The film moves from one random encounter to the next, wherein Kersey stumbles across gang members and kills them.Of course this doesn't sound like highbrow film-making, but Death Wish 2 never teases the audience with any notions of greatness. In spite of the meager attention given to Kersey's character, we root for him anyway; and in spite of the inexplicably-written punks, we hope for their demise. Michael Winner once again gives the film a gritty yet polished look, though he is clearly directing a flat-out B picture; the pacing is tight (the film runs just under 90 minutes), and the action is competently choreographed (though the romantic subplot provides a respite from the relentless violence, it is shallow and cloying). Jimmy Page's offbeat musical score only adds to the unusual charge this film packs.In the best-case scenario, Death Wish 2 is no masterpiece, but the perfect Novocaine to apply after a particularly rotten day. It will numb you into a state of apathy and wash your troubles away (that's a compliment).

I found no insight in this film, all I found was an awesome character who you can't get enough of that gets away with killing pieces of trash that rape, mug, and murder civilians.

I must admit that this is an interesting movie psychologically, but I don't think any five penny analysts could do anything to these sick people. Everybody is sick in this movie. It has the overall feeling of some really cheap low-life bar The feeling of disappointment and failure in life. I would say it's the overall feeling of death; This movie feels like you would have just heard, that you have an incurable cancer. It's an interesting fact that Charles Bronson is, or at least has been, some kind of popular action hero He looks like a disappointed- and tired-to-everything alcoholic. An interesting world-view and feeling. There is NO humor, joy or hope in this film; Not even before the bad guys come and ruin it all. The bad guys names tell all Nirvana, Stomper, Cutter, Punkcut, Jiver. They are the bad guys, and nothing else. They even smoke the herb and become psychotic and aggressive killer-madmen after that! I didn't know that that stuff makes that, but it's always good to learn. The bad guys first dance, chill out and have fun, and all of the sudden start to rape and kill people. (After that they forget about it.) It seems that the main character (Bronson) is a real psychopath, at least he fits perfectly of the description of one. I have to correct what I said before Not everybody is totally sick in this movie; Just the ones that are involved in THE WAR. There is some (very few) good-looking pictures in this film; for example when the antihero walks in the streets at night. It's funny how he judges people that are unknown to him For example when he sees somebody drinking alcohol, he looks at him with an expression of total repulsion on his face. Some police story also goes in the background, but it doesn't have much to do with the movie.But after all, this film manages to represent some peoples (the filmmakers) very strong feelings, and evidently also the feelings of many viewers, and isn't that one of the main purposes of any piece of art or self-expression? Can you judge people for how they feel? If you want to see a really good movie of this genre (revenge-moral-story), I strongly recommend Tony Scott's Man on Fire (2004)(with Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Dakota Fanning).

Tragedy is never far from this man's door.When a particularly loathsome quintet of punks rapes his daughter, and she dies in an escape attempt, Kersey is once again motivated to mete out brutal vigilante justice. When the LA cops realize what's happening, they consult the cops in NYC, knowing what happened there, and since the authorities in NYC opted never to prosecute Kersey, they have to send out detective Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia reprises his role) to help cover their asses.While the screenplay, by David Engelbach, is not exactly believable, the belated sequel Death Wish II is still incredibly effective on a visceral level. Even in its cut, R rated version, it's a pretty merciless, mean-spirited exercise in sleaze. Director Michael Winner, who directed the memorable first film and who would also direct the next sequel, keeps the action coming and the pace consistent. It's always a vicarious pleasure to watch a relentless bad ass like Bronson give cinematic scum the vicious comeuppance that they all deserve.And the gang this time are monumentally creepy; hulking Thomas Duffy stands out as ringleader Nirvana, who proves very tough to take down when the cops move in on him. Laurence Fishburne is another member of the gang, but he has very few lines. Other familiar faces add to the enjoyment Anthony Franciosa, J.D. Cannon, Ben Frank, Robert F. Lyons, Drew Snyder, Paul Lambert, Paul Comi, Charles Cyphers, and Roberta Collins, while the love of Bronson's real life Jill Ireland is his love interest, a journalist doing a piece on methods of dealing with violence.With a blistering music score by Jimmy Page blasting away on the soundtrack, and much effective use of L.A. locations, this is intense stuff, and offers up some choice sequences. One of course has Bronson meeting with one of the thugs and promising the young man that he will be meeting Jesus shortly. The other has him intervening as a man and woman are being assaulted, and when they're being interrogated later, they sing his praises to the consternation of the investigating detective (Frank).Understandably, this entry in the series may be too tough for some people to take, but those who delight in seamy vigilante cinema are sure to find viewing this a pleasure.

The protagonist, middle-class architect Paul Kersey, has moved from New York to Los Angeles and put his vigilante past behind him. The final stage in his healing should be the reintegration of his damaged daughter into his life and the wider society and his marriage to a socially conscious radio reporter Geri Nichols (Jill Ireland, Bronson's wife in reality). Yet lightning strikes twice as his doting maid and the recovering daughter are raped and murdered by a gang of street thugs and Kersey becomes a vigilante again, taking out the members of the gang one-by-one. To paraphrase Wilde, to have your daughter raped once, Mr Kersey, may be regarded as a misfortune; to have it happen again looks like carelessness&#x85; Nevertheless, this rather contrived inciting incident gives Winner the opportunity to create a film which, whilst it is certainly sensationalistic, offers a provocative challenge to viewers, whether they be bleeding heart liberals or string 'em up reactionaries. Kersey heads to the streets, disguised in working class casual labourer get-up, takes a room in a two-bit dive which he uses as a base for his revenge. This hotel is opposite and above two sparsely populated inner-city missions, from which emanate Christian prayers, preaching and hymns, looking to save the souls of the society's criminal classes and dregs. Kersey intends to get to them first. His initial revenge killing here features the cold-blooded summary execution of a young blonde thug who wears an ostentatious cross; Kersey asks him do you believe in Jesus? and the thug nods yes; Kersey ripostes well you're going to meet him now and blows him away the young man's chance at redemption for his sins has been taken from him. Rat are shown scuttling away and the film asks, are the criminal classes mere vermin to be cleaned off the streets or have they souls which can be saved? The association between Kersey's prey and animal life is continued later when he wounds one, tracking the young man by means of his blood trail.The film also contrasts Kersey's actions with an argument for criminal rehabilitation. Geri is researching the methods by which a criminologist doctor has been rehabilitating offenders and, by another ripe coincidence, the final member of the gang ends up in the doctor's clinic. Bronson inveigles his way in and metes out death to the perpetrator, by means of electrocution. An orderly who works at the clinic catches him and lets him go. There is a class argument being enacted, whereby working class men support Kersey and middle-class do-gooders think they know a better way. The film heavily weighs the argument in Kersey's favour by showing the thugs as barely human scum but the visceral nature of the debate as portrayed is food for thought. Kersey hardly ends up rewarded for his actions &#x96; he loses Gina and is little more than the ghost of a man haunting his regular middle-class lifestyle by the film's close. The idea that Kersey is making himself a shadow of his former social self is portrayed on screen by some nicely done expressionist cinematography.The film's argument is problematized further by the graphic portrayal of the violence, especially the sexual violence meted out to Rosario, Kersey's maid. A long, drawn-out gang rape plays out on screen, with the stripped woman whipped and humiliated by laughing goons &#x96; there's an extent to which Winner (and his core audience) is revelling with them in their sexual sadism. If, ultimately, the film's makers and viewers are of the same bent as the criminals, then their siding with Kersey is very much a personal death wish.

There is no pretence about this film, whereas the original Death Wish painstakingly presented Paul Kersey as a victim of violence who had been pushed to breaking point, Death Wish 2 finds him in John Rambo territory, as a borderline crazy person bent on revenge. Unlike the original, Death Wish 2 has no political message and never waivers in its approval of Paul's vigilantism. While this is by no means as good as the original, which I consider to be a minor classic, Death Wish 2 is a great example of the short lived early 80s embrace of ultra violent entertainment before these kind of movies were labelled video nasties and expelled from the mainstream.The main reason why the Death Wish series became increasingly ridiculous is the improbability of one man suffering so much bad luck. This time around a group of thugs break into Paul's home and gang rape his Latina maid. This scene is truly grim and more detailed than most of the more infamous rape & revenge movies of the 80s. The scene is particularly distasteful as poor Rosario gets roughed up so much worse than any other female victim in the series - all of whom happen to be white. Unfortunately, I don't think that it is a coincidence, as the entire Death Wish series had dubious racial undertones.The action becomes increasing twisted when Paul's daughter, Carol, still traumatised from the attack in the original film, is kidnapped and raped. The nastiness of this act stems mostly from the creepy smile on Carol's face. When Carol is subsequently impaled on an iron gate, the transformation from the socially aware film of the 1970s to the sleazy, pure action of the 80s sequel is complete. This time around Paul doesn't even bother with the police, choosing instead to take all of the thugs out himself.The second half of the film is fairly predictable and a bit slow in comparison with the downright nastiness of the opening half an hour. Paul walks around the streets of LA (he definitely gets around), shooting muggers, rapists and his daughter's attackers. This time around Paul doesn't hesitate shooting anyone and the conflict he demonstrated in the first film is nowhere to be seen. Instead, everyone from civilians to the police comment approvingly on his particular approach to crime control. Needless to say, Death Wish 2 is about as politically incorrect as they come and yet, endearingly of its time.Michael Winner does a good job of capturing the atmosphere of early 80s LA, with amusing glimpses of religious fanatics, coke dealers and general crazies. The 80s fashion on display is pretty funny and the scene where the thugs dance to their ghettoblaster makes me laugh every time. The acting is highlighted by Jill Ireland's extraordinarily wooden turn as Paul's new girlfriend. Her ability to lower the tone of any Charles Bronson movie borders on the supernatural. Lastly, Jimmy Page's soundtrack deserves a mention, it is different to say the least.If you are looking for cheap, nasty, morally corrupt entertainment, then you should enjoy Death Wish 2. I certainly did.

The film is dark and grainy, the characters are too broadly drawn, and there are some disgusting acts of violence. There are a couple good shootouts however, and it's always nice to see Bronson dish out his own brand of justice.Our story picks up a few years after the events of part one. Bronson has relocated in Los Angeles and is working as an architect and currently redesigning a radio station building. His daughter is living close by in an institution. She is still greatly disturbed by her traumatic rape in the last film. She can venture out in public under the supervision of her father, but she still cannot speak. On one such trip, Bronson, his daughter, and his girlfriend (Ireland) get into an altercation with a gang of five muggers. The muggers steal Bronson's wallet and find out where he lives. They then show up at his place and... help the maid prepare dinner.Well, that isn't quite what happens. This is a Michael Winner film, and nobody does rape scenes like Michael Winner. In one of the most shocking scenes ever found in a mainstream film, the house keeper is repeatedly raped be these creeps. Depending on the version you see, the rape lasts from only a couple minutes to nearly fifteen minutes! This film has been cut to ribbons by editors over the years as each station has their own idea of just how much of it they want to show you. Anyway, Bronson and his daughter eventually show up at the house where he is beaten and left for dead while his daughter is kidnapped by the punks. In another tasteless scene, his mute and helpless daughter is also raped and then jumps to a gruesome death from a window. I think that scene is really a lot worse than the housekeeper scene.Of course you know where we're headed. Bronson goes on the war path and tracks these five creeps and their associates down and blows them away. Not only are there some neat shootouts, but also a few good one-liners along the way. If you can get through the brutality of the first half hour, you will enjoy seeing Bronson do what he does best.Bronson's performance is calm and dignified like always. There are two outstanding supporting performances by Vincent Gardenia and Jill Ireland. They share a wonderful scene together as Gardenia (hot on Bronson's trail like in part one) questions Ireland about Bronson's whereabouts at night. He also informs her of Bronson's history of killing muggers in the Big Apple which leads to a hilarious scene between Bronson and Ireland later on. And YES... that is THE Laurence Fishburne as one of the muggers. He's the one Bronson shoots in the head through a radio. You'll have to see it to understand what I'm referring to.One may be tempted to defend this film by saying that yeah, it's pretty nasty, but so is real life crime! I won't deny that, but I don't buy the argument here. This film with its broad caricatures of street hoods, and no less than three sexual assaults is really just a piece of exploitation. The film does have its good moments, and apparently enough of them for it to gross 16 million dollars and spawn several more sequels. But Death Wish II is really not going to impress anyone who isn't a rabid fan of Charles Bronson. I would strongly urge anyone and everyone to take a look at part 3, though! That film is an absolute blast! 5 of 10 for Death Wish II. So sayeth the Hound.

Charles Bronson resumes his role as urban vigilante Paul Kersey who sets out to kill the youth gang who rape then kill his maid and his mentally handicapped daughter. This is a graphically violent film that manages to appal and entertain in equal measure.WARNING!!! PLOT SPOILER!!! THE FOLLOWING LINES DESCRIBE THE MOST MEMORABLE SCENE IN THE FILM. READING THIS MAY SPOIL THE FILM. EXTREMELY VIOLENT SCENES ARE ALSO DESCRIBED IN DETAIL AS I FEEL DETAILED DESCRIPTION IS CRITICAL TO MY REVIEW.Death Wish 2 is a VERY violent film. In fact I found some of the violence in Death Wish 2 very hard to take. The biggest problem with Death Wish 2 is the scene where Bronsons maid, is brutally gang raped by the youth gang. This is the most violent, brutal rape scene I have seen. THIS SCENE WILL SHOCK EVERYBODY! This scene seems to serve no purpose but to titillate and includes the seediest line of dialogue which I have ever heard. When one of the gang is about to rape the maid over the sitting room couch he is told by the gang leader that if he wants her he can take her to bed.This begins a horrible sequence where the maid is flung onto the bed and subjected to a very lengthy, hot, sweaty brutal gang rape in which she bleeds from her privates (a detail missing from the current video versions but intact on older American tapes which were uncut). This scene is unwatchable and really sick. You get the sense that the reason the makers have chosen to depict the rape a very busty and sexy middle aged foreign woman is to appeal to the older woman fantasies of older teens at whom this film seems aimed. The rape scene is made even worse by the fact that I found the actress who plays the maid, Silvana Gallardo to be one of the most beautiful, sexy women I have seen on screen. She is the only decent actor/actress in the movie. Its a shame that she never moved onto better projects than this. The rest of the film is nothing but more graphic depictions of shootings, impalings and rape which are moderately entertaining in a morbid way. Charles Bronson gives one of his weakest performances which detracts from the impact of the films horrific content. Being a fan of ultra-violent movies I did find some entertainment value in Death Wish 2 but could not  stomach the despicable manner in which an act of horrific sexual violence was depicted as raw, titillation. Very nasty indeed. If you are easily shocked steer well clear of this film!   "},{"Title":"DW2 is a gut wrenching, stomach turning yet immorally thrilling sequel.","Date":"27 October 2011","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Death Wish 2 is even worse than what its title suggests, and that is something that has never happened to me while I watched its other sequels. (The absolutely gung-ho 3, the fun 4, the final 5). With sequences that seems to be at home in movies like Forced Entry or I Spit on Your Grave, Death Wish 2 is definitely not your ordinary vigilante movie, dealing with themes and graphic imagery that would make the newer, cleaner vigilante movies like Death Sentence feel like Terms Of Endearment.In Death Wish 2, it's not all about the violence that makes it sick, it's the unhealthy anticipation for it to happen, both referring to the two brutal rapes/murders and the vigilante justice that precedes them. Credit goes to Michael Wimmer for portraying this to the utmost degree, making the calm before the storm as unbearable as the actual storm itself. In here, he beautifully shows us the peaceful and hopeful life that has befallen Paul Kersey (Bronson) ever since the events of the first film; he now has a new job in Los Angeles, his daughter has shown signs of recovery from her trauma in the first film and of course there's the obligatory love interest (Jill Ireland Who Else?). All of that is destroyed when a group of totally immoral, evil, horny, violent and downright nasty punks (one of them being Laurence Fishburne) do a nasty house invasion, with Bronson's Latina housemaid being the first victim. Needless to say, she becomes the subject of as-nasty-as I Spit on your grave gang-rape. Not long after, the daughter gets it too, with the aggravating fact that the gang engage in the rape of a mentally retarded woman. She then gets an even nastier fate; she gets brutally impaled on a fence spikes while trying to escape them.Now you wonder why I had to go further in describing the sordid details of the movie. The simple answer to that question is that is it those scenes that serve as the engine of the entire juggernaut of a movie, the driving force behind all the well deserved-vigilante killings. If the first one tried to shy away from the cause of Kersey's outrage, here it splashes it on your unbelieving face. But to my great surprise the effect of these events seem less on Kersey himself. Instead of going down on his knees and trashing on the floor, he remains calm, stoic and as determined to kill. And where does that leave the viewer? Taking the emotional brunt not experienced by Kersey, they silently cheer him on as he proceeds to brutally wipe out the gang responsible.Like what I said above, this is the Death Wish that fully indulges itself in the cathartic need of the people to dish out vengeance on people who deserve it. This film succeeds because it is very successful in creating that need and reinforcing it at the same time with the acts of brutality found in the second part of the film. I also said that it is immorally thrilling because of the entire nature of the film itself. The rapes are presented in a graphic and voyeuristic manner that while some people might turn their eyes from it, some will be confused as to whether they will enjoy it or not. If anything, it adds to the bleak nature of the film, a crude way of making the viewers participants in the atrocities.Overall, a great cross of a vigilante thriller and an exploitation movie. Only thing that mars this movie is its attempt in making a romantic angle. But then again it fails in the movie, a clear indication that viewers came to see the rapes and the muggings and Charles Bronson killing those responsible one by one.

The Big Apple authorities knew that they would fare better if they ran Kersey out of town rather than prosecuted him. At fade-out in Death Wish, our protagonist is shown helping a lady in Chicago after some miscreants bully her. Kersey smiles and makes a pistol of his fingers and aims it at them. When Death Wish 2 opens, our hero is residing in Los Angeles. He is having a relationship with Geri Nichols (Jill Ireland of Cold Sweat) who works in radio news at the station he is designing. Although a lot of time had transpired between the time that Death Wish (1974) came out and this belated sequel (1982), director Michael Winner does his best to bridge the years by getting actors like Vincent Gardenia and J.D. Cannon to reprise their roles. The action seems twice as brutal. Kersey daughter is raped by a gang of low-lifers. Afterward, she impales herself on a fence spike. The same sleazy dastards assault Kersey's housekeeper and rape her. These scenes will undoubtedly mortify the squeamish. Laurence Fishburne plays one of the punks who tangles with Bronson. Jimmy Page's rock music soundtrack adds a touch of atmosphere to these grim event. Basically, Death Wish 2 is the apex of the franchise. Death Wish 3 was virtually a battleground with no memorable characters. J. Lee Thompson took over the helming duties on Death Wish 4 and it veers from the formula enough to make it seem optional as a Death Wish movie.

Whatever the restaurant critic, boulevardier and occasional film-maker spent the eight year interim doing, he certainly can't have been brainstorming, because this is little more than a rehash of the first movie, with a couple of twists. Firstly, this one takes place in Los Angeles rather than New York, which hurts the atmosphere somewhat. Secondly, because this is a sequel and has a Roman numeral after the title, someone has decided that it makes sense to have twice as much on-screen unpleasantness. And you know where this review is heading, right? THAT scene in which Bronson - the only man alive who could have the bad luck to get mugged whilst queueing for a Cornetto - finds that the horror that befell his family in the Big Apple has followed him to the City of Angels. I have a soft spot for trash cinema and exploitative sleaze in general - I grew up during the video boom in England, and a lot of the first films I saw were entertainingly dreadful, so you could say I acquired the taste early - but the gang rape scene is so lurid, prurient and revolting, especially in its uncut form (I found a precert copy of this film in a thrift shop), that it's well-nigh unwatchable. Not only that, there's absolutely no reason for its inclusion in the film other than to make the bad guys even badder and to rub the audience's nose in the grime. It's horribly out of kilter with the outrageous (bordering on ridiculous) shoot-'em-up carnage that follows, as is a similarly disturbing scene in which Bronson's mute daughter is raped (again - remember the first film?) before jumping through a (closed) window to her death, a messy and graphic impaling on metal railings. This is Winner going for broke, playing naughty boy games with the censors, and the fact that the BBFC cut three minutes out of the cinema release couldn't have hurt the publicity drive one bit. Video was uncensored in England until 1984, so the first home release wasn't subject to such officious meddling, and I can only wonder how the 'lucky punters' who bought this thing after seeing it in the cinemas reacted. I'm guessing, however, that they didn't just mutter I didn't see that bit at the ABC and leave it at that! Once you get past the opening salvo of misogynist sleaze, however, DEATH WISH II turns out to be (whisper it) pretty good fun, in a mindless, hideous, crowd-pleasing way. The violent thugs are lined up and shot down in the manner of an arcade game, Bronson is his reassuringly hard-faced, hard-assed self and it's all unrealistic enough to put a decent amount of distance between the on-screen carnage and the viewer. There's also a goodly amount of cheese for connoisseurs, such as the hilarious 'street' dance moves from the ghetto blaster-toting freaks, drug dealers straight from central casting, a FACES OF DEATH-style electrocution, rubbish dialogue from all and sundry and Jimmy Page's bizarre score which alternates between faux-classical passages, ear-splitting string-bending and weird electronic swoops...hang on, it's Spinal Tap! Let's hear it for Derek Smalls, he wrote this! In all seriousness, DEATH WISH II is a hard film to like. The rape scenes make it objectionable almost from the get-go, and the set-up for Bronson's second bite at the revenge apple is revoltingly overdone by anyone's standards. Technically, it's about average, with Winner's restless direction taking in some bizarre set-ups and disorientating editing along the way, and most of the performances are flat enough to be medically classed as comatose. But if you're in the mood to see predatory hooligans wasted in various nasty ways, the final hour may be diverting enough to give you a few chuckles on a slow night. Just don't say I didn't warn you.

His daughter has been released from hospital, although she's still in a semi-catatonic state. Kersey has a new love interest and a housekeeper and everything seems to be going OK for Kersey. However, when Kersey's wallet becomes stolen after he's been mugged, the gang find address confirmation in Kersey's wallet and proceed to Kersey's home where they kill his housekeeper and kidnap his daughter and then kill her. Following these events, Kersey goes back to his old ways and sets about tracking down the gang of muggers.I think what I liked about Death Wish 2 is the fact that it is more focused than the first film. The narrative in the first film was shaky to say the least and I found that the events in the second half never really connected with what had happened in the first half - he killed lots of would be muggers, but never seemed to pursue those that perpetrated the original crime against his wife and daughter which never made any sense to me. Thankfully, with this film it's much more straight forward - Kersey goes after the muggers that killed his wife and daughter and that's all there is to this film and it's this straight forward and focused plot that makes this a stronger film. Like the first film, it's quite graphic and brutal, but again this does give the film a very realistic feel to it. As a direct result of the stronger narrative it ultimately means that the film flows much better and it never really gets to a point where it becomes boring.The only real glaring weakness I could find with this film lay with Jill Ireland; I felt that her acting was a bit wooden and her character was probably one of the most bland characters that I've ever seen. I also never really bought into their romance either. Thankfully, her character and their romance don't make that much of an impact on the film and Winner mostly just allows Bronson to do his 'thing' which was perfectly OK with me.One final thing I'll say about this sequel is don't be put off by its current rating of 5.9. It's an underrated sequel which is much better than its rating suggests. If you liked the first film then you will like this film. As for me, I preferred it to the first film, but I know I'm in the minority on that one. "},{"Title":"Do You Believe in Jesus ?

Despite all the differing opinions posted here, everyone agrees on one thing - Death Wish 2 is a very violent film.  It starts out with a bunch of punks stealing Paul Kersey's (Charles Bronson's) wallet. Since Kersey roughed one of them up, they get Kersey's home address from his wallet and break into his house.  No one is home except for Rosario the  maid.The scene of Rosario being gang raped is extremely graphic, brutal and horrifying.  There are 3 different versions of this.  A heavily-censored broadcast TV version, the 1982 theatrical release and the uncut version that has recently been shown on Cable TV,  which makes the theatrical release seem tame.  This is not for the squeamish. It shows each one of the 5 punks having their turn with Rosario.  She is degraded and brutalized.  One of these lowlifes takes off his belt and spanks her while another is raping her.  Kersey's daughter is also brutalized but this scene is spooky because she is near catatonic since the original film and is almost unaware of what is happening to her.  Her escape attempt leads to her death.Well, that being said, I like this movie.  I think the earlier scenes, though quite violent, are necessary for depicting these 5 gang members for what they are - unfeeling, merciless, psychopathic bastards whose redeeming qualities add up to zilch.  So, can you blame Paul Kersey for wanting his revenge?  Let's face it, his wife was murdered in the first film, his daughter was raped in both films and dies in this one. It seems that Kersey is quite justified in wanting to go after these creeps. Also, I thought his acting was quite good.  Instead of playing some angry, over-the-top character (as William Shatner is famous for doing), Bronson becomes intropspective, cold and calculating.I recommend this film for fans of action pictures.  You really want Charles Bronson's character to track down those sleazeball criminals.  Some people feel that this film is unnecessarily violent.

In a scenario almost exactly like the first film, he gets his wallet stolen from him by some muggers, and they use it to find out where he lives. When they go to Paul's house, they murder his housekeeper, and then, his poor daughter gets raped again, only this time, she's killed. Paul then goes back into vigilante mode, only this time, he does not target random muggers, instead focusing his wrath upon the five who killed his daughter and housekeeper.A sequel to the original, Death Wish II is a thrilling film that is an exceptionally effective follow up to the classic original. Considering how much I enjoyed the first film, I thought that I would also watch the other films in the series, and I have to say that I enjoyed this one too. Although this film is darker and seemingly a little more violent than the first film, it is a very good follow up. While its not as good as the original (which is understandable, considering how it is usually hard to top the original film in a film series), it still has many things about it that makes it worth a viewing or two, and it's always a pleasure to see Charles Bronson take down bad guys.Reprising his role from the original film, Charles Bronson is as good as he's ever been. In this film, Paul has a vengeance that is definitely more personal than his last one. This time around, he has five specific targets, the ones who have caused him to once again lose everything that he holds dear to him. While all five films have Paul seeking some kind of vengeance, this film seems to be the most personal of the five. I give kudos to writer David Engelbach for doing this, as it makes Paul a more sympathetic character and one that we will definitely want to see come out victorious.In addition to Bronson being his usual great self, the supporting cast deserves some mention too. Jill Ireland (who was Bronson's wife at the time) was very good in her role as Bronson's love interest in this film, and their chemistry really showed in many scenes. Vincent Gardenia returns from the first film, reprising his role as Det. Frank Ochoa, who arrives from New York to once again be on the tale of the vigilante. Bronson, Ireland, and Gardenia did the best work in the film, out everyone who appeared in the film, these three stood out the most.Also returning from the first film is director Michael Winner, who gives this movie the same kind of edge that he gave the first film. Winner also manages to keep the ominous tones that the previous movie had, giving a real sense of danger. In many scenes in the movie, where Paul is out on the streets at night, there is a sense of dread which gives the feeling that danger could be anywhere, and considering what the movie is about, it could be anywhere. Winner didn't quite achieve the same level of success as he did with the original Death Wish, but in my books, this one certainly manages to do good with that it has.Like the previous film, this movie contains quite a lot of violence in it. Mostly the break in and rape scenes in the beginning, and then of course, Paul going out on his vigilante spree. And similar to the previous film, if you are somebody who gets rather uncomfortable at the sight of gratuitous violence, then you might want to be careful, as this movie has a lot of it, and it gets pretty graphic in a couple of scenes. And lastly, considering how good he was at playing these kind of roles, it is always a pleasure to see Charles Bronson take out bad guys one after another.All in all, if you enjoyed Death Wish, then there's a good chance that you will also enjoy Death Wish II. Although it isn't as great as the aforementioned film, it still has many things going for it. And also, it's worth watching if you are a fan of Charles Bronson. Personally, while I am a big fan of Bronson, that doesn't always mean that I am predestined to like everything that he's in. I have seen some of his movies that I like more than others, but I haven't seen one yet that I intensely disliked. In short, Death Wish II is a worth sequel to the original vigilante classic, it's worth seeing.9/10 "},{"Title":"As good as DW 1","Date":"20 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" A grossly underrated movie , as good as the first , and a far cry from 3 and 4 .

Some critics seem to regard the rapes as especially lurid , perhaps purposefully titillating , but I could not disagree more . Rape is not pretty, and regardless of the attractiveness of the two rape victims , one must really have a sick mind to find those scenes titillating .

Plot follows a familiar trajectory, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is now in Los Angeles living a normal life, when wouldn't you know it, some scumbag youths cross his path after administering some rape and pillage on folk close to him...The problem here, and the reason why some critics positively burst blood vessels after watching it, is that for the first half it just is pure exploitation, this in spite of some decent production value. Did it really need to be another sex crime? Could it not have been a murder et al? There gets a point in the film where you sense it's boobs for boobs sake. Though you have to wonder if Winner dared to ask Chuck and Jill Ireland (playing girlfriend of Chuck...) if Jill would do a nude scene? I think a broken nose may have come about if that subject had of been broached...Once Kersey (Bronson hard as nails again) goes about dealing out his brand of justice, the film hits its straps, teasing the viewers with moral - cum - ethical outrage or conversely, vicarious thinking. Vigilante films are always going to swim in tricky waters, provoking anger and heated debate from all walks of the political spectrum, but better to have them out there to provoke a response than not. Surely?There is nothing remotely high end here, but it's a film worthy of its above average rating on IMDb. It can shock, annoy, dismay and even induce unintentional mirth (three of the rapist thugs dance the campiest dance ever), but it will not be ignored and people are still seeking it out today to watch for the first time. Michael Winner still showing the ability to pique interest with his vigilante franchise. 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"A Good Crime-Thriller Sequel","Date":"20 October 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Death Wish II is just as haunting and good as the first film.

I will give fair warning It is extremely violent/graphic - there is murder and rape within the film.I saw this movie when it first came out - I was 10 years old. This movie has haunted me ever since I first saw it.

It's a big difference between the too, but it still works. Bronson's character Paul Kersey could do anything from shooting unarmed thugs at point-blank range to electrocuting a mental patient and you'd still like him.Or feel sorry for him. Sort of both in this case.Anyone close to Kersey dies. His daughter, who barely managed to survive the first film, was unfortunate enough to once again get attacked, kidnapped, and eventually killed off. Their housemaid was also a victim, and she didn't survive either--she arguably got the worst of it (though honestly I don't know which is worse getting bludgeoned to death or impaling yourself on a fence). This sets Kersey once again on a journey for revenge through the greasy slums of L.A., and this time he DOES find those who are responsible for the attack. They're determined to get away, but Kersey won't let the culprits who are actually responsible for attacking his loved ones get away with it this time (which is good because that was the most unsatisfying aspect of Part I).This sequel is louder, more action-y, more violent, and a little more sillier. It transforms the drama/revenge franchise into an action/revenge franchise, and it manages to be entertaining despite having even less of a plot than the first one (if that's even possible). Charles Bronson plays the character well, and the action scenes are fantastic and a step above Part I's, which is good because that's just about all this movie has going for it.It's not the worst installment in the series, but it's close. Luckily though, good ol' Bronson keeps this movie from becoming a cringeworthy sequel that, while inferior, is still quite a bit of fun to watch (in a really sick way).The uncut version is the best way to see this, just like the rest of them. It's harder to watch, but it gives you a better idea of how nasty the villains are and it helps justify even the cruelest of Kersey's actions.

This time Paul Kersey guns down muggers in L.A. rather than New York, but it's all dark alleys so it looks the same anyway. This sequel is definitely harsher than the original though, the Paul Kersey that started gagging after his first kill is long gone here. He's a full-blown angel of vengeance now, even carefully putting in some quips like Do you believe in Jesus? Well, you're gonna meet him. Because it's the same story you don't really feel much creative force, but I've got to say this one easily has the best scene in the entire franchise. Or rather, the most disturbing scene. The part where Kersey's mute daughter (a strong performance by the otherwise completely unknown Robin Sherwood) is raped is so uneasy, so bizarre, so awkward to look at that it will always be the first scene that comes to mind when I think of the Death Wish-series. I also enjoy how Kersey actually goes after those particular culprits rather than just kill random punks like in the first one (how the hell does he find them so easily though?) This sequel might give you some feelings of deja-vu, but it's definitely still very good. "},{"Title":"Brutal but compelling","Date":"11 August 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Death Wish 2 is perhaps the most infamous of the sequels in the series. If you're (un)fortunate enough to view the uncut version of the movie, you'll be treated to two somewhat drawn out rape sequences that will likely have you questioning the sanity of the movie's director, Michael Winner. And even in the cut American and European releases, these scenes are still fairly unpleasant to watch (and the cuts leave more to the imagination, which may be better or worse depending on your point of view). However, that is exactly the point. The thugs who commit these vile acts are left without any sympathy, dehumanized completely and thus ensuring that when they do gain their comeuppance it is extremely satisfying. In a sense, the brutality that Charles Bronson's character Paul Kersey enacts against them is practically justified.Death Wish 2 does away with much of the social commentary featured in the first movie, so any statements made about urban decay, vigilantism and/or gun control are pretty much absent this time around. The series is yet to cross over into full-blown action movie territory as seen in Death Wish 3, but the action contained within Death Wish 2 is generally well done and fairly memorable. The (low-budget) grimy and generally dreary look to the whole movie, complemented by a soundtrack of brooding synthesizer riffs by Jimmy Page gives Death Wish 2 an overall feel that not too many movies manage to achieve, and that's a feel of utter despair. Los Angeles here is depicted as a crime-ridden hell-hole, even more so than the rendition of New York City in the previous movie.Yet, despite the griminess, there are some amusing oddities. The gangsters in Death Wish 2 are almost laughable caricatures, outfitted in clothes that look as if they were purchased from a store that specializes in the most stereotypical street-thug gear imaginable. The violence, despite its brutality, is often punctuated by what I can only call 'Bronsonian' moments, including the oft-quoted 'You believe in Jesus?' one-liner, or the more succinct 'Goodbye' that Charles Bronson delivers to one of the thugs before enacting vengeance. The shootout in the park towards the end of the movie is memorable, if only because of how over-the-top it gets. One thug gets the bright idea of holding his ghetto blaster in front of his face, as if he thinks it'll stop bullets. Charles Bronson quickly proves him wrong.As an action movie, Death Wish 2 certainly delivers.

After his maid is brutally gang raped and his comatose daughter ends her comatose state (but not in a good way), Kersey decides to re-awaken his inner-Hulk. Having established himself in a red-light district of the city, he prowls the alleyways in search of target practice. One by one he exacts merciless revenge on those responsible for his grievances. You believe in Jesus Christ? he remarks at thug #2s (Kevin Major Howard) crucifix chain, adding well, you're gonna meet him before peppering his body with lead. Despite the high work rate, he manages to court radio personality (Mrs Bronson), while his old foe (Vincent Gardenia) has also returned to cash-in on the pay dirt that is Death Wish 2.Aside from the reverberating guitar sounds of Jimmy Page, there are a number of other peculiarities to this film. Apart from the three principles, everyone else featured is a virtual bit part or cameo. Furthermore, director Winner has employed a frenetic narrative pace, loaded with blistering scene interchanges and at times, nonsensical editing. The result is a mosaic of sex and violence, punctuated by perverse attempts to rationalise through rough justice and false sympathy.From all the attempts at social commentary, there's but one message to take from this film - beware the sequel. Bronson is one-dimensional and Ireland merely a patch of green scenery amid the blood stains. Acting kudos goes to the always alluring Roberta Collins - she plays 'woman at party', a brief but dignified role in the context of this film. Having said this, if you thrive on gratuitous sleaze, have secret vigilante ideation's, or just worship Charles Bronson, then Death Wish 2 could be your cup of tea.

Which Winner also made the original film. Nearly none of the strong impact of the first movie is there. It's nearly played for unintentional laughs and it is often very silly. Bronsan looks bored here, he certainly did the role for the money. Vincent Gardenia, who was in the original as Detective Frank Ochoa is back in a supporting role. Ireland, who was real-life wife of Bronson.Still, fans of the Death Wish features will find some entertainment here. The lead thugs are recognizable, especially a young Kevyn Major Howard (Best known for his supporting roles in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and Alien Nation) and Laurence Fishburne. He gets the biggest unintentional laughter in the movie, when Fishburne tries to shield himself from a shooting with a Boombox! Charles Cyphers (Who best known in supporting roles in John Carpenter's movies like  Assault on Precient 13, The Fog and Halloween) appears as The Head Orderly during the last act of the picture.

Having somewhat recovered from her rape at the hands of thugs who killed her mother, Kersey's daughter is trying to pick up the pieces with her pops, but when LA produces some more slime who sexually molest the poor girl again, she can not take it and commits suicide. This pushes Kersey over the edge and he will exact his own brand of justice. I imagine director Michael Winner's sequel will push some buttons as Kersey's wallet is stolen by no-good hoods who seem to exist for the sole purpose to terrorize and harm. The gang intrude upon Kersey's home and savagely rape his maid, knock him unconscious when he comes home, and kidnaps his daughter. What's repulsive about this particular movie is the idea that the gang of mongrels are allowed to molest a mentally crippled young woman who had previously endured an awful rape, escaping from them through a window only to be impaled on a steel fence. What the maid suffers through is heinous, and to see Kersey's girl's fate is even more troubling.Jill Ireland, Bronson's real life wife, plays his girlfriend and Laurence Fishburne is one of the dirtbags who Kersey will eradicate like the cockroach he is. The plot essentially follows Kersey as he takes to the streets searching for those responsible for the deaths of his maid and daughter, a night predator seeking his prey. The streets are engulfed with low-lifes, gangs, drug dealers, prostitutes(and their pimps), and filth. It's like a wasteland where rats scurry about en masse, walls are decorated with graffiti, buildings of all have fallen to rot and ruin, and all sorts of cultures and creeds align the sidewalks and alley ways. And there is Kersey among them, out to annihilate the vermin which inflicted his life with further pain. Kersey is an LA architect who moved from New York due to the harassment of a cop who comes to the City of Angels hoping to catch the vigilante in the act so he can stop him.The motive of movies like DEATH WISH II is to present a gang so repugnant and revolting that they're deaths are applauded to the delight of the audience. The criminal element in LA according to Winner and company are only good for one thing and that's dying. Ireland's character is a journalist, Geri, a pacifist who believes the criminals should be rehabilitated, that the prison system doesn't stop crime, but perhaps contributes to it further.The ending tries to have it both ways. Kersey is punished for his willingness to strike back and loses Geri because of it, yet the whole movie affords him the opportunity to kill every last cretin. Is this movie supposed to question taking the law into your own hands when it seems the police are unable to deter crime? Or does it condone such vigilante actions? There's a for example scene where Kersey catches some of the gang attempting to rape the wife of a tourist, shooting them down before they were able to seal the deal. If he doesn't shoot it out with them, they will rape and possibly murder the woman, while her defenseless husband must listen from afar. When the police want his identification, the saved couple will not give it to them.Bottom line these dregs of society will continue to go about raping and pillaging, trading guns for cocaine, bullying citizens on buses, causing mischief and mayhem. Kersey is a symbol for what many of us fantasize about, but are seemingly too civilized to do.

As the film fades out, the camera zeroes-in on and freezes a tight shot of Mr. Kersey delightfully sighting his hand as a pistol delivering an imaginary & symbolic bullet to the unsuspecting and unaware street scum.SO WHAT is it about our town, Mr. Big Shot Hollywood Tycoon? Does it smell or something? After all, we were rightfully anticipating seeing what Mr. Kersey's Vigilante could do with our fair city; besides, the Union Stock Yards are long gone. THEN, you have this sudden and unexpected switch of venues to Los Angeles. We know that they could use Mr. Bronson's machismo and marksmanship in La-La Land too, but you promised! (There, Schultz and meself just had to get that off of our chests!) ONCE established in the West Coast Office of his Architectural Company, Mr. Kersey starts out to clean up the new town. He sets out as before with his concealed fire arm to seek out, hunt and destroy the enemy street thugs that haunt our streets; wherever we may live.BUT IN THIS second DEATH WISH outing, Kersey's role is modified from the former. In the original screen story, his modus operandi was one of a decoy. He would put himself in dangerous situations; so as to invite attackers to try to take him in robbery. Once the offender(s) were zeroing in for the kill, they were shot. Mr. Kersey then split the scene.THE NEW IMPROVED VIGILANTE of this sequel seems to be more in the tradition of the Super Hero. Much like Batman or Mighty Mouse, Kersey would come in to save the day in various assorted Robberies and Rapes in progress. His escapes from the scene seemed less convincing in Los Angeles' much more spread out cityscapes than in the Big Apple's densely packed asphalt & concrete jungles. Somehow eluding detection and capture are decidedly much more plausible in the act of ducking down into the subway than waiting for a public transit bus at a street bus stop.APPARENTLY following in the tradition of Lieutenant Gerard from THE FUGITIVE TV Series, the N.Y.P.D. Chief of Detectives Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) tracks Kersey all the way out there to the West Coast. Much like Gotham City's Chief O'Hara & Company; he's always arriving just a little too late.CARRY OVERS from the original were few. Other than Mr. Vincent Gardenia, we are only to find Director, Michael Winner; whose work here seems to have little resemblance to the dark, gritty and horrifying work on the real DEATH WISH. Joining Charles Bronson in this cast are Miss Jill Ireland (Mrs. Bronson in real life), J.D. Cannon, Anthony Franciosa, Robin Sherwood and even a very young Laurence Fishburne.ME AND ME BUDDY, SCHULTZ are still smiling about watching this on that winters night; a reaction, we assure you, that no one had any such feelings and emotions in seeing the original film.OUR VERDICT make like a hopscotch girl and skip it! NOTE * One could reason, of course, that to even to have been considered to have a sequel made would seem, in it self, to be highly flattering; for we noticed that there were never any RHINESTONE II, ISHTAR II or a DONDI Series. (Although there was an APPOLLO 13, which certainly must be a record for longevity!) NOTE ** Sharing the guilt and blame for this shallow follow-up were several production companies, being 1. Cannon Films, 2. City Films, 3. Golan-Globus Productions and 4. Landers-Roberts Productions; with the release & distribution being handled by Filmways (Domestic) and Columbia (non USA).POODLE SCHNITZ!!

Charles Bronson recreates the role of Paul Kersey, who we can remember lived in New York previously at the time of the first Death Wish film, now he lives in Los Angeles. Mr. Kersey has a very nice girlfriend in Miss Geri Nichols (Jill Ireland), and we also get to see Kersey's daughter Carol, who is still recovering from her traumatic run in with Jeff Goldblum and his two cronies years prior. What happens next is a more gruesome, equally as grisly rendition of what had transpired years prior to the ones Mr. Kersey loves/loved. Instead of going out to the streets and plugging away every mugger he can (like in the first film), Mr. Kersey wants to use his memory to locate the punks that did some not-so-nice things to his loved ones and even the score. Many critics shun this film for being too violent and really remorseless in its content, but I have a soft spot for Mr. Kersey and I felt this film really wasn't as bad as some say it is. Yes there is a rape scene in this movie, and trust me, I could've lived without watching that scene as much as the next person, but I understand how Michael Winner really wants the audience to be able to obtain some type of animosity towards the on-screen villains. The cold-calculated revenge Bronson exacts was well done, it's just straight up in your face violence, no B.S.. Vincent Gardenia reprises his role as Detective Frank Ochoa superbly, watch for Laurence Fishburne in the film as one of the thugs. Not the best Bronson film out there but by far not the worst either.

As the uncannily unlucky Paul Kersey, Bronson tries to get on with his life and carry on after the tragic murder of his wife from Part One. It isn't very long, naturally, before he unwillingly crosses paths with another gang of young cretins who rape his housekeeper and kidnap his catatonic daughter, who has already been undergoing years of therapy after the trauma she'd endured from the first movie. Before long, Kersey is pushed back to doing what he must to avenge his loved ones and clean up the neighborhood for the rest of us. Wearing a silly cap which makes him stand out like a criminal himself, he takes a cheap room in the heart of the city to make extermination easier. Vincent Gardenia returns as the policeman who follows Bronson's latest escapades, and Jill Ireland is another in the line of would-be Mrs. Kersey's whose patience is tested by her lover's leisure activities.Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page comes up with some razor-sharp and biting soundtrack noises to accommodate all of this, and while Part II is not a good film there's something I like about the sheer grittiness of it. It moves quickly, and Bronson gets his job done efficiently. He's not very much of an actor though, and sometimes his disinterested and laid back delivery of some of the dialogue is unintentionally humorous. The film as originally shot was much more graphic and had to be cut somewhat for release. **1/2 out of **** "}{"Title":"You believe in Jesus...

This time in sunny and smoggy L.A not cold and dark winter-time New York City. Paul Kersey, Charles Bronson, after a brief stay in Chicago has transfered his architecture firm to L.A and is planing to marry radio KABC personality and news writer Geri Nichols, Jill Ireland, and start a new life. After his old one was destroyed by a group of vicious muggers back in The Big Apple.Everything is going fine for Paul as not only that the police have stopped looking to arrested him, he was giving a free pass and ticket out of town courtesy of the the NYPD, his daughter Carol, Robin Sherwood, is recovering from the trauma of being raped and seeing her mother murdered back in NYC. One afternoon at a local amusement park a group of thugs pick-pocket Paul's wallet and with the information in it go to his home. In a home invasion the thugs brutally raped and murder Pauls live-in maid Rosaria,Silvana Gallardo. Later when Paul and Carol come home for dinner, that Roseria was to prepare for them, he's knocked out and Carol kidnapped and taken to an old deserted factory by those filthy lowlife swines who murdered Roseria. Sexually abused by the drug crazed cretins Carol makes a run for it as they try to gang-rape her and jumps out of a third floor window and falls to her death; you don't have to think real hard to guess as what's to happen next when Paul finds out what these mugger/murder/rapists scum did to Carol & Rosaria.Unlike the first Death Wish movie in this second installment Paul Kersey does track down and finish off the gang who did this dastardly act to him and those that he loved and cared for. With the body-count raising as Paul guns down the killers of his daughter and maid, Paul also puts away a number of other criminals as well, the LAPD gets in touch with NYPD Det. Frank Ochoa, Vicent Gradenia, who handled the the case of The New York Vigliante Killings some five years ago. At first trying to arrest Kersey, Ochoa knows that Kersey is the L.A Vigilante, he later saves his life by alerting Paul when he's about to be ambushed at a local park by the mugger gang, who were in the middle of doing a drug deal, at the coast of his own life.During the shoot-out with the muggers Paul puts away all of them except Charles Wilson, who shot and killed Let. Ochoa, who was arrested high on PCP's the next day.Paul impersonating a doctor goes to the prison hospital where Wilson is a prisoner/patient. Wilson isn't fooled by Pauls disguise and after a bloody and vicious slug-fest, where Wilson almost killed Paul, Pal cures his uncivilized behavior with a strong and friendly jolt of electricity. The L.A Police Department in the movie Death Wish II is as clumsy and ineffective as the NYPD was in Death Wish. Always the last ones on the scene of a crime and the first ones to try to stop decent and fed up citizens, like Paul Kersey, from trying to do the work that their not doing. Paul in this movie did get help from those you would not have expected him to get assistance from Det. Ochoa and Donald Kay, Charles Cyphers, an attendant at the prison/hospital. Kay let Paul escape after he did in his daughter's and Rosaria's rapist and murderer the violent and despicable and giggling Charles Wilson.

In short, this is an exploitation film, nothing special and nothing for the ages. Given the fact that I did not see the most revolting part of the film, maybe this will save the disinterested time and from having a bout of nausea.The plot is unoriginal being a rehash of the first, set in Los Angeles, where Architect Paul Kersey has moved to from Chicago (what, the place is crime-free?) after several years, to work on designing a new building for a radio station. The film's technical aspect is hardly the work of pros the camerawork and editing are not great - at times, the film looks like a grainy, slow-motion colour photostat, and the music score ranges from run-of-the mill suspense tune to headache-inducing heavy metal.Some action scenes are predictable, like Kersey's 'work' at a drug den. Others are amateurly staged, as a shootout complete with daft little dialogue - 'Don't hurt her!' Is said to the potential abductors as if they are suddenly going to think twice.  poor editing stands out in this scene; Kersey never seems to reload on-screen or on the soundtrack - he also seems to have enough bullets to kill, apart from when he misses a whole round.Yes, the violence is often repellant for those who faint at the sight or the thought of blood, beware! In one gunfight, several are turned to strawberry jam including a thug who is first shot, then practically impales himself on a switchblade (only to die after an unethical interrogation, shades of Dirty Harry).The film then turns plodding and dull Kersey is slashed in his first attempt to kill a thug (and later bleeds gorily on to the floor in front of his girlfriend Geri Nichols who remarkably doesn't seem to notice, given the conclusion) then is stabbed repeatedly with a scalpel that a thug concealed in his sneaker (and security was so poor as to allow Kersey to enter a locked ward in a mental hospital?) Anyways, I think you get the drift...and the original is a better bet.Watch at your own risk. 1.5 out of 5.

Then we get an unintentionally funny scene as Bronson (who looks uncomfortably constipated) turns out to be the only man in the world who could get mugged in a queue for ice cream! Whatever. Anything to get the squeaky wheels of the plot(!) in motion.Luckily, the scene where Rosaria gets repeatedly raped by the WARRIORS reject-looking youth gang was very heavily censored in the TV broadcast version I saw. Beats me who actually enjoys watching that kind of sick stuff anyway. At least the censor's scissors made sure we got to Bronson's revenge fest nice and quickly, and I really laughed at the ridiculously over-the-top scene in the drug den. Rats everywhere! Hardened thugs running a mile from a sixty year old man! The only semi-decent dialogue in the whole mess! (Do you believe in Jesus? You're gonna meet him. BAM!)There's another really funny scene where Larry Fishburne and a couple of his cohorts are doing a bad Village People dance number around a ghetto blaster. Who thought that one up?! And this is followed by one of the most lethargic 'action' sequences in film history, but at least we get to see Fishburne's head torn apart by a speeding bullet...lovely if you like that kind of thing! The final killing is another comic gem, as the Gilbert O'Sullivan lookalike hooligan meets his (literally) hair-raising doom. This film is BAD. Everything about it is truly rotten, yet I had a few half-decent laughs at the expense of the completely poverty-stricken nature of the production and the uniformly dismal acting. The fact that the film once contained a brutal, extended rape left a nasty taste in my mouth, and it says a lot for DEATH WISH II's grade-Z aspirations that it was included in the first place.What more can I say?

Eight years after Charles Bronson had first walked the mean streets of New York as the Sidewalk Vigilante in Death Wish (1974), director Michael Winner sends motion picture's toughest architect back on duty to cleanse the neighborhood of violent scum. The first Death Wish was a masterpiece that had been widely (and unfairly) bashed by critics for its violence and its alleged promotion of vigilantism. The main intention of this first sequel obviously was to exceed the violent stereotype of its successor - and it does so in a highly entertaining manner. While the original was not really glorifying self-administered justice as some critics claimed, the (incomparably more exploitative) sequel deliberately does exactly that. Director Winner doesn't even bother to throw in a long story before the action starts, and yet Death Wish II is all a Bronson fan could possibly desire.Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) has moved to LA with his daughter, who is still suffering from the traumatic events in the first film. After an attack in which his daughter and his Latina housekeeper are brutally raped and killed, it doesn't take Kersey long to return to his old ways - as the merciless avenger, who will clean the streets of scum vigilante style...Other than in the first part, in which Paul Kersey doesn't begin with his vigilante activities until the second half, the introduction is very brief in the sequel. The disturbing rape sequences are shown with exploitative stamina, but after that, Kersey doesn't take a long time to mourn his daughter, but goes directly to the vengeance part instead. The violence is way more excessive in the sequel than it is in the original (which had been bashed for its violent content eight years earlier), and it is quite obvious that director Michael Winner intended to cause some controversy. While Paul Kersey was more or less a kind everyday man who turned into a vigilante after his family had been victimized in the first part, he is now a dark avenger on a holy mission to cleanse the streets of 'scum'. This is far away from being the masterpiece the original was, but it is definitely a highly entertaining film to see. In case political correctness is an indispensable factor for you, you should avoid this like the black death. To my fellow Charles Bronson fans, however, this raw, brutal, and totally bad-ass revenge-fest is a must-see!

It seems like there's one in every scene, and in this one director Michael Winner seemed to enjoy filming the rape scene of the housekeeper. Paul's girlfriend was smart to give back his engagement ring at the end of this, to prevent her ultimate rape, and or murder. But seriously, I liked the way they continued the story here, although they really didn't explain very thoroughly why Paul moved from Chicago to Los Angeles, maybe he just moved there because there were more rapes per capita, but who knows? There was an interesting story line where the inspector from N.Y. was following Paul to catch him in the act, and possibly try to kill him? But for no apparent reason, he is exterminated in a gun fight helping Paul, and that storyline falls a bit flat.

One day on an outing, Paul is mugged by some punks and tries to fight back with little avail. For that they want revenge, and find out were he lives through his stolen wallet. They break in and brutally rape his maid. When he and his daughter arrive they knock him out and kidnap his daughter. It's not too long when Kersey hears from the police that they found his daughter dead. So now instead of leaving it to the police, he takes it upon himself to make sure these punks pay the ultimate price. Heck if the original offended you, don't touch this one&#133; even with a stick. Michael Winner's follow up to his cynically biting vigilante thriller Death Wish (1974), is one nasty piece of work that surpasses the predecessor in its harshly sordid and violently nihilistic exploitative nature. Winner's stringent direction doesn't hold back at all and the relentlessly jarring rape scene involving a maid is a true indicator of pushing the boundaries. It was eight years before Winner reunited with Charles Bronson to bring us the first trashy sequel (of the five piece franchise) looking to eventually pickpocket the success of the original and urban vigilante films (like The Exterminator (1980)) that were flooding the screens at the time. While the premise is a basic rehash of the first, there is a change of pace of sorts within the context. Instead here we get a b-grade, cold-blooded revenge tale that's only aimed at those responsible or somehow linked to the accused punks. Most of the picture involves Kersey face hunting and oddly enough, happening to come by those involved to simply waste them. The whole moral dilemma of killing (with the addiction-like qualities) for Kersey and that of a failing law and order system effectively worked in the original (even though it wasn't perfect). This was also broken up by nice dabs of black humour. On this occasion all of this its mostly swept aside for a straight-out and unsavoury thriller of the primitively depraved kind. Where the robot-like Kersey takes no time to get on with it with varying results and really stretches creditability. Losing out too it and what could have benefited the film was a wicked sense of humour. I thought there was too little of it here. The sequel also tries to tie back into the original's roots when Vincent Gardenia (the NY detective of the original) makes a return to help out the LAPD with their vigilante problem. Gardenia is superb again in a mild turn as his grizzled Det. Frank Ochoa character. Leading the show is a reliably lean and calculated Charles Bronson performance. He truly sticks it out with great vigour and can easily create empathy for his weathered soul. His not much for words, but the heartache tells just in his actions. Starring opposite of him is his wife Jill Ireland. She's modest as Kersey's girlfriend Geri, but the romance between the two became pretty much dead-weight. The punks of this story are extremely tacky. Thomas F. Duffy stood out as one wild and unstoppable nut. Look out in the gang for a young eccentric Laurence Fishburne wearing a rather flashy pair of pink sunnies. Economical direction, without being too flashy is Winner's strong point. He manages to display such a polish tinge to something that probably doesn't deserve to be and keeps it all pretty tight. What was the film's most successful aspect surely would have to be the forebodingly uncanny and wired rock score by Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page. He carried off one sickening killer instrumental tune after another to compliment the tenaciously wounding images and overall charged up feel in the air. The very notorious Death Wish II is full of bloodlust, indecent groping and plain unpleasantness. This would be the uncut version, though. A reasonable (although repellent) addition to the series.

This is not a debate about the wisdom of taking the law into your own hands to protect yourself. Michael Winner has chosen to dedicate his first Death Wish sequel purely to an audience hungry for exploitation and blood-letting. There seem to be an extraordinary number of people on the imdb who really like this film, but in truth it caters for a minority taste. People who get off on nasty, violent, trigger-happy movies will like this. Others will find their patience strained to the limit. Bronson returns as the vigilante Paul Kersey who had to leave New York in a hurry at the end of the previous film, having gone a little nuts after the murder of his wife and eradicating various muggers and scum-bags. Now he lives in L.A. His daughter lives with him, but has not recovered from her gang-rape in Part 1 (she is now little more than a traumatised vegetable). Some low-lifes rape his house-maid and kidnap his daughter; whilst trying to escape she falls and fatally impales herself. Bronson once again takes arms against the denominators of society in order to exact his revenge. A cop (Vincent Gardenia) from New York also turns up, investigating this new outbreak of vigilantism to see if it is connected with Bronson's previous revenge-fuelled killing spree. This sequel is a poor affair indeed, made purely for the box office returns. Part 1 was a massive hit, and this leaden follow-up merely wants to cash in on the success of its predecessor. The story has little credibility, since such horrendous experiences wouldn't happen to Bronson twice in two totally different cities in the space of a decade. The underlying moral debate that made Part 1 thought-provoking is gone, replaced by an unhealthy bloodlust. I know why a lot of admirers have written comments here on the imdb, but the reality of the matter is that Death Wish 2 is a horrible and unforgivable exploitation item which the majority of viewers will find repellent.

Everything is going fine until a group of thugs break into his home, kill his maid and take his still traumatized daughter hostage. After her death Kersey gears back up for some vigilante revenge.DEATH WISH was an extremely underrated movie that asked some serious political and social questions and it's easy to see why it was so controversial. The film was a very well-made picture and featured a terrific performance from Bronson. With the same director and star returning you'd think that some of that quality would transfer over but that's certainly not the case as DEATH WISH II is downright ugly in more ways than one. If you're looking for a film like the first one then you can forget that.What's going to follow is going to make it sound like I hate this picture but I really don't. DEATH WISH II, from a technical point of view, appears to be from a first time filmmaker because it's just downright sloppy. There's really not too much life in the picture and I'd argue that the editing, cinematography and the overall look of the film is quite poor. Many of the supporting performances are boring and director Michael Winner just doesn't add any visual style to the picture.Another major problem is the actual screenplay, which is pretty laughable if you really sit back and think about it. The odds of the same thing happening to the Kersey character is far-fetched but hey, it's a movie so suspension of disbelief is a good thing. Still, the screenplay's only purpose is to show Bronson seeking revenge. Whereas the first film asked political questions, this one here is just an exploitation movie that has the star going from one location to the next blasting people away If you're a fan of the series then these scenes are a lot of fun and one is extremely effective. The one where Bronson asks if a guy believes in Jesus is just priceless.DEATH WISH II is 100% exploitation and needs to be judged as such. The violence is pretty graphic at times as is the rape sequence, which certainly crosses the line. The film is available in a X- rated version as well as a cut R-rated version and I think a lot of people might prefer the shorter version because the rape scene really is that distasteful and vile. Still, if you're a fan of the series like I am, it's easy to overlook the faults of the picture and enjoy it for what it is.

Obviously Death Wish is his piece de resistance some would say (including me.) The ultimate revenge flick, dark, twisted, masterful, hard to watch...it is a classic exploitation flick. It is also the furthest thing from the type of flick that would normally be serialized it but they certainly did just that. It has been a long time since I made my way through the series so its time and so far I'm glad I did. The best compliment I can give Death Wish 2 is that it holds the same style, intrigue, violent gritty style and a story that is completely rehashed BUT never feels rehashed. It is the perfect epilogue and we actually want to know what happened to Paul Kersey and his vigilante crusade. As disturbing and violent as the first film was they manage to push the envelope with this one. The body count seems exponential and the battle is even harder for Kersey. These thugs actually fight back with guns and all. The film makers really make an effort to be shocking this time around with the gratuitous rape scene (much like the first film) and the bloody deaths but they don't do it in sacrifice of the story. The political aspect is there (in fact goes into even more depth this time around), you begin to understand and see Kersey's desire for vengeance but also how it has consumed it. An absolutely worthy action thriller that is realistically as good as the first.This role was just an absolutely perfect fit for legendary tough guy Charles Bronson. I constantly found myself amazed that he was in his sixties when he filmed this. Our ageing action stars get poked fun at now but he does not seem his age at all and is a realistic and perfectly acceptable action hero and holds his own against his attackers. Bronson is perfect as Kersey and no one else could have done it like he does. Jill Ireland is decent as Kersey's new love interest. She is pretty stiff and certainly isn't a stand out performance however she does seem comfortable and has good chemistry with Bronson so she fits the bill. One of the best things they could have done was bring back Vincent Gardenia as Frank Ochoa, the New York City Detective that pursued Kersey in the first film. I felt like their rivalry was left largely unexplored in the first film and they definitely brought it full circle in a truly perfect conclusion for the second film. The supporting cast are all good and fill their roles well including solid performances from JD Cannon, Ben Frank, Silvana Gallardo and Robin Sherwood.Director Michael Winner clearly had more story to tell and he did it well. Bringing in a new director would have been a completely different experience because Winner has a gritty, dark, exploitative style that he proved with Death Wish and other collaborations with Bronson. I can't imagine anyone coming out of Death Wish 2 not at least being pleased with the film. It is everything a sequel should be. They did everything right. They took everything that made Death Wish a stone cold vengeance classic and gave the fans everything they wanted and everything they needed in a sequel. It further the characters, develops the story further, gives us more of what we love from the first one. It is absolutely a worthy sequel that on its own merits is just okay but combined with the first is just as good. Bring on Death Wish 3!!! 8/10 "},{"Title":"What was the point of doing a sequel?

Paul Kersey is forced to be a one man wrecking crew once again when a group of thugs rape and kill his daughter, only this time in Los Angeles.Yes, i'm fully aware of the three sequels that commenced after this one. I never saw the logic in a sequel, let alone three more. The original Death Wish was cutting-edge for its time and it made a big statement. Money talks and BS walks, I guess. In all honesty, there are quite a few times where I was rather disinterested in this movie. It's essentially more of a sleazy version of the original, lacking the original's intensity. This is nothing more than vile exploitation, filled with chaotic violence. I wasn't offended by anything in this movie. (I'm a huge action and horror movie fan and I've seen plenty worse than this) There is a rape scene that is very explicit and quite uncomfortable to watch. I wasn't offended by them, but I can totally see why some would find it incorrigible. There are some questionable plot holes. Kersey's daughter being murdered could have totally been prevented. How did it not enter his mind that dealing with thugs again could lead to something disastrous? You'd have think he'd have been prepared, just in case. Charles Bronson can act macho with the best of them. He makes up for his average acting talent with presence and charisma. Jill Ireland is OK and thankfully tolerable. She has a tendency to play very unlikable people. Vincent Gardenia is wasted in his return. Robin Sherwood is terrible as the daughter. I get that she's supposed to be traumatized, but she can't act worth a lick. Watch her facial expressions when she is being raped. She appears to be enjoying it!

Paul now has a new woman in his life, KABC news reporter Geri Nichols. One day while he's out with Carol and Geri, Paul is mugged by some punks. Paul fights back, but they get away. The muggers want to get back at Paul for fighting back, so they go to his house. Paul is not there, but Carol is. So they rape and murder Paul's cook, and kidnap Carol and rape her -- the second time in her life that she's been raped, and she didn't even have a chance to recover from the first rape. After the muggers are done, Carol escapes and jumps from a window -- and she dies when she becomes impaled on the railings below. Paul is fed up with his family being attacked all the time, no matter where they live, so Paul rents a ratty hotel room, disguises himself, and sets out to find the muggers who killed Carol. When the LAPD deduces that that they have a vigilante on their hands, they decide to consult with the NYPD, who had their vigilante problem years ago.

That wouldn't be necessary a bad thing . Dirty Harry  had 4 more successful sequels that were worth watching ( The dead pool maybe is an exception). Why Bronson couldn't have the same thing ? They hired him and the director of original &#x96; Michael Winner , so you could expect at least some effort . You could expect they will try to continue the story of Kersey , try something new. Unfortunately , none of this happened . Instead they made a sequel which misses the point of the first movie and feels heavily like an uninspired remake.First movie had heart and substance. There was some violence , but it wasn't mindless. The hero was a true human being that could be hurt and killed . You cared about him and you could place yourself in his position. Death wish was both exciting and though-provoking.If you seen the original you shouldn't waste your precious time on this cynical sequel. The movies follows the formula so closely , that it feels like a rip-off . From what I've noticed even some dialogue comes straight from the first movie . The writer was so lazy he practically took every element from the first movie and changed only few details . There are some twists , but they are so pathetic , they aren't even worth a laugh .The problem is not only with the copy and paste  plot , but in the way this movie destroys what was achieved by the first one . The ending is disgustingly cool. Bronson in first DW was human who was hurting emotionally and could lose his life. Here his nothing more than a psycho who likes his job. There is very little of humanity in him , maybe in the first 30 minutes . The love story here feels completely fake and doesn't affect the main story or the hero in any way. Not to mention that he's practically invincible in this one . There is no tension , because there is no danger . I only feel some sympathy for hero thanks to the REALLY disturbing rape scenes . I 'm not gonna criticize the movie for trying to shock the audience , because that's how rape would look in real life . It was cheap , but still a necessary starting point for the movie to begin . Too bad that movie wasn't able to show anything more but violence for violence.I give it 3/10. Watch out for Laurence Fishburne (Matrix) in a small role of thug with cool 80's glasses . The music was composed by Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin and it's the best thing in the movie . It really sounds good and one could regret that such professional music appeared in such bad movie.

Death Wish II doesn't stray too far from the original in terms of plot, again two people close to Paul Kersey are raped & murdered so he turns vigilante to even the score & dish out some suitable punishment. While his wife died in the original it's his daughter this time around, the New York cop from the original Frank Ochoa returns after Los Angeles consults New York & he puts two & two together. The script which seems to take itself fairly seriously doesn't know the meaning of the word restrained & moves along like a rocket although it doesn't do subtle, within the first twenty minutes there's a mugging, a chase, two brutal rapes, a murder & an impaling on metal spikes although the rest of the film can't quite maintain the sleazy & frantic opening there's still shoot-outs, exploding cars, chases, attempted rapes, drug deals & a good look around some seedy parts of Los Angeles to keep one entertained for it's 90 odd minute duration. The character's are quite thin, Kersey is shallow, his girlfriend Geri seems almost irrelevant, the cops are idiots & the gang members & various thugs are shown as total scum without any redeeming features. While fairly predictable & nothing deep I did like Death Wish II as pure exploitation filth, hey, I'm easily pleased I guessed.I am happy to report the sleaze levels are pleasingly high, available in a cut & uncut version the later is the way to go as the housekeeper is gang raped for about five minutes in a sequence that becomes unpleasant to watch & maybe does go a little too far. There's also the usual shoot-outs, stabbings, nudity & very 80's gangs who wear some very silly looking clothes. The script throw's in a few ideas about the rights & wrongs of punishment & the criminal system but they seem like afterthoughts (for instance, the hospital programme to reform criminals is mentioned but then ignored as it just becomes a location for another set-piece killing) but at least they tried, at least under the nudity, violence & rape the makers tried to get across a deep moral & social message (!).With a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 this was filmed in Los Angeles this has decent production values although does look a little static at times. Death Wish II was actually Charles Bronson's first ever sequel & he was sixty one when he shot it along with his then wife Jill Ireland. Led Zepplin guitarist Jimmy Page composed the music after the producer's originally wanted to hire Isaac Hayes.Death Wish II is about as unsubtle as they come, it entertains in a violent cartoonish sort of way that I liked. Don't expect any depth or sensitivity as there isn't any but as a sleazy 80's exploitation flick there aren't many better.

Charlie Bronson's DA MAN!","Date":"5 January 2008","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" With Death Wish 2, the unscrupulous and unequaled trash-director Michael Winner perfectly epitomizes what a textbook sequel is all about! The original 1974 film was a modest masterpiece that gave a whole new meaning to the term ambivalence, whereas the sequel strictly wants to still the fans' increasing hunger for the depiction of graphic rapes and excessively violent retribution. During the first film, you were continuously tempted to think Paul Kersey's merciless vigilante crusade was somewhat justified, because the murder of his wife and rape of his daughter obviously tore him up inside and because he aimed his 'cleansing' actions at New York criminals in general. The intent of Death Wish II was considerably different. This time set in L.A, Paul Kersey's slowly revalidating daughter (as well as his Latino housemaid) once again falls victim to a group of vicious rapists and muggers, only now she doesn't survive the assaults. The poor girl jumps out of a window in an attempt to escape and becomes impaled on a fence. That was a pretty shocking & repugnant sequence, by the way, and definitely not advisable for squeamish people to see. Anyway, reason enough for Paul Kersey to prowl the crime-infested LA streets at night, dressed like a burglar himself, and form a one man vigilante army. Especially in comparison with the original, this sequel represents pure & genuine exploitation! The deaths of Kersey's daughter and housemaid are totally irrelevant and neither of them is mentioned a single time again after the horrible events. Paul Kersey isn't nearly as heartbroken now as he was in the first film. Quite the contrary, he almost seems happy because his daughter's death gives him a cheap excuse to pick up the guns again. Kersey's vengeance spree is also extremely targeted now, as he deliberately doesn't cooperate with the police's investigation and exclusively goes after the thugs that invaded his home whilst all the rest can rape and kill all they want. And last but certainly not least, he's a legitimate executioner now who takes out his targets with clean shots between the eyes and whilst saying a somewhat cool one-liner during the process. Now, does all this necessarily have to be negative criticism? Heck no, because Winner and Bronson basically just deliver what the audiences want and it works. And why shouldn't they? The original handled about a lot more about drama and morals, but the critics hated it anyway. Death Wish 2 is a very adrenalin-rushing thriller and this time it obviously takes pride in its outrageous and immoral depiction of pure violence. The film completely lacks style and narrative elegance, but at least everyone involved in the production is aware of it. I like to think Michael Winner deliberately intended to punch the critics in the face with this film. In conclusion, I just have to point out a couple of terrific details of ineptitude and clichéd storytelling featuring in Death Wish 2 1) If your name is Charles Bronson, you're allowed to park your car in the handicapped places. 2) Apparently, a radio doesn't provide safe facial cover when you're being shot at. 3) Vincent Gardenia also returns as the elderly cop Frank Ochoa, but he makes a dreadful rookie-mistake. One of the first things he says here is that he's retiring at the end of the year. Oh boy, all fans of clichéd action movies just know that's like signing your own death certificate.

The first film was so stark staring mad it was like watching a movie from another dimension but in retrospect at least it had SOMETHING to say. The sequel easily tops the original in the bad taste stakes and has not one satirical, rabble-rousing or thought-provoking idea to justify its distasteful set-up. It's just foul.In the first movie architect Paul Kersey, played by Charles Bronson, became a gun-toting vigilante when his wife was murdered and his daughter was raped. Presumably following the rule that sequels must be bigger and better, this instalment's plot sees his maid raped and beaten to death, while his daughter, now mute and in a care home, is kidnapped, raped again, and then jumps through a window and is impaled on railings below, blood pouring from her mouth. Did no one involved with this ghastly spew have the sensitivity to rein all this in? Is it really necessary? Did no one think it was excessive and cruel? Michael Winner seemed like a likable enough buffoon, so why did he make such grotty, hateful films? Once the scene is set and my stomach had been duly churned, Kersey wrestles with his conscience for the requisite zero seconds before he pulls on his woolly hat and goes after the scumbags. Now, it's not as though they don't deserve what's coming to them, but if for no other reason than to provide engaging drama, shouldn't we get some sense of what's going on in Kersey's mind? Does he agonise over his actions? Who knows? He isn't even empty and remorseless in a sad, broken way, like The Punisher. The film-makers aren't interested in examining him, and neither is Bronson if his lifeless performance is anything to go by.The film's approach is wrong, wrong, wrong. If we're supposed to side with Kersey (and we are), cast an actor capable of delivering a performance with depth. If we're supposed to be outraged by the crimes that set him off, make us horrified at the events rather than the leering way in which they're presented. If we're supposed to have a cathartic reaction when the villains are killed, make them something other than cackling cannon fodder. This is all assuming that the film is supposed to have any effect on you besides sadistic glee, and I'm not sure it is. On a moral level, then, the film is a wasteland. On a technical level, it's inept to a breathtaking degree. Winner edits about as well as he directs and displays no awareness of how to pace a film, no sense that scenes can be anything other than shapeless and jerkily hacked together; the dubbing is poor and papered over sloppy cuts, while the droning score irritates. The script flatly offers such bon mots as 'Goodbye' before Kersey despatches his latest victim, and the rest of the dialogue is just wind. Bronson is joined this time around by his real-life wife Jill Ireland, and congratulations to her for playing a female character who gets from one end of the film to the other without getting beaten, raped, murdered, or all three. Vincent Gardenia's cop from the original film, continuing his character arc of having a cold, isn't so lucky he dies during a shootout between Kersey and his prey, choosing as his last words 'Get the f***ers for me' rather than 'It's your fault I'm dead', which seems like an odd choice under the circumstances.This cheapjack garbage might have been in some way watchable had it been made with a trace of dignity, or satire, or taste, or talent, or integrity. But no. It pretends to be gritty while using explicit rape scenes as an excuse for a thin plot and exploiting weak characters in reprehensible ways. It's a horrible, horrible film.

It wasn't just an action movie, with as much blood and violence in it as possible. It was actually a movie with a deep story, that made you feel for the main character and didn't tried to glorify anything. It was a simple movie but yet it also was so much more than just a revenge flick. It was movie that actually made you think.This rather late sequel to the 1974 classic is basically the opposite of its predecessor. It's very little involving and basically the movie is purely about getting revenge, after Bronson his character's daughter and housekeeper get killed by a couple of punks.Despite these horrible events, the movie remains shockingly distant and empty with its emotions. The character of Bronson seems to be very little effective by the death of his traumatized young sweet daughter. He just keeps joking and fooling around with his girlfriend, which all makes the revenge plot very hard to get involved with really.It all makes Death Wish II a very little interesting and also little original action movie from the early '80's. Charles Bronson still gives the movie some certain flair and a little bit of extra but it still remains a far from perfect sequel. Perhaps its best to stick to the original and forget about all of these sequels that got made (four in total).The movie still manages to create a good atmosphere, though Los Angeles certainly ain't no New York City. Still the movie has a bit of an '70's atmosphere over it, which is a good thing. It certainly ain't as generic looking as other '80's action-flicks do.Nevertheless I would far from recommend Death Wish II. It basically lacks about everything that made the first movie still such a great and original one to watch. 4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Better than Death Wish 1, but not as better as Death Wish 3","Date":"23 December 2006","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Well, this flick is better than the first Death Wish movie. It tells what happens when an innocent family is ruined by rape and murder, with the police doing virtually nothing. That is, nothing---until Paul Kersey (played by Charles Bronson) comes in and metes out his famous vigilante justice in a way Paxton Quigley had wanted--with a firearm.Only Sudden Impact, where Sondra Locke plays an already-raped woman who metes out justice against the rapists by deadly force--has some relation to Death Wish II.Jill Ireland (who plays Geri Nichols) is still my third favorite innocent-looking movie actress in my lifetime. Only Karen Lynn Gorney in Fever is my first favorite.In the famous arrest scene involving character Charles Wilson, it seems like he is some type of criminal superman, impervious to police taser darts and officers trying to arrest him for 25 seconds---until he is finally gang-tackled by police to the ground.Yes, Lawrence Fishburne is in the flick as one of the muggers...much different than that of him being in The Tuskegee Airmen.It was lucky that this movie, filled with the usual gun-wielding violence by character Paul Kersey, also has twinges of any James Bond movie---there is the love interest mechanism when Geri Nichols, who works at a broadcast radio station, realizes that Paul is more than just a vigilante in an incognito way. He was also a very handsome person on the outside.Wedding bells between Geri and Kersey were in the air as they conversed outside a cafe while Charles Wilson was confined to a state hospital. He kept secret from her his own plan to eliminate Charles Wilson, who killed character Frank Ochoa (a New York police officer who was planning to put an end to Kersey's vigilante violence). He did keep that thing classified but the big mistake was that he left a photocopy of the State Hospital ID in his living room--he should have ripped it and threw it out.And so hurtful that the marriage that was going to be was not to be when Geri found evidence (that mentioned photocopy) that Kersey disguised himself as a McClaren State Hospital psychologist and electrocuted Charles Wilson in the hospital's electroshock room with, I guess, 20,000 to 30,000 volts of current, in the final fight of the flick. Geri took off the engagement ring, got out of Kersey's house, went to her car and sped off without saying a word to Kersey. And you probably cried for Kersey---because when Kersey finished off Charles Wilson, you think the movie would end happily. But it didn't end happily.

There's a huge number of middle-class educated people who live close to some of the most wonderful cities in America, who never go in there because they are afraid.

Indeed, as Margaret Hinxman wrote in the Daily Mail, Death Wish 2 is The sort of sequel that makes you realise that the original wasn't half so bad as you thought.In this one the plot is identical, the twist is that it's set in a different city. A bunch of crooks attack his family again. The difference is that whereas in the original the rape scene was a not too graphic short sharp shock, in this film it is leeringly drawn out. Is this to show how vile crime and criminals are? Perhaps. Does it feel shoehorned in for pervs? Certainly.After this Kersey goes on the rampage again, and this is where the film gets really silly. Part of the strength of the original Death Wish film is that Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) never actually tracks down the crooks who attack his family. Whilst condoning vigilantism, it still feels a little hollow that those guys got away.Here, Kersey is trawling Los Angeles looking for targets. Now I haven't been to L.A., but I imagine it's pretty big. You know, you're not too likely to keep bumping into the same people at random. Well, you're not Charles Bronson. While out one night, Kersey stumbles across the same hoodlums who attacked him earlier in the film! Fancy that. As if this stroke of luck was not enough, later on he's strolling around when he hears a scream. He goes to investigate and, in the peculiar haze of sexual violence in which this film operates (there is one gang rape, one rape and another attempted rape), he comes across a rape. But, get this, the rapists are some of the gang who attacked him earlier! Now how's that for luck! It gets one mark for two reasons.

One day some muggers break into his house, rape and kill his maid, then attack him on entering, and kidnap Carol.

The police know that there is a vigilante on the loose, and they find Detective Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) who dealt with and found Paul before. Near the end, Paul manages to kill all the muggers that got his daughter, and unfortunately they manage to kill Ochoa trying to help him, and when is left alive, Paul manages to use false identity to finish the job.
