[{"Title":"Accurate and smart; great performance by Sandra Bullock. *** out of ****.","Date":"4 May 2000","Score":"40 out of 50 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  28 DAYS / (2000) ***	28 Days is one of the most accurate movies about alcoholism and drug addiction I can remember. The film does not glamorize or poke fun at its thematic content, but instead shimmers in truth depicting the problems in which a nowhere life can lead. Why would anyone want to see a movie about someone spending time in rehab, regardless of how well crafted it is? Because 28 Days is an interesting, sometimes funny, and involving tale with empathetic, down to earth characters. Do not let this production pass by you without a watch. 	The film's main character is named Gwen Cummings and is played by the talented Sandra Bullock. She lives a wild, crazy life with her boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West). Gwen is an alcoholic and a drug addict, and does not get much support from her similar love interest. As the movie opens, the two get drunk at a club, come home, have sex, and put out a fire with wine. The next day, Gwen arrives late to her sister's wedding, only to destroy an expensive dessert and crash a limousine into a house. 	The Gwen Cummings character is developed clearly and effectively. We learn about her lifestyle, recognize faults, and are shown a dark history through painfully real flashbacks. This is one of the things that make 28 Days so involving. We discover elements about the character and notice inner changes as she learns of them herself. I really cared about this character.	Gwen is given a choice, she can serve jail time for her wrongdoing or can waive that and spend 28 days in a rehab clinic. She chooses rehab. The head counselor is Cornell (Steve Buscemi), who shows empathy but also coyness. Also present at his heath clinic is an assortment of characters who sing sappy melodies and share group love, including Daniel (Reni Santoni), with thick glasses and medical capabilities, Andrea (Azura Skye), Gwen's young roommate, and Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen), a famous baseball pitcher with a drinking problem. Gwen's experiences in rehab seem truthful and accurate. Her withdrawals and agonies are realistic and knowledgeable. It is obvious the filmmakers and Sandra Bullock thoroughly researched the stresses and details of rehab.	Sandra Bullock performs with the right amount of immaturity and charisma. This wonderful actress is set free in this kind of heart filled role; she is best when the main character. Here, Gwen is free to tread the surface of the movie and still allows other characters to contribute to her defining.	About half way through, the movie losses its much needed focus on Gwen and drifts into detailing relationships, friendships, and other characters. While most of the events that take place surround Gwen, the movie was on the right track with its first half. 28 Days is smart enough to recognize its blunder, however, and by the final scenes it regains the emotionally correct material and concludes with high standards.The filmmakers are advertising it as a comedy, but only an isolation of sequences offer hilarity or slapstick. This movie teaches us lessons through its characters. And the lessons are well taught.

Don't be fooled by the advertisers and trailers, this movie is a drama. There is a little comedy thrown in the mix to keep things light at times (after all, rehab is a depressing subject), but the balance is about 80/20% in favor of drama.Sandra really shines. This movie is all hers and she proves that while bubbly and energetic may be her niche, she can also be gritty and subtle to great effect. She's always been a very solid and dependable actress, but she gets to dig deeper here. She could have played this role in so many ways that would have been easy and predictable, but luckily she gave just the right amount of weight to her character. It's certainly her best acting performance.Betty Thomas also delivers another strong effort. The pacing and amount of scene time seem just right. There is very interesting camera work and flashback scenes that work very well. I guess the best thing to say is that she made a formula movie (girl bottoms out, girl resists rehab, girl comes to terms and embraces recovery) without boring us with the formula.In short, the best thing about the movie is what it wasn't. It could have been so cliched (although there were a couple of unavoidable ones) and paint-by-numbers. Instead, it was more subtle rather than over the top.There are good performances by all, especially Steven Buscemi who plays his small role straight and somber. This film has higher artistic/merit value than it does entertainment value (afterall, how entertaining can a movie about rehab be?). It's a solid 7.

She is not gung ho for a treatment center, but her other option is jail. Actually, I was not sure how she avoided jail at all, and 28 days seemed too short a time for all the hilarity, action and breakthroughs in this film, but other than these things, I was really impressed with Bullock and the ensemble acting - the balance of comedy and drama. The one actor I thought over-acted was in the character of Gwen's boyfriend. He was too much, and it was a relief to see him off the screen. Viggo Mortensen is endearing as the other guy for Gwen. I would like to have seen more of them together. I think people will love the soap opera gags and the send-up of drug/alcohol treatment centers, but will also get the serious nature of the interactions in the chemistry among all the characters in treatment in the film.

The problem the film itself tipsily overindulges its themes by balancing good drama with over-acting and imbalanced doses of comedy. In a sense, the film knew it was dealing with touchy subject matter when it highlighted the realities of rehab in NY, but why did it need to purposefully throw in the stereotypical comedic archetypes - the viking accented Alan Tursdysk, or O'Malley's strapdown one liners, or for that matter, the debonair English accented intelligent metro lover in Dom West? Perhaps it was in 2000, and you needed to sell films that way to appeal to their target audience of teenagers who did weed and drank too much, but the fact is, when you have Steve Buscemi, Sandra Bullock and Viggo Mortensen in a film you can afford to push the drama-reality envelope and go in that direction. In fact, the film's best moments are when Thomas does this- in a series of flashbacks to let the audience get in sync and depth with Bullock's character. And, there are scenes where the comedy can be done appropriately and in concordance with the film's thematic content- such as the skit at the end for Azura Skye's character. Sadly, these good moves are coupled with some really tipsy flaws, including the ending where Mortensen's character meets the soap star. Bullock's character also undergoes way too quick a character change (for 28 days) if one was to really nitpick.However, the themes in this film make this a film i would still recommend to youth and young people. Azura Skye's character's loneliness, depression and suicide are genuinely depicted, and the fragile and important message of hope and redemption amid the perfunctory nature of life in the rehab centre that are celebrated in the plot really help this film regain its footing. When Bullock's character realises that this (the pills and drugs) was not a way to live, and Mortensen addresses her insecurities of not being able to do a single thing right, the film touches significant depths and strikes the chords of viewers. My personal favourite was the scene were Lizzy Perkins' character acknowledges the flaws of hers and her sister's lives and establishes love and hope in reconciliation. You see, it is the film's ability to reach such levels that I know this film suffered from tipsily overindulging its themes-trying to tie in too much to everyone- from being a comedy to a drama.

(Dir Betty Thomas)Addiction is not funny nor is the suffering it inflicts upon the addict and their friends and family but then again all `taboo' subjects have been scrutinized in these politically correct times we live in and here Sandra Bullock, The Girl Next Door that her adoring public has embraced as America's Sweetheart, wades in hip deep into a difficult balancing act as alcoholic/drug abuser Gwen Cummings, in this comedy-drama with more hits than misses - the working title could have been `Party Girl, Interrupted.'Gwen is a free-spirited New York City based writer who enjoys living it up with her equally party hearty beau Jasper (West) by drinking and binging into the wee hours even if it means nearly missing her older sister Lily's (Perkins) wedding the next day as they stumble to the proceedings nursing a severe hangover quickly remedied by more imbibing at the reception resulting in Gwen losing her balance on the dance floor upsetting the many tiered wedding cake.  Undeterred by her scene-causing out-of-control ramifications, Gwen staggers to the newlyweds' limo and careens along a suburban area looking for a `cake shop' to replace the damaged goods only to have her smash the car into a nearby house.Flash forward to her being sentenced to Serenity Glen, a rehabilitation clinic, the type that offers New Age-y touchie-feely bonding and chanting (`Together! Together! NOOOO Drugs!') and a no-nonsense counselor named Cornell (Buscemi in a nicely handled understated turn) who sees right through Gwen's anger and stubbornness as she attempts to disassociate herself from her chores, group therapy and sneaking pills in via Jasper.  After a mishap involving Gwen falling from her window (after a weak attempt to rid herself from the pills), she limpingly begs Cornell for a chance to redeem herself.  Her sarcasm slowly drifts away as she comes to grips with her co-dependency on booze and pharmaceuticals thanks largely to her depressed teenage roomie Andrea (Skye) and new patient, Eddie Boone (Mortensen), a baseball pitcher overcoming many addictions including casual sex.The film works solely on the fresh-scrubbed sexy appeal of Bullock in her range from comic drunkeness (a la `Arthur') to her scary withdrawl and gumption to change her life for the better.  The humor comes thankfully to her fellow in-house patients including a gay German dancer (Tudyk who comes across as Andy Dick in `Sprockets') and the parody of a soap opera (`Santa Cruz') that the entire group becomes.well addicted to.   It's hard to believe that the subject of a chemically dependent person could be funny, but that isn't the point.  The point is that it doesn't make light of the situation at all (including the all-too-forseeable overdose of one of the characters to underscore just how serious it is), but it succeeds on the `patients-running-the-asylum' scenario - sort of a cross-blend of `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest',  `Clean and Sober' and `M*A*S*H' with its hysterically, deadpanned homage of loudspeaker announcements.Director Betty Thomas (`The Brady Bunch Movie', `Private Parts') serves her story by Susannah Grant (`Erin Brockovich') as best she can with interesting camera angles to distort the hyperreality of someone under the influence and able support including stand-up comic O'Malley (late of his short-lived eponymous sitcom) who harbors a not-so-secret crush on Bullock. Bullock does herself a service by starring in a tricky scenario by utilizing her natural acting style and stretching her chops both dramatically and comically.

This is a drama which has many fine comedic moments. Sandra Bullock plays the main character whose life is filled with booze and pills, and whose sister says at the wedding, You make it impossible for anyone to love you. Drunk, and driving the limo to get a cake to replace the one she and her boyfriend wrecked, she wrecks into a house.  The judge sentenced her to 28 days in jail, or 28 days in rehab. Rehab is difficult, because of the sobriety. Steve Buscemi plays a straight role as her therapist. The strange agglomeration of characters in her therapy group are reminiscent of One Flew Over. Viggo Mortensen is a major league pitcher who can't remember what he did last night.  Any last night.This is a good, tender film that addresses a big problem for many people - relying on booze and/or drugs and still believing they can live a normal life.  It is by no means a perfect film, nor will it stand the test of time, but I found it very entertaining and meaningful, and rate it a solid 7 of 10.The DVD picture and sound are fine, but in no way outstanding.  The extras are primarily a making of HBO special, plus the actual soap opera Santa Cruz which was made especially for this film, and has a recurring presence in it.

I watched it in the morning while finishing last night's left-over gin that was diluted with water from melted ice from the previous night. I saw myself. The reason I dislike rehabilitation movies is that I feel like I'm watching someone else's problems, and I don't like entertainment based on someone else's pain. For those who like this type of entertainment, it is excellent. For those who need a life-changing event, it may serve that purpose too.

And strangely enough, many of these actors and actresses choose the same exact route to accomplish this feat &#150; that of portraying a person heavily addicted to drugs and/or alcohol.  This was the case with, for instance, Meg Ryan in `When a Man Loves a Woman' and Michael J. Fox in `Bright Lights, Big City' to name just a few.  Now we have Sandra Bullock attempting to stretch her thespian muscles by portraying an alcoholic in `28 Days,' the tale of a young woman's experiences in a detox center located in a bucolic suburb of New York City.One of the initial problems with such films is that casting such well-known faces in these parts automatically ends up conferring a bit too much glamour on the situation.  And `28 Days' is no exception.  It's hard to accept Bullock as a particularly credible person in this role.  Still, the movie is generally watchable because it manages to make the people and the rituals at the center seem both utterly addled and emotionally endearing all at the same time.  When Bullock &#150; feisty, close-minded, smug in her sense of superiority - first arrives after being ordered to the center as a part of her probation, we are as appalled as she is by the touch-feely nature of what is going on there.  If anything could keep one from becoming an addict, the threat of being sent to a place like this would just about do it.  But then, as the various characters begin to open up and reveal themselves as true hurting individuals, we, like the Bullock character, begin to be won over.  But even these people aren't given enough screen time to really grow into fully-rounded, complex characters in their own right.The film never entirely breaks out of its TV-movie formula.  We are treated to all the standard plot devices common to the genre  the inevitable overdose by one of the patients, romantic interludes with a professional baseball player, the clashes between the latter and Bullock's troublemaking boyfriend.  One of the problems with glossy studies of addiction such as this one is that, more often than not, we are led to believe that the `cure' is a permanent one &#150; not necessarily because the film shows us that (in fact, it makes a few nods in the direction of showing that it ISN'T always permanent) but because the two-hour time frame and the audience demand for a hopeful, upbeat ending inadvertently leave us with that impression.  To be fair to the film, it doesn't tie up all the loose ends into a nice pretty package.  We are given cause for hope, but the open-ended nature of the final scenes suggests properly that the struggle will go on.`28 Days' is a film with its heart in the right place.  In fact our own hearts go out to it, to Ms. Bullock, to all those involved in its making.  We realize that it is difficult to make a film that, on the one hand, yearns to be an uncompromising study of a subject as gritty as this one, yet, on the other, feels the need to appeal to as wide a mass audience as possible.  The result, unfortunately, is a film that is too lightweight to be taken seriously, too `entertaining' to be real. "},{"Title":"I liked this movie - but it isn't very good","Date":"20 July 2001","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!!!OK, I admit that I liked this movie - like I confess that occasionally I listen to Anne Murray records (I can say that because I'm secure in my masculinity). Well, actually I liked Sandra. I know, she's not on par with Audrey Hepburn, Merrill Streep, Jodie Foster, or Helen Hunt but, there is a certain charming, disarming aura about her that says to me, this movie is not great cinema, but love me despite my weaknesses.  She's cute, funny (sometimes) and doesn't have to take her clothes off to be sexy.Enough of my confessions, on to the movie. 28 Days was not the moving analysis of an alcoholic drug abusing life forced into rehab movie that I thought it would be (though I didn't have really high expectations to begin with). There were very few profound moments that brought insight into the devastation of alcoholism and drug abuse. In fact, it actually made addiction and rehab look fun (except for the puking your guts out while Sandra's character dried out). This movie wouldn't be much help to detour viewers from addiction. That's where I have the biggest problem.There are two reasons why this movie failed to be impactful FIRST - the cast and dialog were flat, mediocre, and non-provocative. The actors weren't convincing, they didn't stand out and make their characters memorable. They were very plain-vanilla two-dimensional entities. Even Sandra's character, as much as she charms me, was flat and shallow (again, not that I expected Oscar caliber work from her). I really wanted to bond with these people, to get a sense of what they were going through. It didn't happen. The dialogue was weak as well, which pushed this film further into mediocrity (and clearly didn't give the cast much to work with). There were no truly memorable quotes from any of the characters. There were few emotional scenes, and again, they came off rather flat and mundane. SECOND - the treatment of the subject was shallow and glossy. Addiction and abuse of controlled substances is a much more dangerous and destructive life style than depicted.  We only see one mild-to-moderate situation with relatively minor consequences. For example Sandra's character and boyfriend are late for her sister's wedding, having been drinking all night. They show up drunk and continue to drink until her character looses balance and destroys the wedding cake. She then proceeds to steals a limo and crashes it into someone's front porch (killing a ceramic lawn jockey in the process). Her only injuries are embarrassment and a bloody but not serous bonk on the head. This leads to court, which leads to the rehab assignment and the rest of the movie.There were two pseudo-emotional scenes that carried the impact of a NERF baseball bat. Sandra's character is required to have a family member come to a counseling session to confront her about her past behavior and, her roommate (very young heroin addict) kills herself with an overdose the morning she is to be discharged.  I didn't have a `relationship' with these characters enough to be moved by these events, and the dialogue was so uninteresting that it brought these potentially moving scenes down further. Sure, death of a young addict is tragic but in this film it came across as merely unfortunate. I know, I said I liked this film. Mostly for Sandra's charm, yet there were some small insightful anomalies scattered here and there. For example, some fellow rehabbers were not convinced they had problems. They were uncooperative and didn't take the program seriously. We also get a mini insight (though in a down-played non-event sort of way) into the true recovery rate of these programs. We see one character return after his release, having gone back to his addiction.I liked the pitching lesson and how Sandra's character was instructed to throw with her eyes closed. The moral implied is that you only have control of the pitch until the ball leaves your hand. Do what you can while you are in control - after that there is no sense in worrying about what you can't control (the serenity prayer condensed).  While this was a deep thought, its delivery and source were awkward (it came from an alcoholic pro baseball player in rehab. If he is so enlightened why is there in the first place?).Another scene I liked was during the `confrontation'. I have to give credit to the writers, director and editors, for what seems to be a well-planed and executed surprise.  Sandra's character is hearing her sister rip on her about destroying the wedding. She seems to be unaffected until her sister brings up an embarrassing and offensive drunken toast.  She is enraged that her sister would make up such a story but quickly realizes that it really happened, she just doesn't remember it. The impact of this scene is enhanced because we think we have seen all the relevant scenes of the wedding then this comes out of nowhere.  For a brief instant we make contact with the main character. We feel as stunned and confused as she does. Very good execution of a stunning and effective device that wasn't destroyed by the film's other weaknesses.In a nutshell, 28 Days is mildly entertaining for Sandra Bullock fans. It isn't profound or particularly moving, and gives the Hollywood gloss-over to addiction and rehab. There are some redeeming qualities but overall the character development and dialogue are flat, not engaging the viewer. I generously give it a 6/10.

The potentially powerful storyline just lacked scenes or dialogue that carried any gravity. It seemed as though the beginning of the movie where Sandra's Gwen was a thoughtless, disgusting alcoholic with no consideration for others was supposed to be some kind of slapstick humor. Oh look, what a goofball! She stole a car, drove drunk, and crashed into a house. Whoopsie! Rehab was a mish mash of clichéd characters and stereotypical behavior. A couple of things I did appreciate during the rehab scenes were (1) Sandra's performance regarding the physical withdrawal from substances, (2) the scenes when Sandra flashes back to her childhood and her mother's alcoholism, and (3) the touching, well acted scene between Gwen and her sister Lily at rehab. Other than that, the other patients at rehab were caricatures of typical addicts and were so silly it was offensive at times. Sandra gives a nice performance. Steve Buscemi is always great and he gives some gravity to his brief role. Other than that, it's not that good and I can't recommend it.

True detox will have you on the toilet, getting sick from both ends, for days and days, no letting up. Some rehabs will medicate you to ease some of the symptoms, but you still go through it.

The one thing that shatters Gwen is Andrea's suicide attempt. In the end Gwen is able to leave the facility with a somewhat new attitude toward life in general. She also finds out Jasper is not exactly the man she needs.28 Days is a comedy that was tailor made for its star. Directed by Betty Thomas, an actress herself, is not an unpleasant movie to sit through. We saw it when it first came out, but didn't comment on it then. On second viewing, it's not as terrible as we once thought. The screenplay is by Susannah Grant, who wrote Erin Brockovich, and the much better In Her Shoes. This film follows in many ways the formula of much of Hollywood pictures and although it begins with a bang, it soon fizzles after Gwen's settles into the clinic's routine.Sandra Bullock is a good actress who deserves better material. Even though she usually does a lot of comedy, we think she is ripe to do more dramatic roles that will suit her better at this stage of her career. That said, she does well under Ms. Thomas' direction. She is a riot during the first part of the movie. Viggo Mortensen is totally wasted as the baseball player with a drug problem. He is just not believable in this role. Dominic West, an actor that is always good, fares better. Azura Skye has some excellent moments in the film, as does Steve Buscemi, in a straight forward role, different from what he usually plays. Diane Ladd, Reni Santoni, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste do a fine supporting job. Unfortunately Alan Tudyk's neurotic Gerhardt is false from the start.

The film opens with a grainy and quick exposition of Gwen (Sandra Bullock) partying up with her friends, drinking and drugging to excesses.  In a matter of a minute or two, you get a rough idea of this party girl's lifestyle with her boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West).  When she awakens in a drunked stupor and realizes she is late for her sister's wedding, she grabs Jasper and a beer and heads off.  At the wedding reception, her sister (Elizabeth Perkins) is very embarrassed at Gwen's galavanting which ends in a drunk driving scene that literally shrunk my nuts back into my abdomen. All this, mind you, takes place in a matter of 5 minutes screen time.  The movie then moves to a Girl, Interrupted-like rehab center where Gwen must learn to cope with all the other patients and an odd assortment of staff led by an addict-turned-counselor (Steve Buscemi in a wasted role).  Out of all the patients Gerhardt (newcomer Alan Tudyk) stands out as a German gay man with the best line in the film. When strapped in a climbing harness, he proclaims look at my package! Mike O'Malley, Diane Ladd, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Reni Santoni, and Azura Skye round out the other patients. At times, the movie seems to be a straight out comedy with laugh out loud scenes, but saunters for the majority as a serious film about the dangers of alcohol/drug abuse.  The cast is perfect and well rounded with newcomers and seasoned veterans.  Viggo Mortensen is in a wasted role as a addict baseball pitcher addicted to soap operas.  His place as a love interest for Sandra Bullock is addressed but never used. Betty Thomas directs without the panache shown in her past films like Dr. Dolittle and Private Parts, using techniques like vasoline on the camera lens to direct the viewer to the already centered character.  In places, the film seems like she just let the camera operator do whatever the hell they wanted.  Sandra Bullock delivers probably the best performance of her career to date.  She lights the screen up, even when she is flashing back to her drunken mother near death.  Susannah Grant, who also wrote the recently released serio-comic Erin Brockovich has written a wonderful movie full of laughs and tears, but falters with a stupid subplot about a soap opera called Santa Cruz which takes up several scenes in the film with it's Naked Gun-esque spoof of real daytime dramas. All in all, the film deserves good business at the box office. The storyline is very important and treated with respect by all those involved.  The film runs almost two hours, but still does not seem quite developed enough in some places.  A second or two after the credits start, a scene with a character from the soap opera seems stuck in at the last second for no apparent reason (Note the character in the aforementioned scene is wearing the exact same outfit as Sandra Bullock's character.  A little attempt at serious filmmaking or costume designer mistake?).  Even as a guy going into this movie expecting a chick flick, I was surprised at how entertaining it was.  I recommend.

The acting is great and the directing is tight. The film totally parodies the rehab clichés - the slogans, the camp environment, the wholesome songs, but the central character, sports columnist Gwen, also genuinely goes on a journey from adolescent-brained party girl to the more mature, intelligent woman inside. She's never stopped to reflect on her life and the consequences of her actions until now. The death of her teenage roommate from suicide is a compelling reminder that not everyone magically transforms their lives at rehab. The support cast including Elizabeth Perkins as Gwen's sister and Marianne Jean-Baptiste as a fellow addict, are great. As a counsellor and alcoholic, Steve Buscemi has a nicely sardonic way about him. He tends to spout sayings, but he's interesting. And as the troubled sports star attracted to Gwen, Viggo Mortenson has great chemistry with Bullock, and is self mocking and rueful. As Gwen's self centered partying boyfriend, Dominic West is fantastic -- his character manages to be light as a cloud while simultaneously representing the evil temptations of drink and debauchery that Gwen must avoid. Special mention goes to the troubadour Loudon Wainwright III who plays guitar and sings in several scenes, as a kind of one man Greek chorus. It gives the film an offbeat, wacky charm. Sandra Bullock is maybe too likable -- even when Gwen is doing despicable things (not that there are many of those) we forgive her. Maybe in real life such a character would really stir our hatred, like the gambling addict who steals money from her child's school. If Gwen had hit a person in the car she stole, it would have been a different film.

Lousy star-vehicle for Sandra Bullock, one loaded down with pop tunes to fill the gaps and an initially condescending view of rehabilitation patients as touchy-feely morons prone to singing and easy crying. Director Betty Thomas wants to have it both ways to cynically view the 12-step system through Sandra's eyes and also show that the system works in order to better Bullock's character. The film is a laughless morass ultimately tailed to its star (designed to show off her many sides, her sass and pathos, etc.), but Sandra Bullock as an actress runs hot and cold. I admired her star-making performance in Speed, and she was too cute for words in While You Were Sleeping, but she cannot carry a would-be weighty character study like this alone--and neither Thomas nor screenwriter Susannah Grant provides her with any help. Elizabeth Perkins plays Bullock's sister with a pinched mouth and a glare of disapproval, to show us how pity can evolve into hatred; however, this is hardly a person for Bullock's character to aspire to be. Perkins looks as bad off as her sibling, but with the caveat that she's been groomed with money. * from **** "},{"Title":"Bullock Drunk for 28 Days Would be Funnier.","Date":"2 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" 28 Days (2000) Dir Betty Thomas / Cast Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Steve Buscemi, Elizabeth Perkins, Dominic West Comedy about endurance and restriction of addiction.

It perfectly captures the entire process of rehabilitation...where the addiction took the person, the descent to rock bottom, the initial denial of the problem and that moment of clarity when the alcoholic/addict realizes that they are powerless over drugs and alcohol and become willing to do whatever it takes to get better.This is one of Bullock's strongest performances, playing a gamut of emotions that result from her initial frustration with her situation, her recognition of herself in fellow addicts, and most importantly, the realization that she can't live the way she did and hang with the same people she hung with before if she wants to stay sober. Steve Buscemi offers one of his most likable characters as the head of the rehab center, whose relationship with Gwen gets off to a VERY shaky start. Reni Santoni, Diane Ladd, Mike O'Malley, Alan Tudyk, Azura Skye, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste are solid as the members of Gwen's therapy group as is Viggo Mortenson as a former baseball superstar who has a brief encounter with Gwen. Mortenson is part of one of the scene's saddest scenes as his character is recognized during a field trip by a child fan whose adult chaperon figures out Mortenson's situation. Elizabeth Perkins also scores as Gwen's sister, who has one powerful scene during a family therapy session.Suhsannah Grant's smart screenplay and Betty Thomas' stylish direction are the frosting on the cake here...a clever and entertaining comedy that broaches some uncomfortable subjects but is effectively stemmed in realism.

People that are experiencing a 30 day rehab do not look good, clean-cut and made up. It is a shame that a film like this saw the light of day.

From that point, the movie starts moving in a more positive direction. Gwen becomes more agreeable and even perky, and comedy becomes more prominent (a highlight is a parody of a soap opera the characters have become fans of, and through much of the second half Gwen was punished by being required to wear a sign around her neck), though not everything is positive. Gwen has a boyfriend, but she meets Eddie, a good-looking pro baseball player.It would be easier to enjoy this movie by thinking of Sandra Bullock as a fun-loving person who enjoys making a fool of herself. Gwen, however, is a tragic character, and it takes time for her to become the likeable, charming, silly Sandra Bullock type person. At one point, it seemed we would see a new dimension to Bullock's acting skills, as Gwen reached a low point. This could have been a remarkable achievement, though it would not have been nearly as enjoyable as the movie turned out to be. As it happened, the movie didn't go on to do anything groundbreaking and it wasn't anything special. The second half was more entertaining.Steve Buscemi gave one of the standout performances. As Gwen's counselor, he was genuinely hard to like, and not particularly good-looking, if one likes to look at men. He was just what his character needed to be. The nurse who introduced newcomers to the facility also made quite an impression.I found the flashbacks to Gwen's troubled childhood annoying.

In the movie '28 Days', we get to see how bad it is for one woman to admit that she is suffering from &#145;alcoholism' and what steps she must take in her rehab to become &#145;better'. This movie shows that having too many drinks and a good time could cost you more than you can ever imagine!Gwen Cummings is a successful New York journalist who loves to have a good time. Trouble is, she can never tell when she has had enough. After a disastrous incident at her sister's wedding that earns her a drink driving charge, Gwen has two choices &#150; jail or a 28 day &#145;holiday' at a rehab centre to get her life back together. Naturally she chooses rehab, but after spending so long in the fast lane, this party girl is going to find out that slowing down is a lot harder than she thinks. While I am a fan of Sandra Bullock, the role that she took on in this movie shows me why she is such a good actress. She plays Gwen, a woman who loves alcohol, and cannot say no when it comes to a drink. I remember reading at the time this movie was released, that Bullock did some extensive research to get the right feel for her character, such as being involved in real life rehab meetings. I am sure that would have been eye opening for Bullock, but would also have helped her act like an &#145;alcoholic'.  Also the many different appearances that Bullock takes on in this movie, helps to show how sick her character really is. The movie opens cleverly with Gwen at a party, which is shot in such a way that we get the feeling she is totally drunk. When Gwen and her boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West), get home from the pub, the pair try to initiate sex, but we are shown to think the pair are too drunk to even get their clothes. Cut to the next morning which shows how dependant Gwen is on alcohol, as she cracks open a beer to start the day. Both she and Dominic are late for her sister, Lily's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding. After more grog, Gwen gets in trouble at the wedding and with the police. She then ends up at &#145;Serenity Glen&#145;, a rehab centre. This is where we get to see the fun side of the movie. The cast here is such a highlight, which includes rehab councilor Cornell (Steve Buscemi) who is not normally in such a role, but is very effective in what he says and does. Then the patients that Gwen is placed with give her a hard time, but for good reason. People such as Andrea (Azura Skye), Oliver (Michael O'Malley), Daniel (Reni Santoni), Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk), Roshanda (Marianne Jean-Baptist) and Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen), all have some sort of addiction, and come across as people that have struggled just like what Gwen will. In fact the varying degree of problems that these people have keeps the story fun and entertaining. The director of 28 Days was Betty Thomas (from &#145;Dr Doolittle' and &#145;The Brandy Bunch Movie'), and she encompasses many elements within this movie. The way she shows Gwen's struggles are most noteworthy. Then to have such a funny situation for Gwen to head into when she has to go to rehab, is even better. That is other good part to this movie, the script. Written by Susannah Grant, she put in some quite unique and intelligent themes. Also, considering that it was discussing such serious issues as &#145;addictions', I enjoy the comedic feel that was written into the movie. If this was done wrong then the movie could have been a failure. But it is again testimony to the actors who were put into their roles, because they were vital in getting the whole feel of the movie just right. There are many highlights throughout this film. Bullock's performance is one as I have mentioned. One of the more powerful scenes is when Gwen is heavily criticised in a rehab session by most of the group. I love how she responds, &#145; I'm having a bad day, I'm having the worst damn day, of my whole damn life, so if it is not too much to ask of you people, will you just back the F*#$k off'. What follows is hilarious. But we also get to see how &#145;sick' some of these people really are, and how they have to try and fight their way through difficult situations. What is also funny is the soap opera &#145;Santa Cruz' that was created for this movie. It is Andrea's favourite show, with the re-enactment of it in the film, for her release, another pleasing moment. Look I like this movie, I like it a lot. When it requires seriousness, you get it. When it requires comedy, you get it. Bullock was the perfect girl for the role of Gwen, and when you see her physically shake, like a real alcoholic, then you know her role was something special. I am sure that being a part of such an environment as that of &#145;Serenity Glen' would have to be daunting to say the least. But if these places can help people with any sort of addiction, then I believe it can only have a positive influence on the world. Yet I am sure there are many victims that cannot be helped, but that is the sad side of people's habits and addictions. I have also had my fair share of experiences when it comes to alcohol. For some time I gave up the &#145;booze'. Then late last year I gave alcohol another chance, and have not abused the privilege since. I know if I do, the consequences will not be that pleasant.

Upon her arrival she starts off in a bad way by injuring her leg whilst climbing down a tree to get a hold of the bottle of pills she threw out of her window. She gets rescued by Eddie Boone, a famous baseball star also a fellow alcoholic and a womanizer. The two start off a friendship, which starts turning into more, but Eddie's addiction makes Gwen turn away from him. Gwen refuses to acknowledge that sometimes she does need help and this causes problems between herself and her sister, who shared the same history of having an alcoholic mother.The comedy was there I must admit, but the movie had its serious issues as well with how people dealt with their problems. The cast was great and I still think Eddie should have punched Gwen's boyfriend Jasper around a little more. Also i was quite disappointed that Gwen and Eddie didn't end up together, but the script can't satisfy everyone now, can it? Viggo Mortensen was great as Eddie, but he could have had a few more lines in it and it wouldn't hurt if he SPOKE A LITTLE LOUDER. Sandra Bullock was awesome as usual and as for the rest of the cast, they did great too. Steve Buscemi was the counselor in the movie, but his talents were wasted, a little more comedy from him would have been good because I really couldn't stand to see him so serious so I'd say he was badly cast.

This is yet another film that's billed as a comedy but isn't.  There are moments (albethey small ones) of comedy, but that's all they are.One might pass off the failure of this film's comedic goal to bad writing (which would be a fair assessment as I would think it difficult to find humor on the topic of substance rehabilitation), but the director in question (and by her own admission on the DVD's commentary track) honestly fails to grasp what society finds and deems funny, as opposed to her own personal comedic tastes.  Whether this is due to hubris or lack of knowledge this viewer cannot say with 100% certainty, but performances given by the talent help to offset the director's lack of vision.An infinitely better film that tackles the same theme is a little known gem entitled Inside Moves.  This film deals with a man who tries to attempt suicide, and goes through the strain of rebuilding his life.  It is a touching film with comedic moments that leaves 28 Days eating dust in terms of performance, direction, writing, and all other elements that make a good film.  Inside Moves is the gold standard for what 28 Days was attempting.Sandra Bullock does a bang up job as usual, but Betty Thomas' buckshot-like direction cannot be counter balanced by a top notch actress like Bullock. One of the few highlights in this film is the acting.  Bullock's character is subjected to watching a Mary Hartmen-esque soap opera, and the soap opera is by far superior in comedic content than the actual film in which it is embedded.In short; if you like Sandra Bullock, then you might want to see this film one time.  Otherwise you'd be better served with another movie.

Because 28 days never seems to know precisely what it wants to be a comedy or a drama?The film begins as an amusing comedy in which Sandra Bullock, drunk as she truly is, ruins her sister's wedding by falling over the cake and crashing the limousine in a nearby house.  She's then given the choice of going to prison or joining a drug and alcohol rehab center.  Although she chooses rehab, she's still very persistent ... only due to the fact that she refuses to admit she has a problem.This is the moment where the film changes atmosphere and becomes somewhat gloomy and a lot more serious.  Sandra Bullock's 'drunk and inconsiderate' character is very miserable now, but as time goes by she'll realize that this place is here to help her and that this is probably the only way to ever get a normal life again.  Despite the drama of Sandra Bullock being locked away against her will, there are still a few jokes around the corner to keep the film from becoming too heavy.As usual, Sandra Bullock is very amusing.  She's got great personality and she plays her role beautifully.  There are only a few people I can think of who can switch so easily from a comic to a dramatic performance and back again like she does.

But director Betty Thomas decided to be somewhat naive, giving us a PG-13 version of what should have been a much darker film.  Nevertheless, it does give us some insight, and does have some moments of truth.  And Bullock's credible performance as an alcoholic helps hold it together.  I admire Bullock a lot as an actress--she is very charming and very beautiful and very talented--but she does tend to play a lot of the same roles.  She's never tackled a real character role, but what can you expect out of someone who has mostly romantic comedies under her belt.  This is pretty much the most unusual role for her.  Though she is still playing the sweet, charming Sandra we've grown to love, she also makes the abusively alcoholic side of her personality well-known.  Hell, not all alcoholics are depressed, suicidal jerks (as Hollywood tends to melodramatically express to us).  Her character is a happy, free-spirited party animal--aren't we all?--but she never knows when to quit.  And the you-know-what hits the fan when she ruins her sister's wedding and gets into a car accident. The supporting cast is good as well, with such talents as Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Elizabeth Perkins, Viggo Mortensen, Alan Tudyk, Reni Santoni, Mike O'Malley (hopefully, his movie career will fare better than his TV career, b/c he has good potential) and Azura Skye, who plays a role much more complex than her shallow role on the short-lived WB series Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane.  And I forgot to mention Steve Buscemi as a former drug/alcohol abuser, who is now a counselor.  A much more mild-mannered, subdued role for him.  I have to admit, I enjoyed him more as the motormouth in Fargo and Reservoir Dogs, but it's always nice to see actors do something different. Bullock's character arc is believable, and I do feel convinced when she comes to the big realization that her life is a total disaster b/c of alcohol.  But by the third act, Betty Thomas tries too hard to create a series of happy endings and have the audience go Awwww.  The sentimentality goes way too far, and it just feels forced.  I guess she didn't want the film to get too dark, and basically she wanted to be able to market it as a comedy.  But you can't make a movie about addiction and expect to end on a fine-and-dandy note.  You have to be dark.  You have to sacrifice the comic relief.  I enjoyed the humor, in some cases I was on the floor laughing, but in some cases it just seemed unnecessary. 28 Days is a fun, entertaining, well-acted film that's worth recommending, unless you're in the mood for a serious film about addiction (watch Permanent Midnight or Basketball Diaries).  But the one thing I have to admire is the movie isn't preachy about its message--that's the key.  The film never wanders into Just Say No territory.My score  7 (out of 10)        "},{"Title":"fantastic!!!!   !WARNING THIS IS A BIT OF A SPOILER!","Date":"28 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  SANDRA BULLOCK IS THE BEST ACTRESS IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!

The one strong element of this movie was Sandra Bullock, who grabbed a very weak role and breathed life into it so well that this movie is actually watchable in spite of its other flaws.  But, those flaws are pretty bad and seriously hurt the quality of the film.IMDB lists Susannah Grant as the screenwriter.  Ms. Grant wrote Erin Brockovich, a reasonably good film, but I'm more inclined to suspect that this movie was written by a computer program.  You've seen it all before. Andrea (played by Azura Skye doing a really good Winona Rider impersonation), is the young room-mate who is so obviously doomed.  The rehab center is loaded with an assortment of personalities, sort of like the Cantina in Star Wars.  There's the nice guy who seems smarter than anyone else, but must deal with his problems.  There's even the standard road trip scene.  Every element of this movie was stamped from the standard rehab/mental ward scene book.  You can just stop in every ten minutes or so to resynchronize yourself and you'll know everything that is going on.The acting in the center is awful.  Alan Tudyk does a ghastly job of overacting Gerhardt, the German.  Many of the other characters are walkons and have no dimension to them.  The only character that almost made sense was the sister, but even she got reduced to a speech in the end.  Steve Buscemi has an interesting opening scene as Bullock's counciler, but quickly gets shoved to the side.  Towards the end of the movie they actually turn down his voice during a scene.  Talk about being written out...What is really sad it that this could have all been fixed so easily.  They should have cut the entire first part of the movie and the boyfriend completely.  Start the movie when she rode up to the rehab center.  All of the rest of that was just a waste of time.  The boyfriend existed mostly for temptation purposes and addicts don't need any help in that department. Then, take the script and have someone read it and on ever page predict what is going to happen (it will be quite easy).

I think the best best movie about the problem of alcoholism is Mike Figgis Leaving Las Vegas. 28 days is somewhere between these two movies. But there´s a big difference to Leaving Las Vegas. Ben - the character Nicolas Cage played - had GIVEN UP the hope to stop drinking. By the way this film had a more pessimistic and disturbing mood, while 28 days is a tragic-comedy and starts from another point. Gwen´s whole life is a party. Drinking is like a hobby for her. She DOESN`T EVEN REALIZE that she has a problem and it lasts a while until she recognizes it. Wake up! Be honest to yourself! - maybe that sounds banal, and maybe it isn´t that easy, but in my opinion this was the message of the movie. Some people criticized that it´s too soapy. In my eyes, it´s not.

An obvious attempt by Bullock to stretch her acting wings a bit--nothing wrong with that, actors and actress should see if they can do different things. The movie itself is another installment in a long line of substance abuse movies--and is not among the great ones, like The Lost Weekend or The Man With The Golden Arm. But neither is every war movie The Sands of Iwo Jima nor every western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. So what do we get? We get a solid effort by Bullock, who's a very appealing actress, though she tends to be more effective in the comedy scenes than the dramatic ones--still there's talent there. The writing is probably the biggest weakness in the movie The menagerie at the rehab center, where she must dry out, is from Stereotype 101. A crotchety older man, a bad ass black woman, an alienated teen ager, an effeminate gay man, a frat boy type who won't grow up, and a frumpy motherly woman. Hollywood isn't known for originality, but come on, this is ridiculous. The rehab center itself is absurdist--they chant in places, evidently for those who don't like the serentity prayer, and everyone smokes. I'm not sure why trading in one addiction (alcohol, pills, heroin etc.) so you can chain smoke cigarettes is such an improvement. They make some of them wear signs around their necks like fraternity hazing--I don't know if that's done in real rehab, but if it is, time to check into a different clinic. And oh, they visit a farm and pal around with barnyard animals. It seems like all of that is to try and cover up that not much really happens at this rehab--just a lot of people sitting around asking each other how they feel every ten minutes. But there are some laughs, and I think Bullock is engaging enough for the audience to care what happens to her. I though Buscemi was wasted--or didn't much care about the role, since as a counselor he was essentially monochromatic. Viggo Mortensen wasn't given a lot to do, but played a drunk ball player pretty well.

Does anyone in the movie really care?  28 Days had much potential.  I see in this movie the potential of movingly portraying 12-step type program recovery.  But it simply does not measure up to this potential.  First off, it (the writer, the director, the actors, everyone?) doesn't (don't) know whether they want to treat this whole business of recovery as something to take seriously or just something to make fun of.  True, recovering from addiction doesn't have to be all serious and there are no doubt many times in recovery when a sense of humor is necessary, but that is not the kind of thing going on this movie.  The comedy in 28 Days, in my opinion, works to trivialize the potential genuineness of the recovery scenes.  An example of this is the short documentary-style interview scenes with some of the characters in recovery who can't decide whether to open up , make of fun of themselves, or say a lot of really illogical things that make them seem shallow and unbelievable. Sandra Bollock's character, Gwen, is the best example of this schizophrenic portrayal.  The flashbacks of her growing up with an alcoholic mother are powerful, but we never really get to see her confront those feelings in the movie.  Instead, we get to see her watch Santa Cruz.  In fact, none of the characters are ever really shown confronting the childhood wounds that got them to this place.  Therapy sessions are treated shallowly.  There's lots of people violating each other's boundries--people having sex, people making fun of each other, etc.  Maybe the director and writers thought this stuff was funny, but to me it was just stupid, and worked against the potential message in the movie.Sandra Bollock seems like a strong actress.

The character of Bullock is not fleshed out very well (nor any other characters for that matter) - we just know that they were all addicts of some form or another.  The other rehab patients are so bizarre they belong in an asylum, not a rehab center.  Totally unbelievable, and generally over the top in any of their roles, the characters in this story need serious work in order to be even remotely believable or interesting.  Bullock is believable, but surrounded by these characters, you hardly even notice.This movie is below average, and that's a shame for someone as talented as Bullock.

Although a merely competent actress, Sandra Bullock has a light sweetness about her that can really work if she's got good material. Her performance here is not exactly Oscar-caliber, but it is solid, film-ancoring work. She is Gwen, a cute, hard-drinking writer with a cute, hard-drinking boyfriend, sad memories of a dead mother and a sister fed up to HERE with her behavior. After she wrecks the aforementioned sister's wedding and a limo into a house, she's shipped off to rehab. There she must tackle a no-nonsense counselor, a bevy of weird fellow patients, her own belief that she doesn't 'have a problem', and later just trying to get by in the world while sober. There are touches of humor, but this is definitely a drama and- oddly enough- one that feels about 10 minutes too short, which is rare.

Speed 2 Cruise Control and Forces With Nature were both serious flops with critics around the globe, and she hasn't been very well respected for a long time. But, this will be the film that puts her on track. 28 Days is a well-made and thought-provoking film that is much better than it looks, and it deserves a wide audience.Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is a New York writer who just can't say no to drink or drugs. After crashing her sister's wedding car and ruining her wedding cake, Gwen is ordered into a rehabilitation centre, where she spends the next 28 days. At first she doesn't have much respect for the centre and tries to escape, but as her toxic levels come down, she gradually realises that maybe she can turn her life around.The plot may sound lousy, but it isn't. It deals with human emotions properly and in a moving way, and 28 Days is able to put a smile on your lips and make tears come out of your eyes. Bullock is a stunner in this film, she is perfectly cast as Gwen, while Steve Buscemi is as brilliant as he always is, no doubt about that. Azura Skye, who co-stars as a friend of Gwen's, lights up the screen in an ignored performance which deserves praise. Susannah Grant, scriptwriter, seems to have a thing for making good actresses come back to their great standards. In the same year of release as 28 Days, Grant wrote Erin Brockovich, a brilliant legal drama that made Julia Robert's get the career-best nod. Now she can fix Sandra Bullock, and this could very well be Bullock's best film.It has it's problems, some major ones, but 28 Days remains a worthy watch for all ages. I rate 28 Days 7 out of 10.

Set in a rehab clinic this movie fails to do three important things necessary for entertainment value.  It fails at its few attempts at humor, it fails at to create an atmosphere of real drama, and most importantly it fails to create a real connection between the audience and the main character (Sandra Bullcok).  At the end of this movie I realized that I just didn't care what happened to her or any of the characters in the clinic.  The supporting cast, which included Steve Buscemi, did absolutely nothing for me; especially the foreign character who likes to call attention to his package.  The worst aspect of this film, however, was how the clinic operated.  Patients constantly chanting motivational propaganda that obviously none of them believed.  There was as much of this mindless chanting as there was legitimate dialogue. The one bright spot, however, was Sandra Bullock.  Her portrayal of an obnoxious drunk was not only believable but also entertaining.  There is one scene where she completely looses it in group therapy that is very dramatic and in my opinion the most powerful scene in the film.  While I hesitate to call this movie a complete failure I would definitely not suggest it.  If you want to see a movie about obnoxious drunks rent Leaving Las Vegas!

I believe that she's an underrated actress.  She should be getting more and better scripts and she should be as famous as other great actresses such as Michelle Pfeiffer or Cameron Diaz.  Sandra Bullock has always been very convincing as an actress.  Because she plays all of her parts so naturally and emotionally, it's become impossible NOT to like her.  And on top of that, she's a very beautiful woman.  So even if the film isn't any good, you can still hold on to that everlasting beauty of hers.  Either way it's always a pleasure watching a Sandra Bullock-film. But in this case the film isn't bad at all.  The storyline is good and although this is a drama, there are multiple scenes that are quite amusing.* POSSIBLE SPOILERS *The story is about a couple (Viggo Mortensen and Sandra Bullock) that is addicted to just two things parties and alcohol.  They hardly take responsibility for their actions and they spoil other people's fun.  The film begins with Sandra Bullock who is late for her sister's marriage.  This is bad, but things get worse - much worse!  As drunk and disorderly as they are, Sandra Bullock ruins the wedding by falling onto the wedding cake.  In order to make up for her mistakes, she decides to buy a new wedding cake.  She takes the limousine and the next moment she's drunk-driving with the purpose of finding a cake store as soon as possible.  But instead of doing that, she has an accident and destroys the front of a beautiful house.  This incident is the straw that breaks the camel's back.  She has to enter a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre.  At first she's very persistent and annoyed with the rules of the centre, but when Steve Buscemi (who is in charge) threatens to send her to prison she's willing to co-operate.  From that moment on, she really tries her best to get a grip on her life and to forget about her alcohol addiction.  She's even making new friends at the centre who'll support her if necessary.  Her relationship isn't getting any better, because she's changed a great deal and as a result of that she's become a different person - and he is still the same alcoholic.  When she's released from the centre, she's determined to live a normal and healthy life.  She will no longer live the life of an alcoholic.  It's time to take responsibility for her actions and to take control of her own life.  Because her friend is still an alcoholic who's now very dangerous for her (since he intends to bring her back to the ONE life she intends to leave behind) she decides to leave him; and she doesn't regret it.  So, a happy ending after all.Overall the acting performances are good, but Steve Buscemi and (especially) Sandra Bullock are quite outstanding.  This is, I believe, Sandra Bullock's best performance so far.  The storyline (as mentioned before) is good and very original too.  This film could have easily been just another dark and serious picture based upon true facts.  Instead, it's become less dramatic because of several amusing scenes and a fine-looking Sandra Bullock.  The special camera-effects (used to point out that Sandra Bullock's character is drunk or feeling nauseous) are quite good. All in all, this is a much better film than I expected and you WILL be entertained for the whole time being (whether you are drunk or sober).

These self-styled critics need to remember that, unless they know the actors personally, they can't know whether or not the actor is being themselves, acting a role totally different from who they are, etc., etc.  Unless an actor totally ruins the picture for you by speaking wooden lines and generally being entirely out of character, I just have to smile at some of the egotistical comments I see written about the talent of others.Ok, I'm off my soapbox.

Most places aren't as nice as this one.  So, obviously this was considered to be an upscale rehab.  That explains the characters.

Unfortunately, the presentation of the story was lacking and it detracted from the film's overall effect.  Director Betty Thomas and writer Suzannah Grant (who scored with the screenplay of Erin Brockovich) can't seem to decide whether they want the film to be a zany comedy or a serious drama.  They seem to have been aiming for a bittersweet comedy, but they missed the mark.  They trivialized the good dramatic elements of the story with numerous inane scenes, many of which were more ridiculous than funny.  The film also suffers from an excess of clichés, some overemphasized to the point of being stupid..  It is difficult to take much of the story seriously with all the foolishness that is continually erupting.  The result of this miscalculation was that the film was hammered at the box office, with the gross ticket sales failing even to match production costs.  That's a pity because a lot of people missed an excellent dramatic performance.Sandra Bullock was a ray of sunshine that burst forth from this otherwise jumbled mess.  Sandra simply out-acted and outclassed the entire cast and did a terrific job despite the `nutty institution' approach.  This is something of a departure from her accustomed romantic comedy roles.  She had a chance to flex her dramatic acting muscles here, portraying a very confused and distraught character.  She went from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows and handled the full range of emotions beautifully.  It was one of the most complete dramatic performances I have seen from her to date.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of Bullock's portrayal.  Without her, it would have been about a 3/10.

She also seems to be hooked on painkillers. After ruining her sister's wedding, then stealing a limosene and drunkenly crashing it into a house, she (although this is not shown in the film), is sentenced to 28 days in rehab as an alternative to jail. In rehab, she meets some interesting characters with various addictions, and eventually starts to own up to her problems and begin her recovery.The rehab characters, who each curiously show us about 30 seconds of insight, seem promising, but what we learn about them is vague.  The lame chanting in the rehab center is silly, in that it is never explained why people buy into it so readily.  At times the film played like an educational video about the dangers of alcohol/drug addiction, but even falls short there, as the center clearly is lacking in addressing some areas of treatment. Some performances are decent, while others are not so good.  What happens after the 28 days are up, are we to simply assume what her life is going to be like?  The film seemed better suited as a TV movie, really..I could keep nitpicking, but I think you get the idea.

Anything new? This is simple entertainment with little point other than the predictable social values concerning addiction and pressure. With a story-line very similar to Girl, Interrupted, this movie takes a completely different and certainly more flippant approach. It seems directly targeted to a 'nice' audience and lacks the hard-hitting angle of other films which address drugs such as Trainspotting, possibly for fear its audience will not be able to handle anything too 'hard-core'. Movies such as this allow us to touch from a distance a world generally looked down upon, coming away undisturbed. We are able to feel morally superior to addicts without feeling the need to become emotionally involved. As it contains very little distressing subject matter, it is an ideal piece of entertainment for those who dislike being removed from their comfort zone, whilst having the surface appearances of a 'poignant' film. With the classic comedy lines, the mild romance and Gwen's (Sandra Bullock) quirky rehab. companions, it lightly flings aside the serious topic of alcoholism, and seems to designed more to provoke smiles than thoughts, leaving us with an `Aww, how sweet.' attitude. One of the movie's rare highlights had to be the unusual role Steve Buscemi played - that of the insightful, no-nonsense counsellor, Cornell. Susannah Grant's script -writing skills were not shining their brightest here, with the over-done characterisation of Gwen's new-found friends and the outdated portrayal of a gay guy, nevertheless both Steve Buscemi and Dominic West (Jasper) rose to the challenge of raising the standard admirably. Sandra Bullock and Azura Skye did not have to travel far from their traditional roles to meet the needs of the regretfully undemanding director, Betty Thomas.

The way the movie switches between the seriousness of substance abuse and the somewhat comic nature of the addicts at the rehab clinic gets kind of confusing at first because you don't really know if the movie is trying to make you laugh or listen, but ultimately you learn to accept all the characters as human beings, whether they're supposed to be comic relief or not.After reading some of the comments posted here on the IMDB, I have no idea why some people expected a movie about an alcoholic woman going to a rehab clinic to be a laugh-a-minute comedy.

The movie has no focus; it's not a comedy, nor a black comedy, and it doesn't have the emotional weight to be called a drama.

The movie succeeds at something very few movies achieve, a perfect blend of comedy and drama. Though it does get a little overly dramatic towards the end, '28 Days' is easily the star's best film since 'Speed'.	The subject could've been handled a million different ways, all of them with seperate results, but the way it was tackled here gurantees the best time watching it and the top commercial returns for the studio. It is never very heavy, also bouncy and energetic, with an absolutely hilarious mix of quirky characters. There isn't much to the plot, but the movie belongs to the characters, who keep the whole thing enjoyable and fun.	The end could have used a lot of work, and the character of Jasper (Bullock's boyfriend) isn't portrayed evil enough (for lack of a better word), he just appears to be enjoying all life has to offer, and for that the end puzzled me.	It is a great movie to immerse yourself in, so just put all your troubles aside, drive down to your local theater (or video store, depending on when you read this) and see it, it's easy to recommend, and a lot of fun to watch.7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Very Funny, Average Plot - Possible Spoilers","Date":"27 April 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  This Betty Thomas directed film is very funny. I laughed out loud at several points, but the plot has too many holes to fill.ATTENTION  possible spoilers, although I'll try to make my point without too much of this, Just Beware.One of the plot holes is that the people who are at this 28 day rehab when Sandra arrives are still there when she leaves. Not just those who leave and return before she leaves.  Many of them are there the whole time.  This needed more development.  Secondly, Viggo Mortensen puts in a great performance as Sandra's confidant but they never really wrap this up.  Since they aren't wrapping it up, why even include it?  He could have left the movie, and one of the other characters do the little traits he offered and we would have had a better ending.  The character development of Sandra's character was quite shallow for this type of movie that is supposed to explore how things earlier her life life brought about this stint in re-hab. It seemed like they kept re-hashing the same 3 events in her life.  Somehow I have a feeling that more than just 3 events drove her to alcoholism.  They make it seem like she is just drunk because her Mom was always drunk. HOW LAME.  There is always more to it than that.Sandra's character says that she is a writer and that writer's drink.  Well, this is a surprise that she has a job as a writer which we find out 45 min into the movie.  Losing her job was never a concern when leaving for re-hab, it just looks like she is living on family money or something.  The only reason to bring writing into it is so she can write a mock soap opera for her roommate.  VERY WEAK. It just wasn't developed enough.These uneven plots have become the norm in Hollywood.  However, at least they managed to make a drab story about re-hab funny and entertaining.  All of the other clinic patients were pretty funny.  They all watched a totally hilarious soap opera spoof on T.V.So that raises the movie score up to a 5 of 10.

Ensemble casting was good (wish they had given Diane Ladd a bigger part), and all actors were strong enough to be believable, especially/even Bullock.

Didactic.","Date":"23 April 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  After dragging my girlfriend to the abominable Mission to Mars, we were due for a chick movie, and this one didn't seem like it would be too bad. Sandra Bullock is likable and there would hopefully be some Cuckoo's Nest-like characters to provide comic relief. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case.After a quick sequence demonstrating what an irresponsible drunk Sandra's character is, she's deposited in front of a rehab center for 4 weeks in lieu of prison (where she belonged, in my opinion). Note, however, that her drunken antics are cleanly portrayed with no consequences other than this rather inconvenient interlude in the country. This is not the type of drunk who is shown passed out on the floor in a puddle of her own sick or who wrecks the car, killing a family of four. After all, incidents like this might give her the impression that she really needs help, which would nullify the meagre emotional journey that the character undergoes in the course of the movie.No, our heroine arrives at the rehab center utterly unwilling to believe that she needs treatment or that she is just like the other inmate of this asylum. Of course, the initial impressions we're given of the rehab center portray it in as dehumanizing, humiliating, and infantalizing a light as possible, like a summer camp for addicts. The other inmates are forever indulging in group singalongs of Lean on Me and chants of 12-step ditties, are continuously prodded to articulate their feelings, and are forced to wear humiliating signs around their necks that contain a counselor's impression of their primary problem. As the audience is given a tour of this geek show, we are beaten over the head with the message of this movie Will our Sandra will ever come to accept the teachings of these good rehab counselors, see the error of her ways, and become a happier person? What do you think?Of course, we are then introduced to the other patients of the center, and what a quirky lot of characters they are! This is where the incredible predictability of this movie becomes so overwhelming. You know what is going to happen to almost every character about four seconds after they appear on screen. Oh, look, a deeply troubled teenage girl heroin addict. Do you think something bad will happen to her? Here's a nasty, negative man who resents Sandra's presence in the group. Do you think he'll eventually develop a grudging respect for her? There's a funny-looking German guy with a heavy accent. Do you think he'll be anything but comic relief? And there's a gorgeous hunky baseball player/addict. Do you think maybe he and Sandra will be attracted to each other? And here's yet another scene of Sandra trying unsuccessfully to perform some inexplicable act with a horse. Do you think that maybe she'll finally succeed at the end of the movie, to symbolize her progress towards a life of sobriety. From this point on, you're just watching the formula play itself out, as you mentally check off the items on your list of events that have to occur before this damn movie ends.Overall, the portrayal of substance abuse in this movie is very mild, almost to the point at which you wonder whether it's really necessary for these people to be stripped of their dignity and individuality in order to be cured of it. Of course, Sandra (as always) is supposed to be likable here. It would be a totally different movie if there were real consequences of her drunken antics other than embarrassment. She mentions very rapidly, in passing, that she once left her godson in the car for five hours while she went drinking in a bar, and yet she arrives at the rehab center completely unwilling to even admit that she has a problem.Ultimately, the film has trouble deciding whether it wants to be a comedy or a serious portrayal of addiction and recovery, and as a result, it fails on both counts.

Well, those who have actually undergone the seriousness of the disease can probably tell you, seeing as a recovering alcoholic I know told me, the element you need the most is most likely a good sense of humor. Otherwise a lot of people couldn't get through it. The person I know who is a recovering alcoholic also told me that the film did a beautiful job in portraying the events that occur during withdrawal, etc. When Gwen (Sandra Bullock) throws her Vicatin pills out the window, then climbs on the tree to retrieve them, she sees an image of herself sitting at the window watching herself with pity. The same exact thing happened to the recovering alcoholic I know. Screenwriter Susannah Grant (who also did an excellent and tasteful job scribing 'Erin Brockovich') obviously got to the core of what goes on during withdrawal of an alcoholic who doesn't think they're an alcoholic, or who refuses to admit it. But the humor is an element that everyone needs, especially in cases of crisis. Gwen stumbles in a drunken stupor to her sister's wedding, late, with her also drunk boyfriend. She manages to topple onto the wedding cake, ruining it, and also saying some regretful things during a drunk toast to the bride and groom. After destroying the wedding cake, she says to her stunned sister/bride, Don't worry. I'll replace it. She stumbles into the Just Married limo and takes off, swerving in and out of oncoming traffic, swerving into a yard, veering out of control, smashing over a lawn jockey and to top it all off, driving straight into a house. Needless to say she is sentenced to either jail time or 28 days of rehab. She takes the rehab, with much reluctance. The humor in this opening sequence is one of the things that attracted me to the film. It's funny because it shows just what fools drunks can be. And all you can do is basically pity them and laugh. When she reaches the rehab center and sees the members holding hands and singing Lean on me, she quickly dials up her boyfriend in desperation They, they CHANT! She is searched and registered and put in a room with a doomed young woman, played by Azura Skye. It's a long time before she comes to settle down and allow herself to take part in the rehab. But she does it. And her bitter sister also tries her best to forgive, but can't at first. The film had a great mix of drama and comedy, in the right places. For me, the funniest parts were early on, when Gwen denied and denied her addiction and snarled at everyone around her. She finally at one point snuck out to the nearby pond and found a man with a couple cigarettes, and begged him for one. The man watched her light it up and said, You know, if your counselor catches you with that you could be in big trouble. She replies, I don't plan on discussing it with him! He stares at her Too late. This leads to her insisting she can control her addiction If I wanted to! I can...I CAN! I CAN! He doesn't believe her. So she throws her relief pills out the window...but can't make it for very long. One of the best lines from the script that didn't end up in the film is when her  sister walks up to her, after she has reached the wedding drunk and late and says calmly, When you're sitting home alone on holidays with nothing to do because you've alienated everyone in your life, just remember, you make it impossible to love you. Gwen's sister later restates it You make it impossible not to love you. 28 Days is a great film, which deals with a very serious problem, but also is smart enough to know to add the much-needed humor aspect of the whole situation.

The 12-stepping of America is now such a noisy, public process that those who've never been within 50 miles of a rehab center may feel as if they can anticipate everything that happens to Sandra Bullock in 28 days. At the beginning we see Gwen Cummins (Bullock)in full full, degraded celebration mode guzzling a few wake up brewskies and showing up late for her sister's wedding. By the time she is done inflicting her damage, she has driven a limo into someone's house, and is ordered in lieu of jail time, to spend four weeks at Serenity Glen, a sprawling woodland detox-and-rehabilitation compound where the motto is Mind Body Spirit. At first we take in the soft soap communal scenes through Gwen's eyes - the righteous, skeptical armor of her denial. Even without booze to light her up she's a firecracker, exploding in defiance at a world which refused to live up to her wishes. Bullock gives it her all - she's bristling and alive on screen in a way she hasn't been before. What's missing from her acting is what's missing from the movie - namely, a deeper more probingly confessional sense of Gwen's demons - of what precisely, the escape of alcohol has meant to her. In 28 days there is plenty of squalid bad behavior, most of it depicted with engrossing honesty. But we don't get close enough to the inner trauma from which it emerges. It's as if the movie itself had already been through rehab.

But this film is actually one where the audience will relate with Gwen and her dysfunctional life.  Some of the funniest moments are cringe-inducing in their familiarity.

In my opinion, it's somewhere in between. They are neither victims or demons, and as one other reviewer pointed out here, they choose to be what they are. No one forces it upon them. It's through their own fault. Take films such as Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream. Both of these films are about heroin addicts, but the characters don't obtain our sympathy because they either choose the life out of boredom and frustration, or because they are greedy and reckless. Those films generate our sympathy for the characters through different ways, but the bottom line is they DO manage to obtain our sympathy. This film starring Sandra Bullock about rehab is one of the first of it's kind that I've seen. I'm no expert, but I've always imagined rehab to be a pretty dreary and depressing place - almost like prison - if your an addict trying to kick something - but this pretentious and unrealistic film doesn't know whether or not it's trying to make a hard-hitting emotionally and honest drama, or a stupid light-hearted comedy. It tries to be both, and ends up been a horrifying and stupid mess that just tells us how it's director and writer didn't have the grapes to make a depressing, honest real-life film.Bullock plays Gwen, an alcoholic who enjoys life with her binge-drinking party animal boyfriend. She doesn't realise she has a problem- she is just enjoying life as far as she is concerned. But when she arrives at her sisters wedding and gets drunk and after she destroys the wedding cake and makes a degrading and embarrassing speech that could ruin the marriage that is only hours old, she steals a limo and drives recklessly before crashing it through the front of someone's house. It's a miracle that she doesn't injure or kill anyone. The judge gives her an ultimatum - go to prison or go to 28 days of rehab. She picks rehab, thinking it will be a picnic. But how wrong she is, because when she gets there, she realises how messed up her life is and she is now determined - after an escape attempt - to set herself straight.Probably the only merit I can see in this film is a brilliant performance from the great Steve Buscemi (Resevoir Dogs, Con Air, Heart). But unfortunately, his screen-time is limited. Bullock is completely out of place here and seems to get so self-absorbed with her role that she subsequently becomes her contemptuous character. The script is awful, and goes all over the place. One minute it's a serious drama, and the next it's a light-hearted housewife comedy. To even have considered making a comedy out of such a serious subject would be suicide. I know of a few people suffering from addictions, and it's definitely not something that can be made a joke of, or even worse, made into a light-hearted affair like this disgrace that Betty Thomas and Susannah Grant have churned out. I'd recommend avoiding this film, especially if you have suffered from addiction through it yourself, or through a close family member or friend. I rate both Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream 10/10, because those films portray addiction for what it is, how it destroys lives and ruins relationships......28 Days is immature and never seems to know what it's trying to do. The film tries to pin the root of Gwen's addiction onto her troubled childhood and her drug-addict mother. This is insulting if anything. A lot of people come from broken homes. That has nothing to do with them developing addictions, in fact, you'll find that many addicts come from privileged and comfortable backgrounds. Addiction has nothing to do with where you come from. It's to do with who you are. No one is there for you in the last garrison, it's just you and you are the maker of your own decisions, and in the end only you have your back when it gets so far, and only you can be blamed.

She is a brides main for his sister and destroys the reception, steals a limo and crashes it into a house and then to save jail time she goes to rehab. In rehab she takes it as a joke, but when being around other people and facing her addiction head on she is able to leave knowing what she must do to get what she really wants out of life.I admit movies about drug addiction can sometimes be uplifting and important, but this movie really never focused well on the problem, just the solution.. Its difficult to make people truly see how horrible it is to be an addict when you portray their addiction in a funny way. Although drunk and pilled up, the opening scene of her crashing the reception was more comedic than tragic. The party was a yawnfest and they brought life to it. Drug addiction is serious and it takes more than just the lightweight procedures used here to beat that addiction... I didn't buy it and didn't like it...Writer Susannah Grant can write good she did an amazing job writing Erin Brockovich, but that was based on true events, maybe original and true depictions of life isn't her forte.Acting wise Sandra Bullock has never impressed me, I can't recall ever seeing her actually act. She plays the same boring person in every film she's ever done. Viggo Mortisen was a nobody when this came out, he had been in a ton of movies and no one had paid him any attention, here he once again was lame and boring.. It was his last film before peter Jackson would make him a household name, and several years before David Cronenberg would actually teach him how to act.Steve Buscemi did'nt have much of a huge part here but Steve is always great, he is one of the most real actors out there. Many of the actors did fine, but I think Alan Tudyk was hands down the best actor and the true star of this film. He was actually making me laugh, and making me feel something. There is one part where he does a confession using the fork in the road as a metaphor and he completely improvised the entire scene and he was just wonderful. Lots of the supporting cast did a great job.The ending of the movie Bullock comes home and back to her old life, she soon realizes if she wants to stay clean she needs support, and she walks away from her boyfriend and broke the tie. To me that was the best scene of the film and I applauded that and people in real life who can shake their demons, it's not easy...That scene helped boost my rating up to a 3 star out of a possible 10. I can't say this is anything more than a dry drama, but if you like dramas this might be for you.

After crashing a wedding limo, which she stole, into a house a judge makes Gwen enter a substance abuse program instead of sentencing her to jail. Like many addicts, at first Gwen denies she has any type of problem, but she prefers the clinic to prison so she goes to the facility. At first Gwen is a very difficult patient but eventually concedes that she has a problem and begins to work to get better. This picture mixes fairly serious drama with humor, as Gwen both owns up to her predicament and interacts with a comic cast, including Mike O'Malley, to gently poke fun at the situation which Gwen finds herself in.

The characters are right out of a high school assembly morality play, featuring a broken down athlete, the depressed teenager, the gay guy, and Miss life of the party herself, played by Sandra. there are no real surprises, and the only mild shock of the film is deadened by a trial run through earlier in the movie. Other than that, it's paint by numbers plot time. Steve Buscemi attempts to bring some credibility to the proceedings in the thankless role of the rehab counciller, but gets steamrolled by throwing out the same useless bromides every actor who plays this role has to run through. Maybe this was an attempt to do for rehab clinics what Pretty Woman did for prostitution. I'm just shocked Betty Thomas actually directed this. I've always found her work to at least have some spice to it, but not here. Then again, what can you do? America's sweetheart gets drunk and goes to rehab........whoop de doo.....

Girl, Interrupted was pushing it enough barely a year ago, and to have another of virtually the exact same movie come out already is just too much. Besides that, you have to consider the fact that the only really good movie of this kind ever made was One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and that was 25 years ago. The unlikely events that lead up to Gwen's (Bullock) arrest and sentencing to a rehab clinic were farfetched to say the least. Anyone who casually decides to borrow a limousine while falling-down drunk after having fallen through her sister's wedding cake would never have made it to that age without winding up in prison for a serious alcohol-related felony. Instead, it's like Gwen was dropped onto the Earth in her present state and began tripping all over herself trying to learn the rules of the society that she suddenly found herself in. The romance that she develops with Eddie (Viggo Mortensen) and the one that falls apart with her intensely alcoholic previous boyfriend together make up the element that is in virtually every single movie of this kind. This was probably the least original part of the entire film, as well as one of the most boring. However, Steve Buscemi was very entertaining as one of the counselors at the rehab clinic (although this was a very uncharacteristic performance for him &#150; remember The Wedding Singer? How about Armageddon and Desperado?). As a whole, 28 Days is predictable, routine, fairly boring, and ultimately disappointing. I didn't expect much from this movie because it deals with a very sensitive subject, so obviously it can't be much of a comedy, and there is little left to be done in the area of the rehab drama, so even though drama is the only thing it can really be, chances are that it will just rehash something that has been done many times before. And unfortunately, this is what it did. Although Sandra Bullock delivered a pretty good performance as someone who suddenly awakens to the pathetic life that she has been leading, she was totally unconvincing as the drunken partygoer that she tried to portray in the first part of the film. Die-hard Sandra Bullock fans (and I've heard that they do, in fact, exist) are sure to have a blast. Everyone else might do better to go straight for the '75 classic, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.

When she turns up drunk at her sisters wedding, falls into the cake and then steals a limo before crashing it into a house she is taken to court for DWI. In court she is offered 28 days in rehab or jail time, she opts for rehab and checks in even though she feels she doesn't have a problem. Despite initially treating the others as freaks and mocking the clinic she receives a wakeup call when she drinks and faces jail. Offered a second chance she becomes broken over time.My wife bought this film because she like Sandra Bullock. I thought I'd watch it with her, unsure what it was about (at first I was quite surprised that she'd bought it as I thought she meant 28 Days Later!). So we settled down. At first I assumed it was a comedy as it was directed with a light, almost care free touch and the atmosphere was one of party and comedy drunkenness rather than Bullock sitting my herself in a council flat weeping and laughing! And so it continued, and this is the film's flaw - it makes rehab out to be difficult, but ultimately a good laugh if you can get past these little issues. The odd time it does have some strong moments (the daughter confronting her mother over what drugs do to her is one) but mostly these are twee moments that sit uneasily between light, amusing scenes where Gwen bonds with her fellow rehabees.While the comedy is OK it is never really laugh out loud funny. It keeps an amusing air to the film which is enough to sustain it but this damages it too. With such a serious issue why did the film need to water it down? The serious issues are acknowledged but they are not properly or respectfully followed through, the question needs to be asked why the film couldn't have still had the comedy but gone for a more respectful approach to the issues (One Flew Over kept going through my mind - moving AND funny).The characters in the film are interesting but pretty poorly drawn. On the addict side we have characters whom little is known about apart from their addiction. Even with Gwen, all we really see of her is a party girl who breaks but is still sassy. Yes we learn some stuff about her Mum but nothing that helped me feel for her character. Respect is due for Bullock trying to do something different from her usual stuff but she didn't wash with me as an addict - even when her hands are shaking and she is going nuts, she still looks good and didn't convince. Buscemi is more believable as he has the look of a man who has been there done that etc. Sadly he is limited in screentime. I found his presence ironic as his smaller budget look at a person who is ruined by drink was much better (Trees Lounge). Mortensen is OK but plays it all quiet and serious but does it The support cast are a mix - mostly they are just comedy characters who only show signs of being broken addicts when they are asked to do the emotional scenes and just mess around normally. Jean-Baptiste is a good actress but only has one scene to show it, plus her American accent is only OK, but her talent is wasted.  As a slight fan of his, I did find Loudon Wainwright III's cameo to be of interest if little value.Overall this film will likely satisfy neither camp but is average enough in both to be passable. The comedy is not funny or clever enough to save the film, but it is enough to take away from the serious side and make that element feel devalued. It barely works as a comedy and doesn't really work as a film dealing with bigger issues. It is watchable and instantly forgettable but you can't help but feel this could have been much better.

Bullock likes to drink way too much and she has the classic alcoholic symptoms, believing that she is not nearly as bad off as others know she is. At the clinic she meets a wide group of characters, some very silly (Mike O'Malley, doing basically his routine from television's Yes, Dear) and some very dark and mysterious (Viggo Mortensen of The Lord of the Rings fame). Mortensen is really good in this film, but it is near impossible to make a connection with his under-developed character. Steve Buscemi also seems wasted as the counselor at the facility. A film that is way too funny and way too serious at the strangest of times to be a complete success. Only average by the finale. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

First, and most surprising, is the fact that Sandra Bullock actually holds this film together.  It is the first time she's produced a serious performance since, uh, ever.  Even better is Steve Buscemi, who, unfortunately, doesn't have nearly big enough of a part.  A final plus is the fact that the film's heart is in the right place, even if it is misguided.Which leads me to the negative.  28 Days attempts to tackle an incredibly heavy topic, but only with limited success.  Primarily, there is a single reason for this, and it is because the film tries to be both a comedy and a drama at once.  Few films pull this feat off very well (and they are usually romantic comedies), and 28 Days isn't one of them.For example, the film goes to great lengths to demonstrate just how bad off Bullock's character really is, but it doesn't stick with that direction.  Within the first five minutes of the film, she's destroyed a house and ruined a wedding - and she doesn't seem to care.  Unfortunately, this does little to foster audience sympathy for Bullock, but that's besides this particular point.The way I see it, if the film really focused more on Bullock's dark side, it would be better.  But, alas, the movie adds several one-sided stereotypes that apparently are supposed to bring comic relief; all of them are distracting and only serve to rob the film of any power it might conceivably have.  There's the angry-screw-the-entire-world type, the soap-operas-are-the-key-to-happiness-teenage type, the celebrity-baseball-player-playboy type, and let's be sure not to forget the eccentric-foreign-accent-man type (I particularly hate him).  In other words, I couldn't care less about any of them.  In fact, the only character outside of Bullock's that is even remotely interesting is Steve Buscemi's counselor.  However, Buscemi's character is introduced, given more background than any other character in the film including Bullock, then dropped by the wayside completely.  In my opinion, 28 Days could have been much more interesting had it analyzed a relationship between Bullock and Buscemi, but, hey, what can you do?A final complaint.  Director Betty Thomas seems to have attended the Blair Witch Project school of directing because every time Bullock's character has a flashback (which is often - let me say that again - often), the camera shakes as if the cameraman were suddenly overtaken by some sort of seizure.  This same technique occurs during the unreadable opening credits.  I'm sure Thomas is trying to make some sort of statement on alcohol's effect on memory and motor function, but she's not telling me anything I don't know and IS making me noxious.Still, overall, despite my numerous complaints, 28 Days is watchable, and this is, again, largely due to Bullock's performance.  Nevertheless, though, you could walk out of this movie and decide you want a drink, and I don't think that's the effect the filmmakers were aiming for.  5/10 "},{"Title":"Is it a bird?

The outright comedy trivialises the hellish experience of rehab, and while it would have been kinder to laugh with the characters that appear, you end up feeling you're laughing at them. Problem is - the things that are happening to them aren't actually all that funny.Bullock is cute and has her trademark grace and charm, but somehow she seems like a caricature of herself, lacking the grittiness and edge of a real alcoholic. Her dark is always sugar frosted and brightly lit, and never the pitch black of a real suicidal drinker.Alan Tudyk is outstanding as Gerhardt the gay German, and gets some of the best lines. Steve Buscemi has just the right air of seen-it-all-before detachment as the counsellor, and Dominic West plays the seductive rogue boyfriend with real style and conviction. The rest of the cast does a good job of holding things together, including a quirky and effective cameo from Loudon Wainwright III.But while the writing and directing remain strong, they're also oddly unfocussed, and this pulls the movie down. Extreme heart warming moments follow on from extreme self-abusive nastiness, follow on from extreme camp humour. You're left spinning your wheels, unsure which direction the movie is going.Ironically, the best part of the DVD release is the cameo appearance by the soap opera Santa Cruz. In the film itself the soap plays a bit part, when it should have been given a starring role all of its own. The DVD has a full sequence of Santa Cruz, and it's side splitting - easily the funniest part of the whole package.Overall then, this is not one of Bullock's best movies. Worth watching on DVD just for Santa Cruz, and for some of the funny set pieces. But otherwise the film limps awkwardly between comedy and drama. Trying so hard to both well means it doesn't really manage to do either.

It's not the kind of story I ever want to watch and I wouldn't have watched it but for the star Sandra Bullock. She does a splendid job in this movie as Gwen slowly learning to live a normal, decent life and finally ditching her useless addict boyfriend.Viggo Mortensen is also excellent as the baseball player Eddie in rehab. We first see him as the Knight in Shining Armour when he has picked Gwen up after she's fallen out of a tree through trying to get at her drugs. He's missing for much of the movie even though flagged as a major character. He acts as the guy who clearly likes Gwen and she likes him - there's great empathy between them - and makes Jasper jealous when Jasper turns up unexpectedly and sees them standing very close - one of the best moments in the movie is when Eddie justifiably socks objectionable Jasper on the jaw for insulting Gwen, and it's amazing Gwen doesn't cheer Eddie on instead of withdrawing from what had seemed to be on the way to a good friendship, much to Eddie's obvious disappointment. But it's clear Gwen is faithful to Jasper the jerk right up until, after assuring her he'd change just as she has, he tries to get her into another drink-drugs situation. At last, with great dignity, Gwen dumps him.I was totally mystified by just what the purpose is of the Mortensen character. He and Gwen seem to get on very well, but suddenly they are totally estranged and he's clearly feels unable to approach her. I just couldn't see why! Finally, as she leaves, he does approach her and points out, wisely, that Jasper is no good for her. Next time we see him is as the titles play when a new guy arrives for rehab, acting just as Gwen did initially not at all keen to be there and convinced he's amongst freaks. Eddie says hello to the newcomer, who glares at him as though Eddie had made some disgusting approach and flounces off ill-manneredly, leaving Eddie looking upset. If there was some nuance in this that I ought to have comprehended, well, I didn't! This was I thought the most interesting relationship in the movie and I wanted to make sense of it and can't.A couple of other characters are particularly interesting - the foreign young man (German?) who Gwen meets post-rehab in a most moving little scene, and Gwen's room-mate who so tragically overdoses.An amusing sideplot is the take-off of a simply dire soap opera. Eddie's the only addict to start with - it had to be the most unlikely person, but once his secret is out, day after day more and more people are riveted with deadly seriousness to this utterly awful (but to us viewers hilariously funny) drivel.

Of course, movies are designed to entertain more often than enlighten, so when Hollywood makes a movie about rehab, you've got to figure that their target audience contains people that have never seen the inside of a rehab clinic. Meanwhile, the people who have been through rehab certainly wouldn't want to suffer through this shallow dramedy anymore than they'd choose to reenter rehab. Moreover, they'd probably throw up at the sight of Sandra Bullock trying to act not only as a drunk but also a funny hiccup drunk. What else could you possibly expect from a mainstream movie aspiring to make millions about subject matter that most people abhor? Happy drunks have always been more fun to watch than reformed relics who have learned that the bottle holds booze better than they ever could. Consequently, life before recovery is a blast in 28 Days, but life afterward is the blahs. Neither director Betty (Dr. Doolittle and Private Parts) Thomas nor scripter Susannah (Erin Brockovich and Ever After) Grant achieves little symmetry between the two so that 28 Days is anticlimactic.In this strictly superficial account about substance abuse, the souses have more fun than the sober. The best scenes in this entertaining but unexceptional yarn feature Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock of Speed) not only colliding with his sister's wedding cake but also later car-jacking a stretch limo and parking it in the living room of a house in the suburbs as she searches for a cake to replace the one that she destroyed. (Anybody who has had a drunk careen into their house with a car problem probably won't sympathize with our heroine.) Gwen dismisses her own drunken shenanigans until the legal system packs her off to Serenity Glen, a cozy North Carolina rehab clinic to dry out for four weeks. The formula screenplay about a party gal-in-limbo resembles a pallid but grown-up version of Girl Interrupted. This flaky, often funny ensemble cast soaper lacks the emotional depth of the Winona Ryder epic. Nevertheless, despite its gallows humor, you know from the get-go that 28 Days never takes rehab seriously. A serious rehab dramedy would have put its starlet through the ringer. Instead, the only people who have a tough time are the supporting cast. Sadly, interesting as the supporting cast is, none ever makes more than a sketchy impression.Most of the action occurs in the sticks at Serenity Glen. When Gwen arrives, she finds herself surrounded by a cuckoo's next of inmates that chant, hug, hold hands, bare souls, and sing silly songs. In other words, character actor heaven! Eccentric characters populate 28 Days, ranging from an antagonistic ex-doctor, Daniel (Reni Santoni of Dirty Harry), who pumped his own stomach to curb his alcoholism then performed an emergency tracheotomy on himself, to a sissified gay German dancer with a cocaine problem, Gerhardt I Alan Tudyk of Serenity in Peter Sellers' glasses) who chews the scenery. Fleshing out this circus of misfits are Bobbie Jean (Diane Ladd of The Cemetery Club), dysfunctional southern housewife, Andrea (Azura Skye of One Missed Call) a teen junkie with a death wish, Oliver (Michael O'Malley of Leatherheads) a womanizer, and Roshanda (Marianne Jean-Baptiste of Spy Game) an African-American mom who drug addiction has alienated her kids.Predictably, Gwen refuses to confront her own addiction until her offbeat counselor Cornell (Steve Buscemi of Reservoir Dogs), an ex-junkie himself, threatens her with jail time. At that point, 28 Days seems like 28 Years as we watch Gwen struggle to redeem herself while the others around her chart heir own courses of self-destruction. The closest character comparable to the Angelina Jolie rebel in Girl, Interrupted is Azura Skye's heroin-dependent teenager. Not even her tragic demise casts a shadow over this comedy. Meanwhile, Gwen bounces between two guys, her bacchanalian boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West of 300) and Eddie (Viggo Mortensen of the Lord of the Rings trilogy), a baseball pro with a whole league of problems. Eventually, Gwen straightens up, with a little help from her ascetic sister Lily (Elizabeth Perkins of Must Love Dogs), and she emerges clean and sober. The protagonist's plight can often be gauged by the obstacle course that they tackle. The Sandra Bullock character has an incredibly effortless time kicking the habit. The worst thing that happens to her is that she falls out of a tree. She fares better than either Meg Ryan did When a Man Loves a Woman (1994) or Lee Remick did in Days of Wine and Roses (1962) with Jack Lemmon.Susannah Grant's screenplay strains credibility. Although some of her dialogue triggers gales of laughter, the premise that women like Gwen could draw a mere 28 days in a posh rehab center after her antics seems improbable. What judge would possibly dismiss grand larceny and DWI as easily as the one you never see in this movie? Again, when Gwen's tough-minded counselor decides to send her off to jail, she pouts and reforms.Director Betty Thomas leans on comedy like a crutch so that 28 Days gets neither too depressing nor too realistic. Again, the only thing that salvages 28 Days is its gratuitous gags. The Santa Cruz soap opera bits are hilarious, especially those tiny clusters of brain tumors. Obvious allusions to M.A.S.H. with its loudspeaker humor about alcoholism and rehab are cute remainders that imitation qualifies as the sincerest form of flattery. Surprisingly, Thomas pokes fun at womanizing. Every good movie winds up on a high note, but 28 Days ends on a low note. Clearly, Thomas never saw one of the funniest but more realistic rehab comedies ever made where staying sober beat staying sloshed Stuart Saves His Family. Altogether, 28 Days implies life is a bore when you aren't bombed.

Life to Gwen and her boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) is just a fun filled exercise in debauchery; stumbling from bar to night-club to hangover, until, Gwen's alcohol-fuelled display at her sister Lily's wedding results in a drunk-driving charge and a court order to spend 28 days in rehab. Determined she does not belong, Gwen refuses to conform to the unique set of rules and rituals she is faced with. It's only through the relationships she forms with the other patients and her counsellor, Cornell (Steve Buscemi) that she begins to realise there may be more to life than being the life and soul of the party.Sandra Bullock's performance as Gwen was average compared to her other movies. The movie in general was pretty entertaining, but nothing great. Bullock was strong in her performance as Gwen but it was not powerful enough to create an impact. However, it was strong enough to allow her to carry the movie alone - the other members of the cast all performed well but I felt their roles were not large enough. The only problem I had with '28 Days' is that the movie seemed to flit between comedy and drama. Humour was added during the serious moments and vice-versa, causing the end result to not be as good as it could have been. I felt '28 Days' should have stuck to one of the genres rather than switch constantly between them.

She mentioned that Steve Buchemi was in the film, so I figured that I would give this film a shot. While 28 Days was a pretty good film, it didn't quite capture me as well as Girl, Interrupted did. I guess because it seemed like the script writers were pointing us into two directions with some different situations and the ending just seemed to well, end.Basically, Gwen is an alcoholic that unfortunately has ruined her sister's wedding and gets into a bad car accident forcing her to either go to jail or rehab, she choose rehab, but realizes that it might be too cheesy for her to handle, so after some resistance, she finally realizes that it's now or never and just deals with it, but learns that she has good friends and is finally discovering who she truly is.Well, the plot with Gwen and Eddie just seemed to point us in different directions, while Eddie in some ways helped Gwen out, I don't think his character was absolutely needed. But it was kind of a nice touch with Gwen bumping into her friend at the plant shop, in some ways it was just so realistic and touching to see that one last smile.

But when I first saw the film, I was shocked at how much I really enjoyed it. Sandra Bullock and other great actors such as Steve Buscemi and Alan Tudyk gave the film abit of life. This helped because I think the movie was at risk of being too serious and without any humour. Sandra Bullock did a marvellous job of playing her role as Gwen. We've seen her in other more comical roles such as in 'Speed', and it was refreshing to see her successfully play a more serious role but also keeping us interested with small humorous moments throughout the film. Overall, I recommend this film to any Sandra Bullock fan or for film lovers who always watch the same comedy stuff over and over. I found it to be thought-provoking but also funny at the same time. The only downside to this film for me was the relationship shown between Sandra Bullock and Steve Buscemi's characters in the film. I hoped to see more about their relationship, bonding moments etc. But was let down by the lack of it.Basically, if you have a habit of watching the same kind of movies all the time. This will refresh you. It's sad but also sweet, and with many great and comical actors. I give it a 10/10,and I give Sandra Bullock a 10/10 for her great performance, Well done Sandra Bullock!.

Don't let that put you off though. A lot of the jokes were actually very funny, mainly verbal jokes, and there's also a great spoof of a long-running daytime soap. Sandra Bullock is supported by a great cast Azura Skye, Alan Tudyk, Dominic West, Steve Buscemi, Viggo Mortensten, Mike O'Malley, Marianne Jean-Baptise...there are also some others I probably forgot.Most people will find the direction and music are nothing special, but I found it okay.

After watching this movie, I agree 28 Days does seem to show a realistic and positive look at recovery (but I don't work in that field, so how can I be totally sure!?)We're first introduced to Gwen, played by Sandra Bullock, who is an alcoholic party-girl that wrecks her sister's wedding, crashes into a house while driving drunk, and then sent to rehab.  Immediately, I dislike this character, especially when she was so disagreeable and in denial at rehab.  However, I guess this is probably an accurate portrayal of a character going through something like this.Nevertheless, the movie progresses, and you start caring for the characters and rooting for them to succeed.  Aside from Gwen, other interesting characters include Andrea (a young teen who is addicted to heroin and to a soap opera called Santa Cruz), Eddie (a retired baseball player played by pre-Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen), and Cornell (a former drug addict and current counselor played by the great Steve Buscemi.  This movie is a welcome change for Buscemi, as he is playing a character that isn't psychotic in any way.)There were some characters I didn't care for though, like Oliver as played by Mike O'Malley.  Mr. O'Malley is a fairly funny guy, but I don't think he has the comedic chops to carry the humor of a feature film.  I also found the character, Gerhardt, to be more annoying than funny.  Most of the time, I couldn't even understand him!Overall, 28 Days falls short on a few big aspects.  It's supposed to be a drama-comedy, but there aren't many laughs, and when there were dramatic/traumatic moments, I found that I didn't really care.  However, I will give 28 Days much credit for an accurate depiction of rehab and the type of characters that go through such a trying moment.My IMDb Rating 8/10.  My Yahoo!

Sandra Bullock carries this light, comedic effort with her usual breezy comedic charm that carried her in Forces of Nature with Ben Affleck. Ms. Bullock is always cute, has a good command of comedic timing and is pleasing to look at and she does this well in 28 Days. The movie tries to give her a romantic interest in the person of Viggo Mortensen who gives a deft and more serious performance as a famous baseball player dealing with his own 28 days more seriously, but the romantic attempt never takes off.28 Days tries but fails to deliver it's message on the serious issue of substance abuse.  There are some clever, funny moments, but then the film does an 80 degree turn around with the (warning movie spoiler about to be revealed) death of Bullocks' 17 year-old roommate of a drug overdose.The movie goes a little overboard with sappy sing-a-longs when a client/patient is released.  The good doctor in recovery is a repeat customer with a whiny disposition and some cynical humor.  Diane Ladd's role as a recovering addict is stilted and she is much too good an actress to have taken this role. The last 15 minutes of the movie is the best part of it and gives the viewer a little more intense, inside look at recovery.If you want light hearted, entertaining comedy with no redeeming societal value from it's title, 28 Days is for you - as Ms. Bullock is always pleasing to watch regardless of what role she is playing.  If you are looking for answers, Girl, Interrupted has a more in-depth look at institutional life without it being totally about substance abuse but having much more meat to it.  The film never touches on the intense emotional ride that detox implies and the pain a substance abuser goes through is never quite revealed here .  Notable performance but not a big stretch for the talented and versatile Steve Buscemi, the hardest working actor in Hollywood.

I've always liked Sandra Bullock.  I've not always liked her vehicles.  I didn't care for Hope Floats or Forces of Nature, but I kept hoping she'd get back on track.  She certainly did, here! 28 Days manages to tread fairly well along a difficult line.  It has a serious subject (addiction) and it doesn't short-shrift or trivialize the subject.  At the same time, it brings out the humor, by letting the humor derive from the characters themselves.  That's how you make a serious movie with a deep vein of humor.  You don't add pratfalls or clever lines.  You let the humor evolve from the characters themselves, as they react to the situations they're in.  The use of flashbacks can be awfully dreary, but in this movie, they are used properly and to great effect.  The ensemble cast works side-by-side with Bullock's complicated yet compelling character.  Things are explained, but you aren't beaten over the head.  The ending is perhaps just a tad sugary for my tastes, but Sandra's fine acting manages to make it work,any way.  Sandra Bullock has the potential of being a truely great actress.  She's pretty, but not so pretty that it gets in the way (This CAN happen, believe me.  Would you believe that Cameron Diaz could have played this role?) Moreover, Bullock will allow herself to look a bit ugly, as she does early on in the movie.  It's amazing how many truely beautful actresses, won't! (Personal note Sandra, you've gotten just a little too skinny and muscular.  I'm happy that you're obviously fit...but there's not a thing wrong with just a little more body fat to give you a more normal appearance...just a thought, dear lady).   Any way, Bullock's abilities aside, this movie will provoke you to think about addiction differently.  It shows you its compelling side, and displays clearly why some people wallow in their addictions.  It also honestly shows that coming back from serious addiction is truely not easy.  Yet, at the same time, you will fall in like, if not in love, with many of the characters, and come to hope with them that they will succeed.  This is the CORE of the movie, that makes it work. In a character-driven scenario, you must come to empathy...and I believe you will. Sandra, it's good to have you back.  Make more like this one!!!

I'm not trying to be snide or sarcastic-- but what little bits I know of recovery programs and AA and similar 12-step programs, this seems to accurately portray at least one version of the crash and burn phase of substance abuse, followed by the denial, struggle, and so on as the addict attempts to regain a life.And while all of that is KIND OF a special interest for an isolated audience, it is also human enough to be a compelling story for most movie goers. Sandra Bullock as an actress (not as an actual  human being) also seems to be tracing some sort of redemption here as well. The character she plays spends the front third of the movie as a vain, selfish, and thoroughly annoying spoiled little p***-ant. Much like the vapid and annoying characters she played in Speed 2 and Forces of Nature. Then she (the character, that is) turns herself around and begins to dwell somewhat in a real, human, and meaningful way-- much like the innocent, vulnerable, and realistic characters that made her a star in the first place (e.g., see Speed, Wrestling with Ernest Hemmingway, and The Net).One interesting note-- as I sat in theater in the third or fourth week of the film's release, I noticed that the audience laughed, aha-ed, and chuckled along with plot points and remarks on screen that had completely passed me by.  At any rate, there seemed to be lots of in-jokes. But I never felt excluded. I was happy for my fellow audience members' enjoyment, even if my participation was perhaps more superficial.I still liked it, although I must admit I didn't LOVE it. I was happy for Bulluck, whom I have respected and admired in the past.  Overall, a good job. I gave this movie an 8 out of 10.

All I knew was that it starred Sandra Bullock (one of my favorite actresses) and that it was a comedy. Well, turns out there's a whole lot more to this film.28 Days is more the psychological drama than the conventional romantic comedy. Anyone hoping to see Sandy reprise her While You Were Sleeping character will be disappointed. Her character, Gwen, is supposed to be a journalist, but really her forte is alcoholism and pill-popping, which she utilizes when she ruins older sister Lily's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding by showing up drunk, knocking over the cake, and crashing the limo. The courts decide that Gwen must spend four weeks at a rehab center called Serenity Glen, where she is surrounded by kooky characters (portrayed by some very talented actors such as Alan Tudyk, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Reni Santoni, Diane Ladd, etc.) who chant and find Lean on Me appealing. This is where most of the story takes place, as Gwen must learn, with the help of the other 12-steppers as well as concerned counselor Shaw (Steve Buscemi), that people who go through life sober can be very, very happy.What struck me initially about the film was that it began with a psychedelic, confusing opening scene involving drink, dance, and sex. Gwen and Jasper, her sometimes charming, mostly loathsome beau (Dominic West), dance to The Clash's Should I Stay or Should I Go, and I instantly wondered if the two old women in the audience with me were enjoying themselves. Later instances of this psychedelic, psychological trip into Gwen's mind involved memories of her mother, whose motto was If you're not having fun, what's the point? These scenes are shot very well, in a painful to watch yellowish tinge (whose function is to make the memory painful), and hopefully Sandra will receive some Oscar consideration later this year when the Academy Award nominations are announced. At times I thought I was going to cry (which I rarely do), because I felt exactly how Sandra felt during her scenes staring at her own reflection in the mirror, feeling loneliness and the sense that her present is due to actions she'd made in the past.  I must also commend the direction of Betty Thomas, who made a seemingly run-of-the-mill romantic comedy into a serious case study into the lives of people, regular people like you and me, living with addictions.The supporting cast is wonderful, especially Azura Skye as Gwen's teenaged roommate Andrea, whose addiction includes heroin and a soap opera named Santa Cruz; Viggo Mortensen as a baseball pitcher spending twenty-eight days of his own at Serenity Glen; Alan Tudyk as a funny foreigner whose various quips add humor to the mostly serious story; and Dominic West as Gwen's boyfriend, whose addictions are even worse than Gwen's, though he seems to know how to handle them. But this film belongs to Sandra Bullock. When Lily tells Gwen in the beginning of the film, You make it impossible to love you, over the course of the film you'll find yourself falling in love with Gwen, and with Sandra Bullock. Considering her earlier films Speed, While You Were Sleeping, Forces of Nature, etc., you're quick to conclude at the end of this one that this is Bullock's best film to date. She's beautiful and talented, and when she cries, you cry. Bullock has this kind of glow about her only a handful of actresses possess the power to affect those around her even with a simple smile or blink of the eyes or nod of the head. There is no way you can leave the movie theater without feeling affected by Sandra's performance. Gwen is witty, beautiful, amusing, etc.; the possibility of loving Gwen/Sandra is tremendous. By film's end, you'll conclude that this is Sandra's best performance to date, and that this is her time to shine.

Let's be honest  He looks like a (recovering) junky.Gwen's roommate, a 17-year-old heroin addict, now addicted to chocolate and soap operas, appears to have everything going for her until she realizes that life on the outside is considerably worse than being institutionalized.There is a lot of pain in this movie -- but it is guilty of what Buscemi's character accuses Gwen of in their first one-on-one interview  If you use humour to deaden the pain it ceases to exist; or at least you can bury it so deeply it is hard to find.If anything this movie handled the subject of substance abuse too lightly.  YES, there are some disturbing scenes -- but they could have gone much farther.There supporting actors were all -- without exception -- wonderfulJasper (Dominic West) as Gwen's enabling boyfriend becomes the man you love to hate; Diane Ladd as the woman whose husband left her with only a bottle for company and solace.  Gerhard (Alan Tudyk) as the token gay guy was the only piece of directing I would argue with -- he was just too 'fruity;' especially with the accent he was burdened with that was very nearly a lisp.

The reviews I had read pretty much slaughtered the thing, and I was ready to give my own 5 cents of how Sandra's career was going downhill with bad movies and worse acting. Alas, seeing this movie was obligatory, because Sandra WAS pretty cute in Speed, and has later achieved a rather nice spot in my video collection.Elizabeth Perkins' appearance in this movie also appealed to me in a very nostalgic way, as my memories drifted back to our little lunch together back in 1997... (see Who Turned The Switch in Spontaneously Combusted Literature 2.4 for that story)So here I was, all set to slaughter the movie, with Perkins-nostalgia and Bullock-watching as my only excuse to actually see the thing. And two hours later, I left the theatre in a state that could probably be compared to heavily intoxicated, happily skipping my way up Avenue Road in the drizzling rain. Who needs a cab, it's just water, for crying out loud!Did they give me a bad batch of coke at the consession stand? Did I sit down next to Sandra Bullock herself in the back seat of the theatre? In my dreams. No, I was just overly-positively-wonderfully surprised at what a great movie this was, not to mention the fact that I had just seen one of Sandra's best ever acting jobs. And not only that, it was definitely one of the most meaningful movies I have seen this year, and the director has certainly had an eye for details.My conclusion was that the raving drunk critics who didn't enjoy the movie and completely missed its hillarious moments, were too focused at their own feelings of guilt for their heroin addiction. You know... Who do they think they are, they don't even know me! That sort of thing.This movie will definitely find its way to my DVD collection, and for that reason, it also receives the same rating. In addition, you should also see it on the big screen, and it should be obligatory viewing in all middle schools. If you're already done with middle school, go see it and buy it anyway.

It's both, because that's how it is when you or a loved one is addicted and struggling with rehab. My siblings and I can't watch this very often, because it's simply too right-on at points. A particularly electrifying element is the series of Gwen's flashbacks of her childhood. Sure, there are flaws - as adorable/yummy as he is, Viggo Mortensen's character is actually a caricature - but they're slight. Bullock captures the vulnerability of the outsider feeling perfectly, whether at a family gathering, rehab or a social occasion, as well as the boorishness that often accompanies trying-too-hard efforts. Other characters are not as fully developed, which is perhaps the greatest weakness of the movie. I suspect this is due to uneven editing, because those with more camera time are real.

A few scenes later she'll make a startling discovery-she's one of them. Rehab centers are places people go when their lives are just fine. The ones who recover are the ones who decide finally that they belong in rehab. 28 Days is the story of Gwen, who's never known any other world than `having fun' and boozing. `If you're not having fun, then what's the freaking point?' is the question her drunk of a mother would often ask she and her sister, Lily (Elizabeth Perkins).Gwen took this phrase much more to heart than Lily and it all comes to a head at Lily's wedding, when Gwen shows up late and drunk. Things deteriorate from there, in disastrous fashion, and she is given two appealing choices rehab or jail. Bullock's performance, her best ever, paints a picture of someone who is no longer in control of her own life. The scariest part is that she has no idea how bad things have gotten. She's drunk so much of the time, she can't remember her most embarrassing moments. When she can remember, she has to drink to deal with the embarrassment. It doesn't help that her boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) visits her, brings her drugs, and tells her that nothing's wrong with her If she can just stick it out and get through the program, she'll be out and partying with him again.28 Days has what you'd expect in a drug rehab story A cast of quirky characters of which the main character seems the most `normal'; a journey of self-discovery marred by one setback after another. Overall, it's what I'd call `under-dramatic.' Once Gwen passes a certain point in her recovery, I never felt like she was in danger of slipping back to using. This is what we're supposed to be afraid of, that the right set of circumstances could push her over the edge, but I never bought it. There is more than enough here to make this a strong film, though. Susannah Grant's writing (she also wrote Erin Brockovich) is smart, believable, and apparently well researched. Betty Thomas' direction gives the film just the right look and tone.

I fail to see how upbringing makes Gwen a victim of addiction , she volunteered to become a drunk driver , let me spell that out for the hard of thinking  She V-O-L-U-N-T-E-E-R-E-D to get drunk , she V-OL-U-N-T-E-E-R-E-D to drive her car while drunk .
