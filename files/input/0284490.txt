What director, Tom Dey, has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of buddy comedy and the media. Early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks How is this different from Cops?, when Chase Renzi is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with De Niro's character, Mitch Preston (hilariously boring name by the way). That's when I saw it in a new light that I hadn't previously noticed.The idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them. De Niro's reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with Murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of. You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself asking Why would I do another movie playing a cop? Chase Renzi is portrayed to be a Hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again, she is merely doing it to save her job. She somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that. One line says it all Who doesn't want to be on TV? Maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film, merely set to entertain, but it does give it a little spin that I hadn't noticed before.As for Murphy. You got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous. Trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with. Murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting.The plot with the gun is of course pretty boring. The action sequences are nothing special, except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew. One thing that I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star. George Michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spin.So, I trashed it the first time around but what the heck; if you are gonna do this, why not point out how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy took a big chance doing this.

De Niro and Murphy portray two LAPD officers who are recruited to be the central `characters' for a new `Cops'-type reality TV show, wherein a camera crew will follow the two on their appointed rounds as they chase suspects, round up criminals and, all in all, make the streets of LA safe for the common, decent citizens who reside therein.  De Niro's Mitch Preston is a reluctant participant in the series, while Murphy's Trey Sellars is a wannabe actor with stars in his eyes who sees this as his golden opportunity to make it big in show business.The initial problem with `Showtime' is that it feels more like a `high concept' exercise than an actual movie.  Despite the fact that there are a number of funny moments in the film, too many of the scenes fall flat both as comedy and as action drama.  The saving grace is that De Niro's understated cynicism provides an effective counterpoint to Murphy's over-the-top enthusiasm, resulting in just enough comic tension to wring laughs out of even the weakest of material.  It is a joy to watch these two pros at work and they are nicely complemented by Rene Russo as the driven TV producer whose brainchild serves as the excuse for the story.  William Shatner, playing himself, also generates some laughs, often at his own good-natured expense.Yet the film itself is a failure.  One of the prime dictums of the screenplay is to try to show the discrepancy between police work as it is portrayed on the screen and police work as it really is.  In fact, the film opens with veteran De Niro instructing a class of elementary school children about the mundane realities of life on the job.  Yet, the film betrays its own theme by itself indulging in all the inane shoot-em-up and car chase scenes it is supposed to be satirizing (the scenes are not exploited for comic effect, which might have lent some much needed satirical bite to the proceedings).  Even worse, the `serious' side of the story, involving drug deals and gun running, fails to generate any interest or suspense.Oh well.  De Niro and Murphy are such likable comic actors that the movie, for all its many weaknesses, manages to whiz by without inflicting too much boredom and pain.  `Showtime' is a completely forgettable and innocuous little time waster, but fans of these particular actors will at least appreciate their efforts.  "},{"Title":"A new kind of Cop-Buddy film","Date":"14 August 2002","Score":"11 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" SHOWTIME(2002) (3/5stars)Starring ROBERT DE NIRO EDDIE MURPHY RENE RUSSO And WILLIAM SHATNERIn the new cop-buddy film Showtime, Robert De Niro plays Mitch Preston,  a tough NYC cop, who in the opening credits distinctly points out that being a cop is nothing like the movies portray with their clichés . Eddie Murphy plays Trey Sellers, a cop who dreams of acting in films. After Mitch shoots out a TV camera at a crime scene, a network executive (Rene Russo) decides that they will sue the police department, unless Mitch agrees to be part of their new reality based cop show. When Mitch is forced to become part of the show, he ends up getting Trey Sellers as a partner. Trey is nothing like Mitch. Trey is goofy, doesn't follow standard police procedures, and doesn't take his police work seriously. Mitch is the exact opposite. So here comes the average cop-buddy film, right? Two opposites, forced to work together, who in the end patch everything up and become best friends? Not exactly.What makes Showtime different from the rest of the cop-buddy films in the genre, is that the whole situation is different, and is not exactly what you'd expect. Never before has a cop-buddy movie had the officers followed around with a camera. So with this in mind, this movie might be great, right? Again, not exactly.The problem with Showtime is, it could have been so much better. The camera really could've gotten some funny stuff. But in this film, instead of focusing more on the fact that they're constantly being filmed, most of the film we don't see the camera man following them. We see them at home, or talking about things, doing things. We never see the camera man with them. The film focuses more on what it's like to be followed by a camera, instead of WITH a camera. What I mean by this, is that we are shown footage of how Mitch and Trey react AFTER filming. It's like a celebrity bio. We see them behind the camera, their ordinary lives, and how they cope with paparazzi and spotlight. However, in Showtime, that's not what we want to see. We want to see the camera chasing them the whole way through the movie. We want to see Mitch and Trey react on the spot, dealing with the camera THERE and THEN, not later. It would be so much more of a fun movie, if we could just see Mitch and Trey, the whole time being followed on the street, getting into funny situations instead of what Showtime gives us-a look at how Mitch and Trey deal with it after their work day is over, and the cameras stop rolling. I'll admit, this happened a few times in the film, but it should've been more. The director really missed out on a funny movie here, by not portraying it the right way, and not taking it in the right direction.We find the plot in this film, to not really be taken seriously at all. No one really cares. At one point, Mitch and Trey get a big lead, and the camera doesn't show them react at all to it. They just go off, and we see them joking around driving in the car again.The acting in Showtime was good, but the chemistry between the characters wasn't all that special. Nothing jumped out at me with DeNiro and Murphy. I've seen much better chemistry between actors. It wasn't horrible chemistry, but it wasn't great, either.All in all, what Showtime could've been, it isn't. It more or less forgets the cameras are following these cops, and just leads us away from caring about anything going on. Showtime is like a mix between Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills cop, COPS, and Turner and Hootch. It may sound like a weird combo, but it's true. Some of those films/shows are great, but if you combined them the wrong way, with wrong directing style and progression, what would you get? Showtime.So, do I recommend this film to you? Believe it or not, yes, I do. Because though it wasn't great, and wasn't half of what it could've been, it's still got some funny moments, and Robert DeNiro gives us the &#145;ol tough guy cop image like some of his other films, and Eddie Murphy redoes his `Break all the rules/procedures, goof off and triumph!' attitude. So though Showtime isn't great, a one time viewing isn't going to hurt. DeNiro's expressions throughout the movie help a lot. That's why I recommend renting and viewing the film once. 3/5 stars, enjoy!

Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. Not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted.The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. When I was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board I had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but I can't think of one who thought that this was just something I do until I get my career going in an area far afield. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job?Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does the showboating Murphy do, he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action. So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around.Eddie Murphy's a funny guy, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has. I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film.

This interesting angle on a familiar genre is lamentably under used, descending into a cameo by William Shatner full of poor jokes about T.J. HOOKER.

Eddie Murphy continues to be the most annoying man on film. Rene Russo gives it her best shot but is let down by weak characterisation and a lack of anything to do.The film takes over half its running time just to get the two cops set up, leaving them very little time in the latter half. To keep the running time down the investigation is made absurdly easy. The baddie is utterly generic, as is the McGuffin and the stakes are non-existent. The screenplay must take a lot of the criticism for this, being poorly paced, characterised and unfunny. A good car chase and a single good stunt involving a flood in a penthouse apartment fail to redeem the film. A poor effort.

They were great in just one scene, the frank conversation in the car, now I think that this scene was totally something of their improvisation! Another point, (De Niro) was 59 and (Murphy) was 41. True that the 20 years difference worked well but I think that Murphy's character as young actor who wants desperately to be a star is just younger than him.

De Niro isn't a terrible comedian; he is just such a great dramatic actor that his comic ambitions seem pointless.  It is like Michael Jordan trying to play baseball.This script is a weak satire of reality cop shows and buddy cop flicks.  It is no coincidence that the director of this film is Tom Dey, whose only other directorial effort was `Shanghai Noon', a Jackie Chan vehicle where Jackie does a comic duet with Owen Wilson in a lampoon of westerns.  The hope was that Dey would be able to weave the same kind of satirical magic here, but this film comes up way short.  To his credit, he did manage to give the film some good action footage.   De Niro tries to play the straight man in an absurd situation and it seems like his is the only character that realizes the lunacy of it.  Everyone else seems to take their absurdity seriously.  The tongue in cheek comedy is way over the top.  Rene Russo, William Shattner and Eddie Murphy overact so terribly that it is more sad than funny.

I do believe this is my problem with modern cinema, or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation. Isn't it odd &#150; people just don't laugh as much anymore, and I do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film Showtime. There was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all of the bantering between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo as eye candy, with even standard clichés which make the general population swoon with pre-programmed laughter, there was nothing in this film that made me laugh. There weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film. From the beginning, I didn't buy the match-up of De Niro and Murphy as anything more than Hollywood excitement, throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot &#150; where was it in the film? This falls to either two problems &#150; the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film. Either way, they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare Showtime.Outside of finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film. There was a glimpse of humor with De Niro's desire to pick up pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine so audiences would understand &#150; WHO DOES THAT?), but that was dropped and never developed. There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside of that one opening monologue, nobody would have understood that. He rents a room in a producer's house in which he can afford on a police officer's salary? This just didn't compute even for Hollywood standards. There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed, nor was there any true test of the weapons capability &#133; even at the end. It became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns. Where was the television show in this? Russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning, but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble. Random characters were introduced, forgotten, re-introduced, and forgotten all over again. The director and producer laughed at this, while we, the meager viewer, must suffer through inside jokes and cliché stereotypes.Was there a love interest in this film? Was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen? Were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this film? If you need the answers to these, obviously, you won't find them in Showtime. The fact that I am riddling this review with question upon question, only means that this sub-par (actually, well below sub-sub-sub par) filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world. Sure, it had big names and one really neat explosion, but there was nothing of substance to this at all. It was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichés, but not regular clichés &#150; go with the bad ones. The plot had no linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were drab and underdeveloped. This ranks below even the best of buddy-cop films. I like to give films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this film. Not even Shatner could save this film, and he even tried hard.Overall, I cannot, nor will I, suggest this film to anyone with a pulse. The commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrid jokes, and creators questioning the validity of their work. If creators can't stand behind Showtime, why should we? I didn't want a Lethal Weapon when I watched this, but I did want something like that. I understand there was some form of criticism of reality television and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message didn't make it off the page. In fact, I believe I saw media leave the theater first when I watched this. Shame carries its heavy hand with this film and I cannot blame it. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see Coming to America), but lately he seems to have lost his edge. De Niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further. One of these films is equal to one Scorsese picture.Skip this one. I promise, it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile.

Seeing the public reaction to this bad cop image, TV producer Chase Renzi makes a deal to drop the civil case against the precinct in exchange for Preston being the focus of a new cop reality show. The search for a partner draws the attention of actor-wannabe Officer Trey Sellars; Preston dislike and contempt for Sellars makes him the first choice to be his partner and the two find themselves lumbered together in the show. However, this is reality television and very soon the reality of a criminal with a powerful and deadly new weapon at his disposable raises the stakes beyond what even the network could have hoped for.When I went to hire a video to watch for a night in, I was in a rush but was told at the counter that I could get one more out under their deal and actually save a pound &#150; so I just grabbed the nearest film with no intention of watching it. That film was Showtime and funnily enough it was the film out of the selection that I ended up watching. 'Why?' you might ask 'did you watch the only one you didn't pick?'. Well, it was a lazy and chilling Friday night in and Showtime pretty much delivers just what I needed by being quite fun but never once causing you to think or really engage your brain by being original or clever. The plot is basically the standard mismatched buddy stuff and the actual crime story is merely the set up and something that allows the story to have an ending to speak of. As a buddy cop movie it does nothing new at all but still manages to be fun even if it doesn't really have anything approaching big consistent laughs. Many viewers will be annoyed, considering what a high profile movie it is, that it just trundles along the tired old clichés and jokes but others will find it forgettable and basic fun &#150; I supposed it depends on your mood and you expectations.The cast is maybe part of the reason expectations would be high since both have had some success with the mismatched buddy genre before (Midnight Run and, to a lesser extent, Beverly Hills Cop). De Niro is always watchable but he is very much on autopilot here, plying his usual moody self without ever giving an indication that he was doing more than taking money and aiming for an easy popular hit. Murphy also wheels out his usual shtick with sub-BHC banter and 'that' laugh. Together they manage to have just enough energy and natural screen presence to make a mark despite the tired material but really they have both been much better elsewhere. Russo has nothing to do and is really just a distraction in a role that could have been better served with a less well-known actress in it. The cameos are mixed and this is best demonstrated by the presence of Mos Def and Wiliam Shatner. Mos Def offered me hope because he is so often the best thing in average films; sadly here he was boring and I was surprised he had taken such an uninteresting role. Shatner however is much better and steals the film from the other stars in his scenes as he wonderfully sends himself and TJ Hooker up.Overall this is far from being a great film, despite the budget and big name actors involved. It is unoriginal, lazy and rather uninspiring, however this is not to say that it is not some degree of simple fun to watch &#150; if the genre weren't then they would have stopped kicking them out some time ago. If you approach it in the mindset of looking for basic entertainment with no real expectations on it then you should enjoy it, however if you think that it will rise above the pack solely on the basis of being a high profile film then think again and approach with caution.

And even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take you long to pick up on what you're in for-- specifically, a good time and plenty of laughs-- from this clever satire of `Reality TV' shows and `Buddy Cop' movies, `Showtime,' directed by Tom Dey, starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy.	Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a detective with the L.A.P.D., and he's good at what he does; but working a case one night, things suddenly go south when another cop, Trey Sellars (Murphy), inadvertently intervenes, a television news crew shows up and Mitch loses his cool, which results in a lawsuit by the television station that's going to cost the department some big bucks.  Except that they may be able to get around it, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch-- enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a `Reality' cop show, that would feature none other than Mitch Preston, whom Chase sees as a real life `Dirty Harry.'	Her boss likes the idea and gives Chase the green light.  Now all she has to do is convince Mitch to participate, which shouldn't be too hard, since the station has agreed to drop the lawsuit if he will do the show.  But Mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he wants nothing to do with any of it-- that is until he has a heart-to-heart with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who puts Mitch's future into succinct perspective for him.  And just like that, the show is on.  Oh, yes, there's one more thing; for the show, Mitch is going to need a partner.  And who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that?  Let's put it this way  Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects.	This is Dey's second film as a director, his first being `Shanghai Noon,'-- also a comedy-- and he's definitely showing a penchant for the genre.  From the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right along, and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing.  With stars like De Niro and Murphy, Dey, of course, had a leg up on this project to begin with, but he's the one who keeps it on track, demonstrating that he knows what works, achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action, and employing the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect. 	There isn't a more natural actor in the business than De Niro, and he steps into Mitch's skin like he was born to it.  And after years of doing hard-edge, cutting drama (in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another), with such films as `Analyze This,' `Meet the Parents' and now this one, he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy, as well.  Mitch is not an especially complex character; he is, in fact, something of an `ordinary' guy, but therein lies the challenge for the actor-- to make him believable, to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community.  And on all counts, De Niro succeeds.  He's Mitch, the guy you run into at the grocery store or the bank, or say `good morning' to on your way to work; who likes to watch the game on TV and has a life, just like you and me, who happens to make his living by being a cop.  It's the character Mitch has to be to make this film work, because it makes the `ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances' angle credible.  It's one of those role-- and work-- that is often wrongly dismissed out-of-hand, because it looks so easy; and, of course, this is what makes De Niro so exceptional-- he does make it look easy, and he does it with facility.	As Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy turns in a winning performance, as well, and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove.  Trey is a cop, but also an aspiring actor-- and a bad one-- and it gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the over-exuberant side of his personality (reigned in enough by Dey, however, to keep him from soaring over-the-top into Jim Carrey territory), which works perfectly for this character and this film.  From his melodramatic take on a part during an audition, to his throwing out of one-liners-- delivered by looking directly into the camera (which as far as he's concerned isn't even there) while filming the `reality' show-- Murphy's a riot.  And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, as this is another of De Niro's many talents; his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his co-stars, all of whom-- evidence will support-- are better at their craft after having worked with him, including the likes of Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, just to name a few).  Most importantly, this is a part that allows Murphy to excel at what he does best, and he certainly makes the most of it.	Russo makes the most of her role as Chase, too, a character who isn't much of a stretch artistically, but whom she presents delightfully, with a strong, believable performance.  And William Shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the show.	The supporting cast includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday (Camera Man).  Well crafted and delivered, `Showtime' is a comedy that's exactly what it is meant to be  Pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you chuckling for some time after.  It's the magic of the movies.  8/10.

The screenplay looked very promising, and I was looking forward to seeing Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy team up. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed with the end result.Robert De Niro plays Detective Mitch Preston, a no nonsense, humourless and gruff 28 year LAPD veteran who is partnered with Officer Trey Sellars played by Eddie Murphy who has life long aspirations to become an actor. Mitch Preston and Trey Sellars meet in unceremonious circumstances after Trey Sellars accidentally interferes in Mitch Preston's planned drug bust. Mitch Preston finds himself in further trouble when he angrily confronts a camera crew and shoots a camera. Mitch Preston is forced to appear on a police reality TV show called Showtime in exchange for the television network to drop the lawsuit against Mitch. Trey Sellars is recruited to appear on the reality show after he showcases his acting abilities and from there Mitch Preston and Trey Sellars are paired together by the show's producer Chase Renzi played by Rene Russo. While Trey Sellars drives Mitch Preston up the wall throughout the entire series, producers are strongly convinced the two make a great duo for entertainment purposes. Trey Sellars thrives in soaking up the limelight whereas Mitch Preston is very annoyed that the show is interfering with his life. Mitch and Trey must also track down the escaped drug dealers that evaded capture from Mitch at the start of the movie. William Shatner appears as himself as a technical adviser for the show.Robert De Niro finds himself out of place and going through the motions here in Showtime. While he has built his reputation on great movies such as The Godfather Part II (1974), Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990) and Heat (1995), he comes across cursing at himself like he has made a big mistake in appearing in this turkey. His character Mitch Preston is grumpy and not an interesting character in the slightest.Eddie Murphy in his prime is one of the funniest actors on screen. Look no further than 48 Hrs (1982), Trading Places (1983), Beverly Hills Cop (1984), and Coming to America (1988). Even his stand up shows Eddie Murphy Delirious (1983) and Eddie Murphy Raw (1987) showcase his best R-Rated foul mouthed humour that audiences knew and loved. Eddie Murphy has since found himself drawn to family friendly comedies which has been very hit and miss. In Showtime, Eddie Murphy tries too hard to be funny but fails miserably. His character Trey Sellars comes across as a slapstick buffoon who would not look out of place in they Keystone Kops silent comedy era.The rest of the cast I felt they couldn't save this movie at all, particularly Rene Russo who is normally a decent actress who could do no wrong. William Shatner spoofing his T.J. Hooker character was just one big unfunny joke.Showtime does little justice to the buddy cop comedy genre and the entire movie was just a fizzer.

It's not like it's one failed gag after the other, it's just that most of the time they don't even seem to be going for one. A lot of scenes in this movie seem very straight-forward with no comic intent whatsoever, so the thing looks more like a fluffy crime thriller than a hilarious comedy. With that said though it's still a really terrible fluffy crime thriller. Everything is horrendously clichéd, right down to the eccentric untouchable foreign villain. None of this stuff is new, everything has been done so many times before. The only difference here is that Robert de Niro is now on board, which somehow makes things even worse, especially since he has no chemistry whatsoever with Eddie Murphy. This was kind of a chore to watch really, don't know why I bothered since you know the ending just by reading the plot summary. Oh well, at least the William Shatner cameo was good.

Simply, this is a genuinely funny film. Whereas, Murphy's roles and acting has waned over the years, this is one he can hang his hat on. De Niro, how does he morph himself into an appropriate character in most films, similar yes, but different enough to make you forget about his last film.

My first viewing was a very unmemorable one, but it has now been two years since then, and I just decided to give it another try. My memory of the first viewing is fairly vague (proving how forgettable the movie is), and as it turns out, my second viewing wasn't much different, if at all.Mitch Preston has been a hardworking LAPD detective for twenty years. One night, while after a drug dealer, he finds himself in front of a TV camera, but does not wish to be, so in frustration, he shoots it! After this, the network plans to sue the department, unless Preston participates in a reality TV show about cops! The detective is forced by his boss to reluctantly do so, and it doesn't help when Officer Trey Sellars, who takes his job as a cop a lot less seriously than Preston does, and is just hungry for fame, becomes his partner on the show! These two are to track down a criminal with a highly destructive weapon, but working together will obviously be difficult for them! As a comedy, Showtime didn't do it for me. I smiled several times, but from what I remember, I only snickered once. Most of the gags are not terrible, but not really any good, so I can't think of any that are worth mentioning. As an action movie, it does occasionally have some good scenes of that type, but occasionally is the key word. It's only enough to add a BIT of suspense to the film, and not necessarily enough to make it worthwhile. Although this buddy cop spoof didn't really entertain me, it appears that it has entertained quite a few people, but if you plan to watch it, it's a good idea to keep in mind that it's basically fluff, nothing significant.

I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical buddy film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro going too.A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to act like cops. But, my favorite scene involves Murphy in the confessional hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop to team up with instead of De Niro. Man, that was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro...I think it brought out the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 of 10 stars.

The film starts interestingly but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing.It feels like especially De Niro doesn't enjoy being in Showtime. Thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie.

I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it. The comedic talents of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are tapped (fully - for this type of movie). Do not compare it to other movies with these star actors, simply enjoy it. The cast is great and, I believe, that the purpose of this movie was fully accomplished. If you want a really easy-going and very restful night - watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy simply had fun making this movie, so should we (watching it). And, please, do not be so negative. Do not expect Godfather performance or Meet The Parents from DeNiro, do not expect comedy blockbusters performance from Murphy... It is a completely different genre, and it made me relax after a hard day work. Your sides may not split from laughter, but it is still VERY funny.

I can see why it didn't fare well in that they were riffing off of what we expect of them but I noticed some new and unusual shadings to what they generally do. We expect these two performers to always be volatile but it seemed to me that they were consciously lowering the temperature and putting more wit into something that may not have deserved it. I'm thinking specifically of the stuff they did in the isolation/confessional booth. The spoofing of other cop shows and movies. The unspecific sexuality of both of the cops(Murphy's character supposedly dabbled in porn). There was a sense of the superhero quality to the action scenes that was funny and yet tough-edged. It could have been better and funnier but with Bad Boys, Jackie Chan/Chris Tucker, Owen Wilson and whoever out there, I admire what DeNiro and Murphy were trying to do. I definitely respect Tom Dey a helluva lot more than Michael Bey and his exploding and crushing of human beings comedies. The violence here was at a high pitch but he didn't linger on any gore. I feel that is a step up.

The idea reminded me a lot of the similar - and IMHO more superior - LAST ACTION HERO; in that we have an action film that pokes fun at the conventions of action films.I really love Robert de Niro in this. For a long time I was a bit sceptical of the gushing hype around him as a brilliant actor - best in the world, ever type thing. To me, the top actors can do everything from light escapist entertainment, to deep serious profound life- delving drama. It isn't the ones who just play artsy-fashionable grunge character roles that please the academics and serious film buffs, and hardly anyone else. But Bob in this role has finally proved to me he's truly an all-rounder. His prestigious critical reputation may be tarnishing a bit by doing more broadly entertaining type roles; but to me he's finally shown that he can do pretty much everything you throw at him - any faults are now usually the production or the script. He's got the range and experience to pull virtually any character off down pat.And Eddie Murphy does cement himself as a top professional comic actor. His role in this however. does seem to be a shade lighter riff of his role(s) in BOWFINGER. And I have to complain that the lighting and make-up in this film doesn't really compliment him that well. His extended African-style brow ridge comes up very prominently in a lot of scenes, which is a bit of a distraction. But, as stated on the DVD commentary, he does prove that he is the type of star who is funny, but when he holds a gun - it's serious.Storywise, the show is pure escapist fun. It does feel a little bit like a lot of standard Hollywood action scenarios and shots are just cobbled together, going through the same old formulaic motions. But in this particular case, that actually what makes it work. The story relies on the setups and climaxes being familiar - almost clichéd. The viewer needs to be orientated very quickly as to what is happening and WHY it is happening. Not much room for anything TOO fancy or unusual. Don't get me wrong - staying with the old scene clichés can get stale REAL fast. The industry constantly needs fresh blood and ideas all the time. But it needs to be in moderation, and for a tangible reason - not just show off the glitzy new concepts for the heck of it. A bit of old and a bit of new actually works best.I have to say the villain of the piece actually is very good, with the right balance of humor and menace. And the henchman played by T J Cross is very cool and fun - especially the prison interview scene, which really cooks.And finally, kudos to William Shatner for really providing the comic highlights of the story. The guy is a pure comic gem, and deserves all the applause he can get. I think he's earned it!

Had this movie been made a few years ago then it may have been a bit more original and 'in time' to be a part of the whole 'reality TV' boom. As it stands 'Showtime' is neither ironic nor exciting and you will forget it completely 5 minutes after watching it. If the movie were extended to a little over 2 hours, with tighter editing and a better script it may have worked. Nothing is fully explored or exploited in this film and the villain is so weak and pointless his role could easily have been played by a ghost.'Showtime' really ought to have been a mini-series. This would have offered a greater sense of self-referential, ironic humor and given more time to devote to plot, character, action and intelligence. But in this hour and a half movie, director Tom Dey cannot make anything work.Murphy isn't funny, DeNiro is sleepwalking and Russo is wasted. The only person contributing anything of worth is Shatner. And the references to his TJ Hooker show are ironic by accident in regards to Hooker being better than 'Showtime' and 'Showtime' within the movie. This movie is only an example of money thrown away and the totally wrong approach given to a promising concept. I would rent it. But make sure it is the widescreen version as the fullscreen (actually pan and scan, or 'CROPPED') has about %50 of the picture missing.The commentary is uninteresting and I must seriously point out that the advertised 'Uproarious additional scenes, including hilarious improvised Eddie Murphy' are anything but. Even if I had watched my own autopsy they probably still would be the most uncomfortable and unfunny things I have ever witnessed in my life.

The whole concept of getting the cop on TV and getting the two characters together seem too ill conceived.  The side plot involving the bad guys are so thin and lame that it seems to be tacked on afterward, but it probably isn't because that is when all the big actions happens.The pacing also seems odd, the film tries to be a quirky comedy at times, but the scenes just isn't that odd or hard hitting enough.

Basically, there is no chemistry between the two, and what little bonding that occurs in the Corvette seem to be forced onto us by the movie.

Don't see this.I've seen reviews of this film calling it over-acted, seemingly unscripted, unoriginal, and bland sitcom fare. Reviews here have called DeNiro unfunny. If you count any of those words towards this film in a negative connotation, you've obviously missed the point (or you're under 25). Yes, it is all those words, and that's what makes it funny. Not fresh, just funny.This film is the answer to all those unoriginal buddy cop tv shows & films of the 70's, 80's and the seemingly unscripted reality show drivel of today. It is over-acted from the first scenes as it's meant to. The characters are all exaggerations. Exaggerations of those with no sense of humor or fun (probably those writing film reviews for newspapers). Exaggerations of virtually every young Hollywood hotshot with power and hot new ideas. Exaggerations of how people with instant fame behave -- be it fame from a talent show or reality series or one-hit wonder in the recording studio, you know you've seen the types.DeNiro is an exceptional straightman to Murphy's jabbing at his own super-cop films. Russo, as the slimy Hollywood yes-woman is brilliant in her attempt to rise to the top at any cost. Add to that Bill Shatner giving acting tips (an uproar in itself) as his own TJ Hooker self; Pedro Damian as, what else, a bad guy; and cameos from familiar faces like Johnny Cochran, Ken Campbell, and Kadeem Hardison (who really should have had more scenes) and you have the ultimate in parody.Of course, the contradictory approach also adds to the hilarity DeNiro telling school children that it's not like you see on TV with big gun scenes and explosions and the very next scene an über-weapon destroys a warehouse of TVs. Renee Russo (blacklisted for setting baby items on fire as part of an expose and calling it good television) hopes to catch DeNiro going psycho AFTER he shoots a camera.It's not filled with intelligent humor or fantastic action and it's not destined to be a classic, but it certainly pokes fun at American media culture. Anyone that says DeNiro isn't funny should go back and look at the expression on his face when he gasps like it's his last breath and says, It's Showtime!The only disappointment was finding out that the final action scene cameos were cut from the released version.

But Mitch doesn't want to do the show and dispises Trey (isn't that half the fun?) due to his lack of seriousness on the job. De Niro and Murphy have a blast together as they turn a real police case into TV's newest flavour of the week with hilarious results. Murphy has not been this fun to watch since Beverly Hills Cop and De Niro puts in another masterfully crafted comedic performance. One could be tempted to pick the film apart and talk about how it could be a satire about how police work is portrayed on TV and is not like that in real life and although the film has some very smart lines, why bother when you are having this much fun.

Showtime is by no means a spoof.A spoof is meant to deliver alot of laughs, and they should be clever too...Showtime provides you with stale laughs, and an extremelly poor plot, but it's a Spoof isnt it? Then the plot don't matter..Right?? WRONG!!! Showtime is no Spoof, has no plot. Though i would say there was a waste of talent here, and Eddie Murphy was making me pretty much sick, he is so over.Robert Deniro barely did a good job either, i liked him in MEET THE PARENTS but how could he accept such a poor script? A script that had absolutely no support? I mean honestly around 25% of the film has a few chuckles in there, the other 75% you would just be wandering what the hell this is all about! I personally dont reccomend you wastch this, the film is short, stale and terribly plotless.ACTING The acting was nothing more than annoying, Roberty Deniro would always have that same facial expression, note that him ageing hasn't helped his acting either. As for Eddie Murphy he stole most Chuckles, yet i found his presence very annoying too, i mean where has he been all this time?ACTORS Good talent is used in the film, even though they dont tend to take advantage of that. The cast is good, nothing overly special, Eddie Murphy and Robert Deniro..And???? No-one else.SCRIPT The script was poor, who ever thought this was a parody? It was barely even a comedy, and the Action scenes were lame too, this film seemed quiet budgeted and bodged up, it was so poorly written too, they could have lengthened the script with more character development and some funny stuff, that we were MEANT to revieve.CINEMA Cinematography was poor, there was nothing to it. The whole film was set in a city/dock sort of setting and it wasn't pretty at all. I found the camera work to be absolutely normal, they could have done something different, but it was same old, same old.COMEDY The Comedy in Showtime is Thin. It is no Spoof, because spoofs are funny, enough said eh? I mean there are a few I Quote FEW funny scenes in the film, the rest of the film you aren't even smiling, its just that your brain is trying to realise what it is watching, a comedy or an action film? Bad chemistry i'd say.MUSIC/SOUND Again just plain boring and ordinary, theres not much i can say about this. There isn't alot of music in the film, sound was okay, not soundtrack worthy i would say.OVERALL Showtime was definantley dissapointing to watch, i don't know where these actors find the time to pull off, starring in such modern day rubbish, and for this film to call itself a Spoof is an insult to films like AIRPLANE!

It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his duties&#133;like, say, a T.V. cameraman. Mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of Chase Renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for her `reality T.V.' cop show.  She thinks that Mitch will give her the `edgy' boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself.  Enter Trey Sellars, a patrolman-cum-actor who's watched way too many Police Story re-runs. Of course Mitch and Trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues.We know that Mitch and Trey are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie. That's the way buddy-cop movies are suppose to work. In fact, it has to be said that Showtime rarely deviates from the time-honored clichés as writ by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There's a high tech McGuffin to get the ball rolling (in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks.)  There's a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin.  There are chases, shootouts and explosions. We all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it's all going to turn out. You know what?  There's nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know the well-worn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip, not the destination.  Showtime doesn't strain to be original.  Instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy.Robert De Niro is dryly funny as Mitch. In the past I've thought De Niro to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy. Lately, though, he's grown on me. He seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Trey. The best way to describe his performance is that Trey is what Murphy would be if Murphy weren't so talented and hadn't hit the big time.  Rene Russo has a droll time playing motor-mouthed show biz shark Chase Renzi. She stalks through the movie chasing high Nielson ratings with awe-inspiring determination.  In her zeal she re-vamps Mitch's life to make it more camera friendly. She even calls upon T. J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how be a more `authentic' cop. Shatner is funny, playing himself precisely as we expect him to be, loud, oblivious and slightly obnoxious.I have to admit I was really looking forward to Showtime and I wasn't disappointed.  Ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit. Today it's doing moderate business at best.  That's a pity because Showtime is a whole lot of fun.

There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all.  The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.  I supposed he was just a friend of Trey's, but I wanted to know more about him.  The other character that I liked was Mitch Preston's (Robert De Niro's) fellow cop/partner played by Nestor Serrano.

I think maybe I'm putting too much thought into a movie, I mean after all, it's a comedy...who cares about the characters?  I guess I do though.  I was really pleased to see this was directed by Tom Dey, who also directed Shanghai Noon.  Ever since I saw that movie I was looking forward to his next work.

For an actor of his caliber and his age, I wonder what it is that lures him to tripe like Showtime.Eddie Murphy is his usual self, and although he has his funny moments, I got the feeling that script and story-wise, he was not given that much to work with.Rounding out the cast are Rene Russo (as the pushy, sexy TV executive), Drena De Niro (playing her assistant) and William Shatner in a brilliant cameo as himself.

All he asks is that he be left alone to do his job.  Patrol Officer Trey Sellars (EDDIE MURPHY) is a different story. Instead of being a cop, he would much rather play one on TV. A frustrated actor, he spends his workdays rousting pickpockets and his evenings perfecting his action poses in front of a mirror.One night Trey stumbles into an undercover  operation in progress, blowing Mitch's chance of nailing a drug dealer. At the same time, a television news crew barges in. Frustrated at seeing months of work go down the drain, Mitch fires a shot at the camera. His impulsive action lands his photo on the front page of every newspaper the next day. Knowing a sure ratings draw when she sees one, network television producer Chase Renzi (RENE RUSSO), swoops in and sells the Chief of Police on the PR benefits of letting her crew follow Mitch around the clock for a live reality show about cops. To compensate for Mitch's gruff manner and total lack of acting talent, Renzi finds a charming, talkative, camera-ready partner someone more like Trey. For Mitch, it's a living hell. For Trey, it's his dream come true.It's Showtime.Like most cop movies, there was a Central American drug lord, a killer bar room brawl, and a spectacular  big finish where the bad guy gets it.

After all, I saw Meet the Parents so I knew going in that DeNiro was capable of good comedy, (Did you milk my cat you sick son of a b****?).  Not to mention that Eddie Murphy has made me laugh more times than I can count. But it was something about the blend of  DeNiro's straight man with Murphy's hammy overacting (mentored by Bill Shatner himself) that made this movie the funniest I've seen this year. The movie was not without its flaws. The plot was so transparent it needed Windex.

This leads to entire movies being used as references to other movies.  If it works for one line, or even a whole scene, it should work for the whole movie, right?  No way.Scream was a good movie that ended up being successful.  Sequels ensued.

The concept is simple and I'm not going to bother getting into plot summaries when there's a whole other section for that.  I'm sure you know what it's about.  It sounds like a very funny idea.  And, indeed, the previews made it look like a hilarious and fun movie.  But here's the problem; in order to successfully poke fun at buddy action cop movies, you have to give the audience something other than mind numbing dialogue and stupid action sequences.  The parts that are supposed to be real, and not manufactured by this television show, need to be different from the rest of the movie.I'm really tired of movies that are constantly saying that there's a message behind it, or there's a concept that they're going for, but they never come close to delivering.  It's like the commercials for psychic hotlines where they have the person saying, It works! It really really works!  Meanwhile the small print at the bottom of your screen says NO IT DOESN'T.

It's always interesting to see a serious actor paired up with a comic actor.  DeNiro and Murphy make an unlikely team, and it does create a lot of fish-out-of-water humor, but nothing we haven't seen before in the previous thousand-or-so buddy cop flicks.  The two talented actors give it their all, and I can't blame the film's mediocrity on them...but I can blame the scriptwriters.  First of all, reality TV has become such a staple of pop culture that it's no longer fascinating.  I liked the Truman Show, I laughed out loud at Ed TV, (both of those films were ahead of their time) but Showtime was released about six months too late.  I've never been a fan of reality TV in the first place, but after seeing rats devoured on Survivor and bull testicles devoured on Fear Factor, a reality show about two real-life cops on the beat doesn't sound that innovative.  One thing that kind of bothered me was I felt too much sympathy for DeNiro's character, a no-nonsense cop who's brilliant at his job and simply doesn't want to be bothered by swarms of cameramen following him after he successfully finished a drug bust.  So when the network executives approached him with the idea of this new reality show, I wasn't thinking Come on, Bobby.  Loosen up!  I was thinking Leave the guy alone.  He's just trying to do his job.  Of course, predictably, Murphy--the more dim-witted cop--ends up using his so-called street smarts and offers more help in solving the case than the overzealous DeNiro, but this is a simply a plot device.  However, I felt the climax was quite original and much more exciting than the standard shootings and car chases throughout the film. There are a few funny moments, but none that made me laugh.  I got a fair share of chuckles, though.  I wish Shatner could've gotten more screen time.  He was a hoot in Miss Congeniality and I was hoping to see another fine comic performance.  But he only has a forgettable, three-minute appearance in which he spoofs himself as a former TV cop.  All his funny gags--like Shatner sliding off the hood of the police car and falling to the ground--were given away in the previews.  And I can pretty much say that about most of the funny gags--if you've seen the previews, you've seen it all!  The film opens with about a three-minute sequence in which DeNiro preaches his thoughts on crime and punishment, and then we're supposed to laugh when they cut to the class of first-graders.  It was a great setup, but we already know the punchline!This is not an annoying, obnoxious or gross-out comedy and it is good-natured.  Aside from a good deal of PG-13 curse words, families should feel safe to take their kids to see this movie.  But the writing is dull and half-a**ed.  It seems like the script was written in an hour, without even the consideration of a rewrite.  The gags are basically sitcom material, and this movie would've been better suited for the small screen.  One thing I have to applaud though is the Johnny Cochrane cameo.  I think that was the only scene where I actually laughed.  You're better off waiting 'til Showtime hits the video shelves.

Take for instance some of the best films you have ever seen. Were they even more memorable because of their unexpected result? This is a situation that can be encountered upon the film &#145;Showtime'. Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy collaborate in a surprisingly fun action comedy that will no doubt surpass expectations.     Upon viewing the promos for this film, I was somewhat shocked that my favourite thespian was reducing himself to on-screen comic junk with Eddie Murphy. And as the end credits rolled, I easily came to forgive Robert De Niro for his role in &#145;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'.     Tom Dey directs this awfully funny buddy-cop film that contains some surprisingly heavy action sequences. Now before everyone thinks that I am praising the film out of personal bias because of Robert De Niro, they are mistaken. I desecrated &#145;The Bullwinkle' film and was prepared to do the same for this film. Yet &#145;Showtime' entertains in a matinee-like fashion that we have not seen for a while. True, it is not fresh for our main characters to portray police officers on film. They both have had their fair share of cop roles. De Niro has &#145;Flawless', '15 Minutes' and &#145;Copland' while Murphy has &#145;Metro', '48 Hours' and &#145;Beverly Hills Cop', and while these actors retain the same elements that compose their typical characters, Director Tom Dey somehow manages to extract a vivid and fresh take on the tired concept of the buddy-cop formula.      This film has its' flaws, there is no doubt about it. There are some heavy plot holes as well as a formulaic concept. Yet, for what it is worth, these inconsistencies do not mean much when as a viewer, you are laughing and simply enjoying the film for what it wants to be &#150; mindless fun.     Robert De Niro plays Mitch Preston, an ultra-serious Detective who is extremely camera shy. Rene Russo plays a television producer who wants to create a reality based cop show and has Preston in mind for the lead. In order to make the series more appealing, she casts Preston's exact opposite. Here enters Murphy who steals this film (as much as I hate to say it) as he acts in all his other films.  He plays Trey Sellers, a cop who has aspirations of becoming a professional actor. As they are brought together for the series, they no doubt but heads. But have you forgotten? It is a formulaic script, therefore while our two antagonists pursue the conventional foreign villain with the thick English accent, they bond, come to care for one another and even save each other's lives when given the chance. All this while escaping colossal gunfire and wreaking havoc in their fair city.      Director Tom Dey (Shangai Noon) directs his second film and surprises many with this quirky and easy comedy. He establishes his characters quickly and inserts much predictable tension between our two characters. Furthermore, the action scenes while not at all the most intense and carefully choreographed are still quite effective and capture the needed tenacity to demonstrate the evilness of the under-developed villain.      In a nutshell, this film is not about good vs. evil, it centers itself around upon the character clash between these two characters and their repeated attempts at getting on each other's nerves. And while they are on the chase for this barely noticeable villain, one remembers the formulaic format that somehow seems to work in this film.  The discerning viewer can see the low bridges, the double-crosses and the romantic relationships that are just up ahead.       The film's highlights will no doubt be the scenes of mindless banter between De Niro and Murphy and their interplay. The most noticeable trait within the film; in my opinion, is the manner in which Director Dey lets these two screen legends perform. As aforementioned, De Niro and Murphy's roles are by no means a stretch.    And in this film it works because De Niro is typical De Niro. The hands crossed, frown gesturing, subtle, menacing character he always is. Meanwhile, Murphy is always the loud mouth, hyper-filled character he always is. And the script calls for scenes between these two characters that just play off each other. It seems as if Dey simply mounts the camera and lets the noticeable improvisation begin. And somehow it all works.        Now that one knows how the film works, this reviewer will not dissect the film in its; most cinematic variables. Nor will I go at length at discussing the strengths and needed improvements within the film.

An excess of FX kept it from greatness, though","Date":"16 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Showtime falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As real life crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone. 9/11 sensibilities aside, for myself, all that pyro-techno hyper-effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years. It seemed a lame substitute for characterization, story, and engaging emotions. I hope the lesser quantity of it in Showtime is an indicator of a trend in Hollywood. A trend downwards, of less use of the silly, less use of the exploding building.Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Their screen presence and charisma-- and even their character depth-- have been a joy to behold for many years. That can't be dismissed here--- they are engaging actors, and entertaining and appealing in this movie. I can't put my finger on it, but perhaps the explosions, the excessive FX, and all of that diminished the final product??? Perhaps, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn't achieve its highest potential. Whatever it was, Showtime was entertaining-- I probably will buy the DVD when it comes out-- but I had the vibe that it nonetheless wasn't all it could have been. At least not all I had hoped for.Very good movie, but not a great movie. I gave it an 8 out of 10. "},{"Title":"Lights. Camera.

"},{"Title":"Disappointing","Date":"15 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Bubbling just beneath the surface of Showtime is a good idea.  Actually, it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime.  This film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too; it has the whole bakery.Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash, cop-slash-actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy).  When Preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman, and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo).  In the first of many errors and oddities in the movie, that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film.De Niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how TV cops don't act like real cops.  Funny thing is, as the movie progresses, his character and Murphy's begin to act more and more like the clichés they supposedly clash so strongly with.  In a smarter movie, De Niro's diatribe could have played as ironic comment; here, it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is.  While a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny, the team of writers and director Tom Dey (Who made the far superior Shanghai Noon a few years ago; see that movie instead) seem to be on unsure footing, and instead of slamming the TV industry, they really let them off light (The harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work).  Russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress' enthusiasm.  With little on screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes.  For instance; if Showtime (the name given to the cop show) is such a popular smash, why doesn't anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are on the job?  For that matter, if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy Vargas is being televised, why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail?  Then again, given this villain's actions maybe I shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing a deal, and then dispatches him how?  By using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house, of course!  That's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. Occasionally, Showtime gets laughs, but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time.  Even worse, the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something, if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script.  Murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and De Niro looks flat out bored through most of this.  After a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (That remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests) Russo's character shouts `That's great television!'  Perhaps it's great television, but it's far from a great movie.

Great expectationa often lead to dissapointment, and this proves to be the case.When Eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal being done by Detective Robert, they botch it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality TV cop show. Logic is not a great component of this movie. The super-gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down confirms it. A twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheetmetal and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is as more a fantasy than science fiction. A five pound gun, firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil, is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past.It is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children, so if you are somewhere in between, this is the movie for you.

For a guy primarily known for serious roles, De Niro is a heckuva comic actor.  Of course, it helps to have his past film images to play against.  Consider that one of those roles, 15 MINUTES, was a cop having to deal with the interference of the mass media, and you have an interesting set of compare/contrast performances.Murphy plays another of his Axel Foley sort of characters.  Shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world self who was best known for TJ HOOKER and not STAR TREK.It's interesting to watch how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in TV and film.  Shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding across a car hood; De Niro points out holsters scratch the hood finish.  Ironically, as the film progresses, De Niro's character begins to incorporate the illusions of TV-cop reality into the real world case he's working.The film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources, so one could make the comment it is derivative.  Well, so what?  Satire needs to derive its humor in order to exist.  And besides, the film does have quirky moments of originality.  For example, I'm reasonably sure the method of the villain's death has never been done before.   One quibble about the reality of the weapons involved--  shouldn't those guns have had some kind of recoil?  In order to penetrate steel, those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate.  And any bullet's highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing.  So....  firing a volley of these tank-killer bullets should have driven the shooters back onto their butts. Oh, what the heck...  it's a satire.  Maybe the guns' lack of recoil is itself a satire on the B-F-Guns used so casually in thrillers.

From there, hilarity ensues.Unlike other buddy cop movies, this movie doesn't play the race card. As a matter of fact, I don't remember one joke or race comment. It is a different kind of humor.There is a small but strong bond that the audience should be able to form with the characters. You find out that Preston has an ex-wife. You find out that Sellers had a uncle he looked to for inspiration, even if it was just because he wanted a speech. (See the movie to find out)As the movie goes on, the two start to bond and have an effect on each other. Preston will teach Sellers how to be a detective. Sellers will teach Preston to be a star.All in all this movie was exactly what it was supposed to be. Funny, quick and light. The ending was a little anti-climactic.
