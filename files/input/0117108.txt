Though its situation of a man cloning himself in order to make his life more manageable would have been an interesting one to play with a serio-comic focus, Multiplicity  - despite some token moralizing - is pretty much content to play its premise for wacky farce. As such, however, it does an expert job the timing in the scenes is impeccable and the interplay between the main characters is sharp and memorable. This is especially amazing since the main characters here are almost exclusively played by Michael Keaton. His ability to not only delineate between the four versions of himself, but also to play each of these selves off convincingly against the others is nothing short of superb. In my mind, this represents a much more awesome achievement than does Eddie Murphy's similar multiple role-playing in The Nutty Professor - and here it's not just pointless showboating (there was no reason besides vanity that Murphy had to play every member of his family), but absolutely intrinsic to the movie's success. Essentially, the film rides on Keaton's ability to do precisely what he does as well as he does. Multiplicity represents his funniest film work in years, and perhaps his best ever.A couple of scenes in particular stand out as howlingly funny set pieces - such as the one in the restaurant and the one where the clones are left alone with Keaton's wife, played by Andie McDowell. It's a shame her character wasn't at least a little bit more sketched in by the writers (compare this, for example, to her wonderfully three dimensional role in Groundhog Day) - it might have made the film a little fuller. In fact, none of the supporting characters are really given much to do here, making it solidly a one man show. But what a show! With Keaton truly hitting every comic grace note available, you don't really have much time to notice or care about the lack of secondary characters. I have seen this film four times and it has yet to lose one iota of its hilarity or charm. Hey, how much more can you demand from a comedy?

Of course Andie MacDowell was good as his wife, but Michael Keaton steals the show. It's hard to get bored over the course of the movie because you keep wanting to see what Michael Keatons various personalities are going to do next. The effeminate Doug alone makes the movie worth a watch. My main issue is probably with the editing. I'm sure it's hard to edit one guy being multiple guys (especially in 1996) but a few of the panning shots were kinda choppy. Not a huge deal, but it does take you out of the moment for a second. This movie is probably a 7 out of 10, but giving it an 8 to make up for the undeserved 5.7. I'm pretty picky about my comedies, but this one raised itself above the pack.

And it is really amusing listening to the clones refer to Michale Keaton's Character as Doug (or 'Steve' in the case of #4) but are quite happy and comfortable in referring to each other by the numerical order in which they were created.One of the most hilarious parts of the movie is when rule number one is put to the test....watch it and you'll see what I mean.....and also how number 2 warns number 3 that Dougs wife is going upstairs.............Some people might think the character of 4 was a bit over the top, but if he had of been any less crazy than what he was..........it wouldnt have come off as well.  After all, when a copy of a copy of a human doesnt come out right......you have to wonder what sections have been muddled up....Brain cells, chromosomes, Dna etc.....when you think of that, number 4's character was fairly tame.A good movie that uses the talents of a good actor.8/10 "},{"Title":"reasonably funny","Date":"1 July 2008","Score":"13 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" I think this was a good film with a good concept and adequate execution.

Multiplicity is a romantic comedy, a fantasy, that lightly explores the source of a very common complaint among married people with children. If you have ever wished that you could be in two places at once, then you should enjoy watching this story of a man who actually gets his wish - and then some. We viewers have become a pampered and sophisticated lot, and I was pleasantly surprised that this film nodded its head in acknowledgment of this reality. The cloning technology in the film is no more believable than are wish granting fairy godmothers, but we all enjoy movies about ghosts, werewolves, monsters, and such, with out their having to be validated, so I tip my hat to director Harold Ramis for instead just dealing with the nuts and bolts of facing the clone, or oneself as it were. There is no super-serious or heavy message like that you would expect from something like the X Files. The treatment is light, and we are seated somewhere between a Michael Keaton special and family level comedy. Keaton is no less than superb, and his performance alone is worth the price of admission. The plot is very well contained and runs an appropriately narrow course allowing this master performer to explore not only his craft but also the old adage about  &#133; the best laid plans of mice and men &#133;.  The movie is seeded with straight-men(women) who appear as a matter of course as they do in any working day. They react in a believable way to the excruciating confusion that presents itself at almost every turn. The dialog is intelligent and the humor regularly sarcastic without being the least bit cynical. The lead straight-man in the film is Andie MacDowell, who plays her role as wife and mother with dignity, restraint, and is appropriately and intelligently challenged by what she faces as the plot unwinds. She remains loving and kind, while staying strong enough to allow Keaton to bounce off of her effectively without her being demeaned. There is something for all but the youngest viewers of this film and any love making that occurs is implied and anything approaching bawdy humor is short, quickly given, and quite tame.Keaton plays the lead male as well as the clones making this film more than a just simple romantic comedy; it is also a warm and charming gift of appreciation to the memory of the late Peter Sellers. Mister Keaton, my regards for a job well done, and thank you for continuing so well in the footsteps of your mentor.

One of the most ingenious comedies ever made, any film Ramis chose to make next would be a tough act to follow. With Multiplicity, Ramis has crafted a likable, slightly underrated feature, but one that still falls short of the inventive heights of Groundhog Day.Doug Kinney (Michael Keaton) is a stressed out construction worker. His workload is never ending, and he has to deal with office rivalries, incompetent co-workers and backlogged production schedules. All things that leave little time for his wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) and kids. Doug already feels there is not enough of him to go around, and he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown.But when he meets Dr Owen Leeds (Harris Yulin) of the Gemini Institute, he offers Doug a solution to his problems. Cloning. Two hours later, Doug 2 is born. This version is much more macho and work-inclined, so by day he goes to work, and at night he stays in Doug's guesthouse. Meanwhile, Doug can finally have some time to himself and spend time with the kids, while Laura can go back to work.But when Doug still doesn't have time for himself, he creates Doug 3. This one is in touch with his feminine side, which makes him perfectly suited to helping around the house. And eventually 2 and 3 create Doug 4, an imperfect clone that's little more than a vegetable. So when Doug decides to go away for the weekend, the clones are left in charge and chaos erupts.I've always thought Michael Keaton often seems like he has more than one person inside of him, which makes him ideally cast for Multiplicity. He puts in a tour-de-force performance, and the film is carried on his (many) shoulders. All of his different interpretations of Doug are funny, and the special effects are excellent. Any scene with Keaton conversing with himself is a hoot, making this one of his best performances.Ramis' direction is excellent too, and keeps things in perspective. There is a very natural flow to Multiplicity as the plot unfolds. For the first three quarters of an hour, the film is content to explore the dynamic between Doug and Doug 2. Quite realistically, 2 eventually wants more than just work, and starts going out on dates. This leads to one very side-splitting sequence when Dougs 1 and 2 are both in the same restaurant with Laura and their secretary.Then when 3 comes along, he is keen to share housekeeping trade secrets and cooking tips with Laura, who's getting more confused by the minute. And with the arrival of 4, Keaton gets to let out all the stops and puts in his zaniest performance since Beetlejuice. This all leads to one inspired moment when Laura has sex with all three clones in one night. Finally 3 loses Doug's job, Laura leaves, and chaos is about ready to reach critical mass.And that's when Multiplicity runs out of steam. It suddenly loses the focus that's been so tightly maintained, and unfortunately cops out with a very moralistic ending. Where Groundhog Day was endlessly inventive and constantly satisfying, Multiplicity peters out. Shame really because it was a lot of fun up until that point. In fact you can even see the mark where the film suddenly runs out of ideas and goes into sitcom mode.Still, one thing I did like about the ending was the three Dougs get to go out on their own and even set up their own restaurant. 2 brings in the customers, 3 handles the cooking, and 4 delivers the pizzas the same way he delivers newspapers.Although Multiplicity has a lot of good ideas and gags aplenty, it falls into the film category of a one-joke variety, and also falls into the same trap. They're funny up to a point. Nonetheless, it's far too likable to be easily dismissed, and there is plenty to enjoy. Like a masterful performance from Michael Keaton, great effects, and Harold Ramis again demonstrating that he may be the only director in the world who can actually get a good performance from Andie MacDowell.

How can you be in two places at once, and where do you get that extra pair of hands you need so desperately to stay afloat?  One man finds the answers in `Multiplicity,' a comedy from director Harold Ramis.  Doug Kinney (Michael Keaton) owns a construction company, but finds the demands of the job as well as the needs of his family (a wife and two kids) are just stretching him too thin.  On a job doing some additions to a laboratory one day, Doug begins to lose it; his temper flares and he's at his wit's end, all of which is noticed by a certain Dr. Leeds (Harris Yulin), a scientist, who offers him a solution to his problems.  It involves a project with which the lab has already had some success  cloning.  And once Doug is convinced it can be done safely, he goes for it, and to his astonishment, it works.  He ends up with a duplicate of himself; finally he will be able to get some time off.  Or so he thinks.  His clone quickly finds himself swamped with work, even with Doug's help (they manage to keep the identity of the clone a secret, of course), and decides that he, too, needs a clone.  But it doesn't stop there.  Before it's over, Doug finds himself with three clones; physically identical, but each with a distinctly individual personality.  The first is rugged, the Doug ready for any job, any time.  The second is more in touch with his feminine side; he is quite accomplished and likes to cook.  The third, however, turns out a bit `watered-down,' having lost some resolution, as it were, in the process.  He's a bit slow and just slightly off-center.  He loves pizza, for instance, and keeps a piece in his wallet `for later.'  Pretty soon Doug's wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell) begins to notice some changes in her husband's behavior.  Of course, she doesn't realize that she's dealing with one man and three clones.  All of which leads to trouble in paradise, and some quite humorous situations along the way. 	Cleverly handled by Ramis, this is a funny movie and a veritable showcase for the talented Keaton, who manages to create a unique personality for each of his characters.  The scenes in which the four of them are together, and Doug has to deal with `himselves,' are hilarious.  MacDowell does a good job with Laura, giving her enough vulnerability to enable the audience to empathize with her frustration at suddenly having to cope with a seemingly schizophrenic husband.  When she tries to have a serious conversation with the worst of the clones and asks him, `What do you want?' while attempting to sort out their recent differences, and the reply is `Pizza!' it makes you want to cringe, except that you're laughing too hard.  And there are a lot of laughs here. 	The supporting cast includes Eugene Levy, who adds some droll humor as Vic, a more than inadequate subcontractor who works for Doug; Richard Masur (Del), Ann Cusack (Noreen), John de Lancie (Ted), Judith Kahan (Franny) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Walt).  `Multiplicity' is a highly imaginative comedy that works, and is well presented.  One Michael Keaton in a movie like this is a treat; and here you get four for the price of one.  And that, my friends, no matter how you clone it, can't be a bad thing.         I rate this one 8/10.

But one clone turns into two clones turns into three clones&#x85; the complicity confusing his workmates, his wife (Andie MacDowell), and especially himself.Keaton displays his magnificent multifaceted elasticity by playing every clone with a distinct personality - and never lapses or loses conviction in the four different archetypes. Keaton's performances are so subtle, and work so well against each of himself, that we never notice how stunning his portrayals are; how much blood, sweat and CGI must have gone into learning his lines in a certain character and then playing off three other actors who would eventually be replaced by him - and playing off them four different times as four different types!It is a jaw-dropping performance. Clone Number 1 (whom Doug calls 2) is The Bruce Willis - the masculine side of Doug predominant; 3 is Doug's feminine side predominant; when 2 clones himself to make 4, it's a monkey boy, because you know how copies of a copy are not as good as the original... Don't bring analyticity &#x96; or it gets disturbing. So the movie never dwells on the cloning process or its moral implications. The only moral authority is Doug's Rule Number One No one sleeps with my wife except me! Of course, one rainy night when Doug 1 is away, that specificity is not simplicity when Doug's wife wants fluidity&#x85; Keaton is in every single scene, yet because he plays the four personalities so convincingly, when Doug 1 spends so much time offscreen trying to stay on eternal vacation we feel like we're watching three other guys playing Keaton playing Doug! We kick ourselves to remind us it's Keaton on screen IN PERPETUITY. The visual acuity - lighting and sightlines - is 95-percent on target, and as Doug's clones build in their multiplexity, Keaton's synchronicity with his multiplicity is ingenuity incongruity.Directed by Harold Ramis, MULTIPLICITY is bound to be good gratuity from the get-go. Keaton takes it into orbital superfluity.Ably supported by Andie McDowell and her strange accent, reliably confused in all the right places, as is the rest of the cast (Richard Masur, Eugene Levy, Ann Cusack), who feature minimally because Keaton is hogging all the screen time.Message comes through loud and clear - having more of yourself doesn't make life easier, but actually harder; multiplicity breeds instability. There are metaphors on top of metaphors Doug had to go outside of himself to see himself; in discontinuity, Doug learns continuity; in promiscuity, Doug learns monogamy; in ambiguity, I've lost myself in trying to rhyme everything&#x85; After 2 clones himself, the real Doug yells without irony, You can't just go around cloning people! Doubt anyone else could have pulled off these roles with as much electricity in their authenticity and eccentricity.After all, there's only one Michael Keaton! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

I've watched it twice now, and I can tell you that it's a very entertaining movie and is quirky, goofy and inane in it's portrayal of what would happen if a man were to clone himself. It's original in it's concept, the story being based on a short story by a man named Chris Miller. Michael Keaton is Doug Kinney, a Los Angeles construction worker who finds that home is just a place he goes to in between chaotic situations at work; one of his employees (Played by Eugene Levy) for example has just gone and dug up the wrong driveway in suburbia. His hectic situation has his stay-at-home wife Laura (Andie Macdowel) frustrated as she would like to get back to work, and not have to take care of their two young children all day. In a fit of rage one day, Doug, who is frustrated as he finds that his work comes first, then his family, and then time for himself tagging along in third place, attracts the attention of a scientist who believes that he may have a solution to Doug's problems; cloning. So Doug agrees to the procedure, and an exact copy of him is created. However, physically the clone is an exact copy, but their personalities will differ in certain ways, as this clone is more macho and hard working than Doug. So Doug lets his wife go back to work, while he fills in at home, and the clone works at the construction sites. However, it isn't long before Doug clones himself again, and a more camp, sensitive and domesticated version of him is produced. The clones are made live in the garage, and eventually, they clone themselves, producing a degenerate form of Doug (Something to do with clone genes being bad). It's predictable from here on in, but it's very entertaining as the clones and Doug attempt to elude Laura's suspicions that her Doug hasn't been the same man lately. The special effects are superb in this film as they allow Michael Keaton to portray three to four different characters on the screen at the one time. Keaton provides a brilliant performance, displaying a wide range of acting skills as he portrays completely different personalities of the same character. It's an interesting concept - this cloning thing - and while the screenplay could have had had the clones doing crazier things or getting into more trouble, increasing the possibility of detection, then this could have been a completely different movie. Whether it would have been better of not, I'm not sure, but as it is, Multiplicity is a fun movie that I really enjoyed more upon a second viewing and really made me laugh.

In his early film career, he started out at mid-range, even as an actor (though he was excellent in Ghostbusters). Before then Ramis depended on getting approval with his audience with slapstick comedies to please the Hollywood masses. Caddyshack sort of stood out above the rest, but it was still an overrated film considering the more fresher work he's done later in his career.Multiplicity stars Michael Keaton as a construction foreman named Doug Kinney who feels overloaded in his work with very little appreciation from the people surrounding him. Feeling like he's at the end of his rope, he conjures up a crazy solution. By irony, while he is supervising a facility that specializes in cloning techniques, he decides that this might actually work out the kinks of multi-tasking work and family life. Once the doctor gives him the green light to start cloning, a duplicate emerges. However, the clones were not as equal in intelligence as Doug had hoped for. So he kept making more duplicates of himself and now, Doug finds himself in a more deeper predicament than he was before. The comical notion emerges on how Doug is going to fix the messes he got himself.in. Within each clone, they eventually start to pick up on his mental characteristics and it in a way exhibits our ways of the trials and tribulations in dealing with work and family life and we realize that there will never be any shortcuts and that we must take everything one day at a time.Many reviews put this movie down because it mainly lacks in anything remotely logical. I have no reason to argue about that analogy at all. But you have to understand that this is just a comedy that doesn't have to be plausible in any way. But the overall concept of this comedy has a very deep effect about life itself and the subtle dramatic undertones does indeed garner much for the audience to think about when you're in a similar situation that Doug is facing in his life. However, Keaton's silly humor will likely keep you entertained at the same time. And this is where we see the improvements that Ramis has accomplished as a director and writer. He doesn't have to depend on having lazy jerks screwing with every woman they lay eyes on, or people doing disgusting bodily functions like farting and burping just get the viewers attention. And though there is very little in terms of content. Your kids won't have to worry about stuff like nudity or gratuitous course language. If there were changes made, it wouldn't be for the better. It might come come off as too goofy or too dramatic or maybe even a little bit of both. Sometimes things are left best just the way it is, and Multiplicity is one of those movies.

This one on a handful of occasions actually had me laughing out loud, so for that reason alone I have to say it's pretty solid. Michael Keaton is what makes this work so well. It's not just because he's the star - it's that he stars in four roles. It's not a costume comedy, though, which makes his performance all the better. He essentially plays the same character with tweaks and variations to differentiate between them, and he pulls it off brilliantly. Each character is a character of his own, and even the interactions between the characters he plays are pulled off flawlessly so that everything is very natural.The story is tailor made for a comedy revolving around mistaken identity. Keaton's basic character is Doug Kinney, an overworked contractor who's finding that he doesn't have time to keep everything in his life in balance. Hoping for a miracle to help keep his life together he finds himself doing some work for a geneticist who's discovered the secret of cloning humans. It's not scientific - the clones come out as exact physical replicas rather than as newborn babies with identical genetic material to the original - but this is a comedy, so who cares! It works! Starting with one clone (named, simply, 2) Doug finds that even one copy isn't enough, so he makes another (named, appropriately, 3.) 2 and 3 are completely different from Doug and polar opposites from each other. 2 is a macho, take charge type who happily takes over the contracting business but chafes about having to stay out of sight when he'd much rather be picking up women, while 3 is an effeminate, stay at home type who loves cooking and cleaning. Eventually, 2 and 3 find themselves over-burdened, and they create another clone (named - guess what - 4.) except that 4 is a copy of copy and so, therefore, imperfect, for lack of a better way to put it. Intended to make Doug's life easier, all these 3 clones do is introduce increasing chaos, and at times it is hilarious.Really the only other cast member of note is Andie MacDowell (who teams again with director Harold Ramis as she did in Groundhog Day) as Doug's increasingly confused wife Laura. Unfortunately, the movie revolves so completely around Doug and the clones that MacDowell, while she was good enough and as always quite lovely, seemed to fade into the background more often than not, so that her talents were generally underused. She's more impressive opposite Bill Murray in Groundhog Day than she is here, but that's more a result of the type of movie and the role that it asked of her rather than any deficiency in her performance.This is almost two hours long - which might be a little bit too much for this type of silly comedy. It gets to that length perhaps by trying to introduce too much drama (if you will) in the last while about Doug and Laura's faltering marriage. Still, it's a funny movie, and Keaton's performance is worth watching.

Running Time 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sexual content)By Blake FrenchMultiplicity is a comedy that details a very relevant subject matter. Also, it is quite a funny movie. It's just too bad the film eventually experiences self destruction with the engaging humor it offers. The picture is directed by Harold Ramis, better known as the ''Analyze This'' director, and Egon Spangler of Ghostbusters, who knows what he's dealing with here, and presents the material in a somewhat effective manor. However, it's only a matter of time before the script plummets into a black hole that is impossible to escape, no matter how many laughs available.The film details the life of an average married couple, Laura and Doug Kinney. They live in a small suburban household with their elementary aged children. Doug is a very, very busy person. He is an architect and his spouse  is a simple homemaker. Laura desperately wants to go back to work. But with Doug's exhausting work schedule that doesn't allow him much time with his family let alone with himself, it is improbable of her becoming employed any time soon.''My whole life is an emergency'' says Doug in a scene that is subjective with somewhat blunt subtext. We feel empathy for the Doug character at this point in the film, due to its good character development. Filling much of today's society are overheated schedules. Therefore, we are able to relate to Doug's turmoils here.Then Doug is offered a chance to turn his life around--a Miracle offered by a mysterious individual Doug meets at work. He has the chance to create time for himself--to be cloned. Doug is interested. When we assume the price is right, he takes this opportunity to his advantage. (I did question, however, if the cloning process is so effective and affordable, why doesn't everyone in the universe know about it.)It's a very cute premise; the filmmakers are on the break of some original material here. We realize the comic possibilities are endless with this plot. But instead of giving us new, inventive situations and hilarious events, the creators execute the story with the same joke repeatedly. We first see the internal problem is Doug's desire for time on his hands. Then realize it is not solved but made more complex with the cloning experiences. We'll get into the film's mess-up in a moment.Doug is cloned not once, not twice, but three times. Discovering that life is just as, if not more, complicated with his new secret helpers, whom Laura does not know about. We are treated to scene after scene of the same kind of humor, some of which is funny. The only tension involves our suspense of when Laura will discover the clones.  But that isn't looked into here. Instead the script is forced to keep on stretching its humor until it manages to come up with a new conflict.The problem begins being introduced with a specific rule that none of the clones are permitted to have sex with Laura. Then Doug goes away for a little while and chaos ensures. The Doug clones get the real Doug fired from his job, Laura leaves, and each of the clones manages to bed Laura.Instead of indulging us with fulfilling our interests, like lettingLaura to discover the clones and react humorously, the movie changes content when Doug desperately tries to get his wife, and life, back. But to our surprise, the Andie McDonnell character is actually left out of the story here. She is mostly used as a plot device to acquire the movies many structural and character needs. Thus, we really don't care about Laura coming back with Doug.The problem with Multiplicity isn't that it's bad, but that is that it didn't have to be so bad.  It contains some really nice material, and Michael Keaton delivers a superb performance that is an actor's dream. It's just too bad with such an entertaining premise and so many witty scenes that the movie couldn't amount to more than it is here.Brought to you by Columbia Pictures.

I have no issues with the idea of cloning technology. However, after this point is where I have huge issues with the story. First of all, this doctor offers to make clones of him so he can get more time. Was this technology not patented? If so, everyone would know about it and it would not be something new. If not, why would it not be patented? And even if it was not patented, how did they hide this technology from the government??? Governments would be immensely interested in this technology (let's clone the perfect warriors). Governments would be very interested in keeping the technology from getting out as well probably.Apparently this new super technology is cheap enough for some middle class smuck to afford? New technology is usually when it is the MOST expensive, not inexpensive.

As a comedy, it has funny parts but not enough, it never really takes full advantage of it's fun and unique story, it could have used Doug's struggles with work and family to a larger comedic affect, there also could have been more clones, he only has three, despite the poster suggesting that the plot goes way out of hand, and that's the biggest problem, it never does. The film is far too predictable, once the clones arrive you can predict all the problems that await Doug from a mile away, there's is never any real sort of twist or unexpected moment that turns the entire plot on its head, it's simply too safe, and because of that we are left with a Michael Keaton starring, Harold Ramis directed, movie that lets you down.

Keaton had to shoot each scene 3-4 times with the parts of the previously filmed clones playing on monitors off screen to get the interaction right. Once he was done shooting one scene with one character,he changed and came back and shot the scene all over again as another clone with a totally different personality.

The three clones differ from the original Keaton quite a bit.

So Keaton is basically giving four performances here, so he has a lot of opportunity to show his acting chops. Unfortunately, by 1996, Keaton had pretty much hit rock-bottom, and he does little but mug throughout the movie. It doesn't help that the script flat-out sucks.

So when a scientist at a genetic engineering lab tells him about the cloning technology, he decides to snap it up. Soon he has a clone to do his job and the housework while he can go out and enjoy himself. Things are not that easy though because he is trying to keep his clones a secret and they simply want to live a normal life.I guess there are two ideas in this movie this first is responsibility and the second is the nature of the clone. In this movie we see the hero trying to escape his responsibilities by placing the burdens upon other people. We see the frustrations he has with other people at the beginning of the movie where he feels that he cannot assign tasks to anybody. He is constantly pushing them out of the way so that he may do the job himself. It doesn't help his problems at all though. When he has a clone doing his job, he finds that housekeeping takes over all of his free time, so he gets one to do his jobs there.The clones, interestingly enough, begin to develop their own personalities (which shows us Michael Keaton's acting ability), but the original is not interested in them leading their own lives. He created them for a specific job and that is the job that they must do. This raises the idea as to whether these clones are real people or property. The original treats them as property, but we notice that they want their own lives and want to do their own thing. They even clone themselves, which creates a less efficient one. Through all of this, the original is trying to hide them and stop them from enjoying themselves.When one thinks about them, it is not really possible to create clones to do one's work, as when the clone is created, it becomes a separate person and as such has its own memories, which it does not share with the original. Not only that, they are real people with real desires, and to prevent them from enjoying themselves is like preventing a real person from enjoying themselves, but then they are real people.In conclusion, this is an okay movie, which is slightly twisted, but generally dull. Not something I am going to rave about or even suggest watching more than once.

It sort of plays like a sequel to Mr. Mom, as Michael (or his clone) eventually ends up playing a Mr. Mom so his wife can return to work, this time, as a Realtor. Michael does a great job portraying 4 different personalities, including a macho-man, a metro-sexual, a goofy copy, and himself, Doug One. The funniest scene in the movie involves Laura's rampant sexuality, right after Doug warns all the clones not to sleep with my wife. Andie Mcdowell, as Laura, is quite good as his long-suffering wife, but she isn't Terri Garr, so she pretty much plays the straight-man to Doug and 3 clones. Many plot-holes, as it is quite unbelievable that absolutely no one would notice triplets living in the guest room over the garage. Great special effects. It looks real, not matted in. Like Mr. Mom, the film starts to lose its luster and drags towards the end, but wraps up smartly with Laura looking out the car window and, not believing her eyes, sees all 3 clones drive by on their road trip South. The cloning process looks about as real as any sci-fi techno-babel ever seen on Star Trek. I just saw this on This TV and have yet to see it uncut. It's a 117 minute film and they ran it in 120 minutes with many commercials. Besides speeding up the film, what did they cut out to fit the time slot?

He meets a doctor(Harris Yulin) who is experimenting in the science of cloning, who persuades Doug to have himself cloned so that he can have more time with his family. Doug #2 is all about work (or so Doug thinks)leaving Doug more time with his wife (Andie McDowell)and kids, but Doug gets spoiled and decides he needs even more time so he gets cloned again and Doug #3 is very domestic and is an expert in the kitchen, very Felix Unger-like to the point where he starts criticizing McDowell about her skills in the kitchen, but this does free up Doug more and allow McDowell the opportunity to return to work. However, Doug #2 and #3 start getting stressed out and, unbeknownst to Doug, create Doug #4 and the complications that ensue are predictable but the fun in this picture is watching the skill with which Keaton makes each Doug different from the previous one. Actually Doug #3, the domestic one, is my favorite and he is hysterically funny when Doug #2 gets sick and #3 has to go to work for him and is absolutely clueless about the work and gets Doug fired. Once Doug #4 (who being a copy of a copy, turns out to be kind of retarded)appears on the scene, the film begins to lose its momentum but it's a fun ride for most of the way, thanks to remarkable work by Michael Keaton.

He is shacked up in the garage where everything depends on his wife not finding out. Now she can return to work but once the demands become too much then Doug 3 is brought in. Doug 3's distinction is that he is overly sensitive. This will lead to Doug 4 when a clone decides to clone. This results in a distorted mental stability. Fun concept becomes predictable and unsatisfactory with his wife never knowing even after spending a long night with the clones. Directed by Harold Ramis who has fun with the material but clearly he has made superior comedies such as Caddyshack and National Lampoon's Vacation. Keaton is remarkable as all four clones who each have different personalities, and Andie MacDowell is superb as his wife, bewildered at the odd behaviours of her supposed husband.

Now, movies are not the only ones with this problem(TV sitcoms have also gone down the tubes as well), but they certainly are the most painful to sit through, since you don't have to spend money to watch a sitcom(at least not until the cable bill arrives), and they only last a half-hour.  The big problem is, instead of trying to find humor out of normal situations, these so-called comedies just try to get by on outrageous situations which may not be inherently funny anyway, and are usually more smug than funny.This movie is based on an outrageous situation, but at least director Harold Ramis and star Michael Keaton try to stick to the everyday whenever possible.  Not that there aren't belly laughs, but we understand that the main reason behind his actions is he feels he doesn't have enough time to just relax, and who can't relate to that?  Sure, as with every Ramis film, there are cloying times, especially during the end, and clone #3, the homemaker, is too much of a stereotype to work, but Keaton keeps the energy level up, he's always funny to watch, and the result is better than you'd think.

An overworked construction manager with family pressures decides to let himself be cloned-- in order to get more work done and make extra free time for himself. He soon clones himself again when he finds that he needs even more time now that he's been staying home doing the housework and caring for the kids while his wife takes up her career again. Then one of the clones goes out and clones himself, which being a copy of a copy ( a degraded simulacrum) doesn't turn out very well. They all end up having sex with his wife one night in a rowdy comedy of errors that takes Shakespeare out of romantic mistaken identity and into one a bit more hardcore. (This is of course merely suggested off screen, softly.) The clones are not exact replicas however, as their ensuing experiences are supposed to make them diverge in personality. The one who works in construction becomes stereotypically more macho. The one who does housework becomes stereotypically effeminate-- with an uncomfortable overlay of gay qualities, stereotypically conflating femininity with homosexuality. The last clone is a basket case who consists entirely of Id, since the cloning process was by now degraded. He's supposed to be the child-within or something.These can be interpreted as his Jungian unconscious also the Self is unpacked into a feminine anima and a masculine animus and must learn how to reintegrate them. He does this by having them all remodel their home -- the Jungian symbol of the self. That work involves cooperation among the conflicting clones and the common goal of saving his marriage. It includes another man who was outcast (fired) for incompetence, now brought in again as the only guy I could find on short notice --in these terms then, his Shadow.This film can be read psychologically, or about gender roles, or about postmodern simulacra and anxiety about genetic cloning, or further in terms of the current economic pressures on middle class parents to work overtime and ignore the kids (shows you need a full-time housekeeper and another wage earner before you can go golfing or boating). All of these 4 interpretive schemes overlap significantly however at the sight of an unstable masculinity. The film shows the socio-economic process that throws the male into an imaginary- technological solution which immediately becomes a psychodrama. The real social conflict revealed in resolved by the myth of the nuclear family-- or in this particular case, we should say, the genetic family.

At first I could not understand the connection between a film and a psychological problem. But then it became clear that both are about a 'fantasy'. Almost everyone in society is living a fantasy that can be as far removed or as close to reality as the person wishes. Of course, if the that person is a head of state dragging his country into war or running after Utopian dreams then the harm done is that much more greater.Now a film is also a fantasy, but it is the very exact and deliberate fantasy of the director. When we see a movie we are transported into that fantasy and we live it in vivid detail and color in all our visual and mental senses. We also live it in our subconscious senses as well, and herein lies its value. Seeing what has been thus far deeply embedded and intertwined inside us now on screen and out in the open helps begin the separation process (between reality and fantasy). Since the distinction between the fantasy of the movie and your current reality is very clear, and since you willingly entered the movie fantasy by your own choice until it overlapped with your inner similar fantasy; you can get to experience the willful 'exiting' of the movie fantasy that would subsequently help you to 'exit' your inner fantasy in the future. Well, it's a little more complicated than that, but this isn't the best place to discuss in deep psychotherapy techniques.Of course I'm not suggesting that, in and of its self, a movie would cure anybody of anything; that has to be the work of a professional, and it's his or her decision as to whether or not to incorporate it into the therapy process. But I am curious as to whether anyone else has ever 'used' movies in this sense or at least experienced their psychological effect either consciously or subconsciously.

It is surprising to see both Keaton and MacDowell starring in such a grossly low-quality piece. The basic premise of the movie A working man is pressed for time, so he buys clones of himself. The clones try to keep up with their assigned tasks, but slapstick panic ensues. Oh dear....The plot is not even internally sensible (forget about the logic of a middle-class man buying clones made through a doctor's office procedure), and plays like a filmed bullet-list of obligatory romantic-comedy scenes faxed over from Central Scripting. The interaction between Keaton and his clones doesn't exist It's just a bunch of Keaton-faces playing stereotypes who speak lines at each other, thanks to computer-enabled film effects.And if you're wondering (as I was) the answer is NO! The movie does not ask any interesting questions like If there were more of me, who would be the real me?... Instead it focuses its attention on rolling out a cheap endless treadmill of tomato-worthy clone jokes.This movie borders on the abominable, and really is too bad to even warrant this much text (it's also too awful to even laugh at). Please, for your own well-being AVOID!

When #4 informs #1 that Laura had been crying, #1 acted surprised, and I wondered why. This was her typical modus operandi; what was the big shock?3 A wife needing her husband's permission to go back to work, and then not doing it because he doesn't enthusiastically jump up and down loving the idea. (She cried, of course.)4 A stumbling explanation of why she is expected to be more maternal and nurturing than she apparently is, culminating in a blurted out, That's why you have breasts. Translation anatomy dictates role in life.Actually, Laura irked me more than Doug did. If there's one thing worse than a chauvinistic man, it's a wimpy woman who gives credence to the chauvinism.If it weren't for these things, I would have ranked Multiplicity much higher. I was terribly disappointed after having such high hopes based on the concept. I did, however, enjoy the deal with cloning #4 from #2 and getting someone who is described as special. #3's explanation about making a copy of a copy, and having it not be as sharp as the original, is probably the best part of the movie. "},{"Title":"Silly and bad","Date":"11 June 2005","Score":"1 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" Comedy about a man who doesn't have enough time on his hands for both his job, his family and himself, so he clones himself to get more time. Then the clones keep cloning themselves.The movie is silly and full of bad jokes and bad acting. I want to say that it had it's moments, but it really didn't. The jokes weren't funny or witty or well-timed, they were just the kind of jokes where you roll your eyes and sigh when you hear them. Now, this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not very far from it. But the idea's kind of good, with the cloning, but you just kind of feel like you could have done a better job yourself.

One of the major prerequisites of a comedy is that it should be funny. This movie fails dismally on this score. Unless Michael Keaton got paid 4 times his usual fee, he shouldn't have come near this with a long pole. As for Andie Macdowell, I doubt that this will get mentioned on her CV. I seriously recommend that you give this movie a wide berth, if only I had. "}]
