Imagine my surprise when I watched it on video.  It was beautiful, funny, thoughtful, smart, and wonderful.  It brings the romance of the story fully to life and touches the heart.  Sure, there are errors in history and anachronisms; but, it's a fairy tale.  King Arthur wouldn't have worn plate armor, either.Drew Barrymore delivers her best performance ever.  The accent is a bit distracting, but she is consistent with it, unlike certain Robin Hood's I could name.  She delivers on the promise she demonstrated as a youngster and brings those Barrymore genes to life.  She handles the comedy as ably as the romance.  You laugh when she first hits the Prince with an apple (pretty good shot, too!). You ache for her as her world seems to fall apart when Prince Henry learns the truth.  You cheer when she renders justice to her oppressors.Dougray Scott is a fine handsome Prince, a thinker as well as a fighter.  His eyes are opened to the world he lives in by this passionate girl.  Angelica Huston really adds the evil to the evil stepmother.  The rest of the supporting cast are uniformly great.The addition of Da Vinci, if historically incorrect, is a nice twist on the Fairy Godmother.  Who better to help a child of reason and enlightenment?This is a true romance, a rare thing in today's movies, including the so-called romantic comedies. It is a wonderful piece of work and a fine update to a classic tale.And they lived happily ever after, indeed!

Prospering despite the difficulties in their lives? Finding their true love and being with him/her despite the odds?This movie is most definitely not a retelling of the Cinderella story. It has aspects of that, the basic plotline, but a twist all its own. Gone is the pumpkin and the rats into footmen. Gone are the ugly stepsisters, the two equally horrid. No, in this one there is naturally one horrid stepsister, but the other is quite lovable. Dougray Scott is marvelously funny in his role as a Prince trying to find his way, and Angelica Huston is a brilliant evil stepmother, and Drew Barrymore makes a stunning Danielle... With other quirky characters thrown in along the way. Gustave, DaVinci, even the King and Queen are given personalities. The detail is incredible, the costumes gorgeous, and the dialogue enrapturing. This movie is counted among my most favorites, and I highly recommend it to any with a passion for romance.

It's a classic Cinderella tale set in 16th-century France and revolves around an independent young woman named Danielle. Although she works as a servant for her stepmother, Danielle is anything but weak and subservient. She is passionate and strong-willed, qualities that lead her to the French court dressed as a wealthy courtier to save a man's life. There she meets the handsome Prince Henry, who is jaded by his suffocating royal lifestyle. He is fascinated by Danielle and her thirst for life and adventure, and they fall deeply in love - but her jealous stepmother will do anything to keep them apart.Drew Barrymore turns in a stunning performance as Danielle. Her emotions are raw and realistic and she gives the character charm, wit, and beauty.Anjelica Huston brings a third dimension to her role as the evil stepmother, who is usually just portrayed as a flat character. In this movie she is an ambitious mother who would do anything to make her own daughter a queen.The Prince is also usually a pretty flat, clich√© character, but Dougray Scott brought a refreshingly human side to him and portrayed his struggles and conflicts very well.The script is strong for a romantic fairy tale and the cinematography is gorgeous. There is one scene in which Danielle is floating on her back in the river, a dreamy and breathtaking moment that describes her carefree nature perfectly. The music composed by George Fenton is lovely - I recommend the soundtrack for this movie too, especially Walking On Water.A wonderful movie for all lovers of romance! 10/10 "},{"Title":"Loved - loved - LOVED this movie!","Date":"5 February 2005","Score":"47 out of 52 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Cinderella is a timeless classic, a fairytale for all ages.

Overall, this is not so much a movie about the acting, but it's more about the sometimes sappy, usually saccharine, but wonderfully heartfelt classic story. Instead of the magic of the original fairytale, Ever After replaces it with the magic of wit, humour and heart. And there's nothing wrong with that.Funny and charming, Ever After is one of those great movies that can be watched over and over again.

We were 13, perfect age group for the film and we adored everything about this movie. It's years later and I bought the movie on DVD making me wonder if the movie did hold up as well as I remembered. Well, it doesn't hold the same magic as I saw when I was a kid, but Ever After still holds a certain charm that is absolutely irresistible. I think between the writing and the characters, this was a great update on a classic story. Every little girl has dreamed of being Cinderella, the girl who has been dumped on her whole life and then the man of your dreams comes to save you as you live happily ever after. Drew Barrymore takes lead through this charming fairy tale of a strong woman with the good faith that one day things will go as they should and she'd live in a utopia.Danielle de Barbarac is a young girl who lives in a manor with her widowed father whom she adores. When Danielle is eight, her father marries the haughty Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, who has two daughters about Danielle's age. Soon after, Auguste dies. Rodmilla is envious of Danielle, and treats her like a servant after Auguste's death. The Baroness has fallen into debt. Marguerite, her spoiled older daughter, has grown to be cruel, arrogant, and bad-tempered; while the younger, Jacqueline, is kindhearted, soft-spoken, and constantly overlooked. In the orchard one day, Danielle encounters a man attempting to steal her father's old horse. She pelts him with apples, knocking him to the ground, and is horrified to learn that the man is Henry, the Prince of France. Henry explains that his own horse was lamed in his attempt to escape stifling royal life. He forgives Danielle in exchange for her silence, and rewards her with money. Danielle resolves to use the money to rescue Maurice, an old family servant whom Rodmilla had sold. While her step-family is out of the house, Danielle dons a noblewoman's dress and goes to court. She finds Maurice about to be shipped to the Americas, and demands his release. Prince Henry sees this and is impressed with Danielle's intellect, strength of character, and beauty. Danielle refuses to tell Henry her name, though eventually she leaves him with the name of her mother, Comtesse Nicole de Lancret. Leading him to want to speak with her more only to fall in love with her not knowing that she is a true Cinderella.I still like this movie very much. Drew and the other actors may not have a great accent but they still all tried their best. Angelica Huston, what a great choice as the wicked step mother and I use that term lightly. There is this beautiful scene between her and Danielle, she starts to tell Danielle about her father and how Angelica barely knew him, you see a sense of humanity in her and then she starts to look at Danielle with love but realizes how hurt she still is that her father cared more for Danielle than his own wife. You understand how she could be angry and jealous, not justifying what she did to Danielle, but her motivation is understandable and I love the punishment she receives for what she did. There's still a scene that gets a great reaction from me, when Marguerite just spitefully tells Danielle how her mother is dead and Danielle just goes up to her and gives her one hell of a punch, I think that's when I fell in love with her! What strength was given to the character making the film more than just a happily ever after film, but a wonderful fairy tale with enjoyable characters, a wonderful romance, humor and most of all leaves you with a smile on your face.8/10 "},{"Title":"Not just another Cinderella..","Date":"8 August 1998","Score":"23 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I think Ever After was a great movie, and a must see for everyone.

For example, the girl is named Danielle, not  Cinderella. There is a nice stepsister.. and there is no Fairy Godmother,  but Leonarod Da Vinci, a guide to Danielle and the Prince. The thing that really made me want to see this movie is what Drew Barrymore  said in one of her interviews..It's so wonderful, because all girls love Cinderella. She is really a  positive rolemodel. From everything to being fiercely loyal, and incredibly  smart, and well read, to not only not waiting to be rescued, but to rescue  other people, to take the pain that she's experienced in her life, to only  have it strengthen her. And, also the fact that her heart and her mind is  what is attractive and intriguing to this wonderful prince, and not the way  she looks.Drew Barrymore played a great Cinderella.. Angelica Houston a wonderful  stepmother.. and D. Scott played a great prince. If you haven't seen it  yet.. you must! It's a great movie for everyone! Just Breathe..

When I finished watching this wonderful film, I thought that I had seen one of the best movies released this summer! And because I work in a theater, I have been able to confirm my notion that audiences of all ages (from pre-teen females to elderly couples) would enjoy this film. Drew Barrymore is tremendously appealing in the lead role, Dougray Scott is a refreshing new face that I am anxious to see again in other roles, and Anjelica Huston was terrific as the stepmother, not entirely wicked, but certainly faithful to the tale. The interesting twists concerning the stepsisters and the `fairy godmother' are just two more innovations that enhanced the appeal and character of `Ever After'. And let us not forget about Pierre LePeu as realized by Richard O'Brien, perhaps one of the most reprehensible characters I have ever seen in a conventional character-driven motion picture. I intend to add this film to my video collection as soon as it is available despite having seen it many times on the big screen. Ever After is, in my opinion, the most surprisingly satisfying moviegoing experience of the 1998 summer season.

You know the kind with magic and excitement that's supposed to have a happy ending? Since the beginning of film these stories have been adapted time and time again, interpreted in many different ways in just about every medium. What is probably the most famous Happily Ever After tale is that of the little cinder-girl. The 1950 Disney version if one of the most beloved adaptations and rightfully so, but over the next several decades the story was told and retold again rarely with much innovation. That all would change in 1998 with a film that would eschew things such as the Fairy Godmother and the warning of having to leave at the stroke of twelve, and give us a different take on the material with it's own brand of magic.Pros Amazing performances from a wonderful cast. Beautifully written. Breathtaking cinematography and French countryside. Rich production and costume designs. Lovely score. Great sense of humor. An interesting and fresh take on the story. Perfect pacing. Touching and romantic without being sappy.Cons Perhaps a bit too long. Drew Barrymore gives a fine performance, but could have worked harder on the accent.Final thoughts A near perfect masterpiece that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

Some parts no matter how many time I see them I laugh every time, even if I can quote them too.  Drew Barrymore puts on a spectacular performance, it is in my opinion one of her best films so far.  You can feel the emotion, and I even cried a few tears twice, (and I hardly cry for movies, except The Horse Whisperer).  All the actors and actresses chosen for the cast were perfect fits.  Anjelica Huston makes a very believable evil step mother.  Dougray Scott is the perfect handsome prince, and has the attitude yet sensitivity required for the role of Prince Henry.  Patrick Godfrey made a funny Leonardo, and Melanie Lynskey was perfect for the role of Jacqueline, the quite not-so-bad stepsister.  This however is probably more on the lines of a chick flick, but it isn't one that you think of usually when you think of a chick flick.  It was just a great, well rounded movie, that will captivate you into the story again and again.

A Cinderella Story.What an entertaining and magical movie. The main character Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is what drew me to the theater. I just love her charisma and charm. Unlike her girl next door norm she was very intriguing in this movie, playing an independent, strong headed, feisty peasant is a sharp contrast to anything I've seen her in before.While this story is supposed to be a version of Cinderella, it takes on twists of it's own. There is no fairy god mother. Instead there is a charming intellectual inventor Leonardo Da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey). Rather than two hideous step sisters there is one awful yet beautiful sister and one plain but kind sister. It holds true to the peasant falling in love with royalty and the prince coming to save her but this story tells so much more. The king and queen were given personality and the story gives much insight to the untold story and challenges in the life of a Prince. It helps that Prince Henry is played by a very eye catching and witty actor (Dougray Scott).Everyone loves a happy ending and this movie did not disappoint. The director built up the characters so well that you sob along with Danielle when Prince Henry pushes her away after learning the truth but then celebrate along with her when he comes to save her from the evil clutches of an adoring yet creepy wealthy man who purchases her from her step mother. As always Anjelica Houston played a wonderfully evil role and did it with class and maliciousness that only she could bring to the film.The writers, producers, directors and cast come together for the most triumphant Hollywood win since Casablanca.

Given the medieval scenery and attire, the film pulls the audience directly into the bustle of the late eighteenth century. From sword fighting, romance, comedy, and drama, this film seemingly pulls all of these aspects together into one great film. Each time that I watch this movie, I feel connected to the main character Danielle, played by Drew Barrymore. Through each climatic scene where she faces set-backs and adversity I want her to succeed and find romance in the end. This film, and more specifically Barrymore's acting, has the ability to make the audience feel sad when Danielle is rejected by the prince in front of the entire kingdom or when she is sold off to pay her step mother's debt and happy when the prince saves her and asks for her forgiveness. Although the film is set in the eighteen century, it is easy to relate to Danielle, who despite hardships, has managed to make the most out of her seemingly horrible life. This film is a retelling of the fairy tale Cinderella. With evil step mothers and sisters, an extravagant ball, a pompous prince waiting to marry for love, and even with a glass slipper, the film aligns itself with the same occurrences of the classic fairytale. Noticing the cyclical nature of fairy tales and how they are often redone, it is important to take a look at the common theme between fairy tales and their remakes. In both the fairytale version and in the movie Ever After, the main theme that is shared is that evil behavior will have repercussions and that good will always prevail. In both of the films, the step mothers serve as an oppressive force to the main protagonist. However, in Ever After one of the step sisters helps Danielle, yet comes short of advocating against her mistreatment. Nonetheless, in both of the films, the main protagonist succeeds and finds love when truly all hope seems lost. The glass slipper is probably the most apparent similarity between the two films, which indicates the importance of the symbol. At the end of Ever After, Prince Henry played by Dougray Scott, after begging Danielle for forgiveness, kneels down and replaces the slipper Danielle lost at the ball. This also happened in the classic story. Yet in Ever After, Prince Henry rejected Danielle for falsely imposing as a countess. In the final scene, Prince Henry, after saving her from Pierre Le Pieu, a vile man who is taken with Danielle played by O'Brien, has to ask Danielle to forgive him for his past actions. Although the core message has transferred between the two films, there are differences. In Ever After, Danielle does not represent the typical female fairytale character waiting idly for the price to sweep her off of her feet. Danielle has read books and often times challenges Prince Henry about various topics. Her conviction astounds Prince Henry, who falls in love with her personality over her looks. They say that behind ever great leader, is a strong woman providing support, and that notion is clearly represented in the movie, as Danielle offers her ideas on how to improve the kingdom. Ever After offers the audience the possibility to escape into a new and exciting world, where true love always prevails and evil people are always punished. In contrast to the real world, Ever After offers the audience a chance to escape into a different time period and a new life where there is always a happy ending.

So many adaptations have been done (Disney, Rodgers and Hammerstein, etc.), and this is one of the finest versions out there. The Grande Dame, disappointed with the Brothers Grimm's telling, invites them to her home, and she tells them the 'real' story a feisty young woman, trying to rescue a house servant while in disguise, attracts the attention of the prince and falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her wicked stepmother schemes to get her eldest daughter wed to the prince.What makes this film work is the performance of Drew Barrymore (probably her best performance, IMO). She can make you laugh, cry, and cheer. She is spirited without being over-dramatic. She should have been nominated for an Oscar. Angelica Huston plays an extremely nasty stepmother superbly. Dougray Scott is well-matched with Barrymore, his Prince showing a spirit similar to Drew's Cinderella. Megan Dodds is also loathsome as the eldest stepsister. My favorite aspect of the film is George Fenton's exquisite musical score, which helps add emotion to the scenes. Cinematographer Andrew Dunn's wide compositions beautifully showcases the location filming of the French countryside. Beautiful sets and costumes also contribute to this film's success. I could go on and on about this film, but I am limited in review space. If you haven't seen it, do. You won't be disappointed. 10/10. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Well, I don't know, but the creators of Ever After did it! There's no point in going over the plot, as everyone knows it. But somehow Ever After gives the age old characters a soul, a purpose, and in a way, makes them real. Danielle(Cinderella) is played beautifully by Drew Barrymore. Danielle is a strong, intelligent, brave young woman with a mind of her own. She is passionate about books, economic justice and taking pride in a day's work. This film takes a strong feminist stand on the story, making Danielle an independent woman who truly doesn't need a man. In recent years this has been done so much with fairy tales that it comes off as contrived, annoying and&#x85;false. But in Ever After the viewer doesn't feel like the writers just had angry feminists breathing down their necks; instead it gives Danielle's personality purpose. It is established early on that her father instilled the values of reading, hard work, and self-reliance. This makes Danielle a truly believable character, instead of just a feminist take on a helpless damsel. It also gives a more human take on the evil stepmother, Rodmilla (Anjelica Houston). Danielle and her stepmother are with her father when he dies, and he tells only Danielle he loves her. It's clear that Rodmilla is overcome with jealousy and feels trapped in the less than noble life her husband left for her. Along with that, only one of the stepsisters, Marguerite (Megan Dodds)is cruel to Danielle. While the favored Marguerite bullies Danielle every chance she gets, the shy and less attractive Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey) sympathizes with and even sometimes stands up for her. As for the prince&#x97;who is given the name of Henry and played by Dougray Scott, he is not very charming at all. If anything, Henry is what one would expect a prince to be, spoiled,arrogant, and frustrated. As for the fairy Godmother, she is replaced by Leonardo DaVinci! While it sounds ridiculous at first, this works very well with the rest of the story. Danielle's relationship with the prince is also much more realistic. They do not meet for the first time at the ball, but interact and date several times before. This allows the characters to have a much meatier romance based on getting to know each other, rather than a shallow love at first sight. Henry's reaction to finding out Danielle is a servant also seems much more true to life. Instead of looking past her humble beginnings and lies, he is furious and forces her away from the castle. Only after DaVinci talks sense into Henry does he seek Danielle out again for a reconciliation and their happily ever after.When you know the story of Cinderella in and out, it is refreshing and surprising when someone actually finds a new and engaging way to tell it. Ever After does just that, by giving depth to its characters and making the entire situation sound realistic. This is my favorite version of Cinderella, and the kind of movie you can watch over and over again.

It's a classic Cinderella tale set in 16th-century France and revolves around an independent young woman named Danielle. Although she works as a servant for her stepmother, Danielle is anything but weak and subservient. She is passionate and strong-willed, qualities that lead her to the French court dressed as a wealthy courtier to save a man's life. There she meets the handsome Prince Henry, who is jaded by his suffocating royal lifestyle. He is fascinated by Danielle and her thirst for life and adventure, and they fall deeply in love - but her jealous stepmother will do anything to keep them apart.Drew Barrymore turns in a stunning performance as Danielle. Her emotions are raw and realistic and she gives the character charm, wit, and beauty.Anjelica Huston brings a third dimension to her role as the evil stepmother, who is usually just portrayed as a flat character. In this movie she is an ambitious mother who would do anything to make her own daughter a queen.The Prince is also usually a pretty flat, clich√© character, but Dougray Scott brought a refreshingly human side to him and portrayed his struggles and conflicts very well.The script is strong for a romantic fairy tale and the cinematography is gorgeous. There is one scene in which Danielle is floating on her back in the river, a dreamy and breathtaking moment that describes her carefree nature perfectly. The music composed by George Fenton is lovely - I recommend the soundtrack for this movie too, especially Walking On Water.

Putting the original Grimm folk tale aside, Cinderella is a story about compassion and love. Looking at it as a kids story never worked for me. The old Disney cartoon was just alright I guess. The 2015 version is pretty crappy to say the least. I'm being literal when saying I don't think it should be for kids. Surely, it also shouldn't be about cutting your feet off either. What it should be about is a slow building romance between a high power and a low power in hiding. That's what I am here to talk about today. Ever After a Cinderella story does everything perfectly in my mind. It is basically the prefect telling of the Cinderella story. I wasn't to sure what to expect from this movie because of the other Cinderella adaptations I've seen. I thought it would just be another unrealistic tale about mice and getting wishes granted by fairy god mothers. Weather you agree with me or not, that stuff is candy compared to the pure green that this movie delivers. Surely it's not all prefect, and it can be cheesy from time to time, but what this movie really wants to focus on is how developed the relationship between the prince and the slave are. This is something that I haven't really seen in any other Cinderella story. Cinderella 2015 tried this, but it didn't feel fleshed out enough for me to call in fantastic. Romance in fiction should be about character development, and seeing the characters interact, which is something this movie mastered. I don't wanna spoil anything because I actually want people to see this movie. The acting show between the two leads is as perfect as it can be. Not to mention, almost all the acting is great. Almost everyone has their time to shine, and many of the characters like Leonardo da Vinci show up regularly just so it didn't feel like they were just a short mention. Very quickly I have to talk about how natural the costume and set design is even for a moment in like this. Surprisingly when I'm talking about cheesy, this is something the set and costume never feels like even though it's suppose to. The thing about it is, the set and costume design is what makes this movie feel like Cinderella. It doesn't bother me, but take that aspect away, and I don't think I'd be praising this movie as a Cinderella movie.In conclusion, Ever After is possibly the best Cinderella adaptation I've ever seen. I wish more people would watch this movie, I hope to show my friends this movie, and it's all in all really thought out. This movie doesn't need a fairy god mother to keep it on its feet. Weather it happened to work or not, I think it worked. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Intrepid heroine, an above-average Hollywood pap","Date":"17 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" A romance-comedy retells the story of Cinderella, directed by Andy Tennant (SWEET HOME ALABAMA 2002, HITCH 2005 and FOOL'S GOLD 2008), in an attempt to revamp the fairytale with a historical context, in the early 16th century, France. A beautiful young girl Danielle (Barrymore), who is being treated as a servant by her stepmother, the baroness Rodmilla (Huston) after the sudden death of her father Auguste (Krabb√©). Upon a chance meeting with Prince Henry (Scott), a romantic feeling has seized both of them, but Danielle is in her courtier disguise, in a moment of desperation, she uses her dead mother's name to hide her real identity.While running from an arranged marriage from his parents King Francis I (West) and Queen Marie (Parfitt), Henry decides to marry the girl his heart really wants, so Rodmilla has an eye to the main chance to marry off her own daughter Marguerite (Dodds), and she has no qualms to hamper the true love between Danielle and Henry at all cost. The storyline is basically the same with the fairytale, but all the fantasy elements have been entirely trimmed off, no fairy godmother, no pumpkin carriage, even the slipper has no magic, instead, a real historical figure, Leonardo da Vinci (Godfrey) is introduced as the game-changer, with his painting MONA LISA, which was actually purchased by King Francis I.One refreshing upgrade of the story is that Danielle's characteristic has been rendered a modern retouch, she is no longer a damsel in distress, she is the ill-fated Cinderella, but she doesn't need her knight errant to rescue her out of her misery, on the contrary, it is her who saves Henry from a gypsy mob by pluckily carrying him on her shoulder, and near the coda, it is also herself who defeats the Gothic-looking merchant Pierre Le Pieu (O'Brien) even before Henry's arrival, set side by side with Kenneth Branagh's flashier Cinderella (2015), EVERAFTER is unwaveringly innovatory to elevate its heroine out of the clich√© and more modest in its art production.So much for the good intention, the script still seems unbalanced, Marguerite's wilful turning against her mother is the work of a sophomoric writing, so is Henry's sudden change of mind, these parts are unfortunately being rushed out without thoughtful polishing. Barrymore's winsome appearance can smoothly erase viewers' memories about her problematic child-star past, and the film does revive her career, at the age of 23, she manages to pull off a second life on the big screen. This movie also marks Dougray Scott's Hollywood breakthrough, but one might argue, his sombre mien doesn't quite fit the role as an unsophisticated prince (maybe Jude Law would be a better casting choice), his Prince Henry is not dewy-eyed enough to believably amazed by Danielle's class-defying viewpoint and her extremely ample vigour for life, and his natural reserves doesn't help either.As always, the evil stepmother is the most delectable part, and who can portray unbearable haughtiness better than the almighty Anjelica Huston? She is absolutely a hoot to watch, period. Melanie Lynskey's Jacqueline, Danielle's other step-sister, is another surprise, she is more defiant towards her mother and more sympathetic to Danielle, and wonderfully throws the last bon mot of course not, mother, I'm here just for the food. in the otherwise bromide-laden ending.

But will he love Danielle for her real self and not as a countess named Nicole(who is the name of Danielle's deceased mother)?. Overall I really enjoyed this version as well as it had more screen time with Danielle and the prince BUT I have a few issues with it.1. What is Leonardo Di Vinci got to do with Cinderella? Cinderella has a fairy godmother NOT a famous painter.2. Shouldn't Henry assume that the countess was Danielle since he seen her face before?3. The romance between the prince and Danielle was very well done and Danielle is a very headstrong girl who can stand up to herself,but Cinderella wasn't like that at all.Bottom line I must be the only person who prefers Lily James' outtake of Cinderella but I grew up with the tale of a young servant girl who wins the heart of her prince and doesn't meet him until the ball and she loses a glass slipper and doesn't tell the prince who she is or her name.This was a good movie too but like I said I prefer Lily James' version.7/10Kudos though for not having Ever After predicable even though parts of it was as I knew Danielle would be with the prince in the end.

Danielle's best friend named Gustave. They've been best friends since bard omen when Danielle often used to wrestle him in the mud so they both became dirty and wet. Gustave always helps Dannielle when she is in trouble and make her happy when she's sad.Danielle's inner qualities is that she's kind and think about how others feel. Her external qualities is that she is beautiful that makes Prince Henry immediately falls in love with her.Prince Henry is a typical teenager who has no plans to become king. He wants to explore the world outside the castle walls and can accommodate therefore often away, but a stolen horse and return to the castle when he feels like it. Henry is also the person in the film that goes through the biggest change of all.

When he meets Danielle who is thinking very much about how others feel so Henry can not understand quite how she thinks. But the more they get hit Dannielle him think '' right ''. At the end of the film, he has become a very wise prince who thinks of others and not just yourself.My favorite person in the film is Leonardo Da Vinci for his help and is fun in the way he behaves. You also get to see another side of Leonardo Da Vinci, much more fun than what he thinks when he sees and his paintings in books and online.The film's ending is that Danielle has been captured by Le Pieu. Because her father taught her swordsmanship, she uses a sword, forcing Le Pieu to give her the key to his castle so she can get out of there. The film's end was as I expected so I did not get any special feeling.

It is Danielle's strength of character; ability and desire to act decisively and to be consistently honest that brings her from a servant/slave of a cold-hearted step mother, to queen. Although this story was modeled on the fairy tale Cinderella, I do not feel that that handicaps or otherwise restrains the movie. Rather, this may be the best feature-length movie based on that fairy tale. Beforehand, I'd only seen Drew in The Wedding Singer (good movie, but she is not given a dynamic part like in Ever After) and Never Been Kissed (I loathe that movie, because, as in The Wedding Singer, she is trapped in the middle of someone else's plans). Drew Barrymore, as Danielle, shows no such timidity or ambiguity in Ever After. It's always good to see Melanie Lynskey, as well.

Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) can't stand his home, and runs into Danielle one day as well as Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) rescuing his Mona Lisa painting. Leonardo would be the fairy godmother.Drew Barrymore is doing a weird British accent in a costume drama taking place in 16th century Italy. There are castles and horses but little grandeur. Although it's a nice idea, it doesn't have any tension or magic. It's not gritty enough to be real nor beautiful enough to be fanciful.

Basically, set in the early 19th Century, France, wealthy landowner Auguste (The Living Daylights' Jeroen Krabb√©) married Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Anjelica Huston), and after he died she inherited his fortune. She also forced his only daughter Danielle (Drew Barrymore) to become a slave, her stepmother treating her like dirt, and her stepsisters almost as bad, Marguerite (Megan Dodds) being the horrid one, and only Jacqueline (Heavenly Creatures' Melanie Lynskey) being the relatively kinder one. The young girl stays positive though that one day things will change for the better, and that dream may come true when Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) wants to escape the life in the kingdom, only to be spotted trying to flee by her. She is paid to be silent, which she does remain, and the Prince meanwhile comes across the famous painter Leonardo Da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) heading for the royal court with his famous Mona Lisa painting, and returning to the castle the Prince settles back. He also meets the Baroness who hopes that he will marry Margurite, but they are unaware that Danielle is using the money she received to improve her image, and pose as a courtier dressed like a fine Lady, and he is attracted not just by her beauty, but her spirit. After giving herself the name Nicole De Lancret, after her mother, and the title Comtesse, she is forced to run away, taking servant Maurice (Walter Sparrow) with her, and the next thing we see is King Francis (Timothy West) making a deal with his son, he must announce his engagement to a woman he chooses by the stroke of midnight at a ball in five days, otherwise he will marry Spanish Princess Gabriella (Virginia Garc√≠a). During the next few days Danielle keeps up the pretence of being in the higher class of people, and she does eventually bump into the Prince again who is delighted to see her, and it comes to the night of the ball, but he discovers the truth about her identity. In the end his feelings for her are too strong and he forgive any deception of being a slave, and after finally ridding herself of the her horrid stepmother and stepsister Danielle escapes, and it is a happily ever after for Henry and Danielle. Also starring Judy Parfitt as Queen Marie and Jeanne Moreau as Grande Dame. Barrymore gives a good natural performance as the downtrodden but spirited beauty, Scott is good as the Prince who wants to get his own and find his true love, and of course Huston is a good choice as the nasty stepmother who treats the beauty with contempt and only cares about money and going higher in society. This is not your typical version of Cinderella, there is no magic, no glass slippers, no pumpkin carriage and no Fairy Godmother, this is a more grown up version that treats the story as if it is historical fact, so traditional medieval era costumes and locations, but the premise remains relatively the same, it is an interesting romantic fantasy. Very good!

Her father comes home with a new step-mother Rodmilla, played by Angelica Huston who in my opinion plays the perfect evil stepmother. She has two daughters Marguerite and Jacqueline played by Megan Dodds and Melanie Lynskey. Marguerite is the spoiled doting elder daughter who is spoiled rotten, and poor Jacqueline always is downplayed.This is the best movie that I have ever watched Drew Barrymore where I like her and the character that she plays.

A baroness who looks on Drew Barrymore, her step-daughter with utter contempt and disdain, for in this version, she soon realizes that she must get rid of her created Cinderella so that her daughter, Marguerite, can marry the prince. Do I see that the other step-daughter was actually sympathetic to the Barrymore Cinderella character?The prince's father comes off as a real idiot here.

I cried many times, in both joy and sorrow, as the story unfolded. The first viewing I shall never forget. The 10th viewing I shall never forget, even better than the first 9 viewings!Humble Danielle (Cinderella) tries to set everything straight with the prince, attempting to explain that she is a mere peasant girl commoner, and not of royal blood. But the prince loves her so much, he never gives her a chance to confess. Then when the time comes for the confession, it is the wrong time! Her confession is turned aside to her destruction and grief at the grand costume ball. She comes into the scene of the resplendent mask ball festivity, dressed as the most noble and beautiful creature imaginable, with gorgeous white gown and gossamer angel wings, to the rapturous thrill of the Prince, the Queen, and the King. The Prince is love-struck. But two or three minutes later, after her true identity is revealed by her heartless step mother who reveals everything, Danielle (Cinderella) leaves the scene humiliated and in tears, with wings clipped (literally one wing torn off), losing her glass slipper on the way, as she runs to escape from the Prince and depart the royal costume ball, a totally humiliated peasant girl dashing into the cold dark night of a fierce rainstorm. She ends up soaking wet and grief stricken, wearing one glass slipper and one broken angel's wing, sobbing uncontrollably in a tattered wedding gown that is filthy and ruined, weeping in the soaking rain, while thunder and lightning are roaring all around her.Oh my, oh my!

No; this movie doesn't have a lot to offer the gritty crowd who'd be happier watching Sin City.

Her Cinderella does not wait for fate; she takes action. She is strong-willed, beautiful, and adventurous, but she never bashes it over your head. She is very vulnerable too. Angelica Huston is a great evil stepmother. She plays the part with relish. She is very elegant, calculated and manipulative, borderline sociopath.

In this movie, Danielle comes to the prince's rescue a few times, and she also offers him advice and words of wisdom.Also unlike any other Cinderella story, the fairy godmother in this story is the famous French artist/inventor Leonardo de Vinci (Patrick Godfrey).I found this movie very well acted and directed, the costumes were beautiful and the way the Renaissance was captured was brilliant. Overall there was no disappointment other than the fact that since it is another Cinderella story and it followed the same story line, therefore making it a little predictable.

I found it quite entertaining, even if there are maybe a few lapses in writing. The plot is quite good, and progresses nicely throughout. The pacing is fair. The dialog is well-written and equally delivered. The acting is all pretty good... it was a pleasant surprise to see Melanie Lynskey(whom I so far have only seen one other place... as Rose on Two and a Half Men, a role that doesn't require all that much talent) play a much more grounded character, and do so very well. Dougray Scott was good. Anjelica Huston portrayed the evil stepmother of the story really good. Barrymore was well-chosen for the tom-boyish lead who is not stripped of feminine traits. The humor is decent... personally, I didn't laugh much, though several of Drew's character's actions had me cheering for her. The cinematography and editing was quite good throughout. The prelude and prologue are both well-written and fit in well with the tone and direction of the film. The mood isn't too sweet and while this is a fairy tale, it still managed to entertain me(and I have never found works in that genre to be of any interest to me). The only thing I truly didn't like about this was the line near the beginning which tried to place one definite meaning upon the smile of the Mona Lisa. I refer to the marvelously talented director Stanley Kubrick, who quite eloquently and perfectly expressed why such a thing should never be done. I recommend this to fans of fairy tales and/or the actors involved. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Cinderella A Historical Romance","Date":"26 July 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Ever After (1998) Starring Drew Berrymore, Dougray Scott, Angelica Houston, Megan Dodds, Melanie Lynskey, Jeroen Krabbe, Richard O'Brien, Judy Parfitt, Patrick Godfrey, Timothy West, Judy Parfitt, Lee Inbleby, Kate Lansbury, Walter Sparrow, Jeanne Moreau, Peter Gunn, Toby Jones, Joerg Stadler, Andy Henderson, Al Hunter Ashton, Christian Marc, Elvira Stevenson, Ursula Jones, Alex Pooley, John Walters, Janet Henfrey, Rupam Maxwell, Jean-Piere Mazieres....Director Andy Tennant... Screenplay Susannah Grant, Rick Parks.Whether they lived happily ever after is not the point, gentlemen, the point is ... they lived. Based on the 1729 French novella by Charles Perrault (who wrote dozens of the fairy tales we all grew up hearing as children- Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, etc), this is a 1998 film by director Andy Tennant who turns the familiar Cinderella story into a lush, Renaissance Era historical romance. What makes this particular Cinderella stand out is that it's structure never succumbs to the dullness of the repetitive formula of the other well-known Cinderellas. The Cinderella in this story is a beautiful Baroness painted by Leonardo Da Vinci during 1500's France. Her great grand-daughter, an old Countess, has possession of the painting which she happily shows off to her guests and proceeds to tell them the story of the real life historic Cindrella. This is a superb film, and deceptive at first, considering the fact that Ever After, at face value and judging from the posters and previews back in the late 90's looked to be a fantasy/escapist bore starring a costume-clad Drew Berrymore and Angelica Houston who were doing roles that were beneath them. Far from it. Screenwriters Susannah Grant and Richard Parks did a marvelous job of adapting a classic fairy tale into a well-written historical film set in rural, Renaissance France with strong, well-developed characters and a substantial plot. Drew Berrymore stars as Danielle De Barbarac, the unloved daughter of her wicked stepmother Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Angelica Houston), who hopes to groom her own daughters Marguerite and Jacqueline (Megan Dodds and Melanie Linskey). The familiar Cinderella story we all know does not kick in until much later in the film, in fact, toward the end of the film. Before that we are treated to a great female character - she's highly independent, democratic, intelligent and an irrepressible country girl, friends with the farm-hands and local village folk, a young lady, who, despite ill treatment by her stepmother, poses as an inner nobility. She manipulates scenes in order to teach feudal Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) lessons in the real world and how the other half lives. The two of them, despite some initial antagonism, fall in love long before she goes to the ball, making this a very realistic, human love story stripped of all the Disney and Rodgers and Hammerstein's gloss. A greater chemistry between Cinderella and her Prince you'd be hard-pressed to find, especially because the other versions fall flat on realistic romantic chemistry. Barrymore and Scott's chemistry is terrific on this film. The cinematography by Andrew Dunn is sumptuous. You can get lost in the vistas of great forests, rural towns and marketplaces, as well as old ch√¢teaux. The costumes are true to what people of their class wore in the Renassiance. Even Leonardo Da Vinci is a prominent character in the story, making this Cinderella a different animal than the other versions, certainly more thought-provoking. There is a very literary feel to all of this, as if Cinderella is more than just a fairy tale and it feels as if the screenplay were being lifted from a historical romance novel. The music by George Fenton is appropriately Baroque, romantic and airy. The actors are delivering strong performances, taking themselves as seriously as Oscar hopeful stars, despite the fact that sometimes the dialog and script suffers from a Shakespearean and old-fashioned tone. Angelica Houston delivers her usual good performance. As the Stepmother, she is deliciously wicked. While the film never strays from the heart of the Cinderella romance, which by modern feminist standards is about a woman who waits passively for her Prince Charming and for life to improve, this is a story that is balanced by a strong, feminist, forward-thinking, modern Cinderella who needs no rescuing and makes things happen for herself using her intelligence, skills and personal merit. It was the 90's after all, a time when women's roles on film were neither weak or sexist. This is a gorgeous and very well-made movie and I highly urge for parents to get their children, especially girls, who are drowning with lack of good female role models. A remarkable movie sure to delight and enthrall everyone, young and old.

Just think of all of the television adaptations of fairy tales that fall short of their intended mark. This story, however, succeeds in being clever and sweet, while still maintaining the basic elements of the classic story. There is an evil stepmother who works the main character to the bone, evil stepsisters (or at least one evil stepsister), a prince who is looking for a wife, our heroine posing as nobility to win the prince's heart, and a glass slipper. Only, instead of a fairy godmother, we have Leonardo da Vinci.The actors are interesting, the dialogue funny and touching. True Dougray Scott may be a little too mature to play the immature prince, but he is so wonderful that you forget his age. Drew Barrymore is delightful, and is brilliant when it comes to humor. Angelica Huston and Megan Dodds are deliciously evil, and Melanie Lynskey is well-cast as the sweeter and less glamorous of the stepsisters.In short, this film would make a wonderful addition to your family's film collection, and would make a particularly nice gift for a young girl.

Credit goes to George Fenton's music that added more heights in storytelling; Drew Barrymore's portrayal of being an underdog; Anjelica Huston's portrayal of an evil stepmother (she's not bad at all, though it will be different story if the director shows how Danielle was lashed like Christ&#151;you will truly hate her).

The writer does a great job of changing the expectations that we already knew from the popular tale. Knowing the premise of the story, he was still able to keep me involved enough to want to know HOW they would arrive at the point of 'happily ever after'. Drew was surprisingly likable (as I said in the title...I'm not much of a fan of hers) and she gave the pauper-like character much needed soul. I also thought Angelica Huston did a fantastic job as the Stepmother because in the original tale, I remember her as just 'mean'. But in this story, I actually felt moments of softened humility from a the known 'hardened' character. I rated this movie high because if given the opportunity...I would even watch it again. Way to go Drew! "},{"Title":"Romantic Retelling at its best","Date":"10 January 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I assume all have seen this movie. If you haven't, go see it now.I am a single mid-twenties male and Ever After is my favorite romantic comedy, which is normally an unappealing genre for my demographic. I would vote for Ever After over any Rambo/Stallone flick for entertainment value for one night.Everything about Ever After is well done to excellent. Acting, costumes, plot twists, humor, dialog, scenery, music ... everything. This movie's ending is extremely satisfying, where everyone gets what they deserve. In short, the movie is well-executed entertainment.Upon further viewings, you begin to notice things, both good and bad. You see the Baroness's hurtful gaze at Danielle as August dies, Jacqueline's conflicts that almost parallel Danielle's, Margueritte's jaw dropping upon seeing Princess Danielle, and how Le Pew isn't really a bad guy for recognizing the beauty, radiance, and spirit inside Danielle that everyone else is blind to, only for his methods of approach.But, unfortunately, you also notice some bad things. There are factual and historic flaws, some less-than-perfect accents and dialog, and some not-completely believable events between the characters, with varying scales of forgiveness depending on the critic. However, remember that this is a retelling of a magic-filled bedtime fairy tale. If you are unable to suspend your disbelief for these overlook-able quirks in a movie, you probably like the original Cinderalla tale too much or too little and do not enjoy many movies for entertainment's sake.Danielle is not the most physically attractive character, that being 'Margueritte Francious Louise of the House of Ghent', but she outshines everyone as the most beautiful character, doing her common birth father and legendary mother proud. Leonardo Da Vinci plays the Fairy Godmother, having his fabled intelligence and artistry adding literally visual sparks to the movie, yet his dialog makes him the 'no bull-crap' character, which allows him to remind the prince to stop being a prince and Danielle to stop being Danielle and recognize they are a man and woman in love. "},{"Title":"Drew enchants as a fiery Cinders","Date":"27 December 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This 1998 movie is a delightful take on the Cinderella fairy tale, largely due to the personality and talent of Drew Barrymore who effortlessly blends innocence and feistiness as Danielle de Barbarac who, after her father dies, is downgraded to a servant by her harsh and greedy stepmother (Angelica Houston). Also in attendance of course are two stepsisters (Megan Dodds and Melanie Lynskey) though they are far from ugly, and the latter has quite a lot of sympathy with poor put-upon Danielle.Enter a handsome, dashing Prince Charming, in the form of 16th century real-life Henri (Dougray Scott), son of the French King, Francois I (Timothy West). He falls for Danielle, under the impression that she is a noble lady, not a commoner and menial, and lots of misunderstanding and intrigues ensue. One of the cleverer aspects of the film is the presence of Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) who was in fact brought to France (where he died) by Francois. Another realistic surprise is some sharp social criticism - voiced by Danielle - partially based on Thomas More's book, Utopia, whose publication pre-dated Henri.Where, however, the screenplay is a fairy tale of its own is that Henri far from being charming was ruthlessly cruel when he became King Henri II; also, needless to say, there was no Danielle de Barbarac in his life. The film was shot in France, with lots of picturesque scenery and ch√¢teaux to admire. Finally, another good reason to view this movie is a brief appearance by Jeanne Moreau in her 70th year; but this was by no means her final film - according to IMDb, she's made another 15 since then!. "},{"Title":"Ever After","Date":"15 December 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Shades of Character In Ever After warm and cool colors was exceptionally symbolic. Jacqueline and Danielle wore cool colors, portraying them as pleasant, sweet, and caring, while Marguerite and the Baroness wore warm colors giving them an aura of cruelty, wickedness, and threat. To contrast these colors, Leonardo da Vinci was always wearing white, characterizing him as pure, serene, and godly. My first experience leading up to watching this film was when I saw Cinderella for the first time at a very young age. I then watched Ever After, a modern portrayal of the fairy tale, as a sixth grader with my mom. Since then I have probably watched it fifty times but on September 29th I saw it with new eyes film student eyes.Jacqueline and Danielle (Cinderella) were always seen in sweet, cheerful, cool colors, whether they are sparkly and grand or just plain old blue. These colors make them fade into the background, especially when they are around others in warm colors, and it is their smiles and personalities that make them stand out. This pattern of beauty incognito can be traced up until the very end of the movie when the audience is shocked as Danielle wears red, to symbolize her change in character and status. In this scene alone positions are reversed and the devious Baroness and Marguerite wear blue. One example of this is when Danielle and Jacqueline are wearing very similar dresses and Jacqueline is bandaging Danielle's back after she has been whipped by the baroness. This scene marks a drastic change in Jacqueline's character in that she has embraced her mother's favoritism of Marguerite, and turns around to find a friend in her stepsister. Another scene that portrays this contrast is that of Danielle wearing her mothers light blue gown as she goes to court and buys back her friend Maurice who was sold by the baroness. This was the first time that Danielle displayed an open selflessness and even in her cool, often unnoticed color she stood out as a charming, passionate individual. On their way to the mask ball, Marguerite wears a brilliant red and the Baroness a dusty maroon. These colors present quite the contrast to Jacqueline's ordinary blue and Danielle's ragged gray dress. Although we can tell that Jacqueline is above Danielle in this scene, it is also clear that she is not as high up as Marguerite.Marguerite and the Baroness wore warm colors giving them an image of aggressiveness, anger, and evil. One scene that demonstrates this is when Marguerite brings the queen a rosary telling her that she dropped it on the way out, this of course is a deceitful lie. She is put into a bright red and among all the blue and earth tones to make her stand out like a sour thumb. The mise en scene in this frame was also very centered on the spoiled Marguerite. She is placed in the middle of the frame in her bright red while around her avid churchgoers swarm out in their blues, greens, and purples. The Baroness herself is always wearing black or very dusky shades of shadowy colors. Adding to her clothing the actor herself has jet black hair and pasty white skin. This extreme contrast of dark on white makes her look frail and all the more frightening. The scene when the baroness and her daughters arrive at Danielle's home presents a nice picture of these colors. The baroness steps daintily out of the carriage in her elaborate black gown and is followed by little Jacqueline in blue and Marguerite in her usual red. The feelings of fear, intimidation, and evil are all suggested by the vivid colors worn by these characters. To say that the fairy godmother was omitted from this interpretation would be an outright lie. In Ever After we are given Leonardo da Vinci, who is always seen in white. He is truly the one who saves Danielle, giving her the wings she needs to fly. It is simple to make the connection between da Vinci and Christ, and it is his serene white that triggers the imagination. In one scene he walks out to Danielle in his floating shoes and proclaims her an angel. This scene sticks very firmly in the mind. The cinematographer gave a shot of the whole scene from water level. We can see da Vinci dressed from head to toe in his white robes and Danielle floating along in her blue and white. This amazing shot demonstrates da Vinci's ability to go out of the reach of the human mind and help a soul lost and in need of guidance. In yet another scene da Vinci saves Danielle from missing the Mask Ball by opening the door that she was locked in. He is immediately praised, though he is very modest in responding, yes, I shall go down in history as the man who opened the door. Da Vinci is everything a girl could ask for in a fairy godmother and more, for you see, he is god.Ever After is a wonderfully put together reproduction of Cinderella that is perfect for girls who need a little escape back to childhood.

This shows status because only the rich and or wealthy people could afford the bright colored clothes. Oddly enough Danielle's dress at the end is white and the men wear dim colors. I have seen this movie a million times. This time I watched by myself in my bedroom. The first time I watched this movie was when I was eight years old with my grandmother in her living room. She told me that if a man treated me less then the prince then he wasn't good enough for me. That is why I am dating Spud. The dresses that the courtiers wear are bright reds and greens. They dress in extremely bright colors and voluptuous clothes. They wore low cut clothes that exposes cleavage that no one really wanted to see. They would wear extremely heavy jewelry that looked like ridicules children's fake jewelry that you would get from a cracker jacks box. You would even see them wearing pastel colors yet they were bright. They would fight with the suppliers on the prices if they were too high and they dress wasn't very bright or bold. They also wore brooches that were as big as an apple. The dresses that the peasants wore were extremely dim colored. They looked like spare material that you would find in the back of a Salvation Army storage room that was musty, moldy, and moth-eaten and had probably been there since the 1980's. They are lightly colored and look extremely faded. Even when they would dress up the dresses were a faded color. The peasants work clothes were even worse, they were moth-eaten and nasty. I believe that they were nasty colored because their masters bought them and didn't feel like spending much money on them so they got the cheapest things that they could find. The only time a peasant would wear a brooch was when they were going to a party and even then they were very small brooches. Oddly enough the dress that Danielle wears to the ball is white. So it is kind of bold and dim at the same time so we do not know what she is exactly feeling. The other thing is that the men in this movie wear dim colors. Good movie I loved it so much. Enjoy.

Ever After is a retelling of the classic Cinderella story minus the magic pumpkins and talking mice. Set in France this story is a classic romance about a prince and a common girl who fall in love.Angelica Houston is perfect as the horrible step mother who you love to hate. But rather than just being some raving villain, what I like most about this movie is you see her side of the story. She is a woman all alone in a man's world who just lost a husband, to whom she would always come second. Second that is, to his daughter Cinderella (Drew Berymore). Dougray Scott is the wayward prince of France who struggles with his own doubts on love. Most charming in this role, we all can identify with his confused monologue debating over the concept of true love. Rather than a fairy Godmother we have a fairy Godfather in the person of Leonardo Davinci. Every actor was chosen well and wonderful in their roles; all working together to give this tale a heart and soul you won't find in any other telling of the story. This is one of the best romantic works of film, and if u want to watch a movie to fall in love with, be in love Ever After.

I watch it for the love story that it is and not for its historical accuracies. I think people need to remember that movies are made for entertainment not history lessons. If you want a history lesson read a history book.I enjoyed this movie because it does take you away from everyday life even if it is only for two hours,(which I could watch another two hours if they continued the story). I happily found that the Danielle's(Drew Barrymore) character wasn't your average Cinderella. She had more to her than good looks which today's society often only sees in a person. She was smart, well-read, and portrayed that to a prince no less, where as many girls would be a ball of giggles and have a look at me I'm pretty attitude that Margurete portrays. As for the prince,(Dougray Scott, who is just fabulous) I thought his character was refreshing. He based his decision not on looks, like many other fairy tales do, but on what she was on the inside. Also, they made his character even more human by showing his faults and weaknesses. I too would probably run out on a person who you just were told that she was engaged(cheating) and lied about who she was. I think any ordinary person would be just as angry. That makes his character one that you can relate to, because I'm sure not allot of people can relate to a person of royalty.Well, enough of my thoughts. I rate this movie a 10 out of a 10.

Cinderella was called that because she used to play with the cinders in the fire. Her real name was not mentioned in the fairy tale so it could have very well been 'Danielle'.Anyway! good reproduction of the fairy tale. Great acting! Superb costume work. Awesome and realistic atmosphere with no hints of rock music, as was heard in 'a knight's tale'. The characters were well done The King looked really like a king, the Queen looked like a queen, the stepmother like the stepmother in the story and Cinderella looked like..well.. Cinderella. Imagining them that way was quite easy.Anyway! the bottom line is that though the movie is merely a fairy tale, it is worth watching. The dialogue is mot juste, and some of the scenes are very well done and not to be missed. Look out for the part where the dance begins at the ball. The coordinated dancing in a circle at the center of the dance floor is quite nice to see.Overall Score 8/10-Spoilers-The thing that puzzled me most was the fact that one of the step sisters was actually one of the good guys. I thought that both were supposed to be rotten. Still, she was cute and it wasn't the perfect match towards the fairy tale or else there would have been a fairy godmother popping up... and that would have made it a fantasy movie. Another thing that got me thinking was the fact that the part in the fairy tale where the godmother's spell lasted till 12 midnight was not included at all. I thought they could have brought that element in somewhere making the Grim brothers include it in the tale. Pity about that.

I was on a military base with nothing better to do, so I saw it at our local theater. What did I expect?  A lot of nothing, really.  Drew Barrymore hasn't acted since Firestarter... maybe not even then.Wow, was I wrong!For the first time I'd ever seen, Drew actually acted!  She portrayed pain, hope, love, betrayal, determination... and so very much more!  And what a cast to support her talents!!  Anjelica Huston, as usual, rocked as the wicked and demented stepmother, giving a convincing portrayal of a character many of us grew up with in our youth.As for the rest... from props to sets to plots to dialogue, this film captivates from beginning to end.  Everything is just fairy-tale enough to be enjoyable, which a lot of people confuse for 'anachronism' or 'inaccuracy'.  It's a fairy tale, people - it's supposed to be this way.If there is a down side to this film, it comes from the forced accents used by several of the actors (including Drew) and the fickle nature of the Prince when he learns of his beloved's true nature.  Overall, I give this one 9/10.

It's a cute love story, that defies the expectations of social and economic class. It also shows how people should never lose their sense of self, no matter what happens to them in life.  Danielle stays who she is throughout her whole life, regardless of how her step mother treated her, and regardless of the fact that she was a peasant.  If anything, because of her circumstances, she became an even stronger person, and that was probably one of the reasons she was so appealing to the prince.  The only thing that bothers me is their accents.  They were not bad accents, if the movie was about English people. The movie is set in France, so therefore they should be french.  Are french accents really that hard or something?  I don't get it why people do that in movies.  This is not the first time I've seen it happen.  Well anyways, I digress, and will get to the point.  This is a great movie.  This is a great movie for anyone in the mood for a great chick flick.

The acting, costumes, cinematography, and writing were all perfect in recreating a fairy tale. The movie was very satisfying. Drew Barrymore is very good at playing this type of role as seen in Never Been Kissed and even The Wedding Singer. She was also backed by a terrific supporting cast. Angelica Huston and the director made the right choice in not playing her character over the top. I though that made her come across as even more nasty since it was a naturalistic persona we were seeing. Recommended, 8/10.  "},{"Title":"Gives the fairy tale some interesting context","Date":"3 August 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  One of my friends had been praising this movie for some time, so one day I saw the video at Target and bought it for her. Later on we sat down and watched it, and it was surprisingly a very sweet, realistic telling of the classic Cinderella fairy tale. The thing about the Grimm version that always bugged me was the fact that the prince couldn't just go out and LOOK for this girl. Why did he need the glass slipper when all he had to do was recognize her? Was the prince unable to remember her face at all? Thankfully Ever After ditches that plot hole and the fantasy elements and tells the tale realistically. There is no fairy godmother, and instead we get Leonardo Da Vinci. Also, the evil stepmother and stepsisters are actually given some depth. Instead of just being traditionally Eeeevil, we learn that the stepmother acts the way she does because she was treated harshly by her father. And it was really neat how one stepsister was basically a spoiled brat while the other just submitted to her relative's actions without objection. By the end of the movie (spoilers!), that character revealed herself to be understanding and very sensitive to Danielle's feelings. Danielle, by the way, is Cinderella in this version, and is played wonderfully by Drew Barrymore. I liked how she wasn't portrayed as some perfect saint, but was actually able to vent her anger and make mistakes. The love story is also handled expertly, making it clear for viewers how the prince and Danielle grow to care for one another. In the fairy tale it's simply, Oh, we're in love! and that's that. Here we actually get some context that makes the story all the better. The one character I did not like was the Eeeevil bald fellow, because the actor who played him always used this cornball, drippingly slow way of delivering his lines that struck me as being overly villainous. The rest of the supporting cast, however, was a batch of great actors/actresses that really brought the film to life. I especially enjoyed the servants who took care of Danielle and fought for her against the stepmother's wishes. So yes, despite my cynical view beforehand, Ever After turned out to be a pretty neat little movie. Anyone who likes the fairy tale but would like to get a different perspective should see it. 3/4 stars "},{"Title":"I could no sooner choose a favorite star in the heavens...","Date":"7 July 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  A remarkably above-average retelling of the Cinderella fable. I mean that in the sense that EVERYTHING about the film is above-average - nothing too good nor bad. Barrymore's performance as Danielle is very good, but hampered by a silly accent. She nails many of the movie's good lines, though.The production design is good, but not great. Huston's role as a stepmother is wicked, but somewhat unbelievable. The numerous side characters are drawn fairly well, but not THAT well. The dialogue is mostly adequate with a few high points. The music sets the mood, but isn't particularly memorable.It goes on and on...Very enjoyable, and certainly one of Tennant's best. Danielle is a scholar, a farmer, a swordsman, and eventually a princess in this charming film.

The step mother and one step sister are truly evil, and I liked that they kept one step sister kind and compassionate. Leonardo da Vinci was a great character with a couple of humorous scenes (walking on water, Yes, I shall go down in history as the man who opened a door!) and why he was there for some scenes when he would've been inventing something was beyond me, but he was still wonderful.

Director Andy Tennant was at his absolute best when he made this film, but not all the credit should go to him.  The actors play a huge role in the excellence of this movie.  Anjelica Huston who played the evil stepmother Rodmilla showed her colors by making you so angry at how she treats Danielle (Drew Barrymore) that you just want to walk up to the screen and punch her lights out.  Barrymore also plays an excellent Cinderella even thought she may not look like the Cinderella type she plays the part to a T showing her intelligence and poise.  All the actors in this movie were wonderfully selected down to the very last peasant every person fit there part perfectly.  The scenery in this film also played a large part in its beauty. The French countryside is used many times to show the beauty of France. The film features castles, manors, and just the simple countryside the scenery designer did a wonderful job.  But lets not for get the costumes I give a big applause to costume designer Jenny Beavan every costume in this movie were most elegant down to the lowliest peasant I was amazed at how much detail went into each outfit it was amazing.

Too little, and the message becomes muddled and self-contradicting; too much, and it devolves into strident male-bashing.  But when it's right--when the right mix of strength and warmth comes across--the result is a joy to watch.  Such a joy is Ever After, a charming re-working of the Cinderella story.This is definitely not your mother's Cinderella.  The heroine--here called Danielle and played appealingly by Drew Barrymore--is still good-hearted and sweet, but balances this with resourcefulness and courage.  Her masquerade as a noble originates as a selfless one, designed to save a fellow servant from imprisionment.  This is a girl who needs neither a fairy godmother nor an opportunity to waltz with a prince to make herself complete.  Said prince (Dougray Scott), rather than being an impossibly perfect, remote cipher, is a strong presence throughout the film--passionate, determined, a little arrogant, and truly charming.  The stepmother (Anjelica Huston, diving into the role with much relish) is definitely cruel but exhibits flashes of sympathetic behavior; of her daughters, neither is unattractive and only one, the elder, is truly wicked.The film stumbles a bit during the final fifteen to twenty minutes, but there is much here to enjoy.  Barrymore, Scott, and Huston are all entertaining; Melanie Lynsky and Megan Dodds are quite good as the stepsisters.  Richard O'Brien has a well-played but somewhat wedged-in cameo as a lacivious landowner.  The production is beautiful overall, and the end result is a lovely new spin on an oft-told story.

Tragic circumstances occur, but despite the odds Danielle grows up into a strong-willed young woman with tremendous wit and passion that charms the Prince of France (Scott), groomed to be the next king if he ever finds a bride.

Danielle, a self styled champion of the utopian society poses as a noblewoman to free a servant sold into slavery by the Baroness De Barbarac, her stepmother.  Her outspoken nature attracts the immature Prince Henry and as they begin to spend more time together, her views and opinions prove to be the influence Henry needs to face up to his responsibilities as the future king.  Until he finds out who she really is, of course.I will be the first to admit I am a true sucker for this type of old-fashioned, romantic movie. The heroine is industrious and independent, while the hero is charming and handsome and obviously of no use to society without her.  The costumes and locations are beautiful and you just know that no matter how bad things get, there will always be a happy ending. Mind you, this is from the person who still cries when Johnny leaves Baby in Dirty Dancing.  You never know, one day he may not come back for her and she could be stuck in that corner forever.In this film, Drew Barrymore does a credible job as Danielle, although she does seem to flounder a bit with the rather odd accent.  Angelica Huston makes a truly vile wicked stepmother with her own agenda for the Prince's romantic future.  I particularly liked the awful stepsister Marguerite, nice to see the bad girl as a blonde and the heroine a brunette.This is one of those films that does not particular warrant a second viewing, although could be a good choice when you are at the video store and just can't decide, but wanting something reliable.

The story is based on the Cinderella story with a few twists that will make you laugh from the beginning till the end.The first time I heard about the movie, was in the cinema when I was watching the preview. the film looked excellent through the romance and action adventure of the trailer but when I started to watch the real movie, it hit me that it was not what I had expected and longed for. The action is very mild, but the adventure is quite interesting since it involves different historical figures, e.g Leonardo DaVinci. All these can be ignored for the beauty in this movie is the romance.Defying all laws, the prince loves the commoner whom he thinks comes from a noble family. the tragedy in the movie make you cry and the delightful humour will make you laugh and remember even afterwards when you go home and have a cup of coffee.This adventurous romantic comedy drama will make you want to laugh, cry and feel the only greatness that the power of the movies can give you; you will fall in love with Ever After. It is not a regular and boring Cinderella story and it is not a 'chic flick'.

It is a basic premise of drama and acting that if people are speaking to each other in their own language they do not have an accent. However, if a french person is speaking to an Enlish person, for instance, then said French person would speak with an accent.   It is also the basic mistake of american directors etc., who believe that to convey a nationality they must have their actors speak with an accent.

The fairy tale spun into a more reality based life story was done so expertly, it's almost believable!When we hear the Grimms' Brothers talk about the contrived story of Cinderella, the glass/fur slipper, and all the rumors around the story itself, we're intrigued further as how one of her great, great grandaughter's sets the record straight giving us the push we need as an audience to see, even consider how in the world could this ever have taken place?  How are the writers going to pull this one off?!I have to say they did an excellent job!  The storytelling was awesome.  It was written so beautifully that it does give you an entire different appreciation for the Cinderella story.The acting was wonderful.  I liked the fact that although handsome, Dougray Scott wasn't the perfect vision of Prince Charming in all respects.  He had many flaws to his character which made the story realistic.  Drew Barrymore made me laugh and cry as Danielle and Angelica Houston was excellentally cast as the wicked stepmother...even her name sounds wicked, Baroness Rhodmila De Ghent  The two stepsisters were also great.  Marguerite was totally detestable, I mean *really* whereas Jacqueline was sweeter and you got to like her being the least favored of the Baroness' daughters.****Mild Spoilers***** If you haven't seen it.There were so many touching scenes that made this movie memorable.  Two of my favorites (1) The scene when Maurice comes back home after Danielle buys back his freedom and his wife sees him in the distance and they just run to each other.  Beautifully acted and filmed!  It gives us a glimpse into what this story is all about...true love (2) The royal court scene when the Baroness is interrogated by the King and Queen.  The spiciest part of this segment is when Henry calls out to Marguerite and announces his wife.  I just clapped!  Talk about sweet, sweet revenge!Overall this is a wonderful movie!  Don't bother with the accuracy of history or the other little insignificant stuff others have nit-picked about this movie.  It is still just a story.  Beautifully acted, beautifully filmed and written.  Whoever didn't like this must've either been too blind or spaced-out and missed the entire basis of the movie.  It is very much worth your time and money.  If you don't have it on video or DVD, what're you waiting for?  I've watched it about 15 times already!  It's one of those movies you can never tire of watching.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!   "},{"Title":"No profinty?  No Nudity?  No violence?

However, her character is a great role model.  I loved how it focused on female and male issues, but I think it's more of a chick flick.  It's good to see Drew in a film out of the typical Hollywood scene and in a different era.  The storyline was clever how they included quotes from the book Utopia and how Drew's character was tortured by the past and present, but remained fair in the end.  Anjelica Huston played a good role as the step mother and I liked how she was funny, but calculating and had issues of her own to deal with.  The step sisters were also well casted and the dizziness of the youngest sister gave it a light hearted nature.    The fact Barrymore managed to hold her own against such a respected actress (Huston) shows her talent and this film definitely changed her public image.  She has remained cool and modern amongst the young, but appreciated by the adults.  This film shows she has come along way from the drug and alcohol rehabilitation and her B-movie bad girl roles.  However, don't expect perfection.  Barrymore sometimes slips into her American accent and that spoils some scenes, but Huston is consistent throughout.  Also, for viewers who are knowledgeable in history will know that the English version of Utopia wasn't printed when this film was set.  There are some other historical imperfections to name, but it doesn't spoil the charm of the film. Not one for the guys. 9/10.

I was surprised she was able to transform Cinderella into someone with a bit more spunk and charm without making us hate her. Usually there is not much below the surface in a movie like this, but I found Houston's portrayal as the wicked stepmother extremely realistic. It gave the character some humanity without taking away the villainess thrill from her. Also, the two stepsisters were hilarious and perfectly cast. My only problem with the film was Dougray Scott as the prince. He seemed so incredibly shallow and characterless, that I found it a little hard to believe Barrymore's character would fall for him.

The problem is that it comes so close to being great.  The entire movie is the beginning of so many good things.  I liked the idea of telling a contemporary version of the Cinderella story.  I liked the themes of feminism and renaissance and how these fabled characters deal with the ideas.  I liked the initiative to add action and adventure.  I liked the way they made the ugly step sisters beautiful.  I loved the costume and set design when Barrymore enters the ball with wings.  I liked the humour, like when Leonardo da Vinci comes walking across the water.  They needed to develop all of these aspects more fully.I also had a problem with the prince.  Dougray Scott was poorly cast.  He came across as a real dope.  His character was not properly built.  He didn't earn my respect.  And the bottom line is that he's really not good looking and charming enough.  In the beginning he's a rebellious punk, and in the end he's a man with out any fortitude of principle when he rejects her at the ball.  He does of course see the error of his ways but I was not convinced that he would never be fickle again.  And that diaper he wears is far from flattering.Movies like this try to tell women that all men are dorks and that it doesn't matter if they stupidly fall in love with them, because women are strong enough on their own to carry the weight of two.  Barrymore's character seems like she'd be the kind of girl who wouldn't have fallen for Scott's.  She'd look for a guy that can fight along side of her.

Agree with most reviewers above surprisingly good, Barrymore can hold your attention, accent is slightly distracting but I've come to believe not incorrect . . just odd at times. (Shouldn't they be speaking with French accents if they didn't want to do subtitles?)But . . . I want to comment about two or three things that I don't think anybody has mentioned yet 1) The best acting in the movie was done by 3 supporting actors. Megan Dodds as Marguerite De Ghent (really subtly well done), Patrick Godfrey as DaVinci (loved him as Mr Eagar in A Room With a View, Wasn't Rome where we saw the yellow dog?) and Judy Parfitt as the Queen. All of these were fabulous in the little bits of screen time they were given. Personally, I would _love_ to see Ms Dodds in a starring vehicle. Considering that she was probably hired simply to work a visual joke toward the end of the film makes it most astonishing how fabulously she handles her part. That's the second item I wanted to mention, the joke. It involves a painting only briefly shown toward the beginning of the film. The payoff comes near the end, when the step mother and her two daughters are at the door, speaking with King's herald. (a fabulously acted scene by the three women BTW) When Marguerite(Dodds) closes the door, _notice_ how she looks in the door frame. All that's missing is the blue-tinted landscape in the background. What's the next shot? You got it. A blue-tinted landscape. Check it out. Tell me I'm wrong.The one quibble I have with this fun picture, if the King and Queen had been a little more hardened, as would be required of any monarch in the social Darwinism of 16th century Europe, the drama would have been much heightened, because their threats would have been so much more serious.

But try to understand that this is not always a defect. Take as an example The Deep End of the Ocean. It is a beautiful and emotional film, and I really liked it. However, I don't know if I would feel the same thing if I had seen it on the movies. In my view, it would be rather slow and boring. I can say the same thing about Ever After. It is a sweet, charming picture, and I thought it was pretty good. I had a great time watching it on the cable TV, but... somehow it belongs to the small screen. The main reasons for that are its predictability and the 'Sunday-afternoon-matinee' way it was done. Who doesn't know the story of Cinderella? And who doesn't love it? It is one of the most beautiful and known fairy tales of all times, and it enchants children till our days. Director Andy Tennant doesn't dare very much, but somehow he does the right thing. It is a family picture, for all ages, so it is predictable for a reason. And it is done the way I said for the same reason. Ever After was made for people to have fun, and it does this job very well.So if you are not looking for something intellectual, as a Shakespeare adaptation, give a chance to Ever After. It is cute, sweet, fun, romantic and quite touching.

Meet Ever After,  the new and modern Cinderella story. After the death of her father, Danielle de Barbarac, played by Drew Barrymore, is forced into a life of slavery by a cruel and arrogant step-mother, the Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent (Anjelica Huston). She spent her childhood serving her step-mother and her two step sisters- Marguerite (Megan Dodds) and Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey). Despite her social status, Danielle manages to blossom into a strong, intelligent, and happy young woman.  She one day meets her prince charming (Dougray Scott) by accusing him of stealing.  They later fall in love but have to overcome many obstacles such as the barriers between social classes and her sister Marguerite. Although this movie is set hundreds of years ago, it reflects more of our culture than the past.  The major idea that stands out is the feminist movement.  This Cinderella is a bright, independent, young woman with an admirable passion for life.  She shows her courage when she rescues a servant from being shipped to the Americas and when she saved the Prince himself. She has a great love for books and challenging the Prince into arguments of poverty, slavery, and his own responsibilities for his kingdom. Even in the end, instead of the usually Price Charming coming to Danielle's rescue,  she is able to save herself, clearly representing today's ideal woman. The prince recognizes her independence when he says You swim alone, climb rocks, and rescue servants. Is there anything you don't do?The character of the Prince is also a more modern character.  He is rebelling against his parents.  He is in the mist of discovering himself and does not like the fact that his parents have seemed to have decided that for him. This causes him to constantly run away. He wants people to see him for who he is not what he is.  The film also discusses other prejudices among the social classes, how it binds people making it hard for people to be free of these preconceived notions. The fact that a country creates its own poor and should therefore take care of them is also brought up.This definitely one of Drew Barrymore's better performances.  She captivates the screen and inspires us to live life to the fullest. The step-mother also did a good performance.  The other roles were not poorly done, they were just not that difficult to act. Overall I rated the movie with seven out of the ten stars. It was a entertaining mix of humor, romance, and the old mix of good overcoming evil. The acting itself was not bad, but much of the dialect was full of cliches. But one has to keep in mind that this an old fairy tale that has been told many times before.

She does evil so well (refer to The Witches). Anyway, I waited with baited breath for the film to come because I had a feeling it would be great; but I thought it was going to be a Disney production (like what they did with the live-action 101 Dalmatians) and I thought that they were going to make Ms. Huston be the main attraction. When I saw the trailer, I found that what I thought of it wasn't true at all - a title change, Drew Barrymore, and a PG-13 rating - and it only expanded my interest. When I finally saw it, I found that it was one of the best films I ever saw. And I was proved wrong about it being a chick flick - there was more guys in the theatre than girls. Drew Barrymore does the best acting of her career, Anjelica Huston is top notch, and everyone else also turn in exceptional performances. One complaint - why no Oscar nominations?

I was ready and willing to cheer and cry for Danielle (the character played by Barrymore) at any time.  I really felt an air of enchantment around the whole movie.  Then, I saw it again last night on HBO.  I still enjoyed myself, but I noticed flaws, as well.  The air of enchantment was largely gone, and it was more obvious how improbable the story line was.  I should have known that before, but because I was held in thrall the last time I saw it, I didn't notice.  Now, I wasn't held in thrall as much.  I did notice, in addition to the countryside, the sumptuous sets, which hadn't caught my attention as much before.

After all, a remake of a classic fairy tale? And with live actors instead of animation, no less? It would take masterful acting, vivid costuming and scenery, and an incredible story to equal Disney's singing mice, magic pumpkins, and bubbly fairy godmother, but Mirielle Soira's Ever After does just that using only the magic of true love.Drew Barrymore is surprisingly endearing as Danielle, the orphan girl who is forced to become a servant to the only family she's ever known. Anjelica Huston and Megan Dodds are the delightfully wicked Rodmilla and Marguerite de Ghent, the wicked stepmother and stepsister, respectively. But the true surprise of this film is Melanie Lynskey, who plays Jacqueline de Ghent, the other stepsister, and an unexpected ally to Danielle. Dougray Scott delivers a convincing performance as Henry, the first Prince Charming in the history of Cinderella tales to have a name. The supporting cast comes together to create weave an intricate tale that makes you forget it's a film and wonder just how they could have possibly invented cameras in 16th century France.  The true challenge of this movie was, of course, recreating the tale in a way that did not involve animated characters who were two-dimensional in their personality as well as their appearance, easily identifiable as evil or good, all of whom burst into song and dance on the correct cues. The only music you will hear in this film is the brilliant instrumental score and the ending song, the enchanting Put Your Arms Around Me by the group Texas. And even the Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent seems mulitfaceted, as Huston masterfully evokes a bit of sympathy for the villain during a few brief moments. Ever After rose to the many challenges it was presented with by a snarling wolf of an industry that scoffs in the faces of films such as these and says plainly, You will not succeed. But indeed it has. The last line of the film sums it all up, and will leave you with goosebumps on your arms, a lump in your throat, a tear in your eye, and hope in your heart that even in a world full of wicked stepmothers and shattered dreams, magic truly does exist in the hearts of those who love.

It is not perfect but it works on many levels and it thoroughly entertains by taking liberties with the details while sticking closely to the basic plot.The acting is great. Drew Barrymore once again proves that she can breathe life into any character she is given and Angelica Houston is excellent as the wicked step-mother. The rest of the cast also turn in above average performances and each character has a little something to add to the whole.The one thing that is noticeably missing is the magical aspects that make the original a fairy tale. There is no fairy godmother or spells that expire upon the stroke of midnight. The myth has been debunked and we are left with a story that is actually believable. Both the heroes and villians are three dimensional characters; the step-mother is wicked but she also has her reasons for hating Cinderella. The prince is charming but he is also a spoiled brat and a snob at times.Some people may not like the attempt to take the fairy out of the fairy tale but think of how silly it would look to present a fairy godmother in anything other than cartoon form. Also, in a more societal perspective, we are consumed with explaining the myth out of everything. From the formation of Earth to UFO sightings, we are constantly finding rational explanations to reaffirm our perception of the world. What could be more fitting than to explain the story of Cinderella in rational terms that ignore the more fanciful aspects of the children's tale.

I'm a girl, which means I fall for whimsical fairy tale romanticism and a modernised version of Cinderella? - Perfect. However as Drew Barrymore spoke her first lines of dialogue I realised this film was going to be a bitter disappointment due to her appalling English accent which was impossible to ignore or defend for the sake of enjoying such an anticipated movie. This film will be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone who isn't English as the horrendous accents will remain unnoticed, hence the rave reviews by Americans, Canadians, Australians etc.  However it has to be said that since many of the actors/actresses were English, Drew was only cast due to her status as Hollywood Wild Child turned Hip Movie Star to pull in the punters, to excuse an English expression. Without intending to offend Barrymore fans and patriot Americans alike, I can catagorically conclude that this film would have been better if the lead role had been played by an English actress who could have maintained a consistent accent which wouldn't have left me cringing in what should have been the most enjoyable moments of the movie - even though the film was set in France! To any (English)romantics out there who embrace the ideal of a fairy tale romance, don't waste your hard earned cash and rent this film. There are very few scenes which are bearable to watch.

When in the theatres this one definitely suffered from being branded as a chick flick but instead does well to replace all the sticky sap of any Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan movie with a strong-willed, likable lead character.Angelica Houston does quite a nasty turn as a real bitch of a stepmother, and other supporting roles are played admirably. DaVinci was played as it should have been, and wasn't portrayed as the typical crazy coot - cum - genious seen in most of such characterizations (although he was horribly misplaced in time, see below). The French King was a bit too oafish for my tastes.Location filming and costumes were fantastic, and the photography of the film adequate enough to allow for a few postcard sequences. Otherwise, direction was pretty much straightforward.There were some heavy plot holes that distracted from the movie however, namely the lack of reasons that Danielle (Barrymore) was suddenly forced into a life of servitude and the utter disappearance of her royal lineage.Personally, I also had some trouble getting around a few of the anachronisms; the mention of a recent war, the presence of DaVinci, the appearance of the Brothers Grimm, and references to Thomas Moore all in the same movie and time period was well, a bit disturbing.

Teenage boys enjoy too, along with their fathers. This is an excellent modern and believable version of how men can see the beauty in all women.  Drew's character is not the most physically beautiful character, her stepsister is, but the inner beauty is what counts. I find it ironic, that when Danielle looks her worst, and she knows it, is the moment that she gets the wedding proposal. A girl, acknowledged by her neighbor as the true force in the house, has to survive among a strong, dominating woman. Exposed to books by her father, I easily believed that Danielle, an orphan at age 8, loses all social ranking in resonance France. She knows herself to be a servant class, and the penalty of 5 days in the stockade for pretending to be a member of another high social class.  But for the loyalty of a fellow house servant, she takes the risk, and still needs to convince the prince that her task is worthy. The prince is also a believable character, confused, educated by those that lacked a spirit of conviction, in the shadow of a father who is king of all of France. The scenery is wonderful, the clothing adds to the story, and British accents in a French story, oh well, that's what Hollywood has been doing since the first talkies. Just a few loose ends in the story keep this from being my favorite movie. The shoes that are too big, noticed by Leonardo, but never is mentioned again.  The prince referring to Danielle as one of them is puzzling, as I cannot find any previous reference to a them in the movie.I'd like to see the directors cut next, then a sequel. You hear that Fox!?

She was, I believe, 16 the first time I heard her entire story. That admiration has only grown over the last 8 years. But the first thing I thought of when I read the synopsis of Ever After was what a lot of hokum. My friends, who had already seen it and promised me it was great even though they knew I hated the story of Cinderella, forced me, kicking and screaming, into the theater. And I absolutely loved it. Everything about it is magical, even without (thank God) a fairy godmother. That is not to say it's perfect, but its earnest charm won me over. I love the changes they made, like the step-sisters not being ugly and Danielle being smart and free-thinking. This is one movie that everyone seemed to not have good expectations for, yet almost everyone I know of who has seen it loved it. I think that says something. Anybody who didn't like it is certainly free to have their own opinion, of course, but I think they must be crazy. One thing I didn't like was the beginning of the video. (Yes, I ran out and bought it.) The Never Been Kissed trailer is fitting, but what the heck is up with the volunteer pitch? I could overlook that, even if it was odd, because it at least advocated something good. But I'm completely clueless about the Party of Five thing. I had this sudden odd feeling I'd stepped into some slightly off-kilter alternate universe for a second when I was watching it. (Shrug) Probably it was just me. Oh, well.

No, the accents weren't always right, it didn't have awesome special effects, and it's not going to win any awards, but it's good. If you're looking for the usual Cinderella story (The Fairy Godmother, the pumpkin, the magic) you're not going to find it. What you will find is a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. It reminds me (and I've found I'm not alone) of one of my other favorite movies, The Princess Bride It has the same appeal for many different kinds of people. (though not as much guy-appeal as Princess Bride, since there's not long sword-fights) But Ever After is very realistic, compared to both Princess Bride and the usual Cinderella. Like I said, there's no magic, and the relationship between Danielle and Prince Henry develops over time, it's not the silly, unrealistic love-at-first-sight story in the usual version. And Danielle isn't a little wimp everyone can push around. As a teenaged girl I loved that, and I think she's good role model for littler girls used to a very different version of Cinderella. Now for the cast. Drew Barrymore as Danielle is excellent, of course. Dougray Scott is good as a deeper, more complicated Prince than we're used to. Anjelica Huston was the perfect stepmother, showing us a human side for a small part of the movie. Patrick Godfrey was hilarious. Okay, it's not a realistic view of Da Vinci, but that shot for the It looks like rain scene was probably the funniest part of the movie. And I liked Gustave. Maybe I just have a strange fixation with adorable skinny guys, (Matthew Broderick as Phillipe in LadyHawke is another example) but I'd like to see him again.I really liked the fact that while it's a movie adults can like and unmistakably a love story, there's very few swear words and no sex scenes, making it a movie kids will like too. (even if they don't pick up some of the things that are making the older viewers laugh) Bottom line If you like fairy-tale stories that are still believable, especially if you're a fan of The Princess Bride, you'll probably like this movie. Watch it with your kids too, especially your daughters. If you nitpick with details or only like Oscar-level dramas, you might wanna skip it.

A lot of thought and effort seems to have gone into it. The main detraction, to me, was some obvious plot twisting, perhaps caused by the writers wanting both to be original and to be faithful to the original fairy tale. The prolog and the ending are needless and seem tacked on, as none of the actors in those scenes are otherwise in the movie.I know this is a fantasy, but for anyone who is interested in history, Leonardo Di Vinci could not have been present as shown in the story, as he would have been dead for century at least.

When films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan are being raved about as the greatest films ever made, discriminating taste is obviously not part of the mental movie-watching equipment required to get into the theatre.Ever After is simply one of the latest additions to that growing list of subpar, lavishly praised movies. I won't even get into picking apart the plot or the acting. My primary complaint, similar to my beef with Titanic, is how we view, and more importantly - depict, the past through the glasses of our own neuroses and prejudices.In Titanic, the assumption was that for Rose to truly be free, to be human or real, she must spit over the side of the boat and engage in drunken revels, while her fiancee goes to discuss politics over cigars. (get it, ooohh boring!) Her fiancee was not a character, but a caricature, the donkey on which James Cameron could pin the tail so that all those in the audience could squeal. We collectively engaged in trashing the past while we, the more enlightened ones, sat in the theatre congratulating ourselves and willing Rose on to degrade herself in the back seat of a car.Now take Ever After. The Leonardo character was presented as such figures always are in popular cinema a harmless, grandfatherly, eccentric old artist. For eccentric read cute, cuddly, quirky, the Barney the dinosaur element of his soul conquering the Botticelli/Donatello aspect. He wasn't a great man, he just knew how to paint real well. It was the Reader's Digest version of an artist. Emphasize what we have in common with the great souls, what they liked to eat for breakfast. Democratize them, make them harmless.Prince Henry I found even more pathetic. Sorry, I really don't think he had the same need that we do in our industrialist era to make gooey distinctions between who he was and what he did. The line (slight paraphrase?) I want to be loved not for my position, but for who I am almost had me wretching into my popcorn. Come on! I wouldn't want this guy ruling my nation. Maybe I'd let him work in the field, where he could make helmets out of daisies and walk around in those boots that Leonardo made.I realize some of you are saying, Hey, it's a fairy tale! So? Even the serious historical films are doing this. And obviously we're not learning enough history to counterbalance the lessons we're getting from our forms of entertainment. Therefore, everyone who came before was like us, and we are the apex of civilization. So let's all emote together. I'll pass, thank you.

Based loosely on the Cinderella tale, this film with believable characters and no hocus-pocus, brings Drew Barrymore's character 'Danielle' to her prince. Angelica Huston as the wicked stepmother 'Rodmilla' delivers a deliciously sadistic performance, Dougray Scott as 'Prince Henry' is appropriately handsome, and Barrymore is a very pleasant surprise. Ever After has got to be one of her best performances; she is very believable and shows none of the rough edges of some of her other film portrayals, but rather portrays a character who has noble thoughts and feelings and really does care about the people around her. This film is appropriate for all ages, although the younger crowd will no doubt lose some of the clever touches of humor director Andy Tennant put into this film.

The basic story-line is the same except Cinderella's name is really  Danielle (Drew Barrymore), a brave and stubborn young lady.         Danielle's father dies three days after he marries Rodmilla (Anjelica  Houston), Danielle's new stepmother. Rodmilla brings two stepsisters for  Danielle, the beautiful Maguerite (Megan Dodds) who is a meanie, and the  chubby Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey), who's really every nice. Danielle is,  of course, a servant in the household, sleeping by the fireplace and  getting soot all over her. The movie suggests that Danielle only stays with  her stepmother because she wants to be loved for she cannot remember being  loved by her mother. In this movie, the stepmother also really loved  Danielle's father.         Danielle meets Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) when she was picking  apples one morning. He as running away from an arranged marriage with the  Princess of Spain and to do that, he stole the horse that belonged to  Daniell's father. Later, she ran into him again, dressed as a courtier,  trying to save an old servant that Rodmilla sold to pay her debt.They  clicked (well, sort of, if you don't count those temper tantrums that  people who supposedly like eachother have in the movies). They got along  quite well until Rodmilla unmasks Danielle's true status in life at the  ball (or masque, whatever you want to call it).        Drew Barrymore scores a high one as Cinderella, though she can't keep  an English accent to save her life. She can switch quite well from being  sweet to angry and to sad. She makes a very lovely Danielle. Dougray Scott  makes a good hotheaded prince but nothing that people will remember for the  rest of their lives.  Anjelica Houston's portrayal of the stepmother, cold,  evil yet someone in pain over Danielle's father was really great,  especially,the way she raises her eyebrows. Also, the King, was a lovable  dumpling that got a few laughs.        Overall, the movie was a correct version of Cinderella. It was very  sappy and destroyed a few romantic parts (so it's a correct Cinderella,  but it's still a fairy tale!). Since there is such a big fuss over Mulan  being the heroine-not-in-distress, Danielle is definitely summer's second  Mulan.  It's still worth seeing though not worth seeing 5 times (Let's not  turn this into another Titanic!)

It doesn't even fall under the category of a great contemporary romance. However, it does contain a wonderfully nasty and funny performance from Anjelica Huston.Drew Barrymore plays Danielle, the Cinderella of the story. Right off hand I felt the filmmakers could have chosen a better actress. Barrymore is just okay, and never has impressed me very much in her film career (her best performances remain E.T., Mad Love and Riding In Cars With Boys). Also, while she may fall under the Cute department, she is not gorgeous, and I always presumed Cinderella had to be fine. That may sound more like the male ego swarming out of me, but for two hours I'd rather see Denise Richards prancing around in slave rags then Drew Barrymore.But I digress. Danielle's father marries Huston in the beginning of the film, but then suffers a heart attack. Because his last words are to Barrymore and not Huston, Huston turns her into a servant. She will now live to serve and obey Huston and her two daughters. As time passes, we enter their lives and it is here that the humor of the movie is at it's best. Huston is given some very cruel and witty lines to throw at Barrymore when she is serving them breakfast, including Some people read because they cannot think for themselves. And even gets a dis to her own plumper daughter Don't speak unless you can IMPROVE the silence! Hilarious. It is the comedic timing of Huston (and those great eyes) that bring Ever After to a slightly higher level.The whole movie takes place in France, even though everyone walks around speaking in British accents. And since this movie released in 1998, it's given a feminist spin to it- Danielle isn't some gawking idiot, but actually someone who (gasp) loves to read. She also disguises herself as a Countess to help free some slaves that once worked for Huston, and here encounters the Prince. So it's a whole 'Pretend you're wealthy even though you're poor' routine.We all know eventually Danielle will win the Prince's hand, though I rather enjoyed how it's handled- Huston and her 'horrible' daughter are given a great punishment from the King and Queen, and Danielle actually rescues herself from captivity before the Prince asks for her hand in marriage. Along the way we're treated to mushy love scenes between Danielle and the Prince, and then funny parts when Huston comes in (She says How dare you! a lot, but its bearable).

Good chemistry between Barrymore and Scott helps keep the female fans interested in the slowly developed romantic interest, and an appreciation for costumes, settings and photography broadens the appeal for everyone else.But it's by no means perfect. First of all, it can't make up its mind whether it's a modern parable, an old-fashioned love story, a comic soap opera or all of the above. At times the dialog has an anochronistic slant, much too modern to be spoken by characters in period costumes that look authentically medieval.And there are portions of the film that simply sag and stay stifled until some new twist comes along. But evidently young romantics find it the answer to their dreams as long as Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott find their way toward a happy ending, even without a glass slipper. Both young players deserve meatier material but certainly have enough charm to keep the flimsy story entertaining enough.

I guess guys would enjoy looking at Drew Barrymore, who is not at her best quoting Thomas Moore's Utopia, but is otherwise sweet.Angelica Huston has the evil step-mother patented, but this one even turns out to have been a victim of a cold mother herself who could have been saved by her love for Cinderella's father if he'd lived longer. Yeah the Prince is a bit bland, but gosh how many movies have I sat through where the female love interest is all visual and little else (The she was the weakest part of Braveheart for example.) And Barrymore's character shakes the Prince out of bland lethargy into intellectual activism. Interesting that the nasty neighbor with designs on Barrymore actually is the only one who appreciates her spirit; there was a Taming of the Shrew implication there. There's a jarring closing ersatz Celine Dion song at the end co-written by Dave Stewart and sung by the band Texas.

Even the DVD menu design was the style that can amaze me. But the story doesn't seem to go on this way.Suddenly time passed with a simple voice-over, where I suppose a couple of life details of Danielle living with her step family can be cut in, to make the story's background richer and provide more preparation or reasons for the later behaviors of these four women. I always think there must be some jealous or fear in Baronese, whose husband died 2 weeks after she moved into a new land, and barely showed any attaching to her before death, which contributed, in some way, to the twisted step-mother she becomes later. As the details are not told, feeling changes of the step family are not suggested, Danielle's longing to mother-love becomes a bit of a sudden when she expresses it later in the story, though it's yet understandable. Anyway if some incidents early in their life, when Danielle and her step-sisters are young, can be told in the film, which tells the development of their different emotions to each other, the story will be better looking.I have to say the insert of Da Vinci is a pretty design, and when Danielle carries Prince Henry away in front of Gypsies the story becomes very interesting, there're also some thoughts of the screen writer (or maybe director) can be seen there that some philosophy and academic debating will give more sense of history and loyalty to the story as its background is like- The development of Prince's love to Danielle is not yet sufficient, actually that feeling seems come out of no where. I have to say that I was expecting a classic moment or an extremely beautiful shot that pushes the feeling up, but it doesn't appear either. Which makes me feel a bit lost all the way through- are there something missing? To tell how a love story starts there are many ways, sometimes it takes long sometimes it just need one scene of acting, but none has been used here I feel.I watched it again when I saw so many positive comments and I still feel those shortcomings I mentioned above are true, though I do enjoy watching it and I wouldn't mind watching it again; as a girl I think , can always please herself by watching a Cinderella story. ) "}{"Title":"Disney created a better Cinderella than this!","Date":"18 July 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Drew Barrymore plays Cinderella and doesn't play it well.

Anjelica Huston is perfectly fine as the hissably evil stepmother (she's appropriately contemptible without stepping over into camp) and Dougray Scott is the twinkling Prince (with an over-sized codpiece which seems like a sight-gag nobody took note of).

The problem is that well done is not a phrase I would use with regard to Ever After.  I suppose it's an OK movie if you're a 13-year-old girl, but it is an insult to the intelligence of any adult viewer, male or female.The movie is ALMOST worth seeing for the wonderful performances of the radiant Drew Barrymore as Danielle (the Cinderella character) and the deliciously wicked Anjelica Huston as the stepmother, Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent.  (Then again, I saw it on cable and didn't even pay the price of the rental.)  But these fine talents are wasted by an inane script with banal dialogue, characters who are both improbable and trite, and absolutely no sense of historical reality.I understand, of course, that this is not a historical film and is based on a fairy tale.  Yet the filmmakers chose to move it to a concrete setting in 16th Century France, and to introduce such real-life characters as King Francois I and Leonardo da Vinci.  If they do that, they should make at least a minimal effort to strive for some historical accuracy.  Yet the royal couple behaves more like modern upper-middle-class American parents; what we get here is a family with all the glamour of royalty and none of its class prejudices.  There's also a lot of confusion about the heroine's social status.  She is repeatedly described as a commoner, yet her name is Danielle de Barberac; the de is generally a signifier of nobility.  In fact, normally under the laws of that time, if the Baroness had married a commoner, she would have assumed her husband's status and become a commoner herself (and if Danielle was a commoner, so was her father).I don't mind Cinderella being reinvented as feisty, independent or educated.  However, when she is turned into an intellectual, a champion of social justice, AND an amateur athlete and swordwoman all wrapped into one ... well, that's a bit much.*** SPOILERS AHEAD***I can accept the scene where Danielle rescues Prince Henry from the gypsies by hoisting him on her back and walking off (after the gypsy leader promises that she can leave with anything she can carry).  In fact, I don't know if the filmmakers knew this but this scene resembles an allegedly true story from the Middle Ages when a city was under siege by an enemy force, and as part of the terms of surrender, the leader of the enemy forces promised to let all the women leave town, taking away anything they could carry.  The women walked out of the city carrying their husbands on their backs.On the other hand, the scene where Danielle gets away from the evil aristocrat to whom the stepmother has sold her as a slave is simply laughable.  She holds a rapier to his throat, forces him to hand over the key to the shackles he has put on her, and simply walks out of his castle free as a bird.  How ridiculous.  The moment the rapier wasn't at his throat anymore, he would have simply either run after her, tackled her and thrown her to the ground, or called his servants who would have grabbed her.  I guess it was so important to make sure that she wasn't rescued by the prince but rescued herself that reality could fall completely by the wayside.  "},{"Title":"Great Addition to the Fairy Tale Genre","Date":"24 July 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I am usually wary of films based on fairy tales; with the exception of the brilliant animated classics of the Disney studio and the occasional musical (Rodgers and Hammerstein's version of this very story), most of them are boring at best and dreadful at worst. So it was a delightful surprise to experience EVER AFTER A Cinderella STORY, a film that brings a refreshingly feminist sensibility to the main character without violating the fantasy.We all know the story Cinderella (named Danielle here and beautifully played by Drew Barrymore) lives with her nasty stepmother (Angelica Huston, looking like a cobra) and her two stepsisters, Marguerite (Megan Dodds) and Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey). Her father is dead, and her stepmother has relegated her to the status of household servant. Her stepsisters are not equally nasty Marguerite is as bitchy and spoiled as her mother, but Jacqueline is made of softer stuff and tries to make Danielle's life easier, though she isn't strong enough to actually defy her terrifying mother (at least not until the end of the picture).Of course, the core of the film is the romance between Danielle and Prince Henry (Dougray Scott); when they first meet she quotes from Sir Thomas More's UTOPIA, one of the few possessions of her father's that she has left; the prince is not only struck by her beauty, but fascinated that a commoner (and a woman at that, though this is left unsaid) can quote from great literature. Danielle hides her identity from the prince; when he asks her name she gives him the name of her deceased mother.I don't need to go into details. A few plot devices have been added, which is fine because this is the sort of tale that was probably passed on from mother to child in an oral tradition long before anyone put pen to paper. Drew Barrymore's Cinderella is not only breathtakingly lovely, she's fiercely intelligent and possessed of an iron will. Prince Henry is a refreshingly real character; in his first encounter with Danielle he reveals his contempt for commoners and is sharply instructed by Danielle, which does not make him angry but only fascinates him the more. The rest is mostly intact the ball, the Prince's discovery of Danielle's true identity, and his almost-marriage to a most unwilling Spanish princess in what is easily the funniest scene in the whole film.The cast is uniformly magnificent, though the accents are a bit variable. Aside from Huston, Barrymore, and Megan Dodds, all of the principal actors are some form of British (Dougray Scott is Scottish and was trained in Wales and Melanie Lynskey is from New Zealand). Of the Americans in the cast, Megan Dodds pulls off the English accent the best; in fact I was quite surprised to learn she was born in California. Barrymore's accent is adequate; the passion she brings to the role more than makes up for minuscule patterns of speech. Huston's accent is more Upper West Side NY aristocracy than anything else, but again, the actress throws herself into the role with a gusto that makes the rest easy to overlook.Also on hand is one of my favorite English character actresses, Judy Parfitt (DOLORES CLAIBORNE), who plays the Queen of France as a delightfully human woman, who loves her son and wants only the best for him, and also loves her husband enough that she can laugh and tease him, but when necessary she becomes regal, icy, and every inch the Queen, whom one can imagine yelling OFF WITH HIS/HER HEAD!!This sort of film is risky territory, because the tales we remember from childhood often remain vivid in our minds and it's a rare film that can take whatever liberties the writers and director take and still be pleasing. This one is probably one of the best; it is beautifully written, acted, and photographed, the costumes are sumptuous, and the writers cleverly inject enough comic relief to keep the mood light.As romances go this one hits a home run.

Ever After overcomes any objection I might otherwise have had with charm, sweetness, and heart.Effortless direction, sterling performances and a lush score help to breathe life into an old story. But the real star here is the writing. It takes skill to turn such a well-known tale into something fresh and new. The idea of having the visiting Leonardo da Vinci (played to perfection by Patrick Godfrey) serve as the fairy godmother was brilliant, and the denouement, where Huston's evil stepmother is brought low, is wonderfully done.The only possible sour notes in this film are Dougray Scott as a rather flat prince, and Megan Dodds who, as the wicked stepsister was way, way over the top.8/10  "}{"Title":"Whoa, was THIS a surprise!","Date":"31 December 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I had absolutely no intention of watching this film...ever...in my entire life.

That is really all I can think to say.  Nothing in the movie really popped out at me as being great.  The dialogue was good at times, but really lagged most of the time too.  A bird could love a fish, but where would they live?  Come on.  How many times have we heard lines like that?  Usually only in the movies that we all love to make fun of for saying stuff like that (anyone remember the one-liners from Batman and Robin?  shudder).  Anjelica Huston was good in it, but it was far from her best role yet.  This is one of those movies that you hear is good, but you leave the theater wishing that you had gone to see something else instead and just waited for this one to be the HBO Friday Night movie that you watch only when you don't have something else to do that night, so can I please have my money back?

Where Ever After went wrong was that it knew where it was going, and it knew that we knew where it was going, unfortunately it took two hours to get there. It had the potential to be a great film with the supporting cast it had. Drew Barrymore is surprisingly likeable, Anjelica Huston is perfectly hateable. Unfortunately all the characters were stuck in a very formulated plot that didn't stray too far from the original story. There weren't any major surprises, there weren't any new themes presented. Maybe they should have set it in the 90's like the latest Romeo and Juliet, at least then it would have been interesting. All in all, not a terrible movie, just not a very good one.

I supposed that this is inspirited in the Diane (Danielle?) du Pothers life, a cult dame who became the mistress (not the wife who was the famous Catherine of Medicis) of Henri II the Valois, who rule the country with him until his death in 1558. The movies recreates very well  the Renacimiento ages, that includes one of the most prominent figures  Leonardo Da Vinci. But there is too much boring dialogue, Danielle looks too much strong and the historical failures are evident.(for example the Spanish dynasty was a German family so they were thin and blond, not like Cuban refugees, or Thomas More wrote Utopia only five years before Da Vinci Disease, so how Danielle could read that book when she was a child, Queen Mary was Charles the V sister, and was the step mother not the mother of the dauphin, also I can not remember if France have lands in America at that time etc).  I prefer one hounded more time Disney magical and charming movie, thing that here does not appear. However the cast was good. The best performance was made by Angelica Houston, a very versatile actress who needs more important roles. There is also good Dougray Scott as the prince, and in her little moments Melanie Lynskey (the perfidy girl of Heavenly Creatures). Even I still think that Kate Winslet was the best option for the role, Drew Barrymore looks beautiful, and her performance is not bad, more than that  she convinced as the goody heroine, this movie is a kind of lucrative Hollywood redemption to an ex bad girl. I give to this boring  movie a three for their performances and the age reconstrution..

This is a refreshing charm at telling the old children's tale in updated flavor, and it sure is crafty. You knew what went on in Cinderella before, so now this becomes a remake of the events that suddenly turn irreverent. Still, why not be satisfied over something new and improved? The fine acting is what makes this a wholesome delight, even for the high school crowd. Drew Barrymore leads the 90s feminist revolution in what is one of her top performances as Danielle (not Cinderella, although her character is identical). Certainly, her role is a very genuine effort compared to her childhood years and independent movie days. Girls would be cheering for Barrymore in giving her stepsister the black eye, and carrying the handsome prince on back; feminism pays off quite a good sum. Anjelica Huston is also wonderful as the stepmother, and well casted. It's not very harmless except for some intense swordplay and lost clothing from princess Barrymore, but its screenplay follows a vintage classic movie. The highest point is what we all come to know and love a girl meets boy spectacle that leads to (almost) a very different twist of a conclusion. Young children won't get the true meaning of this one, as it is the opposite. Send them a copy of the Disney movie instead. Otherwise, a magically adolescent fairy tale that lives happily ever after. The end.

I mean what is so special about a fairytale when you take out all the fairytale elements? I have to admit, my hopes were not high, but I was most pleasantly surprised. The playing tended to be of a subtle variety, which was good, as most films of this type tend to go for pantomime play-acting.  Angelica Huston, in possibly the role that it is hardest to play subtly - after all she is the film's out and out bad guy - even managed to arouse sympathy for the situation through facial expressions only quite early on. I think having only one wicked step-sister made the film more balanced as to have only the Prince and Danielle herself the good characters would have placed completely the wrong tone, as the nature/nurture debate would have given lie to that situation. Drew Barrymore gave a good solid performance, not breathtakingly good, not astoundingly bad as may have been feared at the beginning, but one that shows she will have a good future as a straight actress. Dougray Scott made a great Prince (slightly wobbly english accent aside), he looked the part and certainly managed to convey emotional depths to the role which is usually sidelined to that of beefcake. I thought the costumes were wonderful, although the ball-gown (and make up) in the pivotal ball scene were too 90's and will date well before the movie itself does. All in all I personally found it to be a most enjoyable experience, and, even though it was not my choice of entertainment for the evening it is something that I would enjoy again.

The story's updating is good and I like the Da Vinci character, but the  whole thing just lacked anything in the way of conflict until the last half  hour.  I felt no compassion for the Prince and was bored for a solid 1 and  1/2 hours.  It needed to decide if it were a serious period tale of a  servant breaking free, or if it was a live-action Disney rehash of it's  successful animated tale; it teetered on the edge of both.  Not for my  taste, but the others I saw it with really liked it.

I am a female and all for feminism and social justice but the way its shown is so unbelievable. Also, if someone in the status of Anjelica's character became a widow, I don't think she would still have been single and raising three children in that period. Also, as someone already mentioned she is shown as a tough, kick-ass girl but spent most of her life never fighting back her family, that i cant really see. Drew does an alright job as Cinderella but ,typical her, she plays the character like a lost, defenseless puppy. Add in the the prince who is played by the miscast Dougray Scott, and you've got one of the worst movie couples. The prince comes off as a boring, one-dimensional, rude, self absorbed idiot. I can only remember chuckling once through the whole movie where the Spanish princess sobbed at the thought of marrying the loser prince. The script is poorly written and the kind of thing only someone 13 and under would really enjoy. Pretty much, save your money and your time and pick ANYTHING else. I would especially recommend The Princess Bride, which has much more wit and humor.

It just proves how provincial the American audience has become and how USA addicted are in the rest of the world. Of course I admit that `Ever After' is not the worst film ever made but there is virtually nothing special about it. Mrs. Barrymore is bleaker than I could ever imagined, the Prince seems too old and serious, the story twist involving Da Vinci seems cheap (though it could have been rather interesting in more talented hands). The only good thing apart from rather nice costumes is Anjelica Houston.
