[{"Title":"Riveting performances and a thought-provoking story. One of the best movies of the year. **** (out of four)","Date":"27 December 2000","Score":"48 out of 70 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  THE CONTENDER / (2000) **** (out of four) 	After our recent presidential conflicts, Rod Lurie's political drama, The Contender is of the most timely and uncommonly absorbing movies this year, even though we may be sick and tired of politics. The film examines political figures and their stand of such controversial issues like abortion, infidelities, and even Clinton's impeachment trial, making this production feel real, as if a behind the scenes look at a sex scandal in Washington DC because it is so well written and portrayed. Interlaced with much thought-provoking material and Academy Award worthy performances, The Contender is one of the best pictures of the year. 	As the film opens, the country's vice president has recently died, leaving Democratic President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges), who is near the end of his final term, choosing a vice president for replacement. Although he recently bared his courage in a failed attempt to save a woman from drowning, Governor Jack Hathaway (William L. Peterson) is turned down by President Evens. Instead, Evens wants to leave a legacy by selecting a woman as vice president, thus chooses a Senator who currently shifted from the Republican party to the Democratic party, Laine Hanson (Joan Allen). The Republican confirmation committee chairman, Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), thinks Evans' choice to be self-dignified and inaccurate, and desires Hathaway to take the place of the vice president. 	The Contender begins on a strong note, only displaying the necessary events. We do not witness the death of the original vice-president because it is not important. We do get to see the heroic action of Governor Hathaway, however, squarely because this event, concluding with a shocking twist, plays a vital role in the movie at a later time. Through brilliant directing and editing, the story provides an increasing amount of tension within the characters, especially the Joan Allen and Jeff Bridges characters.	In a cruel attempt to prove the insecurities of the vice-presidential candidate, Runyon uncovers information that places Hanson's morality in question. The situation is whether or not she participated in public sex with two men (at the same time) while 19 years of age in college. The information is leaked to the press, while Runyon uses the discussion to bring the subject in the hearings. What I say the American people will believe. And do you know why? Because I will have a very big microphone in front of me, states Runyon. The democrats are extremely weary over this case because 1) they know Runyon's statement is true and 2) Hanson refuses to acknowledge anything regarding her alleged sexual adventures. Even so, the president supports his candidate.	The movie succeeds with its accurate and involving performances. Joan Allen is Award material in a performance that is tense, taut, and engaging. Christian Slater is frantic and energetic as a novice reporter. Jeff Bridges is entirely convincing as the President of the United States. His prestige is convincing and he exhibits a powerful, detailed attitude, resulting in a superb performance. Gary Oldman is perfect with a sly, cunningly cocky and self-confident performance that fits his character extremely well; there is a very real possbility his work will be remembered come Academy Award time.	 The Contender succeeds to a high degree because it makes us to examine our own beliefs and possible reactions to such a pragmatic issue;  would we, as individuals, want a vice-president who is a sleaze ball, or as a character puts it with a mouth full of c*ck. What makes the film even more extraordinarily enthralling is that it never until the end reveals whether Laine actually did participate in the immoral acts. This is a very thought-provoking story, full of surprising twists and a meaningful message.

But do we need to be reminded of that fact?  The answer to that is, inarguably, yes; just as we must be reminded of the Holocaust lest we forget and allow history to repeat itself, we have to at least keep somewhat abreast of anything which so significantly affects our lives.  And unfortunately (some would say), politics is one of those things, and whether we approach it actively or view it all with passive ambiguity, the fact remains that what happens in government affects us all in one way or another on a daily basis.  `The Contender,' written and directed by Rod Lurie, is a serious and sensitive examination of the political machinations employed to effect power and control within a democracy.  In Lurie's scenario, the position of Vice President of The United States has been open for three weeks and must be filled.  President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) makes his choice  Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), who would be the first woman in history to hold the position.  First, however, she must be confirmed.  And at this point, the real story begins to unfold as the beast rears it's head  Enter partisanism, personal agendas, media manipulation and, somewhere near the bottom of the list, Truth.   	To illustrate this dirtiest of all businesses, Lurie references a specific episode from the not-too-distant past, and draws a number of parallels to more recent political events, all of which are used purposefully and effect the desired results.  It becomes not so much a case of good against evil so much as simply a question of what is right and what is wrong, who draws the line and who decides when and where that line  should be crossed.  To his credit, Lurie objectively presents both sides of the story without delving so deep as to mire the proceedings down with any unnecessary baggage merely to introduce any subjective leanings or to manipulate the audience one way or another.  It's like a political campaign; viewers are left to decide for themselves and cast their vote as they may.   	The theme of the story itself is not virgin territory, but the way it's handled and delivered, including some exceptionally strong performances (there should be some Oscar nominations here), makes it unique.  Joan Allen adds another exemplary performance to her resume, further demonstrating her great prowess as an actress.  She imbues Laine Hanson with a strength and character that makes her entirely believable and credible.  And Gary Oldman (in what is an uncharacteristic role for him) is absolutely dynamic as the ultra-conservative Shelly Runyon, who proves to be a most formidable opponent to Hanson and Evans.  Bridges also comports himself well, creating a strong, insightful character in President Evans, exhibiting the very private, human qualities behind the public figure.  The excellent supporting cast includes Christian Slater (Reginald Webster), Sam Elliott (Kermit), William Petersen (Hathaway), Philip Baker Hall (Oscar), Mike Binder (Lewis), Robin Thomas (William Hanson) and Saul Rubinek (Jerry).  Lurie allows only a single lapse into melodrama (patriotic music begins to swell about half-way through Hanson's final speech), but the closing speech by President Evans is impeccably delivered with force and strength, and his words are exhilarating; how satisfying it is to hear things said that must and should be said, if only in the movies.  Using the political arena to address subjects that concern all of us&#150; morality, ethics, principles, truth and honesty&#150; `The Contender' is riveting drama that invokes the conscience of a nation by examining the moral fiber and motives of those who would aspire to greatness.  It's gripping entertainment with a message about Truth, Decency and the necessity of bipartisanism in politics; it's a statement well made, and one that should be taken to heart by all.  I rate this one 9/10.

Gone are the days of Advise and Consent, when the opposing parties were simply referred to as the majority and minority, and the movie aimed at non-partisan neutrality . Here, the administration is Democrat, and the film proudly wears its liberal heart on its sleeve. And the movie is all the better for this clarity and honesty.Jeff Bridges is well cast as Jackson Evans, a President every bit as charismatic and opportunistic as Bill Clinton. Indeed, the whole movie can be seen as a take on the Monica Lewinsky saga, highlighting the manipulation and hypocrisy displayed on all sides at that time. (One mistake in the script is a direct reference to the Clinton impeachment vote; it is dangerous for parodies or satires to refer to the true stories on which they are based - it leads to a dislocation in the audience's point of view, and in this case to the awkward question - if this is a post-Clinton Democrat President, and he's coming to the end of his second term, in just what year is the action supposed to be taking place?!)Given the White House shenanigans in recent years, it is surprising that some IMDb commenters should question the plausibility of the plot, which I feel stretches our credulity no further than most Hollywood thrillers. Joan Allen as vice-Presidential nominee Laine Hanson, and Gary Oldman as Shelly Runyon, her would-be character assassin, have strong parts and make the most of them - though personally I think it is Bridges' movie - but there is perhaps a little too much of Christian Slater in a curious role as Reginald Webster, a young, liberal, but seemingly anti-feminist, Democrat Congressman. The director, Rod Lurie, seems unable to make up his mind whether Webster should be portrayed as an overly-naive idealist, or an ambitious cynic with his eye on the main chance. Overall, this is a fast-moving, enjoyable film, making the points that petty personal indiscretions should have little influence when it comes to power politics, and that it's about time the USA had a woman as President or at least a heart beat away.

Like several other political films, it is too gutless to follow through on what is potentially a terrific premise.*****SPOILERS AHEAD******So Laine comes under fire for possibly having participated in an orgy. The point of the film, which is hammered home so relentlessly that one tires of it, is that she shouldn't have to answer questions about her private life. However, she is forced at the end of the film to answer to us, and to tell both us and the President what actually happened and it turns out that she didn't participate in the orgy. The internal logic of the film dictates that we should admire her for the moral stance she is taking now, and respect her privacy and her integrity even if she did participate; but the filmmakers were too cowardly to think that the viewers might find admirable a character who had actually participated in her youth, and they thereby completely undermine the point they were trying to make. Secondly, the fact that she betrayed her best friend by sleeping with her husband is brushed lightly aside in the film, with the comment that she was just being human. I'm sorry, but I'm much more inclined to condemn someone for betraying their friend and sleeping with their husband than for being promiscuous when they and their sexual partners were both free.The filmmakers were also not brave enough to make the main Republican figures remotely likeable. They should have depicted them as fighting for what they thought was right in order to make a proper film, instead of the shallow and sanctimonious tosh they are inflicting on the public.

Why? Well the acting is tremendous, let's just get that out of the way right off the bat. Joan Allen and Jeff Bridges are very deserving of their Oscar nominations. However the movie fails because it uses these great actors in what ultimately turns out to be a decent, yet mediocre movie. There was certainly nothing tremendous, or unique about this story. We have seen this all before with our previous president. Sex scandals are condemning, but not enough to keep someone from getting to the position that they want to get to (and keep in mind, they never disclosed to the public that the incident never happened, so in the public's mind, the Allen character was...well guilty for lack of a better word). In fact our past President's story is much more riveting because he was the President when the scandal happened, and it happened in the White House. Now I know this movie tries to put a different spin on this issue by using a woman as the character caught in an alleged sex scandal, and suggesting that because it is a woman it is different. In other words a woman would never get a way with this kind of scandal and a man would. However, if they wanted to feed off of that different spin then they should have provided different results from what occurred in the Clinton scandal. Instead the same results were exhibited. The Democrats said who cares, and the Republicans said hang her. If they wanted to make it so different then everyone would have wanted her out of the picture, period. This movie also got a little caught up in the Democrat good, Republican bad idea. If the story could have been a little more objective, then it would have been a little more powerful. And one more thing, I don't care if it is a woman, a man, a Democrat, or a Republican. If you put someone in the position that the Joan Allen character was in, and they publicly admitted that they did not believe in God, then they would not get confirmed. The bottom line is 90-95% of Americans believe in some sort of higher deity, and they would not want an atheist second-in-command. Overall, a missed the mark movie that could have been so much more. But like I have said before, that's just my opinion.

The first half was dramatic, compelling, believeable, and character-driven. The 2nd half degenerated into the tawdriest and most unbelieveable sort of political propagandizing imagineable. It's hard to believe, in fact, that the person who wrote the first half of this movie also wrote the 2nd half.The first half of this movie is very human...a story about people in politics, being tested by morally ambiguous circumstances. Their actual politics, while clearly laid out, are secondary. Moviemakers used to wisely recognize the folly of imposing their own political views on their audience, and made sure that political expressions were limited to those that were fairly universally accepted--truth, honesty, and so forth. Remember Mr. Smith Goes to Washington? The Contender, however, goes out of its way to do the exact opposite.Near the beginning of the movie,Laine Hanson (an ubelieveably saintly Republican-turned-Democrat) is speaking to her father, a retired Republican Governor, whom the filmmakers gratuitously have chide his grandchild for his kindergarten teacher's having mentioned Jesus in the classroom. Teachers are there to teach, not preach, and he denounces her remark about Jesus as superstition--quite beside anything remotely pertinent to the story. His remark, though, is pointed, his attitude is bizarrely sneering for what the writers clearly hope to pass off as an aside. The movie gets much worse, though. Later, during what is supposed to be a rousing and morally superior closing statement before the Senate Confirmation Committee that has been questioning her moral suitability, she proudly declares herself to be an atheist who worships in the chapel of democracy. During the same speech, she declares that she wants to remove every gun from every household, that she supports a woman's sacred right to choose, and so on and so forth. Standard political boilerplate. (Curiously, she states at one point that she left the Republican party when they moved away from the values she espouses. I wonder...when has the Republican party EVER espoused gun banning, abortion, abolition of the death penalty, or any of the causes for which Laine now so zealously crusades? Are the filmmakers trying to make her seem thoughtful and fairminded in her zeal? Come on!)Okay, so what's wrong with this? She's a politician expressing political ideals? First of all, the speech is hoaky as can be, with music clearly meant to raise us to a pitch of (left-wing) patriotism...the effect, though is embarrassing. I was uncomfortable for Joan Allen having to recite such awful lines. Second, she's is supposed to be a moderate Democrat...yet all the views she expresses extremely left-wing. Even Republicans in this movie espouse leftist ideology (like her father). The one person who expresses a conservative viewpoint is Gary Oldman's character, a political hardball player who during the confirmation hearings is given to snarling at this poor woman for supporting a holocause of unborn babies. The cliches are fast and furious. To show, however, that Runyon (Oldman's character) is--or WAS-- a good man, the writers trot out his haggard wife and have her remind him of the time he stood for something good...the time he stood up for hate crime legislation! Amazing. Third, the filmmakers take all this silly rhetoric as seriously as Laine Hanson does! In fact, if this movie's failure can be summed up, it is probably that the moviemakers are as gravely serious about the protagonist's trenchant ideology as she is. The term for this is Authorial Intrusion. The moviemakers committ is, big time.The problem with this movie is not that it favors liberal ideology, of course. It's that it favors ANY ideology. You cannot promote any agenda as brazenly and aggressively as this movie does, and not have it throw the whole movie off kilter...like a shopping cart with a bad wheel. The ending of this movie--which I will not divulge--is improbably beyond belief. This movie has been billed as a political thriller. It isn't. It's a hybrid between a cheesy soap opera, and a propaganda film. Gary Oldman and Joan Allen deliver great performances, though, and if this movie is worth seeing at all, it is just to see two great actors practicing their craft.

Director Rod Lurie is living my fantasy.  After a career as a movie critic, he is now directing some of Hollywood's best (and under-utilized) actors and actresses.  This little thriller is fun to watch thanks mostly to the skills of those on the screen.  All of these actors should work more ... SHARE your talent.  Jeff Bridges is a very pompous, yet charming, smooth talking president.  I assume the list to play the president was short, thanks to a couple of script lines about Clinton.  Joan Allen is excellent as the cool senator with the lurid past (?) who is nominated for the VP slot.  Gary Oldman, who continues to reinvent the role of CREEP, steals every scene he is in.  Of course, this happens in all of his movies!  It is always nice to see Sam Elliott and William Petersen on screen.  And I guess Christian Slater is trying to salvage a career after the disastrous Very Bad Things.  He has lost some smugness and tempered his Jack Nicholson dialect.  My only disappointment with the movie was in the script.  Although I love the subject matter and the issues raised, I kept waiting for the shoe to drop on Gary Oldman's charater's deep, dark secret.  Jeff Bridges stifling his political career seem quite the letdown.  Would have really enjoyed a few more plot twists to really test the audience and cast.  My tidbit for this one comes from the career of Sam Elliott.  Next time you are watching Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, check out a young Sam Elliott in the early card playing scene.  Also, William Petersen's power-hungry wife in The Contender is played by Kristen Shaw, a carry-over from Rod Lurie's film, Deterrence.

Although I intensely appreciated this movie, I do not believe this could have been an oscar-winning film because the truths it expresses with regards to the presence of women in high ranking political positions far outway its acting and directing talents, with the possible exception of Gary Oldman's role as Shelly Runyon, who was frighteningly convincing at being an absolutely awful man. I enjoyed this movie because of its intention to show what women in politics really face. The strength displayed by Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) while up for vice president is nothing short of inspirational. Gary Oldman's character provides us with a good idea of how manipulative and ruthless people can be when in a position of power and, ironically, when they have been put in a position to judge another's morality. This film seems so realistic that we tend to forget it's a movie. It makes us question, why does a person have to be surrounded by such controversy and be forced to take on such a defensive position, simply for being a woman? What I appreciated is the refusal of Hanson to succomb to the pressure of taking that defensive position, regardless of the truth. Of course, the other refreshing aspect in this movie is Jeff Bridges' role as an ideal president.All in all, it is a long overdue account of reality, with great character development but not recommended for those with short attention spans, as it is dialogue, and lots of it.

So the hearings go afoul.What makes this click is the writing. It's sharp, surprisingly astute, and sometimes scary for its believable bitterness. Now this doesn't necessarily make this a commanding movie &#x97;there are endless inner sanctum meetings and one-on-one power plays&#x97;but if you like this kind of thing, it's impressive enough to stick it out. It's an irony that the ostensible main character, the woman in line to be VP, is relatively weak, played by Joan Allen. (Imagine a real politician, like Hilary or Barbara Boxer in the role instead.) She has all the right lines but she lacks a sense of power that she surely would have if about to be number 2. Around her are powerful men, including two actors who are really strong&#x97;Gary Oldman as an opposing Republican and Jeff Bridges as the President. So the swirling conversations around these issues are driven and pointed. It's good stuff. The writer, Rod Lurie, happens to also be the director, and he does a creditable if not masterful job.One of the flaws here is the basic premise that this woman would have had such scandal (in political terms) and gotten as far as senator. There are photographs of the one event (the details shift as the plots goes on, however) and television footage implying her affair. These are made plain and obvious beyond normal norms to make a point&#x97;the women are held to a different standard than men. But I'm not sure&#x97;if there were supposed photographs of a man having a wild sex romp as a college kid, they would probably derail the man's career as well. I'm not saying they should&#x97;not for a man or a woman&#x97;but that's the reality.Anyway, the issues are given a fair shake and an uneven treatment with great perception.

He had me questioning, really, is there such a thing as a shark steak sandwich, something I'd feel reluctant to eat, as Slater.

You can't criticize one party without being accused of being with the other, even though you don't like either.  Nevertheless, here goes.The Contender is an extremely pro-Democrat and Pro-left movie that has more than a few similarities to ex-President Clinton and his scandals, and makes me wonder how deep the connection between Hollywood and the Democrats goes.The plot is more or less about a woman (Laine Hanson) being nominated for vice-president and the resultant cat fight that follows.  We have all the usual stereotypes; Laine (Joan Allen) is a former Republican who saw the light and joined the good side.  (People like that always come up in droves around election time.)  She doesn't seem like anyone who could ever have been part of the right, especially when she's prompted about her beliefs and rattles off the extreme left mantra blow by blow.  She's also very virile, as the opening scene is of her doing the nasty with her husband in her office.At the other end we have Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) who is the evil Republican who dogs her nomination with sex scandals as he wants to see his candidate get nominated. (William Petersen in a subdued role.)    Runyon is balding and homely, eats red meat as we see in several scenes (everyone else eats healthy of course) and we see him morosely sitting around his dimly lit kitchen contemplating what's become of his sterile life.  They might as well had a banner running across the bottom of the screen saying See what happens when you're not a Democrat?The sex scandal involves a wild orgy Joan Allen supposedly was the center of in college.  (Very had to picture in that.)  Joan simply refuses to talk about it because it no one's business, and the entire drama revolves around that.  The side interest is William Petersen who seems cut out to be the vice president, even having heroically tried to save a woman's life in a car accident.  We also get to see Jeff Bridges playing the president, as a political bully who revels in whatever food he can order in the White House, and reminds one an awful lot of Clinton.Anyhoo tooth and nails fly, The President does the impossible and calls both houses of congress to demand a a vote, and banishes the evil Republican---er, Runyon.  It's all for our daughters, yada, yada.  Trouble is the movie chickens out before it ends.  William Petersen is written off as having paid the woman to let him rescue her, and it turns out Joan Allen was really a good girl, just a case of mistaken identity, but it wasn't your business in the first place.  The Contender flops where it could have tried to say something.Ultimately it's hard to see this movie as anything more than an attempt to whitewash Clinton and tout the Democrats, I found the intrigue about as interesting as watching C-Span.  What does make me mad is the idea that we should just ignore or excuse what we may hear about our political leaders and only focus on whatever the talking head says.  (Play Joan's what I stand for speech a few times over to see what I mean.) Politics is ultimately a mind game to achieve the social king of the hill, nothing is for real or what is seems.  Seeing how these people act behind the mask, when they don't think a camera is around, is about the only way we know what our political leaders really are.  The Contender contends however, that we not only shouldn't ask about our leaders, but have no right to do so.

So good that the rest of the cast almost performs at the Gary Oldman level. That's high praise,indeed.With that out of the way,it seems like the real purpose of this movie was to take a cheap shot at Republicans in general,and conservatives in particular. The Dims are saints,and the Republicans are evil.This message couldn't be clearer than when Joan Allen gave her little speech about I'm for a woman's choice,I'm for the government taking the guns out every house in the country,etc,etc,etc.,and the speech she made about leaving the Republican Party because it had shifted away from the values that formed this country. That had nothing to do with movie making,and everything to do with political propaganda. Stalin couldn't have came up with a more left-wing rant.After all,how can you take a movie seriously when it shows a vice- presidential candidate giving a speech to a committee that states she wants to see every gun in the country confiscated by the government? We are supposed to believe the voters would take a direct assault on the Bill of Rights so casually they would elect someone who said that?It's a damn shame the director and writers of this movie decided it was more important to make a propaganda film than a movie for entertainment.Not that the Republicans aren't guilty of sleaze. They most certainly are. They are mere amateurs compared to the Dims,though. As the writing,editing,and directing in this movie proves.

On first viewing I remember not wanting it to end; I was already fully hooked by all the characters. Jeff Bridges makes a great president and Gary Oldman makes a great bad guy.Some people may criticize the movie for being too literal Democrat=good, Republican=bad. That's fair, but as Roger Ebert observed It's refreshing to see a movie use real political parties rather than being more ambiguous. For the slightly preachy tone (and swelling strings during the climactic scene) and for the slightly hard-to-believe opening sequence in which William Petersen's politician character hires a woman to drive off a bridge so that he can save her and look heroic, I took off one star. Apart from those flaws, this film is aces. "},{"Title":"The Contender started off as one of the most well-balanced political movies I've ever seen","Date":"12 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" How refreshing it was to watch the first three-quarters of The Contender and see a film that was perfectly well balanced. Conservatives see a film about a righteous Congressman (Gary Oldman) standing up for his beliefs and blocking an affirmative action Vice-President at the expense of more qualified candidates. Liberals see a film about a brave Senator (Joan Allen) who cops abuse about her personal life during a confirmation hearing and refuses to engage because its none of their business and a man would never be subject to such treatment.Rod Lurie's film is obviously inspired in parts by Aaron Sorkin's then The West Wing, which had just debuted to critical acclaim. As a director, he has his moments but fails in his attempts to emulate the walk-and-talk mastered by Thomas Schlamme. Camera movements are clunky and cuts become necessary, but they are hugely obvious and distracting. During one scene, the camera moves from foot level to focus on Sam Elliott's face, but halfway up it stops and fixates on his chest for several seconds. It looks like someone dropped the camera, caught it midair and then kept going. As a writer, Lurie displays eloquence that Sorkin himself would admire, especially in a bold Presidential address late in the film. His dialogue is sharp and the political games played by the characters is believable and exciting to watch (see especially the final twist). Unlike Sorkin's The American President, Lurie refrains from liberal bias and depicts both sides fairly. Even during a scene in which Oldman and Allen face off over whether abortion is murder or the woman's right to choose, both sides are depicted fairly.Unfortunately, there are a number of scenes where the film skews heavily to the left. One of the worst offenders is a scene in which Allen's 6 year old son proclaims to his grandfather that a certain tennis move came from baby Jesus, because baby Jesus made everything, allowing the characters to openly badmouth the influence of church on education. As someone who actually attended a Christian school and was turned off by religion soon after, I found this scene insultingly stupid and simplistic. Allegedly, studio execs including Steven Spielberg skewed the film to depict liberals more favourably, which angered non-political Gary Oldman, who is ultimately depicted as a villain. Up until the final act (and even during parts of it) Oldman's character is one that the President respects even if he doesn't personally agree. His public humiliation is done for political reasons, not personal. However, the final scene has Oldman slink away in defeat while President Jeff Bridges hollers about the high ground. The exact same scene could have played out with minor variations, as Oldman leaves in protest of the President's ability to nominate Allen's character rather than slinking away like a beaten Disney villain.The acting in this film is excellent. Joan Allen is very subtle as she plays her cards close to the chest. At times I thought her to be a very naive character and she was the victim of bad writing, but when she boldly tells the President why she did not deny the story when she had every ability to, I sat back in admiration despite myself. Gary Oldman is terrific and perhaps one of the few Republicans fairly depicted in film. Jeff Bridges and Sam Elliott cut imposing figures as the President and Chief of Staff, and carry dramatic and powerful moments thanks to their booming voices and commanding presences.My biggest problem with The Contender is the subplot of Governor Hathaway. It starts well and ends better, but the whole premise of the film is that Bridges wants him but can't have him because Republicans won't forgive him for not saving a girl from drowning (another liberal bias which is insulting to intelligence). However, Oldman quickly snaps Hathaway up as the preferred candidate. When you are facing a smooth confirmation for your best candidate, any President would've seized that opportunity with both hands, glass ceilings be damned. It may be only a small plot hole, but its the plot point that sets up the entire film, so it needs to be addressed.

She is now married and has a son. The current President wants to make history by appointing a female in position of committee chairman. Terrific setup flawed only with a conventional ending. Directed by Rod Lurie who establishes the political aspects with arguments from either side. Allen is strong as Hanson who knows her faults and holds her own despite accusing opposition. Gary Oldman steals scenes as the sabotaging Shelley Runyon. His performance is so effective that it is perhaps the best element of the film. Jeff Bridges plays the President who seems to be constantly eating. He meets with Hanson and at least hears her story while others point their blame. Christian Slater plays a young columnist who wishes to fill a space on the committee. William Petersen plays President Hathway who fails to save a life in the film's opening sequence, and it becomes an unfavored focus of attention. Great theme of gender threat that highlights film.

Joan Allen plays a U.S. Senator who is chosen by the President (Jeff Bridges) to replace his deceased Vice President. At first, she seems the perfect choice, but the opposition (the Republicans, led by Gary Oldman - and, no, it's not kind to them, as one might imagine of a political film that appeared at the end of the Clinton era), while digging up her skeletons, happens upon a dark secret as a freshman in college, she participated in an orgy, and there are both photographs and witnesses. Her party scrambles and begs her to deny the charges (which, of course, are in no way illegal), but Allen sticks to her principles and insists that her sexual past is no one's business. Allen is stellar, of course, but Bridges really steals the show as an uber-savvy politician who can be kind of slimy one moment and a great head of state the next. Both were nominated for Oscars. It's also fun to have Sam Elliot there as Bridges' adviser just two years after The Big Lebowski.

No matter how many times I watch this movie I am still mesmerized by Rod Lurie's spellbinding script and brilliant directing. Lurie brought out the best in his cast, Joan Allen was great but it was Gary Oldman's depiction of the complex and enigmatic Shelly Runyon that was truly masterly. Even classics like All the President's Men are eclipsed by this movie. When making comparison's I suppose one must also consider Otto Preminger's 1962 effort Advise and Consent, a movie not even discussed in The Contender's bonus materials. Despite a remarkable cast and a heralded director, Advise & Consent, alas, deserves the relative obscurity it enjoys today, (it bombed in 1962) I had trouble staying awake through the turgid performance of an ailing Charles Laughton. Political dramas are not easy to pull off, cinema audiences are much more savvy and sophisticated today. Mr Smith Goes to Washington seems so naive it's hard to believe even 1939 audiences bought it. As far as The Contender's realism is concerned, wouldn't it be great to hear the opinions of Washington insiders like Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin and Condoleezza Rice? assuming they took time out to watch this movie. One thing I just can't get my head around is why such a brilliant filmmaker as Rod Lurie would waste his talent on a remake of Straw Dogs. Unbelievable! "},{"Title":"An Involving Political Drama","Date":"2 May 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" There are two vice presidential contenders in The Contender Senators Jack Hathaway (William Petersen) and Laine Henson (Joan Allen). The first time we meet Hathaway, we see him attempting to save the life of a woman whose car flies off a bridge and into a nastily cold river. She is killed in the accident, but Hathaway, who was fishing nearby, is heavily publicized as a hero who risked his own well-being for a mere stranger. The introduction of Henson catches her and her husband in the middle of a sexy exchange, with C-SPAN playing in the background. With no other knowledge to your disposal, who would you pick as your next vice president a hero, or a person that uses C-SPAN as sexy-time music?The Contender grapples with the idea of a sex scandal taking down a respected politician; in the process, no stone is left unturned. While not necessarily a political thriller, the film feels like a thriller because the endless revelations and discoveries are just as exciting as governmentally-based conspiracies. In the political thriller genre, there is a tendency to snatch a real-life event and see how it will turn out on the big screen, and when the story is fictional, you can only sit back and attempt to count the parallels.The Contender comes a few years after the whole Clinton/Lewinsky ordeal &#x97; even today, it's as if more people are aware of Clinton's despicable infidelities than fiascos like Watergate. Why? The population is obsessed with sex, and if a national figure is making whoopee with the wrong person at the wrong time at the wrong place, you can forget about the last politically based issue; private matters are so much more interesting. Take only one look at Laine Henson, and you'll see an intimidating senator that is likely to be the smartest person in the room. But when you do your research, prepare to be surprised at what you find &#x97; when she was a freshman in college, Henson allegedly participated in a filthy orgy in order to land a spot in a sorority. In most cases, this type of story would appear on the cover of the latest National Enquirer, disregarded by everybody and everything. But veteran power broker Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) is the one who leaked the disreputable details; he's severely bitter, as he wanted Hathaway to get the job and is resentful towards Henson's decision to transition from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party early in her career. In return, Henson is placed into numbing public scrutiny, tainting her chances of becoming the president's newfound right-hand man.Enlisting gender inequality, biased attitudes, and party prejudices to back itself up, The Contender is a hard-hitter because it is nearly impossible to disregard. The exact same situation could make headlines tomorrow, for all we know. Certainly, if a respected female politician were to face the same allegations as Henson, things wouldn't be much different. It's likely that there is a Shelly Runyon constantly lurking in the shadows, digging up some serious dirt in order to satisfy their own dying insides, and it's likely that if a man were in an identical position, there would not be as much hatefulness in store. The film unravels with the kick of a sneak attack, mounting and mounting until it knocks us out when we least expect it; the writing is pointed, as sensational as it needs to be.Without a doubt, The Contender wouldn't work without the interplay between Allen and Bridges, two of our generation's best actors giving what can only be described as career best performances. Allen's no- nonsense approach is thoroughly convincing; even in moments when most actresses would take the opportunity to let the emotions of their character spin them into a melodramatic tizzy, Allen stays true to the iron-willed personality of the admirable Henson. Bridges, able to disappear into any role he is given, has the amiable likability of any president we've elected over the years. The Contender is packed full of so many excellent performances and so much astute writing that it is surely one of the best political thrillers of the 2000s. The last few minutes, which turn the film into a celluloid The West Wing, are damaging but easily forgivable, however out of place they are. "},{"Title":"Excellent Performances, Good Script","Date":"11 July 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" I agree with Mr. Oldman's views that his character and his associates was edited into venal cardboard cut-outs to suit the political views or predilections of the producers or executive producers and to the detriment of the story. The opposition to President Jackson's nomination of Laine Hanson could have been so much better if the director and editors let the opposition characters be three dimensional people with differing viewpoints that were as passionate in their beliefs as the President and Vice-Presidential nominees.The political and moral issues of this story are current and spot on, but could have been developed more evenly. The conflict was unbalanced by the simple and purely venal portrayal of the opposition. This would have strengthened the denouement of President Jackson's final speech.I liked the movie and it's drama, but I don't think it delved into the ethics and the morality at the center of the issue of the confirmation investigation and hearings. It should had been discussed. That is one of the problems of current Washington, D.C. where taking political positions is for gain of votes rather than improving the governing process ethically and morally. It probably is very tempting for producers, executive producers and the editors and director who must answer to them, to paint the world of political conflict as simple black and white choices instead of the myriad shades of grey that actually exist.In this, those who shaped this film committed the usual stupidity of Hollywood and failed to believe the audience had the intelligence to understand and ravenously enjoy a drama with multidimensional protagonists and antagonists and multivalued morality and ethical concerns. It proved that the movie makers are less intelligent than their audience and (in this case, prefer pandering to their own predilections).The cardboard antagonist treatment made the denouement anti-climatic and unrealistically wishful and sappy. Especially since no one can find a Republican, Democrat, Independent with the intelligence, strength of character, will, and charisma to make that type of stance and/or that kind of statement, even as a lame duck in over forty years. It will be at least that long or a century before we see a politician like that again, if ever.The movie is well worth watching and the acting is very good, but the producers lessened the movie to the point where a 7 star average is probably accurate. They would have been better served to pay closer attention to Aaron Sorokin's better West Wing scripts and antagonists treatment.

This, of course, is an authentic characterization of the activities of our federal politicians. While this aspect of the movie is accurate and appreciated, the movie lacks character development (the character of Laine Hanson is never really developed What were the origins of her idealistic nature? Why would a scurrilous president want an idealist such as her for V.P?)Some things are not explained fully in The Contender. What makes matters worse is that much of the movie is unrealistic, in that the investigation of v.p.-elect Laine Hanson only takes place after the president has announced her as his choice. This, of course, would never happen She and everyone associated with her would have been thoroughly investigated before she would have even made it to his short list.My final beef with The Contender is that of the passive, naive, almost unresponsive character of Laine Hanson. This is no fault of Joan Allen's. Screenwriter Rod Lurie wrote-in a weak, frightened, inexperienced, idealistic female character for some reason). I often felt sorry for her, as she seemed totally unable to comprehend or negotiate federal politics. Christian Slater, as capitol hill newcomer Delaware Senator Webster, acts just a little too happy all the time, almost as if he's stoned. Very strange. I give a 7 to movies I feel are acceptable but nothing to write home about. I gave The Contender an 8 because of the great acting by Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman, and particularly for Bridges' rousing and unexpected speech at the end of the movie. If The Contender had managed to make a point, either Hanson's That one's privacy is paramount, or Speaker of the House Shelly Runyon's that moral behavior is top priority, then this would have been an admirable movie. Without a strong character written for Joan Allen, though, the movie deflates. Still, worth watching.

When word gets out,  pro-lifers and the religious right are going to skip it too.  That's too bad because, in spite of its heavy-handed liberal viewpoints, The Contender is an inspiring and well-acted movie about the politically powerful inside the beltway, written and directed by Rod Lurie.  The story has enough twists and turns to be thoroughly interesting even though the fate of the two heavies in the film, Senator Hathaway and Congressman Runyon is as contrived as Hollywood can make it.  To its credit, The Contender does not budge from its fundamental message about the importance of women in public life and the double standard they face, so well chronicled in the Clarence Thomas - Anita Hill debacle.  Just as Meg Ryan deserves a big hand for her role in the overlooked Courage Under Fire, Joan Allen is the player that will make The Contender a real contender when Oscar time comes around.  Her strong characterizations in Nixon and Pleasantville  were supporting roles; here in The Contender, she shines as Laine Hanson, the main underdog - fighting Democrats as well as Republicans, the powerful sensationalistic press, the heavily stacked subcommittee members, and even a wavering President who favors expediency over principle.  The acting is superb all around from the nattily presidential President Evans(Jeff Bridges in his best role in years) to the steely Chief of State Kermit (Sam Elliott) to the uninitiated Webster (Christian Slater) to the one-dimensional Runyon (Gary Oldham).  Director Lurie throws in some jewels here from the captivating summation given by Hanson to the arresting State of the Union speech by Hanson to the two juxtaposed scenes involving the gravestones at Arlington cemetery - one in the beginning when Hanson's nomination is about to be skewered and at the end when that same nomination seemed destined to be lost.  The Contender will be accused of everything from helping promote the Democratic party in an election year to succumbing to the lurid and tawdry details it was making a case against.  But there is no controversy about Joan Allen's strong portrayal of a high-minded woman in a political arena that remains largely a men's club.

It's not a matter of my disagreeing with the film's politics, but the didactic nature of the script and the fatal unbelievability of the characters.Case in point the judicial confirmation sequence, which features Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) criticizing Laine Hansen (Joan Allen) over her pro-choice stance, with invective, emotionalism and, strangely, cliches that would barely find their place on a pro-life pamphlet. I can't see a Senate confirmation hearing devolving into that kind of sensationalism -- forgive me if I'm wrong, but I can't believe that would ring true.I also found Jeff Bridges' Presidential character cynically portrayed to the point of annoyance. Maybe it would be wonderful to have a President so jaded about the sanctity of his position that he frankly considers the benefits of free food and catered whims the best part of the job. He's a buffoon who eventually attains a profile of dignity, but I don't believe the ascension is real. It all feels done for show. Other elements of the writing and characterization are broad as the Beltway; it's a careening script that reflects literary intelligence and fanciful characters at the same time that it betrays a political naivete.It's compellingly frustrating, because this is the best ensemble acting I've seen since Pulp Fiction. Despite the massive reservations I had with his character, Bridges is extremely fun to watch, as is Oldman. I loved Joan Allen's restraint and dignity.Lurie made an interesting film, Deterrence, which took an unbelievable premise and slowly infused it with an authenticity. Here he achieves the opposite, simply because he was too unwilling to risk his message being lost. If there were more subtlety in the film, if the sinister ambitions of the characters were more implied, it might have worked better. If the audience weren't blunted over the head with The Author's Message, that message might have been more powerful. This was the exact same problem with Philadelphia -- overwriting. Any film that comes right out and says its message directly, didactically, turns me off, whether or not I agree with the sentiment being expressed. The audience should be led to the trough, but not doused with the water.A big, though by no means bereft, disappointment.

He is pacing around the small room, and he is admiring paintings of former presidents, Woodrow Wilson, George Washington, and John F. Kennedy, even going so far as to mimic Kennedy's pose from the fabulous Norman Rockwell painting. It speaks of the uplifting and admirable traits of public service, and what good, honest men strive to believe as the reason they give their life in service to their country. But, you also realize that in order for Webster to succeed in the world of politics, and to do good for the country, he will have to transform into the types of politicians that President Evans, played by Jeff Bridges, and Sen. Runyon , played by Gary Oldman, are. That is, the key to the succeeding nature of someone in politics is not their conviction, their believes, or even their morals, but instead their ability to manipulate other people's convictions, believes and morals in order to gain the support needed to get something done for the American people.As much as this movie speaks of the privacy of candidates and the unscrupulous nature of both right-wing politics, which itself is a bias term (you never hear of the left-wing conspiracy, do you) and of the press, it tells us more about the flaws of candidates and of politicians in American culture. They don't necessarily have to do what is right, but what the American people will perceive as being right.The movie starts with a car crashing down from a bridge. An honorable governor, Jack Hathaway, jumps in to the water to save the people inside, but he does not succeed. We later find that he is on top of the list of vice presidential candidates, to fill the vacancy left by the death of the current one. He meets with the president and his advisors, and they tell him that he will not be recommended to succeed the vice presidency because of the spin that he let the girl die, as opposed to attempting to save it. `A girl died, and you let it happen,' they tell him, and we find that perception isn't everything, it's the only thing.The president chooses Sen. Hanson, who we first see in the film making love to her husband (on his desk). Joan Allen brings a toughness and determination to the role, and she proves that she is one of the great female actresses around today. She allows us to see through her character the moral stand that she takes, and the reasons why she takes it.Then you have Gary Oldman, who plays the old right-wing republican who heads the committee in charge of confirming her. I have always referred to Gary Oldman as my favorite actor, because he hides in his roles, and no matter how badly written, brings out the utmost in the characters he plays. Many times, people don't know who he is when I mention his name, and not because they haven't seen the films he is in, but that they didn't recognize him. Here, he is aided by a terrific script, penned by the director Rod Lurie, and he gives a great performance, Oscar-worthy, and allows us not to see him as a bad guy, but rather an opinionated one who is misguided in how he makes his choice for vice president. He disagrees with her on issues, most heatedly abortion, but when it comes down to it, he disapproves of her confirmation based on her gender, and the sex scandal is just a tool he can uses in order to allow his means to meet the desired end.The one scene I didn't like, and that didn't fit the movie, what near the end, when we find that Hanson wasn't the girl in the photographs, and that she was innocent the entire time. Instead of stating this, and avoiding all of the damaging allegations and investigations that ensued, she chose to stick by her view that the question, whether she was guilty of it or not, wasn't right to ask in the first place. I happen to agree with this, but I think that by stating so plainly that she was innocent, and then even going so far as to show that the heroic governor from the first half of the movie as a criminal, it takes away form that message. The important thing is that the question is wrong, and if you believe that, you shouldn't care if it is true or false.A lot has been made about the Hollywood typecasting of politics. It is almost always the good, heart-filled democrats trying to save the country from the mindless, mean-spirited Republicans who wish nothing more to destroy it with guns ablaze. I'm a registered republican, and I felt that this movie, although biased, is true to the nature of Washington, which itself is biased. Lets face it, voting party lines means nothing more then siding with your team, even if you may not believe in what the team is fighting for. I prefer movies like this, where the director has an obvious point of view, and uses it in a way that progresses the story, as opposed to some success and admiration driven director/writer, who is just looking for a box-office hit and is trying to make his movie all things to all people.

This is NOT a co-incidence.  People should be able to see the proceedings of government for themselves and make up their own minds without a movie commenting on it and in this case, sort of rubbing it in as it were.  The first hour is like taking a drive across the flatlands with maybe a nice sky in sight but shortly after that it becomes tiresome.  The political maneuvering is turned up in the second half and concludes well and while this is a solidly acted film, the writing (there are some good lines of political philosophy) and directing are rather protracted and are standard procedure.

As each character unfolds we see what could be conveyed as a little piece of ourselves.  	The Contender is a poignant drama chronicling the search for a new Vice-President when the previous Vice-President dies unsuspectingly.  As the smoke and controversy clear we find out that there are two front runners for the Vice-presidency. Those two incumbents are Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) and Senator Jack Hathaway (William Petersen).  Each of the incumbents is viciously investigated but the man who seems to hold the decision in his hands is Chairman Shelly Runyon (played by Gary Oldman). Runyon has some disregard and hidden vengeance for not electing Hanson and this tension sways his vote toward Jack Hathaway. Runyon is checked when the President in office (Jeff Bridges) nominates Hanson as his candidate. Now if Runyon is to get Hathaway into office he must convince a judiciary committee to strike down the President's nominee. The story continues as these political egos clash resulting in a very smart and interesting array of confrontations.	I loved the clashing of egos as each political figure began to focus upon their role in this race. I liked how the writer of the film brought each character into the light as a part of what we are. As I sat and watched each character's role evolve I saw fragments of me in each character. I love good scripts that have this knack.  	Some examples of this are as follows. First off take Joan Allen's history making female incumbent Laine Hanson who displays the grace, steadfast, moralistic and proud part of each of us. Second would be Shelly Runyon's character who displays the power, tact, desperation and vindication in all of us. And finally would be Jack Hathaway who displays the character traits of smug, contentious, abused, nervous and weak. What is interesting is how the script  unveils each of these characters as the movie unfolds. Another interesting angle is the character of the President who is a lot like each one but uses each trait tactfully. I place the President character between Runyon and Hanson.  	As each of these traits are explored and classified we have a great summing up of them all in the film's closing monologue. I liked how the speech talked about what is done in the political process and how that process relates to our lives. It doesn't matter who we might have been before but who we are today. 	By having such detailed characters we obviously will have some amazing performances and that is so true in the performances of Gary Oldman and Joan Allen. What I liked alot was how the director never lets any of the actors get to melodramatic or over-emotional in any particular scene. When emotion is displayed it was subtle and made a huge impact on a character's evolution. Just two slowly descending tears can stun an audience. That is magic. 	Joan Allen's portrayal of incumbent Laine Hanson deserves an Oscar nod because of how much we can relate to her in that role. Laine Hanson is Allen and this gifted actress immersed herself in this character. The couple scenes where you know she is being verbally undressed and it is that struggle that we see inside her character that is magical. It maybe a very subtle emotion that she displays but it encompasses her character.	Gary Oldman, who plays the devilish Shelly Runyon, has played a lot of vicious characters before but with Runyon he creates a new dimension on these characters. Since Runyon is apart of the political spectrum and has to be sophisticated and tactful it is sometimes hard to show how evil one is. But I tell you as you watch him you can cut the slime coming off this guy with a knife. 	The Contender is being compared to `All the President's Men' and `The Candidate' but what it may be is an original all its own. There is very little action or full-blown tension in this film unlike `All the President's Men' and `The Candidate'. There is humor, amazing dialogue and brilliant character analysis. The Contender is a powerful film.

I thought we might have been seeing a work-in-progress as the credits were ad-hoc and there was little music. That said, all the Republicans were portrayed in this movie as unsympathetic characters practicing some kind of sexual McCarthyism. There was little nuance. Further, the plot itself -- regardless of the politics -- did not flow. The back story was muddled. For example, it was hard to figure out that the Joan Allen character had once been a Republican and was, in fact, the daughter of a former governor. Another sore point was Lurie's decision to depict the President as a sort of cagey Homer Simpson -- bowling in the White House and always testing the agility to the executive mansion's kitchen.With respect to the politics, I see Gary Oldham has raised concerns about the one-sidedness of the movie and I agree with him. The physical transformation of Oldham is impressive, but the potrayal of his character's politics was off-putting and cartoonish.

I had put the film so completely out of my head that as I stood outside Roy Thomson Hall in the pouring Toronto rain, I made absolutely no connection between that trailer and the film for which I stood in line.  Had I realized that the film in the trailer and the film in the projector inside were one and the same, I swear that I would have sold my ticket and went back to the hotel to get a good night's sleep.And what a mistake that would have been!!!!!The Contender turned out to be the very best of the 22 films I saw the the film festival this year.  The entire cast, led by Jeff Bridges and Sam Elliott, delivers seamless, subtly nuanced performances.  Joan Allen's work is so perfect that it warrants separate mention - a good thing, too, because Senator Laine Hanson is one of the most complex, intelligent, and courageous female characters ever committed to celluloid, and a second-rate interpretation just wouldn't do.And then there's the story.  You bet - it's a timely subject, but that alone isn't enough to make this film automatically interesting.  Writer/directorLurie built this film around a solid, smart and knowing script, and capped it off with a totally satisfying ending.Of course, the best news is that unlike many terrific films shown at film festivals, this film opens everywhere in a few weeks.  Please don't be put off by the awful trailer (who put that one together, anyway?  Most trailers make films look better than they are, not worse!) as I nearly was, or the only-marginally-better commercial.

But more to the point, I thought that the films topic(s) and timeliness, was excellent.The basic premise of the film is that there are several people contending for the same position, a replacement for the seat of the Vice President of the United States, who recently died for reasons that the film didn't bother to explain, but were not apparently suspicious. The movie opens with a scene that is currently appearing in theater trailers, with a male politician being interviewed on camera, who witnesses a car careening off a bridge into the river, and this politician heroically attempting to save the trapped occupant. The other major contender is a senior female Senator from one of the large mid-western states.So on the front, we have a Male/Female confrontation for the same position. And... the major political players not only want a person from their own political persuasion, but they want one who is a man...Anyway, the usual Washington backstabbing ensues, and it is in this that the major theme of the movie, and ultimately of our own time, becomes apparent. What, besides ability, constitutes the qualifications necessary to run for one of the highest seats in our government? And what is considered unacceptable behavior, and where do we draw the line on the inquiry into private conduct and public conduct?Without revealing an ending that was only somewhat predictable in light of the movie's plot, yet still had a few major twists, I left the theater somewhat heartened that there are other people out there who can see the issues similarly to myself. The film explores the public's right to know, the  strengths and weaknesses of the position of the press in the political process, the evolving role of women in positions of influence, and ultimately, what constitutes the dividing line between public morality and private hypocrisy!

With fantastic performances by all involved, and a very talented director in the form of Rod Lurie (whose film Deterrence I was extremely impressed by), one wants to like The Contender. However, the film is ultimately ruined by the fact that the central argument is laid low in the form of a complete cop-out by writer/director Rod Lurie to stand firm on the film's principles.The story of the Contender centers around the attempt to put a woman into the Vice Presidency and how perceivably ugly secrets surrounding her sex life from her past are dug up to be used against here. Obviously a reaction to the impeachment of then President Bill Clinton, the film attempted to make the point that a person's private life should not be an issue in determining that person's character or value in any public position.Throughout the film, Joan Allen's character of Laine Hanson argues that she should not have to reveal to the public any details as to her personal life. Many arguments are presented to back this point up. However, Lurie pulls the rug right-out from under the entire film by having her character reveal in private to the President (played by Jeff Bridges) exactly what happened.Instead of actually vindicating the argument being made, Lurie torpedoes it by having the public figure (i.e. Allen's character) reveal to the public (i.e. the film's audience) the fact that the secret is bogus, but she is simply not talking about it. That the secret is bogus doubly ruins the film in that, not only is the film's argument destroyed in the revelation, the revelation is used to artificially add sympathy to Allen's character in a way that is both weak in execution and ultimately acts an admission of sorts that the counter to the film's argument is correct public opinion on personal issues DO matter. After all, if they didn't matter, Lurie wouldn't need to explain any of it.Add to this that you end up with every clichéd, anti-Republican optic -- including the wife of the token, teeth-spitting Republican Senator revealing that she had an abortion -- and you end up with a film that is almost a caricature of itself and ultimately cannot be taken seriously (please note I'm not a Republican, I'm simply being critically honest). In the end, the Contender simply can't hold its own in the ring when it beats its own central argument down.

This is a top-notch movie filled with great performances, insightful political drama and the tense pacing of a thriller at the top of its game. The production values of the film were all in place, and as a leftist liberal I certainly have no problem with the main thrust of the film's politics. Centred on the difficulties of putting a woman in the Vice President's office, The Contender strives for realism. The ghost of Bill Clinton and his infamous sex scandal hovers over the movie, as the alleged past sexual infidelities of senator Laine Hanson are unearthed and threatens her appointment as the first female VP. This is an intelligent film, but watching it in 2005 made me think of it as hopelessly idealistic.Timing is everything in a film like this, and in 2000 (when the movie was released) all of this material seemed possible putting a female in the second-highest office in the land (and a pro-choice, anti-death penalty, atheist female at that) didn't even seem that much of a stretch. There was a promise of social progression in the United States back then; religious fundamentalism had not yet come to fully infiltrate all spheres of American politics, and it seemed possible that the American people would wish to take a chance on their leaders, or at least that their leaders would take a chance on them. Jeff Bridges' articulate, intelligent President is manipulative and his role in the film (despite the professed feminist values of the production) is inherently paternalistic. What a difference five years make. Now we find ourselves in the grips of rampant conservatism and religious fundamentalism, strict binaries related to war and patriotism, and the uneasy sense that all of it, all the promise of the Clinton years, all the hope for liberality and freedom, have slipped away in America. This was an excellent film, not only for its value as a movie but for its glimpse into what might have been. And as nasty as this film gets at points, I suppose that is a very sad statement indeed.

This movie is basically about a Vice Presidential nominee, played by Joan Allen, who gets the nod from the President to replace his deceased VP. During the confirmation process, the legitimacy of her qualifications are called into question, partly because of her sexual past. The bias of this movie is heavy-handed.   For instance, Allen's nemesis, Gary Oldman, is representative of everything evil (that is, everything Hollywood considers evil).  An pro-life congressman involved in the confirmation, he grills Allen about her atheism, pro-abortion stance, stealing a best friend's husband, promiscuous past, etc.  Just in case the political boundaries are not clear enough for us, the dumb audience, Oldman orders large cuts of rare red meat every time we see him eat in the movie.  He twists Allen's arm to try the porterhouse in a meeting at a DC restaurant.  I guess that should be enough to let us know he does not have the endorsement of PETA.  On the other hand, the progressive Allen always orders the penne, which the chef assures us is spicy (just like Allen).  I am not really a political conservative, but I can see from movies like this one how there may be merit to conservatives' claims that Hollywood delivers a politically loaded product.Moreover, they don't even believe their own preaching.  <small spoiler ahead>.   The movie allows Allen to wax on about how her sexual past is no one's business.  (I actually agree).  But, the film insists on giving us a graphic description of what she was supposedly involved in (remember, this was not supposed to make a difference to her qualifications, and hence, the plot).  Finally, in the climactic scene in the movie, we find out that she was innocent of the rumors of her past.  Well, wasn't the whole point that it did not matter?  If so, why did the audience need to know?  Wouldn't it have been a better ending to not let us know?

The story, if it had been set thirty years ago (or on another planet), was good enough in itself one woman against the odds, sticking by her principles.  I didn't like Laine Hanson much, but I admired her.But alas, the movie also has a `message' that the American public holds female politicians, but not male ones, to high sexual standards.  Anyone who has observed the American political scene with any care at all knows that this is balderdash.  Sexual improprieties ended the careers of Bob Packwood and Gary Hart, cost Ted Kennedy his chance at the presidency, and almost brought down Bill Clinton &#150; all men.  Not one American female politician has experienced nearly so much uproar over some alleged sexual misconduct.  Thus, the film's portrayal of Laine Hanson as fighting for the rights of women (the film even ends with the silly dedication `To our Daughters') rather than the right to privacy, is outright silly.Less important, but even more bizarre, is the script writing Hanson into the Republican Party.  Hanson is an avowed atheist who is pro-choice, advocates banning (not merely restricting) private ownership of handguns, and gets livid not only at school prayer but even at the mention of Jesus' name in a public classroom.  In other words, she is well to the left of many Democrats, and would not belong in any wing of the Republican party.  I think this stupidity was inflicted on us to make the Republicans on display here appear to be anti-woman rather than merely anti-Democrat, by showing them attacking a woman from their own party.There's another significant overlooked point in the movie, but I'm not sure whether it's a flaw or a subtle lesson.  Hanson has in fact done something that is very seriously wrong; she has betrayed her best friend, Cynthia Charlton Lee, by stealing Lee's husband away from her.  Hanson even tries to defend her action, saying that she fell in love with William Hanson even though she didn't mean to.  Well, people do fall in love without meaning to, and they cannot be faulted for that.  But is this an excuse for Hanson taking her friend's husband from her?  Is it possible that Cynthia Charlton Lee was also in love with William Hanson, and that, being married to him, her love deserved priority?  And is Hanson's treatment of her best friend a relevant measure of her trustworthiness?But, the whole affair of Hanson vs. Lee barely makes a blip on the radar screen.  What obsesses the public, and takes up far more time in the movie, is not what Hanson did to her best friend, but what she did with a couple of drunk frat boys when she was a single woman in college, even though this is clearly irrelevant both to Hanson's professional qualifications AND to her moral character.  I don't know what to make of this.  Maybe the director is blind to the fact that Hanson's treatment of Cynthia was wrong, and means us to take at face value Hanson's defense of her own outrageous behavior.  But maybe Rod Lurie is very subtly pointing out to us that the so-called investigation into Hanson's `character' is really merely about sex and sensationalism, by showing us that when real evidence about Hanson's character comes to light, hardly anybody pays attention.The movie's stance on privacy is clear, but still thought-provoking.  I do think that moral character is relevant to picking political candidates.  Nothing in politics is done without resistance, and character determines whether a leader will fold in the face of resistance, try to compromise, or stand fast.  THE CONTENDER forces us to confront the question given that character is important, is it important enough to justify the kind of invasion of privacy that Hanson undergoes?Regardless of Lurie's sometimes questionable `messages,' he's clearly done a sterling job with his cast.  Granted, he had good actors to start with, but when EVERYBODY is doing their best, the director surely has a hand in it.  Joan Allen does a superb job doing a delicate balance between strength and pain.  Jeff Bridges gives a great performance as a cynical politico who finally discovers his principles, while Sam Elliott is wonderful as another cynical politico who never does.  And don't overlook Gary Oldman his Shelly Runyon is a far more ambiguous villain than he initially appears.  Unquestionably, his methods are evil, but you're never quite sure if his goals are equally evil.  At first it appears that he is persecuting Hanson just because she is female; as the story progresses, he claims to have other reasons.  You sense that he really believes this, that he wants to give up the fight against Hanson, but feels obliged to go on because he honestly thinks she can't be a good vice-president.  But you never learn just what his reasons are.Rating **½ out of ****.Recommendation  Watchable; just set your bunkum detector in high gear.

Petersen) is fishing. He tries to save her but fails. Meanwhile, President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) needs to appoint a vice president, since his just died. He's been in office for six-and-a-half years, and will appoint one as a `swan song'. So, after Hathaway's act of heroism, he seems like a shoo-in, right? Nope, since Evans is thinking of appointing Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), much to the dismay of many, including Representative Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman).Runyon and others don't want a female vice president, so they go and try to dig up dirt about Hanson's past. They finally conjure up a shocking sex thing from college. Rather than admit it, Hanson says that it isn't appropriate and `nobody would care how many people a man had sex with in college.'The Contender is an enthralling political mystery. It takes many twists and turns that you wouldn't expect. The ending is a nice but low-key slap-in-the-face, with it trying to squeeze a moral into it somewhere. Where most political movies have flaws, this one does, also. First off, they throw in too many characters for their own good. Not having enough is a problem, but too many is worse, because it will confuse, and ultimately bore, your viewers. I'm not saying, in any way, that The Contender is boring, but if they had toned down on the number of characters it would have been better.I thought Allen was great-she displayed the right amount of sensitivity, and cunning, that this role needed. She may not be the largest name in Hollywood, but she is a respected actress. Oldman was great, also-I thought he looks somewhat like Woody Allen (*sheepish grin*). His vileness seemed true. Bridges took off from his normal comedic-type roles (although he did have a few funny parts), and also displayed talent.Christian Slater played a role of Representative Webster, someone who seemed to get very involved in the whole scandal. Slater, to me, seems like a man whose name I know of and I know has been around for a while but I haven't actually seen a movie with him. Now that isn't true. I enjoyed him in this role. The intelligent script (written by the director), which, at first, seems simple, snowballs into directions you wouldn't expect, and it's fun (I guess you could say).I read that directed Lurie was an atheist, which he incorporated into the movie (Hanson is one). While I respect his decision, I thought it was kind of shameless promotion (not the best words). You can see how this situation parallels the government of today. You can actually feel for Hanson, which I was glad for, because for movies like this you need to get into the characters. Unfortunately, we couldn't do that with supporting ones. There's some dude named Kermit, and Saul Rubinek is some government person. But who? Don't ask me.The Contender is a very interesting and entertaining movie not without flaws but is still enjoyable.My rating 7/10Rated R for strong sexual content and language.

That is the basis for this story which explores several abuses in our society. Political chicanery and hypocrisy, a double standard in sex morality, and maybe another abuse get a critical examination. The Prez in our story decides to appoint a woman. A congressman for various reasons convenes a special House committee to examine her fitness for the job. He bitterly hates the appointee and sets out through his committee to destroy her reputation. He apparently unearths a sexual escapade when she was in college and exploits it to the fullest. The appointee, a strong minded woman of great courage refuses to comment on her private past.Naturally, I am not going to reveal the outcome, but you will find it interesting. This is a superbly crafted movie with excellent limning of the characters by the cast. Direction and editing make a rather convoluted story clear. About the only cavil is that the camera work seems uninspired. Maybe that was intentional, as adding to the realism. Don't miss this one if your taste runs to serious societal examination in film.

The movie starts like a stick of dynamite with the promises you associate with great acting, semi cinéma-vérité style, an absolutely powerful camera à la Renoir or Wells (I must have seen the first encounter between Oldman and Slater four times) and the feeling that the premises are set for a great finale. You feel that all the characters are plotting at more than one level. Film is coming of age, we will witness a blend of form and content, a pertinent tableau of American politics in which people clash and conspire and plot and don't give a hoot about the American taxpayers who sent them there to do another job in the first place. The promises of greatness manifest themselves in the tight editing, the masterful camera work, the documentary sound. You always expect the unexpected. The first hour is great American cinema. The filmmakers are in total control, all the elements, technical or otherwise, acting, etc, are into place. Sam Elliot is a great choice, a lot rests on his shoulders and he delivers. Gary Oldman gave himself the bad guy's role, which is unusual for a co-producer. He again proved the mastery of his art.However, you're watching a poor effort when you realize that it is not necessarily the movie that is one step ahead of the viewer but the other way around. Although the FBI special agent sequences with Kathryn Morris are cleverly peppered at the right time and places throughout the movie, more than one viewers guessed the puzzle, and the device is just that clever, but pointless. It is sad to think that it was, indeed, the central device of the narrative. As you sense more and more that you have been let down, the narrative is always winding down, and so are you. In cinema like in any art, rhythm is everything, and The Contender, formally and in substance, softens like a poorly made pottery.As I said, the first hour or so is great. Subsequently the problems start. We are being asked to believe that Joan Allen's character, Senator Laine Hanson is essentially a good politician who knows her issues and is ready to fight for them; she is victim of biased chauvinistic demagogues who don't see the real social combatant in her. Yet we first see her having sex, and even the last honor credit roll shows her in the same sex scene. In between we know she has strong principles, but learn next to nothing as to her political strategies.The glitch is that they forgot to shoot the last third of the movie. From a great American film, we end up with a cheap Hollywood movie ending. The liberal and unrealistic conclusion (the President's speech in Congress is so sappy it's embarrassing) is so irrelevant to the rest of the story and narrative that it appears it has been shot by somebody else about different characters.The Contender starts like dynamite, but ends up like a bomb&#133;  "},{"Title":"Not-so-intense plot has lots of holes","Date":"16 February 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Joan Allen.

It is truly a shame, because some fine performances are wasted here.First, what's right. Almost all of the performances here are understated and still powerful. Two glaring notes Gary Oldman and Sam Elliot, both of whom are good actors but seem hammy in comparison to the rest of the cast. (In fairness, Oldman has complained that the post-production process removed some of the ambiguity that he tried to express.) Also, this is the first 'political' movie that actually feels like real life. The protocols, the manners, the political dancing hits home as being quite authentic. Even when people are going for the jugular, it's done in an eerie, respectful way... just the way you see from watching committee meetings on C-SPAN.Now, what's wrong. In addition to the aforementioned one-sided political diatribe you have to endure, the mechanics of this movie simply make no sense. You have a president who has to decide who his new VP will be. He passes on one man for reasons which are not very compelling (although later you find out why his instincts were right) and picks a woman from his party's Senate contingent. He does this because she represents my politics. However, either the President has the worst investigators in history or employs staffers who are deliberately trying to undermine him. We are asked to believe that NO ONE ever vetted Laine to determine if there was anything embarrassing in her background. She couldn't have foreseen the photo, granted, but her affair with her best friend's husband, who is now HER husband, is another thing -- sorta like the smear done on Newt Gingrich, but you'll never catch this movie apologizing for that. So when Laine is attacked on these points, we get the it's nobody's business and if I were a man, no one would care treatment. On the other hand, when she's attacked on the basis of her rather extreme politics -- well, that's ALSO off-limits and hypocritical. I guess, then, the argument is that since she's a woman, she should get a free pass. Isn't that a double standard? And of course, the most ridiculous part of this is that the gold standard of this type of treatment was the Clarence Thomas hearings, where ten-year-old innuendos and unsubstantiated allegations that had nothing to do with his qualifications for the position were allowed to be used to lynch him in a manner MUCH more unprofessional than anything shown in this movie. But do you think the makers of this movie would be willing to draw that comparison? Oh, hell no. Conservatives are evil ... that's the moral standing for The Contender.Also, I would find it very difficult that a President would deliberately set up a governor of his own party to be exposed as a criminal fraud, even to score the bit of payback he gets out of it. Nor do I believe for a moment that a President would make that climactic speech during an open session of Congress -- not one that wanted any cooperation at all during the remaining part of his term. Nor did I find the plot twist of the antagonist's wife having a secret abortion particularly believable, especially in light of her speech about having to accept not having children as a price to pay for her husband's greatness. It was a clumsy attempt to paint all opposition to abortion-on-demand as hypocritical and dishonest. This would have been a great movie if any care had been taken to stick to the main point -- chauvinistic opposition to female leadership -- rather than drawing all these other unnecessary and divisive lines. It would be nice if these movies gave both sides the courtesy of acting like they operate from conviction and stop demonizing everyone with whom they disagree.

In the trailers it looked to have the same visual style as the magnificent THE INSIDER (I'm sure by the title people could have gotten the two confused), and with the tremendous Joan Allen on board, I figured it had to be a winner.  But then a curious thing happened the film actually began playing and the actors for whom I had such high expectations began speaking the words written by a simple-minded and myopic scribe with no concept of the words equal time.Now, let me preface this by saying that I am a registered Democrat (although a disenchanted one at that, I voted for Nader last year), and I share several (though not all) views that were spewed forth in THE CONTENDER.  This film, however, is not the proper forum for writer/director Rod Lurie to push his own extremist-left agenda on the unsuspecting filmgoing public (of which I am one) who expected to see a story of a stoic and dignified woman who stood up to those who held her down. Instead of that, I got a lesson in remedial ethics from a former film critic (!) who is less interested in discussion than he is in dissertation. (Note to Mr. Lurie many of us have college degrees, or at least degrees of intelligence, so please excuse us if we don't take your word as law).The most ridiculous part of this film is how it sets up straw men that are so easy to knock down.  Instead of making Allen's Laine Hanson out to be what she really is -- someone with extreme and highly contestable views -- he tries to make her dignified and above all those trying to tear her down.  This is done by taking various potshots at various stereotypes.  For example, a teacher that tells a young student that Jesus made everything which, of course, inspires the wrath of Allen/Hanson, because How Dare She?  In real life, no teacher in a non-religious school would ever have the temerity to say Jesus created everything, but if that is how Mr. Lurie can get his views on prayer in schools told, then that is how it would have happened.  The other example -- when Oldman/Runyan and another conservative legislator imply that they feel anyone who would even SUPPORT abortion is a murderer -- are slaps in the face of anyone who holds opposing views to Mr. Lurie.  Just because you have a camera and can get Jeff Bridges to be in your movie, that doesn't mean your opinion is worth more than anyone else's. Furthermore, if you want to defend Laine Hanson's views (as you obviously have a chip on your shoulder, Mr. Lurie) why don't you make it a full-fledged political discussion.Another thing if someone's personal life is so personal, why does Mr. Lurie feel the need to inject his own views into every facet of this film?  (Again, I want to reiterate I don't disagree with everything Mr. Lurie says) The main thrust of the story is Someone's personal life is no one else's business.  Okay, but forcing your own views on anyone who will listen is acceptable?  The hypocrisy actually made me angry.I didn't find Joan Allen to be dignified or heroic, and frankly, I didn't see any qualities that would cause Jeff Bridges (in his ridiculous phony-applause-rendering speech) to laud Allen/Hanson up to a status where it was obvious she would be a legendary political figure.I found the entire ordeal to be let's-pat-ourselves-on-the-back phony. Needless to say I won't be seeing Lurie's THE LAST CASTLE if this kind of tripe is what I can expect.All of this is, of course, one Cinephile's humble perspective.

Bridges revels in a role that in the hands of a less ingenious actor would become pure drivel, but at points he only barely manages. Elliott shows more color than usual, and Oldman carries off his usual and despicable portrayal of the villain. Yet, despite strong performances, the abysmal pabulum that passes for a script unites with the inept camera direction to create film that unwittingly mocks its own message. In short, departing from a worthy and crucial message, the script slips readily into simplistic jingoism, and in an attempt to sustain (or mirror) the script's halting realism, the jittery camera work simply annoys.

As actors, they portray their craft well.As one who lived and worked in Washington, D. C. as a journalist, and covered some of the very type of people this film tries to depict, I can tell you this story has more holes in it than a piece of Swiss cheese.  I will assume for the sake of space that you already know the basic story, so let me just make some specific comments.The ending speech by President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) would not, and could not ever happen.  He called for a live vote (as opposed to a dead one I guess) right there, on the spot, during a joint session of Congress.  This violates so many protocols and traditions, it would take way too long to list them.  Suffice it say, that when the president speaks before a joint session of Congress, he is there as the guest of the Speaker of the House and the president pro tem of the Senate.  The POTUS (an acronym used throughout the film meaning President Of The United States) has NO PLACE calling for a vote at ANY TIME in the legislative chambers.  He doesn't have the authority.  I could not stop myself from laughing profusely, when President Jackson Evans called for such a vote.Besides, Joan Allen's (Sen. Laine Hanson) nomination hadn't even gotten out of committee.One major point that seems to have been missed by all previous reviewer of this movie, is the fact that the Senator admitted to being a home wrecker just seven years previous to her nomination as vice-president.While her supposed college sexual escapades may have been overlooked, this would not have been.Also, her call, for what amounts to a repealing-of-the Second Amendment, would not have gone unnoticed by a little organization called the National Rifle Association.Others also have commented on her willingness to promote her atheistic ideas.  This would have never passed muster.  And in her closing statement to the committee, she stated the Founding Father's concern regarding religious freedom exactly BACKWARD.  While Joan Allen may have played the ideal of some godless, selfish, gun-hating, pro-abortion leftist, she would have never been confirmed in the real world.  For a film to work for me, it has to get me to suspend my disbelief.  A good film can do this with good acting, a good story, and a reasonable premise.  This film only got half way there.  The acting was decent.  The story started out fairly well, but soon fell to pieces.

This nation will not have a woman president for quite some time yet- I believe we will have a black male president first, even though women are more than half the population and blacks are something like 14%. This is still a country deeply afraid of women, and the combination of politics and the double standard is a vicious one. It also briefly tackles the hypocrisy of anti-abortionists and the separation of church and state. I admire the film-makers for addressing these issues, but I also have my 'howevers'. First of all, the ending was frankly overwrought. Second of all, this movie is ostensibly a fictional work. If you believe that, you probably also believe 'Planet of the Apes' wasn't about the mistreatment of blacks and that 'The Crucible' wasn't about McCarthyism. This movie was at least in part about the Clinton administration, although I think that was inevitable. You can no longer make a movie about sex in politics and have it not be at least somewhat about Clinton's terms in office. It's also frankly pro-Democrat. Now the thing is, I don't have a problem with it defending the Clinton administration or it being pro-Democrat. While I disagree with some of the things Clinton did, his sexual life is his business. That's not being anti-morality, it's being pro-privacy, and I applaud a movie that upholds that ideal when our culture is awash in sleaze and our bedroom behavior is daily fodder for tabloids. I'm not Democrat, but I'm even less inclined toward Rebulicans, and I will agree with another reviewer here that no Democrat is so angelic as Joan Allen's character, although there are certainly Republicans like Gary Oldman's. As for Hollywood being awash in liberals- I would imagine so. Film-making is on some levels still a creative endeavor, creative people will have a higher tendency towards liberalism, and conservatives are all for advocating environments that suffocate creativity and free-thinking. On the other hand, there has already been a very fine and honest movie made about the Clintons- it's called 'Primary Colors', and it comes with a strong recommendation from me. I cannot believe there is a politician as noble as Laine Hanson- rising to that level of power ensures that. Indeed, I believe there are very few people that noble. Some of the film-makers behind 'The Contender' might well have a spark of it, but were that spark full-blown, this would have been a more honest film.

What I feel like I can say is this On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give this movie an 8.  Why?  First, Joan Allen is an awesome actress.  Second, the movie was good, but had some flaws.  The first act was brilliant.  It was interesting, it set up the characters, and it got you hooked.  The second act was also very good.  It threw some good plot developments at you, and was loaded with surprises that kept you wondering what would happen next.  Unfortunately, the third act of this movie wasn't bad, but lacked the greatness of the first two acts.  The focus of the movie seems to slowly shift from the main character (the vice presidential nominee) to the president about half-way through the second act.  The president in this movie is a portrayed well, and could probably carry his own movie, but I really don't like it when movies do this kind of shifting.  Then, the film's final scene is extremely similar to the last scene of The American President.  (If you're going to rip-off another movie, then it's a good idea to rip-off a good one, so at least they got that right.)  I'm also not clear on what Christian Slater's character really had to do with the outcome of the movie.  On a more trivial note, there was a small problem with accuracy in this movie.  Hardly any of the sets in this movie looked like their real life counter-parts (which most Americans are familiar with thanks to CNN and C-SPAN).  Personally, I would also think that the V.P.'s nomination would be derailed by her controversial views on religion, rather than who or how many people she had been physically intimate with 20 years ago.  The point of the movie is that there's just some questions that people shouldn't have to answer.  Remember, this film came out during a presidential election where one candidate was avoiding questions about his drunk driving record/alleged drug use, while the other candidate was trying to down-play the fact that his predecessor had been impeached for answering a question he shouldn't have (and, yes, they do mention Pres. Clinton by name in the movie, which makes we wonder if the movie is set 8 or 12 years in the future).

Nothing like a little nip of endangered species during a little chat.  The most glaring problems, whether I noticed them right away or whether it came out in discussion afterward as the movie crumbled upon reflection, come from the fact that the movie was not only cut and sweetened with music but also rewritten and re-shot.  This must be the case.   At the heart of the story, we are willing to accept the rote Hollywooden conceit that personal lives must be overlooked in order for government to function.  Fine.  Our leading lady opens the infamous file with photos of a gang bang and HAS A FLASHBACK to that event.  In movie language, I can't see how we are supposed to interpret that any other way other than yep, folks, like it or not this girl was popular at that party.  We feel kind of sympathetic as she evades the question as to whether the event occurred.  We may want her to get away with it.  And then we are told something which negates the entire reality of the movie.  The movie honchos cave in to the belief that the movie-going public will not accept a colorful past in their heroine, and so like magic. . .guess what?  A flashback lies. Next, there is another woman who apparently takes money to perform a dumb stunt involving a car and water - and doesn't take even the most obvious precaution like winding down her window to ensure against Murphy's Law.  But that is nothing compared to the silliness of the main problem.I can see why Gary Oldman, still the best in the cast, has disowned the movie.  As Executive Producer, he helped raise part of the funding for the project and then had to watch an even-handed script become distorted and contrived after the fact.  His character the right-wing villain was much more fleshed out, apparently, and may have been as sympathetic as the prettier characters.  But of course, since he is losing his hair and is against abortion, he must be the heavy.  Blah, blah, blah.  Even a master like (distributor) Spielberg has his blind spots.  And this movie is the result.  Either we accept the bad girl as a Vice President, or we don't.  An interesting theme.  Maybe somebody will make a movie about it some day.

A minor but unnecessary inconsistency jumps out when nominee Joan Allen enjoys a cigar with President Jeff Bridges.  Not much earlier, when stating her position on the issue to the Congressional committee, she blasts the tobacco industry and suggests criminal penalties for those who sell tobacco products.

But during the middle third the story line takes a sharp turn. Its focus narrows from the original good vs evil themes, and becomes distinctly partisan. By the final third, the message is reduced to a diatribe against all things conservative and Republican.

Where to start. First off the whole orgy thing. The character says that a MAN wouldn't be judged on having sex with multiple female partners. Well that is a distortion because it wasn't a question of how many men she had slept with, it was a question of did she participate in an orgy. In my opinion. there IS a difference between having multiple partners over a lifetime as opposed to having multiple partners in one sitting! Not that I'm judging but I don't think I'm alone on this one. You can't tell me that if someone found pictures of George W. in some hot orgy that those pictures wouldn't have `found their way' to the internet. I also feel it would have effected how people think of him. Can we get over the fact that men are different than women! Why is that so hard!  As a man I will never know what it is like to carry a child inside me. Is it so wrong to say that most men and women define sex differently? (I did say most).. I guess, right or wrong, we do judge women differently because they pretty much say yes or no when it comes to having sex. Maybe it's in our nature or maybe because we (men) don't have to actually have a baby (big deterrent) that we just see the fun part and not the full consequence? Let's face it. If men got pregnant it would be a whole other world. That's probably the real underlying reason for the difference in judgment of women. Don't try to understand it. So our main character should be applauded because she is pro-choice? There is so much gray area there I don't think either side should be made to look evil. No one wants to revert back to `back alley abortions' but on the other hand, is abortion the only answer? Has it become too convenient? Instead of bringing that up, pro-life people are made to look evil in a typical one-sided black or white view. Again this was used in the Church Vs State part of the movie. It's sad and alarming the fact that she is appalled that her child was introduced in school to a man who preached things like `Love Your Enemy. Be Kind To Those That Hate You. Give To The Poor. kindness, love, fairness. amongst many other beautiful things. Yet she stands proudly with music swelling and professes her belief in this country and what it stands for! Considering this country was built on the near genocide of the American Indian. The fact that we still use slave and child labor (we've just moved it out of our country) and that we pretty much squash anyone who gets in our way. doesn't seem to bother her! Which belief is more of a `fairytale'?  Then she wants to take all the guns out of every house! Well even the liberal Michael Moore has shown that guns aren't the problem. Other countries that have just as many guns don't have near as high a death rate. Don't address the real problem. just get rid of all the guns! Okay Next subject.The fact that they had to change the appearance of Gary Oldman to make him look and sound like some smarmy conniving evil man going up against the good looking do good President and the poor patriotic vice presidential candidate is so transparently cartoonish good guy bad guy that it's laughable! Give me a break! Oh. another thing. The fact that this righteous woman stole her `good friend's' husband proves what. `That love can't be controlled'. That she is only human and we should forgive her. So by that standard I guess being paranoid and power hungry are also `only human' so we should forgive Nixon. The question is. if a person can lie to and cheat on a `good friend' what is to stop them from doing the same to perfect strangers. AKA - The American People. By that standard, everything done by humans must be considered `only human' including murder I suppose. Not everyone commits murder but not everyone sleeps with their friend's husband or wife either. Where do we draw the line? Of course by the end of the movie the `evil man' is ousted and the pure innocent `only human' character is raised to the level of sainthood. Start the violins please. Funny thing is that included on this DVD was a little featurette. they had the gall to call Frank Capra's `Mr. Smith Goes To Washington' `Simplistic'. This movie was dressed up, but a totally simplistic attack on one of the 2 main political parties. As much as I dislike total liberals I have the same disdain for the total conservatives.

Bridges makes for an amusingly laid back chief executive, certainly a vast improvement on the current mediocre real-life inhabitant of the White House. Only Christian Slater lets the side down in a superfluous role. The film itself is generally less convincing, however. From the outset the White House seems a much less vibrant centre of decision-making than the fictitious Bartlet White House depicted in the TV series The West Wing. Nevertheless, the story proves genuinely compelling throughout most of its running time, before descending into an orgy of sickening sentimentalising towards the end. Nobody could reasonably disagree with the key tenets of Allen's closing speech to her prosecutors, yet the tone is completely undermined by the cheesy &#145;stirring' music imposed on the background. The same is true of Bridges' speech at the end. PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD The Contender veers between being overly naïve and overly cynical in turn. Would any modern leading politician relinquish the opportunity for high office, by refusing to challenge an accusation against him or her, which could so easily be proven to be false? But on the other hand is it any less implausible that a State Governor would pay a woman to drive off a bridge just so he could rescue her and bask in the resulting good publicity? (or that he could find anyone prepared to do this?).Ultimately, The Contender misses the point. It shouldn't matter a jot if a girl was promiscuous at college &#150; she should still be able to ascend to high office. The Contender fudges the issue by revealing the girl at the party in question to have been a different person. Even so, for all its flaws, politics junkies will still enjoy it and if you want to see Oldman's first Oscar-winning performance, go see. Overall Six out of ten.

Being neither (and not even an American), I feel that this works rather well as a film, but &#x97; for me &#x97; is spoilt by the huge dollops of American treacle poured over it in the final scenes. The 10/10 marks given here by other &#x97; probably bleeding heart liberal &#x97; reviewers baffle me. First, NO film should get 10/10, in order to leave that mark for some future work so extraordinarily good that it leaves everything else in the shade. Second, I suspect that top mark owes rather more to applauding the sentiments emoted by the film than the quality of the film itself. But that quality is good. I think Jeff Bridges always gives a good performances and seems to choose those parts which allow him to give a good performance. Sam Elliot as the ultra-pragmatic foul-mouthed chief-of-staff is also hugely watchable, as is the quiet dignity of Joan Allen, the vice-presidential nominee with possible a dark secret. Our very own British Gary Oldman gives equal good value for money as the committee chairman in whom principle shades off into almost pure malice. Tension is also well-sustained to the end, with a plot that has sufficient twists and turns. Some failings of the film would include the rookie and principled Congressman portrayed by Christian Slater who gets himself appointed to the congressional committee ratifying Allen's nomination even though he has no experience &#x97; the justification for his appointment is never explained and Slater has no organic role in the plot at all. What is he there for other than to symbolise that 'our young are our future' or some such guff? And just why is Oldman (committee chairman Sheldon Runyon) so against Allen? These are, though, minor quibbles, and in many ways the more petty the gripes, the better the film. But the film's sentiment... I know that the U.S. provides by far the biggest market for Hollywood and is thus the market Hollywood tries to satisfy, but please spare a thought for the rest of us non-Americans who don't &#x97; and cannot even be expected to &#x97; share in the sentimental fiction that is the U.S. soul. (And I am, of course, bound to admit that all other nations, including the Brits, have such national fictions. We, for example, still fondly regard ourselves as 'a nation of seafarers'; the French are convinced that every last man, woman and dog is 'an intellectual'.) The U.S. fiction, as promulgated in The Contender, is that America is the home of ultimate truth, decency, honesty and freedom (achievable, of course, once all the bad Yanks out there, like Governor Hathaway, who tried to rig his own act of heroism, have been overcome and brought to book.) Now, admittedly, The Contender was made in 2000, but Guantanamo Boy, Abu Ghraib, the whole Iraq fiasco, various acts of massacre, but also the Vietnam War etc do rather spoil the 'home of the brave' etc act. In fact, they make it seem like a joke in poor taste. But, as I say, that is no criticism of the film as a film.

The Contender is the very worst sort of heavy-handed and trite propaganda, that twists reality for it's own highly suspicious purposes.Made shortly after the Clinton-Lewinksy scandals, the plot re-imagines a similar White House scandal, but centered around a female Vice Presidential candidate (a capable and always interesting Joan Allen, wasted here) who may have participated in an orgy while a college student. She is opposed for nomination by a sort of Newt Gingrich/Ken Starr hybrid creation played by Gary Oldman (excellent, but perhaps has done this sort of one dimensional villain a few times too many). Jeff Bridges, as a liberal Cllintonesque President, chews the scenery in a hammy performance that seems like leftover bits of The Big Lebowski. (The running gag about him ordering elaborate snacks from the White House kitchen are particularly lame.)The Contender has all the cinematic subtlety of one of those old silent movies that feature a saintly blonde heroine, victimized by a Snidley Whiplash type. All the bad guys -- who are, of course, Republican's ONLY -- are flat, one-note caricatures. The heroic Democrats are flat, one-note hero's, given to making stirring speeches.The politics of the film is so extreme and one-sided that it left me scratching my head. A former Republican Senator (Allen), the daughter of a famous Republican Governor, switches to the Democratic party...although she is openly an atheist, pro-choice, anti-gun and so on. How on earth did she ever get elected as a Republican with such a platform? Her character is accused of participating in a orgy -- a phony accusation which she can easily disprove with a few words -- yet her refusal to do this is the basis for the entire film.Sadly, the underlying ideas (how much of a political candidates personal life is legitimately worth of scrutiny and how much is entitled to be private?) is a very valid idea to discuss. In this film, the refusal of the script to tackle this idea head on renders the concept moot. It comes across as a lot of rather sad and deluded boosterism for political causes which are increasingly defeated at the polls by the voting public.....The Contender is entirely out of touch with contemporary politics and it really has nothing worthwhile to say about Clinton, Ken Star or Monica Lewinsky, if indeed that was the purpose of all this sturm and drang.I endured this film feeling deeply embarrassed for both Democrats and legitimately liberal causes. Fortunately, it was a box office failure (big surprise there!), and only an occasional presence on TV, so in this post 9/11 era (when presumably we have more life and death issues on the table than politicians and their sexual peccadillo's), this feels older and more tired out than the most simplistic political films of the 40s and 50s.

That she's a woman is the least of her problems.  Her real obstacles are, in ascending order being a trifle too clear-headed, being honest, and being an atheist.  (Actually it's the last two together that damn her.)  And that's why the film is so good.  The plot requires a candidate with unfashionable beliefs and integrity, and the script has the guts to actually give her both.  The speeches in this film - all of them - were clearly written by people who took the time to try to understand what people who say such things believe, and why.This is not a simplistic film, whatever you may have been told.  Nor are the characters simplistic.  How does one tell if a character has been poorly developed?  Most people employ the completely unreliable black and white test measure a character's goodness; if it is higher than some arbitrary level, the character is too good; if it is lower than some other arbitrary level, the character is too evil.  This is a ridiculous way to think, even subconsciously.  There's no reason WHATEVER, in ANY kind of fiction, why a character shouldn't be very good or very bad, or why the entire fictional world shouldn't be populated by people who are one or the other.  The real test we should employ is this does the character's motivation make sense?  And the answer, in this film, is yes.  In every case yes.  -I've heard people say otherwise, but never convincingly.  I've heard it said (for instance) that we don't know why the president never asks Hanson to stand down, when in fact it's made perfectly clear to anyone paying attention he's stubborn, he wants her, and - this is the more subtle point - he half realises all along that he would demean himself by doing so.  Whether such considerations would weigh with actual presidents is beside the point, since it's perfectly believable that they'd weigh with HIM.The film makes but four mistakes worth remarking upon, only one or two of which matter.  The camerawork could be improved.  Lurie decided to go with the camera-following-the-characters documentary approach, which is never a good idea - but he drops this foolish affectation in all the important scenes, so we can forgive him.  And the president's speech at the end... in real life, I know, he would wrap himself even more in the flag and make even less sense, but we, the audience, ought to have been given something better.  Still, what matters is THAT he gave the speech, not what in particular he said in it.  So we can forgive THAT.  -Then there's this Hanson does finally confess to someone what really happened on the night in question.  No reason why she shouldn't; but WE should not have been told what happened.  The point of the film is that it doesn't matter; and if it doesn't matter, we needn't be told.  I, for one, wasn't even curious.As for the fourth mistake...Runyon's nefarious plan seems to go off without a hitch, and Lurie is savage on a political process that would allow this to happen, but two elements of that process escape close scrutiny the press, and the public.  (The latter, indeed, escapes all scrutiny.)  Runyon leaks his dirt to the press, who dutifully make hay of it, in order to morally outrage the public, who are dutifully outraged.  His plan would have failed had either press or public refused to cooperate.  How does the PUBLIC, in particular, escape blame?  In a democracy - even one with an electoral system as absurd as that of the United States - the electorate cannot deny responsibility for the way its representatives behave.  Why does nobody in the film criticise Joe Voter, or Joe Tabloid-Buyer?I confess to not minding THIS lapse very much (even though it's something I feel strongly about).  The film is generally so much more intelligent than you'd expect it to be.  Look, for instance, at the way Hanson's interrogation is structured.  Anyone can see how clever Runyon is in laying political snares, but only Hanson can see how unintentionally clever he is in laying MORAL snares.  (She isn't caught by any of the latter, but she IS grazed.)  It's really two interrogations at once, and only she - and the audience - can see them both.

This former L.A. film critic-turned-filmmaker has created a crackerjack political thriller attuned to the temper of its times.  In this era in which one politician after another has fallen victim to the cutthroat `politics of personal destruction' as practiced in the media, in the committee hearing room and in the backrooms of campaign headquarters around the nation, `The Contender' emerges as a timely, astute and politically savvy drama.Like most contemporary films that deal with political issues, `The Contender' demonstrates an obvious left leaning bias.  As usual, it is the Democrats who are portrayed as the righteous speakers of truth and the Republicans who are shown as the scheming, unctuous and conniving dispensers of hatred and rumormongering.  Jeff Bridges stars as President Jackson Evans, a well-meaning, seemingly moral man who, upon the sudden death of his vice president, nominates a woman, Senator Laine Hanson, to be his replacement.  Gary Oldman plays the Republican chairman who will stop at nothing in his efforts to torpedo the nomination, even if that means exposing her rather torrid sexual past for all the world to see (although, in many ways, his obsession with ruining the chances of a candidate he feels to be less qualified in favor of one who is more beloved as a national figure makes little practical sense because wouldn't he, as a member of the rival party, be MORE inclined to support someone he thought would bring trouble to the present administration?)If you can see past the partisan propaganda, you will find `The Contender' to be one of the most riveting films of the past several years.  In many ways, it reminds one of those Biblical spectaculars that moviemakers like Cecil B. DeMille used to churn out in the 1950's, the ones that would allow us to wallow in the depiction of all sorts of `sinful' activities, yet when the divine judgments began to fall on the perpetrators, permit us to feel morally superior to it all at the same time.  In a similar way, `The Contender,' may come out foursquare against the obsession we seem to have concerning the sex lives of our elected officials &#150; but it sure has a fun time devoting two solid hours to the topic.  And its fun is ours.One of the reasons that `The Contender' succeeds so well is because Laine Hanson, as portrayed by the brilliant Joan Allen, is an endlessly fascinating and enigmatic character.  We never know quite what to make of her and it is this sense of moral imbalance that draws us in to her plight. Had she been made an innocent victim or a goody-two-shoes, she would quickly lose our interest.  As the President, seemingly more concerned with ordering up spectacular dishes from the White House kitchen than with the pressing concerns of affairs of state, Jeff Bridges cuts just as believable and compelling a figure.As with virtually all films of a political nature, the characters' actions are occasionally inexplicable within the context of practical politics. For example, President Evans rejects one of his top candidates for the VP position for ludicrous reasons.  When Governor Jack Hathaway attempts but fails to rescue a woman from her vehicle that has crashed to the bottom of a river, Evans tells Hathaway that he believes the Republicans will try to bring up parallels to Chappaquiddick in an attempt to sink his nomination. Not only is that a patently absurd possibility, but Evans seems blithely unconcerned about the much worse drubbing he and his eventual nominee end up undergoing.  Which leads us to the next implausibility &#150; Evans' sticking by Hanson far past the point where any real president would have asked for the candidate to withdraw her name.  Oh well, `The Contender' may not always ring true in its plotting, but it definitely gets the job done as a piece of titillating pulp drama.My only serious complaint with the film comes in its closing stretches. Perhaps it is too much, in these days of mandatory happy endings and feel-good emotionalism, to expect the type of clear-eyed cynical conclusions we were treated to in movies like `The Candidate' or `The Best Man,' but the upbeat, fairy tale resolution here is unworthy of all the good stuff that has gone before it.  By climbing onto a soapbox and deigning to lecture to us all, Lurie cops out on both Hanson and the audience - striving for the type of phony inspirationalism that went out with `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' way back in the 1930's.  Such an obvious sop to the box office leaves us with a bit of a sour aftertaste after all is said and done. (Also, Lurie needs to shed himself of the gimmick he seems to have latched onto in both his films thus far &#150; that of the melodramatic `surprise' turnabout ending.  It didn't work in `Deterrence' and it doesn't work here).Yet, despite its sundry flaws, `The Contender' emerges as one of the most compelling and fast-moving two hours you are likely to see in a long time. You may feel like taking a shower when it's all over (maybe that explains the need Lurie may have had in providing a `moral bath' in the last 15 minutes or so), but you will at least have had a great time getting dirty.

After seeing this film, I hoped they had been paid well. It certainly did not showcase their talent. The Contender has no characters, just caricatures - no script, but cliché piled on top of cliché - no plot, just a two-hour harangue filled with every bumper-sticker political slogan imaginable. If it was meant to be an intelligent criticism of the state of American politics, it actually fell below the actual state of American politics (if such a thought is even conceivable). Contemporary screenplays provide more than ample evidence of the general poverty of writing in Hollywood, but The Contender has to rank as one of the worst political screenplays ever. Every politician is a cynical and amoral SOB and though I may tend to agree with the characterization, it would have been useful to have someone show some small degree of integrity. Of course, Ms. Allen is Ms. Integrity through and through - she seems consistently honest, though one marvels at the superficiality of her political philosophy and the motivation for her behavior. At the conclusion of the film, the director informs us that he made the movie for our daughters. If I wanted my daughter to enter politics, live a life of personal integrity, and actually do something positive for this country, this would be the last film I would recommend to her.

I cannot fault any of their performances, or for that matter of any of the supporting cast.Now, as to plot. Generally believable, although there were some details that didn't set quite right. For example, we all know what the chamber looks like when the President addresses Congress...we see it every year during the State Of The Union speech. Although the President's address to Congress here was quite dramatic and well done, that chamber didn't look anything like the House Of Representatives. And, also near the close of the movie, I have a little trouble believing that the Secret Service would lose the President out on the White House lawn...which doesn't slope, BTW (I lived in the D.C. area)...so the scenes at the White House and Capitol may have been filmed at the Virginia State Capitol).But, these little matters don't detract from an excellent plot that is high political drama, but generally quite believable.Highly recommended.

The story of a moral furore over the election of a replacement Vice President, leaked and stoked for political purposes, resonates with the moral dissolution that marked the end of Clinton's period of office.IMDb notes that director Lurie prepared the part of Laine Hanson specially for Joan Allen and it shows I haven't seen Erin Brokovich at this time of writing but I will now given that Julia Roberts' performance denied Allen a best actress Oscar. Jeff Bridges plays the controversial President role as far as it will go, with whimsy but also a decorously maintained competence. In fact that chief political characteristic of concealing character and intentions is the overriding theme of the film, also exhibited by the fantastically irascible Gary Oldman. A rather obvious but no less gripping political street thug, Shelly Runyon wants to parachute his own (Republican) man into the vacant position. A furious battle of accountability vs privacy ensues.It's a gripping tug of war between Runyon and Hanson with a first class supporting cast, the like of which would be familiar to initiates of The West Wing's ensemble.

Actually though, The Contender really isn't about sexism. To be sure, it's there, simmering beneath the surface, but this is more about the spin of facts in the pursuit of getting what one wants.The Vice President is dead, and President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) needs to nominated someone. His choice is Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) because he wants to be remembered for putting a woman in such a high position of power. Everyone else wants the obvious choice, Governor Jack Hathaway (William Peterson), who conveniently just displayed an act of heroism that the whole country knows about. But Evans wants Hanson, and the Chairman of the Committee for nominating her, Sheldon Runyan (Gary Oldman) will do anything to stop her from being appointed. Luck comes his way when it's discovered that Hanson may have been involved in some unsavory sexual activities in college.The ability to manipulate the media is key in every position of power. Take Paris Hilton for example; she's a household name despite doing almost nothing really worth noting. The same goes for politics. The fact that any sexual act that Hanson may have done doesn't have anything to do with her ability to fill the spot is beside the point. Runyon (and everyone else) knows that morals and image run high in this country, and Hanson can be destroyed by something simply because it doesn't look good. That's what this movie is about, and that is what makes this movie compelling.The acting is outstanding. Joan Allen is wonderful as Hanson, a strong woman who sticks to her guns at all costs, but is willing to take the advice of others. Jeff Bridges is nicely understated as the President, as is Christian Slater. The best performance comes from Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable, both visually and audibly, in his role as Runyon. This is Oscar material (how he wasn't even nominated for this role (or any role) is beyond me). He's slimy, but smart enough to cover himself. He emulates the worst of politicians.Rod Lurie has created a splendidly written and complex script (that should have gotten at least an Oscar nod for it. The dialogue feels so natural, it's like David Mamet, only better. It doesn't feel scripted, and it's easy to believe that politicians speak in exactly the same way. His directing is less impressive though. He has great control over his actors. The usage of uh's and stammers are brilliant; again it sounds unscripted and very natural. His storytelling is not as good. Everything seems to blend together and things get lost and found here and there. Then there's a problem with his heroine. There's really no reason to support her except for the fact that she's the underdog and Runyon is so despicable that we'd love to see him fall; he gives a reason why, but it has nothing to do with her ability to perform the job. Plus the final 15 minutes are so overblown and based on a contrivance that is to unbelievable that it's almost insulting to what came before it. Lurie probably wanted to end everything neatly, but he could have done a better job.The Contender is an adult film. It is highly intelligent, and the dialogue is dense and subtle, almost like Michael Clayton (though this is a little more straightforward, and a lot more interesting). It doesn't dumb down its content and or the dialogue. At times it can be kind of a chore to get through (this is not popcorn entertainment), but it's well worth it.

Four rounds it would go from intro to the epilogue. For the first thought that comes to mind every time I think of this film, is Jeff Bridges. He is absolutely, an under-ranked and I think under-appreciated actor. He was Presidential, as President Evans. He exuded charisma, power and a solid stature. He was the most believable for a presidential character of almost every film, with a president in the storyline. You would think thats' just how it has to be, his actions and the way he spoke and carried his role was and is inspirational to me.On the second point, Gary Oldman is a mastering and wise 'player' in his acting and in this as Sheldon Shelly Runyon a D.C. political investigator. Oldman is very diverse, from what he has played in his ever-widening past and present resume, he is an award winner. He adds a broadness to just about anything he is in. It would have to be very energizing to work with him in a directorial capacity, I would imagine. Joan Allen as senator Laine Hanson. Looking for appointment but with a blemish on her past. Joan was satisfying as the good or not-so-good senator, I think she has played several things pretty well, this I think was the second best of all five, that are my top end favorites of hers'. And good Ole Sam Elliot as Kermit Newman, in the Oval-office . The president's man. Inside the inner circle of power, a real adviser/decision maker. Sam is a cowboy's cowboy. should have had the chance to play opposite of John Wayne. He is a great hard case! He is even a great good guy depending, but I kind of like him more with an 'edgier' appointment. It's just more depth when he is playing the offensive. Then there is the story about this sweet woman that is going to be appointed, but has this mark on her past, and through the investigation, she and her hubby William Hanson (Robin Thomas) are basically put through a political nightmare as they and the country look her over. Out of the story though, through the investigation that Rep. Sheldon Runyon (Oldman) is underway with, I enjoyed her small meet with her father, Mr Billings, Oscar (Phillip Baker Hall) there's another dry and smart personality for the story to add some needed spice. But in the final epilogue of the story, the place along the lines of Gov. Jack Hathaway attempting to play 'Hero' and getting caught, to the investigation with Mr. Runyon losing steam, that it all kind of just crash landed skidding to a halt! I had lost interest at that point and others that had seen the movie were making remarks on the way out. It was a good story that was shown and shot well, but lacked a certain sustaining climactic subtext and closing. They needed to change the ending! There should have been at least one more remaining scandal with Hanson that was not found or a skeleton that could be there for later, but it just went 'f-whop!' I gave this a six out of ten due to the characters like Bridges, Oldman, Slater, Elliot, and how this was shot. Very impressive, but just seemed to finished out thin.

Going from gritty conversations between the President and multiple senators to a speech that all of a sudden invigorates its audience with inspiration makes those moments of palpability seem spurious and artificial. The characters in the film are very well developed and due to this believability in their reactions it is unbelievable that they would turn things around with such whimsical behavior. Obviously Lurie had to compromise some of his characters traits to both please the lower-brow audiences and also make the message at the end of the film more substantial. Without a happy ending the film would have been a more realistic look at what happens in politics today and how one man or women's happiness is another man or women's sorrow. The film seems to try and work for the better good, and the equality of sexes in the eyes of everyone.

There are already movies with a more political subject (JFK, Nixon,...), but somehow they have never made a movie with political back stabbing as the only subject. This movie has and to make it even a little bit more interesting, they have added a female contender for the post of Vice-President, something that hasn't even occurred in reality.When senator Laine Hanson, who once shifted from the Republican Party to the Democratic, is nominated to become the new Vice President following the death of the previous office holder, not everybody in and outside the White House is very pleased with that. President Jackson Evans has chosen her over a more qualified and popular candidate, because he wanted to leave a legacy of being the first president to have a woman in the office of vice-president. But President Evans might miss his appointment with history when suddenly an allegation - which she doesn't want to deny or approve - appears that senator Hanson had been involved in a sexual orgy as a 19 year old in college. The Republican confirmation committee chairman has leaked this information to the press, while using the press discussion as a forum to bring it into the hearings. He did this because he wanted another governor - who had become a national hero after he almost saved a young woman from a car that crashed from a bridge into the river where he had been fishing - to become the new Vice President...Before the 'grand finale' I was about to give this movie a really very high rating, probably somewhere in between 7.5/10 and 8/10. But then they had to throw in a cheap speech about how great the American nation and its people are, how their democracy will always win from the cheaters,... I can assure you, my rating suddenly plummeted. I really hated that cheap flag waving and blasé patriotism. The only reason why I didn't give this movie a very low rating, was that I liked the biggest part of the story and the acting in it. Jeff Bridges for instance was very convincing as the President, but Joan Allen and Gary Oldman did a very fine job as well.Rod Lurie is a complete stranger to me, but I admire the fact that he has written the story and directed it himself.

The film focuses on what happens behind the scenes as some republicans, lead by Gary Oldman, try to stop her getting approved. Their main weapon being a rumored sex orgy during college, used to get Allen to drop out.The fun part is to see some of the dirty dealings going on, and Bridges is good as a sort of aloof president (think of a cleaned up the Dude from the Big Lebowski). The bad parts, that in many ways outweigh the good, are among other things that the characters doesn't feel credible.The bad guy, as played by Oldman, is more of a caricature. Every other line, you expect an evil laughter and flashes of lightning outside the window. Some subtlety would have worked better here. On the other hand there's Allen's angelic character.The film portrays her as an immaculate being - she has no faults. You get irritated that she can't acknowledge the fact that she may have been involved in an orgy when she was younger. But - at the end, even this minor crack in her perfect armour is smoothed out. How? It turns out that she never did what she's being accused of. So she truly is perfect (insert deep sigh here). In case anyone should have missed this, the director finishes the film with a speech about just how wonderful this flawless woman is. To bad it didn't fit in with the film, though.The film has some technical flaws, primarily in the editing, which feels a bit shoddy and gives the film an air of being made for TV.

When Bill Clinton was President of the United States, he found himself persecuted under the Constitution by enemies who did not accept his right to be President in the first place and who granted him no leeway whatsoever. Clinton's story is clearly the model for the event depicted in 'The Contender', although in fact the film is somewhat tamer than real life. At first, it's a fascinating study into the abuse of process and how a line can be crossed between due partisanship and straightforward hatred; the fact that the hate object is a woman is an original, but sadly convincing, touch. The film loses ground somewhat towards its ending, however, with its heroine represented with increasing adulation, whereas one of the terrible but intriguing things about the Clinton story is that he really wasn't a very nice man. The film also makes her a liberal hero in a way that is sadly unlikely in real life. And what's completely absent from the film is any anger at the fact that the best liberal hero that Hollywood can invent is the daughter of a Governor, raised in privilege and educated at the Ivy League the sense of disconnection of the whole political class from the lives of ordinary Americans is not represented at all. Much as I detest the Republican leadership, the people may be the fault of the system rather than vice versa. But even a liberal film dare must eulogise, not criticise, the American dream. The ending, in keeping with this, is weak.Performances are nicely judged, especially from Gary Oldman as the Republican leader. This is an entertaining and intriguing film; just not a particularly political one.

Great cast, well acted, sharp script, good cinematography; it seems these are not enough to ensure success these days. No Oscar nominations? I've read lots of comments from viewers about its 'liberal' views, but seen from this side of the pond, we think the US is undisputable ALL right wing, whoever is in power. The McCarthyist leanings displayed by Gary Oldman's inquisition can only be seen as a reflection of what really happened in the US and could happen again. I know that The West Wing is an alternative universe version of the US, but we all would like it to be true. The saddest thing is that Britain has been sucked into a vortex of radical conservatism following US coat tails. But we can't produce TV or movies of the quality of the best US output. And no one here writes closing speeches like that of the president played by the chronically underrated Jeff Bridges. Please, Rod Lurie, keep up the good work.

With The Contender, writer/director Rod Lurie made the mistake of either not trusting his mostly excellent writing, or underestimating the intelligence of his audience. Several key speeches are cheapened by the crescendo of stirring and intrusive music. In these scenes, Mr. Lurie penned some admittedly very partisan, but nevertheless convincing political rhetoric for his characters to speak, then inexplicably second-guessed the effect that his words, beautifully delivered, could have had on their own. It's disheartening to think one has to rely on Pavlovian response to a swelling, triumphant (and largely generic) score to get a point across, especially when the point has been more than adequately made. (insert inspiring music here)I wouldn't be so upset if the movie had not otherwise gotten 'this close' to getting it right. And here are some of the elements that were very, very rightThe plot (which has been summarized in more detail in other reviews posted here) -- it is an interesting study of a political candidate being confronted by a sordid event in her past. In these times of increasingly negative American political campaigns, this story is unfortunately all too relevant.Gary Oldman -- as the opposing Senator. The character was well-written as a savvy politician, staunchly conservative but not some kind of two-dimensional right-wing nut case. It was so refreshing to see Mr. Oldman portray a nemesis who was not frothing at the mouth, but rather subtly underplayed with all the skill that we haven't gotten to see from him in some time. This is the type of performance that we have all known he was capable of delivering AGAIN, despite the scenery-chewing of some of his more, shall we say, blockbuster roles (you know, like that One. With the President. On the airplane.) Give him good writing and he is one of the best there is.Joan Allen -- I have never seen Joan Allen be anything less than excellent and this was another shining example. A well-deserved Oscar nomination. Enough said. Jeff Bridges -- Another fine performance, as the President in a relatively small role. As for the rest of the cast, there wasn't a bad one in the bunch, to a man (and woman) delivering solid, subtle performances that could make me forget I was watching a movie. At least until that music started up again...Finally, let me admit that I wouldn't even know how to BEGIN making a movie, and Mr. Lurie has done a fine job here. Maybe a bad experience at a test screening prompted the decision to strengthen these scenes, I don't know. I look forward to his next film, and hope that he trusts his instincts and considerable talent when that time comes.

To see it sink so embarrassingly low was even more enraging in light of this promising start.'The Contender' pushes an extremely liberal agenda, which did not bother me in the least. Its hypocritical and manipulative nature, on the other hand, most definitely did.So, let's get right into it....About 4/5 of the film are spent drilling our heads with the notion of Senator Laine Hanson's sex life, past or present, being nobody's business but her own. No problem there! Either publicly or even privately behind closed doors with presidential staff (that's 100% on her side, by the way) this VP designate awaiting congressional confirmation refuses to address allegations of involvement in a wild group sex orgy during her college days, because it is, as she continually insists, beneath her dignity and against her principles to discuss such matters. Fair enough, again!While she continues refusing to acknowledge sexual past as an issue in her quest to become Vice President, preferring instead to focus on healthcare, education, foreign policy, etc. - the director Rod Lurie uses every visual and storytelling trick in the book to convince us that the allegations are true (short of stating it explicitly). Consider a scene near the beginning when Laine, after a hard day' work, comes home to her husband (also involved in politics as his wife's advisor and her former senatorial campaign manager) who informs her of the separate background check, outside of the one conducted by FBI. This secret investigation headed by Republican Congressman Shelley Runyon (Gary Oldman) went deeper than the FBI's, managing to unearth the sex story.What is her reaction upon seeing a file containing incriminating photos dug up by Runyon's people that were handed to her side by one of Congressman's assistants who had a sudden change of heart and didn't want to participate any further in this character assassination?Well, she slumps in a chair looking defeated. She clutches her forehead and flashbacks of the college gangbang start to roll as memories from the past. Knowing what we know by the end about what she already knows at the time, would you not say this scene is wildly misconstrued, manipulative and unnatural? I would.Still, this is all pretty much fine & dandy. Deliberately misleading your audience in order to build up drama is a legitimate directorial technique. Granted, it's more suited for an Agatha Christie frivolous whodunit than for something pretending to be a serious political thriller.Even if you let that one slide, reasoning 'OK, the director played with us a little to underscore just how irrelevant these allegations are'; then why was the scene on the White House lawn (Laine and President talking and smoking cigars - cigars, get it, wink, wink, Clinton, nudge, nudge, Monica - while a banquet is going on inside) included in the movie when it goes against every single idea argued for up to that point?Well, it's there because these hypocritical filmmakers aren't brave enough to stick to their guns. They feel a need to exonerate Sen. Hanson in the eyes of the audience despite the fact they just spent majority of their film convincing us how that is precisely something which doesn't need doing - either by her or by anyone else. To make it more plausible, their conversation is set up as a private exchange between Laine and Jackson as opposed to VP and President or Senator and President!? Yeah right, she's seeing this guy for like the 4th time in her life at this point and she's going to spill her guts in front of him over a stogie, even after vehemently refusing to utter a word on the topic in face of unspeakable media and peer pressure. The filmmakers obviously realized how inconsistent and out of place her behaviour in this key scene is, so they furnished her with a cheesy line to the effect of Well. OK, you win Mr. President. There is just something about almost puking on a cigar that gets a girl to open up before she clarifies every single detail of the orgy for him and more importantly FOR US.I mean pleeeease! As that great 20th century thinker and philosopher Judge Judy would say - don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining. It is painfully obvious the only aim of this unnatural scene is to have the audience NOT go home thinking Senator, and soon to be VP, Laine Hanson used to be a whore of Paris Hilton proportions. And all this after one of the movie's main points is that it wouldn't make her any less fit for vice presidential duties even if she was.Gutless and pathetic!!!No wonder Gary Oldman distanced himself from such contriving garbage.Towards the end, things, amazingly, go from bad to even worse with President Evans barging in triumphantly on a congressional sitting to deliver a ridiculous speech that touches on issues of privacy and women's rights. What was set up to be the film's culmination comes off as one of the most cringe-inducing and embarrassing scenes in recent American cinematic history. Parts of that diatribe must have been lifted straight from Clinton administration speechwriters' rough drafts.As icing on the cake, before closing credits we get a fade to black screen with words 'For our daughters', by which time I was reaching for something to puke in. And I wasn't even smoking a cigar. "},{"Title":"Don't bother to watch this film!

Perhaps that's the gold ring they were reaching for. The plot concerns a woman senator who is picked by the President to succeed as Vice President, owing to an occupancy in that office.*SPOILERS AHEAD*First, Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) is an ATHIEST. How an avowed, and publicly declared athiest could ever get elected to the Senate is never mentioned, as it could never happen. This is just the first incredily inept plot point that is never explained.Second, the main plot centers around a supposed orgy in which Senator Hanson was supposed to have engaged in during her college years. Sen. Hanson's father was (if memory serves) a Supreme Court Justice. So how the heck did his daughter's involvement in an orgy during college remain a secret throughout his political career and how did it not come up during her rise to politics? Did she apply for the Senate and get the job without a background check or an election? How also did the voters overlook the fact that Laine Hanson started dating her campaign manager and when his marriage broke up (during the campaign) married him. What state was she from? The state of unconciousness?Third, another politico, played by William Peterson, decides to up his profile by having a woman pretend to get in an accident, driving her car off a bridge intentionally, down 15 feet into a river, where Peterson will conveniently be fishing, and see her 'accident' so that he can rescue her and be a big hero for the papers. That the woman is Peterson's girlfriend on the side and he wants her silenced (and therefor, he fails to 'rescue' her) is visible from a LONG way off. But even if he was true to her - what person in their right mind, with no stunt training, equipment, or practice, would drive their car off a bridge into a river? The chance of serious injury or death is so incredibly high, and the natural tendancy of the human mind to protect one's self so great, that this could never really occur.Fourth, Senator BadGuy, played by Gary Oldman, is the one who's sinister visage leers out at you from the cover of the DVD. He's the one who manages to find out about Hanson's college romp and brings it to the public eye. Perhaps dismayed at her switching from Republican to Democrat, he sets out to destroy her with the knowledge of her past.Meanwhile, President Evans - played by Jeff Bridges - seems to spend his days figuring out interesting new sandwiches for the White House staff to make for him. When he counsels Senator Hanson, he treats her more as a woman he's dating, than as a President should talk/act toward his potential successor. Makes you wonder why he wanted her as Vice President. Other than those two things, Evans seems to have nothing more to do, and we're left wondering what this president would do in a time of international crisis.That the sexual escapade turns out to be a non-issue - the actual woman seen in pictures in a three way turns out to be someone else, is just another failing in a fault-ridden script that has no idea what it's doing. So why didn't Senator Hanson give out immediately the information that she was innocent of the charges and could prove it was someone else? Why would a dedicated member of the United States Senate allow millions of dollars of taxpayers money be wasted when she knew she could easily settle the matter and get on with her ratification as Vice President?For that matter, how did an athiest get to be Senator? Why didn't her college escapade come to light earlier? Why didn't anyone protest her stealing her campaign manager from his wife?And mostly - why did they even greenlight this script?

It's a fine cast.**SPOILERS**My only real complaint with the movie concerns the plot and how we're given a muddled message about the role of women's lib.  The senator is attacked at the hearings over photos taken of a frat house orgy where it appears she was the main attraction.  Her defense is to refuse to talk about her personal life.  She takes this position in the committee room and on a television talk show.  She claims it's nobody's business and that the issue would never have come up if she were a man who'd had sex with multiple female partners.Fine, this is a perfectly understandable position to take, if you're guilty as charged.  Politics shouldn't focus on personal issues and there shouldn't be a dual standard for men and women.  But the problem for me was that it turned out she was innocent, that the woman in the photographs was someone who looked like her - she could prove it because she has a birthmark on her thigh and the woman in the pictures doesn't.  The people who testified against her were relying on faulty memory; they were remembering the rumors that had gone around and not the facts.The Senator could have really slammed the door on her opposition by letting them crawl out on a limb and chopping it off.  Instead, she refuses to talk about it and gets pummelled.  The defense is left up to the president, who finds out the truth after a heart-to-heart talk with her.  She withdraws her name from consideration and asks that he not reveal why. The President addresses Congress and tears into Gary Oldman's character.  He laments that politics has gotten too personal and has strayed from the real business of governance, and then announces he won't accept the senator's offer to withdraw.  Standing ovation.  Cut to scene of Joan Allen gleefully throwing herself into her husband's arms.The female senator didn't save herself or even fight very much in her defense.  It was up to the male president to do that, and that's what I mean by this movie presenting a mixed message on women's lib.  They had the opportunity to make Joan Allen a much stronger character, and they took the easy way out.   A minor point to some since the story is still interesting, but an annoying flaw nonetheless.

The vp candidate had supposedly once been a Republican, but gives her positions on several issues, and they were so wildly liberal they would have caused Democrats to blush.  Her positions were farther left than would be tolerated from a vp.  She called her self a atheist who considered government her church.  Yikes.  Don't see too many candidates running on that.

Its dedication to `our daughters' underscores this misinterpretation.  On analysis and reflection, however, the message even more fundamentally is not about gender equality in the degrading-behavior sweepstakes.  It is this very destructive idea that publicized sexual indiscretions of a candidate, whether male or female, are irrelevant to character and worthiness to serve in public office-a bad idea indeed.

The acting and direction were very good, but the screenplay tries so hard to push an envelope that does not exist. It forgets that all politicians are, by nature, deceptive; this movie assumes only half of them are.It looks for every possible stereotypical flaw in the Republican party while exposing every possible stereotypical virtue of the Democratic party. There are no moderates, only extremists who hide in the shadows of intrigue. Clearly it was produced by Hollywood to seek revenge for the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and in the process it looks to smear any conservative value.Not that it matters, but I'm more liberal than conservative and hold no political party affiliation. However, I prefer realism in political dramas, and this movie does not give it. Instead, it creates a fabricated Democratic utopia where the female candidate is too good to simply point out that she has a birthmark not present in the scandalous photos, while in reality ignoring that she could never survive past her comments that she is an athiest and wants all guns removed from American homes (just speaking from objective perception of disregard for the constitution, not personal preference for guns).It is still somewhat entertaining to watch just for the performances, and the concluding speech by the president would be wonderful if any president could ever have that kind of intestinal fortitude.

The main message don't fight back as the political game is wrong. Perhaps if more of our own politicians would stick to their principles and not play political games, we would live in a better world.Laine Hansen (Allen), a senator from Ohio, is selected to fill the vacancy of Vice President by a lame duck president (Bridges). Despite opposition across the aisle (and some quieter opposition from the President's own party), Hansen refuses to answer potentially embarrassing personal questions about her past. These issues are publicized and pushed into the focus by the House panel considering her confirmation, led by Congressman Runyon (Oldman). Despite things looking grim, the President continues his support for Hansen and her decision not to answer these questions.The messages? Women should be treated the same as men (the fact that a man would not be similarly criticized for having several sexual partners is mentioned repeatedly). Personal issues should be off limits. The political game is manipulative. All of these messages have been voiced before, but perhaps not at the same time and certainly not in this manner. All in all, it makes for a good story. But some of the quieter (even one-liner) messages are quite tiring. Liberal Hollywood is at it again, inserting its agenda...How so? Surprise surprise we have a Democratic president and it's the Republicans (led by Oldman's character) who are the bad guys. Is it just me, or are 95% of the good guys in political movies Democrats (especially when ideology is an issue). Several controversial issues are framed in a way that makes Hansen's position look undeniably right. For instance a woman has a right to choose, abortion is not a constitutional issue (and the Supreme Court has no right to examine it), a woman has a right and duty to take maternity leave (pretty noncontroversial, right?) AND it should be paid leave (huh!?) Many of her positions (advocating atheism, etc.) are very unpopular ones, and most of them are, at best controversial. Yet we are led to believe she is the hero and therefore (at least casually) told that her positions are the right and just ones. While this type of mild and subtle propoganda is unsettling, it's certainly not unique in entertainment. It's just getting old and annoying seeing nothing but liberal ideology touted by Hollywood.The performances are quite good. Allen gives a quality, understated performance. Oldman is fantastic as usual (look at that make up job, I didn't even know it was him until I saw the end credits!). Jeff Bridges is OK as the President (I'm not a huge fan of his work, but he is dignified, at least), although his closing speech is hokey and awkward, and he certainly doesn't have Presidential poise in that sequence.Overall, a good watchable movie.

It was coined, as you recall, back in 1998, when people began to wonder if the president's sexual indiscretions qualified as `high crimes and misdemeanors.'  The Contender, which manages to avoid the overworked clichés about Bill and Monica , is an enthralling political drama about the subject.  It deserves to be categorized in the same class as All the President's Men and The Candidate.The central issue is the President's choice for Vice President.  We don't know why he must pick a second in command.  One assumes that the former Vice President died while in office.  But that's not the point.  It doesn't matter.  The selection process, subject to Senate confirmation, is merely the vehicle through which competing ideologies are brought together as adversaries.His choice is not a popular New Hampshire Governor named Jack Hathaway, lionized in the media as a hero &#150; by all measures the `safe' choice. Instead, against the advice of his aides, he chooses Ohio Senator Laine Hanson, an American blue-blood Wellesley graduate who has, some claim, a checkered past.  It's to be the `swansong' of an outgoing President.  And so the battle ensues.Fortunately, The Contender is not your typical Hollywood production.  It has no cheesy `action' scenes.  The sexual content (an orgy) serves the story, and not vice versa.  The language, though strong, is entirely appropriate  it's a violent movie;  but, the violence is verbal.  And the story is brought to a high level of dramatic intensity through a perfect combination of utterly engaging dialogue, together with some extraordinary acting.  Most important of all, the main characters evolve.  They are transformed, for better or worse, as the drama unfolds.  But that's not all as viewer, you perceptions evolve along with the movie.  You're put in a position where you have to make character judgments.  And at the end of the movie, your own judgments are put to the test.

She has a certain gravity and presence as a serious person.  Here, she refuses to concede anything on her personal privacy, in this case on sexual morality.  Therefore, despite the overwhelming and outrageous innuendo against her, she's seen sticking to her guns, refusing to say a word on the matter to Congress.

She must be innocent, surely?Gay Oldman is convincing, as usual, though here beginning to live up to his name.  He looks older than his 42 years.  He excels at those little nuances of expression that are the hallmark of any person who sits on a committee. Good American accent, too.The script (Rod Lurie) is excellent, in some places, too.

The President (Jeff Bridges) needs a replacement.  The shoe-in would appear to be Governor Hathaway (William Petersen), a war hero adored by politicians, public and media -  but the President has other ideas.  He wants to give the post to a woman Senator Laine Hanson(Joan Allen).  He wants a change in the body politik of America.  And he knows it's not going to be easy. The Contender's premise is, in itself, something of a curate's egg in that it deals ostensibly not so much with contenders but with pre-selected people and further still, it is for the hardly coveted position of vice-president - a job that no-one need be assassinated for!.  But then - this isn't really what the movie's about.  No, this is a 'what if' film What if a woman rose to a position of potential supreme power in the good ol' US of?  And, as such, it's an interesting diversion.Now, writing as a British left-winger (I mean, are Democrats really left wing!?) even I could see the bias in this movie.  The right is represented (almost solely) by the figure of Republican, Shelley Runyon (Gary Oldman) and despite Oldman's typically skilled and mannered performance, the character is thinly one-dimensional and myopically vindictive; factors which question how he rose to the prominence he appears to enjoy in his party.  One suspects - knowing Oldman's leftist leanings and the fact that he was co-producer - that he over-relished presenting the right as a band of intellectual fascists and somewhat over-egged his cake in the process. Despite this major flaw (and a collection of tenuous narrative and plot developments) the film serves it's central premise pretty well.  As a hypothetical diatribe on what might befall a female who could become the President of the world's most influential country, it hits the mark with a series of vignettes in which no holds are barred (the abortion question during the hearing is a particularly vicious example).  The performance of Allen is a boost in this argument too.  She has consistently been the best screen actress in America over the last half decade and she displays an inner integrity which serves her character well here.  Indeed, on the whole, the acting is first rate.  Bridge's maverick, laid back President might be Lebowski with a shave in the oval office - but it's charming and disarming in equal measure.  And PLEASE don't allow yourself to be kidded by the belief that Kennedy, Clinton and Dubya didn't/don't behave in some or most part like this.  Elliot, Petersen and notably Slater as an underwritten 'youthful conscience' all give solid support and it is really as an ensemble piece that this project scores.As a thriller, however, it is flawed and eventually far-fetched and too many loose ends are tied up in a clinically convenient fashion.  But it's intriguing never the less.  And it's central argument - that a woman standing for vice-president would be given nothing short of a torrid time by the chauvinist, patriarchal politicians of the States (beware, Hilary) - is surely strongly founded indeed!

That Jeff Bridges, playing the US President, and reminding more of his role as The Great Lebowsky even got an award nod for this is no less than ASTONISHING.  But there is where we are left by the so-called voting public.On the other hand, Gary Oldman himself, playing the role of a devious congressional leader is brilliant, but the look he adopted for himself in this film (being far too reminiscent of one Very Well Known Hollywood Director in actuality) was not only pompous but downright absurd and distractive.  Joan Allen on the other hand provides an excellent performance in a soggy role; the audience is left wondering just exactly WHERE has this female politician come from (in every sense, both literally and figuratively), for most of the film until a rather surprising (and thrilling) climax, which frankly raised the film back into the realm of respectability.  As to the rest, Sam Elliot does a decent job of an LBJ-esque character on the White House staff while Christian Slater is... well, Christian Slater no different really than the role as the inquisitive reporter in the film version of Anne Rice´s Interview with the Vampire eight years ago.Sadly for Joan Allen, a great performance was wasted as this role had no way of going anywhere but down hill.  Still, she and Gary Oldman were both thrilling at times, especially in the one-on-one, seemingly good vs. evil clash that ensues.  Gary Oldman is gaining a reputation for playing fiends which will probably go far in explaining why he is growing more interested in film production in direction type-set, is putting it mildly.Entertainment value, wait for the video and let someone else rent it.

Joan Allen could have been a true dignified hero if she hadn't recited that silly speech declaring herself a proud atheist, liar, betrayer, and adulterer.  The writer/director tried desperately to make the movie a symbol of feminism, but he resulted in being sexist himself by having his female characters recite those silly speeches that only a man could write.  That was the final nail in the coffin.All in all, a great movie with serious flaws.  With some careful realistic editing it can be salvaged.

Almost immediately following the impeachment of President Clinton, writer/director Ron Lurie went to work on the script.  In a nutshell, we get the familiar story of a Washington sex scandal (involving a female democratic Vice Presidential nominee) full of circumstantial evidence, obscured truths, infidelity, partisanship and colorful characters.  Jeff Bridges portrays the U.S. President Jackson Evans, Gary Oldman plays the sleazy GOP Congressman Shelly Runyon, and Vice President nominee Laine Hanson is brought to life by Joan Allen It would be a notorious understatement to say that releasing this film three weeks before a presidential election was a well thought-out move by left-wing Hollywood.  The film, completed months ago, was obviously saved until this crucial political event in order to do damage to the GOP campaign.  The portrayal of all Republicans as sinister McCarthy-ists and all Democrats as upstanding humanitarian patriots (despite their own personal behavior) puts this film comfortably in the category of propaganda. That said, It was still a very good movie. From appearances as Sid Vicious to Beethoven to Dracula, Gary Oldman is one of the greatest character actors of all time.  This quality comes out in his incredible performance as the sleazy, manipulative Republican congressman bent on keeping Hanson out of office.  Oldman, hiding his British accent flawlessly, brings believability to the stereotyped role before him. I was worried about seeing Bridges in the role of the President of the United States, afraid I would be unable to separate him from past roles such as `The Dude' in `The Big Lebowski.'  I consoled myself with the thought, `Well, it's not like he's going to be bowling or eating a lot.'  Wrong on both counts.  He ended up being a slightly more motivated version of `The Dude,' this time in a suit. Allen has received critical praise left and right (though mostly left) for her performance, and rightfully so.  Hitherto known as a supporting actress, Allen slips so comfortably into the role that we forget she's giving a performance.  In fact, Lurie states in several press releases that the role of Senator Laine Hanson was written specifically for Allen.  I'm not complaining; she pulled it off without a hitch. Other notable characters include Christian Slater as a young Jedi congressman who, once a Democrat, begins to lose himself to the dark side. Sam Elliot (who, oddly enough, played `The Stranger' in `The Big Lebowski' with Bridges) plays Chief of Something-or-Other Kermit Newman, and has a difficult time shaking his long-standing cowboy persona.I don't recall much of a soundtrack, which usually means it complemented the movie well without standing out and calling attention to itself.  The helicopter shots of Capitol Hill are standbys, but not used gratuitously. The sets constructed for the film, especially the room where the GOP's committee hearings are held, are memorable and tasteful.  `The Contender,' overall,  was nice to look at. Apart from some implausible plot developments and a character here or there that appeared to be out of place, Lurie pulls off his retaliation film effectively.  I'll be surprised if it doesn't have the effect that was obviously intended.  While the motivations behind the film remain questionable, `The Contender' makes you think just enough to start an argument during the drive home.

Jeff Bridges headlines a cast in a that includes the immense star power as Joan Allen, Sam Elliott, Christian Slater, William Peterson and Gary Oldman. With the cast assembled in The Contender nobody will go home disappointed as they deliver the best performances of their careers.Though the plot is nothing new, it should be overlooked by the great performances and quality of the script. The Contender surrounds the confirmation hearings of a potential vice-presidential nominee. Bridges performance as the president of the United States is one of the best since it is believable and delivered with ease. Except for Michael Douglas in The American President and Harrison Ford in Air Force One, Bridges is the best suited and believable actor to portray the president. Qualities such as the style, charm and charisma are present in each scene. The Contender is unlike any movie I've seen this year that has a rich and quality script that is backed by the performances of its cast. It is laced with rich and quality performances.Joan Allen brings her fire and spunk to the movie as she won't back down from any fight as well as hold true to her convictions. With her role, Allen has shown she has the ability to carry a movie and portray her character with zeal and conviction.I was so glad Christian Slater back on screen. He has always been an actor viewers can depend on to give 110 percent so when he was cast in this film; I knew it would be extra special. After watching this movie, I can make one guarantee; he doesn't disappoint with the performance he gives as a politician on the rise who will do anything to advance his career.Gary Oldman turned in his greatest performance in The Contender as Shelly Runyon. Every time you see Oldman's name flash across the screen you can almost smell the scent of evil as well as a successful film because he is so convincingly good. Oldman, who usually plays the villain role, plays the spoiler role for Bridges and Allen. Runyon will do anything to keep Allen's character out of the white house; this includes digging into her past. Oldman gives a performance that is so memorable it deserves an oscar nomination.There are 6 good quality movies that I have seen this year; they include Frequency, The Perfect Storm, The Patriot, Rules Of Engagement, Where The Heart Is and Pay It Forward. We should make it 7 with The Contender.I have one piece of advice for every movie fan; if you have two hours to spare on a Friday or Saturday night, I URGE YOU TO SEE THE CONTENDER.

Furthermore, both Oldman and Bridges deliver one of the best roles of their respective careers. Bridges airs class and respectability with a seemingly casual ease while Oldman is fittingly terrific as a driven, ruthless rightwing representative. Joan Allen's main character was interesting but it paled in comparison to the aforementioned heavyweights. But my only real disappointment lies in the fact that the writers did not follow through to the end.

The problem with the film is its shallow, hamfisted approach.

The script is also let down by blind faith in bureaucracy and the American way, and a binary concept of good and evil not out of place in a Star Wars movie.  I'm told the director is English, but there is no sense of irony in the film, so maybe the Hollywood fatcats chopped it up.  Gary Oldman (also producer) has complained that the post-production editing and score removed all ambiguity from his character and performance, so something seems to have been changed.  The direction also is generally intelligent save for a few George Lucas touches (such as Joan Allen -unquestionably the 'goody' of the film- dressed ALL in white, jogging, for some reason, amongst the white tombstones of American soldiers).

Thorough-out the film, it is the men who decide everything.The basic value championed by this film is Hollywood's way of resolving the sexual double standard -- that, since men so often act like animals, it is acceptable for women to do so as well.  Such thinking represents, at best, a grotesque non sequitir.  Couldn't we see a few more films that suggested that, perhaps, men have it wrong here about their own behavior?  That perhaps men shouldn't be sexually promiscuous?An implicit presumption of this film is that, were the Internet to present what seemed to be photos of a male politician engaged in a sexual menage-a-trois, this wouldn't prevent his confirmation as a replacement Vice President.  In the real world, this proposition would be challenged by someone, and falsified by events.While the principal character acts on the courage of her convictions (well-founded or not), the writer doesn't have that courage.  The character conceals from the world whether the tale of her indiscretion is true; but the writer tells the audience that she is in fact innocent.  What we're getting here isn't reason and principle; what we're getting here is manipulation.The film cheats in pushing other values as well.  One side in the abortion debate as represented as a group of shouting hypocrites, while the other is represented as recognizing a principle that ostensibly transcends any judicial consideration! (I wonder how a court is to rule that it isn't allowed to make any ruling on this matter!) Adultery is trivialized without real consideration of that trivialization.  And so forth.Further, the Republican Party is attacked according to the formula that is was a fine thing until just the last few years.

Rarely have I been so touched by a movie that I felt compelled to write a review on an airplane.  `The Contender' is one such film.I call it a fable because, sadly enough, no such person as Senator Laine Hanson (superbly portrayed by the ever dignified Joan Allen) would possibly exist in our political reality.  The film tells the story of the senator's confirmation to the office of the Vice Presidency after the aborted term (due to death) of the sitting V.P.  Driven by his desire to leave the legacy of ushering into office America's first female veep, the President (Jeff Bridges, in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance) picked Hanson over a national hero, Governor Hathaway.  Naturally, her gender became a point of contention.  Leading the confirmation hearing, Senator Runyon (performed with surprising restraint by Gary Oldman) dug up a sexual episode from the senator's past as moral grounds to deny her the office.  Throughout the hearings, Hanson staunchly refused to comment on the allegations, even as the controversy threatened to collapse her political and personal future.The plot may seem like a thinly veiled re-telling of the Clinton scandals &#150; or, if your memory stretches back far enough, the Clarence Thomas / Anita Hill hearings.  In many ways it was.  The movie bravely made no attempt to make ambiguous which political party each character belonged to (unlike `The American President').  It plainly cast the Republicans as the executer of `sexual McCarthyism' and the self-proclaimed moral authority, and the Democrats as being the offenders of common moral standards (as seen in Hanson's adulterous relationship and Hathaway's staged accident).A post-Clinton knock is far from what `The Contender' is about, however. It extolled the virtues of - and made plain the hardship in - maintaining one's principles.  Unlike most real-life political figures, Joan Allen's character `denied to comment' not because the allegations were true (they were not), but because she did not want to turn the exploitation of private matters into an approved political tactic.  In the end, she chose to withdraw her candidacy rather than making public papers that would have exonerated her and embarrassed Senator Runyon.  Her actions moved the President to do a Schindler-isque change from hardened political opportunist to an awakened idealist.  His speech to a joint session of the Senate and the House at the end of the movie was particularly moving&#133; until the very Hollywood standing ovation from the floor.The film made the message easy to swallow by avoiding formulaic heroes and villains.  The main antagonist, Senator Runyon, was cherished by his wife for having championed hate crime bills.  Our heroine, Senator Hanson, was revealed to have participated in an adulterous relationship with her current husband while he was still married to Hanson's college friend.  In Christian Slater's junior Congressman Webster character, we see hope for the future. Although Webster also opposed Hanson's candidacy, he turned into an ally when he, too, decided principle rides higher than personal goals.I think `The Contender' affected me so much because Hanson's character embodied what I want to be, as well as what I feel all who hold power should be.  Hanson was willing to sacrifice her career and name for a principle she found worthwhile.  The story should give everyone something to strive for, especially the politicians for whom this movie would best benefit.

A difficult premise, a woman with a dark past has the opportunity to become vice president of the United States. Joan Allen brings freshness, intelligence, dignity and honour to the role.  You are rooting for her all the way. Jeff Bridges excels in his role as president. Reminiscent of LBJ in his homespun jocularity but underneath you sense the man of iron and intelligence.  A great performance.  Supporting cast are brilliant as well, Saul Rubinek and particularly Gary Oldman whom I did not recognise, he just dove into the part and did not come up for air. The only flaw I see is the rally-around-the-flag-boys type ending, so very preachy with the cheers of democracy once more rising to the rafters and the bad guy skulking from the room. Oh spare me. It did not really match the tone of the movie at all and it diminished Laine Hansen(Joan Allen) considerably from her position of honourable strength.  A man was still deciding her future.

He's so thrilled that he can get a shark sandwich or hazelnut pudding on a moment's notice that he seems more buffoonish than presidential.  This schtick is just played out too much, too often.  The same way, Allen's character, Laine Hanson, is also too long-suffering and tight-lipped, for too long.  Since it was written for Ms Allen, the writer might have been so in love with everything she does that he was blind to how repetitious such a performance could be.  I don't know whether it's the script or the director (wait! the director wrote it!) that imposed such one-dimensionality on these characters.  However, all the actors do a great job in spite of it.  Gary Oldman especially breaks out of the box he's put in.On the whole, it's a very good political movie, with an interesting surprise.   In my opinion, it went on a bit too long with the insistence to not discuss the accusations, until the surprise.  If it had been 20 minutes shorter, it would have been easier to take.  And it's really hard to believe that any candidate in our current political climate either would, or could even survive without directly addressing such defamations.  And, surely, after the testimony of Mariel Hemingway, the senator's boat would have been sunk if it were real.  The DVD shows some scenes that were cut, legitimately.   Since they didn't show her father's press conference, it makes me wonder why he was in the movie at all.  Likewise, I would have cut out everything with Runyon's wife since they don't affect the plot.  But I would have re-included the scene where Jerry got fired for suggesting they would back Hathaway.  I was surprised, while watching the film, that this wasn't addressed.I loved the speech the president gives at the end, not because it fits the movie all that well, but the sentiments expressed, especially the quote by Napoleon.Anyway, it's not perfect, but a good movie with very good performances.

To those that claimed conservatives were not likely to enjoy this, I have to argue the point.  Center stage is given to one political issue that can and should be backed by all whether they lean to the left or right.  Sure other issues are touched on along the way, but it's a film about the world of politics - politicians have views. I certainly don't agree with them all, but that's the reality of it. This movie would have lost much of it's strength if the character's dialog had been watered down in an effort not to offend anyones political views.  Sadly you are missing the point and a great entertaining and again I say satisfying moment if you get stuck criticizing each political view presented.This is not a heavy documentary or historical piece that need be torn apart for it's realism or accuracy, but rather a gripping story making an excellent point about what should be up for discussion and what should not.As for the reviewer that suggested a similarity between the courageous, principled Senator who became the victim in this story and Hilary Clinton I just have to say that once you get past their outstanding fashion sense, that is where all similarity between them ends.

For instance, like what you hear the character Shelly Runyon spew in The Contender. Also, as a Christian I am really getting tired of the consistently negative portrayal of religion by Hollywood - that portrays _anyone_ who has moral values as a hypocrite witch burner. It is no accident that the antagonist in the film, Shelly Runyon is a pro-life Republican and the protagonist is an enlightened atheist female - this fits right in with the perennial left leaning politics of Hollywood that they try to force down our collective throat every now and again. It doesn't seem to matter that the films seldom do well in the box office &#150; this is just more evidence of the left leaning Hollywood community makes product like this to exercise their political conceit and nothing more.The film itself has some pretty implausible political premises - like how are we supposed to believe this person Laine Hanson was a recent Republican (the film claims the character was a Republican House member prior to joining the Senate as a Deom)? Puh-lease. The only view that this character shared with Republicans was a vote in favor of impeachment of Pres. Clinton. The rest of her views shared in the committee were right out of the Democratic Party Platform. How many Republicans are there that advocate outlawing firearms? These plot contrivances are obviously a thin, halfhearted attempt to establish fairness in an obviously biased film.There were some fun parts of the film - like Jeff Bridges portrayal of the President and the way he loves to show off that he can have the White House kitchen whip up anything and everything in a minutes notice 24/7, like an order of Kung Pow chicken made with Walnuts instead of peanuts in the middle of the night. Regardless of the writing, Gary Oldman's rendering of Shelly Runyon was genius. Sam Elliot's Kermit Newman was a treat to watch. Also, a favorite underutilized actor of mine, William L. Petersen, did a fabulous job as the crooked Governor. None of these aspects was enough to overcome a weak premise and a biased script, however.If you are a regular reader of Salon.com and buy into this anti-conservative anti-religious line of thought emanating from HollyLeft, you'll probably like this film. If you are a fair minded person of any political persuasion who knows anything about real politicians you will probably join me in giving this film the raspberry it so richly deserves.

She looks so much like Hillary Clinton - wouldn't it be wonderful if Hillary was as virtuous as Laine? Maybe she is. I mean, what do we really know about Hillary? For all we truly know, which probably isn't much, isn't nearly as close to the truth as it should be, this film may actually be about Hillary. But, as this film so eloquently reveals, it doesn't matter what we, the public, know about our public figures and political representatives as long as we, and they, share beliefs in the right things such as freedom of choice, gender etc. equality, human dignity and the right to keep our human frailty and indiscretion private.After a story such as this has been told, you should have this question in your mind What is it that causes so many human beings to be fascinated by and to wallow joyfully at learning of other people's questionable behavior? One might answer simply it is curiosity, or it makes some people feel better about their own frailty to know that others are also not perfect. But, unfortunately, these answers only apply to a small minority of interested parties. The vast majority of National Enquirer readers and Jerry Springer fans, and there are multitudes upon multitudes of this breed of human, are present for the show because they are ignorant and ruthlessly mean people. Read it and weep, folks, but it shouldn't surprise anyone that the human race has evolved little during the past millennium, since the Dark Ages. For 1000 years is, after all, but a sliver of time in evolutionary terms (hundreds of thousands - millions of years). This movie and all similar tales (and real life drama) are therefore but examples of the sadistic ability of our race - just how far we are still capable of behaving ruthlessly.Take note, if you will, of the hero Hanson, those frail souls within her circle of protection her husband and son, and the one she vainly attempts to protect the woman (Mariel Hemingway character) whose husband she had an affair with and eventually married. All the rest of the characters are ruthless. Yet certain of these ruthless characters are eventually heroic, too. By the way, when a writer and/or director gives us ruthless characters with courage and integrity to fight for the weak and suppressed, we are treated to a dichotomy that is rich with humaneness. As Shakespeare fans know, there is no greater demonstration of fine drama. This story is indeed Shakespearian in depth of morality and richness of plot, if weaker in style - the latter fault not its own device but rather a victim of its environment and time (remember, Shakespeare was also contemporary in his time, also a victim to some extent of the trappings of his contemporary language etc.).I would like to say that I told you so about Jeff Bridges. I've been raving about his choice of films during the last decade; always intelligent, always controversial, always with that mark above the herd that Oscar Wilde's sad legacy owns as the founder of what is now a tradition of intelligent rebellion to the status quo. This is an extremely important point, what should be considered a high achievement to reach. Few attain it. I think of Billy Wilder, Lenny Bruce, John Lennon.I'd love to see Bridges run for president, for real, and win. He could, you know, but probably wouldn't want to. It's too bad - we got a crummy actor and human being, Reagan, who was interested in government. Now we need a great humanitarian coupled with the charisma that actors wield which gives them the edge in the popularity contest. It would be nice, anyway.No one except me has noticed it yet, but this film is like Spielberg's Amistad. It's about overcoming bigotry; a triumph upon the issue of gender equality as opposed to racial equality in the former film. And then it goes one better by giving us not one political speech as classic closing monologue (in Amistad by Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams), but two Hanson's closing speech to the committee and Bridges' closing speech to the press. To me, it's all wonderful. Women's lib, abortion rights, homophobes, racial bigotry, etc. As was eloquently stated in Bridges' fantastic closing monologue, these are the most important issues for all Americans, past, present, future. They are what the United States of America was created for. They are its purpose. Don't get mired in the details. So the founders preached equality while owning slaves. So what? The important thing is the dream, the future, changing things to benefit our descendants. This is the truest, most integral part of the definition of the term liberal. It gives us hope, and that's about all we've got. You've got to criticize what's wrong with the world today, but you've got to do it for the right reasons, you've got to do it because you believe there could be a better world.What an incredibly beautiful, inspiring film to behold. A rare gem.

Leave your personal opinions about politics at the door, and you might enjoy this film for the gem that it is.In the beginning of the film it is revealed to the audience that the vice president has died, and the country is awaiting a decision on who will replace him.  The President, played by Jeff Bridges, wants to get a woman in office, so he chooses Senator Laine Hanson, played by Joan Allen.Meanwhile, in the Republican camp, evil senator Runyon (Gary Oldman) is gathering dirt on the unsuspecting Hanson, aided by a young misguided representative played by Christian Slater.  The film centers on the allegations that are being brought against Hanson, and how she chooses to deal with the allegations.I was absolutely enthralled throughout the entire film.  Suspense is maintained throughout, but there is no violence.  The only assassination here is of the political sort, and we the audience are drawn into this world of committee meetings, press conferences, restaurant showdowns, and political backstabbings.  Each character is played almost to perfection.  I especially enjoyed Jeff Bridges as the president who pushed food on his guests, presumably out of hospitality (or was it to keep the upper hand?).The Contender is not without its flaws.  Sometimes it comes off like a Democratic propaganda peice, pushing liberal views on the separation of church and state, abortion, capital punishment, and feminism (the dedication at the end reads For our Daughters).  The plot itself is a veiled reference to Monicagate--a pretty obvious reference, come to think of it.  But come on, people, this is Hollywood!

But her beliefs can only serve as filling (or fluff) in the movie, they don't provide the contents.And here's what's the contents look likeOnce there was ONE bad guy in Washington, I mean very bad, almost as bad as the monster under your 2-year old's bed. He used to dump buckets of muck on every good guy. But once he tried to dump a bucket on a lady, and there came this President, who was a good guy, and threw the bad guy out of the planet. And everybody in the forest,  I mean, the planet, I mean, Washington cheered and became happy and good ever after.Honestly, it seems as simplified as that. You can't really take it seriously, so even the very worthy (and unorthodox) idea that people's personal lives should be left personal as long as they don't break the law, even this very admirable idea loses its value.If the movie's title were Mission Impossible/Revision 100.01.345 all the good guy kicks the bad guy's you know what in the end junk and extra-cute-super-smart secret agent with her sugary devotion to women's cause would all belong.

The VP has died 3 weeks earlier and it is time to nominate a new one. President is played by Jeff Bridges and the evil senator expertly played by Gary Oldman. Christian Slater is the junior congressman who is idealistic.I'll mention the flaw right upfront. The author/director is an atheist and uses this film as a way of expounding on his beliefs. In scenes on the tennis court, in the hospital (deleted scenes on the DVD), and during the hearings he goes outside the normal bounds of the script to inject his atheistic views in a way that is not central to the movie, and I object to this in the same way I object to gratuitous sex or violence in movies. To me, that is NOT honest film-making.The VP confirmation is stalled by old college-days reports of a type of fraternity orgy she allegedly was in, including photos and witnesses. Her principles prevent her from dignifying the allegations with a comment, because its validity should not be relevant to her confirmation. In a private scene she coments that if she were a man, her sexual partners as a college student would not be a factor.The evil senator is determined to destroy her, by any means, because her views are opposed to his, and he simply does not think she is fit for the job as VP, or worse, eventual POTUS. So, the heart of the movie is about that struggle.A side story is about the governor who most others think is the obvious choice for VP. Turns out that he had set up a film-opening scene where a car plunges off the elevated highway into the water so that he could jump from his fishing boat, with a reporter as a witness, and save the lady passenger thus becoming a hero and a shoo-in for both the VP job and eventual POTUS. However, they screw it up and she drowns. A thorough follow-up investigation exposes this, and ultimately helps the confirmation of the female VP.Turns out that she had never been guilty of the sexual activity in college, and had her own witnesses to verify that, but she insisted that it not come up because it still should not be an issue. Principles are not really principles if you don't stick to them when it isn't convenient.I give the movie a rating of 7 of 10, and could have been better if the author/director had kept his religious views out of it.

There is a sharp script and authentic sets, but what really makes the movie is a triumvirate of fine performances. Jeff Bridges is excellent as Democratic President Jackson Evans, exhibiting the charisma of a Clinton but without any women &#150; even a wife &#150; in sight; a barely recognisable Gary Oldman fills yet another bad guy role with distinction as the hard-line Republican Shelly Runyon; and, in a role specifically written for her by Lurie, Joan Allen is superb as the nominee Laine Hanson, facing allegations of sexual misconduct with a coolness only a few degrees above her performance in `The Ice Storm'.It all becomes a little trite towards the end with some implausible plot twists and two grand-standing speeches, but one forgives this because of its uncompromising support for political liberalism and gender equality. Indeed a measure of the difference between British and American politics is that positions which are so commonplace in the former &#150; support for a woman's right to choose an abortion, opposition to the death penalty, abolition of possession of hand guns, and separation of church and state - seem so radical when espoused by Allen's character.

But its a different tune that's being whistled after a short while.  Not everyone agrees with the President that Hanson is the best choice and expected him to appoint party stalwart and governor of Virginia, Jack Hathaway, particularly as Hathaway had recently become a hero in the press after a failed attempt to save a young woman from drowning. The Chairman of the committee in Congress that will conduct the Confirmation Hearings is Republican Shelly Runyan (Gary Oldman).Runyan, is hell bent (for reasons never really fully explained) on preventing Hanson on having an easy Confirmation Hearing and gets a dirt digger in on the scheme and manages to procure photographic evidence of Hanson participating in an orgy when she was in college.  From there the hearings turn.This is an interesting film and reasonably well executed although it does go on a bit in the grandstanding speeches and some contrived moments.

My opinion is that our leaders are our worldwide representatives and it does matter. This is not a forum for my political views though. The truth of this movie is that it is a statement by the Left. It is showing Liberals as the heroes and Conservatives as mindless idiots. Joan Allens character is played with little realism. Tucks her tail and doesn't fight. Who would want this person as a leader. Not I. I would have taken he rnot fighting if I had been shown her actual leadership abilities, but we were not. So it looked as if she were weak. Even when armed with info about Oldman's character, she didn't use it to show to the world how strong she really was. I know alot of Leftists will read this and think I am a Conservative and get upset with this review. Well, that is the perfect argument for the tone of this film. It is a writers', directors', and producers' soapbox for making a Leftist statement and anti-right attack. Nothing more.

In terms of story, parts of this movie seem to have been hand written by the Democrats because the Republicans are made to look as bad as possible, while the Democrats are referred to as the good guys.  Also, in terms of politics the chances of a party-hopping atheist being nominated to the vice presidency are slim to none.  Also, it is hard to accept that these kind of improprieties did not come out in any of her previous campaigns.  The story itself is not a bad one, a female senator is chosen to ascend to the vice presidency when the vice president dies, and goes through a terrible time when her past sexual improprieties are revealed during the confirmation hearings.  So if the movie's flaws, and the silly, completely unbelievable ending can be overlooked, you will be treated to some good performances by some fine actors.

Only this time the Dude doesn't have Walter to help him, if he did we may have not seen the Dude roll. Without Walter and Donnie the Dude is aided by The Stranger, Sam Elliot, using the alias Kermit. And he has done a lot of good for the Dude. He has cleaned him up, where he no longer smokes `J's', but cigarettes instead (but that isn't necessarily a good thing, but it's legal and the Dude is after all the President). The Dude's new house would even make the Big Lebowski envious. Instead of pictures of the first lady on the wall, the Dude's has original prints of past Presidents hanging from his. It's nice to see the Dude out of his robe dressed in some new duds and to see him bowl. He has surrounded himself with Caucasians, too bad though, only if he could drink these Caucasians. Don't think he gave it a thought. I think the Dude might have had the luxury of a prescription to vicodin.The fun and games are over for the Dude and he's about to retire back to his Hollywood home, so he needs to find a successor. Who better in the Dude's mind to replace him but a babe, rather than some tired too good CSI detective (who is later relieved and sent back to television before he hurts again), so the Dude interestingly chooses Hannibal Lectors wife when he was President. That part left me puzzled. But who am I to question the Dude. Sid Vicious tries, with the aid from that lawyer from `Murder in the First,' to screw with the Dudes plans, and it leads to some tense moments. I was worried for the Dude. But in the end the Dude fixes everything and tells off Congress, which I really liked. They played some powerful music in the background when he did. But I think the Dude would have preferred some Credence. Some might say it's nice to see the has cleaned up on the cuss words, but I still prefer the man from Los Angeles. `The Dude abides.'

I had read several reviews, I had heard some of the hype, and it seemed to me I would be watching a straightforward film dealing with an interesting, but not exceptionally original idea.  I was excited to watch the film, but did not expect anything spectacular.I certainly didn't expect to be blown away, to move around with nervous energy the film built in me, to leave messages on friends and family members answering machines as soon as I was done telling them they MUST go out and rent The Contender.In my opinion most of the films today are dumbed down for a viewing audience which is perceived to be less intelligent than the people who are generating those films.  Perhaps with the success of simple, straightforward films at the box office and the less than stellar commercial success of films such as The Contender production companies are correct in releasing the type of films which they release.  I love movies and I enjoy watching a lot of what is out there, so perhaps I contribute to this.  But for me to be truly excited about a film, to want to recommend it to people it has to engage me, the films I enjoy the most are films which are smarter than me, which I have to pay attention to and which surprise and garner emotion in me.  The Contender is the finest example of a film which meets this criteria this past year, and it is a travesty that it was not nominated for Best Picture (not only was it a more impressive film than Chocolat and Erin Brocovitch, but it was also a much greater film than the winner, Gladiator which should have lost to Traffic anyway).From the very beginning The Contender manipulates the viewer, but it does so by presenting the viewer with a scenario and letting the viewer's mind work.  We perceive things by certain standards because of the way our society has led our minds to work, when The Contender shows us that things are not always as they seem, we run a gambit of emotions.  First we are ashamed, because we jumped to conclusions based on half truths and presumptions and we are shamefully wrong.  But these ideas take us out of the realm of the film, into things that happen in our lives, on our TV screens every night, and we wonder how often assumptions we make about things are wrong, if we make them because of the way stories are spun and we are taught to assume things.  The films brings up political and gender related issues, but not in traditional ways.  It never gets preachy, just presents a story, it is the viewer's responsibility to walk away and decide for themselves what lessons the film has taught them about these things. There are so many subtle signifiers and nuances it is impossible to understand the complexity of this film in just one viewing.I have not been as blown away by a film on first viewing since I saw American Beauty for the first time.  I watched The Contender on Friday night and I haven't stopped thinking about, talking about, or applying the ideas it conveyed to going on's in my daily life since.  Everyone should watch this film, it relates to all of us, and has something incredibly important to share with anyone with the brains to let it teach them.

The Contender is a 'by numbers' Washington DC 'corridors of power' movie that so wants to have the spice of Primary Colors and the constitutional gravitas of 'All the President's Men'. In the process it disgorges every Hollywood political cliche (the right wing conspiracy theory, the Chappaquidick style scandal, the Macarthyite congressional hearing), as a Hilary Clinton-esque heroine battles against narrow minded, misogynistic prejudice whilst flying the well worn flag of Roe vs Wade.Don't misinterpret my politics they are left of centre and, from what I deduce, not that far in principle from author Rod Lurie's, but I expect my political thrillers to have, well, thrills. I also expect moments of high oratorical drama to actually include some decent oratory, but the speeches throughout, are poorly written Democrat diatribes, the kind normally delivered by local mayors at Iowa bake-sales. Mr Lurie should write pamphlets to get his message across - quicker, cheaper and less painful for all concerned.The film has some bathetic, almost grotesque scenes, like Allen's pointed jogging through the military ceremony to emphasis her heroic struggle against the establishment. Plus, what appears to be the film's entire raison d'etre fails on me that the candidate's sexual indiscretions are not relevant and only of prurient interest. Yeah, in the real world! The fact she nipped her best friend's husband when on the campaign trail and flaunted it in public seems at least to suggest an uncharitable side to her and a distinct lack of nous. She also shares a strictly Arkansan sense of what constitutes both adultery and lying under oath.Her, and by extension the film's argument is that men in politics do the same all the time and get away with it, so why shouldn't she? But do they? Clinton aside, many male politician's sword play has resulted in them having to fall on it.It also take's an American film, and US writer to come out with the often hilarious and perverse world view exhibited here. Hastening to distance the film's lead from Conservative Maggie Thatcher, several references to her 'achievement' of being Britain's first female premier  are made early on in the film. But as one insider sagely observes, she was only 'allowed' to take office because the world knew Ronald Reagan would keep a check on her. He seemed to forget she was elected by a British public more cheesed off with the incumbent Labour government than anything else, and well over a year before Reagan was himself elected. But who needs history when you have Hillary and hairspray?

The presidency, says this movie, may be occupied and surrounded by fallible human beings, and may proceed from scandal through stuff-up to farce, but it is still the greatest and most noble political office on this planet, so there, all you carping critics of the mighty U S of A. Producers of these films always seem to approach the subject from a liberal, perspective (the villains are all on the Right but never in the right). This one is a fairly straight example of the genre though the producers are prepared to nail issues to parties and the generally lively script keeps us interested. It's rather like an extended episode of `West Wing' on a good night.The plot is routine &#150; a liberal Democrat President (James Bridges), getting towards the end of his second and final term names a liberal Democrat female senator (Joan Allen) to succeed his lately deceased Vice President. His choice must, under the 25th Amendment, be ratified by Congress, and of course a conservative Republican (Gary Oldman) chairs the relevant committee. The lady is happily married (how happy we see in her first scene) but she was involved in some high jinks at college many years ago and those ghastly super-efficient investigators who, due to the American habit of recording everything, can find out everything about anyone given enough time and money, dig this up for the delectation of Oldman's committee and the great American public. There is also another contender lurking in the sidelines with a suitable track record as a hero to sweep in if she stumbles. Naturally, with right and the President on her side everything turns out OK for Joan and the great American Republic. Most of the American public however were probably watching baseball while all this was happening, it being the height of summer.Here, the acting from some good, though not first rank performers, is generally very satisfying. James Bridges as the President exudes sleek confidence in an office he still clearly enjoys after six and a half years (he delights in ordering from the ever-attentive White House kitchens at any time of day or night) and he forcefully delivers the scriptwriter's paean of praise to the system at the end. Joan Allen as the nominee plays it pretty cool, and is all the more effective, though I wouldn't put her performance in the Academy award class. She once played a very brittle Pat Nixon, so I guess is familiar with the territory. (The first lady here is kept largely out of sight, no doubt to add frission to the scenes between the nominee and the president). The versatile Gary Oldman as her nemesis has the most difficult part, not so much a villain as the representative of the opposing forces, yet driven by his own demons. He is a little too twitchy at times but gives us a well-rounded picture. Christian Slater as his young eager beaver supporter is unimpressive - too nice in fact. William Petersen as the other contender played his character beautifully &#150; the sunny idiot who is not what he seems.A story like this provides lots of opportunities for scene stealing cameos, and there are nice ones from Irene Ziegler as Oldman's disaffected wife, Sam Elliott as the urbanely ruthless Chief of Staff, Kristen Shaw as the FBI ingenue who cracks the case, and Philip Baker Hall, that maestro of the cameo, as Joan's republican ex-governor Dad.`The Contender' is a straightforward piece. It is crisper than `The American President' and more uplifting than `Primary Colors,' but not as funny as `Wag the Dog' nor as ridiculous as `Independence Day' or `Air Force One,' and certainly not subversive like `Bulworth'. The US presidential style government was devised in another age when government sat but lightly on the governed. It has now acquired many of the characteristics of an elected dictatorship, mostly because the power of the executive branch which the president heads, through money and technology, now totally outweighs the other branches &#150; hence the `imperial presidency'. Dear old Westminster has adjusted to this by making governments subject to dismissal by Parliament. It's not a perfect political system either (see `Yes, Minister' or `To play the King' for a good critique), but it makes getting rid of someone like Nixon a bit easier, and electing a new head of government a lot less scary.

But some of the plot devices were the stuff of bad television writing. Maybe those associated with this film believe that the President of the United States (1)would actually address a joint session of Congress over such an issue and (2) could ever muster the courage or foolhardiness to utter such vituperation in their chambers to a Congress evidently controlled by the opposition party over (3) a nominee espousing such obviously controversial views on the social issues that dominate too much of our political agenda. It isn't ever gonna happen in real life, however. Truth is, it is illegal for the President ever to enter the halls of Congress without their invitation. While an invitation might be presumed in the context of the movie (normally it comes but once a year, for his State of the Union address, but also for requests for declarations of war, etc.), it's clear that his words are a declaration of war on their own, and would ignite such a firestorm that no President for two generations would ever be invited back.

I enjoy a good political drama and I love pulling for the underdog.  However, it detracts from a film when a writer/director uses a film as his personal pulpit from which to preach a political philosophy replete with pejorative value judgments about those who disagree.  Writer/Director Rod Lurie's story is a good one that is relevant in today's political climate.  Unfortunately, Lurie's obvious liberal crusade pervades the film and his depictions of Republicans as vile and hateful people are so exaggerated that it makes the film far less realistic.This leads to numerous plot inconsistencies.  For instance, it is impossible to believe that Senator Hanson could have switched from Republican to Democrat.  With her ultra leftist political views, she never would have been elected as a Republican initially because the party would not have supported her candidacy.  Also, Lurie tries to make Hanson into such a saintly character that he ignores the first rule of political mudslinging.  A candidate must never respond to a smear campaign when it is true, and always respond when it is false.  Another directorial error was attempting to make Hanson look like an athlete by including the running and basketball scenes when Joan Allen is not particularly athletic.Despite these unnerving flaws, the dramatic tension of the film is outstanding.  The political infighting and backroom deals are very realistic and Lurie maintains a razor sharp edge throughout, pacing the film perfectly.  He captures the supercharged atmosphere that results from the high stakes involved in national politics.The acting in this film is outstanding.  Joan Allen nails this role with a career performance that is likely to put her on the map.  She is tough and smart in her portrayal, but not so callous that she is unable to identify with the character's vulnerability.  Jeff Bridges is excellent as the president, playing the part with a haughty swagger and a cavalier attitude towards all around him.  His delivery of the final speech is spine tingling.  Gary Oldman is also electric as the evil and conniving Congressman, and though I didn't like the way the character was written, I can't imagine anyone playing him better.  Sam Elliott blows the roof off the White House with his no-bull performance as the President's Chief of Staff.This film is an excellent drama with numerous flaws propagated by a strident director with a political axe to grind.  I rated it 7/10 including a two point deduction for directorial pontification.  A director's job is to create and interpret, not to preach.

When the vice-president dies or is otherwise unable to serve his office, the president picks someone to replace him, and that person is then confirmed by a Congressional committee. Kind of like the confirmation hearings for secretary of state, secretary of agriculture, secretary of commerce, and so on. The frontrunner for the position here is Governor Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen), a nice guy/career politico who is viewed as a hero by many when he dives into a lake in an attempt to save a young girl from drowning when her car goes over a bridge. The girl dies, but Hathaway's popularity increases due to the hero factor. However, President Evans and Kermit Newman (Sam Elliott), his counsel, don't want another Chappaquiddick, so they take the governor off the list.They instead turn to Laine Hanson (Joan Allen, nominated for Best Actress), but when they announce Laine as the president's choice, a secret from her past comes to the surface. It's widely reported on the Internet that Laine engaged in sexual misconduct during her early years at Harvard University. Laine does not confirm or deny the charges; she steadfastly refuses to comment on them.The thing about politicians and their images is that we Americans care less about such scandals as stocks, money laundering, and mild bribery than we do about sex scandals. Nothing kills a campaign or hopes of a career in Washington faster than a sex scandal, and it's even worse when the politician is female.Laine consistently refuses to discuss the charges, either with the president, his counsel, the press, or, most importantly, the committee running the confirmation hearings. These hearings are chaired by Shelley Runyon (Gary Oldman, almost unrecognizable but brilliant), who wants to make the president's term end on a bad note, to make sure his place in history isn't a noble one. Runyon runs the hearings like, as his wife puts it, sort of a low-rent Joe McCarthy. Of course, during these kinds of hearings, anything goes - most of all, private lives.Hanson sticks to her story. I won't give anything else away here, but I will tell you that this is a story or principles and dignity. It is a tale of honor among thieves, to be precise; for who among us feels that there is an overwhelming amount of honor among politicians? Hanson's mantra throughout the proceedings is It is beneath my dignity to answer those charges. This is unheard  of in real life. In real life, we'd want her to answer for herself. Well, Laine doesn't want to answer for herself. So it's a stalemate. Everyone wants to know if the charges are true for two reasons for the purpose of knowing whether the good Senator Hanson is worthy of the office of the vice-president and for their own sexual curiosity. Could she have done those things? Praise should be heaped on the participants in this treat. What a cast! Bridges is tough and feisty as the president, and Allen is simply amazing as Hanson. Christian Slater has a telling role as a junior senator on the confirmation committee, but he's not terribly good. But Elliot's wonderful, as is Petersen.I would not be surprised if Joan Allen were to win the Best Actress Oscar this year. This is her third nomination, following Nixon (1995) and The Crucible (1996). Bridges has a good chance, too; this is his fourth nomination, following Starman (1984), Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), and The Last Picture Show (1971).

With a cast like this you can't be disappointed in their performances.The plot is nothing new but this can be overlooked by the great performances and quality of the script. The movie surrounds the confirmation hearings of a potential vice-president. What is unique and interesting about this is that Joan Allen is the Vice-Presidential hopeful. Jeff Bridges comes across an awesome and believable as the president of the United States. Except for Michael Douglas in The American President and Harrison Ford in Air Force One, Bridges is the best suited actor to portray the president. He has the style, ethics and convictions that a president should have.Joan Allen brings her fire and spunk to the movie as she won't back down from any fight as well as hold true to her convictions.I was so glad Christian Slater back on screen. He is one actor you can always count on to give 100 percent to every role he has. He doesn't disappoint in The Contender as he plays an up and coming politician who will do anything to advance his career.Gary Oldman turned in his greatest performance in The Contender as Shelly Runyon. Oldman, who usually plays the villain role tries to play spoiler for Bridges and Allen. Runyon will do anything to keep Allen's character out of the white house; this includes digging into her past. Oldman gives a performance that is so memorable it deserves an oscar nomination.The Contender is unlike any movie I've seen this year that has a rich and quality script that is backed by the performances of its cast. It is laced with rich and quality performances.There are 6 good quality movies that I have seen this year; they include Frequency, The Perfect Storm, The Patriot, Rules Of Engagement, Where The Heart Is and Pay It Forward. We should make it 7 with The Contender.I URGE EVERYONE TO SEE THE CONTENDER.

Some is difficult to figure out.  - major spoilers -","Date":"15 November 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  In a nutshell, the President of the United States (Jeff Bridges) nominates Lanie Hanson (Joan Allen) as Vice-President. The nominating committee chairman Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) wants Governor Hathaway (William Peterson) to be the VP instead of Lanie, so he instigates a sex-scandal investigation to discredit Lanie so that the President will (by default) nominate his 2nd choice, Governor Hathaway, after what Shelly hopes will be American public disapproval, and therefore de-nomination, of Lanie.The Contender contains the elements of a major `politico' film, where the powers in Washington are portrayed commanding power in ways one could arguably expect them to have such control. One of those ways is that the President can order any food he likes. The President is seen constantly calling the White-House kitchen to order such food as a shark steak sandwich, oatmeal cookies with grape-sized raisins, Kung-Pao chicken, grilled cheese, etc.Shelly is in some food scenes too, at a luncheon eating a Porterhouse steak with mouth-smacking enjoyment that makes the steak look absolutely delicious. Shelly informs Laine during that lunchon that she, too, should get the Porterhouse steak (burnt on the outside). However, Lanie insists that she is a vegan and instead orders the penne.In another meeting Shelly offers Reginald Webster (Christian Slater) a licorice stick, during which time he chews on one while talking to his aide.There is something very appealing about watching a good actor/actress eat with mouth-smack affection during an acting scene. I must confess that Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman have true `eat-n-act' appeal. Moreso, Bridges is seen lighting a cigarette, and inhaling it in a very satisfying way while he talks to the governor about nomination.The scenes that involve food help to characterize the screenplay. They add an extra dimension when done well. Woody Allen is another writer who includes many food scenes with characters who speak with mouths full of food, or who have an experience at the dinner table or at a restaurant.It takes a certain acting talent to be able to act with a mouth full of food, and I think that one of the selling points of the film is just that -- Gary Oldman & Jeff Bridges both act with perfect accuracy in every food scene. It adds credibility to the subject; these ARE busy people, after all, who multitask. They conduct business while they eat.The Contender is worth seeing just for the performances of Gary Oldman and Jeff Bridges, who are both incredibly talented actors.I am at a loss, however, while trying to figure out what type of person Shelly is supposed to represent. He IS a moral character in the film. As his wife mentions, he spearheaded an initiative that made hate crimes a felony, but in the same movie he reduces himself during the movie's confirmation hearing plot because, she said, he acts as a second-rate McCarthy in his pursuit of Laine's sex-scandal. This is a mis-mash of events. Shelly is not inherently `evil', but he does miss the point. He misses the point that a woman can be Vice-President. However he is made out to look like an idiotically-blind committee chairman, a characteristic that opposes the rest of his character development.After seeing the movie twice, I am convinced that the movie was edited in a way that misses the bigger picture..In the scene where Laine is first notified about the sex-scandal pictures, a funny thing happens. Lanie looks at a couple of the pictures, puts them down, then tilts her head and rests it in her hand as though she is deeply pensive. The film cuts immediately to the actual sex scene where a young girl is being gang-banged.This editing suggests that Lanie WAS involved in the gang-bang. In every movie I have ever watched...whenever a film shows an actor/actress up close, then cuts to a silent scene for a few seconds...this is a method of conveying that the actor is thinking about what the viewer sees. Like a cartoon character with little bubbles forming a line to a small cloud, and inside the cloud is a sentence...we all know that the cartoon character is thinking something.In THIS scene, the film shows Laine thinking about the gang-bang, which by the way is exactly the same scene that is repeated throughout the film. So here we have Lanie, who is contemplating something. That something is the gang-bang scene. It's LANIE's gang-bang scene because the standards of filmmaking show it to be that.But here is why I am confused. At the end of the film Lanie denies the gang-bang to the President.So at the end of the film we know 2 possible things. One is that Lanie is a liar and lied to the President. But this doesn't make sense, because Lanie is a very, very moral person who has extremely high standards. She CAN'T be lying, because the entire film portrays her as one of the most high-standing individuals in the history of Washington D.C.The *second* option is that the film was just edited loosely, and the scene that cuts to Lanie thinking about the actual gang-bang, which in the rest of Hollywood would have meant that somebody was thinking about something, instead in this film seems to have been utilized so that the viewer could conceptualize the scene.I lean toward the 2nd option, because Shelly's character is underdeveloped and not nearly as complex as Gary Oldman, a genius actor, helps to create in this character. I believe that the filmmakers did not have the resources to make this film worthy of all the talent in it. It was cut and pasted together in a manner that leaves holes in what could have been a film with a bigger story to tell.That said, the film is filled with beautifully-acted scenes. I think that just about every scene is worthy of watching. To put it another way, The Contender is a patchwork where every scene is fascinating to watch for the scene's own merits. That alone makes it worth watching more than once.As a side note, it is interesting that Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and Saul Rubinek were ALL in 1993's True Romance, a brilliant film.I recommend The Contender because it is a satisfying film to watch. I felt a closeness to the characters and scenes that not many movies convey. "},{"Title":"A film with guts.","Date":"15 November 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Warning may be some spoilers.I am Canadian.  Our exposure of politics doesn't come close to our American cousins so when the Prime Minister does something a little out of the ordinary, it makes the news for a couple of days and then it pretty much goes away.  But we watch CNN and we keep abreast of what is happening in the USA.  And one of the things that has always struck me as silly when it comes to the judging of politicians is when their personal life becomes just as important to the public as their politics does.  The way I see it, the American public wants a person for president that just does not exist. They want someone who doesn't smoke, believes in God, goes to church, has never thought of committing adultery, has never had pre-marital sex, has never had a drink in their life, has never taken any sort of illegal drugs in their life, has never been tempted by anyone or anything to commit an indecent act, someone who never speeds, is in fantastic shape, listens to good Christian music, never curses, shouts, frowns and probably a president that never has to do number 2 in the bathroom.  They want perfection in a person when no person can be perfect.  If a president commits one act of impropriety, in anyone's eyes, then they are labeled unfit to serve.  It's like the line in some movie who's title escapes me right now, that says,  I always wondered why if someone was a prostitute all of a sudden they can't see very well.  American's want a seemingly perfect person when they themselves may be as imperfect as the next person, and that only stands to reason.The Contender is a film that takes a stand.  It takes a stand and takes it firmly.Joan Allen, in an Oscar worthy performance, plays Lane Hanson, a state senator that is being nominated for the Vice Presidency after the former died in office.  There are other politicians that feel that she should not be the V.P. and they will stop at nothing to prevent her from succeeding. It's not that her views and politics are diametric to what the others are, it's just that she is a woman.  And it also turns out that she is a woman with a past.Shelley Runyon, also an Oscar worthy performance by Gary Oldman, is the perpetrator behind the scheme to drag her name through the mud.  It seems that Lane was privy to a party in her first year of university where she may have been involved in a gang bang.  The pictures look like her and there are men that are coming forward to substantiate the story.  It is here that her character is put on trial.  We also learn that she slept with a married man, that she does not go to church and she does not believe in the Biblical God and she feels that church and school should be separate entities.  And she believes in abortion.  She is grilled by Runyon in hopes that she will crack and that her reputation is damaged enough so that the American people would never support a questionale character like this.  But Lane will not comment on her personal life.  She will not substantiate the claims of her alleged gang bang in college and the reason that she won't do so is because it is really no ones business.The problem with this is that she has been recommended by the President of the United States, to succeed as the V.P.  Now this makes the president and his advisers, particularly, Kermit Newman, played with delicious venomness by an unrecognizable Sam Elliot, also in an Oscar worthy performance, become questionable characters because they are the ones that are supporting her. To Lane's credit, she will not bow to pressure.  Not from the public, not from Runyon, and not even from the President himself, to come forward and at least admit that she did the act.  Lane vehemently maintains that her personal life should stay personal.I will not spoil the film by telling you how it turns out.  I won't even tell you how some of the situations play out.  What I will say is that the film had a grip on me.  It indoctrinated me with how it felt and what it believed.  There are not many films that have the integrity and the guts to tell it like it is.  The Contender does.  It makes us open our eyes and ask ourselves why does it really matter if someone has questionable morals. If you commited adultery, would you be fired from your job?  If you slept with 75 women or in this case, 75 men, before you got married, should you be labelled a slut and deemed not fit to serve?  What does that have to do with how capable you are to run a country and keep it's beliefs and democracy safe?  There is so much emphasis put on one's sexual appetite that we seem to forget that one has nothing to do with another.The Contender has my vote as being one of the best films to come out so far this year.  I would only put High Fidelity and Gladiator above it.  But since those two pictures have zero chance of winning Oscars, I will say that this should be the leading Contender for Oscar.10 out of 10- you will not find a better film this year.

As one myself, I know for a fact that no elected official in this country can rise above the level of dog-catcher without proclaiming their undying fealty to the Judeo-Christian God. If you doubt me, look through the resumes of the 535 members of Congress, the 50 governors, and the President and Vice-President (whoever they turn out to be!) Though the national numbers say there should be at least 30 and perhaps as many as 60 declared atheists among them, I challenge you to find one.  If they had wanted to make a truly realistic political drama, they could have the House debating the candidate's fitness for vice-president in light of her declared atheism.

Perhaps it is a really good look into the spiritually corrupt amorality of the neo-fascist cabal which is trying to run the country these days.  Their sham facade of humanistic pretense and all of its phoney social justice is an attempt to mask what is in the end some Orwellian-style tyranny.  The climactic scene of the movie certainly prescribed such a world.

Lurie is unafraid to go soft in a long, long closeup, to give us a jostling, forward-running feeling of stuff caught on the fly. And he dazzles with sheer verisimilitude everything in this opening section feels real, from the president (Jeff Bridges) who's obsessed with ordering obscure meals, to the tough-teacher way the press secretary (Saul Rubinek) handles a pushy reporter. The mix of buyableness and visual extravagance suggests that Lurie studied Preminger's ADVISE AND CONSENT; so does the appearance of Gary Oldman as a downhome fixer, an update on Charles Laughton's Southern tie-twiddler in Preminger's pulp epic. Like Laughton, Oldman is so magnificent in his hammery you forget the role, the dumb dialogue, the hoary malefics; Oldman is a whole dynamo's worth of master-thespian power rush.But then the plot takes over. A woman vice-presidential nominee (Joan Allen), replacement for a recently deceased VP, is accused of taking part in a frathouse gang-bang in her youth. As the spin is spun and various (but not too many) treacheries are unearthed, one discovers that one is not watching a cynical, hard-assed, just-the-facts muckraker in the style of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but rather something that feels more like a fond DreamWorks farewell dinner for the outgoing forty-second president. The movie seems to have been generated by Lurie's watching the Clinton impeachment hearings and its aftermath, and thinking, But what they should have said was...! That esprit de l'escalier, the should've-saids, is his script. So we get to watch Joan Allen be noble and long-suffering and stoic and tell the world It just isn't any of your business ten times or so. And in the end, the entire world is shamed by Joan Allen's gravitas.Oliver Stone had it on the ball when he cast Joan Allen as Pat Nixon. Regal, sexless, annoyingly martyr-y and furtively poignant, Allen was right on the money. Everywhere else, she seems to anticipate a roomful of applause just for being so darned classy. I don't think I can recall a funny or spontaneous second in any of her performances. Her nobility is a drag when the rest of the cast is lots of fun. Jeff Bridges hasn't been this good in ages his self-possessed president is an icon unto himself, less a composite of other presidents than an astounding creation unto himself. (Bridges' goofily overwrought way of shaking hands with people--half aggressive, half self-deprecatingly silly--deserves about four Oscars alone.) Christian Slater has never been as good as he is here as a Newt Revolution junior congressman in a moral tailspin, and William Petersen and the sexy Kristin Shaw are a groovy update on the Macbeths.This movie can make even a Nader voter yearn for a right-wing message movie. Lurie gives Clinton a vagina, and gives Mrs. Ken Starr an abortion; when Joan Allen gives a declaration-of-principles speech, you feel it's what Lurie wanted to hear at the last Democratic convention. (Right down to I may be an atheist, but this temple of democracy is my chapel! In this age of Liebermanian piety, does Lurie really think principled agnosticism would fly?) As one wag put it, the movie seems designed to jerk a standing ovation from Rob Reiner. Everything about it, down to the nauseating end title--For Our Daughters --smacks of Pacific Palisades limousine liberalism.Won't a good right-wing bigot--a James Cameron, a Clint Eastwood--make THE PHILANDERER?

And sex sells.When the vice president suddenly dies, President Jackson Evans is faced with the task of finding a replacement.   His decision is made doubly difficult by the fact that Laine Hanson, the person he wants to name as successor, not only isn't a distinguished war hero (it never hurts) she also happened to switch political parties, earning many powerful enemies in the process.   It's what Evans doesn't know however that might sink his hope of leaving office with a legacy.It is no coincidence that a movie about dirty tricks in politics should hit the screens soon after the LewinskyGate debacle and less than a month before the federal election.  The movie sets out to examine several important issues should someone's sexual past (or present) have any bearing on their ability to hold office, does the public have any right to know and are women treated more harshly?  The answers (in my opinion anyway) are no, no and yes.  Unfortunately, the film turns into a liberal revenge piece, and spends the bulk of its time making monsters and messiahs - Hanson is painted as the only good apple in a bad barrel, her every move scored with a thundering soundtrack.   In addition, the plot twists are so blatantly obvious to anyone who bothers to pay attention, that the climax fizzles.  While I have definite reservations about the subject matter, I can't say the same for the actors.In his most powerful performance since The Fabulous Baker Boys Jeff Bridges' food-obsessed President (almost every one of his scenes is prefaced by an order from the kitchen -he is determined to find something that they don't carry) is both clever and quirky.  Gary Oldman is both remarkable and practically unrecognizable as Shelly Runyon, the man who heads the committee to confirm the VP.  Unfortunately, due to postproduction editing - almost twenty minutes were cut - Runyon is so demonized that he is rendered little more than a caricature (Oldman was so upset by the final product that he is considering legal action, claiming he was misled).  It is Joan Allen who truly shines as the stoic, principled politician, who is willing to stand by her beliefs, regardless the cost, she creates an immensely powerful female character.   She and Michelle Rodriguez will have to duke it out come Oscar time. Excellent portrayals notwithstanding, Contender fails to even attempt objectivity, instead embracing extremism, for a world that is either black or white.  The final result is a bland story with little offer.   Too bad.

When they look at me, they see what they are.Undoubtedly, there will be no similar movie called Clinton, about arguably the most corrupt and unethical administration in American history.  But during The Contender recent events unfolding in D.C. are not far from our minds.  And Clinton could repeat Nixon's line, looking squarely at Hollywood.It's disappointing, to see Hollywood's collapse, as epitomized by this wrong-headed pablum.  Once upon a time, even when Hollywood supported in its movies a morality that existed ideally in the heartland, it made movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, about an ordinary man confronting a corrupt establishment.  In the movies, Mr. Smith won.  In real life, he would've been eaten alive.  As the 1960s turned into the 1970s, the anti-establishment anti-hero was all the rage.  Establishment was bad.By the 1990s, the Establishment -- in academia, in Hollywood, in the White House -- veered dramatically to the left, guided by former rebels who were now the power in the world.  Hollywood never schmoozed with one of its own who became president as much as with the two-term president from Arkansas who lived in the Hollywood style rich, powerful, vindictive, corrupt, and ultimately amoral.  Rules were for losers . . . even rules spelled out in the Constitution were negotiable, and an oath to protect and defend it were just words.Oliver Stone's Nixon was a powerful morality play about political corruption and retreat from the truth.  The Contender is an amorality play about how truth -- and corruption --  is nobody's business.One simply cannot divorce this movie from the headlines.  As Hollywood and left-wing politicians stumbled over themselves to condemn their man in ultimate power.  They were willing even to condemn him in potent terms for violating all sorts of sexual taboos (even taboos liberals themselves promoted against good men, like sexual harassment) to defend their president against perjury and obstruction of justice, and Hollywood cheered as blackmailers were publicly, without even a mask, were set on those who were uncovering Nixonian corruption, to destroy their characters of seekers of truth.But as it turned out, character did matter, as the president committed perjury, betrayed his friends, lied to the public, and ultimately bombed other countries in order to distract from the judicial wheels that were turning in a vain attempt to bring him to justice for Constitutional violations.  As long as matters remain sexual, they may be the subject of light comedy.  When laws are broken and cover-ups invoked that would make Nixon jealous, and a man is brought down by his own character flaws, it is a tragedy.  And ultimately, when a president plays with human lives to cloak his lawbreaking, it becomes an atrocity.Perhaps this film was made like good art, just borrowing from current events. . .  But throughout one senses that its sinister undercurrent is to defend an indefensible Establishment, because the film-makers were drunk with their own power, and their proximity to the powerful.  Ultimately, this film remind one of Leni Riefenstahl's propagandistic pro-establishment features.  Face it is the private life of someone who deliberately enters politics, grabs the public eye at every chance, as politicians are wont to do, and then has the post powerful post in the world, where the lives and safety of my family are in his/her hands, and makes laws that govern me, my business?  You bet it is.  And the fact that, in reality, human lives were callously played with and lost in the coverup should prove that this unpleasantly partisan and judgmental, self-righteous and sanctimonious flick (which wags its finger in your face, much as President Clinton did) is not only wrong-headed, but makes a fair-minded person sick at heart that Hollywood brown-noses a corrupt establishment and a broken system.

It would be nice if some of the concepts in this film would come true, but the cynic in me doesn't see it happening any time soon, regardless I'm sure President Clinton loved some (or most) of the messages here.The film has an agenda that's not even loosely veiled. It addresses many of the issues of the last 8 years with a obvious slant towards the left. Now there is NOTHING wrong with that but 50 percent (+or - 10) of the voting population will no doubt have a problem with one (or more) of the messages being honored here.I should mention that there is also the underlying message of all we are saying, is give girls a chance - I look forward to the day when we don't have to make such pleas, someday this country will grow up...but then I watch COPs or Jerry Springer...and just sigh...sorry I'm drifting.The cast is the best thing about this film, there are some good (but not great) performances, no Oscar nominations here I'm afraid.

This issue comes to light AFTER she is selected to be VP. I have a hard time buying that this would ever happen in this day and age.This sort of scandal would have been exposed LONG before she would have been considered for the VP position.  Add to that the fact that (A) she is a Governor's daughter (B) this was folklore on her college campus and (C) she ran for (and won) a SENATE position, makes the plot point that this issue still needs to be fully addressed even less plausible.I wouldn't have made her a Governor's daughter, it would have helped - some. In the end, she was too squeaky clean to be a politician.  There was a hint that something in her past was worthy of her stepping down (when the cute FBI agent gave Sam Elliot the investigation report) but in the end it was just a red herring used distract us, unsuccessfully.And speaking of which, wasn't that FBI agent just too damn cute? I mean when we first are introduced to her and she's interviewing Gary Oldman, didn't most of us think she was going to try and seduce him to get some dirt? Not the best casting I'm afraid, though her performance was just dandy.FWIW Then the whole Adultery perjury thing was weak and felt like filler (it was nice to see Mariel Hemingway though.)Later in the film's big twist it's divulged that the girl who drowned in the bridge accident was once a member of secret ops (or something like that) and that the accident was staged (uh-doy).  The only problem with that is, why the heck was she so stupid about getting out of the car? Anyone doing such a stunt would know to roll the window down to help equalize the water pressure.  I contend that she would have had the window down already and would had been prepared to get out quickly.The writers decided to killed her to try to disguise that this was a staged event and thus embed a twist in the film, didn't work.  Now, if they had knocked the girl out from the impact, it would have been easier to accept later on but NO they needed the dramatic images of her drowning in the car. (Plus didn't they see Abyss?

It seems that creativity and true freedom to have an individual voice have been restricted quite a bit in the last 25 years. This movie shows us how costly standing up for one's values in the face of public pressure can be. It also shows us some of the rewards possible with such integrity. The movie names Democrats and Republicans as such, within the fictional world of the story. No generic or safe amorphous political figures, unidentifiable and therefore inoffensive to all. That is rare in movies, and exciting in a sneaky kind of way. No big fuss is made over it, but as an audience member you later realize how cool that is. No 555 faked-up personas here! That's a quiet victory, perhaps, but I was nonetheless impressed (later) with how much courage that took. So Yaay! to the writer/director Lurie.The cast was also great. I had never heard of Joan Allen-- until I read a profile of her in the NY Times. Turns out I had seen her several times before, and had enjoyed and admired her talent quite a bit. But like another great actor, Robert Duvall, Joan Allen seems to disappear so completely in a role that she may be somewhat Invisible as an actor. That's a blessing, and the highest compliment. But it also might be frustrating for her and her fans, at times, wouldn't you think? The very thing that makes her so great as an actor is the same thing that might make it hard to remember her outside of the role she played.Jeff Bridges is fantastic, as usual. Gary Oldman is another actor with a two-edged sword thing going. He always seems to play creeps and villains. He is such a good actor that he seems creepy himself, because we don't get to see a better side of him.Overall, this is a great movie. Oh-- one flaw What's with all the focus on chewing and eating?

This problem typically causes that second film to not be as satisfying as it could or should be, as the filmmaker tends to under-step that dramatic boundary that could have easily made the film more thought provoking.  With his second Hollywood film `The Contender', writer/director Rod Lurie (`Deterrence') falls into this precise trap.The film shows us a United States where the Vice President has recently passed away, and President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) must choose a replacement.  Against advice from all over the political spectrum, the President chooses Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) who, herself, has a near flawless background despite.  However, during the confirmation hearing, a fierce congressman (Gary Oldman) brings to light a past that could easily destroy the would-be Vice President's chances of taking the position as well as her political career for good.  Needless to say, the lines between what is the public's concern and what should be kept locked away become blurred quickly.What Lurie illustrates on screen is an overall incredible narrative with realistic characters, phenomenal dialogue (which is easy to understand for those who don't know the first thing about politics), and a situation that could have easily been pulled straight from the headlines.  With all of these elements going for it, `The Contender' should have been one of those provocative films that had audience members walking away from it in deep conversation about the world we live in.   Unfortunately, Lurie believed he learned his lesson with the nuclear flop that was `Deterrence' released earlier this year, but these two films, though both political brain-pickers, are as far apart from each other as Bernard Shaw's moments of comedy (for those who don't know what I am talking about, just watch a Presidential debate on TV and you will).  Sure, `The Contender' did not need to be as melodramatic as `Deterrence' ended up being, but that under-stepping of the dramatic line is so evident that one finds themselves literally speaking to the characters of the film to do something.  And Lurie always makes sure to tempt us with those moments, giving us just a taste of what could happen before pulling back altogether and moving along.  It is enough to make someone watch both this and `Deterrence' at the same time to try and reach a happy medium.The same goes for the performances, which, although they were all top-notch in their own subtle ways, were never allowed to reach that height of drama that they could have, the kind of emotion that wins Academy Awards.  None of the actors could be viewed as headliners, as each character was given just about as much screen-time as the next.  However, if one performance were to stick out, it would have to be Oldman's portrayal as Shelly Runyon, the right wing crusader who could certainly be the reincarnation of Joseph McCarthy.  It is his performance alone that projects him to the top of the cast in the audience's eyes. `The Contender' does get your brain going.  It does succeed in making you think about the `what-ifs' that exist in our society.  That alone is enough for it to be considered a good movie.  However, it is a shame to see all of the elements in the film that were held back that could have made it great.  Hopefully, for Rod Lurie, third time is the charm.Grade B- (Rated R for language, adult situations, brief nudity, and mild violence)  "},{"Title":"A good movie that might have been better.","Date":"15 October 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  In some respects, The Contender is right on the money and makes valid points there IS a double standard with respect to the sexual histories of men and women in public life.

She isup before the senate hearings, for confirmation as Vice President.  Senator Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) is her foe, who thinks she is unworthy because of many reasons - but uses a past sexual incident in her life, attempting to discredit her, and, ultimately, destroy her.There is a magical thing that happens when Gary Oldman is on the screen.  Were he not in this film, one might be tempted to ask, Who cares?, in regard to whether Joan Allen's character gets the Vice Presidency or not. When Gary Oldman is on the screen, you CARE.  You care, because he MAKES you care. His performance is so gripping, that you become interested in everything he says or does - and therefore, you are drawn into the plot, actually caring about its outcome.Gary Oldman is probably the best actor alive today. He is never given the credit that is due him (without a doubt), and he is, quite often, misunderstood by common critics. They mistake the absolute purity of his performances, for over-acting. This is because these critics, themselves, have not the depth to understand what it is that Gary Oldman does. And that is simple. He gives it his all.  He is so convincing, so utterly brilliant, that one is sometimes embarrassed by relating to him. One canalmost feel what he goes through, right or wrong, and that isoften too painful for some of those who do not have a clue as to what true, raw emotions LOOK like. They look like what Gary Oldman makes us feel - uncomfortable or not.The film is good. The story is good. The cast is good.

But there wasn't.  There was less.  I didn't think anyone could make such a bland movie without some twist to make the viewer re-evaluate their conceptions of the characters and events.  Instead of devious plot twists we were left with highly overdramatic speeches about patriotism and convictions.  This could have been a great movie.  The cast and performances (except for the hokey speeches) were excellent (especially Gary Oldman), but they were completely wasted on one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. There were also too many tangents that didn't go anywhere; Oldman's wife visiting with Hansen, the revelation of the governor's rescue, the FBI investigator, the shocking testimony of the Hansen's husband's ex wife.

This is a huge exception. From beginning to end, the story is absolutely riveting. A popular governor is fishing in a boat under a bridge when a car crashes into the water. He jumps in to try to rescue a young woman, but she drowns. He becomes a media darling at a time when the White House is seeking a new Vice President. Jeff Bridges plays the President and he tells the guy that the American public will be reminded of the Ted Kennedy incident because the girl died. He then nominates Senator Hansen(Joan Allen) for the office as the first woman VP. He hopes it will be his legacy.The dirty tricks occur quickly, as some old photos turn up of Senator Hansen from her college days. She is in a sexually compromising position with two guys at a party. Of course the material is leaked to the press and the hearings become a circus. Gary Oldman is is unrecognizable as the backstabbing chair of the judicial panel questioning the Senator about her past. Bridges, Allen, and Oldman are perfectly cast and the script is smart and believable. Slightly overlong at a little over two hours, but still worth watching.

It contained many of my favourite actors of today, particularly the always amazing Joan Allen.The plot is comparatively simple.  The Vice-President of the United States passes away, and the President (Jeff Bridges), nearing the end of his second term, decides to appoint a woman as his 'legacy'.  This decision is complicated by the fact that a popular Governor, another possible candidate, has recently been portrayed as  hero in the press for attempting to rescue a drowning car crash victim.Naturally, many conservatives are appalled by what they see as 'affirmative action' gone rampant, and unearth tales of a sexual escapade in college to discredit the nominee.First the good - all the lead roles are well filled, Joan Allen is dignified and mature, Jeff Bridges is fantastic, Gary Oldman hissable, and Christian Slater is finally learning how to portray a grown-up.  The script is comparatively intelligent, as doesnt resort to a particularly graphic depiction of the events in college.The not-so-good - the twists in the last third of the movie could be spotted a country mile off and were very clearly telegraphed.  Also, while I personally agree with most of the politics of Joan Allen's character, we were meant to believe that she had moved from the Republican party to the Democrats.  This is despite the fact that she was pro-choice, an atheist, favoured the banning of guns, had married a divorcee and so forth.  In what alternate universe would ANYONE be elected to Congress as a Republican with that pedigree?The direction and cinematography is fairly unobtrusive.  Some symbolic shots (such as Allen in a white jogging suit surrounded by white tombstones) is fairly heavy-handed.  The conclusion is fairly trite, and is in some senses a cop-out of the issues the film raised.But hey, its better than 'Tomcats'....

Yet in my view it was just as naive and simplistic as the Jimmy Stewart 'classic'.Don't get me wrong, I do not agree politically with any Republicans, but I've got to agree that this movie is little better than illogical pro-Clinton liberal propaganda. Admittedly, it's message is not particularly pernicious (i.e. that politicians should be judged on their abilities and not on their private lives) but movies should be made to entertain, to educate and to provoke thought and not to try and bolster a cult of personality for the ex-President.  Besides, The Contender's concluding scenes are so hypocritical that they destroy the film's main points. For instance if the Joan Allen character was so depressed at the way the system chewed her up and spat her out, then why does she accept the Presidential nomination at the end? Surely she can't have accepted it in the hope that her nomination would open the floodgates for American women in politics because her treatment would have only backed up her existing perception about the endemic sexism in Congress.What's more when she reveals to the President that she had never admitted to having been involved in the orgy because she hadn't been there the director obviously wants us to think well done Joan Allen, aren't you a brilliantly principled paragon of virtue. But we the viewer end up thinking Joan Allen, you dumb cow - nearly sacrificing your political career to try and prove a point that would have ultimately have been lost on those who sought to destroy you. Besides, by using this plot devise the film makers are essentially attempting to exonerate Clinton by saying that people have no right to question his private life. Maybe so, but it is a politician's duty to tell the truth under oath. Clinton didn't do that, therefore he doesn't deserve to go down in history as a martyr for poltical truth and justice.However, to suggest that the Republican right are portrayed unrealistically (as some people have done) I think is wrong. Garry Oldman perfectly portrays the creepiness of many so-called 'compassionate Conservatives' (why do so many of them have unisex names such as Shelly?). Whatever, you may think of Clinton, Kenneth Starr was definitely as hypocritical by claiming that what the President had done was morally repulsive, only to publish these repulsive deeds in pornographic detail.And as for the impassioned speech to Congress at the end of the film... for goodness sake. As if the President enjoys such an unassailable position in Congress that he can just tell all his opponents off and expect them to just accept his vice-Presidential nominee out of shame.Finally, the idea that all this political manouvering was being conducted out of personal principle (the Democrats fighting for sexual equality and the Republicans against it) is fundamentally unrealistic. For anyone with an ounce of poltical savvy knows that any two party political system (I include the British system in this equation) is oiled and given impetus not by the convictions of its elected elections officials, but by money, lots and lots of money.

With a few exceptions, it is a superb example of what it tries to be, which is a naturalistic portrayal of a political trial.  The acting is uniformly first rate, for one thing, in its low-key approach to sometimes critical scenes. Jeff Bridges is smooth, human, and politically savvy; Joan Allen is not the glamour girl with glossy lips that one might have expected; Christian Slater is less like Jack Nicholson than ever before; Sam Eliot is reliably himself, though he's beginning to walk and cock his head in such a way as to lead us to believe he's spent most of his life on horseback; and Gary Oldman as the chief villain is more than merely good.  The thick glasses, the never-smiling face, the calculating expression, the gusto with with he consumes red meat.  And his hair!  A widow's peak modeled perhaps after Nixon's, but now standing up on its hind legs from a receding brow, something resembling a cross between a brillo pad and a punk mohawk.  There are surprises and unexpected twists in the believable plot that are handled so matter-of-factly and with such effortless aplomb by the director and performers that they make films like The Best Man look like stagey high school productions.  There are meetings, important ones, that are reminiscent of The Godfather except that they carry a Waspish, non-emotional quality so that we don't expect the participants to break into Senza Mamma any minute.  I mentioned some exceptions to the high quality of this production, but they are important exceptions.  It is, alas, a propaganda movie.  It didn't matter to me as a viewer that the controversial figure who was up for appointment as VP was a woman.  So what?  I didn't find the feminism laid on that thick.  However, the rest of the ideology expressed in the film represented a simple-minded point of view that clearly deliniated the good and the bad.  At times it was like watching one of those post World War II movies with the good Allies fighting the bad Nazis, even down to the one or two good Germans thrown in.  I admire the film's willingness to take an explicit political stance that involves real issues such as abortion and gun control and capital punishment.  Okay, let's bring it out in the open.  Too often we get hyped up generalizations in political dialogues that amount to platitudes.  God, see President Lyman's final tunnel of freedom speech in Seven Days in May.  The problem in this case is the lack of ambiguity, the stark contrast between good and evil, represented by the democrats and republicans respectively, the latter forces led by Shelly Runyon (what a name!).  If life were only that simple.  But of course it isn't.  Even Nixon had a dog!  Why can't the nice, friendly, right-thinking president have a collection of panty hose in his closet? Why couldn't the dignified VP nominee have actually gone down on all those frat rats?  Wouldn't what was supposed to be the main point -- it's nobody's business -- have been made equally plain?  Why do so many producers, directors, and writers feel they must preach in order for the audience to understand.  Whom do they think is sitting in the theater seats -- chimpanzees?  Some kind of weird humanoid mutants with the sensitivity of celery stalks?  There's the insolence of office for you!   The president's self-righteous final speech is painful to watch and listen to, even though his prejudices echo my own.  Give us a Shelly Runyon with a name like Lance Sterling.  Give us a president who likes to slip into something warm and fuzzy when the lights are out.

Yes, Joan Allen for President. The role of Senator Laine Hanson epitomized the integrity we so rarely see practiced today. It is the demonstration of such steadfastness to principles, being able to hold one's head up high, keeping an ever level-headed composure, and not succumb to the pressures of others the masses, media, peers, or political powers that be. She has the tenacity and tolerance to be who she knows she is. Here in this story, she has the good fortune of family/husband's support to see her through the ordeal.The Contender has a well-structured plot, with its facets of truth subtly unfolding methodically. Don't be fooled by the natural dialog, the seemingly at ease tempo of the film, you will have suspense, and there are unexpected twists and turns. It's one intriguing, well-written and deftly directed entertaining movie. The film shows us what true political attitudes for the basic good of all Americans/citizens could be - certainly not easy to come by. Applause to writer-director Rod Lurie! Once again, as he has spent a whole script in emphasizing the important task and responsible role of an American president in Deterrence, he seized the chance to stress, even though this time in passing, the President is the person who controls the atomic bomb.Jeff Bridges is perfect here portraying the President who is so very at ease and naturally human - hm, the always have-an-appetite for food President! Sam Elliott - you've never seen him so furiously aggressive and curt as the President's advisor. Of course there's the ever-present media - call it lurkingly intimidating or falsely friendly. William Petersen's Senator Jack Hathaway has struck the right tone - gave the audience just enough to believe what we see. And Lurie knows the habits of the masses so well - anticipated dead on what people tend to assume, yes, so readily accept what we hear or see as is. Gary Oldman in the opposing role - playing the staunch devil's advocate, not to be swayed by any humanity circumstances whatsoever. Christian Slater is the other role we hope to have more of in real life. He is the young and forthright, all excited wide-eyed 28-year-old congressman, who has the opportunity to do the right thing!Writer-director Rod Lurie's previous effort, 1998 Deterrence, with Kevin Pollak as president and Timothy Hutton as his advisor, Sheryl Lee Ralph as security chief, is a gem of a sleeper. The drama of the whole film is captured within a single set of a diner, with the dialog, the interaction of the characters, the events and happenings well integrated and delivered. It's an effective modern day version of Sidney Lumet's 1964 directed Fail-Safe.Running Mates, a 1992 HBO cable movie, with Diane Keaton and Ed Harris, is a political/romantic drama, which may be a fantasy, but the concern is real. It attempts to point out the absurdity of today's media, so suggestively controlling over what 'truth' shall be released to the public, however irrelevantly private the information may be. Go see The Contender and encourage others to do so...

The plot was insultingly inept and generally transparent, but one kept hoping for some realism and something other than the usual Hollywood ending reeking with silly, left-wing propaganda. In reality, this contender for VP would have been dumped in the initial vetting by the FBI even before she was nominated -- and for good reason. Screwing your best friend's husband and breaking up their marriage ain't exactly the highest recommendation for character or loyalty (the two themes constantly hammered out in this drab flick). Considering this bimbo's strident hatred of religion, her sophomoric philosophy on gun control, her ignorance of the political process (or her role in it), and (as already mentioned) her appalling lack of character, she couldn't be elected to anything except perhaps in Southern California, Massachusetts or Nazi Germany. Thank heavens.The hearing scenes were dreadful and unrealistic (though with some clever writing); the writer obviously had no clue that there necessarily would have been at least two hard-core defenders to kill the Oldman character's momentum. The treacly, nauseating ending, as vocalized (more or less) by the robotic Jeff Bridges, had all of us old Capitol Hill hands rolling on the floor. The writer's knowledge of politics seems to have come strictly from watching Mr Smith Goes to Washington, instead of actually doing some research.I wouldn't be as mad if it weren't such a waste of Oldman's and Elliott's great talents.Elliott's casting, in particular, was a master stroke.....though he really needs to grow back the moustache.

The emotional hook here is principled patriotism, which is thoroughly exercised. I wonder about people who complain that a movie manipulates them. What movie doesn't? What is intriguing about the comments here are that people get wrapped up in the politics of the plot, and judge it based on whether it matches their own visceral politics.Rather the notion that the nation is founded on principles is lost. This could be great art if only, if only there were some way to make people face the way they react as they do. Film art is about the viewer, not the creator. Still, it is a curiosity that anyone would wonder, after Newt, Lott, Army and Burton why a smarmy Republican and his sanctimonious posturing wouldn't ultimately become stereotyped fodder for popular art.Lastly, some comments here and in the press assume that Dreamworks' heavyhanded left-leaning was to influence the election. Be serious. Whoever is president cannot affect them, only the Congress, and they are relatively cheap to buy. In today's market without campaign finance reform that's even less than the budget of this film. Dreamworks just wants to make money by creating a stir.

The last ten minutes make it all a total charade, before which it's a drama about the first woman appointed to be vice president, but soon enough her nomination pivots entirely on a question mark from her youth Did she more or less freely partake in group sex in college? An investigator purses his mouth over a decades-old photograph from a sorority party. If it is, she's going to have difficulty getting congressional approval.The movie's candidly progressive and Democratic, its antagonists conservative Republicans. When The Contender is referred to as a veiled commentary on the Lewinsky scandal, there's one word of that description that's incorrect Veiled. The distinction between Hanson and Clinton is that when fanatics begin using their trademark impassioned rhetoric and lies by omission to steal a look into her linen closet, she purely declines to satisfy their questions, which is what Clinton should've done. It's none of your business, she correctly tells GOP Rep. Shelly Runyon, whose strategy for acquiring and sustaining political power is by tempting the public's preconceptions, emotions and fears. An important line between legal wrongdoing and personal matter is only crossed and justified as soon as we begin to comply. This is true not only of political sex scandals but of HUAC's demagogic, reckless accusations, as well as any other public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents that could've been sidestepped were it not that the pattern of fear mongering is usually one of repetition, in order to continuously reinforce the intended effects of this vicious circle.The current VP dies. It's generally presumed that a man will substitute, and a foremost nominee is Gov. Hathaway, who's just made heroic news. It's a spectacle like this, not a life of service, that the persona-mongers prefer, but the governor's trouble is that his rescue attempt fell short. Now President Evans wishes to make bold print in the textbooks by selecting a woman, and Sen. Hanson seems ideal. She's happily married, has a child, and when we first see her is having vigorous sex on a desk with her husband. Runyon, Gary Oldman's character, distrusts any woman entrusted with the nuclear switch What if she gets all emotional? He's thrilled by data of her campus escapades.The movie's written and directed by Rod Lurie, ex-film critic and son of a political cartoonist. Most American movies act as if there are no parties. Even in political movies, characters seldom identify affiliations. The Contender has a political agenda, most clearly in the character of the GOP's Runyon, aptly a dishonorable power dealer. Whether you're sympathetic to the story might be determined by which you found more upsetting between the inquiry of the Republican counsel and Clinton's sidestepping efforts. In my opinion, I can conceive of myself, and nearly everybody else, responding as defensively as Clinton. However to ask Starr's questions, while they're no less human, have much more of an imposition on what the people are supposed to think about acceptable sex life, indeed designed to influence the people, and would've imbued me with repulsion at myself.Joan Allen turns in a very strong performance that should've made her name more familiar. Some actresses would've made the character too sensual, others too tough. Allen plays a woman with a vigorous physicality who all the same has an unbreakable moral code. She'd prefer to squander being VP than fulfill Runyon's immoral prying, and via her the movie, well, contends that we've gone overboard in our prying into the personal behavior of our public figures and have forgotten to separate privacy and policy, just as we have with other celebrities.Jeff Bridges plays Evans as a guy elected by seeming more easygoing and Southern-hospitality-style than he is. He's ceaselessly sending for food and urgently offering it around, in acts not so much of generosity as distractions. His top advisers, Sam Elliott and Saul Rubinek, have a snappish shorthand that indicates that they get the act but aren't fooled by it. And Christian Slater has a dodgy freshman Democratic representative ready to bargain his vote for a position on Runyon's committee.Oldman can play distinguished, mean, tactless, dignified. He vanishes into the character, with peeping spectacles, untamed mouth, wavy tresses teased over baldheadedness. He plays him as a guy with a stronger urge to know who's doing who than to do them himself. There are two illuminating scenes featuring his wife, who knows him more than anyone. If he's correct about Hanson, then he's not bad, just obnoxious. But even so, he's amiss, as he contested the nominee because of gender. Her history's purely a way of discrediting her. This is one of those infrequent movies where you come out having been startled and entertained, then begin debating. Or it could've been.It's at the conclusion where it has a completely unexpected crash. For a movie all about not copping out, Lurie does that with a breast-beating finale that falls somewhere between Path Adams' cloyingly uplifting lugubriousness and a maudlin stump-speech's romanticism, the impassioned rhetoric and emotional appeal I earlier criticized. It's hard to recall being let down so hard by a movie and makes me wonder if such a compromise was necessary to find it viable with such outright political views.

That's all the bad future I am dreaming humanity will offer themselves in the next few years, in the USA or in China, or in Europe, democracy in our homes and gardens and public squares. But remember a Shrine of Democracy has to be built in every home, in every school, in every village, in every neighborhood, and that will take more time and courage from everyone of us than just bouncing up and down in our seats and banging over and over again our hands on the tables, humming and repeating Red Alert!

Maybe since Ice Storm, certainly since Searching for Bobby Fischer (I'm a chess player) and I bet I will enjoy a lot of her earlier, more reputable films (Peggy Sue Got Married, for example) just as soon as I get around to seeing them, which has to wait until I've seen all the movies featuring Oscar-nominated performances (so a chess player has a completism fetish; imagine that). But in the line of checking that item off of my lifetime to-do list, I have just finished watching Ms. Allen's most recent nominated performance, that of an Ohio Senator nominated to replace a deceased Vice President, becoming the first woman to be one heartbeat away from the Oval Office. Oh, I had high hopes for this one. And they have been dashed.First, I don't know when the stakes were raised with regard to accuracy in the visual portrayal of all things related to the White House, but it was no later than The American President. But someone in this movie's production staff didn't get the memo. It may make a nice comic moment when, five minutes after the President has walked with his Veep nominee onto the front of the White House lawn to have a private conversation, he is finally rediscovered by a cadre of Secret Service agents, but the reality is the time between a president going missing and the Secret Service locking down the West Wing could be measured in seconds, not minutes. Not that reality is important, but that's also in the viewers' perception of White House security, and for me, this ludicrous scene was the most jarring of several that were inauthentic enough to wreck the narrative. The runner-up would be the two men sitting behind the President in his address to the Joint Houses. Those two men would be the Speaker of the House and the Vice President. Oh, wait -- the Vice President is dead? Okay, so maybe these wrong details are unfair quibbles. So let's talk about critical plot points. It turns out the Senator's husband's ex-wife divorced her because he had an affair with the Senator while they were married. Why does the script treat this easily accessible court file as if it were some national secret, only discovered after she was nominated for VP? I found the storyline, and the resolution in particular, unpersuasive. The bottom line is politicians are political animals. A Senator who has never compromised a principle to obtain political power is a noble beast; so is a unicorn. They are also both mythical creatures. John Kerry did not hesitate to go after the lying liars in the Swift-Rove Liars for Bush, and didn't hide behind any principles by failing to answer their lies. (Hmmm. Maybe Senator Hanson had a point.) Other parts of the story were totally implausible, such as the method Governor Hathaway used to try to move his name to the top of the Vice President candidate's list, and the idea that the audience was not supposed to see through the Special Agent's transparent investigation in the subplot.Of course, I liked Joan Allen, though I prefer her long-haired roles more. I thought Sam Elliot was miscast as the bulldog Chief of Staff for President Jeff Bridges; I kept imagining James Brolin in the role, channeling his excellent performance as Governor Ritchie from The West Wing.I notice that this movie gets relatively high marks. Perhaps it's because we've become more interested in political thrillers these days, but as President Shepherd told his aide, Lewis Rothschild, People don't drink the sand because they're thirsty. They drink the sand because they don't know the difference. Well, I apologize for that. It's not like me to attack the opinions of people who disagree with me.

I had heard good things about this film and taped it when it was shown on channel 4 (albeit confusingly late at night). From the very start the film is sharp, interesting and paints US politics as being full of dirty tricks and horse trading but it cannot manage to pull this off and often falls into being a bit too preachy at times and ultimately ends up being a bit of an anticlimax. The film needed to be sharp and prickly with a wry twist at each turn and it does manage this for some times but it does sag at times and didn't draw me in with substance that I was convinced by (in reality it would not be this tame). The script also put me off by clearly being written as a defence of Clinton and, even as a liberal, I need more than that to make a film work. In the end the film betrays reality by having one of those 'honest and upright' sentimental moments that also take the sheen off The West Wing when they do it. The film holds this off for almost two-thirds of its running time but then it falls into a preachy, unrealistic and off-putting conclusion that made me almost totally forget any sharp edge or intelligence that I may have seen in it prior to this point.It is a shame that the writing wasn't there because I did think that Lurie did a pretty good job as director, setting up some good shots and generally giving the film a very professional feel throughout. He is helped of course by a cast that would usually be reserved for a major director who has a history of getting his cast Oscars &#150; not a relative newcomer from a UK movie magazine (but I guess he made the right connections in his time). Oldman may not be the main character but he does steal the show somewhat. His character is let down by the ending but mostly with sly manipulation is convincing and engaging. Try as they might neither Bridges nor Allen could make me believe that these people exist within politics &#150; they were a fantasy like in the West Wing, but at least WW makes its fantasy have a bit of human fallibility. Petersen is good in his early scenes but his payoff is signposted from a mile or two away and is tiresome in its predictability &#150; not his fault, he does the best he can. Slater, Rubinek, Elliott, Hemingway and a few others all add to the sense of a product deep in quality and they are all OK even with not a great deal to do.Overall this is an OK film that is worth watching for what it tries to do and partly does succeed in doing. However not even the big name cast can do much with a plot that gradually forgets its promise as a look at political manipulating and dirty games and quickly becomes an attack on the treatment of Clinton before ending with a fairytale conclusion that would make even the most naïve liberal feel a little sickly from a saccharine overdose.

Plain biscuits for plain fare.Maybe living in a country who's head of State is a woman (The Queen)  and who longest serving Prime Minister  (Maggie T) was a woman has maybe made me a little isolated from the central point. What are the nay-sayers actually afraid of here? What real powers does a Vice President actually have? Equally you are entitled to not trust someone or believe that their politics don't fit in with their personal history. Naturally we are playing in the (male) director's liberal agenda sand pit and our  friends (loud cheer) are presented as cool, friendly and poised while the enemy (hearty boo) is sweaty, balding and heartless. When they (our friends) make one of those while a single child cries out  in the night speeches the violins go in to overdrive and the camera rises and  pans to reveal the suitably impressed faces. Naturally the critics are not given any chance to counter this wet dream vagary - more no time than equal time.(Yes we often have our emotions manipulated by movies - but here we have no subtlety. We are told what to think.)What is there to defend here? That an adult had sex in college while drunk? That she had an affair with a married person? Did that stop Reagan or Clinton getting a couple of terms in the main seat. The private life of John F Kennedy has been blown wide open - but that hasn't stopped him being voted the most popular American President of all time. Does America really care anymore about what happened twenty years ago behind closed doors?  I would doubt it, but I am not writing a movie that has to have conflict simply to create drama.  She is no example to anybody - despite her many speeches - she was prepared to devastate her best friend by running of with her husband. Or was she drunk when she did this too?There is nothing to really recommend this film. I cared little about anybody presented here  and I cared even less about the born with a silver spoon in her mouth protagonist. The person I feel most sorry for is Gary Oldman who had to ruin his perfectly good hairline to look more like a sad clown. It wasn't worth it.

She is accused of participating in a sexual orgy of sorts while a college freshman, which was supposedly documented.The film gives the impression that this past activity on her part was true, but because this sexual misconduct was by a woman, it will be treated differently than if it was a man.  Presumedly, a woman has as much right to be raunchy as a man.We finally see that the accusations against the woman candidate are untrue, but she will not defend herself because she thinks it is an off-limits area for discussion.  She comes across as a quite unattractive Vice-Presidential candidate.  If she was just a bit more feisty, she could have honestly denied involvement, called them lies, and challenged everyone to find the true story.  However, she seems so repressed and unwilling to do this that the supposedly ennobling effect of her conduct falls flat.  She is in the end vindicated, with the President refusing to accept her withdrawal, and she gets to stick by her principles of not publicly defending herself.One tries to think of an ennobling character in the movie, but if there was one, I must have missed it.A cynical, bleak view of politics.

Would have gotten an F but I think a lot of that was written that way.Lack of Realism Part I - Writing (F)Pedestrian at best.  If I were to give Rod Lurie the benefit of the doubt, I would say that he had a great idea but then dumbed it down too much so that it would appeal to the masses, but I am not inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.  The style was very much like that of the Aaron Sorkin/Rob Reiner collaboration on The American President (i.e. preachy and revealing of the writer's personal ideology to a fault) but the actual shaping of characters and events in Contender gave the impression that it was written by a 12 year old.Elder statesmen were written as if they were just some dumb rubes who suddenly found themselves in a position of influence and power.  Lurie gave no nod to the political prowess it would have surely taken to get there (the best example of this is Oldman's part as Runyon, though Bridges', Elliott's, and Allen's characters are also terrible).The events that are unrealistically written are also too numerous to elaborate on the problems with each.  The one I would most like to elaborate on is a spoiler, so I will refrain.  But I will comment that the speech that the President gives to a joint session of Congress not only lacks integrity with regard to the substance of the speech, but also with the procedural demands that the President makes.Lack of Realism Part II - Sets (F)The oval office was similar to what we have been fed over the years that the Oval Office looks like, but seemed to be a good deal too small.  However, the scene outside the White House on the lawn shows a steep embankment right beside the entrance which simply does not exist.Further, the joint session of Congress takes place in a hall that, while having some similar features to the Senate chamber (i.e. approximate size and white walls), is clearly not the Senate chamber (no desks, large windows behind the dais, etc.)  That is beside the point though, since they could have filmed it IN the Senate chamber and it still would not have resembled a joint session of Congress.  Those take place in the House Chamber (far bigger and browner than the Senate chamber).  The Senate chamber would not fit all the Senators and Congressman, not to mention all the other officials and guests who show up for those sorts of things.Cinematography (D)The camera was far too active a player in this film.  In tense conversations, rather than show both actors or cut from one to another, the camera panned back and forth between the two as if it were a tennis match. It certainly made me wish I was at home watching a tennis match rather than spending $7.50 to see this (and I don't even like tennis).

Apparently Hannity and some of the other light weights at Fox have succeeded in convincing some that the word liberal is a swear word.This movie, a pathetic piece of pontification, has nothing to do with liberal, conservative, Democrat or Republican, it is a statement of blatant amorality (look it up) by its writer, Mr. Lurie, who was making his statement. It was arrogant and insulting to the viewer, a voter, who could believe this scenario could ever take place.A screenplay requires a strong beginning. It had that with Gov. Hathaway diving from his small fishing boat to save the driver of a vehicle that had conveniently driven through a guard rail on the bridge above into the waters below. It requires a strong ending to be supported by a solid middle leading us (via uncontrived Plot points) to an ending that profound and realistic.Like Victor Borge with his sheet music upside down and playing the piece backwards, Mr.Lurie attempted the same. He had the ending with no middle nor beginning. His plot points were outrageous in a clumsy attempt to have the means justify the end.We have an arrogant President(Jeff Bridges) who will not listen to any sound advice. He wants his legacy to be one of having shoved through the first woman to the presidency rather than the electorate voting her in. The consensus candidate is the fisherman, Gov Hathaway,(Wm Petersen) beloved by both sides of the aisle and a shoe in for confirmation. But no, this slapstick President, unlike Bill Clinton's best woman for the Attorney General's job,(Not best person) is compelled to nominate the worst woman for the job against all rational judgement.

If, as viewers and voters, we question his remaining sanity, and are outraged that this stunt can be pulled off at our expense, he has one more putrid pill for us to swallow. She is also a card carrying atheist.Lurie needs one final contrived plot point. The president has Gov Hathaway arrested for having paid off a young woman to drive through a guard rail and off a bridge so that our hero could save her when his credentials did not require an act of heroism. Where, oh where could he find a woman so stupid as to drive off a bridge where the guard rail could have killed her, or where the Gov's outboard could have quit a mile short of the meeting place, or with a lack of understanding that you don't drop a radio into a bath tub as water being a conductor of electricity will short out the power door locks and windows, which would have precluding her escape.

And yet it manages to shoot itself in the foot nearly every time. Which is surprising given it's title character's stance on gun control. She claims she wants every gun removed from every home, period. And then talks about Freedoms in nearly the same breath. If that isn't the proverbial double standard this film purports to be against I don't know what is. First disarm every Criminal & Cop, every Soldier & Savage, Every Villain & Vigilante, then ask The American Citizen to set their arms aside. But they'd better set them aside very close by in case the job wasn't thorough. Even one of the film's own stars railed against this film and refused to give the director the shot he wanted because he knew that was the one he'd use. Can you blame him? The movie was nominated for several awards, but won only one. Broadcast Film Critics Association Award. No surprise there -- and damned few in the film itself. The performances are however first rate, even if the dialogue is, at times, third rate at best. It's like a second rate Oliver Stone movie, only more preachy and pretentious, if that's even possible. If, on the other hand, you're a far left liberal who demonizes anyone else with an opposing view, you will find this very uplifting. If you are anyone else, you still appreciate that Jeff Bridges can be The Dude one minute and The President the next, with Sam Elliot's Stranger thrown in for good measure. Or better yet, just watch The Big Lebowski instead. It will teach you more about Life & America in one scene, than this entire aggrandized propagandized film.

Some very good acting by Joan Allen (the only thing that can be saved from this nightmare), Sam Elliot and Gary Oldman, and maybe the worst performance by Jeff Bridges. Some characters (Rep. Webster, Special Agent Willomina) are simply abominable. The whole situation is so ridiculous, that one wonders what kind of feverish imagination would place somebody as wildly liberal, disloyal, contradictory, and confused as Senator Laine Hanson in such a high position. I loved Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. It was straight and honest, concise and well taken. The Contender is exactly the opposite in all respects. I give it a 3 / 10 out of respect for Joan Allen.

The hypocrisy is so thick that I couldn't watch it at times.. It was a typical good guys D vs bad guys R political movie where they find some kind of hidden agenda on the part of the R's and total clear moral behavior on the part of the D's.. Then there's the young (looks like she just left high school) female FBI agent who saves the day and has her own moral Axe to grind.. it just got old. There was no real deep plot, twist or anything that you couldn't see coming from a mile away.the only good thing was the acting was OK...

It has concocted a tale based on a very crude need to invert reality and retell the 90's upside down and inside out.  In THE CONTENDER, the vice-presidential slot has become open and a female Democrat nominee is assailed by the Republicans, mostly on the basis of sexual charges.  The Republicans are not patriots or believers in good government and individual rights.  No, in Lurie's version their motivation is just nasty meanness. The Democrats are saintly and do not respond to the charges because of their high principles.In short, It is the pure opposite of the reality in which the Republicans were motivated by real concerns about the corruption of the country's leadership and the Democrats responded to all charges with smear campaigns against anyone who dared to speak the truth in public.The movie climaxes (pun intended) with a triumphant Democrat president humiliating his Republican opponent by asking if he has no shame.The crudity of this exercise in psychological masturbation is really amazing.  I feel embarrassed for the people who made it and the people who affect to find it praiseworthy.Bob  "},{"Title":"A political masterpiece!","Date":"13 October 2000","Score":"18 out of 39 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  When a politican is placed into a new position, there will be people who support their new title.  Then there are those who will oppose. What is sad is that in modern times there are the people who oppose who will do whatever they can to prevent that politican to be elected.  In the new political thriller THE CONTENDER, that is what the story is, but it's also a story of kicking someone when they are already down on the groung. President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) has left the country guessing on who will replace the former vice-president who passed away a few weeks eariler.  Most politicans and news reporters speculate that the nominee will be Governer Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen).  But President Evans surprises the nation by nominating Ohio Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen). A majority of the women in the U.S. are excited that finally a female is in a high political position.  And the male democrats are also pleased because of her political viewpoints.  However, there are some male politicans who are not happy to see Senator Hanson take the Vice President chair, espcially Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) who is in charge of a committee who must confirm Senator Hanson's appointment.  Shelly enlists a young congressman, Reginald Webster (Christian Slater) to investigate the past history of Senator Hanson, particularly the scandals. While President Evans has his two aids, Kermin Newman (Sam Elliott) and Jerry Tolliver (Saul Rubinek) work around and try to respond to the scandals of Hanson's past so she can still get the public support and the nomination. THE CONTENDER is a film with little action, and it's mostly dialogue scenes for over two hours.  Yet, this two hour film will grab onto the viewer's attention for it's film length, making the time go by very very very fast.  I was hooked onto this film from the opening scene, and the next thing I realize, the film was already over!  This political movie, like the Oliver Stone classic JFK, went by so quickly because the subject and characters are so fascinating that you think this was a documentary. This is one brillant masterpiece film that deals with politics that it will be ranked among MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, and THE CANDIDATE.  It is more political fact than fiction, yet this is a story that was written for the screen.  The message of this movie is, although you do not agree with the political viewpoints of a candidate, should you do whatever you can to destroy them?  Including publicize that candidate's personal past that will humiliate and emotionally scar that person forever.  And bring out to the public a past that one would like to forget, to that one's family, friends, fellow workers, and the population of the world.  THE CONTENDER asks the viewer those questions, and also asks the viewer, if you were that person being investigated what could you do? I was really amazed on how much of a excellent thriller THE CONTENDER was.  The acting by it's cast also made the film more realistic and exciting.  Joan Allen is fantastic as the role of the Senator who is the victim of this sexual witchhunt.  I thought Julia Roberts in ERIN BROCKOVICH was a shoe-in for Best Actress.  But she might lose due to the performance given by Joan Allen, and I personally would like to see Allen get the Oscar. Gary Oldman is at his villainous best in this film.  Unlike his villian roles in BRHAM STROKER'S DRACULA and AIR FORCE ONE, his role of Shelly Runyon is cruel and vicious as he not only wants to knock down a opponent but also destory the opponent's life forever.  Oldman plays Runyon calm and cool, but his words and actions are similar to a madman.  Jeff Bridges is also excellent as the president who despite his candidate's past, still believes that his nominee is worthy of the title and stands by his belief. Sam Elliott is great as well as the political aid who is frustrated by the information that Runyon is releasing to the public, and is trying to either cover up or debate the scandal issues being brought up.  And Christian Slater is at his best as the young and ambitious political congressman who will do whatever he can to get into a higher office, yet is blinded by his own ambition. Director/writer Rod Lurie does a marvelous job with this film, by creating a story that would have appeared to be based on a true story, but it isn't.  Although it does have similar echoes to the President Clinton/Monica Lewensky scandal two years ago.  And Lurie's pacing of this film is fast and captivating.  Lurie along with Cameron Crowe deserves a nomination for Best Director, but he deserves to win a Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.  His screenplay is so brilliant, his character's have extraordinary discussions between each other.  My favorite's where the lunch scene between Allen and Oldman.  And the White House gallery scene between Bridges and Slater. Along with the other fantastic films that Dreamworks SKG has released this year, GLADIATOR, CHICKEN RUN, and ALMOST FAMOUS; THE CONTENDER proves that Dreamworks is the studio of the 21st Century.  I am pleased that Steven Spielberg is seeing Dreamworks as a studio who releases fantastic films, and not just popcorn fluff.   And I would be very curious to hear what real politicans reactions are to this film.  I can see them saying that this film is pure Hollywood nonsense, but how can it be since it does seem so real? THE CONTENDER along with ALMOST FAMOUS and GLADIATOR will probably be among the films nominated for best picture for this year.  And whoever is greenlighting these films for Dreamworks, I feel deserves a very HUGE raise.  It seems that Dreamworks is stomping out it's competition for the quality of films it's releasing this year.  It's time that other studios take Dreamworks more seriously now.  As for THE CONTENDER, if ALMOST FAMOUS doesn't get nominated for Best Picture, then I feel THE CONTENDER should get nominated and win!  THIS FILM IS A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!! ***** (out of five) "},{"Title":"Strictly political preaching","Date":"30 May 2005","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" The trailer and box lead you to think this is some kind of thriller. I suppose they had to do that because most people would not want to sit through a way over-extended and even more boring version of West Wing. This movie is nothing but screamingly partisan politics. There is nothing even remotely tense about it. It's one of the most glaringly preachy flicks I've seen outside a Michael Moore film. If you're the type that can sit through a 24 hour Worst Wing marathon I suppose you might like it. If you're a devout Republican it'll set your hair on fire. If you're a devout Democrat you'll buy dozens of copies and give them to all your Republican friends, just to see their hair catch fire. The other 90% of us will just be offended. The movie was made right after the Clinton/Monica fiasco and the parallels are as thinly veiled as you'll find. Joan Allen plays a candidate for Vice President whose sordid sexual past catches up with her and she is run through the ringer by those evil Republicans led by Gary Oldmans Newt Gingrich clone. The worst part about the movie is not the obvious parallels with current events, but the characters themselves. Not to sound too partisan here, but anyone to the right of Abby Hoffman is portrayed as pure distilled evil. Each character is an insulting caricature of each side of the political class in this country. And not a caricature in a humorous sense, but in the same way Jimmy Swaggert might describe Hugh Hefner. The movie is for those few of us who weren't already sick of hearing news heads ask whether Clinton left the Presidential Seal on Monicas dress.

I could only vaguely remember it being on at the theaters, and after seeing it was shocked that it garnered no Academy Award nominations.  It should have been nominated for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Actress (Joan Allen), Best Actor (Gary Oldman), and possibly a few other categories.  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a few years.  I ranked it a 9 out of a possible 10.  This is an eye-opener of a movie that takes you inside the halls of power in Washington, D.C., and shows the type of power-plays, personal agendas, and shenanigans that occur in the highest levels of government.  It is also a powerful story about personal ethics, honor, commitment, and beliefs.  This is a story that will make you want to stand up and cheer after the President's (Beau Bridges) final speech, near the end of the movie.  Joan Allen was as good, or better than she was in All The Rage, and that is really saying something.  Gary Oldman was incredibly good as the Senator and Minority Leader.  He is a master of language in that he can drop his English accent and play a Yank with complete believability.  He was as good in this movie as he was in The Professional, even though he played a character who was almost diametrically opposed to the crazed, drug-using cop of that movie.  He has the same kind of range as Tim Curry, who starred in such diverse films as The Rocky Horror Picture Show; Clue; Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition; The Hunt for Red October, and on and on. Sam Elliott, usually seen as a hard-bitten cowboy, or rough-and-tumble character, really surprised me by being cast in the role as the President's right-hand-man.  I wouldn't have thought he could be believable in a part requiring him to wear a three-piece suit.  Beau Bridges was great, as usual.  The script/dialogue was extremely well done.  Acting, music, directing, plot, screenplay, and everything else was top notch.  If you haven't seen this movie, go rent it tonight! "}]
