Should your friends belittle the story as formulaic and the ending as too easy, ignore them. They have missed the richness of the flow of events in this movie that portrays a more repressed world where women (and, to a lesser degree, men) had different and more limited options and necessarily pursued their opportunities differently. This movie was so well done, it leaves you wishing it were an hour longer.

Sophie Marceau is a beautiful governess, who seven years prior was hired by a rich Englishman to conceive a baby because the man's own wife had been seriously injured but did not die after a riding accident.  Marceau's motivation is to pay her father's debts and get him out of prison.  Thus the two principal characters are having this weekend affair  out of a sense of duty to others.  Unlike many movies set in the mid-19th century, the rich people in this movie are not one dimensional and heartless, and the poor people are not powerless victims.  Marceau manages to track down her child after 6 years and becomes her governess. The girl has become a spoiled brat, and Marceau is the first to teach the girl how to read, and much about life.  There is not exactly a happy ending, in the Hollywood sense.  In order to get something, one must take risks and be willing to give up other things.

Some will love it, and some will hate it. I have given it five stars out of ten, just to place myself precisely in the middle. For quality it is worth more, and because it may be construed as condoning aspects of immoral behaviour, less. Whether it does actually condone that which is wrong is open to debate. So, too, is the matter of predictability. Are you expecting blissful lovers to disappear into a glorious sunset?For this period drama, you do have to suspend reality and accept the parameters required for the film to work. We are asked to believe that, way back in the first half of the nineteenth century, a comatose woman, seemingly unable even to blink, would have survived for years, and still have significant life expectancy. Medical science makes such a thing possible in our time, but how would the patient have been fed in those days? Don't let such considerations put you off. For other titles, we accept time travel, real people living inside computer memory, oriental gentlemen waving scimitars who run up vertical walls and jump over tall buildings, and still enjoy the show.Sophie Marceau's acting was outstanding. Who would have thought that Elisabeth Laurier in 'Firelight' and Lila Dubois in 'Lost & Found' were played by the same person? Stephen Dillane, playing Charles Godwin, was more than adequate as the other main lead. The rest of the characters were well cast, each contributing significantly to this very moving tale. 'Firelight' covers part of the lives of two essentially principled people trying to find a way through the distressing circumstances with which each was faced. If they took a wrong turn, which of us is going to throw the first stone? Judgment of every individual is God's prerogative. If this film does nothing else, it does show why there is a debate about euthanasia. I had two special adult friends outside our immediate family early in life, one as a child and one as a youth. Both had flaws in their characters, but were excellent mentors. I chose to adopt some of their traits, but not others. A couple of years past retirement age, I bought my first television, and have since discovered films. I find these very instructive, giving me insights into the human condition which I would not have otherwise. As with my mentors, I am using my discrimination when assessing any messages suggested by each movie. I found 'Firelight' emotionally stimulating, its characters eminently admirable in many respects, but used my beliefs and discretion in determining the validity of any moral that may be inferred from its plot. Isn't this what we all do?Some review comments seem to be denigrating Charles Godwin unfairly. It was Lord Clare who ruined the estate by his profligacy. Charles, on the other hand, was trying to keep the boat afloat as a sheep farmer. To suggest that Charles viewed Elisabeth as little more than a chattel doesn't ring true with me. I gained the impression that he was considering her as well as himself right from the beginning. I also felt that their motives tended towards the welfare of others rather than their own selfish ends. The firelight allegory might also be less simplistic than is being suggested. If I am recalling events correctly, I thought the initial use was to introduce a plot continuity. This was progressed to a vehicle used by Elisabeth to allow her daughter the opportunity to break free of her antagonistic attitudes. At some point, the firelight rekindled a significant memory. Finally, for Amy, the firelight was conspicuous by its absence. Were the words, May God have mercy on us, just a common expression, or were they spoken from the heart? Judge for yourself.I looked for the DVD, hoping that it would have an audio commentary. Guess what? Buena Vista has allowed the title to become currently 'out of print', so I couldn't even buy the film itself (!) That surprised me, considering the number of reviewers and the high average rating. I'm looking forward to seeing this film again, but will have to wait for it to come around once more on TV. Do keep an eye open for it in your programme guides. If and when it appears, it's well worth watching.

Elisabeth must renounce to all claims of the baby. What starts as a pure sex, with Elisabeth suffering quietly while Charles has his way with her, suddenly turns into pleasure, seen on the young woman's face.Imagine Charles' horror when he returns from a trip to find out his sister-in-law Constance, has engaged Elisabeth as his daughter's governess. Louisa, who has terrorized previous attempts at receiving an education, rebels against this new stranger. Since by this time Charles' wealth has suffered a reverse, and having assured a moth's wages to Elisabeth, he consents in her staying. Charles' wife who is sick, is dying a slow death. It's inevitable that Elisabeth will have an effect on Charles and that she will be able to tame the wild Louisa into accepting her.William Nicholson, who wrote and directed Firelight, created a film of great beauty. As it is, there are elements of other, better made movies, within the screen play, although it makes good entertainment. Nic Morris' cinematography gives the picture a glossy look that is appealing to the eye. Christopher Gunning's musical score serves the movie well.Sophie Marceau, an actress of great beauty makes an impression as Elisabeth.

Godwin crosses the English Channel where Elisabeth Laurier (Sophie Maureau) responds to his ad for a surrogate mother. From the very beginning there's strong chemistry between them, which is partly why he hires her. She needs the money to help her father, who's in prison.Godwin chooses three days to be with Elisabeth, presumably based on some sense of when she'll be fertile, and they meet at a resort hotel on the coast of England. The second night the chemistry between them ignites and -- by the third night -- they're madly in love. However, they dutifully repress their feelings and keep their business bargain. Godwin goes home and leaves her to have the baby.Elisabeth gives birth to a baby girl who's taken from her before she even sees it. Since she's in love with the absent father, it's not hard to imagine what her pregnancy was like, nor the intense deprivation she experiences when both father and baby are lost to her. The scene fades from the image of the ivy growing outside the room where she gave birth to a watercolor painting of ivy, and then uses imagery from Elisabeth's painting/diary to keep track of her growing attachment for her daughter.When the story switches back to Godwin, we're introduced to his father and also to an American sheep farmer who eventually proposes to Elisabeth. Godwin's father is a member of the aristocracy, and a profligate rake and spendthrift who has serial very-public love affairs. We learn that Godwin's wife is comatose after a riding accident that took place shortly after their marriage.Godwin is a complex and intriguing character, and Stephen Dillane plays him to perfection. Dillane is so charismatic in this film that it makes me want to jump through the screen screaming! To my mind, the only performance that rivals Dillane's repressed but smoldering 19th century British-ness is Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.For Dillane's outstanding performance -- and all of the film's outstanding performances -- we have to thank William Nicholson's excellent writing and direction, along with the almost mystical cinematography of Nic Morris. As writer/director, Nicholson exploits the medium of film to do what only film can do, and that's weave a narrative subtext that propels the story through inter-dimensional dreamlike symbolism. The accessible and yet subtle over-riding metaphor of firelight is carried throughout the film starting from the first moment when Godwin and Elisabeth are alone together. Godwin says something like, I didn't realize that fire cast so much light. Do you mind? This consideration for Elisabeth's modesty in such an awkward situation sparks the first sympathy between them. From that moment, it gets more and more difficult for them to pretend that they're just there for business. Unwittingly, Godwin repeats the same sentence when they're alone together seven years later. Firelight and love are synonymous. The subtext about human relationships -- especially relationships between husband and wife, children and parents-- is also explored through the imagery of Elisabeth's desire to shout, the boathouse in the lake, breeding sheep, the estate, the sister-in-law (another exquisitely convincing performance by Lia Williams), Godwin's father, Elisabeth's family history, etc. Everything in this film is essential to a fully realized three-dimensional portrait of human relationships, and there's nothing extra. The film-making is just plain masterful.And did I mention the costumes?The best films go beyond the capacity of words to convey meaning. Sometimes half- remembered dreams leave us with a wordless understanding that evaporates like steam if we try too hard to explain it. For me, this film goes beyond words to convey meaning in the same way that dreams do. Elisabeth shows up at Godwin's estate seven years after she gives birth to accept a position as governess to their daughter. Her interactions as incognito motherteacher with beloved spoiled-child Luisa (another fine performance by Dominique Belcourt) are nothing short of poignant. There's a mini-Miracle Worker going on here. The scene were Godwin fights Elisabeth for the key to the schoolroom is incredible.The other aspect that resonates with me personally is what this film says about the plight of women in 19th century Europe and how the exceptional courage and intelligence of one woman who believes in herself can overcome the hardship of circumstances. Women are only fifty percent of the human race but our issues as a subgroup of mankind have to take a back seat to all of the other subgroups where males are fighting other males for dominance with the common denominator that they all subjugate women. I love the scene where Elisabeth convinces her daughter that education is the only way out of spiritual prison for a woman. I have always admired Sophie Marceau but she really goes beyond herself in this film, thanks to the exceptional script, direction, cinematography, costumes, and performances of her fellow actors. A beautiful and accomplished actress rises to the occasion of portraying a beautiful and accomplished woman struggling to survive in exceptional circumstances.At first, we're confused about Elisabeth's appearance at Godwin's estate to become governess to his adopted daughter. When they met seven years before he had to hide his identity, so we never know if or how she finds out his name. However, Elisabeth eventually confesses that it took her seven years to find him, so we know that the narrative is driven by her desire and intentions. The moment when Godwin asks her if she regrets this is among the best in screen history, in my opinion. Since increasingly films live beyond their time, I have no doubt that someday this masterpiece will be viewed as a major film classic.

Sophie Marceau (the French princess in Braveheart) plays a Swiss governess named Elizabeth in late 1830s England. Desperate to pay a family debt, she sells herself to an anonymous English gentlemen for three days in his efforts to produce an heir for his family. Harsh and uncaring at first, they fall in love, but both have agreed never to see or speak to each other again for the sake of keeping up appearances. Elizabeth conceives a baby girl who is wisked away seconds after birth. Heartbroken, Elizabeth writes letters to My English Daughter until she can no longer keep her promise. Seven years after the baby's birth she tracks the child down; now a spoiled brat living on a remote Sussex estate. The daughter acts up as she pines for her usually absent father. Her father's wife has been in a vegetative state for a decade after a riding accident, and even the the daughter knows she is not the real mother. Elizabeth takes a job as the girl's governess to be close to her, unbeknownst to the girl's father. When the father, Charles Godwin, returns from London he is appalled at the mother of his child showing up again in his life as well as the rekindling of a romantic fire he has desperately tried to convince himself is long burnt out. Themes of duty to family, maternal love, and desperate attempts to hold back passion are played out in perpetually foggy and snowswept landscapes and around fireplaces in the Godwin Victorian mansion.Performances by the actors are uniformly excellent. Marceau and Stephen Dillane as Charles Godwin share a chemistry rarely captured on film; but also look for Dominique Belcourt as the daughter; Lia Williams as Godwin's long-suffering sister-in-law; Kevin Anderson as the visiting American who falls for Elizabeth; and veteran British actor Joss Ackland as Godwin's father whose self-indulgent hedonism dooms the family to ruin. It's never apparent that this is Nicholson's first time out as a director. Nic Morris's cinematography of the English countryside and Marceu's exquisitely beautiful face lit by firelight is something to see, and Christopher Gunning's string-laden score is dramatic and over-the-top which it really should be.Although rife with gray and icy colors, painful family obligation, stark settings, heartbreak, euthanasia, held back emotions, and rigid social mores; the underlying theme of the Firelight is that true love conquers all. It's never really gotten the attention it deserves.Released by Disney's Hollywood pictures, the movie played briefly in American arthouses back in 1998 and was released on VHS the next year to very little fanfare. Disillusioned, Nicholson never directed a picture again, although he hit paydirt when he co-wrote the script to Ridley Scott's Gladiator in 2000. Firelight has been sporadically available since then on demand on the Encore movie cable channel. A Region 0 bare-bones DVD was released in Hong Kong of all places; it's available on Amazon.com and ebay. If you find a copy, it's definitely worth purchasing.

Here, I found out that many people think the same.Searching the web, as I said, I also ran across the director's statement that I cite hereInspired by Nicholson's fascination with 1940s movie love stories, Firelight is a film that awakens the romantic spirit in each of us. For his film directorial debut, Nicholson wanted to create a boundless romantic story about lovers forced apart by outside forces. To do so, he had to set his story in another place and time. To achieve that old-fashioned level of romance, the writer/director asserts, I had to go back to a place and time when there were forces stronger than individual desires. Contemporary love stories are relationship stories because the obstacles that prevent people from loving each other are essentially self-induced. These kind of stories can be charming, but you can't build up an enormous head of steam with them. I wanted to create a story about how love can redeem people, about how it can totally change their lives. I wanted to create that tragic feeling you have when two people are perfect for each other, love each other, but yet cannot have one another. Nicholson set out to write a film in which the focus was on people and their emotions. As he worked on the screenplay, Nicholson developed a very clear and simple visual style for the film. I wanted people's feelings to be the central issue of the film and I wanted nothing to distract from that. The idea of firelight became central to what the film is about. The story is about light, about winter, about coldness and empty rooms where the eye goes toward the one source of heat, the fire.To conceive a good film is one thing, but to make it, is altogether different, sometimes very hard. Nicholson succeeded fantastically but praises must be given to all the cast as well, Sophie first.

It's not high-tech special effects, extravagant sets or costumes or the scenic flowery locations that create the visual beauty but rather the simplicity of it that is beautifully captured by the camera. It is the subtlety and gentle treatment that creates an atmosphere that is cold or warm. Notice though in the scenes where the temperature is supposed to be freezing, there is a coldness between the characters but the scenes with the firelight reflect a warmth in the characters. The story itself is pretty simple. There is hardly any 'main' conflict that drives the story. Any plot device that is presented is almost immediately resolved like Elisabeth getting Louisa to study, Charles giving Elisabeth a one-month notice and then falling for her. The movie moves at a rapid pace but Nicholson has handled the sequences quite well because none of it looks rushed. The love scenes were tastefully shot.The acting is excellent. An incredibly beautiful Sophie Marceau does a phenomenal job. Stephan Dillane too does an equally convincing job. The supporting cast is good too.'Firelight' is not without its share of loopholes. For example, considering that the film is set in the 1800s, how did they manage to maintain a comatose patient so well in seemingly such good health? Regarding the death sequence, why was such a cruel form of euthanasia, by having the victim freeze to death, chosen? The happy ending also feels a bit awkward but that may be because one would normally expect a tragic solution.In short, 'Firelight' is a worthy film because of its visual and poetic beauty. I am very picky about romantic films and loath movies such as 'Titanic' but if the movie has something more than pretty props to offer, something that is both visually enticing and lyrical then I am ready to give it my time.

Her determination to be with her spoiled and lonely daughter is really enjoyable to watch, her passion to be with the a man that she loved all of time is really memorable, her strong character really helped a lot here. The whole setting which was located in England was perfect to show the intimidation of society, however even the rules of society and time cannot forbid their love to be rekindled again.

Firelight is an exceptional movie that I first saw and then saw again, and again and again recently (2006) on TV. I am not a Gothic romance admirer. One part that hit home was the history of efforts by Luisa to drive away governesses. The author (Nicholson) knew what he was writing. Having lost my wife when one son was almost five years old, my housekeepers were of short duration. One day, I came home from work to find the housekeeper ready to leave after my four year old had chased her down the street with a butcher knife. His statement was I chased the other housekeepers away, and I will chase any more housekeepers away, until my father brings home a step-mother.Unknowing viewers probably missed this point. What a magnificent picture so well suited to being staged in the 1800s. Photography continued to improve as I watched the show on Encore as did the script, as did my admiration for the actors, the music, but most of all for the director. One viewing fails to show the greatness of the film.To earn $786,000 in the U.S. shows the commercial results of poor marketing. This has to be one of the best cinematic ventures in years.

The entire cast give strong performances--Stephen Dillane and Sophie Marceau make an appealing couple and, as their daughter, Dominique Bellacourt is a realistic brat. The relationships they form with one another feel emotionally true in a way I rarely find in films. The non-verbals are important in this film--the script is spare. Don't examine the plot too carefully--you might get cranky over details that are really irrelevant. It's a film for the heart, not the head.

So you're here in the theater and...there's Sophie Marceau walking onto the screen and into your heart. Just like that. Took me about 5 seconds. In deep, over my head. Irreversible crush. This must happen to every male on the planet when he watches his first Sophie Marceau movie. Oh yeah, there is a movie, in case you didn't notice. In this case it's a nicely-written, superbly-directed, well-acted flick about a governess (Sophie) who seeks the daughter she gave up for adoption 6 years previously. She applies for the position of governess, and is hired by the girl's father's sister-in-law (still with me?) before the father discovers who Sophie is. What follows is her attempt to win both the hearts of her long-lost daughter (who's turned out to be a major brat) and the father. It's a nice story, although the sister-in-law ends up getting a raw deal (does anyone notice?). But let's move on to more important matters. For those of you that worship the ground that Sophie treads upon, this film definitely delivers. She not only acts up a storm but also steams up the screen with her passion and sensuality. This she accomplishes which such finesse, such subtlety. Nothing against Americans, but Sophie proves how superior European (especially French) actresses can be when it comes to on-screen seduction of the male audience. She makes it look so easy. Okay, so I'm gushing. But that's the way it is when you experience such a revelation as I have I saw my first Sophie Marceau movie. What more need be said?

The movie is sure sexy but that was not its big appeal to me. It is really about child-raising - handling spoiled brats, reaching them, turning them around, teaching good values. It is also about parenthood - the instincts that drive us, love for our own children. It is about marriage - the loyalty we owe our spouse, the sort of person we might marry and be happy with. It it also about education - how a child learns to read and the need to be educated. But what I found most interesting was how the big advances in relationships happened when the mother/daughter and then the mother/father were set free of normal behavioral constraints... this only happened when they had a fire going in the fireplace (firelight) and when time stops still and what happens never really happened. People were freed to express themselves honestly and that is when the relationships changed. Perhaps Las Vegas's new advertising theme, What Happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas, was inspired by this movie... but I don't think Las Vegas is looking for growth in human relationships! This movie is very satisfying, and it is happy... leaving the viewer upbeat about family and life.

In Switzerland, her father has been imprisoned and her family is destitute. She is answering an ad about a wealthy English landowner who needs an heir, but whose wife is in a vegetative state (and she has been for many years.) The young woman agrees to sleep with the gentleman for several nights in order to get pregnant, stay in England thru her pregnancy, and then give him the baby when it is born. In return, she will receive from him a great sum of money -- a small fortune -- the money she needs to get her father out of prison and get her family back on its feet again. All of this will be done in absolute secrecy and anonymity... they agree not to even learn each others' names, for the sake of his reputation.Doesn't this sound intriguing? It IS!

This film merits great consideration. It reflects the English cultural way of life of the 1800's, a way of living, albeit in the upper middle classes and aristocracy that provided a fundament to the American society and that still survives in thin layers of Englnad. This English personality is united with a cool realistic and monetary Swiss attitude to life. An English heir (Stephen Dillane, played with great sensitivity) to a lord (Jon Ackland, epitomizing the spendthrift lords seeking only pleasure) resides in a lovely house and park with pond and bathing hut in glass. But he needs himself an heir. He pays the debt of a Swiss women owed for her father. She agrees as her part of the agreement to give birth to his child. The women is portrayed superbly by Sophie Marceau with the Swiss minimum of facial expression and restraint. A Swiss behaviour that is still noticed to-day. She arrives seven years after the birth of their child to reply to his need for a gouvernant for the child. Thus one learns a lot about some very impotent facets of the future make up of America moral rectitude, the work ethic, how to bring up children, the appreciation of natural beauty, the restarting of ones life. Most important is the sensitivity to sensual forces repressed but released when needed conception of a child despite being contracted for money, love eternal for a wife that is paralyzed, love of a mother for the best development of her child, the demand that love will be the force that unites the parents of the child and in the end the future for all three. Even euthanasia. Ironically, but so often the case, the heir has to sell his lovely house and grounds to pay off the debt of his father. Thus he and the mother of his child find themselves in the same quandary. The photography of the English countryside in autumn and winter is for dreams. A film to be seen and savoured several times.

That one word best describes this movie, which is without question one of the worst that I have ever seen.  Words like banal, trite and cliche do not even begin to do it justice.  Every line of dialogue was poorly written and even more poorly executed, and every shot was bleak, depressing and unartistic.  The movie was completely and totally predictable from the get-go, and offered no surprises and zero entertainment.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE for watching this movie.  Plot devices were inserted often to try and save a failing script, but to no avail.  I wish someone had held the original manuscript over a Firelight before ever taking it to a producer. "}]
