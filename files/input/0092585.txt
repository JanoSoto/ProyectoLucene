[{"Title":"Probably done for fun","Date":"25 September 2005","Score":"19 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" This was the next to last film appearance by Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. Ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then-husband David McCallum in 1967, beginning her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the all-time leader in number of deaths rendered on-screen, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history.'Assassination' seems to be a movie that was tucked into Cannon's production schedule for the sake of Bronson and Ireland. Ireland was already suffering from cancer-related illnesses in 1987 and you can almost picture the two actors wanting to do 'just one more, for old times' sake.' 'Assassination' is carelessly done as a whole, showing the lack of polish and dwindling funds that would tank Cannon by 1990. But there's a kind of nostalgia value in seeing the couple together one last time and the film makes you wonder what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is Hollywood.Bronson plays Jay Killian, a high-ranking Secret Service agent who is assigned to protect the First Lady, Lara Craig (Ireland). The President's wife has a reputation for being difficult, bossing Service agents around and wanting to do things her own way. That all changes, however, when attempts are made on her life and she must journey with Killian by car, train, motorbike, and believe it or not, dune buggy to escape would-be assassins. There is little surprise here, as Killian believes the murderers are part of an inside job, perhaps arranged by the President himself. On the way, Killian and Mrs. Craig develop an unspoken affection for one another in scenes between Bronson and Ireland that are actually very funny.What really gets me is how this film was promoted upon its release and how it's still made to look as a DVD. The original trailer gives you the feeling that 'Assassination' is another cold-hearted Bronson shoot-'em-up. But a lot of this movie - which was rated PG-13, by the way - is in a comic vein, putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like Bronson and Ireland's western 'From Noon Till Three.' Even the DVD case shows Bronson with a rocket launcher, ready to blow things up. Which he does, but to a lesser degree than his other '80s potboilers.On the whole, 'Assassination' is late Cannon slop work and doesn't really know what kind of film it wants to be. Besides drifting from actioner to romantic thriller and back again, there are serious mistakes in continuity, property values are bottom-of-the-barrel cheap, and the effects are dreadful; many of the explosions seem like matte work rather than being done on location. Robert Ragland, who had shown good composing skills in earlier films, teamed up with Valentine McCallum on a score that is mostly synthesized and better fit for television.Richard Sale's script has real lulus of dialogue, with the conversations between Bronson and Ireland the only bright spot. There is no explanation as to why the First Lady is called 'One Momma' all of a sudden, nor as to why Ireland is left with her British accent when the character is a Wyoming native. Jan Gan Boyd, playing Killian's main assistant, has a kitten-like personality and is badly miscast as a federal agent. Stephen Elliott (a former Tony Award nominee who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (as assassin Bracken), and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles.Incidentally, this was the last film directing gig for Peter Hunt, who broke onto the scene with 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' in 1969 and collaborated with Bronson and Lee Marvin on 'Death Hunt' in 1981. 'Assassination' is available on DVD through MGM Home Entertainment; it is presented in dual widescreen and standard format with three-language subtitles and theatrical trailer.** out of 4 "},{"Title":"Terrific movie with Jill Ireland and Charles Bronson","Date":"9 September 2003","Score":"12 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I loved this Movie out of all Charles Bronson did.

Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He did two films for one-time Bond director Peter Hunt too - the first being the decent 1981 actioner Death Hunt, the second being this indifferent political chase thriller. Assassination is pretty dull if truth be known, and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace, like The Wilby Conspiracy for instance (which, plotwise, this film resembles). Bronson sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard Jay Killian, whose assignment is to protect the American President's wife, Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, real-life wife of Bronson). Killian believes that Mrs Craig has been targetted by assassins; she thinks he's an over-protective, paranoid pessimist. Turns out - surprise, surprise - that Killian was right all along and someone is indeed out to eradicate her. The pair of them go on the run, pursued by the assassins. Everyone knows that the wife of an American President is known as The First Lady. For some reason, in this film they have renamed her One Mama! Quite what the point of this is is anybody's guess, but it's indicative of the film's pointlessness as a whole. Most of the film's performances are lazy, and the script takes a heck of a long time to get to where it's going. If I had to label Assassination within a specific genre, I'd say it is supposed to be a thriller. I'd say that with some reservations, however, as to say that it's a thriller it has precious few thrills.

He is no longer allowed to guard the President, though. His job is to protect the new First Lady, Lara Royce Craig, who apparently comes from a wealthy family and believes she can do what she wants without listening to anyone.While Mrs. Craig rides to her husband's inauguration in an open car (something no one in the First Family has done since Kennedy was shot), one of the police officers riding alongside has a wreck (and this being a Charles Bronson movie, naturally the bike has to explode). Killian believes it was no accident.Later, Mrs. Craig escapes on several occasions, though the Secret Service is able to find her in each case. Mrs. Craig's behavior is a problem not just because she needs protection under normal circumstances, but because it seems someone actually wants to kill her.Jill Ireland was deliciously witchy (actually that should start with a b) as the First Lady. Charles Bronson's character showed intelligence, and he wouldn't back down but remained strong in the face of the First Lady's protests.It was a pleasure to see the man who played the uptight and dignified Cloud Dancing in Dr. Quinn as an almost stereotypical Native American, a car salesman willing to laugh at people's expectations of his people and go along for the money.Jan Gan Boyd, as Killian's partner (in more ways than one?) was pretty and perky but showed confidence in her facial expressions. Too bad she often seemed to be reading her lines.The violence wasn't constant, but this movie had plenty of gunfire toward the end, and quite a few unnecessary explosions. One exciting scene involved a railroad bridge.The scenery in Wyoming was beautiful.I don't think this was intended to be a comedy, but it certainly was in my opinion. I found it quite entertaining. The idea is to have no real expectations.

Not really an excessive actioner for Bronson considering previous efforts from his career, meaning that it's a little light on the violence factor. Jill Ireland plays the first lady, who has quite a mean streak to her in the film, her snobby attitude makes quite a pairing for her and Bronson's character.

It was a good piece, but it wasn't the non-stop action pack feature that I remembered. A bad thing&#x85; not really. Typical Bronson venture done through Cannon productions? Yes and no. However it's a typical story (even though quite ludicrous at times), but it felt rather low-scale (think of Bronson's 'Messenger of Death' the following year) with its thriller elements and explosively sparse action. Surprisingly when the action did kick into gear, the stunt work and positioning was impressive, but where the film's drive came from was the budding rapport between Charles Bronson (whose appealingly laid-back) and Jill Ireland (diving right into the role with convincing aplomb). Outside of those two I found the rest of the performances sub-standard.The plot is a tautly twisty (but far-fetched) cross-country political thriller that has veteran Secret Agent Jay Killian assigned to protect the demandingly stuck-up first lady, where he uncovers a devious plot involving assassins out to her kill her. It's a complex web, but the material seems to breeze through rather concentrating on the combination of the two main characters and their growing respect for each other. It can be dramatically soapy, but never does it feel as if it's really taking itself seriously due to some forced humour coming from the script. This doesn't stall it at all. Director Peter Hunt (who also directed Bronson with Lee Marvin in the 1981 rugged survival thriller 'Death Hunt') does a conventionally efficient job, even with some sequences coming across as if made for a TV show. When it came to the vigorously pumped-up activity, Hunt was at the top his game accommodating a no-bull approach and the productively scope-like cinematography passes through the top-notch scenic locations with verve-like ease.Earnestly slick filler.

Charles ignores direct orders, because somebody is trying to kill the first lady. What follows is a web of lies and corruption that Charlie must uncover to keep the first lady safeThis is widely regarded as one of Bronson's worst films. I'm actually inclined to disagree vehemently with that opinion. This movie is far from good, but as far as a cheesy action film from Cannon productions goes, it was actually fairly fun, in a dumb sort of way. It has illogical plot twists, despite proper explanation in them, but it does have some nifty action sequences, with some plenty of cheap explosions as well. Charles Bronson is fun as per usual, but his character is a bit of a womanizer. He doesn't actually cheat, but he flirts heavily throughout the film. For his age at the time, Bronson is still very adept at the action, and doesn't look out of place at all. Jill Ireland (Bronson's real life wife at this juncture) is quite imbecilic and annoying as the first lady for much of the first half, before lightening up in the second half. Jan Gan Boyd is rather sexy, and good in her role. I have no idea where she is these daysFinal Thoughts It's cheesy fun, and not rocket science.

Most of the film has Ireland's Mrs. Craig and Killion moving cross country on a road trip as hit-man, Eddie Bracken(Erik Stern)and his gunmen follow in pursuit. Michael Ansara has a supporting part as Senator Hector Bunsen, the one responsible for the terrorist chasing after Mrs. Craig. Jan Gan Boyd is Killion's much younger lover and member of his Secret Agent team. The film benefits from the sparks that often ignite between feisty, acid-tongued Ireland and the more subdued and laid back Bronson, somehow bonding while on the lam despite the obvious tension. A secret revealed by The First Lady about her President husband, regarding his impotence and her reason for marrying him is rather amusing, as is the underlying purpose behind her assassination. Not as gratuitously violent or repellent as other movies starring Bronson during this decade.

And I don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio Cannon and hack director J. Lee Thompson for most of his latter films.Assasination gave me some hopes when I saw that Peter Hunt was directing instead of Thompson but those hopes were quickly dashed. First off, the film looks incredibly cheap, like it was made for about 3 mil, minus Bronson's inflated salary (I heard he insisted on 5 mil per picture which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his Cannon films). The White House scenes were filmed on the VA grounds in West LA - I was taking the bus when they were shooting. Nice job on recreating the white house but did no one think about getting the Palm trees out of the shots? Guess not.Secondly, the supporting cast is really bad. Ireland was dying of cancer and despite this she's not bad but the horrible Asian woman playing Bronson's sidekick was typical of Cannon's talent at the time --non-existent. I would be real curious to learn how she got this role. I can't imagine a worse actress for the part, plus she's a good 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not that bad and it's something that bigger and better-budgeted studios did later (Eastwood's In the Line of Fire and Costner's Bodyguard film) but the way it's staged here is really sad. I'm wondering if they could not afford to do more than one or two takes per shot. None of it is believable in the slightest.

Also, we know what Washington, DC, is like weather wise in January, and not only is everybody top coat less, you can even see some palm trees in the 70 degree and sunny weather! (Obviously filmed in Hollywood, not Washington, DC). This movie is a joke. It is not worth your time.  "},{"Title":"So Bad It's Almost Watchable","Date":"23 January 2010","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Assassination (1987) ** (out of 4) Charles Bronson fans are the only ones who should even attempt to make it through this outrageously stupid film from Cannon. Bronson plays a Secret Service agent who ends up having to guard an ultra-snotty First Lady (Jill Ireland) and soon enough a group of hit men are after her. I'll never accuse any Cannon/Bronson movie of being high art but of all the films they made together this one here has to be the dumbest. In fact, I might go even further and call this the dumbest action movie of the decade and that reason alone almost makes this turkey worth sitting through. As a Bronson fan I must admit that I can just about sit through anything that he's in but my patience are really tested here but thankfully the film reaches a so bad it's entertaining level. There are about fifteen major illogical points that could be thrown at this film but that would take way too much effort to write out and I'm sure most people could write a book worth of dumb things that the characters do here. I must admit it's rather funny seeing a Secret Service agent and the First Lady jump from one cheap motel to another and going from one small town to the next and it never really being clear why they don't just have more security with them. There are countless times you'll be scratching your head as to why the agent just keeps the First Lady in constant danger but I doubt the screenwriters were really worried about logical points as their main concern was getting to the next item to blow up. The action scenes here are pretty weak and campy as is the PG-rated violence. I've heard this wasn't originally meant for Bronson but he took it just so he could be in another film with his wife (this would be their last together). The two are charming enough together even though it's pretty clear neither are giving it their all. The supporting players don't fair much better but I doubt anyone will be tuning in to see them. If you're not a fan of Bronson then it's best you stay far away from this unless you just like corny action pictures. "}]
