The true story - of a Polish baker in Pittsburgh who raised his orphaned grandson at the age of 70+ and put him through medical school - sounds like a formula for sentimentality and cliches. However, the movie transcends that to become a moving story of the strength of family, with many wonderful touches of humor. Peter Falk's portrayal of the irascible, curmudgeonly, and indomitable Rocky Holzcek dominates the movie. We are made to care about all the people portrayed. I don't understand the criticism about the movie not having a story to tie it together. The changing relationship of Rocky and his family as the years go by has plenty of elements of drama. This movie touched me deeply. It's a real sleeper.

The two men love each other deep down, but clash often. Outside of their relationship other stuff happens. The grandson becomes a heart surgeon and has a family of his own while the grandfather meets various new friends and finds employment in a bakery at an old age, until illness forces him to retire. The roles of the two reverse and the grandson now finds himself caring for the grandfather who once cared for him when he was an orphaned boy. Definitely check this movie out and read the book but be warned it's a tear jerker that will tug at your heart strings.

Peter Faulk performs splendidly. Although slow in a few parts, the storyline more than makes up for it as it shows the trials and tribulations of family separated and joined together by generational gaps. Julian Moore give a great performance and looks absolutely beautiful in this film, even though her character is not as in depth as the main characters. And DB Sweeny shows that he can have a softer side, as well as a wise cracking smooth talking side. It was a little bit of a stretch from what he is normally known for doing, but he pulled it off very well. Roommates is definitely going into my collection. I give this one 8/10. Bravo guys.

Not that I have anything against Columbo -- it's one of the all-time great cop characters, along with Sgt. Friday and Sipowicz -- but in a police procedural we're mainly interested in what happens next, and any good director keeps that in mind. Here Falk gets to display the breadth and depth of his powers, and keeps us enthralled from the first scene to the last. He was only 68 when this film was released, but is convincingly aged during its course from something like 60 up to 107 (yes, really), which is a tribute not only to him but to the formidable makeup department (IMDb lists nine makeup credits). And just because grandfather is such an overpowering character, we shouldn't ignore the fine performances by D.B. Sweeney as his physician-grandson and Julianne Moore as the young social worker. In all, this is a moving story, well made and superbly acted. If you haven't seen it, do.

Women may see Bette Midler in Beaches comforting her friends or Susan Sarandon in Thelma and Louise shooting up the Southwest.  On the other hand men have the Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop series where dim witted detectives team up with fast thinking/street smart partners. The formulas are typical and boring. This movie sets the stage for a different type of buddy movie. The premise is set right away with Michael Holzcek being orphaned(mother died previously with an illness) when his father dies in Vietnam and no one will raise him except his grandfather Rocky played by Peter Falk who becomes his lifelong buddy/mentor.  Rocky is a Polish American in Pittsburg and at the time well past 65 but still working hard as a baker while his contemporaries are retired or dead.  He is told that he is too old to raise a kid but whoa this senior is on a mission and not done yet! Rocky has his own stubborn ways and the my way or the highway philosophy of life. The story unfolds with Rocky teaching Michael the values of family and life. Unfortunately, Michael picks up alot of Rocky's say it like it is habits. Along the way, Michael sets out to get his college degree and head off to medical school eventually interning in Columbus, Ohio.  Of course, Rocky has to join him in a home shared with Chinese medical students.  This part of the movie lends itself to many funny episodes with Rocky trying to fit in with the students. Michael's life seems to be in a rut-just work and of course no sleep because Rocky is a horrific snorer. Life stinks until he meets his future wife to be Beth. However, no one is good enough for Michael according to Rocky but eventually Rocky learns to live and let live and accept Beth. The marriage develops a number of new situations and it is Beth that teaches Michael the true key to becoming a good doctor,humanity and compassion. I really enjoyed the movie but it was Peter Falk that made the movie. He has an extensive movie history and although known for the extremely successful Columbo TV series,he has received many awards and got his first real recognition for the true life based movie Murder Inc.Roomates has a good story line but there are several goofs that prevent it from getting a top rating. Here are my observations.Although it is an ethnic movie and he was Polish American, there was no hints of Polish culture like food, dance etc.  It was like the story was a composite of traits of many ethnic groups and the writers just chose Polish American as a label. D.B. Sweeney was not a  good choice as Michael, his boyish looks are hard to make him look older as the years advance in the movie. He is also ethnic looking alright-like right out of an Irish movie with his reddish hair. However, a real big booboo was when Rocky was doing the laundry at Michael's house,(at this point Michael was married with children and had completed his doctor residency of 8 years)and had to have been 35.  Rocky at that point would have been 98 or 100.  He was moving around quicker than most 25 year old guys in a boxing match. Also he was a baker all of his life-a grueling, on your feet, all day occupation yet no physical ailments or complaints in the storyline. Falk also had a plastic cap over his head to make him look bald and old but it looked so bad that it reminded you of a game show host from the 70's with a lousy hairpiece(rug). I recommend this movie and had some of the details been attended to, it would have been outstanding. Perhaps this is the reason that this entertaining film was probably not released in theaters.

A Loving Relationship.","Date":"25 July 2003","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS        Our story begins in Pittsburgh, 1963. Five year old Michael Holzcek went to live with his grandfather Rocky. After all, he had lost his father in Vietnam and his mother died of an illness. Rocky was a feisty fifty year old, but loved his grandson. They went to baseball games together and Rocky taught Michael that fighting isn't always a good idea--right after he beat up a bully for stealing Michael's baseball. At night, Rocky's snoring kept Michael awake; Rocky worked as a baker. He was the finest in town; Ten years later, Michael, now 15 and in a private school, was caught fighting with another boy; Rocky wanted Michael to become a baker like he, but Michael really wanted to be a doctor. And his dream was about to come true, for ten years later in 1983, Columbus, Ohio, Michael was an M.D. and he was administering to a feisty old lady patient, Cecilia. She had no family, but was brought in by a social worker, Beth. Before Michael and Beth could become more acquainted, Michael was called away to Pittsburgh for Rocky had been evicted from his apartment but refused to leave. After much convincing, Rocky agreed to leave and live with Michael, as he had offered.         Michael lived in a townhouse with five Asian people, whom Rocky called Communists. Michael's apartment only had one bedroom which Michael wanted Rocky to take, but Rocky wanted to bet it in a game of gin--which took all night. Rocky, although in his early eighties, got a job at a bakery in a super market. He disliked it because it was an organic bakery so he couldn't use flour or sugar; Michael and Beth start to work up a beautiful relationship. Michael meets her mother, Judith, and Beth meets Rocky, who was incredibly rude to her. She got upset. Michael was forlorn. But soon they worked it out; Michael got an offer to attend a university to become a surgeon and he desparately wanted to go, but he didn't want to leave Beth or Rocky, but Rocky was okay with him going because he had worked up quite a relationship with the Communists. So Michael went, but before so, he popped the question to Beth and they were married. Two years later- Rocky appears on a TV show and speaks ill of Michael. Speaking of ill, Rocky suddenly fell ill while bowling with the Communists. He was taken to a hospital where he was diagnosed with cancer, which was unnerving to him by the mere mention of it because that's what killed his wife. But, Rocky's tumor was benign so he went on living happily.          In Pittsburgh, 1993- Michael, Beth, their two kids and Rocky lived happily. Michael was about to perform his first open heart surgery. Their daughter Lisa was ill so Beth ran out to get medicine when she swerved to miss a car and was hit by another. Sadly, she did not survive. Michael was deeply depressed. Nothing else mattered to him now. Not even his own children! He neglected them greatly, so they spent time with Rocky. Judith threatened to sue for custody of the kids and Michael didn't seem to want to stop her. But Rocky had a plan. At Mo's birthday party, Rocky slipped ice cream down Judith's gas tank so when she tried to take the kids away, she didn't get far. Soon after, Rocky convinced Michael to cheer up. So he did. After that, things were great. But soon, Rocky, who was now 107 years-old, was deeply ill. Michael went to see him in the hospital where they share their true feelings for one another, then Rocky laid back, closed his eyes, and was gone.        This movie was OKAY. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Peter Falk was good and his make-up looks great, but unfortunately you can see his bald cap line in many scenes. D.B. Sweeney was good too. So was Julianne Moore, as sexy as ever. This movie kind of relates to the movie Dad with Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson. Mostly because of the scene where Rocky is diagnosed with cancer. Jack Lemmon's character got cancer in Dad, but Rocky survived it here. Lemmon did not. In real life too. Tragic. So if you're in the mood for a good comedy-drama, I recommend Roommates. It makes you realize how valuable and special the old people in your life really are.- "},{"Title":"Absorbing but s l o w.

I somewhat disagree with the above users outlook on Julian Moore. In comparison to other films, I found her performance to be somewhat lacking.I did however believe that the storyline was quite interesting. I have watched this movie and find it analogous to my roommates online network experience. I mean, did you know that there were places to find people like this. Not to knock these services and believe me, I had a genuinely good experience at www.roommatesonline.net. But I did notice that other places where you could find this type of roommate were lacking in selectivity.They always say that you can pick and choose your friends/acquaintances, but getting a roommate is often just the same as in this move - you can't quite pick them. And although you might not like them, it seems that the interesting ones keep coming back. I give this movie a 7/10 for effort and a decent storyline.

I like a lot of Peter Falk's work. I truly LOVE Columbo. It was a great show that is still watchable due to the acting of Falk & the stories. I think the reason I love this film so much is that the character of Rocky somehow reminds me of my own father (who is old enough to be my grandfather) Like Rocky, my father is gruff, stubborn, snores incessantly, & loves his family albeit rarely says it. He shows his love with his actions not his words. Now that I have a son of my own & have my father living with me I hope that one day my son will be able to appreciate this film as I do.

That, like this movie, was a comedy/drama. But the real difference between the two is how the earlier production struck a believable, painfully human balance, and Roommates just barely achieves status quo. It's also somewhat uneven. Early on, it sets out to be a light comedy, with a bit of drama to ground it. This basic tone never shifts, but with the entire third act being so miserable, it's prevented from being convincing. There's no point where it's especially unlikable, just frustrating.The acting has something to offer, even though I've seen nearly everyone give better performances. Julianne Moore, Ellen Burstyn, Peter Falk - three of my favorites - aren't really offered enough to show their respective talents. Falk, even though he's the star of Roommates, seems like an afterthought, a minor character who steps in to offer periodical clever quips. And I didn't find the makeup work to be particularly convincing.An overall problem comes down to the script. Although the film seems long enough, even too long at times, it feels truncated in order to fit in all the chronology. There are breaks of years, seven or five, or however many, and people don't seem to change or age normally. It's like watching a stage play when you know there's been no passage of time, and can't be properly convinced otherwise. Roommates is a film that doesn't really know what it is or what it wants to be. The VHS cover shows a scene from the film involving a garden hose. In the photograph, it looks playful. It the actual movie, it is part of a serious argument. That just about sums up the dichotomy that is Roommates.

And what we have here is a lesson in  precision.This could only have been written by someone who teaches writing for a living; it relies  on so many tricks of the popular pen that like Waller (`Bridges of Madison County') and  Sparks (`Message in a Bottle') that you feel dirty and guilty afterward for having actually  enjoyed that hot dog.Grandpa here is not the main character, instead the center is a big hole left by people  who have died first Dad, then Mom, then Wife. Swirling around that hole are vignettes  whose only purpose is to sharpen the focus on its emptiness.The thing that works here is the amazing Julianne Moore, who enters and carries herself  in a manner calculated to exit memorably. The previous year she reinvented layered  acting with `Vanya' and then dove into five films in a year. These five are all over the  place, each one a perfect sonnet of acting; all are trivial projects. All are raised by what  she does.The only string this film doesn't pull is the dog.
