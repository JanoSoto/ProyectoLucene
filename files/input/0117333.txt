In my opinion, John Travolta deserved at least a nomination for an Oscar here, if not the award itself. The story was decent, but the performances of Travolta, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall, and Kyra Sedgwick made me care about what was happening on the screen. By no means is this a romantic comedy. It's romantic, probably the most romantic film I have seen in a long time. The reason for that is simple...it's real. In most movies you see the main characters sleep together within a day at the most, which rarely happens with two people who are really in love. True love has to take time and effort, which is exactly what you see here. Travolta's George is patient, but not because he wants to be. If you're a romantic at heart you will understand and relate to him, and you will hope for his success as you would for your own. Without giving anything away, I will tell you that the ending is sad, but also heartwarming. George has his experience for no other reason than to suggest what we as humans can become. Phenomenon is a story about our potential, the good and bad things that can happen to us if we achieve it. We could only be so lucky, and watching the movie is a good start. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.

Slyly funny and innovative at first and then impressively dramatic and thought-provoking, Phenomenon is an effective picture that comes through because of good performances across the board and smart screen-writing. Travolta and Duvall are excellent together and they share the spotlight in the venture. Under-rated production that should be given a try.

In some ways, this film reminds me of another seeming science fiction movie that really turned out to be about people's response to the unusual `Charly'   In both films an extraordinary increase in intelligence frightened the people around the main character; they just couldn't deal with it and feared him for it. The love story was a gem.  Lacy had obviously been badly hurt by a past relationship, and simply didn't want to encourage George's love.  But when he began to be hurt by the way some of his friends treated him, she warmed and opened her heart to him. The way George tried to describe how he looked at things differently and saw relationships that he'd never seen before reminded me of classical descriptions of the act of creativity in many fields.  And it's a sad thing but true that we are all capable of concentrating harder and focusing on things to achieve more, but it's very difficult, and more often than not, we tend to take the easier road.

It's a very subtle and philosophical film that expresses more than meets your senses. It goes right for your heart and stays there. One might argue that it is a very sugarsweet tale of the things that make life (worthwhile), but there is so much more to it. The heart of the matter is that nothing goes to waste in the universe. Everything is on it's way to somewhere all the time. Energy will manifest itself without getting tired. Things, bodies, thoughts, even love, are all vessels that are secondary to the spirit that drives them. This sounds all very vague and maybe even religious-like. But indeed some things are hard to explain. Questions are often a waste of time. So don't ask where all this energy originates from. Phenomenon will not provide the answer, at least it is not pretentious in that direction because the makers realize that the human-mind is unfit to grasp this in the first place. Phenomenology is the philosophical school that investigates how things appear in the world. The film shows that it is often slightly or profoundly different from how it looks at first hand. I enjoyed the simple way of presenting this very complicated message that matters to all of us and everything else too.

I attribute its existence to the film Powder, which came out a few years ago, and I am honestly looking forward to more innovative dramas in a similar vein.It will probably not become a classic, but it deserves to be seen in its time.  Perhaps the honesty of this film will inspire other, greater filmmakers with more influence to change their ways and provide more thinking elements in their films.Watch it with a loved one on a Saturday night.  A good alternative to show those boyfriends who are  caught up in their own male-ness.  Try this before plopping in Gone with the Wind.  It may bridge the gap.

For those who haven't seen it, John Travolta plays George Malley, the central character, a somewhat slow-witted nice guy who has a strange experience that awakens his consciousness and begins to hyperactivate his mind. In short, he becomes a phenomenon.The movie does a wonderful job of presenting George's struggle as he seeks to understand what is happening to him. His friends, however, are equally befuddled and the unanswered questions that arise from their own insecurities cause misunderstanding, pain and rejection. It's almost as scary to know a phenomenon as to be one.In my opinion it was a good story well told. Like all good stories, it unearthed regions of my own soul, areas I have mined before and will mine again because I believe their are still some precious stones to uncover there.It is a life theme to which I often return. Are we not each a phenomenon in our own way? What is the meaning of my life? What are my unique gifts? Where has my power come from from? And how much of it is unused, undeveloped, unactivated.We use so little of our strength, our psychic powers, our capabilities. We choose, instead, to live in a dark, dull, ill-lit corridor called 'life', a cramped hallway with narrow walls, yellowed, peeling wallpaper, moldy and stifling. Windowless and without wind. No unpredictable weather. And we wonder why it bores us, why we've lost our passion.John Updike made the observation that there are Four Life Forces Love, Habit, Time and Boredom. Love and Habit are powerful, giving short term energy and stability to our lives. Time has a more long term grinding influence. But Boredom, the great leveler, is a prison that captures us subtly. When boredom becomes a habit, life passes us by.In this film, George Malley sees the wonder of this passing phenomenon we call life. His becomes obsessed with embracing it... before it does indeed escape him.Nice supporting cast, especially Ms. Sedgewick and Forrest Whittaker.

This movie has definitely made me a BIG Travolta fan. I enjoyed Blow Out, but didn't realize it was one of a chain of movies that Travolta was making. Now that I am aware of his range of acting-abilities - everything I've seen, so far, is so easily projected - I'll be on the look-out for all of his films.Many other users have detailed the story this movie tells - thank heavens it has one ! George was simply George - when incidents happen to us that change our personna, other people also change the way they think of us. I'd feel the same way if one of my buddies started acting differently, and showed much more intelligence than I knew he possessed. Kyra Sedgewick (Lace Pennamin) was unknown to me, so I had no way to judge her performance, but certainly enjoyed it. Again, simplicity, not a lot of unneeded drama. Forest Whitaker (Nate Pope) was stellar in his portrayal of the few friends who could tell something unusual was happening to his buddy, as was Robert Duvall's (Doc) portrayal. The entire cast was great - but, Travolta's simple deliverence of undramatic lines (and his brilliant smile and open face) make this movie the great entertainment, and uplifting message, it is.Director Turtletaub got it all together to put scriptor Gerald DiPego's story on the screen. It is apparent that all who played in the movie enjoyed their work - all of us should have no reason not enjoy their efforts.

John Travolta (as George) delivers a disarmingly charming performance, and Robert Duvall (as Doc) displays a warmth and affection for his friend George. Forrest Whitaker (as Nate) is masterfully understated as the faithful friend who is the recipient of George's manipulation (the translation scene) and Kyra Sedgewick (as Lace) is the love of George's life. The inquisition scene with Brent Spiner was funny without being trite or serious---you feel George's frustration as he is treated like a lab rat.

George Malley is one of them. But on the night of his birthday, something unexpected happens which completely alters his life. A bright light in the sky - that is what he sees that night. From the next day onwards, everything seems different. Or rather clearer one might say. Scientifically, its all about more clarity. But to a common man, it seems much more. The movie then is about how George changes and how the folks around him react to it.The earliest signs observed are checkmating the doc in a game of chess(whom he has never beaten before), unable to sleep in the night and growing restlessness with the amount of time available. With seemingly more clarity, his mind starts taking the scientific bend to things. He is able to crack intelligent militant codes, generate power out of organic material and in one such scenario, predict an earthquake by sensing the vibrations. This leads to getting acquainted with Prof. John Ringold who witnesses many more marvels by George including learning Portuguese in 20 min(not all though). However, many impedances present themselves to George from FBI intending to stop him perceiving him as a compromise to national security to reactions from common people who barely understand him.However, there are three people who stand by him during all this. The good old doc, a faithful friend and then the Lady Love. The romance is of waiting painful kind(and by that I mean not one of those easy romances) and there is one especially good scene. Overall, it is well shown.In the end, science takes over with the phenomenon being explained in pure rational terms and an end coming to all of it but not before George passing his semi-completed works to the world.The movie plot is a great idea - and execution even better. The situations - A common man experiencing a miracle, clarity of mind being so easy for the one having it and yet so difficult for others to grasp, becoming unacceptable as one changes, finding true love and dying in peace - all these are explored and shown beautifully.Finally John Travolta as George Malley is wonderful. The journey he undergoes is expressed wonderfully and is well supported by other characters. All in all, a very good film to watch.

Living day in and out and living through the chores of life, we, more often than not, think that this is all we can do as humans; but only if we believe in ourselves, and trust the strength and determination of the human spirit, can we gauge the list of endless possibilities that we are capable of. This movie precisely tries to show us that, to be open and to be respectful, through the humble life of George. His dialog towards the end of the movie with the doctor is priceless - that talks the value of human life, our expressing power, and our hope to a better future. I'm a science student and the more I discover things, answer the whys, i realize we just know the tip of the iceberg. In front of us lies the vast ocean of mystery, for us to discover someday.

Don't miss one of the most best shaving scenes in recent memory. Keep this one on your shelf of DVD's and see it with your significant other. It's a keeper for sure.

His mind is opened up, his powers are opened up, but basically, his heart was always open. Perhaps this is why this movie is so powerful - it shows us what is possible, even without amazing powers - if only our hearts are open.Not just a chick-flick... guys will enjoy it too, and there are some very sexy scenes. (Unoffensive to kids, though.)This is a creative, clever movie, with an important message, and a great soundtrack! (I bought the CD, and I never buy movie CDs!)I'm sorry more people didn't see it.

People in the town start to make fun of him and treat him bad, but when something bad happens they come to him to help and he does. With his new found powers he starts to solve his every day problems and of others around him. He starts to devour books increasing his knowledge and starts to turn him into almost a circus side show, also ends up cracking some government codes and ends up being arrested and held in a secret location and thinking he is some kind of spy.

This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them.I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene.What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

Whatever be the genre, Phenomenon was touching & soulful.The lights that John Travolta's character experiences one night is open to interpretation and I prefer it that way. The mystery makes the movie all the more engaging & impressive to me.John Travolta(as George Malley) has given a heartfelt performance, many say, the best of his career. He was at ease in his role, being vulnerable, funny, intelligent, frustrated or even in love. The other actors who touch our hearts too are Robert Duvall(as Dr. Brunder), Forest Whitaker(as George's pal) and even the pretty Kyra Sedgwick(as John's crush, Lace) impresses.What I especially like about the movie is how the story still focuses more on the relationship between the character George and the others in the community after his life-changing experience one night that suddenly turns him into a gifted intellect. Otherwise, Phenomenon could have been just like any other superhero flick about Travolta saving the world with his bare hands or brain! The ending(final scene between George & Lace), I wish, could have been more effective. It came to an end a bit abruptly to me.Verdict Adorable & romantic. What starts off like a scifi ends being a tale of genuine friendship, care and love.

There is the small town setting where everyone knows everyone. They did a great job casting and you truly believe these people have known each other their whole lives.There are some memorable scenes here - one of my favorites being when she cuts his hair and shaves his face in his kitchen. Its a very romantic and sensual scene without having to be explicit. They don't even kiss. Its just the nearness of each other and how tender she is with him. Very sweet moment. You can see her defenses start to melt and let herself feel something for him. It was filmed beautifully with nice close-ups.I also like the scene where he is working frantically in the garden and suddenly stops and starts listening to and watching the wind in the trees. Then he starts swaying in tune with the trees. I think this is one of Travolta's best performances as he helps us get to know and understand George Malley. His interpretation of the character is crystal clear and brilliantly done. He has an underlying sweetness and enthusiasm that works well for this character. I liked Sedgewick okay - but I think Travolta outshines her here. Duvall also does a great job as Doc.There are a lot of good messages here about living our life to the fullest and reaching our potential. I liked the analogy of buying her chairs and how to find out what your love is into. The film is about change, acceptance and love. And that people don't like the unexpected but would prefer to live the same predictable lives.

He desperately wants single Mum (Sedgwick) who has two adorable kids, to notice him, vying for attention. Things heat up, when his new found knowledge of stuff, lands him in some water with the government as cracking one of their codes. The actor I loved in this film though, was The Hitcher's Jeffrey De Munn, as a scientist, who's after the supposed UFO sighting (light beam that hit Travolta). The third act, I warn you, is quite a heartbreaking and emotion filled one, with Travolta learning of his quick dying fate. The acting here between him and Sedgwick is so good, especially Sedgwick. This is not the norm of thet characters, Travolta plays, It's a more softer role, and he does it well. Duvall must be commended too, really good as the town doctor, and close friend of Travolta's.

Kyra Sedgwick plays the love interest who manufactures chairs and will need to deal with her feelings towards George and his destiny. Robert Duvall steals scenes as his doctor, as does Forest Whitaker as his best friend despite formula moments.

Let's see. The general idea is lifted from Field of Dreams, only this is episodic instead of linear and lacks the happy climactic bonding of son and deceased father. I mean, each of the protagonists has a weird experience alone in a farming community, after which he becomes obsessed and hypomanic, and the local Sons of the Soil regard him as nuts. Then, in the odd ball villagers, there is a touch of Northern Exposure and Rocket Gibraltar, the film to which the television series owes a good deal. The structure runs parallel to Charlie. I think maybe the jumbo but pathetic monster of Frankenstein may be stretching things too far.Travolta is convincing enough as the cheerful, modest, perceptive brain tumor victim. I liked Kyra Sedgewick because she fits the role of the single mother with two children who wants to keep her life uncomplicated out here in the wilderness of buff hills and bunch grass. Forest Whitaker is fine as the recluse -- the only black guy in town as far as we can tell -- who seems to be Travolta's sole friend in this village. Robert Duvall's part is relatively small but he lends it more energy than he has in any of his other recent films.The FBI, academia, and famous brain surgeons provide the villains. The most famous brain surgeon in the world is Richard Kiley who tries to persuade Travolta to let him operate on his brain while it's still working, though it may not even prolong his life, let alone save it. Travolta could open new doors. Travolta replies to this importuning with You don't get it, do you? You have one hand on technology and one hand on science and you have nothing left for the human spirit. I'm on the side of Richard Kiley. Let them go ahead and peel open my head. The worst (or the best) that could happen is that you expire painlessly while in deep anesthesia. The alternative, which Travolta chooses, is to die at Kyra Sedgewick's farmhouse with its vista of live oaks under blazing blue skies. Yet, death from an astrocytoma is a horrible death. You don't die peacefully. You vomit, act irrationally, lose your wits, wind up immobilized, and suffer excruciating pain. The ending is a fantasy.It struck me as a tale aimed at the heart rather than the head, as Woody Allen once put it. There are pop songs about love and self actualization played over long scenes of smooching and driving around in a beat-up old pick up truck. It was all a bit much.

I grew up with Travolta on Welcome Back Kotter, and I was not impressed. A number of movies went by, and I saw a few...and became cautiously optimistic that maybe he was at least an okay actor. But with a few films right around 1996, including this one, he won me over. No, he's no Laurence Olivier, but he's a very pleasant and often very interesting actor. This may be his best role, although you don't realize it until well into the movie when he begins to have a sort of breakdown, and you see the transformation of the character he plays.The story is a good one...a man she some flashes of light in the sky and suddenly becomes brilliant, learns things remarkably fast, develops complex and original ideas, etc. Of course, the government gets involved, and eventually -- when they realize he will soon die -- they want to do open brain surgery to learn as much as they can. Will they succeed? Meanwhile, throughout the film he is trying to win the heart of Kyra Sedgwick...who's a hold out of sorts...the rest of the town loves him...until his weirdness begins to freak them out.Personally, I'm not a fan of Kyra Sedgwick, and I wouldn't have cast her in this role...although she does okay. Similarly, I wouldn't have chosen Forest Whitaker as the role of best friend. Robert Duvall is another actor I never cared for...but, it has been re-looking at roles like this that have led to me reconsidering the quality of his acting, and I have to admit I was wrong...he was and is a terrific actor, and demonstrates that again here. It was nice to see Richard Kiley as the brain specialist here, not that his character is one you are apt to like.

Both films are about a gifted individual with unusual powers and the reactions of those around him. Phenomenon differs from Powder in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them.The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA).This is an interesting What if? story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character.I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? Another example comes to mind, albeit different when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it.

How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.It goes without saying that Phenomenon is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought.Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a realistic ending.

At first, he realizes what he can do, but he doesn't lust for power, or any of those clichéd things. As his power and ability increase, he remains a nice guy. He tries to help people, despite that some resent him, even to the point of speed-learning a foreign language in minutes. He even develops a gentle romantic interest. And then ...Major Spoiler He finds out that the source of his advancement is actually the result of a cerebral malignancy, so he ends up dying. This is where I get so angry with the lack of imagination of Hollywood scriptwriters that figurative steam comes out of my ears. These unimaginative hacks are so uninspired that they don't know what to do with a sympathetic superhuman not in a comic-book superhero film. When one doesn't know what to do with such a character, the coward's way out is to kill him off. It was done in the film, Powder, too (though that film was not as cohesive as this one). With George's powers, if he concentrated on it, he had the potential to cure himself. But killing off is such a lazy solution that a child could have come up with it (and for all I know, one did). The film could have had a more intellectually honest ending, but the writers failed the test. A pity.

The light causes him to fall backwards. He thinks it is strange, but when he tells everyone else they think it's nothing. Over the course of the next few days, car mechanic Geroge Malley becomes increasingly intelligent and can even move things just by thinking about them. He can speed read and thinks of great plans that would be of use in his community. However, word gets out about this strange phenomenon and he is known as 'freak' by some, 'liar' by others. George also tries to get with Lace Pennamin, a pretty women who always seems to ignore him because of the heartbreak she dealt with when she was with her husband who left her. Lace has two children who immediately adore George. This movie is unique and highly entertaining and you may enjoy it, whether you like romance, dramas or even a bit of sci-fi.

Also, beware of spoilers here in this review!First of all, I'm a big Frank Capra fan, so I'm sentimental. I love feel good movies more than anything. This movie feels like one of those old time movies Mr. Capra would have made.I don't need to give the plot since anyone can discover that. I would just like to mention some of my favorite scenes from the movie that make it a classic in my book! I own the DVD now!What I love most about this movie is the music! Thomas Newman is my favorite composer and he did a masterful job with this movie! I didn't know who he was when I heard this soundtrack and many others. It was a fluke not that long ago that I realized that he was the one who has done by far most of my favorite soundtracks! It was shocking to see how many he did! From Six Feet Under, to The Shawshank Redemption to many more! The best music of all is the first track at the beginning of the movie, which plays throughout the movie everytime John Travolta becomes mesmerized by the trees swaying in the wind. It's been over 7 years since I first saw this movie and I have never forgotten the powerful emotions that these images ignited within me. I still look at trees and nature differently thanks to this much underrated movie! It is one of the best scenes ever in history...in my opinion anyway.*Big SPoiler warning* Another one of my favorite all-time scenes is the scene in the hospital near the end of the movie when John learns his fate. Forest Whitaker, Sedgwick and DuVall have never been better. If you look closely at their performances in the background you will notice true, raw emotion! You can almost feel their pain as they share the tragic news to their friend. Duvall's speech about how he feel in love with George (John's charactor) after taking care of his broken his leg as a kid was wonderful. He ends it with For a man who never had any kids of his own, I feel like I'm losing a son!Then the topper comes when Kyra is alone with John in the hospital room. She tells him that she tried her best not to fall in love with him and he asks her How'd that turn out? and she replies with Terribly! Then he asks her Will you love me for the rest of my life? and she replies with one of the most memorable lines ever in movie history, No...I'm going to love you for the rest of mineAnother amazing and memorable scene comes after that when John shows Kyra how he feels most of the time when he gets lost in bliss while appreciating nature and the dancing trees in the wind. He tells her to imagine holding her newborn baby and rocking it gently when the baby didn't feel well. She closed her eyes and gently rocked the imaginary baby as that hauntingly beautiful song plays.The ending is sad, but so memorable. It's just like real life, really. We will all have sad endings, but what we do while alive and how we are remembered by our loved ones is what matters most. This movie is a blessing.

There's the demonization of psychiatric medicine and the US government. There's the one-dimensional goodness of the hero characters, nice and simple like in L Ron's pulp stories.I'm happy the CoS can't get away with stuff like this as much now, due to greater public awareness of their efforts.

However, how would we feel if we knew or witnessed someone who could seemingly prove it possible. Some of us would be skeptical, even though we might want to believe it were true.

I especially love the scene where Brent Spiner (known mostly for his role as Data in Star Trek The Next Generation) is flabbergasted as he questions George (Travolta) for the government.For those of you who like romance, there's no shortage of that either.

They are both about similar characters that are the victims of intolerance, suspicion, and abuse in one form or another. John Travolta is excellent as George, a garage mechanic that suddenly has an increased appetite for knowledge. Put yourself amidst intellectually inferior people and you will see for yourself how George is treated. People are very quick to accuse, get angry, and be jealous in real life, just as they were in this movie. Robert Duvall and Forest Whitaker lend good support as the only two faithful friends he has. Kyra Sedgwick is your typical small minded (going nowhere) girl you'd find in Anytown, USA. I had a huge problem with her abusive mistreatment of George and George's tolerance of her obnoxiousness. She was a huge turn-off. Somehow her sweetness is drawn out by the new George. The kids are appropriately of the cute TV variety. The ending is marred by a soapy climax and conclusion, and I gather that most people didn't expect it to go in the direction it did. There are some good plot threads and the final scene is poignant; I just wish it could have gotten there in a different manner. **1/2 of 4 stars.

This may sound cynical, but as one who has worked with gifted children, I've seen the name-calling and taunting. When George gets his gift, he becomes like a small child--gathering knowledge--absorbing the implications of his power. He should have read some history, however, because he would have better understood the way he was being treated. At least he wasn't burned at the stake. The circus comes to town and he is the freak--even being granted healing powers--something he has never claimed to have. While very touching it disappoints, becoming even a bit clichéd (we've been down this road with Cliff Robertson's Charly). The writers needed to go deeper into their what if banks and ask themselves more about the implications of George's being.

It's a little like MICHAEL, wherein Travolta plays a looney who may or may not be an angel and then comes to a 100-car chain collision of an ending.

On the night of his birthday, Travolta, an auto mechanic from an idyllic farming community, sees a bright light in the skies; it appears to fire something into him, knocking him off his feet, and by the next minute he has an extraordinarily clear head (nothing is made of the connection between the supernatural occurrence and Travolta's birthday--that's just a ruse to get him outside at night). Soon, he's speaking fluent Spanish, reading three books a day, unscrambling Morse Code, building rocking chairs, and beating doc Duvall at chess! Much of Travolta's progress is done up in happy montages to pop songs (Every day is a winding road...), while John attempts to woo the local single mom (using auto innuendo!) and alienating just about everyone else (alas, they're too 'simple' to understand).

However, I just did not feel any of the emotion that I assumed the film Phenomenon was attempting to convey. I by no means blame this on the actors who, for the most part, put in above average performances based on what they were given. Unfortunately it is difficult to work on a higher level when the source material never delves deeper than surface level emotion. The downfall of this film falls squarely upon the poor, scattered screenplay. Although built on an intriguing concept regarding the power of human thought that occasionally does hit the mark and make an insightful comment on human nature (particularly the psychology of how people react to the unknown), it does not seem to know exactly where it wants to take this idea. Instead, the plot rambles about from one event to the next, which works for the first hour or so&#151;up until we hit the twist. A twist that takes all remaining mystery or intrigue out of the film and pushes it from a somewhat thought-provoking supernatural piece to what I'm sure the writers assumed would be a heart-wrenching drama. Regrettably, with so little emphasis on character development before this point (only the likable, good-guy George ever seems to have consistent motivation throughout the film) it makes it hard to connect with any of the suddenly formed relationships that could have been the basis for the drama of the last portion of the film. As much as I wanted to feel for George and the inevitable ending that had been presented, I found it difficult to muster up much emotion aside from a touch of depression which was brought on more by the unexpected, dreary down-turn of the plot than the event itself.Normally, I enjoy realistic science fiction films and the use of average heroes as protagonists, but due to the many downfalls of the script I found myself merely feeling disappointed as all hope I had in the movie slowly dwindled away. Certainly this is not a terrible film and the actors do their best to keep what little they have to work with afloat, but, for the most part, it is entirely unmemorable and would have done better as a feel-good, Sunday evening flick.

When relatives of mine lived in the US, we flew over to join them for the Christmas and New Year holidays. We had three films on the flight there Broken Arrow (crap), The Rock (better) and The Santa Clause (inexcusable, even for Christmas). On the return flight (which was a night flight), we had one Phenomenon. We would have had more but the power failed in the passenger section of the plane, meaning the flight was silent and the only lights we could see were on the wing. And here's the thing - you could hear a sigh of relief when the screen blacked out, as though the whole plane was thankful that the film had been taken off.Admittedly, it's not that bad but this is a long way from Travolta's best as he plays George, a fairly simple mechanic in a hum-drum farm town in the dusty middle of nowhere. The sort of place you see in Loony Tunes cartoons with Porky Pig and Foghorn Leghorn. Anyway, after drinking a few at his birthday party, George is hit by a strange light and begins to develop super intelligence and other, more mysterious powers. Can he win the heart of wide-mouthed love interest Lace Pennamin (Kyra Sedgwick) and can he prove his claims to an increasingly hostile public? To be honest, I'm having to work a bit there to explain the plot because, in truth, not much really happens. Like I said, this is small-town America where nothing EVER happens and while it could be argued that George's abilities enrich the lives of those around him and this is his heart-warming story, I'm not buying it for a minute. The only phenomenon I saw was how long this film felt, both on the plane and again on TV when I gave it a second chance. I've no doubt that some viewers will enjoy this emotional drama (I would put money on the fact that my Mum would cry at the ending) but I'm not really one for these sort of films and I was left feeling nonchalant and upset at wasting my time. To be honest, I needed the sleep but you know how it is to watch a film and then miss the ending, no matter how bad the film.Acting is passable from the big names, Robert Duvall (as the town's medic, originally called Doc by every single person in existence!) and Travolta do OK with what they've been given. Forest Whitaker rambles on like a blithering idiot as George's best mate, Nate but for most of the film, I couldn't take my eyes off Kyra Sedgwick's mouth. It's wide enough to swallow three lanes of traffic! Not her fault, bless her, but she does the role with plenty of whimsy. Add to the mix a strong sugary taste and lots of pleasant small-town locales and Phenomeon feels less like the sci-fi it should be and more like Hope Floats with telekinesis.
