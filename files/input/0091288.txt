No less a major force than Orson Welles described Pagnol's own movie 'La Femme du Boulanger' (The Baker's Wife) as the greatest movie ever made.  For someone with a limited canvas - Provence, its small hamlets, the port of Marseilles, and the people who lived there - he sure extracted the maximum mileage.  Jean de Florette and its sequel Manon des Source has now arguably become the highest profile of all Pagnol's work eclipsing even the great trilogy 'Marius', 'Cesar' and 'Fanny' featuring the great Raimu, and his two autobiographical works My Father's Glory and My Mother's Castle.  It is very gratifying for someone with a healthy streak of cynicism in their makeup to read such glowing tributes to this movie.  If French cinema NEEDED an ambassador, which it doesn't, then these two titles - shot back to back as Montand's wife, Simone Signoret, lay dying - could not be bettered.  To add any superlatives to those already posted here would be superfluous so just let me say that Montand is at the top of his game and that is saying something.

I saw this couple of times in the television some years ago and recently bought the DVD just to find out that this film seems to be excellent no matter how often and many times I decide to watch it.Jean de Florette works in so many different levels. I love the breathtaking settings, beautiful French countryside - superterranean paradise. Actors are magnificent, GÃ©rard Depardieu has a long and respected career in the cinema but if you ask me the role of Jean de Florette is truly the very greatest performance of his life. Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil equally shine as the greedy and devious Soubeyrans.Characters are simply incredible. Naturally audience immediately loves the hunchback. He's so warm, nice, sympathetic, unyielding and persistent yet jovial - truly the amiable hero of the story. However, no one can't help of loving those crooked rogues as well. They are so incomprehensibly mean it's definitely comical.That's what makes Jean de Florette such a great and memorable experience. It's a very sad and tragic story but it makes you laugh a lot. In the same time it manages to be extremely cruel, funny and touching. This is exactly what movies are made of. It's safe to call Jean de Florette a perfection, powerful and stirring motion picture experience and a grand classic everyone should watch. 10/10.

Cesar decides to buy the land of his lazy neighbor Martial that has a spring; however, they argue and fight and Cesar accidentally kills him. The nephew Jean Cadoret (Gerard Depardieu) that is a townsman and former fiscal inherits the real estate and moves with his wife Aimee (Elisabeth Depardieu) and his daughter Manon (Ernestine Mazurowna) with intention of living in the farm, cropping and raise rabbits based on readings. Cesar and Ugolin block and seal the spring with cement and Cesar asks Ugolin to get closer to Jean to sabotage his work. Jean, who is called Jean de Florette by the locals, slowly spends all his savings and inheritance and sacrifices his family to get water in a distant spring while the hypocrite Ugolin jeopardizes his efforts pretending to be his friend. Jean de Florette is a heartbreaking epic of greediness and cruelty. I bought this VHS many years ago and only today I have watched this masterpiece of the French cinema (I have no words to tell how much I regret this). The impressive saga of Jean Cadoret a.k.a. Jean de Florette is engaging and supported by a magnificent story and awesome performances, highlighting Daniel Auteuil, Yves Montand and Gerard Depardieu. The characters are very well developed and Daniel Auteuil is impressive in the role of the contradictory character Ugolin. The scene when he tells to his grandfather that he is not crying but his eyes, is fantastic. Jean de Florette somehow recalled me the unforgettable Jean Valjean of The Miserables, and his saga shows how unfair and cruel a human being can be. Tomorrow I will see the sequel Manon des Sources.

This particular story qualifies unquestionably as a good one, on all these points. The viewer is kept in suspense, continuously questioning the outcome of the story, which moves forward from crisis point to crisis point. We can see that a large part of the scriptwriter's role is to ask questions, and then provide the right answers at the right time. These answers can be partial, ambiguous, even contradictory, in order to reinforce the viewer's suspense and questioning.The first question posed in Jean de Florette concerns the success of Ugolin and CÃ©sar in their carnation project. Will they succeed in getting the critical water necessary for the cultivation of these flowers? This question interests us because these two characters have been introduced as somewhat likable, worthy of our support, although, following Pique-Bouffigue's demise, we may have second thoughts about their integrity.A second question rises with the arrival of Jean Cadoret. Will his project of raising rabbits, a project directly in conflict with Ugolin's, succeed? Although we may have considered at first Jean as an intruder who comes and upsets Ugolin's plan, we also realize that the dice are loaded in Ugolin's favor, and our sympathy slowly shifts toward Jean. But we still keep a somewhat favorable image of Ugolin and le Papet, still hoping for positive answers to these first two questions.Pagnol now determines that the progress of the drama toward its conclusion, that is to say the answers to these two questions, will depend on subjective, internal factors, such as the personalities or the stubbornness of the characters, and not on external or providential circumstances.Thus, the new questions now being posed are about the nature of the characters. Can Ugolin carry out his duplicitous game to its conclusion? Will he make a mistake and be discovered, or will he be overcome by a sense of guilt and help Jean by revealing the presence of the spring at les Romarins? The viewer hopes that in the end Ugolin will give in to his positive instincts. As for CÃ©sar, the spectator knows that le Papet, in spite of all the difficulties arising along the way, will never abandon Ugolin's project. Yet the viewer has detected something peculiar concerning CÃ©sar 's reaction when Florette's departure from the village is mentioned. We therefore suspect that somehow Florette's past relationship with CÃ©sar could bring about a positive change in his behavior. Independently, Jean's character will also dominate the outcome of the story. We wonder if his enthusiasm, boundless optimism, and his erudition will somehow contribute to his failure. Jean's scientific approach to his project is itself a sort of revenge against Nature that made him un bossu, - a hunchback, and therefore he will never abandon it.As the film progresses, our attention narrowly focuses on the principal characters and their evolution. We are not distracted by outside events. At the same time, we are torn between the two conflicting wishes for the success of two conflicting projects. This is the originality of Jean de Florette and what distinguishes this story from the usual, vulgar Manichaean novels or films.The themes are the city versus the country, modern versus traditional, and good versus bad.Jean, returning to the country to cultivate the othentic, is an idealist, more or less in the Jean-Jacques Rousseau's tradition. His knowledge has all been acquired in books. He speaks in the idiom of the bureaucrat that he was. He constantly quotes statistics to guide his project and to convince himself and his listeners how Nature should and will behave. He tackles his project with a definitively modern, scientific approach. Nothing is left to chance everything is anticipated and calculated.To the villagers, because of his language, education, and culture, Jean is a kind of pedantic usurper colliding with the peaceful, traditional aspects of their village life. They make fun of Jean because his knowledge was acquired in books, not by experience. These villagers speak with the melodious ProvenÃ§al accent, their conversations peppered with old, colorful sayings and local proverbs. The people of les Bastides are isolated from Jean's world by their hills. They are attached to the land they have worked for centuries, and to their way of life.However, Pagnol, by presenting us with Jean's failure, seems to distance himself from the intellectual tradition, while, at the same time, not considering the country life as a perfect universe, without conflicts. He illustrates the violence that can result from the peasants' deep attachment to their lands. Pagnol exposes us to the tribal mentality of the villagers against foreigners, such as the inhabitants of the nearby village of Crespin. The only outsiders accepted by the villagers are the pillars of a village society the priest, the doctor, and the school teacher, which the village needs in order to exist. Finally, Pagnol shows us the deep motivation of Ugolin and CÃ©sar that is also easily understood by a city-dweller making money.Pagnol's message is thus humanistic in so far as, without ridicule or Manichaeism, he presents the motivations and different points of view of each of his characters. On the same humanistic level, the story demonstrates that not withstanding apparent differences, such as social, regional or physical, all people are alike and deserve to be treated humanely. As such, according to Pagnol, the village life is idyllic, but for the eventual presence of harmful individuals such as Ugolin and CÃ©sar.In spite of Pagnol's naÃ¯ve idealism, the films still succeed, because we are ultimately able to tie up all the loose ends, and to reconcile the warring factions through family and blood ties that transcend any geography.

This is a visually stunning film more like beautiful photographic montage. It is simple, tragic story well told, unlike many of today's plots - implausibly lame, suffering on a CGI crutch for 85 minutes. The simple story is about enduring truths which have been the mainstay of the Greek classics and Shakespeare Our human strengths, our failings, our virtues, and our vices. The story may be a fiction, but its kernel is not. It is stories and story telling like this which has kept our rapt attention for four thousand years.First we should understand that this film is only the first half the novel by Marcel Pagnol which would have been too long as a single film, and out of necessity, was shot as two. The second half is titled, Manon of the Spring. Neither film stands alone as satisfactory because, obviously, it would be incomplete, and naturally, is also important that the two halves be viewed in sequence. For a fairly dispassionate prÃ©cis of the plots, I suggest reading the ones on Wikipedia, so I won't be repetitive here. I also recommend reading the boards for comments and discussions.JdF & MotS were both shot at the same time in 1986 with a budget of $17 million making it/them the biggest budget French films up to that time. JdF grossed $86M worldwide, and of that sum, only $4.9M was from the USA. MotS grossed $56M worldwide, of which only $3.9M was from the USA. In other words, culture films are not a good fit for the American viewing audience, and the gross revenue numbers bear this out. The rest of the world seems to bear out this conclusion.Foreign language films rarely do well in the USA for the simple reason that the vast majority of the viewing audience are unilingual anglophones who do not wish to burden themselves with having to work at understanding their entertainment - they wish to merely consume it. If it requires the work of reading subtitles or thought, it becomes unpalatable. This film requires your attention and thought!But to be fair to the US viewers, the subtitles are at times incomplete or inaccurate, and unlike the spoken word, they do not convey the emphasis or importance of certain bits of dialogue well. The plot is woven steadily throughout the film, so the viewers with no understanding at all of the French language are missing essential dialogue, and therefore plot.The bottom line is this You will either be entranced by these two films and love them, or you will be bored by the first 15 minutes, and you'll translate that into bad film. If your highest quality level of reading is Marvel comics then I suggest you stay away from this one.However, I recall years ago walking into a video store where this was playing on all the monitors.

When translating from one language to a second it is imperative that the translator is a native speaker of the second language. It is soon apparent that that was not the case here. Why oh why did they not devote the care and attention they gave to the original to the foreign language version? Nevertheless cinematography wins through and this is a joy to watch.Firstly, those sub-titles; these include several obscure English words such as genuflect, midden and farrier. Subtitles are literally gone in a flash so they must be sharp, to the point and in everyday language; one does not have time to ponder over them in the cinema, they became an irritant and are off putting. Even when watching a recording at home it is too distracting to have to keep on resorting to a dictionary. Having got that off my chest, let's turn to the film itself.The story is based on a novel L'eau des Collines by Marcel Pagnol, itself an expansion of an earlier novel filmed and directed by Pagnol as Manon des Sources in 1952. Pagnol was a member of the French AcadÃ©mie and achieved fame with his Marseillaise film trilogy CÃ©sar, Marius and Fanny made in the early 30s. After Pagnol's death in 1976 Manon des Sources was remade with the original title at the same time as Jean de Florette(1986) so forming a sequel. The film is set in a small sleepy village, little more than a hamlet, in Provence near the town of Aubagne (Pagnol's birthplace) some dozen or so miles to the east of Marseilles in the 1920s. Much of Pagnol's writing is set in his beloved Provence of which he is a true and passionate observer. The film, made almost 10 years after his death, is the French nation's tribute to him; it presents an idyllic view of life in the sparsely populated rocky hilly region, falling not far short of a masterpiece. One sees all the features of a village run by old men playing pÃ©tanque or just sitting around doing nothing and saying very little. Yves Montand is excellent as CÃ©sar aka Le Papet, one of the village patriarchs. Aged but unmarried he lives with his nephew Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil), a very withdrawn and ugly youth in his twenties with not much to say for himself. They are the sole survivors of the Soubeyran family who once dominated the region. CÃ©sar treats him as the son that was never his. Ugolin finds that the soil around their farm is ideal for growing carnations but as the area is arid they need water for irrigation. They are aware of a long forgotten spring on an adjoining farm, so plot to acquire the land by deception from some townspeople who have recently acquired it. Gerald DÃ©pardieu plays the part of the hunchbacked owner of the land and is the son of a former local beauty Florette who caught many a young man's eye not least that of CÃ©sar. The Soubeyrans are content to bide their time as the years go by, seeming to help their new neighbours become farmers but all the time finding ways of undermining them.The film proceeds at a leisurely pace creating the true atmosphere of this sleepy community and with the breathtaking cinematography coupled with the fine acting it all adds up to a very rare cinematic experience. So much of what CÃ©sar has to say or is thinking is seen in expression on his face; a slight twitch here, a raising of an eyebrow, a nod, they say it all truly a masterly performance reflecting the leisurely way of life. Daniel Auteil also gives a fantastic performance as the seldom-speaking nephew.CÃ©sar is evil and wicked beyond belief and will stoop to anything to get his way, yet he has the most pleasant of disarming smiles and an ever-present twinkle in his eyes. Usually well mannered, his Achilles heel is his temper and when he loses it the consequences are disastrous. Somehow one is drawn to him and sympathises with him. The hunchbacked Jean comes across as the unwanted intruder from the town and one does not feel for him in the way that the story demands. It's all part of the craft of film-making.Quite a few reviewers have praised the background music taken from Verdi's The Force of Destiny. I was so enthralled by the film that I was not aware of any background music until I read these comments, but opera stops for me after Carmen. This exemplary film is in the great tradition of French cinema, which it should be as Marcel Pagnol was himself a great film maker and the founder in 1936 of the journal Les Cahiers du Film. I have given this film only nine marks out of a possible ten on account of the defects I have referred to in the subtitling. One essential quality I expect a film to possess to deserve ten marks is that I must be able to enjoy viewing it time and time again, and Jean de Florette certainly passes that test.

As their dreams are not compatible, Ugolin and Cesar block up the spring and plot to rid themselves of their unwanted neighbour.Director Claude Berri shows great skill in bringing the classic Marcel Pagnol novel to the big screen and does it without losing any of the integrity of the source material, making a masterpiece of cinema in the process. Having seen it for the first time some years ago as part of French class at school, it has not disappointed on repeated viewings.The acting from all the cast is impeccable, especially the three leads, Yves Montard, Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil, whose names are not among the most famous in the history of French cinema for nothing. Casting Elisabeth Depardieu (at the time the wife of Gerard) in the role of Jean's wife adds something to the realism and Ernestine Mazurowna acquits herself admirably in her only film role to date as Jean's daughter.The film acts as a beautifully observed study in human nature and morality. What I love about the book is that unlike the majority of fiction that labels actions in black or white, all through both parts of this drama there are shades of grey. Despicable though the actions of Papet are, he is working for the benefit of Ugolin rather than himself. Also, though most of the villagers appear to suspect that Papet and Ugolin have blocked up the spring, none seem willing to do anything about it and they just watch Jean on his way to his inevitable destruction, so the whole blame can not be left at the doorstep of the Soubeyrans. It is interesting how different the characters of the three leads are. Simple-minded Ugolin gradually loses patience and is corrupted by the far more intelligent and hard-hearted Papet into following his greed. Jean remains steadfast despite all the setbacks he faces, remaining good and ever optimistic despite his increasing troubles.The decision to use Giuseppe Verdi's 'The Force of Destiny' as the title music is entirely apt, though makes more sense after the viewing of 'Manon des Sources.' The cinematography is also superb, making a stunning backdrop to the film and capturing the mood of the story perfectly. Though it is debatable as to whether or not this film or the sequel is superior, I prefer to think of them as two halves of a whole rather than two separate entities. Manon des Sources is pretty much required viewing for anyone who wants to get a fuller appreciation of 'Jean de Florette.' Cinema at its best.

But what makes this and its sequel, Manon des Sources (1986), jewels of the French cinema is the story and the characterizations, which go hand in hand. There is genius in how naturally and almost inevitably the story unfolds. Although I haven't read the novel by Marcel Pagnol, I'm sure he's the genius. And this is not to slight Claude Berri's direction which is invisible and at the same time in total control, so that the film is simply a work of art. The characters are true to themselves, and what they do seems natural because of who they are. Jean Florette (Depardieu) fails because he puts too much faith in science, knowledge and the good will and fairness of his fellow man. (He should have listened to his suspicious wife!) Ugolin (Auteuil), whose selfishness and little guy envy lead him to do the harm that he does, is not a despicable character. We do not hate him the way Manon understandably does. He is a man of weakness who gave into greed. Papet (Montand), believes in the lineage of man, in property, money-all the standard burgher values. He is led to do his dirty deeds because of who he is. What is so, so superior in Florette compared to most movies is the lack of propaganda, the lack of adherence to some political or philosophic preconception. What shines forth is people living their lives and falling into some very human traps. I am reminded of Balzac and Guy De Maupassant in the depiction of French peasant and petit bourgeois life and psychology.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

I will never forget the mix of horror, pity and satisfaction which I felt when Manon exposed Cesar's crime in all its dimensions.  Yves Montand creates a character so real (though monumental) that you respond to his undoing as you would to that of someone you know personally -- not some character in a movie.

However he and his uncle Cesar Soubeyran (Yves Montard) don't have sufficient water on their land to feed a profitable crop. When they find an unused spring on a neighbour's land they block in and plan to buy the land. When the land is inherited by Jean (Depardieu) and his family, Galinette and Cesar plan his downfall so they can later buy his land and use his spring for their crops.This is a beautifully filmed movie - almost a tourist film for the France countryside. However the plot is not so picturesque, but rather deals with the conflicting human qualities of hope and greed, enthusiasm and envy. Jean represents the spirit of hope, a city worker who comes to the farm with new plans for breeding rabbits, growing vegetables etc., all to the scorn of the locals who believe his mad schemes will never work. Cesar represents the greed of the film, he drives the plan to frustrate Jean to the point that he'll leave and sell his land for cheap. The main character is Galinette, and it is him that we're meant to follow. He starts with the gentle dream of building up his land and growing his flowers but during the course of the film he is changed by the envy of Jean and the greed added to by Cesar. While Jean is the study of a man driven by hope who fights frustration and despair throughout, Galinette gives into greed to achieve his dream. It isn't reading too much into it to see Cesar as the devil driving Galinette while Jean is watched over by Manon (Mazurowna) his angel daughter.The performances are good with Auteuil (Galinette) good as the man torn by his desires. Depardieu and Montard (Cesar) are good as the flip sides of humanity. Mazurowna is good as Manon, she doesn't have too much to do but is good considering her age. The three male leads are the key and don't disappoint - they are all totally believable in their roles as devils, angels and mankind placed in the bodies of French farmers.This film is powerful as it gradually shows us how greed corrupts and perhaps how hope is not a quality appreciated by all - especially where envy exists. It is difficult to stomach because we're meant to like Galinette from the start but the ease with which he changes it alarming, but all the more frightening by the way it could easily happen to anyone in their life.The film is not complete as it is part one with the sequel Manon des Sources providing the conclusion. On it's own the conclusions it leaves you with are perhaps realistic but quite bleak none the less. This is an interesting, beautifully shot study of human nature in all it's horror.

It was shot on numerous locations in the Vaucluse department of Provence in the southeast of France and is part of a duology which was succeeded by Manon des Sources (1986).

Though having their plan ruined they are dead set on finding a way to gain their obstacle, so when a man from the village named Jean Cadoret moves in to his newly inherited property with his wife AimÃ¨e and their adolescent daughter Manon, the two farmers decides to mislead him.Subtly and acutely directed by French filmmaker Claude Berri (1934-2009) and with it's ardent and naturalistic milieu depictions and efficient narrative structure, this historic period piece, at the time the most expensive French film in French history, draws a throughout engaging portrayal of a kind-hearted and loving husband and father with an urban background who whilst struggling to create a good life for himself and his family in a rural area at the turn of the twentieth century, becomes a victim of deception and prejudice. This mid-1980s co-production between France, Italy and Switzerland, known as part of a movement in France during the 1980s called heritage cinema which mainly consisted of costume dramas, has a powerful score by French composer and arranger Jean-Claude Petit, based on Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi's Italian opera The Force of Destiny (1862), which reinforces the films pivotal atmosphere.Produced by French producers Pierre Grunstein and Alain PoirÃ© (1917-2000) and notable for it's wonderful production design by production designer Bernard VÃ©zat and cinematography by French director and cinematographer Bruno Nuytten, this character-driven and dialog-driven countryside epic which examines themes like interpersonal relations, greed, faith and the distinctions between human goodness and human cruelty is impelled by the splendid acting performances by French actor and producer GÃ©rard Depardieu, Italian-born French actor and singer Yves Montand (1921-1991) and French actor, director and screenwriter Daniel Auteuil.

Pagnol, the author of the book, had a trilogy turned into film in the thirties in France. These films, one of which Pagnol directed, contain less melodrama than Jean but were closer to the author's intent. Not that this matters, for screenwriters and directors need a peg to hang their hats.Montand in his own way resembles Brando's Don Corleone, but with only one surviving relative, ugly Ugolin. Daniel Auteil in that part is the linchpin on which the film either works or founders, and his performance is great. Inside his plain being is a conscience, unlike Montand or Depardieu's Jean for that matter, who takes his family down to ruin in his quest to farm and populate the land with rabbits. Jean is Sisyphus, pushing the stone up the hill, not realizing that the gods have fixed the game. When Auteil sees the end results of his game playing, he breaks into tears, and in the sequel, does the honorable thing and 'falls on his sword.'Because the film is melodrama, we get carried along with Jean's effort and want to see Manon get even with Montand; we rush out to the video store for the sequel, but when all is over, we've not been changed, but rather have been to the theater.

He was in his 60's by this point, but many of the roles that he was made famous for (Wages of Fear, Z) were years behind him. Here the role of the Monseiur Soubeyran, aka Le Papet, is one of those major, awesomely commanding roles for an older actor to take on, even as it's not the most complex character of the lot. He basically gets to be conniving and cunning, and yet I think that's not the tough part to play; the hard part, I'd wager, is to make a human being out of someone who lacks empathy, or even basic sympathy. This is where all of the troubles lie for Jean (Depardieu) when he inherits a farm that was left to him by his mother, which in turn was an inheritance from her brother... I should also mention that he was accidentally killed as Le Papet was there, and sort of, you know, let it happen.How does he have some human quality to him? What can Montand play? I think the part of the intelligence is one thing, and of course one can see this man as a villain in a similar respect to the great villains who puppet-master their greed - the summary line refers to Daniel Plainview from There Will be Blood, but also Noah Cross from Chinatown (also a movie where water - how it's drained, where it flows to, how it's plugged counts more than anything and to where). He has a plan - plug up the water spring that is there on the property so that Jean has to resort to a much father spring, without the help of a mule (which his nephew could give him, but he won't by instruction) - and goes for it, hook line and sinker.Something about these men, who are the sort of very real monsters who ruin lives in everyday life, keep us watching, and with Montand I think it's that he imbues him with some odd, continuous form of dignity, at least from his perspective. He sees who owns what as just formalities - if you want something, you just take it, even if it takes years of plotting (not that a little bad luck, like a lack of rain, can't help along the process). Montand very likely didn't *like* this character, but understands him and certainly knows how to make him come alive and, of all things, make the audience see what he'll plot for his nephew to do next.Jean de Florette is a very rich film in how Claude Berri presents the story and characters since this theme of who cares and who shows what to one another, what it means to be a good neighbor (or not) and how everyone just wants to try to get what's theirs, or do from day to day, month to month. Depardeiu gets to play someone who is the opposite of Le Papet - Jean is someone who has grown up in a city, not a farm, but sees the possibilities and hopes (or just knows) that he can overcome things through having knowledge from books. A story like this might be tougher to pull off set in the 21st century just due to how many things have changed (better transportation, better weather prediction, loans), but there's still a resonance to the themes completely because Jean is a dreamer and yet at the same time puts in a lot of hard work - he deserves what he's working hard for. Shouldn't he get it, if not just for himself his wife and daughter? If I had to nitpick the film (it's great but not perfect, if that makes sense) some of the music is a little on-the-nose in some parts, like when Jean is running outside as a storm may (or may not) come to answer his prayers, and I wondered why the townspeople, shown occasionally, have such an immediate animosity to Jean just due to his hunch and being a city person. But these are minor, or I can let that go as far as 'it was the time/small towners', in the grand scope of what the film is trying to accomplish. You have a force of good (making one's own place prosper for oneself and family) and a force of not so good (total meddling to do a take-over, which one can see in action in major ways every day with corporations taking over small businesses and so on).But when it comes to Auteil, he has the best character to play, the one with the most conflict. He's not shown as someone very handsome, on the contrary Manon, Jean's daughter, calls him ugly and judges him. Maybe she can sense through some intuition something is fishy about him (and at times the wife doesn't like him either, only Jean is fine with him). Auteil has to play a character who is having to be the friendly neighbor, the cordial type, one who can help and give advice and be conversational and hear out Jean's ideas about how to do this or that with his crops and rabbit breeding. But what happens if he gets some empathy, which he has deep down? How does he reconcile it? I loved seeing this actor deal with this character on screen, and it's a shame Auteil missed out on some acting prizes for his work (or rather, I should say, in America).Beautifully shot (it looks like it was made recently with its solid 35mm film stock) and acted to such a high degree, this is a quality drama about success, failure and manipulation of people and land.

The death is assumed to be an accident. Le Papet directs Ugolin to block up a natural spring on the property and destroy the place so the new owner would sell it cheap.

The joy is in observing the rather articulate nuances that the characters must undertake when particular farming tasks require particular tools and items for a job at hand; the film eventually coming to resemble a tale about a man most probably as alien to farming as the audience and enjoying it as much as we enjoy watching his taking up of this challenge. The farming within the film, in its specificities revolving around the planning; the predicting; the techniques and the use of certain items and animals for certain events, is as intrinsic as the film's core study of greed and the capitalist infused garnering of an industrial item, an item which will bring large amounts of personal wealth and riches, eventually at the expense of others. The film eventually coming to form a remarkably executed, heart breakingly tragic, blackly comic, devilishly well put together period drama from France well worth checking out.The film begins with a young man named Ugolin (Auteuil) returning home to the South of France, and his uncle's farm, having served time with the French army; the soundtrack a dry and sleepy orchestral tune suggesting much in the way of travels and tiredness, only momentarily breaking off into louder bursts of a much more positive tone as he nears home. Upon arriving home, Ugolin takes clear glee in rushing to a small patch of soil on the grounds and unwrapping a plant of some kind so he may observe it; something he appears to enjoy more than being reconciled with his uncle after such a stretch of time and furthermore suggesting an inclination towards agricultural work, his dream eventually revealed to be one of which revolves around the growing and selling of flowers for a living. His uncle is Cesar (Montand), an elderly man whom demands Ugolin find a wife and have children in the near future so that the land may be passed down and kept within the family; his other eye on a stretch of land lying nearby to his own, a stretch functional enough as it stands and with a natural spring beneath it capable of escalating the quality of the goods that only Cesar knows of, but a stretch already owned by a man no way willing to just sell up.Berri spends a good deal of time with these two farmers, their dreams; their positions and their core characteristics filling up most of the film's opening act. We come to like them during this early part and their blackly funny misadventures as well as their dry observations on life and newfound situations which open up as a result of other events. We side with young Ugolin, this simple young man whom has only just returned from national service and wishes to move into floristry. It is only when the titular Jean of Florette arrives, in the form of GÃ©rard Depardieu, that we see the true nature of them; Jean being the rightful heir to that of the land when Cesar and Ugolin accidentally-on-purpose murder the owner of the land thus bringing Jean into the equation following a string of other legal complications with the rightful land owner.Jean and his family of wife Aimee (Elisabeth Depardieu) and young daughter Manon (Mazurowna) are not used to such surroundings; their previous incarnation of living in a more urbanite locale ill preparing them for what they come into contact with here, the beauty and calmness of the locale coming to resemble mere surface featurettes as those within plot and brew. The obvious distinctions between themselves and those more attributed to the land arrive in the form of their clear differences in clothing, as well as their talk of things of a more cultured nature, namely the opera, as on occasion Aimee breaks out int chorus of song to Jean's own harmonica tunes.What unfolds is a game of cat and mouse and hope and frustration between the two farmers, in Ugolin and Cesar, and the Florettes whom hang around much to the annoyance of their neighbours whom still want the land, know of its true flourishing nature and retain the spring as their secret. Jean's gradual coming around to realise how wondrous and how magnificent the locale is, and how enthralling the individual tasks and procedures which make up farming echoes our own coming around to feel similarly towards the film. Just as agricultural activity is fresh to that of Jean, the arrival of he and his family acts as a fresh and very crisp presence within the film to that of the audience; the very gradual bringing of the audience around on Berri's behalf to have us see the two original farmers as cruel and calculating businessmen as this initial outsider and his family capture our hearts, is outstanding. The film is a really well executed drama, a wonderful piece persistently flicking from tone to tone and character to character in perfect tandem; a film working on a level of family drama, fish out of water storytelling and dark comedy culminating in something quite special.

The film draws its strength from the simple, straightforward force of its story and from the elemental virtues, vices, and passions of its characters sturdy peasant farmers working the arid hills of southern France. Yves Montand is the wealthy landowner who hopes to secure a fertile plot of land for his simpleminded nephew (Daniel Auteuil, hiding his leading man looks behind ugly backwoods makeup) by blocking its all-important source of water, forcing the new tenant (hunchbacked Gerard Depardieu) to sell the property cheap. There's quite a lot of background to establish, but from that simple plot hook Berri and his cast have created a leisurely (yet surprisingly involving) melodrama. It ends on an unresolved, downbeat note, a tease for the sequel, which will continue the saga with the surviving characters ten years later.

That's the plot exposition basically but of course what we really have here is a study of on the one hand avarice, as exhibited by the calculating Montand and his occasionally conscience - affected nephew Auteuil against the nobility, enthusiasm and family - loving values of Depardieu's character. The fact that by the film's end, the former appears to have won of course will be overturned in the sequel (which I've yet to view) as Jean's young daughter Manon witnesses the deception of Montand and Auteuil as they glory in their apparent victory, even at the cost of Jean's death. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting characterful - you really feel that the actors fully inhabit their roles, and the story just unfolds in front of you like a classic novel made flesh. I loved the film whilst accepting criticisms of its being old - fashioned and conservative. But in the era, when it was made, of Rambo, Arnie and any number of SFX movies this film must have seemed then, as now, an oasis in a desert. Too bad the oasis never appeared to Jean de Florette!

When they find a foreign actor who really can act very well, they try to forget as soon as possible that he or she isn't French; chauvinistic as the French are, they prefer their own movies over foreign ones; making movies sometimes seems like mass-production;... Because of this mass-production it's also a fact that not too many movies are excellent (just like in Hollywood), but from time to time something special comes along like this Jean de Florette.The movie has been based on a novel from Marcel Pagnol and tells the story of Jean, son of Florette and a hunch-back, who moves with his family from the city to a small town in the Provence. He has inherited a small farm house with a spring (very precious in a region where there isn't too much water) and a lot of land around it. But an old man and his only remaining relative already were interested in the property themselves. They need the spring water for growing their flowers and when they find out that Jean de Florette will move in, they block up the source. With pleasure they see how Jean gets desperate and how he tries to water his crops with water from wells far afield. The hard labor and the hot summer break Jean's health and the hearts of his wife and daughter, but all the old man and his relative can think about is the cheap land which will soon be available again...I admit that I'm normally not a big fan of French cinema, but when a movie is good, it doesn't matter where it comes from.

Instead, an intricate tale of greed, family ties, and blindness to evil.It tells the story of Galinet (Daniel Auteuil), who dreams of all the riches he could gain from selling blood-red carnations to local florists. After his grandfather (the fantastic Yves Montand) 'accidentally' kills the owner of the next-door farm, Galinet sets his sights on the plush, fertile soil of the land. However, a northern hunchback, Jean (Gerard Depardieu) inherits the farm, and plans to settle there with his family indefinitely. Galinet and his grandfather attempt to stir up trouble amongst the townsfolk over the hunchback, > with disastrous results.All 3 main performances are exquisite. Auteuil and Montand (a former lover of Marilyn Monroe) appear loving yet deceitful, without turning the audience against them. Depardieu brings an innocent freshness as the hunchback who naively believes that they want to be his friends.Indeed, the direction is also beautifully done. There is no singular viewpoint to enable the audience to side with a particular character. We see the strong love between the grandson and his relative, but also the underlying greed and selfish motivations. The camera does not waste too much time on languid shops of lush landscape, but involves them almost as another character. When Jean - who is desperate during a drought for water to feed his vegetation - hears a clap of thunder in the middle of the night, he runs out into the garden, whooping for joy. We see monstrous, looming hills, with flashing skies behind. Jean realises the rain is in another valley, and breaks down sobbing. He knows he has nothing to feed his family, and begins shouting at the sky and mountains, as if they - and God - are the enemy.There is no point in seeing this movie if you do not follow it with its sequel, Manon des Sources.

Whenever one of them doubts whether his bad deeds against Jean should continue, the other is always ready with a justification. The combination of Jean's actions with those of his neighbors prove dangerous for him.The story is set against stunning countryside -- even in the midst of showing its most unforgiving side, the natural surroundings always seem gorgeous.The acting is outstanding. The film is at heart a character study, and the main characters are able to bear up under strong study. A lot can be read simply in the faces of Jean and the peasants, and the final shot of a child's face is especially suggestive.The film lacks a certain charm that keeps it out of the ranks of the truly great films, but it is well done and worth watching, and can provoke a good discussion afterwards.

They wish to buy his land, because they and only they know its true value. The two schemers offer to help Jean, but really they only want to keep close track of what he is doing and has planned so that they may persuade and influence him to that which will not succeed so that he will be forced to sell - to them. To fully appreciate the story and this film, one must see the sequel 'Manon of the Spring', where the final ironic tragic ending is revealed. To quote the bible ...am I my brother's keeper, it seems a perfect epithet for this movie.

Their dream to escape the 'city hell' and live in the peaceful rustic idyll, is gradually destroyed by their seemingly friendly neighbour, with tragic results. Set in a small, rural community in 1920's post-war France, the film centers around our most basic human necessity - water and the two men who are each convinced that one farm holds the key to their future. With a strong cast led by Gerard Depardieu and Yves Montand , this is a beautifully shot film with just a touch of nostalgia that will leave you longing to live in the stunning French countryside. An unmissable film.

Only after seeing Manon of the Spring did I understand why Claud Berri did that to me.The two films should be considered two halves of the whole, not really thought of as a film and a sequel. By the end of the second half, the viewer has been made to feel and be convinced that there is hope of justice in the world. One cannot escape the fact that evil actions have consequences, even if it takes a generation or two before they become apparent. That is the underlying message of this pair of films. Never, in any play, film or novel have I seen this truth portrayed more convincingly.The performances of Ives Montand and Gerard Depardieu in Jean de Florette are magnificent, and the story sets the viewer up for the resolution of the conflicts and the surprising revelations of the sequel, Manon of the Spring.This pair of films should not be missed. If you have a choice, I recommend the subtitled version over the dubbed version for non-French speakers.WATCH THESE FILMS!

Watch him in the minor role of Reynaldo in Branagh's Hamlet, and you will change your mind.  In contrast, Jack Lemmon stinks in the film.But to get to the point, there is a specific and profound moral in this marvelous film that is unfortunately softened by what I consider to be its inferior sequel Manon should not be able to get the spring going so quickly.  Obtuseness in moral matters can lead to the same ends as serious attempts to commit evil. The moral demands on humans approach the limitless.  Yes, those two guys are despicable, but they're not monsters.  They don't want to kill M. Jean, but they succeed in doing so.  All that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.   Or something slightly wrong.

It takes place in a rural community in Southern France.  The plot revolves around his relationship with his neighbour, who is a hunchback, and the things that he does to try and obtain the land. The protagonist in the movie is the farmer who wants to grow carnations for a living.  He spends his time plotting with his uncle as to how he will be able to buy his neighbours land. The antagonist is a hunchback from the city who inherits his grandfathers farm.  The main conflict for the protagonist is the man against man conflict that comes from his neighbour.  Even though the man acts kindly to his neighbour, he is also trying to do things that will sabotage his efforts to create a productive farm.  The carnation farmer also has to deal with some man against himself conflict because he does not always feel right about sneaking around and trying to force his neighbour to sell his land.

The secret of Jean de Florette's past, and an unexpected little secret it is at that, is discovered in the second film, and it's well worth the wait to find it out!  Actually, I am surprised not to have heard a word here of mention about the two fine novels by Marcel Pagnol (whom I believe also directed the first Jean de Florette film back in the 50's); it's interesting to see how closely the films follow the action and plot in the novels.  In general, I would recommend Jean de Florette to an adult audience (since children may find the subtitles too much of a challenge for a short attention span).  And though I'm certain a lot of English speakers don't ordinarily like reading subtitles, je pense qu'une personne d'une culture differente puisse apprecier Jean de Florette et Manon des Sources;.  That is to say, Jean de Florette is a tender human story with universal appeal that I think most people would enjoy.

Two men conspire to destroy the farm of another man so that they can buy his property cheap. There is very little redemption, and the farthest possible thing from a happy ending.There aren't any real plot twists. The interesting twists come at the end of the sequel, Manon of the Spring. This first episode is pure character study. Performances by Depardieu and Montand are absolutely first-rate.Depardieu is an interesting actor in a role made for him. Unless most actors, who study movement and dance, and move quite elegantly, Depardieu is a big clumsy guy. In this particular role, as an city-educated hunchback trying to be a farmer, he seems pluperfect. He is not hampered by his clumsiness, but uses it to lift the role to the apex of realism. I bought it completely. I loved the scene where he impersonates his rabbits.Those of you who find him impossibly incompetent in English-language films will be astounded by the excellence of his portrayal, and will understand a bit of why his stature is deserved.This film is excellent, but a tad slow. The sequel, Manon, is a much faster-moving film.

Jean de Florette is a cripple, yet hunchbacked and in feigning health, he makes the back-breaking hike to a well a long distance away to provide water. If only he knew what the two men knew.It's a nicely crafted French film but it's the sort of film that leaves you feeling hollow. I kept wanting something good to come of our hero, but no. The townsfolk shun the cripple, and his family. Nobody comes to aid him, in fact everybody is always on the side of the two villains of the piece, and of course the dramatic irony that de Florette thinks Ugolin is helping him is more savage than I'm used to.It's well written, directed and acted but it's not a satisfying film. Not having seen the sequel Manon des Sources which apparently piles just desserts on Ugolin and Cesar, I can't say this film intrinsically wooed me. I joked at the end how I would have loved to see Ugolin and Cesar club each other to death, or something that could re-enflame my faith in a just world, it would have been a fairly poor film then but it would have made me feel better.Really, this film is for lovers of fine cinema rather than your general movie-loving public. I'm a little of both, so I can appreciate this film for all its splendour but I still guiltily like a happy ending.

Anyone who can credit a mere child in the fields as the nemesis of her father's murderers has to be a romanticist at heart, and I rather doubt Pagnol was any less than realist, must be a subscriber to a Gollywood of smoke and mirrors and easy self-assurances. NO city type, much less a country hick, as in Stix Nix Hicks Pix, could begin to aspire to the ingenuousness of Jean in or out of Florette. No, fellow cineastes, this one is a shill and a clunker, themewise that is, because the on-screen realization is more than competent and believable and persuasive. But, personally, I found Yves here and Gerard as well, a distant second and third to Daniel's three-dimensional and more than human witness to greed and corruption and murder. It's HIS vehicle, donkeys and cartwheels and all. For the rest, I give you the Marsellais of Psgnol's Fanny trilogy, which is, every bit. another candidate for cinemstic glory and box office, like Bergman's Fanny. och Alexander.

Beyond how the valorized title family ever came together this movie has beaucoup des problems.My sister and I were discussing this movie and it's sequel a few years back. Thinking I was making a non-controversial remark, I said the second movie was obviously better. She yelped NO WAY! The first one was way better. I thought she must be recalling it wrong, or maybe I was. It's taken me a while, but I finally rewatched this last night.And... I was right. It's exactly the way I remember it, and I've never viewed it a 2nd time in the twenty years that passed, since it was released in '86. It is precisely as deliberate, plodding, overlong, tiresome, repetitive, obvious... as I recall.Since a laugh might disrupt the sermon, there isn't an ounce of humor in it. And for a movie that has no developments in its 2nd act, Jean D.F. is easily half an hour too long. It just sits there, and viewers are asked to do nothing beyond identifying the virtuous and villainous within a minute of their appearance. Then the pattern begins; each new scene again affirms that Jean, and the 2 genetically-blessed females in his household, are virtuous, and that the ugly or old Soubeyrans are treacherous dogs. This movie has NO dramatic arc and no payoff. It's a completely non-rich, non-nourishing viewing experience. Oh? The villagers don't reach out to the new family? Well neither do we see Jean & co. make any effort to connect to the community in the 3 years (!) they're there, unless the community comes to their farm offering gifts. Without Ugolin they'd be monks. Mrs. Jean and Manon have no emotional life whatsoever in this. The part of Mrs. Jean is barely written. Manon is a taciturn, blank-faced little robot. They're both infinitely less interesting or likable than Ugolin, even with his faults.The height of absurdity is reached when Jean & co arrive at the farm; he plays the theme music on his harmonica and Mrs. Jean chimes in (a la Snow White) with some tra-la-las. Jean embraces and caresses Mrs. Jean, framed perfectly by a rustic window. Guh!, it's like porn for women. The only way to squeeze more pastiche into the frame is if a bird landed on her finger, and began to tweet along. It's a powerfully unsubtle image that will probably never be matched for sheer corniness.The sequel Manon of the Spring is amazing, supplying all the development and emotion that this never gets around to; sorrow, pity, pathos, humor, rueful ironies, and of course that devastating ending. The fates visited upon Ugolin and Soubeyran are truly terrible. Plus, it actually has pacing! This is a tedious obstacle to endure on the way to the superior sequel.
