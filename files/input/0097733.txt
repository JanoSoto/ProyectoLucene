[{"Title":"Quite possibly one of the best sequels of all time...","Date":"20 September 2003","Score":"57 out of 71 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Lethal Weapon 2 is the type of sequel you don't screw with, for fear of getting seriously beat up if you do. Luckily the praise comes as easily as the film is good -- and boy, is it good.If you haven't seen Lethal Weapon (1987), get off your computer, drop that Cheez-It out of your hand, rush to your closest video outlet and buy it. If you have seen it, then drop that Cheez-It out of your hand, rush to your closest video outlet and buy the sequel, Lethal Weapon 2. It's a real ball-breaker, a bruiser, the type of film where the heroes get beat up mercilessly but when they get mad, boy are they mad, and they tear apart everything in their path that is standing in their way. There's a particular shoot-out scene aboard a docked ship where Riggs (Mel Gibson) goes on a rampage and really kicks butt with a vengeance.But I think I'm getting ahead of myself.The film opens with a high-speed car chase on a freeway in Downtown LA. Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are in hot pursuit, tearing up Murtaugh's wife's brand-new car as they chase the speeder through an underground tunnel, up a bridge, and so on and so forth.When they finally catch the speeder they find African gold hidden in the back of his truck. Soon they are being threatened to stay off of the case by African diplomats, one of whom Riggs really enjoys annoying. They can't arrest them because of diplomatic immunity, so Riggs goes in and shoots up the place where they're staying.Riggs finds himself a new girl (Patsy Kensit), while Murtaugh protects a federal witness named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a lovable little blabbermouth who likes being one of the cops. He waddles around throughout the film like a little eager puppy, ready to do anything he's told. Of course Riggs and Murtaugh pick on him throughout the movie, but their friendship is a sort of love-to-hate, explained in Lethal Weapon 4 (1997).What a hard action movie/sequel this is. I had heard nothing very positive about this movie until right before I saw it. I sat down, watched it directly after I watched Lethal Weapon, and realized just how great of a sequel it really is. It's not repetitive -- it continues the character progression and friendship seen at the end of Lethal Weapon, while at the same time adding a bit more humor than the first film.One of the things I praise about the first Lethal Weapon movie is that the characters didn't just suddenly agree to like each other at the end of the movie like so many films. They gradually learned to trust each other throughout the film, adding a sense of true friendship and realism to the film. In Lethal Weapon 2, the friendship between Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh is definitely expanded more to the point where they're best buddies. Most of the time when there is a sequel to a cop-buddy film, the directors and writers are afraid to continue the friendship. They seem to forget the end of the original film, and in the second film the characters hate each other again and the progress of friendship starts all over again. (As seen in such films as Another 48 Hrs.)But Lethal Weapon 2 is brave -- it isn't afraid to continue the story. I think that might be part of what makes it such a great, well-rounded series. It never really repeats itself, it always seems eager to move forward and ignore the past. The first film was a humorous, hard cop-buddy film about two opposites learning to trust each other. The second movie is a continuation of their friendship. The third film is almost a full-out comedy. And the fourth film is a tribute to the first three. Darn good film-making here.Lethal Weapon 2 is quite possibly one of the best sequels of all time. It avoids repetitions, it avoids cop-buddy clichÃ©s, and when it all comes down to it, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are such an amazing trio, that even if this film did follow the routine procedures I'd still love it. And you can't say that about many movies.

This is no exception. The Lethal Weapon series has never been especially noted for its intellect but it has something that a lot of action films lack heart. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's winning chemistry created some of the most tender moments in the series and Lethal Weapon 2 excels because they make the audience care about their characters. This movie is by far the best in the series with tones of moments registering directly to the viewer. Gibson and Glover provide these characters with depth that could easily have been lacking and the ending of this film leaves the audience actually feeling the love these two men have for each other. And, as a bonus, Lethal Weapon 2 digs even deeper into one of the protagonist's past, shedding even more light as to why he is the way he is.

It retains all of the elements that made the first film so darn entertaining and adds some new elements.As all actors from the first movie appear in the second one as well its pretty clear what you can expect acting wise and surprise, surprise The acting is still stellar, close to perfection. Mel Gibson is always good and in the second installment of the series he gets to be a little more wild and add even more nuances to the character. For example we get to see Riggs hit on women which adds an entire new side to him as the side we saw in the first film was of him mourning. Also we find out how his wife dies in a beautifully underacted scene (if you want to know how she dies you'll have to see the movie). Danny Glover returns as well and he plays the character pretty much as he did in the first film which is good because the character he plays is the one who is not supposed to change. He is meant to be square and combined with the character of Riggs this becomes highly entertaining. However, a new element is put into the mix to make it even more entertaining, Leo Getz, played beautifully by Joe Pesci and is to this day still one of his most memorable characters. He is funny and fast talking but most importantly he is a crook and when you put him together with Riggs and Murtaugh the mix becomes explosive. The main villains are played by Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor and they are also good and a bit more developed than the villains of the first movie obviously because they had to focus more on the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh in the first movie. Riggs' love interest is played Patsy Kensit and she is good if a bit underdeveloped. The story is excellent and is almost better than the story in the first one. It is entertaining and funny and best of all the incredible chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is maintained and is almost as good as it was in the first movie. Furthermore the addition of Joe Pesci was a very nice touch because he immediately makes the scenes with him, Gibson and Glover even more interesting and entertaining. The plot with the villains is kept relatively simple like in the first film, which is good because the goal for the film is entertainment not to be thought provoking.The action of the film is kept in the same style as in the first movie and it is still both exhilarating and entertaining. The effects are still relatively realistic and this of course gives the movie a level of credibility that is sorely needed in many modern action movies.All in all a worthy sequel and an excellent film on its own. 8/10 "},{"Title":"A really lethal sequel","Date":"8 August 2000","Score":"27 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return to kick heads and shoot bad guys for the second time, as Riggs and Murtaugh, the Oscar and Felix of law enforcement in Lethal Weapon 2.

The chemistry between Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover)is still remarkable. The only thing now is that Riggs is less self-destructive as he was in the first movie, but I guess it's so that in the first he tries to get over the loss of his wife and he somehow has moved on. Not as exciting as the first, but still very believable. Some historical-political elements that provides some surprising educational facts are delivered here in the movie that's obscurely mentioned in classrooms. Here it takes aim the the South African apartheid fiasco that ran from 1948, up until 1994 by Nelson Mandela who over-turned the government and became President of South Africa putting a stop to apartheid. During it's dying stages, the government provided segregated communities to it diverse ethnics and tried to promote theocracy. The South Africans depicted may have been over the top, but the political upheaval was executed immaculately. In spite of that cultural reference, there's a setback to it as well. I don't understand why did the South Africans killed Riggs' wife and now have targeted his girlfriend. What's up with that? The whole logic was completely null and void and has no logic to it at all. Some editing should have been taken to consideration. It's still an enjoyable film, but the first one stands above them all.

So Donner's salt and pepper pairing who clearly have a late = developing teenage crush on one another do their own thing with fine disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one worries because the bad guys are white South Africans - surely a worrying example of police racism in itself? Inside Rudd's (Joss Ackland - eminently hissable) office the decor is designed and lit to resemble as far as possible the Fuhrerbunker and just in case some rather dumb moviegoers miss the point,he and his men are referred to as nazis at regular intervals. For me the only bright spot in the movie was when Mel Gibson turned up at an anti - apartheid demonstration carrying a banner bearing the inscription End Aparthied Now. The intensely irritating Joe Pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the boys' shoulders by following them around yapping incessantly like a badly-trained puppy.This would be bearable if there was the remotest possibility of him ending up in a concrete overcoat,but sadly he survives to irritate another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems in a world of her own,perhaps not believing her luck at being cast opposite Mel Gibson who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home which appears to have been washed up on a beach somewhere.Shortly after consummating their affair they come under fire from a number of helicopters that fire enough rounds into Mel's caravan to keep the U.S. Army in Iraq going for six months. Fortunately he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause coitus interruptus just as they are going for seconds and his barking warns them of the imminent attack.I hope he got a special bone as a reward. The film climaxes(without interruption from Mel's dog) on a cargo ship bound for Nazi Germany (sorry,South Africa),when Mel and Danny murder so many members of the master race that I lost count.Despite jiggling around like Bonnie and Clyde under the impact of a hail of bullets,Mel survives,curled up in his partner's arms like a small child with a wise and benevolent father.Take that,Apartheid!

This film is sadly just another testament to how Hollywood is full of itself and views itself as being ahead of the curve. When it was conceived, it was not yet known that apartheid was going to fall, although Pieter Botha's government had made some extremely limited reforms. However, given Mr. de Klerk's election in 1989 (the year of the film's release), it suddenly lost its raison d'Ãªtre. It has some historical accuracy in that sanctions-busting activity took place during the apartheid regime, but drug-smuggling was not among the activities widely practised and the portrayal of South Africa as a gangster state is inaccurate.

Same cast, same crew, same assets.The problem at first is partly that we don't know who the bad guys are. We have no reason to fear or hate them. We just know that Mel and Danny have to be in on some new awful crime situation. That requires faith, so okay, we keep watching. The opening chase is highly kinetic and violent and spectacular, if you like that kind of thing. It is also a heads up for a couple scenes later that are also really spectacular &#x97;a ridiculous machine gun festival from a helicopter (if they have helicopters that have rocket grenades and boom, that's that), and a really ridiculous yanking down of a spectacular building with a GMC pickup truck (an amazing highlight of the movie).Yeah, it's a wonderful mixed bag.

Lethal Weapon 2 is the sort of film in which characters tumble out of fifteenth storey windows; land in a communal swimming pool; thrash around in the water for a while, before getting up and out so that they may dust themselves off and move onto the next set piece. That was fine in the first film, because it was nonsense and we knew it was and the film knew it was as well - what was important was the fact it was propping up this really intimate and often touching story about a man going through a process of shelving his suicidal ideation and rediscovering the love for his job. Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs was that character in the first, someone stumbling once again upon that wash of emotion often referred to as job satisfaction, a man once bent on mourning the death of his wife and generally uninterested in living for much longer - the first scene in this second instalment has him state his love for this job as he hares down the street in an unmarked police car chasing some villains. Go figure.This second Lethal Weapon film is, at least to a degree, again Riggs' film; a piece depicting his dissipating grief as he sees fit to kick off a relationship with a newfound woman, as well as allowing him to tie up some rather personal loose ends when the true extent of his wife's death becomes clearer through the adventure he undertakes here. This would have been fine had there felt as if there was some actual heart to proceedings, and the said content didn't feel like a papering over what are essentially a series of stunts involving helicopters; cars and exploding toilets. If there was a mite of honesty to what transpires, and forgive me if it strikes you as a premature reveal, then I dare say Gibson's character should have passed on there and then in faithful accomplice Roger Murtagh's (Glover) arms on that container ship during this edition's finale.The good news is that Gibson and Glover are good value. Their combination, as was with the first, plays off itself with a series of binary opponents where Murtagh wears his suit to work, Riggs is more laid back and casual in his dress; where one of them finds cheap office humour hilarious, the other deems a good deal of maturing is in order, in fact the two actors rebound off one another really well and they genuinely look as if they're enjoying one another's presence. It is Murtagh's contemplations this time that dominate, a man nearing retirement but without a hobby to occupy his time, while his disassociation with the large family he bares begins with the fact he eats tuna when all others have stopped and realises just how old his daughter is getting when she appears in a television advertisement which, in a few words, takes him aback.The adventure involves South African politicians who use their stature as a front to disguise that of a smuggling ring. The leads are effectively in it together to fight racism, what with the fact this group are South Africans in favour of the then-ruling South African Apartheid regime and act as the film's villains. It is here the film takes a shy, if unbalanced, glide into the deep end of issue movie making, or the addressing of an issue for a piece of mainstream entertainment, when it attempts to systematically raise true to life awareness on top of telling this tale on top of dealing with this meagre character content. There is an uncomfortable sense of the South Africans being there - they are easy targets, and the film will win fans cheaply in this regard.Of all people, a Joe Pesci character named Leo Getz is implemented into proceedings; a witness who needs protecting and who is assigned to Riggs and Murtagh's care but whose presence soon sees both of their paths more intrinsically linked than first appears. Leo is good value for a while, but is misused; Pesci has played characters who have had a tendency to dominated dialogue driven scenes, but always as the intimidator &#x96; if we're going to watch a film in which mismatched men acting like kids jabber on and on uncontrollably, either have Pesci do it to a much sinister-a degree or sideline him for the central pairing, because Getz's presence quickly wears thin. The plot about the Afrikaan cartel is nonsense, but of course it is; much like the techniques used by the best cops around when they consistently leave Getz by himself and no one bothers to guard Murtagh's house in spite of the fact he's already been hit there once by the enemy. With an uneven tone made possible by scenes of terrific violence and terror lined up beside more light hearted and more throwaway moments, not to mention a cackling chief villain at the centre of it whose reoccurring line is the roaringly amusing ......dip-lur-mat-ic immu-ni-tie! said in that way only a South African could, Lethal Weapon 2 is the sequel to the film that was clinging on by its fingernail for a recommendation in the first place, and of which doesn't work.

The only guy who got the Afrikaans accent right was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that i disliked was when Danny Glover so artlessly describes an Afrikaans accent as being shitty! I mean what a slap in the face to the Afrikaans. There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. I mean Mel Gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their P.A. type!

In addition, if you're not able to take the second sequel of a buddy cop action movie in the Lethal Weapon series, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) is one of the greatest action films of all time! Mel Gibson's performance as sergeant Martin Riggs is fantastic as well. This is a great must see movie! Martin Riggs becomes a bad ass in this movie, when his woman is killed. And also the movie gives more back story on how Riggs wife died from the first movie. I love this sequel but I have always enjoyed Lethal Weapon 3 much more than I did have enjoyed this one, but still a good awesome flick. I an a lot of opinions it is better than 3 & 4. It is my third favorite sequel in Lethal Weapon trilogy and I have enjoy Lethal Weapon 3 much more than I did 2. I love this sequel the same that I love 1 and 3, but 2 is one grade lover for me than 1 & 3. In the year of the Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 brought back Riggs and Murtaugh for the summer of '89. Man what a jammed packed summer that was. Lethal Weapon 2 lost it's darker tone but amped up the action elements and tossed in Joe Pesci (who was lost in cinema oblivion) until his turn in this movie, plus my cousin Vinny and eventually Home Alone and Goodfellas. His performance as Leo Getz introduces the comic relief that would go on through the next two movies. Lethal Weapon 2 offers up a fun ride with old friends an deeps the trust we have with Mel and Danny. They truly make a great cinematic team. Lethal Weapon 2 is the second installment in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover returns as Detectives Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, who find themselves assigned to protect an accountant (Joe Pesci) whose testimony involves a large money laundering conspiracy that involves South African diplomats during the time of apartheid. Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Patsy Kensit, Joss Ackland, Jenette Goldstein, Derrick O'Connor and Dean Norris did a terrific outstanding job portraying their characters. In the first movie there were drug smugglers, former Vietnam vets of a Shadow Company, this time they are South African diplomats who are smuggling drugs, weapons and gold coins from South Africa. I love the opening scenes that are in the middle of a car chase through the 4th Street tunnel in downtown Los Angeles. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), partners in the LAPD's homicide division, are in pursuit of a red BMW, while their colleagues are converging on the car from the opposite direction. It's a suspected drug bust. Riggs kicks it open and hundreds of South African krugerrands (gold coins which were illegal in the U.S. at the time due to the South African apartheid government), come spilling out. Murtaugh and Riggs head for the docks in search of the cargo ship, the Alba Varden. Murtaugh tells Riggs that it's scheduled to sail for South Africa. They find the ship and see three men standing near a container waiting to be loaded onto the ship. They ambush the men and take their weapons, then break into the container to investigate. Inside, they find Rudd's Mercedes sedan and numerous pallets piled high in shrink wrapped United States currency, in multiple denominations. The last showdown in the docks on the ship was pure action scenes and action sequences. The gun play was delivered with a lot of weapons. There was a lot of action scenes. (At one point Riggs fires his Beretta 92FS at an attacking helicopter and kills one of the henchman's.) Riggs (Mel Gibson) fires back at Rudd's henchmen atop his mobile home with a Heckler & Koch MP5A3. I have enjoyed the second movie a lot and the action sequences I still love this movie, I always love watching it and I just love all Lethal Weapons movies. I am giving this movie a 9 tough I gave Lethal Weapon 1 & 3 a 10, this movie deserves a 9, because I didn't like the scene It's just been revoked! Closeup of Murtaugh's Smith & Wesson Model 19 the moment before Murtaugh fires on Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland)in the head, when his gun was empty and the guy shows his South African diplomatic I.D. I don't like that scene and I think what Murtaugh did was just wrong in my opinion I am sorry. I am wondering what happened too Patsy Kensit? I have never seen her any other film role or on any other movie anymore.

Like the original, this is an over-the-top, cartoony cop thriller with ludicrous James Bond-isms. You have to accept the outrageousness in order to enjoy it, just as you do with the Bond flicks and similar cop thrillers, like 1977's The Gauntlet, although the latter's superior IMHO, as are the Dirty Harry films. While some aspects are predictable, there are a couple original and impressive parts, like the toilet sequence and the money-explosion scene. The film also scores pretty well on the babe front with Kensit and Goldstein, plus a couple others.

The second has the cops in a tight knit, their banter brushing off each other with satisfying effects. Murtaugh is still angry, and Riggs is still crazy, just less suicidal. They're the cop duo others try to replicate. LW2 carries over LW's best bits, while adding extra bonuses for all to revel in. Newcomer Joe Pesci ('I'm Leo Getz, and whatever you want, Leo gets.') is great but does grate, repeating 'ok' so many times I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The only drawback to LW2 is too much time and effort's spent on character development, as the South African criminals they face have no personalities. This is made up for by a shocking twist involving a key character's past.

I've seen so many bad action films that it becomes hard to decipher what makes an excellent one but I feel that 'Lethal Weapon 2' should be studied as an example. It has all the ingredients I think are essential to making a good action film. The movie most importantly has incredible loud action sequences that have weight because they aren't mired in computer effects or post production trickery and have stunt performers. It also isn't fearful in indulging in violence without being gratuitous. It isn't realistic and there's theatricality but it's not at the two extremes of cartoony blood or PG-13 action fast cuts when someone gets shot. It has grit and blood but it's also so alive with great characters.Most importantly are the characters and the acting. This film solves the problem of the first film in having memorable villains. The whole South Africa apartheid villainy is played for all the hate you can project on these goofy characters. Joss Ackland is so delightful. His performance masterfully skates at being just campy enough to get all the smiles you can without going into the ridiculous. But of course the bulk of the praise must go to the leads. Glover and Gibson are so charismatic and likable that the scenes where they drive to the shoot outs are still highly entertaining. I had a ball revisiting this one.

The action is still just as good, and there is still plenty to enjoy about Lethal Weapon 2.Lethal Weapon 2 wastes no time getting started as we see LAPD Detectives Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) in the middle of a police pursuit through the streets of Los Angeles with an unidentified suspect driving a red BMW which turns out to be transporting a trunk full of gold Krugerrands. There is an illegal smuggling operation which is being spearheaded by South African consul-general Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland) and his chief enforcer Pieter Vorstedt (Derrick O' Connor) however they are blatantly doing so while hiding behind the fact they have Diplomatic Immunity. Captain Harris (Steve Kahan) assigns Riggs and Murtaugh to babysit the irritating, obnoxious and overeager Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a federal witness who is going to testify against the South African smuggling operation. Riggs also finds himself a love interest, Rika Van Den Haas (Patsy Kensit) who is also Rudd's secretary at the South African Consulate. Rudd and Vorstedt continue to deceitfully continue their smuggling operation while hiding their diplomatic credentials and Riggs and Murtaugh vow to take them down.Lethal Weapon 2 adds a lighter comedic element with the introduction of Joe Pesci as Leo Getz. It's hard to believe upon seeing Leo Getz that Joe Pesci would later net himself an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as the volatile Tommy De Vito in Goodfellas (1990). Here in Lethal Weapon 2, Pesci's Leo Getz is nothing more than an irritating annoyance but enhances the comic relief to counterbalance the violent action scenes.It was great to see Mel Gibson and Danny Glover continue their dynamic partnership as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. Lethal Weapon 2 is a perfect example of a sequel that continues the story and introduces more elements rather than rehashing the story from the first movie. Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor were excellent as the chief villains of the movie. Patsy Kensit adds sex appeal as the beautiful Rika Van Den Haas who finds herself caught up in the war between the LAPD and the South African criminals.Keep an eye out for Dean Norris (TV's Breaking Bad), Jeanette Goldstein (Terminator 2 Judgment Day) and Mark Rolston (The Departed) in small roles.Director Richard Donner has continued to weave his magic as a director and has struck box office gold with the success of Lethal Weapon 2 as one of the biggest movies of 1989.What can you say about Lethal Weapon 2?

Despite the film's anti-South African stance, it was passed uncut by the South African censors and became a major financial success in that country. .The films' writer, Shane Black, walked away from this sequel after he decided to kill off the character of Martin Riggs. Warner Brothers disagreed with that decision, and he left the project.The body count is 33, the highest of the 'Lethal Weapon' series. During production, Richard Donner was shocked when Mel Gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for breakfast. Despite his alcohol problems, Gibson was known for his professionalism and punctuality. In the original script, the South Africans were even more vicious. At one point, they even torture Riggs in much the same manner as Mr. Joshua in the original. Its a Strong and funny sequel but if went with original ending would be even more classic.Still its one of the finest examples of the genre its a Kick ass sequel by concentrating on the often frustrating, funny relationship between the three men, the film gains in humour but loses some of the momentum and panache which distinguished the original.Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Richard Donner have all stated that this is their favourite film of the Lethal Weapon series.

But here one aspect overpowers the other. They go from noir pair of detectives to a comedic duo. This is underscored in a dozen small ways through the film. Laurel and Hardy on TV. Riggs 'performing' with the straightjacket for an audience of coworkers. The Leo Getz character so we can have lots of slapstick between them. Indicative of this shift is that Gibson is now a friendly kook around the house, part of the family. It makes sense, his wife's death was still fresh in the first.

His dance with Riggs at the end is movie magic.We would be remiss if we did not mention the incredibly luscious Patsy Kensit as Rika, Rudd's secretary, who only wants to stay in America.

As you might know I have a review for each of the 4 films where I rank them throughout they're review. So lets get started shall we? Lethal Weapon 2 could have easily been my favorite if not for some scenes which I don't like and which really could have been replaced by other, cooler scenes. The film is definitely the most overrated of the series, number 4 was better than this as well as number 3. This film is very good near the end when Martin Riggs goes out for revenge, I mean, I still like the film in a way but when I have to rank these films its probably my least favorite. But yes, this film should have gotten a 6.4 or something making it one point below the 4th installment. And thus concludes my review on the second Lethal Weapon film and the worst of the bunch.

As 80s action flicks go, this is definitely one of the best for spectacular vehicular chaos, ballistic mayhem, random acts of death and destruction, and tuneless music.Jeffrey Boam's script delivers on all counts, matching Shane Black's original in terms of wit, pathos, and excitement, and although it does introduce what would become one of the most irritating characters in cinematic history&#x97;fast talking money launderer Leo Getz (Joe Pesci)&#x97;at least Boam has the good sense to inflict a lot of pain and suffering on the guy in the process, Leo getting more than a few bruises as the story progresses.Seasoned Hollywood director Richard Donner handles proceedings well, balancing the light-hearted moments and the gritty action just right (a trick he seems to have forgotten come part 3), and with the benefit of a bigger budget than before, he gets to pull off some truly impressive action scenes, including the amazing destruction of an entire house on stilts.Part 2 also benefits immensely from a pair of memorable villains&#x97;South African diplomat Arjen Rudd, played by Joss Ackland, and his truly wicked henchman/assassin Pieter (Derrick O'Connor), and the welcome presence of the wooden but still very lovely Patsy Kensit, who very kindly strips off for a sex scene (the price we must pay for that pleasure is yet another Mel Gibson ass shot, but at least it's only a side view&#x97; not a full on crack shot like in the first film!).

Lethal Weapon III was really bad, though this movie is a little more enjoyable. The plot is clear and clichÃ©d, though it does have a little twist. The bad guys are simple drug lords (if there is such a thing as a simply drug lord, though that does tend to be the case in Hollywood movies) making millions from drugs. The catch is that they work for the South African consulate and are hiding behind their diplomatic immunity.This movie opens with a car chase through the streets of Los Angeles, though the chase I don't think is a gripping as some that I have seen. It has lots of explosions and machine gun fights, violence, action, death, and the humour of two cops that seem to go really well together. The overall action of the movie though is not all that great and does not drag me back to it. I remember when I first saw it, I loved it but soon got sick of it.Lethal Weapon II introduces Leo Getz who plays a more major role in the next two movies, though Gibson's love interest is not Rene Ruso, but rather a consulate worker who is killed. The purpose of this is because they obviously don't want to bring her into the next movie yet create Gibson's character as one who will not dump one woman for another.All in all this is a typically average movie. I remember that when it came out it created a lot of interest but in the end it is quite dull and I think will pass easily away, if it has not done so already.

It pretty much follows/sets up the template that we've seen played out over and over again, more recently in the likes of the RUSH HOUR trilogy. Gibson is the crazy one, Glover is straight-laced, and together they have to team up to bring down a gang of criminal nasties.Watching this film for the first time in many years, I was surprised by how fresh and inventive it felt. The comedy comes thick and fast with Glover's hapless ageing cop acting as the brunt of many of the jokes. As much as I like Glover here, the film really belongs to Gibson, whose crazed persona adds endless vitality to the movie. It never feels like he's acting, more like inhabiting the role.The ham acting of the performers playing the South African villains (headlined by Joss Diplomatic immunity! Ackland) is a cheesy delight and the film follows the template of including one great over-the-top set-piece after another (the toilet bomb is a highlight, I think). Things culminate in a finale that's dramatically satisfying to the nth degree, although of course with a film series this successful it wasn't long before a third movie came along.

The recipe doesn't evolve a lot nervous and dynamic action sequences mixed with comedy. The criminal case is always thin, anorexic but courageously puts the spotlight on the late racist state politic of Apartheid. The big feature here is the add-on of Pesci who plays a very talkative but sympathetic crook. The family life begins well with the episode of the advertising but it's a pity that the family disappears in the middle of the movie (and notice that since the beginning, the mother Darlene Love has never left the kitchen!). Kensit is a good pick for Mel's interest but it was useless to kill her, all the more that they shot an the alternative ending with her character still alive. In the same vein, it was stupid to mix Mel's deceased wife. In conclusion, it's a good movie but with sometimes clumsy spots.

You're Dead), the stilt house, the helicopter attack on the beach, the car in the storage container. And it does deliver on the promise of more explosions, car chases and shootouts. It's that skew towards the comedic that hampers this. Riggs and Murtaugh are more Odd Couple than oil-and- water, and for most of the movie's running time, it's all about the jokes. On the bright side, there is Joe Pesci, and he's hilarious. But it's in the third act when things get really dark and the movie bears the teeth that made the original so great. Things get serious, our heroes run headlong into a deathwish, and the score's going to be settled one way or another. Riggs and Murtaugh are two guys that, even though they've been through hell, and probably won't make it out alive in the end, still charge in to take the bad guys down anyway. This is my favorite aspect of this series. And even though it'll never again be this good, it's still the part that makes me return and sit through the comedy.6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Good action","Date":"17 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" What a hard action movie/sequel this is. I had heard nothing very positive about this movie until right before I saw it. I sat down, watched it directly after I watched Lethal Weapon, and realized just how great of a sequel it really is. It's not repetitive -- it continues the character progression and friendship seen at the end of Lethal Weapon, while at the same time adding a bit more humor than the first film.One of the things I praise about the first Lethal Weapon movie is that the characters didn't just suddenly agree to like each other at the end of the movie like so many films. They gradually learned to trust each other throughout the film, adding a sense of true friendship and realism to the film. In Lethal Weapon 2, the friendship between Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh is definitely expanded more to the point where they're best buddies. Most of the time when there is a sequel to a cop-buddy film, the directors and writers are afraid to continue the friendship. They seem to forget the end of the original film, and in the second film the characters hate each other again and the progress of friendship starts all over again. (As seen in such films as Another 48 Hrs.) But Lethal Weapon 2 is brave -- it isn't afraid to continue the story. I think that might be part of what makes it such a great, well-rounded series. It never really repeats itself, it always seems eager to move forward and ignore the past. The first film was a humorous, hard cop-buddy film about two opposites learning to trust each other. The second movie is a continuation of their friendship. The third film is almost a full-out comedy. And the fourth film is a tribute to the first three. Darn good film-making here.Lethal Weapon 2 is quite possibly one of the best sequels of all time. It avoids repetitions, it avoids cop-buddy clichÃ©s, and when it all comes down to it, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are such an amazing trio, that even if this film did follow the routine procedures I'd still love it. And you can't say that about many movies.

I would have thought that a good thing...","Date":"23 July 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" I think the director of the Lethal Weapon series Richard Donner coined the phrase 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Even if that is not the case it is definitely his personal motto.Lethal Weapon 2 is a very efficient replica of the original, so much so that I am willing to grant it Great status even though precious little has changed. Lethal Weapon 2 might be the same as the first, but when they are both equally entertaining you can forgive that, and this film might have the same ratio of action to comedy but here the jokes are funnier and more of them hit the mark.After Lethal Weapon 2 opens with a kick-ass car chase that serves to both get the adrenalin pumping, and reminds us that Riggs (Mel Gibson) is the crazy one and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) the more staid one who is 'too old for this sh*t and about to retire... still.We learn quickly that the new foe are a nasty South African crime group with management in high places, and half the things said or seen in the early stages serve as omens for the final 40 minutes or so.The boys are also given another task in this film and have to babysit a diminutive, motor-mouthed money launderer named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who has luck would have it has ties with the very same South African gang that Riggs and Murtaugh are after. Leo's OK, OK, OK jabber is amusing and annoying in equal proportion, so thankfully Leo gets more a bit part than a supporting role.All Lethal Weapons have great setpieces and action sequences, but this film is remembered for three things- The exploding toilet scene - DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY! - Mel and hottie South African secretary Rika getting' it onnnnnn.The fact that South Africa was right in the middle of apartheid when this film was released added a new wrinkle for the pair, obviously Roger, and made shooting white people cool again.Of course both Riggs and Murtaugh get their own personal nemesis to deal with and everyone nearly dies multiple times, but only those with less than 4 lines of dialogue actually bite the dust.Lethal Weapon 2 shouldn't work but thanks to the chemistry between the two leads, the efficiency of the action and the just right blend of action and comedy, you'll go a long way before you see a sequel as good as Lethal Weapon 2.Final Rating - 8.5 / 10. I didn't want to label this as Great but it's just so damn fast paced, funny and entertaining that I had no alternative.

He's an accountant who has figured out a foolproof way to launder vast quantities of illegal drug money. He's very funny and is great to watch in every scene he is in.What Riggs and Murtaugh stumble over is a complex plot, never quite explained, by which South African diplomats are dealing illegally in gold and other contraband. It is unclear exactly what their plan is, but they are ruthless in its execution. The action has Murtaugh in the bathroom about to sit up when he finds out if he does a bomb will go off. That scene has Gibson and Glover with their most chemistry. It's pretty funny and dramatic. Also Gibson's trailer being shot up by a helicopter as he escapes is cool. And some pretty good chase sequences.Richard Donner returns as director as he will do in further installments. The only thing I miss is the Mel Gibson being suicidal. I know he really can't be but it was a pretty interesting thing in the first. And for a period of time in the middle Danny Glover is no where to be found and it focuses on Gibson's character. But in all this is darker than the first and with the introduction of Leo Getz this is a really good movie.3 1/2 stars (out of 4) "},{"Title":"Return of Gibson and Glover bogged down in the Afrikaans","Date":"24 December 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Even though Lethal Weapon 2 is a must see film, it doesn't come close to the breathtaking originality and raw entertainment of the original. This is almost certainly because Mel Gibson and Danny Glover nailed their roles so well in the first movie, that the impact during another outing is diluted somewhat. We now know that Glover is the warm, respected family man whilst Gibson is the loose cannon who will shoot first and ask questions later. It is perhaps a mark of the success of the original that the sequel doesn't quite paper over the cracks of the set pieces that stretch credibility - we've seen it all before, basically. That said, this is still an entertaining movie. Patsy Kensit is a puzzling piece of casting that plays our Mel's love interest, whilst the choice of villain this time, equally strangely, are the South Africans. Given the imminent demise of the Cold War at the time, it was a strange choice, but this in turn gives the movie an easy target of apartheid - especially with the scenes when Glover's character is abused. This sequel also went much more for comedy - and again strangely Joe Pesci is bought in to ramp up the comedic value. Not an automatic first choice for a comedy part, but Pesci does deliver admirably well, even though his character becomes more than a little irritating by the end. Good movie, well worth watching, but not a patch on the original of course.

It was also a period where the buddy cop genre growth with 48 Hours and the Beverly Hills Cop Series. Sequels too were becoming more popular, such as the Back to the Future trilogy, Mad Max series, the Karate Kid series and Indiana Jones trilogy being major examples. With Lethal Weapon being a hit in 1987 a sequel was commissioned, with Richard Donner, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Shane Black returning.Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are now friends and partners in the LAPD. There are on the case of foreign drug dealers importing heroin into the United States. But when Murtaugh and his wife are threaten their captain assign the two officers to protect Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a loudmouth money launderer who has become a federal witness. Getz is targeted by the drug dealers Riggs and Murtaugh are thrust into action to arrest them. But there are South African diplomats lead by Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland). There are protected by diplomatic immunity so our heroes have to come up with other means to stop the cartel.With the characters established in the first film, Donner was able to jump into the action straight and what better way is then a car chase in the middle of Los Andreas. Lethal Weapon 2 was also able to streamline the plot, forcing mostly on the battle of minds and weapons with the South Africans. There are not as many subplots, but the ones that are in the film do work. Donner keeps Lethal Weapon 2 going at a face pace, with plenty of action and tone wise the sequel is more light hearted and overtly humorous to it's predecessor. Most of the humour works, like when Murtaugh goes to the South African consulate pretended he wanted to emigrate to the Apartheid nation. There is also a running joke about Murtaugh's wife's new car repeatedly getting damaged because of the police wok. But there are a few scenes which try to be funny but do not add anything to the film, like when the cops and Getz argue about going through a drive through. Donner continues using traditional techniques for the action sequences, using stunt work and keeping the action real. It is also so good to actually see what is going on during a shoot-out or fight. The final fight scene between Gibson and Derrick O'Connor was better in this film then it was in Lethal Weapon because Donner used a lot of wide shots and used less cuts in the fight. Donner and his writers also find some interesting ways to kill people in rather humorous ways.Acting wise Lethal Weapon 2 was alright, Gibson and Glover has good chemistry together and now much more light hearted. Most of the other actors did a decent job, but Pesci's character was very annoying and he works best with Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Some of the actors playing South Africans were also not able to master the accent, sounding more Australian/New Zealander, but that's a minor problem.However, a minor plothole in the film is if South African security forces started to kill American cops then you could imagine the response of the American government would have been.I found it very ironic that Gibson made fun of the South Africans for thinking there are the master race and calling one of them Adolf, considering we all now know his views on Black and Jewish people, women and homosexuals.A fun film.

I hadn't seen the original but you absolutely don't need to; this incredibly stand-alone sequel tells you everything you need to know about the two leads, Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) in the very first 15 seconds.I was absolutely blown away from the get-go and planted at the edge of my seat in the theatre the entire screening. Now, 21 years later and probably that many, or more, viewings, I'm still on the edge of my seat with excitement and awe in this fantastic film. In fact, this recent time I watched it, all the magic (SEE Movie Poster) was back and I couldn't help but clap in the closing on how much fun I had for the 21st time watching it.A lot of films advertise the multiple number of improvements in sequels in reference to the # in the series. For example, 2x The Action, Three times the Suspense, etc. This one, if I recall, did that obligatory 2x times the action, 2x the comedy, 2x the fun, or something like that. Though I liked the original Lethal Weapon, this did take everything to the next level. In fact, they elevated the magnitude of all that was right in the first one not by 2 but by ten.Though Pesci (Leo Getz) is a great and comedic addition to the gang (though no matter how many times I've seen this, I still can't follow his laundering money speech) with such classic lines like They F**K you at the drive-thru. *Repeat*, nothing beats the original members. Gibson is on top of his career as the rejuvenated lethal weapon from the first installment and Glover just goes along beautifully for the ride. You can sincerely see both having a blast, as if when they're laughing on screen and Director Donner yells cut, they continue rolling in laughter.The boys are back in L.A., this time researching the mysterious cougarans and the racist South African diplomatic immunity protected baddies while babysitting a state witness, Getz. The three cause city-wide chaos, uncover a mystery left open in the first Lethal Weapon and Riggs getz some. No, not with Pesci.Throw in some political statements (SAVE THE DOLPHINS!) which I literally hate when I see them either obviously or subliminally inserted in this series, and that's it. Really.I've heard that they had some rough outline of the script and the Director let the actors mostly improvise. So be it; this movie was hilarious, action-packed, deep, well paced, starts with a bang and ends on a justifiably tearful note. From beginning to climax, it's just one incredible scene after another and the writer/director knew enough when to give us a break, but not for too long &#x96; just enough to get ready for more excitement/humor.Oh, and the score's great, the soundtrack's wonderful George Harrison's Cheer Down, The Beach Boys's Still Cruisin' (After All These Years) and Eric Clapton's Knockin' On Heaven's Door are three of my all time favorites for movie music, the acting and even the over-the-top at times action sequences are believable and the lines were classic. 21 years later, I find myself quoting this movie, and most people I speak them to, know exactly what I am referring to, or can finish it for me. Such as the They F**K you&#x85; and my friends will fill in the &#x85;at the drive-thru! or Whatever Leo wants&#x85; &#x85;Leo Getz. Get it? This is a MUST-SEE for any fans of the action-comedy and is the ultimate buddy-cop film. Two decades later, it holds up beautifully today as if it were just made.Side Note Later in 1989, or perhaps in early 1990, I only owned three videocassettes that I watched over and over and over, well, because they were the only three I had. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Lethal Weapon 2 were my very first two, followed closely by Batman. So, I did watch and rewatch the second installment of Lethal Weapon multiple times, even without seeing the first until years later. Heck, I don't think I saw part one until after the third one came out in theatres. I was a tad bit disappointed in the original, only in reference to seeing all the action and comedy of part two whereas the first was more of a serious take on the lethal weapon Riggs. Nevertheless, part one's still good, but&#x85;Lethal Weapon 2 is a classic.Side Note 2 The only other times that comes to mind where the first installment is really good and the follow-up sequel tops in spades Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II and Aliens.

What does not square is the ending, and it is left up to the viewer to draw his/her conclusions. Lots of blood, guts, and killing going on for you viewers thirsty for action. At one point during the film, the bad guys appear to have declared war on the police department. The diplomatic aspect of the film is quite interesting, though it is never played up to full effect. The racial aspect has an edge on it as well...in those days there were dis-investments in S Africa by businesses and institutions of conscience, and the racists in S Africa were definitely feeling the heat, which led to its eventual downfall. Not all whites in S Africa are of a racist bent, nor do they fit the profile...but government policies had the same effect as rain...rain falls on everyone there, the fair-minded S Africans a well as the racists. But the movie itself is not a political statement. It is just action packed entertainment.

In the first film, they gave each other a new lease on life (more for Mr. Gibson, of course). Here, Mr. Glover does not seem as retirement-oriented; and, the once suicidal Gibson seems practically happy-go-lucky. The duo is asked to watch over money-laundering Joe Pesci (as Leo Getz), who is planning to squeal. Unfortunately, Mr. Pesci comes with some really mean South African drug-runners. They want to kill the Los Angeles police department employing Gibson and Glover.Director Richard Donner moves it excitingly, with a lot of violence and a little sex. This time shirt-shedding Gibson gets to mate with a pretty blonde, Eighth Wonder singer Patsy Kensit (as Rika van den Haas). Gibson thinks it's Rika Haagen-Dazs and gets her shirt off, too. You have to admit, they both have cute nipples. Also, Glover's pretty daughter Traci Wolfe (as Rianne Murtaugh) does a condom commercial which, Pesci says, Makes me wanna buy rubbers. Gibson cuts down on his drinking and smoking, and learns to get out of a straight-jacket like Houdini, which comes in handy, as you'll see. Glover gets a big toilet joke.Too bad filmmakers couldn't find a way to bring back the tremendously effective Mitchell Ryan and Gary Busey from the first film; but, replacement team Joss Ackland (as Arjen Rudd) and henchman Derrick O'Connor (as Pieter Vorstedt) make you miss the original villains less. The soundtrack is very nicely done, with The Beatles' George Harrison, The Beach Boys, and Eric Clapton contributing original material. Still Cruisin' was released as the accompanying single, but stiffed at #93 on the Hot 100 chart. Mr. Harrison's tuneful Cheer Down (heard over the closing credits) wasn't a single, but became a #7 radio Track hit.This, the Director's Cut of the movie has, Over four specially added minutes, according to the DVD notes, which are described as Riggs wows the pretties at a hotel spa before getting to Getz. Murtaugh receives bad bodywork news from an auto repairman after his beleaguered station wagon sees some Riggs-piloted street action. Plus, feisty Leo shares a newly included scene in which he recalls a suspect's address by complex spins of numbers that, well, no one can tell it like Leo.

And this second instalment is still a fun ride!The acting is nothing short of excellent. Especially Mel Gibson portrays the deeply disturbed Martin Riggs with great finesse and his ability to create nuanced characters shines through in this movie. You genuinely feel with him and feel the incredible weight of his wife's death on him. Danny Glover is also great in his role as the aging family father. The on-screen chemistry between the two actors is excellent and the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh has been weighed more heavily than in the following movies that were to come.The action in the movie is excellent for an 80s movie. All in all, a movie where basically everything works and is perhaps underrated by the voters of IMDb. "},{"Title":"A thrilling and often humorous sequel","Date":"30 July 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Lethal Weapon, a successful action blockbuster from 1987 starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, spawned a total of three sequels. This one, Lethal Weapon 2, released in 1989, was obviously the first of those three. I saw the original Lethal Weapon for the first time just three months ago. I was less than a year old when that one was released, and just under three years old when this first sequel came into theatres. Since they're R-rated movies, I obviously wouldn't be seeing them anytime soon. I was unaware of the existence of the entire series until sometime within the past couple years. However, as I expected, I was impressed with the first one when I saw it this year. I wasn't expecting this one to be as good, but still had reasonable expectations, and wasn't disappointed.As Sergeant Martin Riggs and Sergeant Roger Murtaugh of the L.A.P.D. chase after a criminal in a red BMW, it crashes. They go to arrest the driver, but find out he has escaped. Riggs and Murtaugh search the car, and discover that the trunk is filled with Krugerrands, South African gold coins! After Murtaugh is threatened in his bedroom by a group of South African thugs, who warn him to stop the investigation, the two L.A.P.D. officers are assigned to protect Leo Getz, a witness in a drug case who will soon testify! They learn that this man has been doing business with South African drug smugglers, a group lead by Arjen Rudd! Rudd is the one Riggs and Murtaugh are after, but unfortunately, he is the minister of diplomatic affairs for the South African Consulate! He and his organization are diplomatically immune, meaning it will be hard to arrest them! Like the original, Lethal Weapon 2 features a good amount of action, suspense, and humour. The film starts off humorously with the car chase, showing the two main characters with a very different attitude towards it. After that, a lot more humour follows, with Riggs and Murtaugh's awkward relationship. Joe Pesci plays the goofy Leo Getz, a comical character who also amused me. I laughed quite a bit during the film, and also found myself in suspense many times, with the two heroes in pursuit of the dangerous criminals! The part with Murtaugh stuck on a booby-trapped toilet is good for both suspense AND laughs. The two stars, Gibson and Glover, made a good pair in the original 1987 blockbuster, and do it once again here. This sequel may not be quite as consistent as its predecessor, but at least it comes close. The biggest problem I have with this second installment is that it seemed a tad overlong to me, but apart from that, there's not much I can complain about.

Unlike most people, I generally like sequels. This film is no exception. The things that made the first movie a success made this film a success. There is still plenty of action and comedy mixed in with each other.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are back as butt-whooping cops. This time around, they must protect Leo Getz, a talkative con businessman. Before they do much, they get into trouble with the South African people.The acting once again is splendid. Gibson and Glover have great chemistry. It's not everyday when you see old guys play successful bad guys. This certainly did me in.Overall, this is a great sequel. I liked everything about this film. My favorite scenes involves Rianne and commercials. I rate this film 9/10.

While Riggs was an ambivalent and unhinged guy in the first part, he's more like the Australian answer to Bruce Lee and James Bond rolled into one here (hordes of villains keep attacking him with nuclear weapons -- Riggs wards them all off with his trusty Beretta and the occasional roundhouse kick) -- which unfortunately also makes him a lot less intriguing.I would really have preferred a less ludicrous and more together plot. I thought it was a nice touch to throw in a bit of current politics and to give the South Africans (then still a racist rÃ©gime) a hard time, but the movie goes way over the top here in painting them Blofeld-evil and likening them to the Nazis. It's just silly and schematic. Riggs repeatedly busts this one fat South African guy murdering babies and stuffing them with drugs, to which the insidious Kaffir-hater will always retort by claiming diplomatic immunity.Overall, this franchise lingers under the he usual weakness of the plot and narration department, but is still often enjoyable. It's one of those movies which is fun to watch, then afterwards there is this uncomfortable phase where you unsuccessfully try to make sense of the plot, and then you forget the whole movie quite quickly. "},{"Title":"More explosive and dramatic than the original","Date":"19 December 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Danny Glover and Mel Gibson as cops Murtaugh and Riggs had enough chemistry in 1987's Lethal Weapon to generate more than four times the film's estimated budget that it easily green-lit a sequel. Lethal Weapon 2 gives us further development of that relationship, but what you didn't necessarily expect was that the story and the action in the sequel would improve too. Well, Richard Donner and Joel Silver bring the heat once again in this sequel. It's just as witty and clever as the original and even more stuff explodes. The action even takes a turn from cool to serious as the bad guys (members of the South African consulate who use their diplomatic immunity to cover up their crimes) seem to be everywhere and taking everyone's life. You really don't like them at all. The film also deepens the humanity of Murtaugh and Riggs (specifically Riggs in this one) at the same time, which is pretty admirable for an action script back in the 1980s.The gunfire does get excessive at times and much like the original there's some crazy new scene unfolding around every corner with little lead in, but by some point in this film you just accept that as part of the Lethal Weapon universe--the bad guys are everywhere and there's always something going on. It really allows the film to pack in as much action as possible.Donner in the director's chair also deserves more accolades this time around. He simply gets how to weave action and drama by focusing on the characters a lot while also capturing the scope of the action sequences.Glover and Gibson really are a great tandem. They are both untypical for action heroes because they have such a wide range of emotions. They both joke around, take their jobs seriously at times, can be filled with hate or revenge and they truly know what's most important to them. Too many cops in films are one or two-dimensional but Shane Black's characters are not.Perhaps the only thing wrong with the film, other than it's odd racial undertones in tackling Apartheid South Africa, is that it forced writer Shane Black to walk away based on where Silver and Donner wanted to take their blooming franchise. Hard to argue with a gross more than double that of the original though.

They seem to have the upper hand in taking down Rudd's gang until they realize one very menacing thing about Rudd and his gang...they have diplomatic immunity and cannot be arrested.Like the first Lethal Weapon, the enemy is an evil gang with its super-evil leader, and its clear cut who the enemy is. What's different is the methods they use and the action/fighting scenes. Also here, there is a new member of the gang, the hunted, klutzy Leo Getz (Joe Pesci).I feel this movie's action scenes were great, but the character development wasn't as good as the first. Also, a few scenes could have been done better, but I won't complain all that much as Lethal Weapon 2 is not a movie to be messed with.8/10 "}{"Title":"South African input","Date":"27 December 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" I liked the movie and did not want it to be tarnished by incorrect understanding of the foreign words used.The Afrikaans phrase jou moer comes from moeder which means mother (it is also an old word for baarmoeder which means womb). It vaguely refers to the concept of your mother but is seldom used as the c-word. It is used in a slightly crude but funny and fairly well accepted sense in South Africa.For example moer big means a mother of a size. And if you moer someone, you give them a mother of a beating. Jou moer is not directly translatable but means something similar to screw you or your ass!. (Jou means your, not you in this case). It's only perhaps if you say Your mother's moer! (if you really corner the word), that you indirectly probably referring to a meaning that it is not usually used for.The truth is no-one knows what it really means anymore, but it's nice to say and a versatile adjective, adverb or verb. It is used by young and old alike, in colloquial conversation, but it would be improper to use it in formal situations.Just a point of interest the South African actors are unlikely to be real South Africans - judging by their accent. We roll our R's to begin with ,and even English South Africans know how to say moer properly - it is a short, abrasive word, not like in the movie. But they must have had some South African input none the less.The movie was quite popular in South Africa as Afrikaans seldom features in Hollywood films, let alone slang Afrikaans. So it was fun to watch. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were a good choice of actors and delivered well. The racial tension issues did not detract from the main storyline - to get the bad guys.

In terms of action movie franchises, Lethal Weapon is second only to the Bond movies.    Like the Bond series, the Lethal series began with a serious, violent thriller and evolved into spectacular action blockbusters with plenty of humour. Unilke Bond, however, the Lethal series got better with every installment, reaching a peak with 1992's Lethal 3, before returning one last time for a not-quite-as-good final installment in 1998.    So, Lethal 2 is better than the original, not as good as Lethal 3 and about on par with Lethal 4. What does that mean in real terms? Well, it's very violent, intense action of the eighties rather than the more stunt-based, spectacular action of the nineties. It mainly consists of machine gun shoot-outs and bloody fist fights, like the original, but already begins to move away from the seriousness of Lethal 1 by creating more elaborate, unlikely deaths for the villains that are therefore less exploitative and less nasty. Unfortunely, there are almost no really memorable action scenes in Lethal 2 apart from Riggs' Raiders of the Lost Ark-style attempt to take control of a truck whilst in motion. The final shoot-out is so cliched and unimaginative it beggars belief almost. Isn't the &#145;rule' that the good guys have to  fight the bad guys pyhsically at the climax? Not just shoot them? Riggs does get to kick ass, but it's bullets over fists here.  Still, very enjoyable stuff with great characters. And that's far more important than action anyway, isn't it?

Humor is one element that is taken to a higher degree in this film, and it is an effective tool in moving the film along, where as in the first, suicide contemplation and other dramatic scenes served a similar function.The film however, could not have succeeded without heinous villains, and despite the fact that their activities are never explained, the South African diplomat/criminals serve as formidable adversaries.Lethal Weapon 2 does of course require the viewer to have seen the first film in order to fully understand the characters and certain references, but still, as a companion piece to LW1, or as its' own film, LW2 is solid entertainment.

It's good that Riggs has grown out of his semi-suicidal state which largely drove him in the first film (since at the very least, he's now got a friend and a defacto family with Murtaugh). But what we're given to replace that feels really cheap and manipulative.What I really didn't like was creating motivation for Riggs by conveniently having him drop his new girlfriend back at her flat for the bad guys to kidnap, and the oh-so-convenient revelation that the same bad guys sadistically killed his former wife (previously thought to be a car accident). Plus killing off the new girlfriend - OK, that's a bit novel since the girl doesn't get saved this time around, but then again it's just used as a way to motivate Riggs (and probably clear the way for a new female in the next movie).Regarding the villains, with the warming relations between Russian and the US, plus the fact the Ruski's had been done to death as movie antagonists, sooner or later racist South Africans were going to be a logical choice as bad guys for this kind of flick (and for what it's worth, I don't believe this film portrays all white South Africans are racist - Patsy Kensit's character is obviously intended to provide some balance on that point). But actually, why stop with using the villains' nasty character as an *excuse* to blow them away? My suggestion.....involve a victim of these guys who is *in South Africa*, and use that as the motivation for Riggs, rather than continuously putting his family/partners/families at risk. Ambitious maybe, but then again, so was the first film, making the hero a guy who quite possibly wasn't mentally stable at all. This sequel defaulted to standard 'good guy must be damaged by bad guys personally in order to kill and blow stuff up' clichÃ©s.

I found it to be watchable and fairly enjoyable, but it wasn't what I would call 'fantastic'. In this second film, there were a number of problems which (for me) made this film merely 'average'. The opening 10-15 minutes were great and I really thought I was in for an exciting sequel, but after this opening sequence the film just seems to plod along and fails to keep up the momentum.For me, I just didn't find the plot of this film to be particularly engaging; South African diplomats using their immunity to engage in criminal activities. The leader of the South African diplomats is Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland)- whilst Ackland's acting was fairly good, I found him to be a fairly forgettable villain. There was also a distinct lack of character development in this second film. In this second film, we are introduced to Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who is a witness which Riggs and Murtagh are assigned to 'protect' before he testifies at a trial. However, complications ensue when it turns out that Getz has been dealing with the South African diplomats and confesses to stealing a large amount of cash from them.In addition to the rather weak plot, I also found a few implausible scenarios (Riggs managed to pull a building down with his truck, Riggs managing to shoot a villain in a helicopter from long range in the pitch black). The first film was a bit silly, but this film felt ridiculous at times rather than silly.The good thing about this second film is that the chemistry was still good between Riggs and Murtagh. I also felt that Leo Getz was a great addition to the film (although he was clearly introduced more for comic relief than anything else). Pesci is a great actor, but I felt that the writers let him down here as his character's dialogue was repetitive and at times it did get a bit tedious.This is a tough one for me as all the ingredients from the first film are there; humour, good chemistry between the leads. However, it's let down by a weak plot and at times I felt somewhat bored (which is not something that I can say about the first film). To sum up, Lethal Weapon isn't a complete disaster, but it's definitely not as good as the first film.

Those parts really made me feel good and smile. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent, suspenseful, funny, and action-packed thrill ride to all you Mel Gibson or Danny Glover who have not seen it.

Two years later the cops are back for more ass-kicking and blowing up the bad guys than before where there is more than meets the eye.Riggs and Murtaugh just finish chasing down a couple of bad guys where they noticed that there's a load of stolen money before realizing its from drug traffic. The subplot involves a ruthless villain played by Joss Ackland who's pretending to be a diplomat for South Africa where they could do their crime in Los Angeles; there's also a witness that both Riggs and Murtaugh look after by the name of Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who can't seem to shut the hell up at any cost. Leo's a witness to bringing down the fake diplomat whereas Riggs discovers that one of the criminals wanting to kill him, Murtaugh and Leo has ties to his wife's death.Lethal Weapon 2 still proves to be a wham, bam, thank you ma'am movie where it feels like between the action, the relationship of the characters and the talking, this sequel proves to outshine most sequels.

Reprising their 'good cop, mad cop' routine, except with a greater emphasis on the lighter side of Riggs's character, the comedy is enhanced further by the significant adaptation to the series of pint-sized motor-mouth Leo, played by Joe Pesci (Raging Bull). Along with the full set of characters introduced in the original, such as the police chief, the psychiatrist, and Murtagh's family, we are treated to an even greater range of gun fights, car chases, explosive fist fights, and dramatic confrontations as the duo become involved in an investigation into heroin smuggling.The bad guys, who are depicted as stereotypical Afrikaner racists (boo, hiss), are nevertheless played by deliciously by Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor, who spit out their dialogue in as guttural and vicious way as possible, accentuating the unusual use of the South African accent (in Hollywood, anyway) to create characters immediately identifiable as villains, but whom it can be great to imitate anyway! The actual 'plot' of the drug runners hiding behind diplomatic immunity takes third place to the other two plot strands, as the police come under attack for their intrusion and Leo enters the new treble act with Riggs and Murtagh.Visually, LETHAL WEAPON 2 will always go down as the most memorable of the series, mostly due to the famous 'bathroom scene', which should be textbook material for any writer in how to take a unique dramatic situation, and turn it on its head to create comedy. In effect, that is the entire LETHAL series in a nutshell. We do get another long hard look at the dark side of Martin Riggs, and once again Gibson is completely believable as a man driven to the edge of rationality by his enemies, as he makes a terrible discovery about the death of his wife. Also notable for the appearance of the stunningly beautiful Patsy Kensit who does a great job keeping up with Gibson (why she married Liam Gallagher I can't imagine), the first sequel to LETHAL WEAPON is a worthy successor and in some regards actually succeeds in surpassing its illustrious predecessor.

A sequel to the great action flick was a must!!  Unfortunately the first sequel is not everything it should have been, and in some aspects it was too much of some things.  Joe Pesci being the too much.  The story line seemed jumbled and hard to follow.  Diplomats from South Africa are hiding behind their diplomatic immunity in order to carry out a drug smuggling organization and some other things that are forgettable or too hard to figure out to remember.  Gibson and Glover are nonetheless perfect as Riggs and Murtaugh.  The two best friends and partners are closer than ever and on their toes.  Unfortunately they don't have a lot to work with when it comes to the bad storyline.  Joe Pesci is brought into the mix as a witness that they have to protect from the diplomats who are also money laundering or some fool thing.  The movie starts out promising with action packed scene in grand Richard Donner tradition.  The comedy in the film between Riggs and Murtaugh, their one liners, and bantering between the two of them is hilarious and perfect, but all of a sudden completely unnecessary Joe Pesci comes in and he is just too much...he is definately the Jar Jar Binks of Lethel Weapon.  He is barely funny and is just slapstick comedy that doesn't sit right in the movie.  The bad guys are not scary and we don't hate them, in fact, they are forgettable and easily defeated.  Riggs also finds himself falling in love again with a beautiful diplomat working for the bad guys.  She doesn't like her boss and she hates what he's in to and eventually he becomes her demise in a very touching scene.  The romance is very good, and we feel for Riggs losing another lover.  Riggs also discovers that one of the men working for this bad guy is the man who killed his wife...which is an interesting and a good storyline but it's handled very poorly.  Riggs doesn't get the kind of revenge that perhaps we would like to see him get against his wife's and his new lover's killer. The movie was also chock full of bad language that is completely misplaced and annoying...it's gratuitous.  As well the body count rises as Riggs and Murtaugh kills everyone in their path which is TOO unrealistic and borders on crazy.  Even certain explosions and car accidents would have killed civilians but that is never mentioned either.  Usually in an action film this is overlooked but there is just sooooooo much of it that you can't miss that fact of it.  Overall it's a sequel that falls very short of the amazing original.  However, it's a must see just because of Gibson and Glover and it's part of this wonderful action series.  I have given it harsh words but it entertained me and despite the negatives it's not bad.  I give it a 7/10...which falls far from my review of the original.

Still crazy, but no longer suicidal, Riggs (Gibson) continues to hunt down the bad guys with partner Roger Murtaugh (Glover), and this time around they find their lives in danger when they get too close to the underhanded dealings of South African Arjen `Aryan' Rudd (Joss Ackland) and his band of thugs.  Along the way, they're assigned to baby-sit an informant in a money laundering racket, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci); and Riggs at last finds someone, Rika Van Den Haas (Patsy Kensit), who helps ease the pain of his wife's death, while also discovering who was responsible for the automobile accident that took her life. 	As he did with the first `Lethal Weapon,' Donner keeps it all moving along at a brisk pace, though he allows the intensity level to drop somewhat this time while infusing more humor.  There's some `Stooges' on hand, and a bit that finds Murtaugh the target of some office gags after the debut of a television commercial, starring his daughter, Rianne (Traci Wolfe), for a product that takes him by surprise, but the real laughs come courtesy of Pesci, who's upbeat, manic characterization of Getz becomes a real scene stealer.  Though serious at the core, this movie is more of a joy ride than the first, though there are moments of true menace and apprehension, as well as a sobering resolution involving one of the featured characters. 	Performance wise, Gibson is as charismatic as ever, by now settling comfortably into Riggs' skin while further exploring the more intricate details of the character's personality.  Glover, too, manages to take Murtaugh to the next level, leaving no doubt as to who this guy is and what he's about, from his dedication to the job, to his even more stringent dedication to his family.  And, most importantly, these two really click as a team, and Donner knows just how to bring out the best in them.  What really raises the bar in this second installment, however, is the addition of Pesci, who makes Leo Getz a truly memorable character.  Inserting him into the mix was a real stroke of genius, and Donner wisely uses him just enough to effectively lighten the mood and counteract the drama. 	The supporting cast includes Darlene Love (Trish), Derrick O'Connor (Adolph), Steve Kahan (Capt. Murphy), Mark Rolston (Hans) and Jenette Goldstein (Officer Meagan Shapiro).  With snappy dialogue, plenty of action and some good guys to root for, `Lethal Weapon 2' is a thoroughly entertaining sequel that more than does justice to the original.  Donner knows his territory, and his stars know their stuff and how to deliver it, and that's a `lethal' combination any way you look at it.  And what's even more gratifying, is knowing that they didn't stop here; after all the action of the first two, you know there's another one waiting for you.  At this point, do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars; `Lethal Weapon 3' is available, and it's yours for the asking.  I rate this one 9/10.

Stuck with nothing much to do, they decide to investigate the criminals Leo is testifying against-a rude lot of Soud Av-ree-gan diplomats with immunity to commit as many crimes as they want. Riggs also takes a fancy to their secretary Rika (Patsy Kensit), but obviously their romance isn't going to last. She might as well have a death-clock counting down on her forehead.Richard Donner seems more involved in making LW2 a better film than the original. This time he shoots in Panavision (why he didn't do this first time around I don't know), allows more time for character development and tries hard to make a political message out of the South African Apartheid situation. Even in his previous film Scrooged, which came out a year earlier, he had anti-apartheid messages. And, if you're really sad like me, you'll notice that Riggs and Rika bang their heads together when they first meet in the exact same way that Frank Cross and Claire Phillips do in Scrooged. And his then pro-NRA posters are still hanging around in the background. Donner later reversed his opinion on this organisation.I always felt that the original Lethal Weapon was far too plain and straight-forward. It lacked spark in every way, but LW2 introduces more characters, has more sophisticated action and a better plot. Michael Kamen however pretty much cuts and pastes his score from the first and even rips-off his own Die Hard score in a couple of cues. This got worse in LW3.The ending could have killed the series off had Riggs died, which is what Shane Black originally intended. We would have been spared the awful LW3 had this been so. But instead Riggs manages to fight off death and stay alive in Murtaughs arms despite being shot about 86 times. A nice touch having Bob Dylan's Knockin' On Heaven's Door playing over his potential last moments alive though.After this the series became too comical and diluted. They SHOULD have killed him.

Lethal Weapon II starts out immediately with a car chase, starting off what is to be a very entertaining film. Murtaugh and Riggs have the same personalities that they had before, and as is to be expected, they worked excellently on screen. Roger is the family man again, having major crises over the fact that his coming-of-age daughter has landed a spot in a condoms commercial (which he is teased about for the remainder of the movie), and Riggs is still the hyperactive cop with a few screws loose. Riggs now reveals that he has a talent for popping his shoulder in and out of its socket, one of the elements of the film that worked well as far as helping the story along, but that is just ridiculous in reference to real life situations. If you were wondering if a person could pop a dislocated shoulder back into place, painfully or otherwise, by smacking it on a wall or on the side of a car, I can pretty much assure you that it just doesn't work that way. It was funny to watch though, wasn't it?This is the installment where we are introduced to Leo Getz (played hilariously by Joe Pesci), who is the anxious but mostly unwelcome addition to Riggs' and Murtaugh's partnership. I think that they overloaded his mistreatment just a little too much for the film, Leo seemed to take entirely too much from Riggs and Murtaugh to keep cooperating with them. Nevertheless, this was still a great action film. In a memorable scene in Roger's bathroom involving a toilet bomb, he and Riggs are even able to successfully display an emotionally charged scene, even for this type of fast paced action film (in which almost any type of emotional involvement is usually clumsily thrown in to attract a larger audience (females) in true Jerry Bruckheimer form). And they even manage to jerk a few tears near the end in regards to Riggs' stunningly beautiful new girlfriend.As has become tradition in the Lethal Weapon series, there has to be at least one scene where just as the &#145;normal' police arrive, Riggs is staggering away from the destruction of a flaming crime scene breathlessly saying that everything is under control. This is done and overdone in the entire series, and it never seems to get tiring. The gunfights are great, the chases are better, and the action overall is excellently done by Richard Donner for the second time, but there were some things that just should have been left out or changed completely. For example, the helicopter shootout scene at Riggs' `house' was a little too excessive. It was too hard to believe that he and his girlfriend could have dodged THAT many bullets. It was cool to watch, but there's no way they could have avoided getting hit at least once. Also, I refuse to believe that ANY pick-up truck could have pulled the stilts out from under a house like it was done in the film. That was just too much. Even if some super-powerful pickup was ever able to do that, there's no way it could have gotten out of the way of the falling structure fast enough to avoid getting crushed by it.However, despite such disturbing weaknesses as these, Lethal Weapon II was a great movie. The things I mentioned above were badly unrealistic, and probably couldn't even be pulled off by a professional stunt team, but they worked really well with the story. The shootout scene with the helicopters created some good tension, regardless of how unrealistic it was. Also, with the kind of people who were in that house, you WANT to see the foundation pulled out from under them, and having Riggs do it not only fits perfectly with his personality, and it also almost makes you want to get up and cheer for him. This is a very good action film. It is virtually non-stop action from the opening scene, and it has a good ending, which is in my opinion one of the most important parts of any kind of movie. A bad ending can cancel out an otherwise good movie, and Lethal Weapon II is good from beginning to end. Excellent show.

Mel Gibson returns as Martin Riggs and he is fired up and seems to keep going despite obstacles. His partner, played by Danny Glover is attacked in his home along with his wife by masked assailants. There is a tie here to what happened Riggs and his departed wife. Glover springs some humour when his daughter's big acting break comes within a condom commercial prompting ribbing at work. Joe Pesci is also quite comically engaging as a witness they are assigned to protect. Pesci is loud and obnoxious yet seemingly likable. Patsy Kensit plays the secretary to the film's villain. She hates her job and becomes the next romantic interest to Riggs but one cannot help but dislike the handling of this character, especially given the already dreaded past of Riggs. The villains have all the life of a store window mannequin with laughable thugs with shampoo looking long hair that seems fresh out of a commercial.

The dynamic duo this time is up against South Africans and we get to see the tie in between how Riggs wife died and the films subplot. The score as usual was just efficient, reason why efficient is the word is that it is just perfect, the jazz vibe just adds to the fun and makes the film grand.This action comedy was released two years after the first and the leads Danny Glover and Mel Gibson reprised their roles as Murtaugh and Riggs respectively. The movie's plot is very insightful and the lines were timely. The introduction of Joe Pesci (Academy Award winner for Best Supporting actor in Goodfellas 1990) was all that this movie needed to make it the best out of all the four in the film series, he introduced some laughs and he had a more prominent role in this film than he did in the other two.The movie plot is about this two Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) against a South African diplomat who was using his immunity to carry out criminal activities. While they were on the case they met Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who also crossed the South African.The movie is very intense, we get to see both parties in tight corners and this time Riggs was the one that had to experience a personal attack on his home. This flick was the most brutal of the four from my own view and some of the police officers cast in the first film were killed off.The movie was a critical success and it has the highest approval rating of all the four films, and the movie was also a commercial success. Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Richard Donner have all stated that this is their favorite film of the Lethal Weapon series and we get to see Riggs dislocate his shoulders twice which later became a regular in the film series.After this film Richard Donner who also directed the first went ahead to do two more and Leo Getz was also a part of the remaining two films.Word is out that a Lethal Weapon 5 will be done soon and two new leads will be employed to come take up the role of Roger and Martin, I just hope they can live up to the standard that this two has set.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"Not only it's great, but it's almost greater than the first ...","Date":"25 September 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Just when you thought you had enough to make an anthology book, the film starts with one hell of a car chase sequence, catching you totally off-guard, and another one with an unforgettable conclusion, -although a bit gruesome, but take my word that the bad guy 'had it coming'. Just when you thought no explosion would ever surprise you, Lethal Weapon 2 is remembered as the one where Murtaugh is trapped with a bomb in his toilet, although I found the explosive diving board more shocking and disturbing.When you thought you had 'good' bad guys in the first, wait until you meet the villains in Lethal Weapon 2, the mastermind is Arjen Rudd, the ministry of affairs for the South African consulate, played by Joss Ackland and his hit-man, the slimy and evil Vorstedt (Derrick O'Connor). To give you a glimpse of their level of evilness, not only they belong to the government that was practicing segregation (the apartheid still existed in 1989) but they use their diplomatic immunity as a bullet-proof vest to cover some cold-blooded killings, among other malevolent actions.You have villains who not only kill but can't get killed and if I said that Hans Gruber from Die Hard was slightly superior to Mr. Joshua, it's like the writers finally understood that vileness could be scarier, more effective and more infuriating when it uses the appearance of respectability, like when you have a bunch of LAPD officers pointing their guns at them, on the verge of a successful arrest, and then are forced to leave. The comparison with Nazis through the 'Master Race' insult is a historical shortcut but not necessarily irrelevant regarding the context, but the film cleverly avoids a blind Manichaeism by inserting the character of Rika, a young South-African secretary who doesn't approve everything from her country.And through Rika, it's two birds hit by one stone, because she and Riggs fall in love, and trust the script that it's not a romantic subplot for the sake of it. Everything has a purpose in Lethal Weapon 2 and serves as a build-up for a final confrontation that would be ten times more spectacular, thrilling, violent and emotionally driven than the first opus. And we all know how a formulaic or conventional climax can ruin even the greatest action films. I remember I gave a positive review for Commando but the climax of Lethal Weapon 2 would almost make me reconsider my opinion. Anyway, the writers know that the more you'll hate the bad guys, the more you'll cheer at their demise.And it works indeed. Martin Riggs will be enraged as he's never been and Murtaugh himself, who plays the good cop, or the too-old-for-this attitude, can't let the bad guys get away with some crimes they committed. Well, let's just summarize the whole film, otherwise, I would end up spoiling it, the script makes the final confrontation personal, so personal than the last bullet shot and the line that accompanies it is the perfect pay-off to all the little bits that angered us. And although it's an overused line, the 'this time, it's personal' never resonates as something cheesy and forced. We're so engaged with Riggs and Murtaugh, that we share their laughs and joys as much as their sadness and fury.Besides, personal is a word I like when it comes to the Lethal Weapon series because the action, as spectacular as it always is, never distracts from the motives, from what goes through Riggs and Murtaugh's hearts and minds, and the plot's center of gravity their relationships. In Lethal Weapon, they had to know each other to get along, in Lethal Weapon 2, they're inseparable and even their constant disagreement is the cement of their complicity. The toilet-bomb scene manages to distract us from the comical aspect of Murtaugh's position through some genuine interaction. At one point, Murtaugh, wants to say something to Riggs, no word is spoken but Riggs understands, and so do we, that's friendship at its best and we understand them because in a way, they also became our friends.Naturally, we find Riggs and Murtaugh in their opposite lifestyles, Murtaugh's family has grown up and one of the film's running gags concern a condom ad where Rihanne acted, Riggs still live in a trailer in the beach with his dog, Sam, he still loves the Three Stooges. The power of a sequel is to create newness with old material, but Lethal Weapon 2 doesn't take it for granted, yes there is some Riggs and Murtaugh of the first opus in the opening car chase, but it would have been tiresome had it lasted the whole film. Lethal Weapon 2 didn't recycle the same kind of interactions for different situations but rather featured different interactions for similar situations, and the strike of genius from the writers is the insertion of Joe Pesci's character Leo Getz, a crooked accountant who blew the whistle about his client's money-laundering activities.Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect him, and then the duo becomes trio. Pesci plays a small, loudmouthed, annoying character, punctuating his sentences with so many OK OK OK OK the only answer you want to give him is Shut up! along with some pinching and slapping. But far from being a simple comic relief, Leo consolidates the two characters' interaction by giving them a same target and happens to be indirectly linked to the bad guys, so in his own way irritating way, he's so significant that it's impossible to imagine the film, let alone the franchise, without him.It's obvious to me that Lethal Weapon 2 captures the magic of the original film with such efficiency it would less qualify as a sequel than as a continuation of the level of greatness initiated by the first, and I'm not even exaggerating because whatever made Lethal Weapon memorable is twice as great in the second opus.

Only in the last 20 minutes does Riggs recapture the edge to his character that I thrive on when I watch the original. I like Joss Ackland as an actor and he's a steely villain but he's not particularly threatening - the film treats his death almost like an afterthought; plus the addition of a 'lovable comedy sidekick' further dilutes the tension in a way that I don't think was necessary. Mel Gibson is funny enough as Riggs on his own, someone else to make us laugh wasn't needed, I felt.On the plus side, Derrick O'connor almost singlehandedly restores the menace as henchman Vorstedt, who for me is easily the best baddie of the entire series. He has a great climactic fight with Riggs which is appropriately brutal. Watching it makes me nostalgic for the days when our hero knew how to handle himself in a scrap even with a knife in the leg, and didn't get his behind handed to him by Jet Li... *sigh*There are some great individual scenes that definitely still make this worth watching, but as a sequel I prefer the third entry, where the elements of the story seem to fit better and everything doesn't feel quite so fragmented.

Gibson and Glover continue the adventure of two cops doing what they do best. Lethal Weapon 2 gives sequels a better name.Buddy-cops Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh are back, trying to keep a key witness and themselves alive. Murtaugh is still the rock solid family man. Riggs is still the reckless daredevil, but now he counts the odds before bucking them. Lethal Weapon 2 is fun, exciting and will take your breath away.To say that the cast of Lethal Weapon 2 is better is an understatement.  Regulars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover kept their special onscreen relationship going on, though their cop instincts are a little bit different. Enter funny man Joe Pesci. He plays Leo Getz, a pip-squeak and a nuisance. Director Richard Donner said in relation to Pesci, With Mel and Danny, Joe is the third stooge and I have to agree. Pesci starred as the bad guy in the 90's classics 'Home Alone 1 and 2' with child star Macaulay Culkin. I remember he was very funny in those films. The leading female in Lethal Weapon 2 is Patsy Kensit, with that gorgeous accent and cute face she was great as Rika van den Haas. Her love scenes with Rigg's were a nice touch and calmed down the movie for a small time. The bad guys are heartless in Lethal Weapon 2. Joss Ackland was the South African Ambassador Arjen Rudd, who knew he could not be touched. I remember Ackland from the Original Mighty Ducks film, he wasn't nice in that either. Likewise Derrick O'Connor, played the henchman of Rudd's and was very cruel and callous in his job. Bad guys are important in these cop movies, the wrong choice and it can hurt your film. Lethal Weapon 2 has some incredible scenes. Again the start is terrific. The funniest scene would have to be at the start of the film, when Murtaugh's daughter (played by Traci Wolfe) starts her TV advertising career. I love the reaction of Murtaugh after the commercial, and the line She makes me wanna buy rubbers!. When Riggs and Murtaugh first meet Leo Getz it's great, with Leo and Martin crashing through a motel window, just amazing. Then the craziest scene to be thought up in my time of movie viewing would have to be when Roger is booby trapped on his toilet. This is hilarious when the Fire Brigade, Bomb Squad and Police Department are involved in helping this guy off the dunny, and Murtaugh claims I'm gunna die on the toilet aren't I? Again the end of this film is extremely good, with tension, passion and action that left me dumb-founded. This movie also has some great stunts in it. Nothing is better than the scene where Riggs chases after one of the bad guys, clinging for his life. Getting the chance to look behind the scenes really allows you to appreciate how much is involved in bringing us this kind of movie. The other scenes with great stunts would have to be at Rigg's beach house, flying helicopters and shooting the good guys would have been difficult to do. Plus the destruction of the chic hillside stilt house would have taken weeks of careful planing and was great to watch. Credit for this part of Lethal Weapon 2 needs to go Charlie Picerni. Credit again must go to Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner. His precise and charismatic direction, took me on one wild roller-coaster ride. He is truly a great director, with an inventive mind and very humorous touch. So overall, Lethal Weapon 2 didn't seem like a sequel, in fact it had a very original feel to it. With creative stunts, a refreshed cast (including the silly Leo Getz) and funnier humour, Lethal Weapon 2 was brilliant. Plus I will never forget the image of the toilet hitting the Murtaugh's car, just priceless.

So, what makes this action movie so much better ? To begin with, it has Mel Gibson. This is one fine actor who shines in every role he plays , but the thing that makes him especially delightful to watch is the fact that he does not bother to be suave or eloquent in any manner,but chooses to play his act as he did the first time- that of the out-of-control,devil-may-care cop who doesn't bat an eyelid before shooting at the bad guys, and to hell with all the laws of the land. His version of the hero cop remains an original which has not been imitated by anybody till date. Probably because no one would be able to pull it off the way Gibson did! It is the first factor that makes the Lethal Weapon series the classic that it is. And then comes the Danny Glover factor. There has not been a more humane cop on the silver screen . He brilliantly portrays the warm , doting father who loves his job as much as he loves his family.When hew gets furious over the fact that his daughter is in a commercial for condoms, we not only laugh but also sympathize with him too. I do not think that any other actor shared the same chemistry with Gibson as Glover did.The rest of the cast are just sideshows, but one cannot overlook Joe Pesci. He is as humorous and lovable as he always is, and his inclusion in the plot makes for some very funny moments. And yes, who can forget the glamorous Patsy Kensit ? Her role is brief, but nonetheless,memorable. All things considered,this is one film that will remain a model for any director who wants to make an entertaining,absorbing action flick without CGI or doses of casual sex thrown in for good measure. It was made in 1989, but I feel that even today, it will be a great watch for any teenager who sees it for the first time. Director Richard Donner did a great job indeed, supported by a great cast.

At the end of the chase, they kick one of the suspect's cars and out comes South African money called the Kreugerrand. After I saw those foreign coins, this was the part that was going to make Lethal Weapon 2 much different than the original.Later, I realized that this drug gang, masked really as members of the Consulate of South Africa, are using their immunity from prosecution and arrest (since they are actually diplomatic agents) to commit drug-trafficking and its related crimes. I also saw some new details on Riggs' characterization. Realizing that he was involved with counterinsurgency tactics and martial arts in the original Lethal Weapon, I realize that he is also a die-hard Houdini fan, during a scene at the police headquarters where Riggs, already bound with a straitjacket, tries to free himself. He does free himself but he slams his shoulder right into the hard wall, on purpose!...With this absurd act, I realized something new in Riggs... in some cases, he loves being hurt (that is, he loves pain) in situations where other people don't want to be involved with being hurt.One of the most serious parts of the movie almost put an end to Murtaugh's life. The movie doesn't reveal it verbally, but the reason why Murtaugh was on a toilet rigged with a C4 explosive bobby-trap behind the toilet (which was ready to blow up if he got up) was that the drug dealers ignored his warning earlier in the movie to stay away from them because they are from the consulate. After bobby-trapping Murtaugh, the gang locked up the house so that Riggs could not get in. (This almost directly shows the type of sectarian violence under apartheid in South Africa around the 1980s.) But Riggs did get in by kicking down the front door. Riggs was the first one to find out that Martaugh was bobby-trapped, especially when he saw the phrase on the bathroom tissue, Boom! You're Dead! When Riggs called the bomb squad, I knew the Riggs and Murtaugh had their friendship on the line--big time! Their only saving grace, says the bomb squad, was to put LN2 (liquid nitrogen) on the device and for Riggs to pull Murtaugh into the tub since the tub would absorb most of the explosive impact.The narcotraffic gang's last straw was when Riggs' strongly befriended Rika Van Den Haas (played by Patsy Kensit)....and Arjen Rudd (the main bad guy in the movie) orders the gang on a bombing and assassination wave against all of the L.A. officers involved (for example, officer Collins blown away by a booby-trap explosive as she was going to dive into her swimming pool, or officer Wyler being shot in the head by a 9mm) in taking the drug dealers down. Murtaugh came close to his death himself against two of the gang members before he both knocked them out with a nail gun, but not until other assassins kidnap Leo Getz (played by Joe Pesci) and take away Murtaugh's car. At the same time, Riggs and Van den Haas both came close to their deaths by assassins using automatic weapons fire on the house trailer Riggs lived in the first Lethal Weapon movie. Fortunately, there is the same characterization in the previous Lethal Weapon movie--his strong black-bag skills in Vietnam stopped the police-killing assassins in their tracks...saving both him and Van den Haas. This part almost screams James Bond for Riggs but not exactly. This also reminds me of True Lies, where the protagonist and his love interest (of course, I am talking about Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger) are involved in shootouts with renegade terrorists also with automatic weapons.Patsy Kensit's acting role as Rika is almost like a Dutch version of Madonna....moreover, her character is considered very gentle, especially in her voice. She sounds like as if she should be a presidential candidate to appease the violence in South Africa. The only problem with her that she sometimes speaks too fast.

All the same elements were in place, cast, director and writers were all back for another slice of buddy buddy action bonanza. The only change of course is the villains, here represented by Joss Ackland & Derrick O'Connor's weasel South African bastardos. Joe Pesci enters the fray as the comical Leo Getz, a Federal Witness that the cop duo have to babysit till trial.Right from the off the tone of the film is set as our ears split and our eyes get dazzled by a high speed car chase. Riggs & Murtaugh are in hot pursuit whilst exchanging a now customary difference of opinion as regards police work. We know they are mates and we know that Riggs is still the lethal weapon and Murtaugh is old school copper. So whilst there's nothing new in that the formula remains the same, the makers do flesh out the relationship more as the film progresses. With one or two scenes absolute gold dust as the boys' lives come under serious threat. We are now, in spite of the carnage that surrounds them, involved with them, yes, such is the charm of their relationship, we care. It's good writing, regardless of the charges from some quarters that these film's are nasty shallow excuses for making money.It's fair to say that this is Gibson's movie, because it's written that way. Some of Riggs' back story is filled in and he even gets a love interest in the slender form of Patsy Kensit. Riggs cracks the jokes and does the outrageous mental stuff, while Glover's (still doing fine work in Gibson's shadow) Murtaugh continues to be the counter opposite. Tho some of the astute written sequences involving Murtaugh and the South African core of the story are excellently handled by Glover. But regardless of character development and nifty political observations, it's the action that dominates proceedings. Director Richard Donner has a wail of a time putting the cast thru their paces. There's explosions, fights, shoot-outs, more high speed pursuits, and on it goes till we get to the finale, a potential cliffhanger one too.Two more inferior sequels would follow, all of which still made serious money. But this serves notice of the last time that all the elements came together successfully.

It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful; excellent character development, imaginative direction, professional performances by the cast and crew, a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog, and action...lots of good fast-paced, well-delivered action. It had a fresh comedic element without ever turning to camp or juvenile antics to solicit a chuckle from us. The comedy was educated, intelligent and expertly-delivered. The characters were lovable, and we got the feeling that we knew them, cared about them, wanted them to succeed. Riggs's character felt less like a character and more like a person, due to the high-level of development his character received. True, the gun handling left a lot to be desired, but the vast majority of audiences would not realize that you can not get 20 shots from a 16 shot clip. Nor would they realize that you can't just leave those empty clips on the ground; they cost MONEY and no CoP would do that because law enforcement officers are typically not highly paid. That aside, this was an excellent movie with wonderful entertainment value. One of the best of its kind.2 - gave us Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz. Because of Getz, I honestly found this film to be rather endearing. Getz is one of the best characters to have been introduced to this series. Unfortunately, the edge and freshness is toned down way too much, and the action is really rather predictable. I thoroughly enjoyed bearing witness to the further development of the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh, and was not in the least bored with that aspect. It is still a good movie, even though its edge is shelved for a more marketable product.3 - is just as good as 2. Riggs now has a new love interest and it seems as though all will be well and all manner of things will be well. It is still a few months away from the press release concerning the Glover/Gibson signing for 4 & 5, so it seems the series has wound down, rather than up. The action is still quality, though there are fewer and fewer unpredictable moments. The comedic aspect which was enlightened and intelligent is now a bit puerile and tired. And while the performances are still professional, it seems as though Riggs and Murtaugh both are well on their way out.4 - is the perfect ending to this series. Honestly. The characters have developed as far as I can bear to witness; Murtaugh misfires his gun in the locker room of the precinct, Riggs gets his butt kicked by a rookie cop in the boxing ring, and Riggs and Murtaugh are both just too old for this action thing anymore. (Gods help us with 60-something-year-old Harrison Ford in the upcoming Indiana Jones 4.) Their CHARACTERS speak constantly of being too old, and I'm not talking about Murtaugh's well used line, I'm getting too old for this sh*t. It is far beyond that. And now, with Riggs's marriage to Lorna, Murtaugh's daughter's marriage to Butters, the new babies and all the smarmy crap at the ending...enough is just enough.5 - should never happen. I don't think I can bear to see anymore smarm from these two. The characters we all loved are already gone. Like in Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, they've been stolen from us. The edge from Riggs's character is gone. He's a bit hapless now, and sad rather than the lunatic mayhem we want and NEED from his character.The only way to pull off a 5th installment would be to kill off Lorna's character, the baby AND Butters. Either put Riggs back where his character was in 1 & 2, or don't bring him out of the moth balls. PLEASE. I loved these movies, but for the love of Mike! NO MORE!If you liked any of these movies, I highly recommend Tango & Cash, an excellent, much-overlooked, highly under-rated Buddy-Cop movie.1. 9.2/102. 8.8/103. 7.6/104. 6.8/10 from...the Fiend .

It also expanded the character's worlds and gave Martin Riggs a more-rounded sense of worth.I do long for more films like this from Silver, as later efforts like ROMEO MUST DIE and THE MATRIX, although technically virtuous, don't have the heart and soul of the earlier films.A smart move by Donner to put the focus of frustration of the two leads on Joe Pesci's Leo Getz character heightens the brilliance of the humour on show.Interestingly enough, the uncut version of this film was shown by mistake by UK's Channel Five station a few years ago which I spotted.

The duo are hot on the trail of a South African drugs cartel but efforts to arrest them prove fruitless as the criminals have diplomatic immunity from arrest in the US.&#145;Lethal Weapon 2' is in my opinion a worthy sequel to its predecessor and in some ways better. Enhancing the story from the original rather than trying to change it we are now confronted with a `lighter' Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). The strong friendship that has grown between the two is beautifully portrayed in a scene where Riggs puts his life on the line to save his buddy's Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). Although the scene in question is in some ways amusing the well constructed dialogue and the acting abilities of Glover and Gibson make it easily one of the most touching and suspenseful scenes in recent film history. Murtaugh's character remains the same as he tries to cope with the madness that Riggs always brings but you can tell that he is rapidly becoming accustomed to it and, to some extent, has even started to enjoy it. &#145;Lethal Weapon 2' succeeds primarily in the touching and emotional portrayal of the friendship of Riggs and Murtaugh so much so that the heart-wrenching final moments and final shot from Murtaugh's gun have so much more impact than one would expect.&#145;Lethal Weapon 2' also brings in a comedy element that the original did not have (and understandably so) in the form of Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, a witness for the state who laundered drug money that Murtaugh and Riggs were forced to protect. From the first moment these three people meet each other there are constant giggles but thankfully the jokes are a lot more restricted than they became later in the series. By &#145;Lethal Weapon 4' there were far too many jokes which distracted attention away from the action and storyline. Luckily, in &#145;Lethal Weapon 2'  the jokes were used to enhance the film and the main storyline as well as some explosive and thrilling action sequences were still the central focal point of the movie.From the exhilarating car chase that opens &#145;Lethal Weapon 2' to the battle that ends it there are plenty of well choreographed, directed and entertaining action sequences. The script for &#145;Lethal Weapon 2' is very strong, as it was for the original, which makes the whole movie have a feeling of leading up to something which is an excellent quality for a movie to have. I have already commented on the acting abilities of Gibson and Glover who were on top form for this picture but I feel I must also compliment Patsy Kensit for her somewhat short role as Rigg's love interest Rika and also Joss Ackland and Derrick O' Connor for their excellent performance as the leaders of the criminal gang.I certainly recommend this movie to action fans and any fans of the original. &#145;Lethal Weapon 2' delivers exhilarating action and adept performances complimented marvellously by great direction and a tight script.

An Absolute Classic.","Date":"1 June 2013","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Lethal Weapon 2 is one of the best Action films ever made and not only that it is one of the best sequels of all time. Filled with great direction,amazing cast,excellent action and a great score Lethal Weapon 2 is a true classic of the Action genre and is one of my favorite films.Set two years after the events of the first film,Lethal Weapon 2 brings back Riggs(Mel Gibson)and Murtaugh(Danny Glover)who now have to deal with South African diplomats who use their diplomatic immunity to do criminal activities. At the same time Riggs and Murtaugh have to watch and protect fast talking accountant Leo Getz(Joe Pesci) who used to work for the South Africans and is now testifying against them. Now Riggs and Murtaugh have to protect Leo and stop the South African diplomats once and for all.Lethal Weapon 2 a film that I have loved since I first saw it when I was a kid and was the film that introduced me to the Lethal Weapon films. Mel Gibson,Danny Glover and Richard Donner have always said that Lethal Weapon 2 has always been their favorite film of the the franchise and it has been my favorite film of the franchise because Lethal Weapon 2 takes the Action and brilliance of the first film and raises it higher giving viewers an intense,powerful and Action packed experience. One of the reasons I think that Lethal Weapon 2 is one of the best sequels of all time and one of the best Action films of all time is because LW2 while a sequel to the first film is different from the first in terms of story and execution where the Action is bigger and louder and much more violent than in the first film. LW2 is a also a great sequel because it works on it's own where it is not necessary to watch the first film because when you watch LW2 you are pulled in by the main characters and you know them as the film goes along. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam is well-written and filled with great dialog that matches Shane Black's great script in the first film. The Comedy and Humor in LW2 is funny and gives the film a much lighter tone than the first film because of the situations and dialog between the characters Riggs,Murtaugh and Leo a relationship that would go on in the other films and the Comedy and Humor is a great balance to the serious tone of this film. Most Action films during the 80s were known for having a political and social commentary and LW2 is no different with LW2 commenting on South Africa,Apartheid and racism and while the film isn't overly political there is enough social commentary that gives this film an edge. LW2 moves at a great and relentless pace and moves so fast that you barely have time to catch a breath or take a break because LW2 grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the end and that is one of the things I love about the film. Riggs,Murtaugh and Leo Getz are a great trio in this film and the rest of the series because the dialog and situations between the three is hilarious because the personalities are all different. Riggs is crazy and mad,Murtaugh is straight laced and logical while Leo Getz is fast talking and a loud mouth. Leo Getz is a great character because while he talks a lot and annoys Riggs and Murtaugh,Leo is smart and knows how to get things done and sometimes gets things done in a hilarious way. The South African villains in this film are classic villains in the LW series because of their vicious and cold hearted way of doing things and using their diplomatic immunity to do their illegal activities whether it is killing people or smuggling things into the United States. The South Africans are great foes for Riggs and Murtaugh. The Action and fight scenes in the film are brilliant and well-executed and are handled in a much bigger scale than in the first film and every Action scene is suspenseful and exciting and the Action scenes in this film are something you will never forget. The final 20-30 minutes are thrilling and Action packed and is a excellent conclusion that will have your eyes glued to the screen. A great ending to this amazing film.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are brilliant once again as Riggs and Murtaugh and once again have great chemistry. Joe Pesci is great and hilarious as Leo Getz,with Pesci having amazing chemistry with Gibson and Glover. Joss Ackland(Arjen Rudd) and Derrick O'Connor(Pieter Vorstedt)are menacing and fantastic as the South African villains. Patsy Kensit is great and beautiful as Rika,Riggs love interest who also works for Arjen. Steve Kahan(Capt. Murphy),Mary Ellen Trainor(Police Psychologist),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh)and Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh)give good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellent,with Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great energy and pace while also doing well with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is excellent and intense and fits the tone of this film. A great score by Clapton and Kamen. There is also a great song from George Harrison(Cheer Down)and a memorable use of the Bob Dylan classic Knockin' On Heaven's Door(covered by Eric Clapton,Randy Crawford and David Sandborn).In final word,if you love Action films or the Lethal Weapon series,I highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon 2,a classic Action film and sequel that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

There's also a small group of sequels that build on and so improve upon the original. Lethal Weapon 2 falls into a third category. It is neither better nor worse than the original. As Tommy Chong would say, it is basically the same thing, only different. Given that the original was a stunning example of how much better action films were when the MPAA had not yet decided that films had to be suitable only for children, this is certainly good enough for the discerning viewer.Lethal Weapon 2's principal difference from the original is that the lead character, Riggs, is played with a more light-hearted, even gentle tone for the most part. It is not until the final act, when the links with the original are properly resolved, that the angry, violent Riggs we saw in the original Lethal Weapon comes back to say hello. Unlike what happened in the latter two sequels, Lethal Weapon 2 does not take the lighter side of Riggs too far. Instead, Riggs is a very human character with more than two dimensions, a fact that was especially missed in Lethal Weapon 4. Even the introduction of a romantic interest, played with aplomb by Patsy Kensit, works wonderfully because of these all-important depths to Riggs' character.The biggest problem with Lethal Weapon 2 comes in the form of Joe Pesci. This is not so much Pesci's fault, as he is a very capable actor. The problem is that his character is as one-dimensional as most of those that populate the next two Lethal Weapons. By the time we are finished with his introduction, we are just about ready to feed him to a paper shredder. Fortunately, the acting skills of Danny Glover and Mel Gibson give Pesci something to bounce his rather flat material from. But the real surprise here is the quality of the antagonists.It is a well-known law in action films, or indeed many a genre, that your protagonist can only be as strong as your antagonist. Derrick O'Connor and Joss Ackland are two of the best antagonists that have been depicted on film. So much so that they manage to overcome the anti-apartheid message we are often beaten over the head with during much of the film. Director Richard Donner's tendency to push a political ideal in his films often works to the detriment of his films, so it is a testament to the strength of these two actors' performances that the film works so well. The viewer loves to hate them, and they truly seem to enjoy earning it.In all, I gave Lethal Weapon 2 a seven out of ten. It isn't the most brilliant film you will ever see, but it sustains multiple viewings quite well. And let's be honest here. Where else can you see men riding on the front of speeding cars or being killed with surfboards?

Don't hate me for it. I think they're all good. But the brainlessness of the films are easier to explain (and appreciate) if one sees them as action-comedies.#2 is a lot more entertaining than it's prequel, mainly becase the characters are already worked in and can go on with their business (shooting everything that looks suspicious and going on like a couple of cranky radio hosts) without the introduction. Riggs' suicidal tendencies have calmed a lot and he is easer to deal with (personally, not professionally), and Murtaugh has accepted his weird and violent new partner. The story, however, is kind of lame and feels a bit awkward at times - but the final showdown is very slick and cartoonish, and brings the film up to speed again.

That is, a concept of law which intimidatingly flaunts its own vulgarly intoxicating duty to bypass, not only the most legitimately overriding sense of personal debt, but also nothing less than the First Principle of the Nuremberg Tribunals!&#151;Right?&#151;or Wrong? Wrong!&#151;Right!&#151;and Right!&#151;But, this time, about as lightly as the Miranda concept is trivialized, as an opposing mirror image! . . . That is, at least until Due Process is just as questionably exchanged, even for a general's time to die; just as it had only thus been for a family member, grounded under punitive asylum; as if these allegedly opposing images lacked an operationally identical point of origin, obscured by eternal contrasts made manifestly relevant only after the fact, minus any optional way to die. . . . That is, as well as contrary to their own insufferably paternalistic insistence that the lesser substance by nature leads to the greater, but with the same Bad Faith behind their raving that sellers would be impossible without buyers, until the truth is ironically taken hostage, against even the most consistently incoherent incentive not to know. . . . Ordinarily, I'd have been much-too-negatively overwhelmed by the misleadingly pretentious duplicity of such a twistedly-discordant composite, were it not for the way even those more bitterly offensive elements had been Divinely grafted in; albeit with the aid of those who already have their reward, save for the very dismal fact that it has barely begun to be paid in full! . . . That is, as a reminder not to continue cursing our civilized heritage, even for let-alone through its grossest misinterpretations of just about every genuinely moral principle it even more self-indictingly knows so very well how to preach, and just as demandingly impose! . . . But, rather, let us mourn for it, as it continues, right to the very Razor's Edge of every rapidly-narrowing Shade of Gray, to demonstrate that its is the kind of Superlatively Idealistic Imagery which needs be just as artistically, compellingly subdued; via a few jolts of shock therapy which cut so anorexically thin that one is almost doomed to say&#151;Good Night! . . . Yes, right up to the closing cemetery scene, with its tenderly somber and solitarily meditative mood; which speaks so clearly of the love I'll always have for my own Victoria Lynn, and of a metamorphosis which just may succeed at putting me again in touch with my deepest feelings. . . . That is, contrary to an inner sense of emptiness which still projects only the illusion of her absence, as well as a very serious form of blindness which time cannot for very much longer afford to indulge&#151;before even its Diplomatic Immunity is fatally revoked--and involving the real meaning, here and now, of Ezekiel 2415-27!

Buddy movies and sequels were all the rage in the 80s, and this is amongst the best or the worst depending on which way your wind blows. Crazy Gary Busey and Patsy Klinesit also co-star with Crazy Joe Pesci in this crazy romp. Crazy cop Melanie Gibson goes off the rails when his wife is killed by drowning. He teams up once again with Danny Glove to get into action and kill all the water in the world. The problem is, Fanny Lover is also scared of water and keeps getting stuck on toilets so isn't much help. It turns out that Tyrannical (Saurus Rex!)Busey is a surfer who can send tidal waves at sunbathers. He has been steadily growing this power so that he can unleash a huge wave at San Fransico and kill everyone (when he was younger he was rejected by the flighty San Fran crowd for not being flamboyant enough). Rather than going for the logical solution and calling the coast guard or Superman's cousin Water (man) Mel Griffith and Danny Glick decide to take on the wet Bush meister themselves.This film ups you auntie from the first film, and is bigger, better, and not as good. There are plenty of quips and spark between all the cast members (in actual life they are all related to each other and grew up in the same house), and we have car chases, boat chases, surfy chasings, and lots of guns and bombs. This should all add up and equal a good film, but for some reason it doesn't. Maybe they forgot to carry the one. They seem to have done something like 3 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 10. Don't not do not get me wrong, right? Because it is still good, just not as good as it should have been. They would reach new highs with the third film, which is easily the worst of the Octology.Best Scene When Riggs and Barry are chasing Bushell in the water and he suddenly leaps out at them, yelling paranoid conspiracy theory rhetoric at them before sinking back into the gloomy depths. Gibson turns to his lover and delivers one of the great movie one-liners 'We might need a bigger boat!'

Whilst protecting federal witness Leo Getz and falling in love with Rika Van Den Haas the two must hunt down the criminals.This had a lot to follow and it doesn't succeed.  The plot is a little silly.  It tries to link to the first film in absurd ways and tries to stay fresh by bringing in Joe Pesci as comic relief.  The story relies on OTT action but lacks the rough edges of the first film - making it more of a fantasy action film.Gibson and Glover are OK but you can tell that they aren't totally convinced about what they're doing or who their characters are meant to be - Riggs is halfway between being a relaxed action hero and the madman of the first movie.  Pesci is funny and does manage to bring life to the film, however he is quite incidental and does get irritating.  Ackland is a poor bad guy and Kensit is pretty much a non-entity.Overall a disappointing follow-up to a solid action film. "}]
