[{"Title":"I am Dracula....I Bid You Welcome","Date":"2 May 2004","Score":"74 out of 80 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"   Dracula is a true cinematic classic that still hold up well today more than 70 years after its initial release. Bram Stoker's novel had been filmed before, most notably the 1922 German masterpiece Nosferatu with Max Schrenk playing the vampire as a monstrous rat like creature with no redeeming qualities. Bela Lugosi rose to instant fame with his portrayal of Dracula, a part he had been playing on stage for several years. Lugosi's interpretation is that of a suave and sophisticated nobleman with a hypnotic stare and a cultured Hungarian accent. This made the character more appealing to the ladies while at the same time terrifying to the audience when we see the monster revealed beneath. The story has the tragic Renfield (Dwight Frye) arriving in Transylvania to complete a transaction with the Count which will allow him to lease a English castle. Before they leave for England by ship, Dracula turns Renfield into a quasi-vampire who obeys his master's every command. Upon arriving in England it is discovered that all of the ship's crew have been murdered and only a raving lunatic of a Renfield remain alive. Renfield is committed to a sanitarium run by Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston). Dracula seeks him out and discovers Seward's comely daughter Mina (Helen Chandler) and her friend Lucy. Dracula quickly kills Lucy and sets his sights upon Mina whose fiance Jonathon Harker (David Manners) is baffled by her sudden change in health and personality. Seward consults with a colleague Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) who quickly identifies the source of the problem as a vampire. They soon expose Dracula for what he is and...... The atmospheric sets of this movie set the tone for the story. Dracula's castle is dark, damp and web filled and his cellar is positively scary. So too is his English manor with the classic winding stair case leading to the cellar. The opening theme I found to be equally foreboding and frightening. I wonder how many of those early film goers realized that it was adapted from the classic ballet Swan Lake. Bela Lugosi should have become a major star after this film, but did not. His first mistake was the turning down the role of the monster in Frankenstein (1931). He did enjoy moderate success in the first half of the 30s playing various mad scientists and criminal masterminds. But he also accepted roles in several poverty row quickies which did little to advance his career. He had a brief return to glory in 1939 when he played Ygor in The Son of Frankenstein and again in 1948 again as Dracula in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein. With his well documented personal demons, Lugosi wound up his career in cheap B' movies ultimately becoming the star in some of Ed Wood's classics. Oddly enough, though he was forever identified with the Dracula character, he only played him on screen twice, in 1931 and 1948 as noted. He did play Dracula like characters in MGM's Mark of the Vampire (1935) and in Columbia's Return of the Vampire (1943). Dwight Frye almost steals Dracula from Lugosi with his portrayal of Renfield. He takes him from a young ambitious businessman to a half crazed lunatic and back again. After this and his role of Fritz the hunchback in Frankenstein, this great character actor never again achieved such heights. A real tragedy. Oddly enough, Stoker's book portrays Renfield as a minor character and it is Jonathon Harker who makes the unfortunate trip to Transylvania. Also filmed in a Spanish language version.

Sure there may be a few campy scenes that look like they might be out of some high school play production (the rubber bats and armadillos in Dracula's castle come to mind), but there is an unmistakable suspense and eerieness about the film. If you are lucky enough to find the DVD reissue from 1999, you have three great versions the original 1931 version with basically no background music, the 1999 rescoring of the movie by composer Philip Glass, and the extremely interesting Spanish version, made at the same time as the original (with totally different actors).  If you have this DVD, watch the movie twice once with no soundtrack and once with the Glass rescoring.... totally different movie.  Glass' score is great, but it doesn't really help the movie at all (it actually hurts it in many cases).  But the utter silence in Browning's original just makes my skin crawl!  The acting is actually quite great (Lugosi is, of course, phenomenal as is Dwight Frye as Renfield).  The fear, the suspense, and, believe it or not, the sexuality, combines for a great movie that was an unbelievable success in its first release ($700,000 in it first US release, $1.2 million worldwide).  Not bad for a movie made 72 years ago!

Great Universal classic!","Date":"10 January 2004","Score":"46 out of 58 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Thinking back to 1931, it's hard to imagine what going to the movie theater was like for people. It was something new and exciting; instead of having 6 movies open in one weekend, they were lucky if 6 movies opened in one month. Horror movies were nothing new in 1931, but one's with sound were and Universal Studios cranked out hit after hit after hit, one of the first being was Dracula. Not too many people realize that these films created exactly what we think of the typecast today with the most popular monsters. Dracula, if you've read the book, is nothing like what Bela created the cape, the accent, the charm, the presence, the looks, etc. This was the first time we ever had a romantic Dracula, the silent film released before called Nosferatu was a monster, Bela created a Dracula that could charm you one second and the next he's draining the life out of you. Dracula is one of the most memorable movies of all time and it's not hard to see why when you watch it.Renfield, a British solicitor, travels to the Carpathian Mountains. He enters a castle welcomed by charming but odd nobleman Count Dracula, who unbeknownst to Renfield, is a vampire. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax Abbey in London, where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula's three wives suddenly appear and start to move toward Renfield to attack him, but Dracula waves them away, and he attacks Renfield himself. Aboard the Vesta, bound for England, Renfield has now become a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who is hidden in a coffin and gets out for feeding on the ship's crew. Some nights later at a London theater, Dracula meets Dr. Seward, who introduces his daughter Mina, her fianc√© John Harker, and the family friend Lucy Weston. Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula, and that night, after Lucy has a talk with Mina and falls asleep in bed, Dracula enters her room as a bat and feasts on her blood. She dies in an autopsy theater the next day after a string of transfusions, and two tiny marks on her throat are discovered. Later on Mina has the same bite marks and now the men call on Professor Van Helsing to take on Dracula and save Mina before she meets the same fate as Lucy.Despite the fact that it might not be as terrifying as it was back in the day, you have to consider that this movie made people faint in the theater and gave them nightmares for years to come. The film does have flaws, Lucy dies and that's it, she never comes back which was interesting that Mina was becoming a vampire when bitten, but Lucy doesn't. However, the atmosphere of the film still holds up incredibly well, Dracula's castle has the perfect shadows and isolation that could send shivers down anyone's spine. Makes you wonder how the heck Renfield could stay in that place? I would've camped outside, especially when Dracula comes down and says in that creepy voice I bid you welcome; would you trust someone like that while looking at your neck like it was a Thanksgiving turkey leg? Bela gave a terrific performance that will be remembered for all time. But also much credit to Dwight Frye who plays Renfield and still has one of the most horrific images of all time when they open the door on the ship to see him laughing manically with his eyes wide open. Not to mention his scene with the maid where he's laughing at her, she faints and he crawls towards her. You know what? I lied; this is still a scary movie and I will continue to watch it every Halloween. Bela is king and made Dracula one of the most terrifying monsters in movie history.9/10 "},{"Title":"A horror classic that still thrills and enchants!

Bela Lugosi became a cinematic legend after this movie, and his portrayal of Dracula basically invented the modern vampire as we know it. Murnau's silent classic 'Nosferatu' was an obvious influence on Todd Browning, but while Browning was no James Whale (the innovative British director who made 'Frankenstein' for Universal a few months after this) he added a lot of his own style and ideas to the project, and Counts Orloff and Dracula are completely different kinds of creatures. Lugosi made his Count sophisticated, attractive and sexy, and this is what made this movie such a sensation at the time, and what helps make it still a wonderful viewing experience. Lugosi's performance is one of the greatest in horror history. Some of the other actors in the cast are a bit shaky but Edward Van Sloan as Van Hesling is excellent and Dwight Frye's Renfield (a different character from the book) is also memorable. Both actors would reappear in 'Frankenstein'. 'Dracula' is an important landmark horror movie, but even better, is still a fantastic viewing experience seventy years later. Don't just watch it because it's a classic, watch it because it's wonderful entertainment!

One big reason was the technological advancement of sound. Roughly three years old by 1930, the public embraced the talking picture wholeheartedly over silents. The other big reason for Dracula's success was that the star of the stage play had been cast as the star of the film. And movie history was made. Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula is now a eighty-one year old icon, outlasting all other interpretations before or since. The twist is that this Dracula looks nothing like Stoker's creation (read the book). Lugosi, either through his work with the playwrights or later at Universal with Browning, devised the most insidious form the character would ever take- a handsome, courtly, well-groomed, civilized aristocrat, so gracious and attractive that he projected an aura of well-being over the viewer. This was worlds away from the Murnau/Max Schreck approach of head-on abomination in NOSFERATU. Sensibly, no one in their right mind would stay within viewing distance of Schreck (or Kinski in NOSFERATU, THE VAMPYRE and Dafoe in SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE) after the first glimpse. But Lugosi's Count would have you chatting and drinking wine- until he began to drink of you. That cape and those evening clothes are the perfect deception. Browning's Dracula is sometimes stagy and tentative in its continuity (it feels at times that the director was unsure where to go next in the progression of scenes). But Karl Freund's photography summons up a persistent mood of heavy gloom and enveloping dread. Two other assets in the film are Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Dwight Frye as Renfield. Van Sloan was Universal's resident Learned Man, appearing as an Egyptologist in THE MUMMY (1933), and perhaps most famously as Dr. Waldman in FRANKENSTEIN (1931). A career-long character actor, Dwight Frye was an eccentric talent who appears to have worked exclusively at Universal. He had his best role as Renfield, producing a still blood-curdling, sneering laugh that seemed to come from the depths of a hellish insanity. If you haven't seen this Dracula please do so. The Count awaits.

This is not due to Browning's technical achievements or directorial wizardry, by ANY means. It is due to Bela Lugosi's career-defining portrayal of the title character. Born in what is now Lugoj, Romania, Lugosi brings to the part the flavor of his homeland, making him more believable as Dracula. This other-worldly aesthetic helped to make his performance what many consider the ultimate incarnation of Stoker's Dracula. Having played the Count in Hamilton Deane's Broadway version of Dracula, which started in 1927, Bela Lugosi was more than prepared for the role when it was time to commit it to film. Still struggling with the English language, however, he had to learn his lines phonetically. European accent in tact, he was able to deliver such memorable lines as, I bid you welcome, Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make, and, of course, I am Dracula. His performance alone is reason enough to watch this monster movie classic. If only the rest of the film was as spectacular as Lugosi. Dwight Frye's Renfield, while perhaps a little too over-the-top, is still another highlight to the film, and even Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing is enough to challenge the might of Count Dracula. The rest of the film is rather flat to me. Now, I know it was made in 1931, and that, at the time, it horrified audiences, but I still stand by my opinion that the overall movie pales in comparison to Bela Lugosi's performance. Everyone else just seemed to be going through the motions, and it seems especially evident while Helen Chandler and David Manners are on screen. They just aren't convincing. I'm not saying that their performances ruin the film. It is still a classic, and certainly worth a viewing, but if you are in the mood for a vampire movie that is worthy of Bram Stoker's name, look no further than F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu. It is much more convincing and even scarier than Tod Browning's Dracula, despite being nine years older and silent. All in all, though, one cannot overlook the stellar performance of Bela Lugosi in the role he was born to play!

Despite many attempts by many talented film makers, I believe this version, directed by Tod Browning, remains the definitive take on the often-filmed novel.  But why?  Is it simply nostalgia?  Granted, I do fondly remember staying up late as a child watching this film on Ghost Host theater and finding myself suitably frightened.  However, if I were the same age today, would I find the film as effective?  Would a steady diet of more modern and explicit horror films made me too jaded to enjoy the more subtle charms of this film?  I hope not, but I could see how it might.  The film is slow, and its slowness is further emphasized by the absence of an under score.  It is stagey - being as it was more influenced by the stage play than the novel itself.  Also, the story plays itself out too quickly.  Van Helsing manages to figure everything out and dispatch the count in about two seconds.  There simply isn't much suspense - and even less gore or violence.  Yet it remains the champ.  Why?  The main reason is Lugosi himself.  He gives the performance of a lifetime.  He truly inhabits the role and is genuinely creepy.  The rest of the cast, particularly Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Dwight Frye as Renfield, support him admirably.  However, when I watch the old Universal horror films nowadays, I find myself really enjoying the atmospheric sets and lighting.  Yes, there is still much to love about Dracula today.

Dracula is a spectacular well-known classic vampire story, with a magnificent transposition of the Bram Stoker's novel to the cinema. Although being a 1931 black and white movie, the photography and the camera work are excellent. There are at least two magnificent scenes the long traveling of the camera in the sanatorium, from the yard to Remfield's room and the long stairway in the end of the movie to Dracula's tomb. The performances are quite theatrical, as usual in that period, and the film does not show any explicit violent scene. I dare to say that probably it is Bela Lugosi's best performance.

Although not the first film to feature the character of Count Dracula (a couple of lost silent films and F.W. Murnau's unauthorised version Nosferatu came before), Bela Lugosi's portrayal of the menacing and seductive Count is commonly seen as the definitive.The story is known to most &#x96; solicitor Renfield (Dwight Frye) arrives at Count Dracula castle at night, despite prior warnings by the nearby locals. He is greeted by Dracula, who, unknown to Renfield, is a vampire. Upon arrival, he pricks his finger, causing it to bleed which visibly excites Dracula until he spies the crucifix hanging around Renfield's neck. Renfield is drugged by Dracula and the two travel to London the next day by boat. When the ship arrives, only Renfield remains on the boat, now seemingly a lunatic and a slave to the Count. He is hospitalised while Dracula becomes entranced by a woman named Mina (Helen Chandler), who is engaged to John Harker (David Manners). As circumstances grow stranger, Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) becomes convinced that the Count is indeed a vampire, and that he must be destroyed.The film would be the beginning of a long run of successful horror movies made by Universal, which would be hits critically and commercially, and many are nowadays considered classics of the genre. Although falling short of the outright perfection of James Whale's Frankenstein (also 1931) and its sequel Bride Of Frankenstein (1935), Dracula still proves a great adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. Lugosi's performance is the definitive Dracula, his minimal movements and slow, pronounced dialogue, spoken with his Hungarian accent proves an unnerving Count. I'm not forgetting Max Schrek's Nosferatu, while amazing for its sheer dedication, it was hardly the Dracula of the book.Director Tod Browning, who up to the point of making Dracula had made over 50 feature films, controls the film superbly, and opts for slow, menacing darkness rather than loud jump scenes and special effects. It builds up the mood gradually, and with Lugosi's fantastic central performance, makes for an atmospheric experience. It's a pity that Browning would almost end his career the next year with the commercially disastrous Freaks, which I consider a true great of the horror genre.It's just a shame that the film's final scene is rather soft and anti- climatic, jarring with the brilliance that came before.

He is much taller than the other actors, which makes him look more powerful and makes his present felt. He is wonderfully scary. While it is obvious that it was made in 1931 during some scenes, it still strikes fear in the audience.The Mise-en-scene is incredible in this movie, particularly in the opening scene when the carriage comes speeding up the hill and quickly drops the man off to Dracula. There is a thick fog and darkness, Dracula wearing a black outfit covering everything, and cliffs in the background.

Todd could not have liked the fact that at night, the crew shooting the Spanish Version would look at Brownings daily shot and then re-shoot improved versions of their own with their cast.Still, the Spanish version did not have Bela. The rest of the cast around him played the roles real well. The real irony here is that Bela would only do the role one more time, making fun of himself in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein.

What music they make!","Date":"22 September 2011","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make! so said Bela Lugosi in what was to be the role that cemented him as a pop culture icon of American film. To see director Todd Browning's original 1931 adaptation of Dracula is to see the American horror film at its finest. Dracula is the vampire formula at its purest before it could be diluted by the telling and the retelling. Dracula is a surreal experience as Browning takes us with him on a journey into our fear of death, but also our fear of the filthiness of sex. It is a film that has aged like a good wine which Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula swore to never drink.If one were to try and dissect Todd Browning's Dracula to find a sole element of success the search would lead us time and time again to Bela Lugosi. Dracula simply is not Dracula without Lugosi's portrayal of the Count. So much credit has to be given to Lugosi and his portrayal of the titular character. It is doubtful this film would have the staying power, or the atmosphere that it has if another actor was portraying Count Dracula. Lugosi's performance and how it succeeds is the marriage of so many factors, but arguably Lugosi's greatest asset to his performance would have to be his rich Hungarian accent. Lugosi surprisingly doesn't get much dialogue in the film as much of the exposition comes from the protagonist Professor Van Helsing played by Edward Van Sloan, and Dracula's slave Renfield played by Dwight Frye. The lines Lugosi does deliver are often extremely concise. It is not the lines themselves, but rather the way Lugosi delivers them that creates this character. How Lugosi delivers the lines offers more insight into this character than any detailed dissection of the character could. Lugosi's lines are read almost phonetically, each word one by one, each little nuance of the language stressed in Lugosi's thick Hungarian dialect. The resulting effect is hypnotic, poetic, frightening, and in many ways very sad. Lugosi's introduction is in my humble opinion one of the strongest scenes in motion picture history almost solely based on the delivery of the line I am... Dracula. The scene follows Renfield, a solicitor whom Dracula will drive mad, as he ventures through Dracula's dilapidated castle searching for the Count. Dracula appears out of the shadows sucking in whatever air Renfield could muster in these catacombs of death by merely saying I am&#x85;Dracula. Lugosi's delivery is as much a part of the aging castle trapped in time as the cobwebs are. Lugosi was so suave and mysterious as Dracula that the audience became attracted to the vampire. Dracula is not merely Lugosi's picture though. The film has a strong supporting cast highlighted by actor Edward Van Sloan, and Dwight Frye. One thing that can be said of Dracula's entire cast is that despite the extreme material no one even comes close to going over the top with their role. The amount of sincerity and the absence of any tongue in cheek aspect of performance are to be admired. Sloan and Frye's characters both had the potential to skate towards over the top territory, but both performances are firmly grounded in reality and are very effective in complimenting Lugosi's Dracula.Dwight Frye is very strong as Renfield. The role is as complex as that of the Count. Renfield is a bipolar madman enslaved to do Dracula's bidding. Frye is asked to exhibit behaviors on all forms of the spectrum. This character and the characterization are unpredictable to the extreme. One constant about Renfield is that he is the predator, and he represents the fear of sexuality within the vampire mythos. Frye's facial expressions are other worldly especially when we see the extent of Renfield's madness. There is a scene where Renfield crawls with vulture eyes towards a housemaid who has fainted by the sight of his very appearance. Frye too is asked to deliver insight into a character despite the fact that the lines don't explicitly offer character exposition or development. Renfield's dialogue mainly consists of nonsensical lunatic ravings. The way Frye delivers the lines and how he builds the intensity is really powerful though. It is these build up of the madness that keeps this character effective.Technically Dracula isn't all that impressive a picture from a cinematographer's standpoint, but does it really need to be? Browning is very cautious about what he wants to do with his camera. Much of the film is very static and offers little to no movement of the camera. What Browning captures in his shots though are really powerful images. The amount of attention given to the detail of each shot truly is amazing. The fact is there is not one shot of Bela Lugosi blinking in the entire film; that shows an incredible commitment. Browning is more of a still photographer than he is a cinematographer, but the power of the images is unmistakably there. This static dream-like world is perfect for the subject material.It may hurt the pacing a tad, but an argument can be made that the audience are much better able to appreciate Bela Lugosi, and even Dwight Frye's performance due to the way Browning stages his picture. Browning's appreciation for the hypnotic quality of images is one of the strengths of the film, not one of the weaknesses.Dracula is a masterpiece of film making.

This time, I realized Dracula is set in the modern day. During the flower girl scene, you hear a car horn and see modern street lamps. Another question I ask for the first time Why did Dracula disguise himself as the carriage driver? Why hide his face? Despite this question, it is one of the most atmospheric scenes in a film built primarily on atmosphere.Modern critiques tend to say Lugosi is the sole graceful factor in a stagy film. True but don't undersell. Karl Freund's camera is not stationary. A pan around Renfield's shoulder, a slow move up steps, a panorama of Seward's sanatorium. Renfield leering from the ship or the shadow of the captain lashed to the wheel are just two chilling scenes. The use of shadows is toned down from Universal's silents and it's generally agreed that Freund's artistry was held back by Todd Browning. Wither Browning had trouble adapting to sound or was still grieving for Lon Chaney (and the version of Dracula they had planned on making) is debated.Either way, you can't deny the power of these images. The early shots of Dracula's castle, the brides awaking in the catacombs, the illogical armadillos, beetles in tiny coffins, Lugosi's glaring eyes. These images are the base upon which all American horror films are built. They still send chills up a viewer's spine seventy years later. The set design is incredible, particularly the dusty staircase of Castle Dracula or the ruins of Carfax Abbey. Supporting the sets are fantastic glass painted backgrounds.I won't waste words on why Lugosi is the iconic Dracula. He exudes an authority over everyone simply with his body language. Shots of him doing nothing but standing in shadow-swept doorways manage to be creepy.Given Dracula's sway over the opposite sex, it's easy to understand while the vampire is a fantasized character for men. But why is the vampire a sex symbol for women? The film is split on the issue. The scene of Dracula cornering the flower girl brings to mind nothing but sexual assault. I believe Dracula leaning over the sleeping bodies of his prey aren't meant to be provocative but rather to invoke classical nightmare imagery. We are all vulnerable when we sleep and many horror films prey on that innate vulnerably. (Yep, I just traced a line from Dracula to Freddy.) Dracula is feared by his female victims, yet still oddly attractive. Lucy doesn't seem totally asleep when Dracula comes for her. A later scene, where Mina walks into the count's arms, his cape wrapped around her, blending in with the shadows, is undoubtedly romantic. The vampire is a man with complete control over his females, psychic and sexual. Why women would desire such a mate is a topic unsuited for this blog. The seductive female vampire is a horror concept not yet solidified. Mina, once turned, seems less like a willing seductress and more like a drug addict, uncontrollably forced to attack her beloved husband.The movie is flawed, no doubt. Who the heck is the main character? The count is unknowable. Harker or Seward don't do anything besides wring their hands. Van Helsing comes in too late, Lucy exits too early, while Mina is a damsel in distress. Nope, it's gotta' be Renfield. We follow him from the beginning and he features in most of the scenes. A book must exists that explores his character more. There's a lot of untapped potential there. Dwight Fry had enough range to play a straight-laced businessman perfectly, even if his unhinged insanity is what we remember. When his spider is thrown away, you almost feel for the guy. His monologue about Dracula presenting him with a feast of rats is great and I wonder why no other adaptation has gone into more detail about that. Why does Dracula even keep the guy around? He doesn't serve him much and is even responsible for revealing the count's hiding place.The pacing drags in the latter half, as the staged qualities take over. There's a number of narrative question marks. Lucy's story arc is oddly abbreviated. We hear about her escapades as the Woman in White but Van Helsing disposes of her off-screen. Why does Dracula have Mina just hanging around the abbey at the very end? What purpose did that serve? Renfield preys on the unconscious maid in one scene but we never find out why. The guy sure gets out of his cell easy. Dr. Seward should probably hire a new staff. Dracula's final confrontation with Van Helsing is anticlimactic. Even the weaker second half of the film has its moments, such as Dracula making eye-contact with Mina's maid or smashing the mirror out of Van Helsing's hand.I'm not begrudgingly calling it a great movie. It remains the best adaptation of Stoker's novel in many ways and is the most important of the Universal Monster cycle in countless ways.

After years of living in a decrepit castle with his vampire brides, the notorious Count Dracula begins to mysteriously buy property in London with the help of a real estate agent named Harker. However, we soon learn that there is a sinister reason behind the Count's move, as he begins his reign of terror once he arrives in the City.Bela Lugosi created a character that would become the standard for all vampires. Sophisticated, charming but downright horrifying, Lugosi' Dracula still holds up as one of the most magnificent horror villains. Other stand out characters include Dwight Frye's disturbing portrayal of Harker, and Edward Van Sloan's Dr. Van Helsing.Eight decades after it first terrorized audiences, Dracula the film was falling apart. Decreased picture quality, and a significant hissing sound severely hurt the quality of one of the greatest films in the horror genre. But over the past 15 years, two great things have happened. The first, which is a bit controversial with film purists, was the inclusion of a new film score performed by renowned composer Philip Glass. I have to say, the score was much needed to help bring the film to modern times. The sophisticated, but eerie, score really adds depth to the scenes and is a profound upgrade for the quality of the film overall.Finally, in 2012, Universal did a full scale restoration of the film (along with the other Universal monster movies) for its release on blu ray. All I can say is WOW. The picture is nearly crisp, with a more balanced picture and virtually no scratches. Furthermore, that horrible hissing noise that plagued the film is significantly reduced, and for the first time in eighty years, the sounds and dialogue are as clear as the day the film was released. These restoration processes have dramatically inflated the quality and relevance of the film, helping to cement it as one of the most significant pieces to come out of the golden age of cinema.

It is creaky, like nearly all early sound movies, and there's not even a music score (one was added nearly 70 years later.) People move slowly, there are long gaps between lines which seem unnatural. At times, the entire movie seems to be playing in slow-motion. It's hard to imagine a teenager of today sitting still long enough to watch it, much less enjoy it. But to a film buff, there is still much to enjoy and the main thing this 'Dracula' has going for it is its own peculiar, unique sense of weirdness. Bela Lugosi's vampire seems to affect the other characters without ever biting their necks. They move about as if in a daze and speak in a halting, confused manner... including Edward Van Sloane's Professor Van Helsing, who's supposed to know what's going on. Perhaps stranger than Lugosi is Dwight Frye as Renfield, with his lunatic laughter (if one could call it that). Renfield pops up in scene after scene, even after he's supposedly locked away in his room at the sanitarium. The sets are every bit as odd. The lower chambers of Dracula's castle and later Carfax Abbey are as barren as the surface of a dead planet, just dirt and pillars and a few coffins. They truly look like places no human should go, places only for rats and wolves and bats. It's hard to believe Bela Lugosi was already 49 years old when he made 'Dracula.' He looks much younger. And though he doesn't have a great deal of dialogue, his most famous lines are all here. I never drink... wine. The children of the night... what music they make! Now that you have learned what you have learned. Harder still to believe that Universal only had him play Dracula once more, 17 years later, in 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein.' As stagy and slow-moving as it is, 'Dracula' earns its reputation as an original with its many indelible images and sparse, stark dialogue. It truly is one of a small group of films that everyone should see at least once.

Count Dracula was the part of a lifetime for Lugosi &#150; one that both made him a star and destroyed his acting career. He ended up being helplessly and hopelessly typecast as a result of the absolutely brilliant performance he offered as the vampire count. The voice, the eyes, the presence &#150; all Lugosi, all Dracula. From 1931 on, whenever anyone sees or hears Bela Lugosi (no matter what part he's playing) they see or hear Dracula, and &#150; even now, over 75 years later &#150; when someone does an imitation of Dracula, it's done in Lugosi's Hungarian accent. The typecasting is a shame, really &#150; because Lugosi was a superb actor. I've seen him in several films and even in the later work of his career, when many of the movies he was in were less than stellar, Lugosi &#150; when given a meaty enough role as opposed to a cameo &#150; could make even a weak movie worth watching. And it basically all started with Dracula.The movie itself has some problems &#150; foremost among them, because of the importance they play in the story &#150; are the bat appearances. Bats don't fly like that, and they certainly can't hover! The ending struck me as rather abrupt, and I found myself thinking that there should have been more, and throughout the movie there are still examples of the transition in acting style required by the transition to talkies &#150; especially what I consider to be deliberate over-acting, necessary in silent movies but sometimes distracting in talkies. Having said that, Lugosi even pulls that off well. His overly dramatic turning away from the wolfbane or cross and cowering behind his cape is in fact overly dramatic, and yet &#150; it's also Dracula. That's just what Dracula does when confronted by wolfbane or a cross, because it's how Lugosi played the part, and coming from Lugosi it seems perfectly natural.The movie isn't especially frightening or suspenseful. Even for someone who had never seen it in 1931, real suspense is lacking. We find out very quickly that Count Dracula is a vampire &#150; just a few minutes in Lugosi pops out of a coffin. The sets are very good though &#150; creating a sense of mystery and fear, even if there's nothing overly frightening about this. Whatever the strengths or weaknesses of the story, though, the movie is made by the performances &#150; Lugosi's obviously, but also Dwight Frye as his hapless victim Renfield, who becomes enamoured of eating flies and spiders and rats as a result of being turned into Dracula's slave. His performance is actually quite funny, and one thing lacking in the movie is any explanation of what happened to Renfield. After Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) dispatches Dracula does Renfield return to normal, as Mina (Helen Chandler) did, or does he spend the rest of his life in an insane asylum? That was a loose end that wasn't tied up.I've never read Bram Stoker's original novel, so can't comment on how this movie relates to Stoker's work, but I have seen many film versions of Dracula, and this is by far the classic version. Many other actors have played the evil count, but none have pulled it off as perfectly as Bela Lugosi. 8/10.

The pace is slow.  While Bela Lugosi's Dracula is menacing, the rest of the cast is colorless to the point of transparency.  There are some good gliding camera shots here and there (thank you, Karl Freund!), but the majority of the film is locked into stationary medium and long shots.  The film is tightly bound to its theatrical origins &#150; director Browning has his characters look at things out of frame and describe them rather than just showing us, which would be much more effective.Fortunately, `Dracula' improves with repeated viewings.  The glacial pace and lack of sound in many places gives the movie a nightmarish sense of menace. In fact, `Dracula' is somewhere between a nightmare and a piece of classical music &#150; everything proceeds at its own pace, gliding through the motions, gradually building suspense and momentum until the piece reaches climax.  The end result is a flawed but haunting, hypnotic masterpiece, and one of the greatest vampire films ever made.

This film was the birth of the horror film as we know it.  Its importance can not be underestimated.  Dracula is a wonderful film for so many reasons, but first let's look at its many faults.The film is by today standards very antiquated.  It has almost no soundtrack, stage acting for the most part, limited special effects, and a slow pacing.  It has long parts of little action and lots of chat.  It shows little while leaving much to one's imagination(a plus for those like myself that are good at envisioning what is not shown).  With all this not going for it, why is Dracula such a classic?  Why is it considered to be such a great film and a great horror film?The answer is that even with all these flaws (and bear in mind some of these flaws are not flaws for all) the film offers a rich story in an eerie, atmospheric way.  Bela Lugosi was Dracula.  He was the model for oh so many vampires to come.  His gesturing, his deliberation in speech, his facial movements all created a vampire never to be forgotten.  Despite Lugosi, however, is the real genius of the film....Tod Browning.  Browning created a movie and a setting hitherto imagined and conjured on a screen.  Browning was the man behind the camera that created the cob-webbed stairs of the Dracula castle and the squalid emptiness of the crypt.  He created the ghoulish female vampires thirsting for blood.

While Murnau's version is undoubtedly iconic and chilling,it's Browning's(slightly more accurate)take on the exploits of a certain blood sucking Count Dracula which paved the way for the Vampire genre we know so well today.Browning's favourite actor(the so called man of a thousand faces)Lon Chaney was the director's first choice for the role of Dracula.However when Chaney sadly passed away in August 1930 the role went to stage star Bela Lugosi.Lugosi had played the Count on stage for several years and it's his performance that dominates the film.It's mouthwatering(no pun intended)to think how Chaney would have been in the role and if he would have(through his famed make up)played the count as written(as an old man)or gone for the look Lugosi gave us.All the vampire and haunted house staples we know so well today begin here from the acres of thick cobwebs,afraid locals,bats etc.And far from being strange visually Dracula is shown as being very charming,charismatic,elegant and sexy.Although the actual blood sucking moments happen off-screen(unlike in The Hammer versions)the build up to said scenes is suitably chilling and downright creepy.The film is based on Stoker's novel and on the play by Hamilton Deane and John L.Balderstone. The film stars Bela Lugosi, Dwight Fry,Edward Van Sloan and Helen Chandler.The film begins with a few bars of Swan Lake playing over the image of a carriage making it's way through the mountains.Onboard is the tragic Renfield(Dwight Frye)who is travelling to the castle of Count Dracula(Bela Lugosi)to get his signature on the lease of a house in England.After being made to feel welcome by the charming Count he is hypnotised and becomes the mindless servant of the Count.The story then moves to the drawing rooms of England for mind games between Dracula and Van Helsing(Edward Van Sloan) and Frye almost steals the film from Lugosi as Renfield becomes a screaming,fly eating nutcase. Browning falters at the last sadly with his villain impaled off-screen with a barely audible groan.That aside what's here is top class from the performances,set design and atmosphere.Sadly Lugosi(unlike fellow horror icon Boris Karloff)found it difficult to escape this role in the future.He played the Count again in the comedy Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein(1948).And played Dracula-like characters The Return of the Vampire(1944)and Plan 9 from Outer Space(1959).He returned to play Dracula on theatre tours a few years before his death.And when he passed away he was buried in his Dracula costume.Whether you're a horror fan,a casual fan or new to the genre make sure you watch this.

There are the scary vampires, such as Count Orlok from Nosferatu, there's sparkly vampires like from Twilight, and there's the cool vampires and under that category, there's only one name that comes to mind Bela Lugosi.Lugosi may have tragically ended his career making some of the worst, most laughably bad productions of all time under deservedly infamous names such as Ed Wood, but for a while, he stood in the golden arches of Hollywood and nowhere else is this more evident than his iconic portrayal of Bram Stoker's famous vampire Dracula in this 1931 masterpiece of the same name. Who can forget Lugosi walking down the great steps of a rundown Transylvanian castle, hair sleeked back, clad in dark robes, a candle in one hand, a pale face, grinning, and announcing himself with deliberate hesitations and exaggerated pronunciation I am&#x85;Dracula. Or maybe I never drink&#x85;wine. Evidently, nobody can forget since basically every conception of a vampire, whether on stage or film or simply in the imagination mirrors Lugosi's performance in Dracula. This is one of the most influential and popular horror movies of all time. Now does it still terrify audience members as its advertisements claimed? No. No, Lugosi is not scary and I'm not quite sure he ever was. But if there is one thing that he is and most certainly always was, that is awesome. He's a spiffy, cool, groovy vampire who does not come across as unintentionally funny. He won't terrify you, he won't make you laugh unless he wants to, but he will keep you entertained because he's such a terrific screen presence.In short, yes, Lugosi is the primer behind Dracula, but the movie's reasons for sheer entertainment do not stop there. Dracula works so well and has aged so well simply because it is a great movie. The only regret I have about the movie is that it's only seventy-five minutes long, a common running time for films its age. And during that brief length of time, one finds the most terrific levels of absorbing entertainment. The screenplay is very well-written, the acting by the supporting cast especially by Edward Van Sloan as Professor Van Helsing is terrific, the camera-work is eye candy, the editing is absolutely fabulous. The special effects are a mixed bag. Sometimes you can tell the bats are nothing more than props on strings as they bobble up and down while hovering, but since this consumes only a few seconds of screen time, it's hardly a detractor.Dracula is so well made that to add a music score to its fabulous images really seems distracting. During its age, soundtracks were mostly prohibited since the invention of sound was brand new in the film industry. Looking back on the old films, there are some that seem in desperate need of an imposed musical score. A score was recently composed for Dracula and provided for as an option of the DVD release, but to put it over seems to detract from the movie, not strengthen it. Because the movie is nearly impeccable on its own with its acting, cinematography, dialogue, and sheer entertainment. This is one of the finest horror movies ever made.

Dracula is the first film to feature the dark lord of the undead and the character has been in over 700 films since, only being toppled by Sherlock Holmes. The film is based on the play version of the book by Bram Stoker. The book was inspired by Slain Castle, Whitby (where the count lives while in England), and Cruden Bay in Scotland and the history of Tepes Valad, a warlord. While in Cruden Bay, Bram's friends and relatives were afraid of him while he planned out the book. He would sit in front of the typewriter for hours on end. Despite rumors, Bram Stoker had never been to Transylvania. Dracula, the book, did not take off until after the author's death, but quickly became a must read after the movie. Due to the Depression the movie had a limited budget and is a lot different then the epic book, Bram Stoker's Dracula(1992) is the closest to the book movie to date.The strength of Dracula is the main character played by Bella Lugosi. His haunting portrayal of the title character is legendary. Bella didn't know much English and had to pronounce each syllable separately. Due to his poor English skills, he did not mingle with the rest of the crew, rumors also have it that he wanted to stay in character, but the cast and crew were impressed by him. As one of his few demands, Bella also did his own make up for his role. Bella's portrayal of Dracula was so good that it caused him to be type-casted for the rest of his career. Bella was even buried wearing one of the capes he wore in the in a stage version. Bauhaus, legendary goth rockers' first single was a song called Bella Lugosi's Dead, it made references to Dracula and if Bella really was a vampire. Bella's performance went on to scare people to the point of fainting in the movie theater and providing hunting's on TV starting in 1957 and been giving kids nightmares ever since. Rumour also has it that the infamous Hannibal Lector's slurping sound in Silence of the Lambs was inspired by when Dracula sees Renfield's blood.Unlike vampire movies to come, Dracula in this film did not have fangs, Dracula is killed off stand and there were armadillos in Dracula's castle. Armadillos are not native to Europe or England. However, because Dracula was the first film with the title character, it became the staple of Dracula films including Starting in Transylvania with Renfield as the real estate agent instead of Jonathan Harker, cutting several characters, including an American who's knife eventually kills the count, Dracula being staked in England and several things are changed from the book. In Stoker's book vampires don't sleep in coffins, vampires don't cast shadows either and the no reflection in a mirror was invented by Stoker.The movie's special effects may appear to be cheesy by today's standards. But the fake flapping bat, the piecing gaze of Dracula, the walk through the spider web and Dracula coming out of his coffin has frightened people to nightmares. The overwhelming performance of then unknown actor Bella Lugosi sealed the movie as one of the scariest and influential roles in movie history.

Starring Bela Lugosi who reprized his 1927 stage performance, up to then, with some movies to his credit, he was basically an obscure actor until Dracula hit the theater screens. It should be noted, however, that for Lugosi's sixth billed supporting role performance as a police inspector in Tod Browning's THE THIRTEENTH CHAIR (MGM, 1929), starring Conrad Nagel, comes close to being the major lead. Two years later, Dracula has Lugosi's name heading the cast for the first time, making him an overnight sensation and a new master of horror. Like some subsequent Universal horror films of the early 1930s, Dracula opens its main titles with the underscoring of Swan Lake.The familiar plot features Count Dracula, a vampire from Transylvania, who rises from his grave at night to seek victims from whom he can suck out blood from their necks, and rest in his coffin by day. The first twenty minutes of the story, in which Mr. Renfield (Dwight Frye) comes to Castle Dracula via horse and carriage, to discuss some real estate property in England, and becoming Drac's first on screen victim, is horror film making at best - wolves howling, atmospheric background, with the count seen slowly rising from his coffin, accompanied by his three vampire wives, surrounded in gigantic spider webs, rats and other unrecognizable creatures crawling about which add to the mood and creepiness. After Dracula puts Renfield under his spell to use him as his slave, they come to England where Renfield is later placed in an asylum, and Dracula places his coffin with Transylvanian soil in a mansion next door to Doctor Seward (Herbert Bunston) and his daughter, Mina (Helen Chandler), a young girl engaged to John Harker (David Manners). Of course Dracula has his eyes on Mina and intends on making her his next vampire wife by putting her under his evil spell. Then there's Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), knowing about the vampire legend, who must find a way to save Mina's immortal soul and destroy Dracula.At the time Dracula was released, Universal produced a Spanish language version starring Carlos Villarias. While there were some added bonuses in the Spanish version, which runs about a half hour longer than the English version, Lugosi's performance with glassy eyes and deadly stare make it more appealing to the avid horror movie lover. Lacking background music during most of the proceedings, Dracula was presented with a new under scoring in 1999. After viewing the scored Dracula, the best thing that can be said about it is to leave well enough alone. Thank goodness Dracula did not have the misfortune of being colorized. However, the Spanish language version with English subtitles is highly recommended, All the versions mentioned are available on video cassette (later DVD) and formerly shown on both the Sci-Fi Channel and American Movie Classics (1991-92) before shifting over to Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere October 10, 1998).Bela Lugosi would play vampires in future film roles, but reprized his Count Dracula role only once, in ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948) starring the comedy team of Bud and Lou. Sadly it would become Lugosi's last decent movie role of his career. Sequel DRACULA'S DAUGHTER (1936), in spite the absence of Lugosi, is another one worth seeing.(*** bats) "},{"Title":"Lugosi is Dracula","Date":"11 March 2015","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" There is no doubt that Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula is not only one of the most recognizable but also one of the most popular of the Draculas.

I was a big fan of this film not only because it is an American classic but because it is a true horror film. In my opinion, too often in horror films today, the story itself isn't scary at all. The experience of going to the movie theatre with a huge screen and incredibly loud speakers help scare audiences by having things pop out when you are least expecting it.

Despite it becoming a world wide sensation, it would not be until 1931 when Bram Stoker's ultimate example of Victorian Gothic would become a feature film. Starring legendary Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi, the plot is something that almost everyone knows by heart now. Ancient vampire Count Dracula desires for something more than the surroundings of his decrypt castle and decides to make way to England so he can continue his blood sucking ways there. Naturally the people of Britain don't take too kindly to this and from there it's a race against the clock before Dracula can kill again.Film audiences today might find Universal's version campy and more of a comedy than horror. But let's not forgot this was when filmmaking was still in infancy and funny or not, this is the film that laid the foundation for what vampires are supposed to be in our mind. Prior to this, Bela Lugosi was making a nice living on Broadway as the caped fiend when Universal approached him for this role and as a result of that decision, he was launched into the stratosphere of stardom. With his iconic cape, heavy accent, and ice, cold eyes, Lugosi set the standard that all other actors in the role would be measured against and because of that, even in this age of Twilight(Blah), is still the epitome of all vampires. Watch as he stalks the streets of Victorian London and try to tell yourself that he's not spooky or even just a little bit cool. Director Todd Browning masterfully adapted Stoker's work by incorporating all the Gothic elements that made the novel a classic, from the decrypted old castle of Dracula to the black and white shots of cemeteries and crypts. Rounding out the cast is Dwight Frye as the na√Øve real estate agent turned insanely devoted servant of Dracula (Frye's maniac look and laugh through out the film should have earned him an Oscar or at least a nomination) Edward Van Sloan as Dracula's chief nemesis Van Helsing, Helen Chandler as Mina, David Manners as John Harker, plus many more small time actors who make the film that much more memorable. You can laugh at the bat on string all you want but the image of Lugosi stalking someone in their bedroom in the dead of night has haunted a many young child's dreams and truth be told, still kind of does. And on that note, don't let this classic pass you by and while I'm at it, don't forget to keep your crucifix and garlic close when you turn off that light!

It was the start of the horror movie genre, Classic Lugiso lines including cheeldren of the naight, I nevair dreenk vine and I am Count Draculaaa, and no doesn't say, I vant to dreenk your vlodd. The scene where Dracula meets Van Helsing is a classic, especially when Van Helsing asks what sort of creature makes marks on a neck, and the maid introduces Count Dracula. This scene is quickly followed up by the lack of Dracula reflection in the mirror. Dwight Frye's Renfield is excellent, his creepy laugh and the expression on his face when he is not given his insects is memorable. Bela Lugosi epitomizes the perfect Dracula, no other actor has ever matched Lugosi's Dracula. Combined with Dwight Fryes Renfield, they were the perfect pair for this movie.

Carl Laemmle practically took out a patent on those films. The sets were already on the lot, he just kept making Frankenstein, Wolfman, and Dracula films at minimal cost and they made money for Universal. In fact until Deanna Durbin started singing for this studio and Abbott&Costello brought over their vaudeville routines, these horror films were the bread butter of Universal Pictures.Interestingly enough though Bela Lugosi only played the role of Count Dracula twice on film, he became so overwhelmingly identified with the part that Lugosi's whole life was taken over by the undead Count. He was buried in fact in his Dracula costume.Lugosi however did portray the vampire Count on Broadway in a play adapted from the Bram Stoker novel three years before he did the screen version for Universal. It was on Broadway that Lugosi first got acclaim for Dracula. Carl Laemmle bought the screen rights to the play after seeing Lugosi on stage and just in time for sound. Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Herbert Bunston as Dr. Seward also came over from the Broadway cast.Although Bela got his career role from this film, Edward Van Sloan as the vampire killer Van Helsing also got the role that people identify him with. Van Sloan practically duplicated his role in The Mummy which also became another series of horror films for Universal.Oddly enough Lugosi himself killed the Universal horror genre by that second appearance as Count Dracula in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. When those mythic horror monsters became comic foils for Bud and Lou, the demand ceased for these kind of films. It only started again when British Hammer films revived the genre by making them far more explicit and bloody.Still with that Hungarian accented voice of cultured menace, Bela Lugosi remains for purists the only real Dracula ever put on screen, Christopher Lee notwithstanding. Like in The Mummy which I've also reviewed good use is made of themes by Tschaikovsky as background music by Director Tod Browning. But it's Bela Lugosi who makes this film a horror picture for the age. Dracula will be still frightening viewers centuries from now. After all vampires are eternal.

It doesn't matter that Stoker's vampire was more of a hairy giant while Lugosi's interpretation is late 19th Century Continental. He brings more to mind the ruined White Russian princes who populated the hot spots of London and Paris in the early 20th Century than he does any kind of 15th Century Inquisition leftover. It matters not. Lugosi connects with the audience, with his intense eyes and bizarre mesmeric hand motions. His gravity is undeniable, and he's like a dark star twisting and attracting everything else in the movie around him -- much like Dracula himself.Browning's direction is understandably derided, although his film would have benefited from a more extravagant production. The conclusion of the movie in particular seems rushed and inadequate. But it's grossly unfair for so many critics, professional and amateur alike, to claim that the film would be better off without him. Even more ridiculous are the claims that the film was directed by Karl Freund. I've seen most of Freund's directorial films and most of Browning's, and this is absolutely Browning's film and his cinematic vision, take it or leave it. The main positive Browning can be credited with, a sort of vestigial reminder of the great Lon Chaney with whom he had collaborated so many times in the past, is the sense of empathy for the outsider that imbues the film with real poignancy. Not for a moment do any of the normal characters like Jon Harker or Mina seem like real people; but Browning paradoxically manages to make Lugosi's vampire come alive, as well as Dwight Frye's amusingly disturbed Renfield. It's not right to credit Lugosi with the lion's share of the accolades, as so many do. Take a look at most of his later films, even his higher-budget collaboration with Benjamin Christiansen a year after this film. Lugosi only reached these heights again when, as in the popular White Zombie, he imitated his performance for Browning. Not to mention that Browning's entire filmography, from the Chaney works like Unholy Three and Unknown through his subsequent work on the infamous Freaks, is marked by the same kind of trenchant identification with the most extreme social outcasts imaginable. Browning's Dracula is another extension of the same idea -- Dracula's lust for blood is the only real emotion on display in the entire film, and it would be a giant mistake to assume that was accident or incompetence.Only in the scenes with Renfield, however, does Browning's trademark dark humor really come into play. Otherwise the film is objectionably dry in tone. The weird atmosphere of the Transylvanian scenes is never equaled by the mausoleums of London which look like the cheap sets they are. What's really important though is the image that you're left with after the movie is over, and that's of Lugosi's magnificent performance.

It includes a quality print of the Bella Lugosi Dracula, with options to play the film with Philip Glass' recent soundtrack; the so-called Spanish Dracula starring Carlos Villarias; and a fascinating documentary hosted by Carla Laemmle, who has a bit role in the Lugosi Dracula and who was niece to Universal studio head Carl Laemmle. There is also an audio track by David J. Skal, production notes, and the like.The Lugosi Dracula is somewhat problematic. Dracula had been previously (and illegally) filmed as the silent NOSFERATU, and a later stage adaptation proved a staple of the British theatre. When the stage play at last arrived in New York, the title role fell to Bela Lugosi. Although Universal optioned the material, studio head Carl Laemmle was not enthusiastic about it; although European films were comfortable with the supernatural, American films were not, and Laemmle did not believe the public would accept such an irrational story. Nor was Laemmle interested in Lugosi; if Dracula was to be filmed, it would be filmed with Lon Chaney.When Chaney died the screen role went to Lugosi by default, but there were further issues. Originally planned as a big-budget production, the deepening Great Depression made the film's box office possibilities seem even slighter than before and its budget was cut to the bone. And Todd Browning, who had been such a successful director of the macabre in the silent era, proved clumsy with sound. The resulting film was more than a little clunky--but it had two things going for it a superior first thirty minutes and Lugosi. Although Lugosi's performance may seem excessively mannered by today's standards, audiences of the 1930s found it terrifying--and even today, when the character of Dracula comes to mind, we are more likely to think of Lugosi than other actor that later played the role.For a brief time after the advent of sound, several studios made foreign language versions of their productions. The Spanish Dracula was one such film, and when the English language company wrapped for the day the Spanish speaking cast arrived and filmed through the night using the same sets. This gave the Spanish company the benefit of hindsight they were perfectly aware of what the English language company was doing, and they deliberately set out to best it. The result is a somewhat longer, more cohesive film with some of the most arresting visuals and camera work of the early sound era. But unfortunately, star Carlos Villarias was no Bella Lugosi although much of his performance was more subtle than Lugosi's, it was also less intimidating, and where today Lugosi seems mannered, Villarias seems unfortunately comic. In a perfect world, we would be able to insert the Lugosi performance into the Spanish Dracula. As it is, we are left with two deeply flawed but nonetheless fascinating films.In their own ways, both films proved incredibly influential, and it is difficult to imagine the evolution of the classic-style horror film without reference to both the Lugosi and the Spanish Dracula. The Lugosi film is not perfectly restored, but the print is very, very good, easily the best I have seen. The Spanish Dracula has more problematic elements, partly due the fact that the film borrowed some scenic footage from the Lugosi version and snips of footage from earlier films (there even appears to be a brief clip of the ballet from the silent PHANTOM OF THE OPERA in the film); the film is sometimes dark, sometimes very spotted, but short of a cgi restoration this is probably as good as it gets.The Philip Glass soundtrack, which is optional, tends to divide viewers. The Lugosi Dracula had virtually nothing in the way of soundtrack; the Spanish Dracula used music to a greater degree, but even so that degree is comparative. The Glass score is often quite interesting, but it is also as often intrusive as it is effective. Some feel it adds quite a bit to the film; others find it distracts. Whatever one's reaction to the film, either English or Spanish language, or with or without the Glass score, this is a remarkable DVD package, and fans of classic horror will find it an almost inexhaustible pleasure. I cannot recommend it too strongly.Gary F.

I say loosely because the majority of the film is the work of film director Todd Browning and bears little resemblance to Stoker's literary masterpiece. Don't be fooled, though, because the film is just as powerful and as engaging as Stoker's original story.Bela Lugosi won the role of the Count (again) after Universal's first choice, Lon Chaney, passed away prematurely from throat cancer. So, in this respect, the passing of a silent horror star made way for the birth of a new, talking horror star. Lugosi electrified movie audiences with his eerie portrayal of a man hungry for blood. The film begins as Renfield (Dwight Frye) makes his way to the Count's mountaintop abode in Transylvania. He is meeting the mysterious Hungarian aristocrat in order to finalize the lease on a dilapidated structure called Carfax Abbey, which is situated in London, England, and which the Count has recently purchased. Not long after meeting Dracula, Renfield is rendered insane and is committed to Doctor Seward's (Herbert Bunston) psychiatric asylum located just steps away from Dracula's recent acquisition, Carfax Abbey.ow that Count Dracula and Renfield are both ensconced in London, England, all havoc breaks loose &#x97; from innocent flower girls dropping dead in the streets to performances of the Royal Ballet's Swan Lake being infiltrated by an evil Hungarian bloodsucker on the prowl. Soon, the women in this film are dropping like flies. First, the love-struck Lucy (Frances Dade) is brought down, and then her best friend &#x97; and Jonathan Harker's (David Manners) fianc√©e &#x97; Mina (Helen Chandler) is pursued. Clearly, Dracula has an insatiable appetite for women of the meek and blonde variety.Thankfully Mina's demise is stalled by the ever-alert Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), who clashes with Dracula from the very start. Van Helsing is an expert on mysterious ailments and mythical creatures of the night. He identifies the Count as the girls' assailant almost immediately. Van Helsing's will is strong and he is able to battle Dracula better than anybody else. It is truly a battle of brains and brawn between these two formidable characters, and watching them go head to head is a real treat! As we previously mentioned, Van Sloan and Lugosi had worked together before on the 1927 stage version of Dracula, and their on screen chemistry is just fantastic.Lugosi is an absolute delight to watch &#x97; well, aside from the fact that he can't seem to stop preying upon defenceless young women. Simply speaking, Lugosi was born to play the role of Count Dracula. Even if you have never seen this film before and are unfamiliar with Lugosi, his image is still the first one you picture when someone mentions the ubiquitous Transylvanian count. He was handsome, rather than grotesque, and that is one of the biggest reasons why his variation of the Count was considered so dangerous. He embodies Count Dracula from the top of his head through to his long claw-like hands, down to his expertly shined shoes. His long cape flutters behind him, almost dancing along as he hunts down innocent females to feed upon.If you are new to this film, one of the first things you will notice is that there is no musical soundtrack. Some may view that as a negative, but upon closer inspection, the silence that ensues in the most frightening scenes actually adds to the story's intense atmosphere. Together with the lack of mood music, the cinematography and camera-work in Dracula are quite impressive, considering the film's age and how new this medium still was back in the early 1930s. The close-ups of the Count are chill inducing and the images that were captured on film really stay with you for hours and even days afterwards! It will be a long while before I sleep with my window open ever again; that is for sure.The set design and decoration is typical of most 1930s era films (heavily influenced by the Art Deco movement), especially the scenes set in Carfax Abbey. Just one glimpse of that humongous twisting stone staircase sets my heart on fire! Though Count Dracula is a wealthy aristocrat, his living spaces are primitive and decrepit and they beautifully illustrate his very nature as a monster. On the other end of the spectrum, Doctor Seward's living and working quarters are very robust and welcoming, warm and inviting, ostentatious yet practical for a man who studies medicine and psychiatry.Dracula has left an indelible mark on movie audiences since its premiere in 1931. It is widely considered a cult horror classic unrivalled by many of today's modern horror fare. Mention it to anyone who has seen it before and their eyes will inevitably light up as they begin offering you tales of the first time they sat down to watch the movie. It is a film that will continue to live on well past our lifetimes, cementing the Count's immortality for generations to come.http//juliekinnear.com/blogs/movies-realtors-Dracula "},{"Title":"Dracula may be dead, but the classic horror genre will live for eternity.","Date":"23 October 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" After almost one hundred years of cinematic macabre nail and neck biting, Dracula still lives on, although his looks have changed enormously over those times. From the monstrous looking thin, bald creature in Nosferatu to the changing looks of Gary Oldman in Francis Ford Coppola's 1993 masterpiece (which Leslie Nielsen got to spoof in Dracula-Dead and Loving It), Dracula remains an undying undead character of fiction, even if there was a real life Vlad the Impaler who was the basis for Bram Stoker's novel of the legend of the vampire.Even with Oldman's unforgettable performance and other Draculas (such as Christopher Lee and Frank Langella), it is Bela Lugosi's performance as the count which remains the visionary for this creature of the night. Even though he lives in a Carpathian mountain castle loaded with cobwebs and strange looking rodents, he is definitely a creature of class, although his choice of beverage does not include wine and his nightlife doesn't include going to the theater or ballet. He enjoys another dance, the dance of death, and other than one statement about how glorious it would be to be really dead, he is totally unapologetic of his lustful desire for human plasma.Has there ever been a more haunting carriage ride than David Manners' journey through the Carpathian mountains? The mountain range looks absolutely desolate, in fact absolutely lifeless. It's obviously Lugosi driving the buggy, his eyes piercing in the dark without words as he picks Manners up from the fleeing carriage that is desperate to get out of the area. When Manners arrives at Dracula's castle, it becomes all the more eerie, with Lugosi's friendly greeting obviously plotting something more ominous as he declares, I bid you welcome!. Even as Dracula changed looks over the years, his high-born nature never allows Dracula to be as crude as the monstrous creature of Nosferatu. By not giving a backstory to the count's life, he remains a monster, yet one of noble birth, who is destined for evil and a gruesome demise.While the 1992 remake is certainly a superb romantic vision of the creature, this version makes no effort to romanticize him which gives Lugosi an element of mystery in his performance. He has a few scenes in dealing with the London characters he encounters in a social setting, but most of the time, he is brandishing his cape around to trap some unsuspecting victim in his web. The Mina of Helen Chandler is a sweet, rather stereotypical ing√©nue with little to do other than look petrified as she falls under Dracula's spell. Lugosi is supported with fine performances by Dwight Frye as the psychotic Renfield and Edward Van Sloan as the very determined Van Helsing. The use of music from Swan Lake over the opening gives an eerie feeling. Appropriately slow moving in spots, it is almost opera like in the way it is presented. It is just too bad that when this became a Broadway musical, it was done so blandly that I had to refer to it as the most bring $100 I've ever spent in my life.

Not simply among horror films, but a landmark for all of cinema. It played a vital role in moving the horror genre into the sound era, and setting the blueprints for the various other 'monster' films that followed throughout the 30's and 40's. It also cemented the Universal brand as being the chief mass entertainers of the age, with their brand of Gothic horror leaving a gigantic mark on film history. However, outside of this titanic influence, does the film still hold up after 83 years?Firstly the acting. Bela Lugosi's Dracula is truly immortal and has not aged a day. It still holds as a perfect example of actor and character becoming one, and there is a reason that Lugosi stands as the iconic Dracula, despite innumerable other renditions of the character. Dwight Frye is also wonderful as Renfield, bringing chilling creepiness to every scene he inhabits. He also carries a sympathetic weight and tragedy throughout adding layers to the role. Between these two, the acting is already a treat regardless of the other performances. Edward Van Sloan is the only other performance of note, filled with the authoritative dignity the man was renown for. However despite these great stars in the leading roles, the supporting cast is a massive letdown. Average at best, distressingly bland and wooden at worst. Many scenes begin to slump together as a result of these limp performances. Overall however the acting does stand strong due to the leads, but suffers from uneven support.The set design and imagery is stunning. One of the most iconic Gothic mansion ever put to film features in the opening, a true treat for a fan. However the visuals do dip slightly upon arrival in England, where more generic period sets feature. Some nice lighting and creepy highlights (a sequence featuring live rats running around in a coffin filled basement in particular) do keep the momentum of the opening go throughout however, so overall the sets and imagery do hold up well. The cinematography is far more dated, it is often stiff and doesn't take full advantage of the locations. This fault was fixed in the alternate Spanish version of the film, with far more haunting camera movements.The lacking score is a dividing point for many. Some view it as creepy and ambient, where's other feel it is awkward and an example of the holdover elements from silent cinema. I personally agree more with the later, however it does work at times (the rat sequence once again springs to mind).Overall the film is still strong. However when compared to the work's of contemporaneous director 'James Whale' (who also made monster films for Universal), it is clear that it is severely lacking in polish and shows its age far more than it really should. There is enough immortal material here to warrant its continuous status as a classic. However many elements hold it back, not least of which is an almost laughably anti-climatic climax and ending which leave an oddly sour taste in the mouth.

Horror had existed as a largely expressionistic medium in countries like Germany for much of the early 1900s, but when Universal Pictures decide to put its hand in the monster-movie pot, horror would never be the same again.1931 saw the beginning of the Great Depression and movie studios began hurting. Dracula's financial performance led to the lengthier viability of Universal Pictures' studio and jump-started several other horror films known as the Universal class monster movies. With that being said, it also placed Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi on the map in addition to furthering the career of filmmaker Tod Browning.Dracula is more than a curious piece of history in the regard that its atmosphere and acting still hold up today, but I think the appeal for viewers will be greatly diminished if they have seen the classic vampire picture Nosferatu from 1922. That film relied more on the sheer ugliness and daunting presence of the monster - with much material taken from the Bram Stoker novel. Dracula, on the contrary, uses the Broadway play as its source, retracting the ugly traits of Dracula to make him dashing rather than daunting. Suave rather than scary. And somewhat attractive rather than a vile monster.Such decisions were completely creative on part of writer Garrett Fort and director Tod Browning (and the uncredited Karl Freund). I can admire and respect their visions but I can't bring myself to prefer it to the 1922 classic. With Nosferatu being the first Dracula film (not counting the lost films of Russia from 1920 or the other lost film from Hungary called Dracula's Death), it's fair to say that a standard was unintentionally set. And having seen that masterpiece, seeing Dracula was a pleasant but ultimately a somewhat unrewarding experience.The film revolves around the titular count who arrives in Transylvania on business. The residents fear the count and his ominous castle, and fear only continues to brew when he attempts to start a relationship with young Mina (Helen Chandler), the daughter of Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston) who runs the nearby mental hospital.Is it necessary to go further since the story is so classic? Moreover, Lugosi is brilliant here, with his elegant portrayal of a monster formerly seen as brooding and homely. Subtle movements Lugosi makes in the film feel like bold statements and whenever he speaks, the presence of a shivering echo always exists. Lugosi in addition to Karl Freund's beautiful cinematography that guides us through Dracula's spacious concubine with exceptional clarity and placement.The look of the film - thanks to the professional touch of Freund in this particular film - is what Universal began to rely on with each of their monster films, which will probably get to be a redundant, overused statement as I visit many of these films within the next few days. Browning's Dracula, as a whole, works as competent entertainment, but pails in comparison to its silent film predecessor that proves to be scary even as it approaches its one-hundredth year anniversary. Dracula's effectiveness has been demoted to that of a basic mood-setter, if anything.Starring Bela Lugosi, Helen Chandler, and Herbert Bunston. Directed by Tod Browning.

I will say that they don't make them like this anymore, Lugosi makes the film and will always be the definitive version of the legendary vampire, Count Dracula. He's so creepy in the role that he didn't need fangs because his movements and facial expressions are chilling. Frye plays Renfield, Chandler plays Mina, Manners plays her fianc√©e, Jonathan, Dade plays Mina's friend, Lucy, Bunston plays her father, Dr. Seward and Van Sloan not only plays Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing, but also appears in other horror classics, Frankenstein, The Mummy and Dracula's Daughter. The film gets flack for not staying true to the novel and may have obvious flaws like wire-hanging bats, but it works for the imagination and they did what they could since they didn't have the technology/resources we have now. This classic has a good spooky atmosphere and I recommend it.

Originally the reanimated corpses of peasants who stank and looked grotesque, in the Romantic era of the 19th century the vampire was re-imagined as a sauve, aristocratic, and above-all hypnotically charismatic creature who is able to fascinate with a curious erotic allure. This archetype would then blossom and achieve literary immortality in Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic novel. Moving to the silver screen, in 1922 German Expressionist director F.W. Murnau made 'Nosferatu', an unauthorised version of Stoker's novel which ran into legal trouble and thought destroyed for many years. Thankfully, copies of the film survived and it remains a striking film in its own right but nevertheless doesn't have the pop-culture punch that Tod Browning's 1931 film has enjoyed since its release. The reason, well&#x85;Max Schreck's portrayal of Count Orlock is of a grotesque monster, closer to the smelly peasants of the original vampire myth. Hardly erotically alluring. Whereas, in contrast, Bela Lugosi's portrayal of the Count is closer to Stoker's image of aristocratic grandeur and exquisite Gothic decay&#x85;which is, well, much more alluring.However, despite the high point of Lugosi's definitive performance of the Count, the film is not perfect and should be approached with caution due to the risk of disappointment. Although cinema had been around for a while by the 1930s and many incredible films had been produced (i.e. in Germany with the likes of 'Nosferatu' (1922) and 'The Cabinet of Dr' Caligari', and also in the US with the likes Universal's own 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1923) and 'The Phantom of the Opera' (1925)) many films, especially from Hollywood, produced in this era are shot and paced much like theatre as the inherent potential of cinema as a unique art-form was still being established. This seems especially the case in 'Dracula' as it was based on a Broadway adaptation of the novel (taking a few liberties with the original plot along the way) and when the action is taking place anywhere but Dracula's lavish yet crumbling castle, I can see how it would be difficult for many to suspend one's disbelief. Also, it must be said, the bat is absolutely laughable which also sadly distracts from the air of menace the film goes to great lengths to create. Consequently, as a result of such weaknesses, the film has lost a lot of the bite it may have had back in the day (pun intended).So while, as a whole film, 'Dracula' certainly has its weak points and doesn't really stand up to the magnificence of, say, James Whale's 'Frankenstein' released the same year, or Browning's own 'Freaks' released the following year (which promptly destroyed his career and was forgotten for decades until it was rediscovered in the 1960s for the masterpiece it is). However, 'Dracula' was a commercial smash at the time, made possible the Hollywood monster boom of the 1930s, rightly made a star of Lugosi, and served up the definitive cinematic presentation of the Count. No small feat&#x85;and while the film may not scare the modern viewer, it still has a certain power to seduce.

Bela's facial expressions, graceful mannerisms, and underlying evilness create a powerful character that you can't take your eyes off.

The chilling music and sets and truly spooky ambiance of this movie cannot be understated! The highlight of visiting any wax museum is finding Bela Lugosi as Dracula!

And just like Frankenstein, fans could care less. Once again, this is a movie that is so classic, and so iconic, that it doesn't matter if it does justice to the book or not. Just like how Boris Karloff set the popular image of Frankenstein's monster, Bela Lugosi set the popular image of Dracula. His clothing, his haunting stare, his rhythmic voice, Bela Lugosi is Dracula. This movie also has one of my favorite movie quotes of all time Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make. Now since this movie was the first sound horror movie (well technically it was The Cat Creeps, but that film is lost), there isn't much sound other than dialogue. The lack of a soundtrack may bother people, but to me, that just makes the movie much more haunting. Even though I love this movie, I still know it has its fair share of flaws. A lot of the side characters aren't very memorable, and the ending is kind of rushed, but those flaws don't really bother me. For the first sound horror movie, it's still great. I love the over the top acting. I love the fake bats. I love the Gothic sets. I love classic monster movies like this. This movie may not be for everyone, and I would have to admit that there are better vampire movies out there (Nosferatu, Let the Right One In, the Hammer Dracula series, and Spanish Dracula), but this is a must see for any classic horror buff. Bela Lugosi and Dwight Frye steal the show with their haunting and over the top performances, but the rest of the cast is still very good. I don't think this movie is a good as Frankenstein (1931), but it is still one of the most iconic and most innovative horror flicks of all time. It may be flawed, but that's OK with me. I understand the time it was made and how there were limits on what they could do with their budget, so I think it should not be overlooked.

I have a strong fancy for Gothic literature, film, and music. This film is very much that Gothic. So therefore I approve it thoroughly. This is a film from a different era. It's 1931. Only in 1922 did the now famous Nosferatu come out in it's full silent German expressionist glory but this film is with sound and lost the distorted look of expressionism. It's a classic just by these merits. But there are some things that a modern viewer might raise an eyebrow at no music, the acting style, the flow of the film....The acting is of a different kind. The actors/actresses don't overact but exude the energy of their characters. Dracula is very Dracula, Renfield is very insane, and so on. They are exactly what they are cast as and that's good. The scenery is amazing.There are a few faults with the film which snapped me out of the dream. Some scene transitions were very fast; by that I mean the story seemed to be told too fast and the transition of events weren't fully elaborated. I knew what happened, having read the book and seen many other Dracula films, but I felt that it should have slowed down some parts. I really wanted to see more and more but at these times was thinking okay, that's happening already, no set up to it?At times I laughed out aloud at some ridiculous parts such as a wasp/bee coming out of an apparent mini coffin, armadillos lurking the castle, and Dracula's stare which occasionally went from being soul crushing to being absurd.The sets are amazing. At times you have to pause the film to admire it even though it is in a grainy sepia tone.All in all you have to watch this.

It is considered a classic mainly because of its importance and influence in film history. Viewed today, its slow and awkward like many early sound features. Nosferatu has aged a lot better. Most of the blame has to go to Tod Browning. The man made some good silent films, but was obviously unable to adjust to sound immediately. The shots and direction of the dialog are awkward and stodgy. This can be attributed to the fact its based mainly on a stage play version of Dracula instead of the novel. There are many moments when this screams for a music score. Additionally, scenes tend to drag along like molasses and the action is often confusing. Don't expect to be able to follow it easily from when they arrive in London. This was terrifying to audiences when released, but today it lacks any tension. Browning as a director improved greatly with his next picture Freaks.The support acting varies. Dwight Frye is entertaining but over-the-top and campy, whereas Edward Van Sloan is far too subdued and only comes to life when confronting Dracula. Both actors were much better in Frankenstein. Helen Chandler and David Manners are both very attractive people but remain wooden as actors. They didn't seem to improve too much as their careers continued.What elevates this film to classic status is Bela Lugosi and to a lesser extent Karl Freund. Lugosi, while never a great actor, is full of charisma and screen presence. The film livens up whenever he is on screen. As Dracula, he is charming and suave yet completely evil. Simply put, Bela IS Dracula. The cinematography by Karl Freund is dreamlike and adds a lot of haunting atmosphere to the proceedings.

Quite how Dracula impersonations would be these days without this film is hard to think. This film was responsible for the Universal series of horror films, which in turn gave the impetus for Hammer and so on and so forth, but how does the film stand up today? Well it's a mixed bag. On one side you have glorious sets, magnificent atmosphere and great helmsmanship from Tod Browning. On the other hand you have hammy acting, incredibly stilted scenes and some lackadaisical helmsmanship from Tod Browning. The early scenes in Transylvania alone make this film a must see. The atmosphere is lead-heavy with foreboding and Lugosi's first words are electric. However when we move to Britain pace all but disappears as Browning seems to be doing his job while asleep. It becomes very apparent that this is a version of a stage play rather than an adaptation of Stoker's novel and we get too much talk. It's not all bad though, and Browning wakes up occasionally to give a nice set piece or two and the ending is particularly good. To be fair to Tod Browning, talkies were relatively new and they were still struggling to master the new medium. Out of this comes one of my favourite things about this film-the almost total lack of score. This, for me, help a lot with building what suspense there was; rather than the music trying to direct your thoughts, you are left free in the silence to scare yourself (or not, it's your choice!). In fact there are a lot of long silences, which are probably a remnant from the silent days. On the whole a film that must be seen because of its' importance and a very enjoyable one, but maybe not the classic it's remembered to be.

For especially when screened these days, Dracula feels slow and indifferently directed by an uninspired Tod Browning, and it is somewhat of a missed opportunity in so many ways. But it's got one overpowering ingredient that still manages to make it a good - though not excellent - cinematic experience and that's Bela Lugosi - who still remains the definitive version of Count Dracula for all time. As Dracula, Lugosi is methodically sinister and eccentric, speaking deliberately with bizarre intonations and slithering about with an other-worldly gleam in his eye. Though many new viewers tend to find his performance campy or humorous, I'll tell you one thing ... he's suitably creepy. If I ever met this weirdo on a castle stairway, I'd bolt out the door so fast your head would spin! The first 20 minutes are near perfect, even the most vocal detractors tend to acknowledge that. They're completely dripping with a sense of dread and horrific atmosphere. But as the movie progresses, the events indeed become more ponderous, talky and stagy - and it's not always easy to maintain full interest. Dracula was adapted straight from the 1920's stage play (which also starred Lugosi) and it often feels like you're a spectator sitting in the fifth or sixth row. I've seen the film many times myself and there have been times where the leisurely pace has actually worked for me as a deliberate and calculated aura of evil (it was great when I saw it at a revival on the big screen); other times, I am as bored as anyone else. It usually depends on my mood. When Lugosi is on screen, it's pure magic; he becomes Dracula. Dwight Frye is also good as the maniacal Renfield, driven mad by his undead master. Edward Van Sloan makes a fine Professor Van Helsing, and two of the highlights of the later parts of the picture involve the confrontations between Lugosi and Van Helsing meeting face to face. Unfortunately, David Manners and Helen Chandler are not very intriguing as the leads. Though Dracula was a huge success in 1931, today it's not as engrossing as other great horror films which followed the year it was released, like the superior FRANKENSTEIN or DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE; but thanks in large part to the mystique and allure of Bela Lugosi in the title role it's still well worth watching.

For example as most of us know the book starts when Jonathan Harker first visits Count Dracula's castle and in this motion picture adaptation it's Renfield who has the questionable pleasure to be the first one to meet him.Obviously Lugosi Listen to them...children of the night...what music they make isn't really the greatest actor of all times. He's certainly very unique talent and that's what makes him special but he's not a genius. He's splendidly charismatic and therefore a great choice to play this part. His way of talking is weird, Hungarian accent amusing and acting over-theatrical. Dwight Frye was truly excellent as Renfield, his stylish interpretation of this character was just as memorable as Lugosi playing Dracula.This film reminds me more of Mel Brooks' hilarious parody version than Bram Stoker's original novel. Leslie Nielsen's performance was clearly a humble tribute to Lugosi and I can't help the fact that this film looks extremely comical. I know the visual effects are what they are in the early 1930's but honestly are those supposed to be bats...? And what does a couple of armadillos do in the Count's castle? From today's point of view this movie is so filled with funny details I don't know where to start listing.I guess Francis Ford Coppola's dark and violent adaptation of 1992 is just about the only Dracula that doesn't make me laugh.

It's probably unfair to judge it by today's standards, but it's slow going even for a film of its time, and more interesting as a sort of Rorschach for filmgoers, by which I mean if one can sit through and enjoy this film one will probably like old movies; if not, not.As the picture that launched the horror cycle of the thirties, and made a mega-star out of Bela Lugosi, the film does not disappoint in its first twenty minutes or so. The scenes set in Transylvania are obviously back-lot recreations, and rather crude in the bargain, yet for this very reason evocative and creepy, their very stiffness and formality suggest an alernate nightmare reality of the sort young film-makers really ought to study, as no amount of high-tech CGI stuff can do this. It takes real real talent and ingenuity, not tricks, to make a scary movie.Once Renfield travels beyond the Borgo Pass, to Dracula's castle, the movie starts to hum, as the castle's dank and cobwebbed interior is exceedingly uninviting, and one wonders why poor Renfield stays there at all. The quick cutting, from the castle to ship at sea to the arrival in England, is both jarring and surprisingly effective. Once on dry land, though, things get bogged down. The last part of the picture is, alas, the worst, bogged down in melodrama and some very stiff acting.For all this, and the film's genteel conclusion, Dracula is well worth seeing. Lugosi's performance as the Count suggests at times someone in a night school class struggling with an English as a second language course, which is not necessarily wrong for the character, as Dracula is indeed a stranger in a strange land. Helen Chandler's zombie-like and fragile performance suggests that she was in a kind of trance before she met the Count, but no matter, as perhaps this is what appeals to him about her. Dwight Frye's playing of the cackling and vermin-eating Renfield is a triumph, and saves the film's second half from boredom, as the screen catches fire whenever he in on board. Hardly thrilling by today's standards, Dracula none the less has charm to spare; as its slow, ritualized unfolding give various of its key scenes the eerie effect of tableaux, wholly appropriate to the film's intentions.

The acting, in my opinion, was superb, especially Lugosi, who's mere presence was eerie.  The writing and dialogue was very good, making a good balance of drama, horror, and even a little comedy relief.I watched the remastered DVD version of this movie, which gave me the option of hearing new music by Philip Glass and performed by the Chronos Quartet. I must say the new music was great.  It added to the general atmosphere terrifically and set the mood.  The music alone was generally haunting and mixed with the movie fit like a glove.  The print on the DVD was very good quality, considering that the film is from 1931 and the sound quality is excellent.Even as good as it was, there were still flaws, as there are with any movie. The special effects were definitely cheesy.  The bats and spiders were obviously puppets on strings, but again, the fact that it was made in 1931 means that that could be forgiven.  The major problem I had was the ending, which seemed rushed and left a lot hanging.  It left plot elements hanging wide open and it just felt like the movie should have gone on for a few minutes more to tie everything up.Dracula is definitely an awesome movie well worth all of its praise and lives up to expectations even 70 years later.

It has never had a particularly high critical reputation; most scholars find it a laboured and static attempt at Grand Guignol which bypasses the more gothic elements of Bram Stoker's novel in favour of winding sheet melodrama. One doesn't have to accept that verdict to see that they have a point. Dracula survives better as a museum piece than as a horror film. Bearing in mind that it was this film which gave the horror film mass acceptance in the English speaking world, it has a certain significance. But one can sense Tod Browning treading lightly, as if uncertain about what sort of film he wanted to make.My main concern about the film is its lack of pace. Their is little flow to it. Individual scenes stand out as set pieces, but they rarely seem to relate to each other. It is not really the fault of the actors, who even at their hammiest deliver surprisingly strong and committed performances. Lugosi is a standout of course, but equally good are Helen Chandler as Mina and Dwight Frye as Renfield. Karl Freund's cinematography is miraculous, if erratic.The new Phillip Glass score is a matter of controversy judging by other reviews, but I for one found it to be the missing link that restores Dracula to its full powers. Glass picks up the pace in a film that badly needs it. He underlines the characterisations in a fashion that is perceptive and compelling. The mournful yet sinister motif that accompanies Lugosi adds a whole new dimension; Renfield's pizzicato motif likewise delineates the character.Since I am no great fan of Maestro Glass, nobody is more surprised than myself at this assessment.  I frankly approached this newly scored version with a certain amount of dread. But I watched the film in one sitting this afternoon, something that I have never been able to do before, and for the first time found it to be rivetting cinema throughout, and not just in snatches.

Yet, I was forced to watch it since it was my sister's night to pick a movie for the family to see. Being a big vampire-werewolf fan she picked this movie, which would be alright for me since I'm a huge old Hollywood fan and I enjoy watching old movies. Well, I enjoy watching old movies just not this one. To begin, I found it interesting that while the story takes place in the 1800s, the people all wore 1930s clothing, making them look out of place with the setting. Different idea (one that upset my sister might I add) but not terrible. Then we go to Dracula's castle. I have to say, I couldn't stand Dracula's accent. It was to apparent and it seemed like Bela Lugosi was trying to hard. Then again, actors back in the 1930s did overact most of the time. Renfield, the poor guy who visits Dracula, then walks through a spider web. Dracula says he has a small spider going around. Small!? That web was huge! Looks like the spider who made it could eat a small dog! Dracula then took Renfield to his room for the night, which Dracula gives a long and awkward speech about. He then takes Renfield's suitcases and goes to another room. The door opens by itself! If I was Renfield, I would be scared. What door opens by itself? By the end of the night, Renfield becomes Dracula's slave so it really doesn't matter. Dracula and Renfield go to England aboard a ship and Renfield is found and put into a mental institution. Not a good one might I add. Renfield escapes like ten times! A bunch of other weird things happen throughout the movie, might I add but I don't feel like adding them. However, I will mention the funniest part. When Mina is visited by the bat, you can see the string the fake bat is on! Come on! And it doesn't even move! What the heck? After watching the movie, I was relieved. But, here's the thing about old movies that I've learned. You can't judge it on the year you're watching it in, but on the year it came out. And I guess for the year it came out in, 1931, it was good. I mean, brilliant since I read afterwords that when people first saw it, some fainted in horror. I almost did too.

Dracula is possibly the most iconic horror film of all time. It had amazing line delivery by Bela Lugosi, the sets were grandiose and gloomy, and it single-handedly brought about the beginning of the Universal monster movie. When you think of a vampire movie, or Dracula in general, you think of the 1931 movie, with Lugosi's thick Hungarian accent, long, flowing cap, and dark hair with a prominent widow's peak. It's really too bad that this movie is so terribly boring. The introduction of the characters Renfield and Dracula are probably the highlight of the film. Besides the climax of the film, the pace is dismal. It seems that a lot of these horror films are plagued by this problem and this movie is certainly no exception.

Its primary source of inspiration was a 1924 stage play loosely based on the novel. Renfield (Dwight Frye) finds himself Transylvania to finalize the sale of Carfax Abby to Count Dracula, who the locals believe (correctly) is a vampire. Despite their desperate warnings, Renfield continues on to Castle Dracula, where he is enslaved and made insane by the vampiric count. They make their way to England, where Dracula sets his appetite on Mina (Helen Chandler). It's up to her fianc√© (David Manners), her father (Herbert Bunston) and the illustrious Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan).Produced in 1931 - shortly after the advent of sound (1927) - this early talkie bears the marks of its technological limitations. Non-diagetic sound (such as background music) is entirely absent from the film (save for the excerpt from Swan Lake that's played over the opening credits). While this sets the grave tone of the film, it leaves something missing to the contemporary viewer (which is why I would recommend the version of the film that features an astounding score by Philip Glass).Likewise, the acting is non-stylistically stiff; actors tend to not move around very much while speaking (due to the difficulty in capturing their dialog at the time). While this might add to the effect of the count being an upper-class gentleman, it mostly just prevents the actors from getting too into their roles.That said, however, the film features the finest early-sound acting I've yet to see. Bela Lugosi is absolutely hypnotic as Dracula, adding a romantic charm to the character that Max Shreck (Count Orlok in 1922's Nosferatu) could never give to the role. He presents a suave, sophisticated killer that, unlike Orlok, can blend into a society (both attending the theater and earning social invitations). As such, Lugosi's Dracula is a much more covert threat than his cinematic predecessor. Edward Van Sloan gives a terse performance as the stoic Professor Van Helsing, foiling Dracula's seductive charisma with reserved tones and jilting movement. The scene in which both characters square off against one another is the most memorable in the film.Dwight Frye positively scene-stealing as Renfield. He is able to articulate the proper young Victorian gent while also expressing his deepest levels of insanity later in the film. His wild-eyed stares (set against his maddening laughter) surpasses even Lugosi's own hypnotic close-ups. Despite playing the third-banana character, Frye gives the film's most unsettling and memorable performance.Enough cannot be set for the film's art direction as, aside from Frankenstein (1931), it gives us the most singularly enchanting settings of the decade. Castle Dracula is filled with vivid Gothic detail and lush extravagance. The stone stairwell where Dracula greets Renfield is haunting, even by today's standards. Standing in stark contrast to the decrepit ruins of the castle is the manor of Dr. Seward (Mina's father), which is clean, bright and modern (standing as the cultural foil of Dracula's Old World origins).While contemporary viewers might find the action a bit tame and the lack of background music a little frustrating, this canonical film deserves its status in the popular mindset. Fans of classic horror (1931-1941), vampires and the incredible creative talents that worked on this feature will find little to dislike with Dracula.

Movies during this time didn't use much realistic violence, but I feel that the film could have used more gore.

There is no color, almost no romance, and the sets are a tad dull, but the audience will be more terrified by the effects of this movie than anything, which is what a movie should be able to do. The lighting was superb whenever the camera was on Bela Lugosi. The light in and around his eyes and nothing else gave the audience the sense of true and pure evil. The movie created an oxymoron in the light. Light is supposed to represent goodness and safety, but with the light on Dracula's eyes, the audience felt no such security. While lights helped to magnify the horror of the of the movie, the way Reinfeld stared became just as unnerving. There is something about insanity and craziness to an audience that frightens them even more. Perhaps it is not being able to understand what is going through their mind, but as audience members, we knew exactly what was going through Reinfeld's mind. Truly a subtly horrifying movie.

Quite a lot, I reckon, judging by the 7.7 out of 10 this one enjoyed in August 2010. The fact is this isn't a 7.7 film &#x96; it's a 5.5 to 6.0 film at best. Back in 1931 it caused a sensation in the States, but when you look back at the vastly superior Nosferatu, made nearly a decade earlier, you have to wonder why audiences thought it was so terrific.The film does start with some appropriately atmospheric scenes &#x96; particularly the ones in Dracula's cellar with the low-vaulted ceiling and the three brides awakening from their daylight sleep. Bela Lugosi looks elegant in a slight dissolute way, but is as far removed from the vampire Nosferatu (and Bram Stoker's image of him) as you could imagine. Nevertheless, his appearance here served as the template for all vampires right through to the eighties. He never blinks, apparently, and director Tod Browning often focuses on this unblinking gaze to good effect.The story, however, moves as fast as a one-legged man in a sea of molasses. Professor van Helsing, who looks more like a cuddly old uncle than his last incarnation as vampire hunter cum action hero, spends too much of his time talking about the fate that befalls anyone who comes under Dracula's control rather than actually doing anything about it, and the horrific element of the film amounts to a few shots of Lugosi closing in on a sleeping maiden's throat - hardly enough to give you nightmares. It's left to Dwight Frye, giving the performance of his career as the ill-fated Renfield, to inject some life into the story, but sadly he can't prevent the film from showing its age.

But when all is said and done, there is only one Dracula, and that is Bela Lugosi. His Dracula portrayal is classic.Dracula, after all, is one of the undead, and the pasty look of Lugosi, coupled with his theatricality (one might say hamminess), pretty much defines the character.Dracula has its moments. The brief scene with his brides (it's a shame they didn't get a little sexier here. This was after all, pre-code Hollywood). Dwight Frye as the pathetic Reinfeld gives an inspired demented performance.Unfortunately, for all of its visual style, this original Dracula bores me. But there's been something wrong with just about every version of Dracula ever made.Possibly delivering the horror (and the sexual theme) most adroitly is Hammer Film's Horror of Dracula in 1958. Christoper Lee makes a terrifying count. But, for one who is undead, Lee's Dracula is a creature of immense strength and powerful libido. In short, he's a far cry from anyone looking undead.Frank Langella's virile Dracula features a vampire with a George Hamilton tan. There are some eerie moments in this Dracula, but Frank is simply too studly to be believed as one of the undead.Gary Oldham's 1992 take in Bram Stoker's Dracula was amusing to me. Forget any of the legends of the vampire, Gary's count can walk around in daylight, but only if he wears his Foster Grants.I recall Jack Palance doing a television performance of the count. Frankly, I can't really remember it very well.The vampire myth is wonderfully spooky. I remember when I was a kid, I wanted to be a rock star. Nowadays, kids want to grow up to be vampires. The myth has a powerful hold on our subconscious that no other monster has. A vampire is pretty much sex and death in one fell swoop.The story has been done to death and the many vampire movies are for the most part silly. I have too much respect for the original book (which, by the way, is even more boring than Lugosi's movie) to see the classic story done comically and with so much license taken with the real legend.I must confess a liking for Nosferatu the Vampire with Klaus Kinski. This has Kinski looking quite like the original Nosferatu. There is much humor, which for me works.I have the restored version of the original Nosferatu on tape but I have not viewed it as yet. Even the edited version of this silent seems spookier than Lugosi's.But as I am a purist, and an ancient one at that, my first glimpse of the character of Count Dracula was at a young age when the TV networks would slip in a horror movie before the six o'clock news. And it was the face of Lugosi that was indelibly imprinted in my mind as Dracula. Too bad that every time I watch it, I do get dulled by the movie's talkiness. "},{"Title":"Listen to them.

This fact, combined with Browning's rather naive direction (cinema was in its infancy, the art of storytelling was still evolving, and some shots are extremely clumsy), plus a noticeable lack of soundtrack, makes Dracula an often embarrassingly dated affair that is hard to take seriously at times.Thank heavens for the superb Gothic atmosphere, impressive set designs, a few classic lines guaranteed to warm the heart of any avid horror geek (Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make.), and a chilling turn from Dwight Frye as Dracula's loyal slave Renfield, all of which go to ensure that, even though the film isn't the flawless masterpiece many claim it to be, it still offers enough for fans of vintage horror to enjoy.After all, if the cinematography, acting, and direction fail to impress, there's always the rubber bats, vampire wasp (?!?!), clockwork spider and family of Transylvanian armadillos to keep the viewer amused.

One is that Renfield is a moron for ignoring the villagers' pleas for him to stay off the Borgo Pass on Walpurgisnacht. Dah CASTLE? Castle DRAH-coo-la???? Why take chances? Especially when Renfield notices that his carriage has no driver and the horses are being led by a bat. Isn't THAT reason enough to bail out? Then there's the castle itself. I frankly admire the decor and maintenance of the interior. It's got genuine atmosphere, not the fake atmosphere of, say, the Taj Mahal Motel in Los Angeles or the Kansas City Tiki.But the surroundings and the host are spooky enough that when Count Dracula says, I am Dracula. I bid you velcome. And, Da spider -- spinnink his vamp faw da unvary fly. Da blood is da LIFE, Meester Renfield, that would do the job for most people.But then Renfield is a little peculiar to begin with, if you ask me. An effete wimpy character, shorter than anyone else in the film, ladies included. And offered that drugged wine by Dracula. I feel the same protective way towards him as I do towards Janet Leigh when she's stepping naked into the shower in Psycho. No matter how many times I've seen it I always want to shout out a warning. Janet Leigh was a canny and determined woman, whereas Renfield seems to earn a kind of Darwinian extinction for his wanton trust.What a weird flick. It moves with lethal slowness. I don't mean the pace is slack or that anything lasts too long. I mean that the dialog and the action within scenes seem to take place at almost glacial tempo. The only abrupt motions are when Dracula jerks away from wolf bane or a crucifix or slaps a mirror out of Van Helsing's hands. Now if this were a comedy, or anything other than a horror film, that deliberate pace would be the kiss of death. But it suits Dracula. Things, even the most awful, strike us as taking place in slow motion the way they sometimes do in a dream -- not just a nightmare but an oneiristic catastrophe.I don't think anyone could have handled the part of Dracula as well as Lugosi. There is his cadaverous makeup, for one thing, and his manner -- always polite, always smiling, reeking of moral corruption. And his speech! God, it's exquisite! The rhythm, the pauses, the inflections that inform his lines. In a battle of wills, he points his curled and claw-like fingers towards Van Helsing and says, Come here. When Van Helsing hesitates Lugosi extends his arm, lowers his voice, and commands him, Come . . . HER. (Her, not here.) I don't know whether these stylistic touches were witting or not on Lugosi's part because, as I understand it, he learned to speak English phonetically for his first performances. At any rate he gives his lines the most curious contours heard on any screen.The whole movie is really an exercise in style because the plot doesn't make any sense. Example. Is Renfield turned into a vampire or no? If not, why does he thirst only for blood, even if it's the blood of flies? If so, why does he run around in the daytime and how does Dracula kill him? Well, as long as we're asking questions, what are armadillos and possums doing in the basement of Dracula's castle in Transylvania? And what did Dracula and his wives eat between visits from English real estate brokers? I wondered the same thing about mosquitoes once when I was in muskeg country in the Yukon, a hundred miles or more from the nearest large warm blooded animal, and found the place was swarming with them.I must add too that I didn't care much for the way Count Dracula managed his menage in Transylvania. There were at least three wives, which is not a bad idea in itself, but he treated them pretty shabbily, shooing them away from Renfield's unconscious body so he could get first dibs. Did he leave them behind? At least one of them because as he says to Renfield, I am only taking vit me three, uh -- boxes. I just watched the DVD with the score by Philip Glass, all strings, and all his usual repetitiveness. Glass may over-score the film a little but it's better than the original, and it's in 5.1.If you haven't seen this yet, you must. And don't get into a battle of wills with me. It's for your own good. Dracula has become part of our vernacular culture and if you don't know it, you'll miss some great stuff that will crop up in various contexts from time to time. I never drink -- vine.

Lugosi's stilted, Hungarian accent delivers the film's best lines, such as 'I am Dracula...I bid you welcome', and 'I never drink...wine'. It is a creaky, theatrical performance, but a startlingly effective one just the same. Two pencil-spot-lights were aimed at Lugosi's eyes to increase the intensity of his hypnotic stare, and it is a lethal one indeed.Lugosi's performance is also slightly seductive- there is something strangely sexy about those swishing capes and thirst for blood. I believe Stoker intended the character to have that effect in his 1897 novel, and Browning and Lugosi convey the attraction here. After all, isn't Dracula representative of what we all supposedly lust after- eternal life? Religious imagery abounds in this production, with Lugosi's 'seduction' of Frye revolving around an offering of bread and wine. Lugosi also shirks away at the sight of a cross. It is interesting to note that Lugosi's 'taking' of Frye's character almost didn't make it to the screen. Censors considered it too openly suggestive and homo-erotic, yet the scene remains intact today despite many clumsy edits being applied to the film.Dwight Frye, best known for his role as the dim-witted Fritz in Frankenstein (1931) plays another sidekick here as Renfield, and, like Lugosi, it is a role he was born to play. The pair provide most of the film's classic moments (and a homo-erotic subtext), along with Edward Van Sloan as Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing. Chandler and Manners are attractive as the young lovers, yet their wooden performances rival the stake plunged through Dracula's heart.The mood and tone achieved by Browning makes the film a classic- the visuals are superb. Shadowy lighting, swirling fog, crawling possums (Yes, not rats-possums! Censors considered rats a no-no), cobwebs and passages of sinister silence where things are seen and not heard build this to an intensity rarely seen in modern horror films.Dracula's Transylvanian castle and 'undead' brides provide one of the most memorable moments in film- the zombie-like females walking (or is it floating?) to a collapsed Renfield, only to be gestured away by their master.The Universal Special Edition DVD is a treat to watch, as we learn of some fascinating trivia. One wonders, after hearing the commentary, about supposed'horror genius' Browning's overall contribution to the product. There are some strange, stilted scenes that appear to have no direction. Most notably, Lugosi is photographed terribly (he looks more like a midget than an imposing vampire) in one particular shot, a piece of cardboard barely obscures a light, and Manners seems to be standing around waiting for something to happen in many a scene. The footage of a ship flailing wildly at sea was actually taken from a silent film, so that accounts for the jerkiness in one shot.It's said that the Spanish version is technically superior, but that may well be because censorship didn't apply to non-domestic product from Universal. An important chapter in film history, and an entertaining one, too.

This 1931 Dracula isn't nearly as viscerally scary--gone are the rats climbing about his feet, the excessively long and pointy fingernails and the bat-like face. In its place is a pretty sophisticated and cultured Bela Lugosi. While not exactly a sex symbol, but by comparison to Orlock, he was quite the stud!

In spite of this, it suffers from awkwardly jerky plot shifts (including a gap between Renfield's sanity loss, and an ending that leaves MUCH to be desired), scenes of draggy exposition, special effects that seem laughable by today's standards (the pin-light shining when Lugosi gives 'the evil eye' is distracting to no end), and coy neck-bites. That being said, the sheer beauty of this film and the skill with which it's executed IS periodically hypnotizing, and Lugosi is relatively good as the undead Count.

This, however, is the ONLY area where it can lay a claim to be better in when compared to the US version (the fact that leading lady Lupita Tovar had a sexier wardrobe than Helen Chandler shouldn't even be considered, I guess). Still, the fact that on the DVD the opinion that the seminal US version is the inferior one seems to be shared by quite a few people hasn't done it any favors! I remember being impressed by the Spanish version when I first watched it in 2001, singling out for praise the performance of Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield and, of course, George Robinson's cinematography. However, coming back to it now, I felt that Rubio's hysterical rendering of the character (which reminded me of Gene Wilder in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN 1974 of all people!) was nowhere nearly as nuanced as Dwight Frye's unforgettable characterization in the US version. Regarding the superior camera-work, I guess this is true for individual sequences (Dracula's introduction, for instance) but, frankly, I never felt that Karl Freund - a pioneer of the moving camera - had somehow been restrained by Tod Browning, who admittedly wasn't very fond of this technique. Given that of late we've also been faced by the ridiculous assumption that Browning didn't actually direct the film, he couldn't have - since he wasn't even there!! It may be however, that since frequent Browning collaborator Lon Chaney (who had been slated for the title role) died before shooting began, the director sort of lost heart in the project - coupled also with the fact that the script was rather talky, another element with which Browning felt uneasy! Well, whatever went on behind the scenes, for me what's in front remains one of the highlights of the American horror film - from the marvelous dialogue (especially as delivered - each in their own unique way - by Lugosi, Frye and Edward Van Sloan), irreproachable performances (Frye and Van Sloan were at their best, while Lugosi only ever really came close with THE BLACK CAT 1934 and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN 1939) and memorable individual scenes (the entire first act set in Transylvania, the confrontation scenes between Dracula and his nemesis Professor Van Helsing, Renfield's various ravings). The tame ending may appear anti-climactic to most people but I honestly was never bothered by it! If anything, this was remedied in any number of ways in subsequent outings...Which brings us back to the Spanish Dracula like I said, the film is an interesting and altogether pleasing 'alternate' to the Lugosi version...but it is fatally compromised by the inadequate leading performance of Carlos Villarias, whose bulging eyes and feral snarls can't hold a candle to Lugosi's definitive screen vampire! This version does go to places where the American doesn't (Browning shies away from the vampire attacks, for instance) and even features 'new' scenes like the aftermath of the vampiric Lucy's demise - but, at 104 minutes (a full half-hour longer than the US version, when considering that they were following the same script!) it's way overlong for its own good. The Browning/Lugosi version is often criticized for its sluggishness but this one actually moves at a snail's pace take, for instance, the famous scene where Dracula is exposed by the mirror - Lugosi knocks the box down immediately, while Villarias takes forever to do so (even if his resolution is effectively flamboyant nonetheless).A word about the DVD quality disappointingly, the Spanish version features closed-captions (for the hearing-impaired) rather than proper subtitles. As for the US version, the print utilized for this particular transfer (which differs from that of the original, and more satisfactory, 1999 release) is a bit too dark for my taste and the dialogue sometimes was hard to catch due to the incessant hiss on the soundtrack! It also reverts to the 'original' single groan during Dracula's staking (instead of the elongated variant available on the earlier disc)...but does feature a bit of music at the end of the Opera sequence, which had been missing from the previous edition!! Well, this only means that it's worth keeping both copies of Dracula as neither is really definitive...

His conversations with other people (in trying to hide the fact that he was who he was) was even silly at times, because he seemed ages ahead of where they were at. The whole movie circled around his role, and he performed it fantastically, giving many generations the best Dracula of them all, without even showing fangs, or biting anyone.

Nor, is there taking the place of Bela Lugosi in his definitive role as the Count, although Carlos Villar isn't bad in the Spanish Language version (Sorry, but Christopher Lee isn't even in the competition in my book!). For the opening credits, Tod Browning used a drawing of a bat with glaring eyes under the credits. Innovative and in 1931 was probably something shocking (especially, on the big screen). In the Spanish language version, George Melford used the traditional haunted house-type of opening credits with candle and cobwebs. Nice, but cobwebs were already common in horror films when it was made; the 1927 version of The Cat and The Canary, for example. Both openings do work well on different levels, though. The supporting cast in both films is a matter of opinion. In the Lugosi version, Helen Chandler, David Manners, and Dwight Frye all look like Anglo-Saxons of London society. But, pretty Chandler and handsome Manners are just so hammy (she gave just as bad of a performance in the previous years Outward Bound, he improved later on in The Black Cat). However, Frye is superb as the lunatic, Renfield. In the Villar version Lupita Tovar and Barry Norton are just bland as the heroine and hero and Pablo Alverez Rubio is sometimes unintentionally hilarious as Renfield (the look on his face as he gets bumped around during the carriage ride to Dracula's castle is an absolute howl)! It's also worthy to mention Frances Dade and Carmen Guerrero who play Lucy (Lucia) in the two films and who both give good performances. Cinematography-wise, what one film accomplishes the other one doesn't and vice versa. Count Dracula's castle on the cliff top with the shore below is a delight in Villar's version as is the tracking shot of Renfield's first glimpse of the Count. Dracula's raising from his coffin is better in the Villar version until the third time that he does it (where it becomes boring and irritatingly repetitive). However, Dracula's walk through the giant spider web is so much more eerie in Lugosi's version (in Villar's version we just don't get the impact of him passing through the web nor do we clearly get to see the look of horror on Renfield's face). Lucy's night prowl is scarier in Lugosi's film because we can plainly see that it is the dead Lucy walking as if she were in a trance. In Villar's film, Lucia is photographed from too far away and one might easily confuse her for Mina. Dracula's smashing of the cigarette box is done better in Lugosi's version (Villar is just too over the top when he takes a swipe at it with his walking stick) and Renfield's demise is better staged in the Lugosi version. Too bad that greedy Universal Pictures brass got to chop the Lugosi version down to a scant 75 minutes running time so that they could book more daily showings. Greed, greed, greed! As a result, things that are never clearly defined in Lugosi's version are defined in Villar's version ( Van Helsing's origin and arrival to London and the reason why he must remain in the Abbey for awhile at the end, etc.). It would be great if someday Universal Studios could find the missing footage from Lugosi's Dracula, restore the film to its original running length and put it onto DVD for us!

Full of the always excellent atmosphere found in the Universal pictures, the lack of musical accompaniment doesn't seem to hinder this film much. If anything, the silence adds to the eeriness of the whole affair.Edward Van Sloan lends his usual professionalism as Professor Van Helsing, the nemesis of the undead Count. His face-offs with Lugosi, in the mirror scene & the test of wills are just a few of my favorite moments from the movie.Dwight Frye (in his defining role) is excellent as the crazed, pitiable Renfield. Fans always make mention of his crazed laughter, but is there a better manic scream in all of cinema than the one Frye cuts loose with when Van Helsing shows him the wolfbane (You know too much to live Van Helsing). Another favorite Renfield/Van Helsing scene comes later when Renfield goes Dracula! shakes uncontrollably.....Why I never even heard the name.Dracula is not without its faults, though. The ending sequence with the demise of Dracula & the photogenic pair of David Manners and Helen Chandler walking up the stairs with the abrupt cut to the closing The End is totally flat. The entire scene feels like Tod Browning was on cruise control before he decided to mash down hard on the brakes & leave you with that feeling of Huh, that's it? Shouldn't there be more? And what was the deal with the camera panning away as Lugosi rose from his coffin. You'd hear a creak, then the camera just pans over to a wall then back to Bela standing upright. Did some higher-up at Universal think 1931 audiences couldn't handle seeing a man rising out of his casket?!?Overall, the film is still great viewing and the image of Lugosi's glowing eyes will live on through the ages.

However, this film is not without it's flaws. In fact, they're quite numerous. But an excellent set design and Bela Lugosi's performance are really what make this film what it is.The acting in this movie hits a very wide spectrum, and ranges from brilliant to terrible, although mostly staying within the realm of average. Bela Lugosi, who plays Dracula, gives and absolutely classic performance in this movie. His accent is perfect, and his slow, steady and very deliberate deliverance of his lines are flawless. He captures the essence of Dracula, the very core of evil.Dwight Frye, however, was terrible. He gives, easily, one of the worst and over-acted performances that has ever been captured on film. Everything he does is so over-the-top that it ruins the character. He so obviously tries to act crazy that he just comes off as laughable on screen.The rest of the acting was rather average. Edward van Sloan, who plays Van Helsing, gives the only other memorable above-average performance in this movie. He knows his character, and portrays him as he should be, a little underacted while still giving off a commanding presence.The direction of this film is atrocious. The shots that are meant to be serious are comical, the ones that should be horrific barely manage to touch the viewer. A ridiculous amount of time is devoted to Lugosi's eyebrows, and seriously subtracts from this film. If James Whale, instead of Tod Browning, had directed this movie I have no doubt that it would rank at least a full point higher. As it stands, though, the direction does nothing but get into the film's way.The set designs are simply superb. Count Dracula's castle is powerful and atmospheric. While it's not as the book describes it, it does much to add to the film's tone and charm. The Harker's home has a wonderful classic touch to it, and looks just as one would expect a Victorian estate to look; impeccable, proper and richly decorated.Except for the beginning, there is no musical score in the entire movie. I'm inclined to think that this might be, perhaps, due to it being 1931 (only four years since the first sound motion picture, The jazz Singer). After watching Frankenstein (1931), I'm even more sure of this. But this is still one of the film's greatest downfalls. The utter silence throughout the entire film brings focus to every excruciating little detail throughout, and brings out every flaw and every imperfection. Every moment stretches exponentially, and every minor defect is exaggerated more than it should be. If you get the opportunity, watch this movie with Philip Glass' modern score rendition for this movie. It smooths the entire film over and raises it to a new level.This is a movie that every horror fan and fan of classic movies should watch. In fact, this is one of the movies that I feel that has become so ingrained into our culture, that has become such a pillar of film-making, everybody should see it at least once in their lifetime.

Once upon a time Dracula, the stage play, was a sensation that starred BELA LUGOSI as the blood-thirsty man in the cape who thrilled theater audiences with his chilling portrayal. He's still chilling in the screen version Tod Browning directed and there's plenty of creepy atmosphere to keep you riveted to the story.But there are also plenty of faults. The opening scenes are a lot more cinematic than what follows once we leave the castle and the story starts dealing with Mina (HELEN CHANDLER) and Jonathan Harker (DAVID MANNERS) at their residence. It then becomes almost completely stagebound, with static movement of story and characters so that you know you're watching a museum piece from the '30s. The horror is so diluted by the stagey slow-talking dialog (sound was new and actors were told to keep their speeches slow so every word could be heard). It's an almost silent acting approach to the whole thing.BELA LUGOSI is very menacing in his huge close-ups but is guilty of stage acting all the way through. DWIGHT FRYE makes a very intense and enjoyable Renfield, although he too is guilty of extravagant overacting by today's standards.The cobweb atmosphere is dark and appropriately scary and the B&W lensing of the story is very impressive. But, as stated above, you have to take it for what it is--a primitive telling of the great story handicapped by its faithfulness to the stage version.It ends rather abruptly as Harker and Mina ascend the stairs and Van Helsing tells them he'll be along soon. Fadeout. The End. Much too abrupt. Modern audiences are bound to feel cheated by the less than thrilling ending.Summing up Flaws and all, still an interesting experience mainly because Lugosi and Frye keep it watchable.

The list of films set in Romania without Dracula was surprisingly extensive(and there are still several I haven't seen)and also surprisingly good. But now it's time to review film's featuring his excellency the Count, and where better to start off than with the version that is the most firmly implanted in the public's consciousness?In my now infamous review of the 1931 James Whale 'Frankenstein'(which still garnishes hate-mail on a weekly basis from enraged Branagh fans just as effectively as the original version I posted on my old account back in 2002 did)I emphasized just what a polarizing film it can be. In contrast, Tod Browning's less-highly regarded Dracula isn't so much a film with multiple opinions regarding it so much as it is a film whose reviewers are invariably split into two camps 1)Those who regard it as an important but unwatchable curio and 2)Those who love it unconditionally whose only complaints(if any) are that it's pacing slows down after the early scenes in Romania.But films, as with life, are too complex to be summed up that easily. So the truth is that while it has a number of strengths and weaknesses, they aren't nearly as strong OR weak as they are made out. The consensus is that the film goes to hell as soon as it leaves Transylvania; and while it's true that nothing else in the film quite measures up to those scenes in becoming iconic, the film actually has several of it's most effective sequences right after wards The scenes of the 'Vesta' being found with the entire crew dead except a raving Renfield still provides a real jolt, the scenes of Dracula seducing and then coming upon Lucy are still creepy enough to make you occasionally open an eye after you've gone to bed as well, but only if the atmosphere is JUST right.While it is true that a lack of a musical score mars the film, it also manages to give several scenes an eerie feel that makes it seem as if time itself has stopped to allow the Count to do his deadly handiwork. Everything feels dead, with only Dracula himself moving about. They don't call midnight(when Dracula apparently strikes)the 'Dead of Night' for nothing. The oft-criticized scenes where things are kept off camera actually work FOR the film rather than against it, and likely are sparing us some scenes that would otherwise be embarrassing. There's no denying that 'Dracula' is slow and dull, and that this pacing technique(not helped by static camera-work) fails more often than it succeeds; but compared to some other glacially-paced horrors of this era that I've had the misfortune to witness, it's nothing to gripe about.The acting is quite different from most people's reviews too. The consensus is that Lugosi is the only competent actor on board and everyone else stinks. The truth is, in fact, the opposite. Lugosi has an undeniable screen-presence, the most hypnotic eyes I have ever seen in a human being who was not a woman, and he created a character that will be remembered when the dust of my bones is gone; but the truth is that he's so hammy he's embarrassing, and his delivery(We'll be lee--avink, to-MORRRRROW--eve-enink)is the subject of too many parodies too count that it was probably old-hat to mock it before the year was out. This is no slam on Lugosi, I've sat through too many bad films just to see him in minor roles for me NOT to be a fan, but he's done better than this, even in comedies like 'Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein'.The unfairly reviled supporting cast is actually quite good all things considered. Herbert Bunston gives a credible, if one-dimensional portrayal of Dr. Seward. Frances Dade is very natural as Lucy but sadly has too little screen time to develop the character. Helen Chandler is incredibly dull as Mina and deserves most of the barbs she gets, BUT; she does have one great moment where she attempts to bite Jonathan Harker(David Manners, who IS every bit as bad as critics have said)with this evil little gleam in her eye. It could be made into a shirt featuring the 7 deadly sins and 'Lust' would apply perfectly to it. Still, it would have been better if her role was reversed with Lucy's. Most of the film is carried by Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing. He seems to be just an old man, but his sheer stoicism and drive is astonishing. He may not be a quasi-superhero like Peter Cushing or Hugh Jackman, but you really believe in everything he says. He may seem unassuming, but rarely has Dracula had such a worthy foe.But the real standout is Dwight Frye as Renfield. His transformation from an unassuming everyman hero, to mad slave, to fiend, to martyr is absolutely incredible. He's both charming and likable in his naivet√© in the early scenes, horrifyingly deranged when he goes mad(his laugh is the scariest thing about the film), hilariously funny(he provides more real comedy than any of the comedy relief maids and guards)and ultimately, a very tragic character. One could argue that he is the true hero of the film. His death at Dracula's hands is genuinely heartbreaking. The fact that Frye was never nominated for something shows just how meaningless industry awards really are.So no, 'Dracula' is not a masterpiece, nor is it an overrated misfire only important for historic reasons with only one good performance. It still remains essential viewing for every horror fan worth his salt and should be seen at least once by any self-respecting film fan.Just try not to expect a classic in league with 'Frankenstein'.~ "}{"Title":"thin-blooded","Date":"20 July 2004","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Dracula is often hailed as a red-blooded horror classic, when in point of fact it's dull as dishwater.

With this landmark production Marnau created an extremely chilling piece of cinema which contained some genuinely spooky images. Nine years later Hollywood sanitized the whole concept and came out with Lugosi's painfully slow and almost comical remake.Today, this sleepy old clunker is, in all honesty, only of interest as an historical curiosity. It moves along with all the pace of a funeral procession (appropriately enough). The dialogue regularly stops for long periods and with nothing much happening on the screen to fill the void you'll find yourself glancing over at the video shelf to consider other options.The almost total lack of incidental music throughout the picture also doesn't help the situation. Bela pulls his usual collection of rather idiotic facial expressions most of which will lead you to believe that he's just spotted something nasty on the carpet.As far as being a viable source of entertainment for contemporary audiences I'm afraid that this movie has long since joined the majority of Dracula's unfortunate victims in the ranks of the Living Dead.

The one truly outstanding aspect of this version is Bela Lugosi and his hypnotic stare. His face is wonderful. His presence is obvious. He is the star of the show.

The Vampire has kept his place in society as a large phenomena that has remained omnipresent in media outlets. In recent years, we've had Twlight split a nation between Team Jacob and Team Edward (the vampire), tweens and their mothers alike. We have the Vampire Diaries keeping a steady following over the past 7 years, spawning a spin off, the Originals, that has also retained outstanding ratings over the past 3 years. Along with countless remakes and direct references to the man, the myth, the legend, the Vampire himself, Dracula; and his scientific adversary Van Helsing 85 years later. Tod Browning's black and white film left room for powerful use of light, photography, and sound helped the film be taken in the way that it was, causing it's overwhelming success. At some parts, the light is so low key that the shot is nearly black, only having a pair of eye's illuminated, This added to Dracula's looming presence, being more impactive on the viewer, they feel they are being watched themselves. The photography is key, frequently; it shows reaction of the characters to what is occurring or in front of them in a quick jump cut or reverse shot. And because of the mis-en-scene that is created, the diegetic sounds that are heard are all the more jarring and can be felt in one's core.

The film is empty in a strange way. The film abounds with metaphysics at the expense of physics. I can not imagine such a horror in today's conditions. I think the director is not particularly bothered. Sound and special effects are beautifully evoked, but not innovative at all. But he created a classic that is not a bad movie.The first part of the film is quite interesting. The phenomenon of Dracula is amazing. Counts castle looks really creepy, but the real horror is missing. The camera is slow and framing are not very good.The second part of the film goes into slow play situations, which every now and then interrupted some horror moment. All material Production and costume design, elements of metamorphosis, disgust of the Cross, invisible in the mirror wrapped in a dark appearance of the character of Count Dracula in the chamber atmosphere from which he emerges from his coffin; all this was raised to the top level by omitting the use of music and Gothic sounds, creaking, rustling, twisting wind and the howling of wolves. Everything that develops, runs silent, the cold conversation that alternate with the image darkness and dense social flirting and compliments.Bela Lugosi (Count Dracula) is such a great character. However, his acting is quite questionable. The appearance is amazing, but what comes after that is pretty empty. I am one of the few who considered his performance as average. I wonder how he felt Lugosi because he did not excel in the role of life.Dwight Frye (Reinfield) is disgusting, sycophant and loyal subordinate toddler who eats flies and vermin. Frye saved movie. Its performance is considered as excessive. I think that his performance is excellent. Watching this film is really tempting. The film will not appeal to everyone, especially not to a wide audience.

Well, Dracula is interesting, Reinfield was probably my favorite as he had the most interesting story in my opinion. Their was a couple of other characters that I thought were interesting. All the other characters were OK, I can not really remember much about them other that they were there.The creepiness in this movie is very good, the lack of almost any music is both good and bad. It sometimes helps with the suspense and creep factor, but it can make for pretty odd moments and might make some people laugh or smile. But then again, you can watch the 1999 version that has its own score.Their were a few flaws in this movie. As I mentioned before the lack of music is a double edged sword. Some of the characters were not really explored at all, they were simply there to be scared. The run time could have been longer to explore the characters more and flesh out some of the scenes. Also, the editing was a bit weird at times, it would jump from one location to the other.

For years, silent films only had visuals to tell their story, so already the art of matte painting used as backgrounds had been implemented successfully. So as Renfield (Dwight Frye) makes his way by carriage through the Universal films backlot, it is transformed, very impressively, into Transylvania! The first words spoken are from Carla Laemmle, niece of studio founder Carl Laemmle (she died as recently as 2014 aged 104).After local murmurings of vampires and Walpurgis Night, the camera allows us inside the dusty basement of Castle Dracula, where small animals scamper away as a selection of coffins betray their supernatural hosts. Three somnambulistic women and one man are revealed in near silence. These are beautiful, classic horror scenes. Dracula moves but rarely speaks. When he does, it is to welcome Renfield and then glides up a colossal stairway leaving his somewhat fey guest scrabbling through outsized spider's webs.Bela Lugosi had been playing Dracula on stage for some years and by 1931 made the role his own on film. It was a sensation. For a few months, he was an undisputed movie superstar, a horror icon. This story &#x96; which he described as a blessing and a curse &#x96; would be mentioned in virtually every interview and article about him until his death. He is magnificent, alien and captivating in these opening moments. The first time you see him, you notice how theatrical he is. When you watch him again, he is never quite as theatrical as you remember. He moves slowly, like a hungry lizard and is at one with the thick, macabre, frightening atmosphere &#x96; when he is removed from that, however, his performance takes on an anachronistic aspect.After an opening that is as near perfect as any in horror, Renfield loses his mind and is presided over by Martin, a warder at the sanatorium, (a truly grotesque, comedy-mock-cockney character who refers to his client as a 'loonie') and the horror is restricted almost entirely to Dracula's persona (on the rare occasions he is on screen) because the action is placed very much in the (then) present day. From here, it seems very much that we are watching a filmed theatre production, a drawing room drama. The camera barely moves, performances are very crisp and clear and static. The heroine Mina (Helen Chandler) is a meek, fragile, bloodless thing (perhaps The Count prefers subordinate females to Frances Dade's feistier Lucy) and her beau (David Manners) is even wetter. Of course, it is easy to note the difference in filmic styles from over 80 years ago &#x96; but 'Dracula' has dated less well in this respect than other films made during this era.As The Count is staked by Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing, it is off-screen. We hear a groan (trimmed on the insistence of the censor) and it is rather anti-climactic. One would have hoped that any sequel would give Lugosi's Dracula a more memorable send-off. What a shame it was with Abbott and Costello, 17 years later.Horror was a largely unknown genre in 1931, so Universal's trepidation was understandable. Whilst Lugosi approached his role with full-blooded confidence, it's a pity the studio didn't do the same.

For my money, Lugosi's stilted Hungarian accent, stiff and slow movements, and bright, piercing eyes make him the best film Dracula of them all. Edward Van Sloan's performance as Van Helsing makes him a worthy adversary of the Count who exclaims, memorably For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you are a wise man, Van Helsing. The film does reflect 1931 production values and does not have a particularly vivid ending; moreover, the almost silly performances of the actors portraying Mina and John Harker plus a couple of other elements in the film can place it, at times, in the camp class. But who can forget the mad Renfield groveling before his Master in between dining on flies and spiders. Lugosi shows Dracula's dominating presence and his powerful use of his hands in commanding come here to the weaker-willed characters in this film; they obey him and go to their destruction. But Van Helsing's will is equally strong and together with Dr. Seward and Harker and Van Helsing's knowledge of vampire lore, they ultimately prevent Mina from becoming, in another memorable phrase, this time from Van Helsing, a foul thing of the night.This Dracula is well worth watching every 5 to 10 years.

Okay, at times you can tell when the effects and sets aren't that great but I'll say it's still effective and the best reason for that is Lugosi. I don't think I need to say anything aside from it being the sole reason to watch this movie in my opinion. Okay, what's bad here? Well, everything that was wrong with Frankenstein is repeated here. The runtime is ridiculously short for the story they want to tell clocking in at around about 70 minutes, resulting in scenes stopping abruptly and the rule of Show don't tell being broken.

As far as I am concerned Bela Lugosi gave an incredible performance as Count Dracula. He had immense screen presence and old world charm. Bela Lugosi had a unique persona and had the ability to be creepy and charming simultaneously. No other actor embodies the essence of Dracula like Lugosi has done here. In this timeless classic, Mr. Lugosi really brings Dracula to life and sets a standard as well. The Spanish language version of the film was shot in the same time frame, using the same sets and script is a great companion piece to this film. For the most part its Spanish counterpart is a better made film. However, the Spanish version does not have Bela Lugosi, who in my opinion is a key element for the film to perform as well as it does. Dwight Frye also is very impressive here as Renfield as he delivered a very complex and insane performance. As a fan of the genre I enjoy and recommend both this version and the Spanish version.

This one manages to really get enjoyable with the grand opening here, making great use of the film's Gothic leanings here in a spectacular scene that's quite chilling. The night-time carriage ride is good enough with the mysterious driver and creepy ride, but the real fun here comes from the closed-off scenes found in the crypt of the castle where the four of them come out of their coffins in their graves in absolutely fun scenes that are quite creepy and chilling as the setting adds to the eeriness. Going right into the first meeting, where the absolutely grand Gothic castle that's littered with spider-webs that provide the source of a great visual gag and sets up the fantastic dinner scene and eventual corruption scene that's really fun. This also scores some fine points here in the build-up to his true revelation, getting the fine amount of bedroom stalking and reactions fully showing his intentions from the very beginning that makes for a decent mystery here. Otherwise, there's a lot more flaws here that really lower this one down away from these positives. The biggest issue here is the rather bland, boring pace, which indeed comes from the origins of the film but instead comes off as stiff, dodgy and way too talkative than it really needed to be. There's so little action here due to this rather irritated manner of talking or speaking out everything here rather than showing it as we don't even get the neck-bites or any true signs of vampirism on-screen other than what's told to us. In fact, so little of what happens here is told rather than shown this one could almost be seen as a romantic drama rather than a full-on horror effort, and it's really only the fact that he's a vampire which really causes this one to be reminded of a horror film. The only other issue holding this one back is the fact that all this talking means Van Helsing has to continuously explain things to everyone involved for her protection rather than simply explaining everything at the beginning, especially since he knows not only the means of dealing with a vampire but also where he's hiding out. After he suspects this, it's several days of trying to keep her in check arguing, and his location for the hiding spot isn't a secret so it would've been easier to go into action rather than stay back and talk everything out.

I also didn't like Dracula's death scene, because even that happened off-screen and without any real impact. I appreciate that some critics love this film and it is a landmark film, but it pales when you compare it to Universal's Frankenstein, which came out the same year. I just do not understand the adulation for this very stiff and unfrightening film and it is basically a horror film without any horror and that would not frighten even a young child. I have heard stories about audiences back in 1931 fainting in fear from this film, but I find that rather hard to believe and just seems like a way to market the film and make people see it. If you want to see a true classic 1930s horror film, then I suggest you try Frankenstein, which is superior to this in every way. I cannot imagine Dracula ever being scary, even back in 1931. A disappointing and underwhelming film in almost every way. It is still Bela Lugosi's most famous role, however, but that isn't really saying much.

The only vampire movie that I truly enjoyed so far is Let the Right one in. However with my desire to watch older horror in black and white I thought it would be interesting to watch the original Dracula movie. I have seen remakes, the one from the nineties for sure and other versions but most are too long ago now to remember. OK the plot is really simple and this is more about atmosphere than anything else. The Gothic atmosphere is translated well to the screen by means of the dark castle of the count in the beginning, the bat, the coffins and of course the appearance and gaze of Dracula masterfully given a face by Bela Lugosi. Kudos also to Dwight Frye who plays Renfield going from a serious guy to a crazy nut. I'm not an expert but everything you need to know about vampires is in this movie except for the gruesome teeth. In my opinion not really needed as Dracula's stare and the way he moves is terrifying enough for any of his preys.

Unless you opt for the new music in the 1999 DVD release, there is not one bit of music throughout it. No gore of any kind is shown. Barely any blood, fangs, bites or bite marks! The restoration is terrible. So grainy that I bet that some 16mm prints were used as a last resort for restoring missing scenes. (The shipwreck and fog scenes are terrible.) The obvious puppet bat is very well performed. I didn't see any wires at all! Still fun to watch, as poor Bella Lugosi get hopelessly typecast in his lifelong role!

In terms of classic horror, Browning's 1931 Dracula is definitely one of the most iconic films to ever grace the screen. Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula delivers a brilliant performance that thrills and excites the audience to no end. Despite being made over 80 years ago, Lugosi's Dracula is still found to be one of the most terrifying portrayals of the classic character. After all, this is the performance that not only launched Lugosi's acting career into high gear but set in motion the horror genre as it is today. With brilliant acting and an atmosphere to accompany it,Dracula is definitely one of the best there is.The only issue I had with this film was its ending. Despite being so full of plot, the ending lacked the substance it deserved. It ended rather quickly, and didn't give much explanation as to how the rest of the story played out.

The use of dim lighting and shadows is definitely not subtle, but still really amusing to watch out for. Most notably, when the Count's face falls into shadow, but a beam of light falls across his eyes (sort of like a reverse raccoon effect) and it really adds to the mortality emanating from him. I'm not a big fan of horror movies (from any period, really) and this film wasn't an exception, but I don't particularly regret watching it. The additions to contribute to the sinister atmosphere like the music, or the use of fog, were fun to note. The costumes were also impressively authentic, if a little dramatized. The way Bela Lugosi plays Dracula is remarkable, as well, because he embodies the very cold impression every audience member gets from his character. I wouldn't watch it again, because I found it a bit cheesy, script and prop-wise, but I recommend watching it if you're a horror movie/thriller buff. It's a great example of the pioneering horror movies of the '30s.

And of course there was the vampire fad with Twilight, Vampire Dairies, True Blood, just to name a few. So watching the original Dracula was fun, I liked to see all of the vampire stereotypes where they happened for the first time, the Transylvania accent, pale skin, charming personality, coffin sleeping, bats etc. Although I didn't find the movie very scary it did have some moments that were spooky, to me the the character that brought the most spook was the hopelessly devoted Renfield. His bulging eyes and lunatic behavior really made for some eerie scenes, one that immediately comes to mind is when the ship arrives to Europe and what they found is the whole ship crew dead and the unstable Renfield all by himself laughing. The movie also used shadows in great ways, many times the shot would be a close up on Dracula's face but casting a shadow over his entire face expect his eyes. This making the shot that more intense, this was done when Dracula was hypnotizing his victims. One negative thing I have to say about the movie was the ending. Through out the movie there was a lot of suspense and build up but it was so anti-climatic. There was a lot of action when chasing Dracula but before you knew it they found his coffin and the shot goes off to Mina and we hear Dracula off die of screen. The end. Over all the movie was good I just wish they carried the excitement all the way to the end of the movie.

I find it far fetched from your average monster movie because Dracula is immensely different from a character like Frankenstein. In this film we see a monster with what seems to be a conscious and personality. We can tell by his murderous and sometimes hostile actions that Count Dracula is not a regular human, in fact his evil doings are what make him monstrous. However, as a viewer we can see the obvious human characteristics he posses. The way Dracula lures victims in, such as Renfield, by appearing to be harmless makes the film a lot more interesting and exciting to watch. I have been a fan of horror films and works for as long as I can remember. From being a kid watching Goosebumps to now enjoying TV shows like true blood I have always enjoyed the horror genera. As I watch the 1931 version of Dracula the overbearing sense of similarity is definitely prevalent.

I have not been thoroughly impressed. This was my second film in that genre and it was not all that it was cracked up to be. Not only was it not all that frightening, and that's probably because my generation has been so desensitize, but I felt that there was much lacking from the film. The character development was so shallow and disappointing because you didn't know anything but the most basic facts about them! I could have read a one page report about the movie and not have missed a thing. The story was lacking so much as well, it all seemed to be implied due to Dracula's powers. Also much of what was happening was explained in short bursts by Professor Van Helsing (who came out of nowhere with his theory and explanations) and made the other men seem incompetent. Dracula also acknowledges Van Helsing as his enemy but nothing more develops from that, the dynamic between the hero and villain is not explored any further and it leaves something to be desired. Despite all that the film was lacking it did have some good cinema qualities that help put it in that classic status. The acting was well done and Lugosi did an excellent job as Count Dracula. He was able to carry himself with grace and also make you think twice about being alone in a room with him. Frye, who played Renfield, was also a well played character. The perpetually crazed look in his eyes was so impressive that it kept you waiting for that moment when he would finally turn his master over. The lighting was also very well done, especially when focusing on the vampiric eyes that held you captive until they used you or disposed of you. The sets were also very impressive. The castle in Transylvania and even below the abbey where Dracula sleeps. They are so elaborate, made to look abandoned and creepy, until you get to the living spaces, and even then, there is an air of grace.

It does creak in places and the stagey elements will turn off a lot of those viewers who don't frequently watch older films. But it's undeniably a classic and I feel it still entertains, despite its flaws. The story, which I'm sure we're all familiar with by now, starts with Renfield (Dwight Frye) traveling to Transylvania to finalize the lease of Carfax Abbey in England to Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi). Once at the Count's castle, Renfield falls under his spell. When the ship they take to England arrives with everybody on board dead and drained of blood, Renfield is held responsible and committed to an asylum. But the real killer is centuries-old vampire Dracula, who now preys on the women of London. When Dracula sets his sights on Mina Seward (Helen Chandler) he arouses the suspicions of the distinguished Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), who knows all about vampires and sets out to stop the evil Count.Classic Universal horror film that, along with Frankenstein, set off the 1930s horror boom as well as cementing the public image of Dracula for decades to come. The script owes as much, if not more, to the stage play than to Bram Stoker's original novel. It's a much more restrained film than you might expect considering it's about vampires. There are no fangs, no blood, and the stake-through-the-heart scene occurs offscreen. Even Renfield's depravities are only alluded to rather than shown. Tod Browning's direction is often stiff and receives a lot of deserved criticism. But there are some iconic scenes and images, helped in large part by the great cinematographer Karl Freund. Unsubstantiated reports are Freund actually directed a good deal of the movie, which may account for why sometimes the camera moves and provides for interesting shots while other times the camera is drearily static. Things are at their stagiest during the setbound scenes in London. Never is it worse than in the scene where David Manners' John Harker tries to shoo away an obviously fake bat (Look out, he'll get in your hair!). The scene is suppose to take place on a terrace but it's clearly a set with matte painting walls that poorly resemble the actual outdoors. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that even die-hard fans must chuckle a little over.Career-defining roles for Lugosi, Van Sloan, and Frye. Bela Lugosi's Dracula is the version by which all others are measured. Lugosi played the part on the stage and brings a level of theatricality to the role, hamming it up gloriously. His distinct way of delivering lines -- speaking slowly with his thick Hungarian accent and mid-sentence pauses -- would be often imitated over the years in a similar way to how people imitate William Shatner's line delivery today. Edward Van Sloan is the definitive Van Helsing. As much as I love Peter Cushing in the role, all vampire hunter roads lead to Van Sloan. Dwight Frye, another wonderful ham, is superb as the wild-eyed Renfield. Subtlety was never Frye's strong point and God bless him for it. David Manners and Helen Chandler are the film's weakest links, with overly affected performances that add to the criticisms of staginess.I caution everybody against watching the version with the new music score. Yes the film creaks at times and the lack of a music score doesn't help. But the version released in the '90s with the Phillip Glass score is just awful. The music is overbearing and very noticeably modern. It doesn't fit the movie at all and is more distracting than anything. So avoid that. But you should check out the Spanish language version, filmed at the same time as this one. While this filmed during the day, the Spanish version was filmed at night using the same sets and script, though its runtime is quite a bit longer. That version is often praised as being superior to this one. You can read my review on that film for my thoughts on it.

Lugosi gives one of the best and most memorable performances ever put into a movie, he's sinister, threatening, his stare (which is focused on many time) and the way he says his lines in that Hungarian accent all of it makes Lugosi not portray Dracula but he IS Dracula. The movie doesn't have a soundtrack at all if there's no talking there is no noise, but that's good it again heightens the mood of everything. For a movie that's 80 years + it is surprisingly.... frighting. Not in the sense of pure fear but more in the way that the whole time your kept in total suspense, the entire movie just felt like a long scene with endless suspense, this is due to the lack of music, scenery and Bela Lugosi's performance, I love the feeling of it.

The recurring face that Lugosi made throughout the film was enough to scare a person. Not to mention that creepy laugh and look on Frye's face that happened on occasion during this film. Many other things were creepy about this movie as well, such as the castle in Transylvania, the fact that Dracula could walk through that giant spider web, and many more things. The acting was all around superb in Dracula. The pace moved kind of slow though, and the movie seemed to drag on a bit. The fact that there was no music in this film to accompany the acting made the movie seem slower. This movie is a classic however, meaning it is loved by most.

Certain things are now amusing or bizarre that would have probably been very scary in the 1930's. For example, some armadillos (aardvarks?) emerge from the wall in Count Dracula's castle upon Renfield's arrival, at which I laughed, but perhaps not many people would have known what these animals looked like then and in that case yes, they would be freaky! IMDb lists things like being able to see the wires on Dracula's bat form as goofs, which I'm not denying, but considering the technology of the day such details were still overwhelmed by the atmosphere created by a thunderstorm or dimmed lighting. It was awkward getting used to the lack of soundtrack, but then again, you should feel uncomfortable in a horror movie. Perhaps director Tod Browning (point of irony Tod is Death in German) did this purposefully or for some other reason left it to the children of the night...what music they make. It is evident why Bela Lugosi was known for this movie, but I personally liked Frye's performance as Renfield most. He was stilted and awkward as the English businessman in the foreign land in the beginning, and transforms quite convincingly into a mad lunatic.

Tod Browning directed the black and white movie with Bela Lugosi cast as Count Dracula. Lugosi ,having performed the same role on the Broadway stage, won the part and became the iconic model for future portrayals of Count Dracula.The story opens in Transylvania, with English businessman Renfield (Dwight Frye) traveling to visit Count Dracula's castle. The local residents warn Renfield of the dangers, but he ignores their concerns. It is here that one first observes Count Dracula with his penetrating eyes and haunting voice; subsequent scenes of Dracula will continue to mesmerize the viewer using the same filming technique. Facilitated by Renfield, Count Dracula moves to England, and death follows him throughout his voyage. In England, Dracula meets his nemesis &#x96; Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). Van Helsing quickly becomes aware of the dangers this enchanting, mysterious figure presents. The story then follows the battle for the soul of a young woman &#x96; Mina (Helen Chandler). Only one of the adversaries will prevail. The early scenes had several 'bloopers' due to minor editing errors, but the sets for the castle in Transylvania and the Abbey in England are extraordinary and set the tone for this Gothic horror. The close-ups of Bela Logusi's character are striking and terrifying, and undoubtedly convey to the audience the evil persona of Count Dracula. Tod Browning also infused several scenes of light humor with Renfield and Martin (Charles Gerrard) providing comic relief; an effective technique to allow audiences to relax before the next horrifying scene of Dracula. With a run time of 85 minutes, the movie has a pleasant pace. Several scenes place much emphasis on visual context as opposed to dialogue, but this approach helps to build up the apprehension of the audience during the movie.

However, after seeing a bit of the opening for the Spanish version and then the English version... I almost feel like the English one is cheesier. I'd like to see the other version in full with English subtitles.Perhaps I'm bad at following movies, because I couldn't quite catch all the information on the characters in the beginning. The movie seems to just start right in the middle of something that the characters have already been planning. So that was strange. But I really liked Bela Lugosi, he was quite funny. Which was probably very unintentional, but I'm watching this as a young person of 2013. So my reaction is probably very different than of those when this movie was new. But that at least made it more enjoyable to watch and kept my interest. I feel it's worth watching again in the future, to pick up on what small parts confused me. It would be good to watch on something other than my laptop, as the sound track is kind of hard to hear at times, even at my laptops loudest.

Such as Frankenstein, The Mummy & The Invisible Man etc. But the truth is Dracula is a disappointing classic. It starts out excellent & strikingly atmospheric & visually creative for the first 30 minutes or so. Renfield's (Dwight Frye) visit to Count Dracula's Castle is amazingly dreamlike, surreal & chilling & scary & at first he's rational & sane as he encounters the vampire. Bela Lugosi is absolutely mesmerizing & chilling as Dracula.But as soon as the story shifts from Dracula's Castle in Transylvania to London, England the film deteriorates & falls apart & never really recovers from the excellent Transylvanian scenes. It becomes too theatrical & resembles a stage play with too much talking & not enough action. And too much of the film focuses on Renfield now under Dracula's hypnotic control & is reduced to a raving mad lunatic slave. Dwight Frye overacts too much & it gets old fast. The young couple John Harker & Mina (David Manners & Helen Chandler) are very wooden & boring.Professor Van Helsing (Everett Van Sloan) was a more interesting character who confronts & exposes Dracula. But even he is given too much screen time & there's only fleeting moments of Bela Lugosi. Tod Browning's direction lacks consistency & is uninspiring after the first 30 minutes & shows lack of interest & seems unsure where to go with it or maybe he just didn't care. As soon as the story moves to London the film just didn't seem to have a clear direction & just plods & drags on aimlessly with no conviction. It might've been better if Dracula after being exposed by the Professor returned to his Castle in Transylvania.And what was Dracula's reason & motive for sailing to London in the first place ? When he already has a Castle in Transylvania it doesn't make any sense at all. Oh that's right he purchased Carfax Abbey in London but why ?? & where would Dracula get the money ?? As soon as Dracula moves to London the film becomes a dull & boring stage play & it struggles a bit to sustain your interest & is hard to sit through. But the first 30 minutes are fantastic !! After that it's downhill & a disappointment but still worth seeing as Bela Lugosi was & is the definitive Dracula. It's just too bad Tod Browning fell asleep when Dracula moved to London.

Lugosi does a good cross between suave and creepy, and the story has always been an effective one.But this early sound movie betrays its stage origins and studio staging constantly (and far more so than FW Murnau's silent 1922 Nosferatu). This is a talky adaptation (meaning lots of talking as opposed to an early sound film), with a camera which is almost completely static - it might as well be stuck in the stalls filming the proscenium. Lugosi's performance now comes across as rather hammy, most of the cast are unmemorable (with the single exception of Dwight Frye's splendid Renfield), and Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing doesn't inspire. There are no special effects to speak of, and even the spotlights intended to make Dracula's eyes look as if they are glowing sometimes miss.There have been better versions since. Value this film for its place in history, and for its impact at the time, and then watch a more modern version.

It is interesting that Bela Lugosi had to practically beg to be given the lead role as Count Dracula, and today the Lugosi Dracula is one of the most universally recognized vampire portrayals. If you have trouble understanding the subtleties of early black and white film, find it difficult to comprehend that in 1931 many theaters didn't even have sound yet, and struggle to stay awake during movies with extensive dialog rather than explosions(Michael Bay), I would advise staying away from this horror classic. On the other hand, if you can watch a movie made in 1931 and appreciate it for what it is given the time in which it came to the big screen, then by all means, this is a must see movie for any true film lover.

This isn't the type of movie that will scare you nowadays, back in the 1930's it may have though. The photography is excellent and the picture is very clear throughout the movie. My main complaint is the acting. The movie is very drawn out and slow, instead of Dracula being dominant and being a scary blood sucking vampire he instead moves very slowly and gives the victim time to simple run away; but -- unrealistically the victims always seem to stand and scream and allow Dracula to bite their neck instead of simply running away while he is slow lowering his face to their neck. I'm guessing that this is the way it is because of the ratings board and censorship back in the 1930s. Today there are obviously much scarier movies and because of that this movie just didn't seem to frighten me whatsoever.Overall I rated the movie a 7 because the sound and photography are excellent; and it's one of the earlier horror movies.

Most of the acting aside from Lugosi's, Sloan's and Frye's is awful with awkward pauses between lines and actions. Characters will often make a single appearance and disappear from the movie, never to be mentioned again(Dracula's brides).

The reason we all imagine Dracula with the cowled cape, widow's peak and pale white face is entirely thanks to this film, and that kind of iconicity should not go under-appreciated.The film itself plays in stark contrast to what you think of when you think old movies. Whereas the Silent Era featured nothing but music, Dracula &#x97; due to certain Hollywood notions at the dawn of the Talkie era &#x97; completely avoids the use of any scoring. With nothing to enhance dramatic effect, the film becomes an exercise in creepiness.The gingerly pacing of most of the scenes, namely Dracula's attacks, and their lack of any satisfying conclusion thanks to cutaways forced of course by censorship requirements back in the day, could warrant a good share of criticism. Without the music to build toward these turning points in the film, it's almost awkward, but there's a sense of a deliberate, artistic choice behind each slow creep toward a victim, each shot of Dracula's face and his unforgettable stare. In a two-hour film it might be an unnecessary pain, but at 75 minutes, it has a place. Director Tod Browning gets his credit there to be sure, but he's not the reason we revisit this monster movie.Dracula comes from the stage adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel rather than the novel itself, specifically. In it, we follow Dracula to London as he secures the Carfax Abbey property with his recently converted servant Renfield (Dwight Frye) as he preys on young Lucy Weston (Frances Dade) and then her friend, Mina Seward (Helen Chandler). Mina's father (Herbert Brunson) and fianc√©, John Harker (David Manners), turn to the help of Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) to prevent her from turning into a vampire. Lugosi played the role of Dracula on stage, and became known for getting a bit too into the character over the course of his lifetime. He made concessions to do whatever it took to be in the film, and we benefit from it. His stare and his mannerisms create the (at the time) wholly unique image of Count Dracula.It's not textbook suspense, but you can't help but be curious to see what Dracula will do next. He's a magnetic figure and he drives our curiosity to the point that we become wrapped up in the story, no matter how slow it might feel at times.You can't say Dracula is not a classic with a straight face. You might not identify it as a truly scary movie, or a truly suspenseful one, but its imagery has become so synonymous with the folk depiction of Dracula that it definitely did something very, very right.~Steven CThanks for reading!

As horrorfilmhistory.com explains, this was the very first talking horror film. Because of this, nobody at the time of production really knew how the audience would react to it. However, once they realized how successful it was, other movies (featuring various monsters and mad scientists) emerged to meet the demand. So it was this film, more than any other, that created the horror genre we enjoy today. That's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. And while it's true that the special effects were rather primitive in comparison to today's technology, it had some good features which tended to compensate. For example, I found the background scenery of the Carpathian Mountains and the way Dracula's eyes were illuminated to be quite impressive. As far as the acting is concerned, I thought Bela Lugosi was simply superb as Count Dracula. Likewise, Edward Van Sloan (Van Helsing) and Dwight Frye (Renfield) also perform their roles in an excellent manner. Additionally, Helen Chandler (Mina) was quite attractive even if her acting was only adequate.

There are so many things wrong with the film - Dwight Frye's annoying pantomimical performance, the convoluted mish-mash of a story, the mood-killing comic segments. Really, other than the iconic images, of which most people are familiar, there really isn't much to champion about this rendition. Bela Lugosi is excellent and intense, which only adds to the frustration of everything around him being sloppy and farcical. The Vampire Bat, a poverty-row production also from 1931 and featuring Frye, is known for its minuscule budget and even with its many flaws, I found it to be much more enjoyable than Dracula. For a truly creepy and entertaining story of The Count, I recommend Hammer's Horror Of Dracula - which perfectly captures the Gothic mood and style while channeling it through a far superior story and cast.

I anticipated something spooky that would leave with an eerie feeling when quite honestly I feel asleep three times while trying to watch this film and had to continually re-start it. The movie started off good and indeed grabbed my attention, but shortly into the movie I was lost. They went from being in Transylvania to being on a ship then being in Europe or something I am not even sure. I did not see the point of this at all and it is where I started to drift off. I was ready for blood sucking excitement, not doctors and a scientist discussing what was taking place while a random victim here and there was murdered by Dracula. Another thing I found very confusing was Renfield, he was very distracting and somewhat annoying and I found him purposeless in the film. On a positive note Helen Chandler's acting was phenomenal as Mena; she played every aspect of her role to a T. The movie did have a few scenes that I enjoyed, but overall I'd have to say it was a mediocre film with a poor plot and average acting (besides Helen Chandler). The film was not necessarily bad, but it isn't something I would really suggest to anyone who is looking for an interesting all-time classic film.

Count Dracula is just a downright creepy dude, living in his super secluded castle in Transylvania, going out at night as a wolf or bat, to stalk his prey. Nothing wrong with that. Bela Lugosi has the right look and gives off a good eerie vibe to his character, but I found the many close up scenes of him to be almost laughable. All you got is a creepy stare from him, it felt like every 10 minutes. Also, some of the fake screams you hear, from off screen, were hardly believable.The stage sets are also very good, like Dracula's burial ground and inside of his castle I thought were beautifully constructed. An interesting tale nonetheless, and Mr. Lugiosi and Dwight Frye (who played the insane assistant) play they're parts brilliantly, and are most entertaining to watch, although I found some of the other actors to be cheesy and almost lackluster.

While I can certainly agree with that statement to an extent, for me this film, although enjoyable, was nothing particularly amazing. Bella does deliver a timeless performance as the blood thirsty count, but as someone who has grown up with shows and movies about vampires that mock the older myths, ie. True Blood, Cirque De Freak, et al... it seems to me as though this film was lacking. It is clearly understood that why this film was so revered in its time among both the common viewer as as cinema aficionados, but several elements of the film left me feeling quite disappointed. To be sure, all the scenes where Dracula is flying around as a bat are nothing short of hilarious, and while many would say that any laugh is a good laugh, for a film of such a serious nature that deals with the mortal questions of life and death, I do not feel as though laughter would be well served. I am almost certain that is not the response the filmmakers were hoping to elicit from their viewers. Secondly among this list of shortcomings was the character of Remfield. In Remfield the filmmakers had the chance to exploit and further a truly despicable character that would almost strike as much fear in the viewer as Dracula himself; however, the film never turned that corner, so to speak. While the close-up of Remfield staring maniacally on the bottom of the stairs after the boat massacre was indeed quite eerie and bone-chilling, I feel as though so much more could have done with that quality of unique character. That being said, it is not my intent to tear this film apart, for it is a piece of classic American filmmaking that does deserve a place in the annals of history, both for its grand performances, as well as its overall mis-en-sene. That, the overall feel of the film that is, is one area that was certainly not lacking or deficient in any way. I was able to relate to, or at the very least empathize with, the villagers fear of the night and all the things that it brought out. Additionally, the scenery and set design added to the overall feeling of a well-made picture, albeit the camera felt a little shaky and jerky, for lack of a better phrase. In comparison to Laemmle's Frankenstein, which featured exceedingly smooth camera work and shooting, this film possessed no such qualities. Nonetheless, this film is still a classic that should, and indeed is, enjoyed by audiences to this day, almost 81 years later. I would recommend it to any fans of Horror, especially fans of Dracula films in particular, who are seeking the film that stands as the patriarch to all subsequent versions.

But in 1931, a bit like 3D now, there was still much confusion over to how make films, with directors, producers and actors alike, were still moving over from the suddenly dated silent era, with varying success.Tod Browning was a man who would unfortunately find little success in the sound era, but not necessarily because he couldn't move with the times, but because his career was derailed a couple of years later by his disturbing horror pic, Freaks.Dracula was shot THREE times. One, this one, was the conventional sound version that we all know. An other was shot at night and in Spanish for the benefit of that audience, which the studio supposedly preferred. This was quite common at this time, but little known nowadays. And the third was a straight forward silent version for the many theatres still un-equipped to handle sound.But the styles of the silent era are all over this film. From the long silent reactions shots and the over acting, especially by Bela Lagosi in the titular role. This was also the adaptation of the stage adaptation of Bram Stoker's chiller, and was faithfully adapted from that source, hence the lack of more complex special effects, with bats on strings and fog machines, over more cinematic effects.The transformation scenes for example, where the Count morphs from a bat to the undead human occur off-screen, rather than some form of cross fade etc. Is this a choice driven by lack of money? Lack of cinematic ambition of a choice to stick to the stage material? To be honest, I have too little knowledge or experience of Tod Browning's work to suggest a reason, but when all's said and done, it did work.Let's be honest, this is 80 years old and is not the least bit scary and it is hard not to laugh, but in context, I'm sure it worked well at the time and the story is well conveyed. Lagosi's undead performance is hammy by today's standards but he was somewhat likable. He was very deliberate, slow and the silent era has certainly left its scars, as the subtly of sound performing was yet to take hold.But this is the sort of film were silent melodramatic acting still worked. This is of course a piece Gothic Horror, the home of melodrama if ever there was one. This is surly a product of its time, both as the industry went through one of it's most dramatic changes, which ended so many careers as well a created so many new ones, but it's also, let's not forget, the first direct adaptation of Bram Stoker's book, besides the 1922 German version, Nosferatu, which changes a fair few details to try to get around the copyright, failing to do so mind, resulting in failed bid to have every copy of the film destroyed.This is the film that ingrained the image of the Dracula that we know today into popular culture. This was were the Universal horror franchise began. For whatever faults it has by today's standards, it did something right.

Others turn more vinegary. Dracula contains a clever idea, a noteworthy central performance, and introduced sound to the horror film. It's just the execution that's lacking.There's a new tenant at Carfax Abbey in rural England, one Count Dracula (B√©la Lugosi) who wears a dinner jacket and cape at all times and opts to leave his new home a dark, shambling ruin. As a nobleman, no one seems to think adversely of this stranger, even as people in his wake are found dead with marks on their throats, a madman named Renfield (Dwight Frye) hints of Dracula's darker purpose, and the Count introduces himself to a couple of young ladies with rather morbid banter.To die, to be really dead, that must be glorious! he intones in that often-imitated Hungarian accent of his. There are far worse things awaiting man than death...Dracula isn't worse than death, just deathly dull. For a film that runs under 75 minutes, there's a lot of slow stretches. Lugosi's surrounded by a cast seemingly determined to act more undead than he. Love interests Mina and John are played by actors as stiff as boards, while Herbert Bunston, the actor playing Mina's father Dr. Seward, declaims every line as if giving the Gettysburg Address. Frye is up and down in his manic characterization, while Edward Van Sloan's Professor Van Helsing is entirely too smug.Worse is the direction, or lack thereof, by Tod Browning. The first 20 minutes of Renfield's meeting Dracula at his castle in Transylvania sets a properly grim mood, but after that it's like this film is sailing as much without a captain as the poor, doomed Vesta. Scene after scene is shot in a flat, static manner. Dracula's confrontations with other characters are drained of any menace. Lame comic relief from a warder who wisecracks about his loony charge Renfield feels trowelled on, because it is.Lugosi gave better performances in other films, like his underrated turn as Ygor in Son Of Frankenstein. Here, though, he gives Dracula its one undeniable dynamic, and a badly needed star presence. His urbanity hints with gentle suspense at the fiend within, while many of his line deliveries hint at a kind of pathos that almost pulls us to his side. His silent staring at the camera are still chilling however they have been sent up comedically in later decades.But there are so many holes in this scattershot adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel that the contempt begins to drip off the screen. Why is Renfield kept around by the Count? What finally happens to Mina's tragic friend Lucy? How come the finale is so abrupt and easy, after we have been told of Dracula's great power?Browning apparently didn't care. History tells us he was so busy brooding about the actor he couldn't use in this film (Lon Chaney had died the year before) that he couldn't be bothered to work with the very formidable actor who arrived in his place. The end result was a movie that should have been great, but wound up just being very, very famous.

THIS is the movie that put fright films on the map; and to have found a more perfect fit for the lead would've probably been impossible Lugosi was Hungarian, Count Dracula, Transylvanian (you can't get much closer than that). If a 500 year old vampire count existed, he would almost surely have spoken the way Lugosi speaks in the movie (though in Stoker's book his diction is precise and not noticeably regional). The first half of Dracula is brilliant; it's everything following his arrival in London that brings the movie to a screeching halt. Once it becomes slow and stagey, it loses much of the effectiveness of the early scenes. For this, blame must be laid with director Browning; Lugosi holds up his end of things well enough- it's the man behind the camera who drops the ball. It's interesting to backtrack Stoker and read the stories that in whole or in part seem to have inspired his novel in THE VAMPYRE (1819), by John Polidori, we come across the line ...death, he remembered, had already been mocked. Sounds more than a little like Van Sloan as Van Helsing, does it not? The finest prose prior to Stoker's novel would have to be found in James Malcolm Rymer's tight, descriptive VARNEY THE VAMPIRE (1845) Here suddenly had arisen a something at once terrible and inexplicable. The unfinished FRAGMENT OF A NOVEL (1816), by Lord Byron, is of interest for two reasons one, it contains a description of the death of a vampire that would've made a great scene at the end of Dracula (in which The Count's dying moments occur offscreen and are heard but not shown) ...his countenance in a few minutes became nearly black. THAT would've been a GREAT way to close the show. The second reason Byron's fragment should be of interest to fright fans is that it was written following the same historic gathering at which Mary Shelly was persuaded to start writing FRANKENSTEIN.

Frye plays a man who is striving for his own sanity, and Van Sloan plays a wise, Van Helsing. The ending is not the best, but to be honest, this film makes up for that. Dracula has many scenes that have complete silence, and they work beautifully, but were also used because directors like Tod Browning, were afraid to deal with dialog and Dracula was the first talking supernatural-thriller.

There's no denying that there are some great things sprinkled throughout the picture but at the same time there are even more flaws and most of them can be blamed on director Tod Browning. If you've seen any of Browning's silent movies then you'll be shocked to watch this and know he directed it because it's just so stagey and poor looking that it's hard to believe it's from the same man.I say that because this movie has a very stagey look and very little life or energy to it. You watch this movie and can't help but wonder why there wasn't more done in regards to its visual style. After all, the director had a nice budget to work with yet you couldn't tell that by looking at the film. There are a few nice shots scattered throughout the picture including the introduction of Dracula and the stuff on the ship is well handled as well. With that said, the film certainly drags at spots and the lack of any real energy is something that hinders it.What works best about the American version of Dracula are the performances. I thought the entire cast was highly entertaining even if some of them are a bit too wooden. I'd direct that comment to David Manners who doesn't really get to do too much here. Chandler is certainly good in her role as is Frances Dade in the role of Lucy. Van Sloan makes for a very believable and classy Van Helsing and Frye is very memorable in his role. Of course, the film belongs to Lugosi. The image of Lugosi in the role of Dracula is pretty much set in stone with most considering him the true and only Dracula. He's certainly magical here and his presence on the screen really jumps out at you and especially if you're lucky enough to see this on the big screen.With that said, I'm not going to lie as I think, performance wise, his role in ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN is better.

Whereas James Whale's film shows a mastery of both cinema's visual and auditory elements, most of the horror directors of the early sound era seem to have little command of dialogue or music. They resort to extended sequences of silence between words, accompanied by a muffled din of background noise, which are presumably intended to heighten the suspense; instead, it makes a 70 minute story somehow feel much longer. Unfortunately, Tod Browning's film &#150; considered the definitive version of Bram Stoker's novel &#150; is more akin in style to 'The Black Cat (1934)' and 'The Raven (1935).' This isn't necessarily a bad thing Karl Freund's Expressionistic cinematography is frequently impressive, and Bela Lugosi's hammy theatrics, however ludicrous they might seem today, nonetheless keep you watching the screen. But I must confess an overwhelming preference towards Murnau's previous unauthorised Dracula tale, 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922).'In the darkened hills of Transylvania (cue the thunderclap), a young lawyer (Dwight Frye) travels through the night to deliver legal papers to Count Dracula (Lugosi), despite the warnings of the locals. Drugged, imprisoned and driven insane by the scheming Count, he later returns to England, bringing along his new vampire master, who then proceeds to wreak havoc on the pretty young women of London. A scientist named Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan; I find it amusing that, over seventy years, this old professor would somehow evolve into Hugh Jackman) comes to believe that a vampire is loose on the streets, and sets about capturing the enigmatic monster before it claims the life of the beautiful, virginal Mina Harker (Helen Chandler). This simple plot unfolds in a rather clumsy, stilted manner. Browning, an experienced director of silent films, appears unsure of how to use music in a sound picture, and so he omits it almost entirely. The gaping auditory void left by this absence emphasises the stage-bound roots of the material, a realisation that restricts the horror that one might otherwise feel.The performances are better than anybody experienced in Universal horror has any right to expect. Lugosi's role as the sinister Count justly made him famous, and, though he would only reprise the role once more for an Abbot & Costello comedy, strains of this portrayal are clearly evident in the likes of 'Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932)' and 'The Raven (1935).' Lugosi's Dracula wasn't as classy as I'd been expecting (the promotional photos somehow suggested a suave, charming aristocrat), and his fragmented line delivery and brazen mugging often brought a few chuckles, but the performance is nonetheless likable in its cheesiness. The beautifully-photographed sequences of Dracula majestically emerging from his coffin are well-orchestrated, and certainly one of the areas where the lack of music contributes to the chill-factor. Dwight Frye overplays frenziedly to try and steal scenes from his Hungarian co-star, largely to no avail, but it's always good to see such energy in an actor's work. While 'Dracula' may not be the masterpiece of which I'd heard, no horror fan can afford to miss it.

Not one to waste much time Dracula quickly makes Renfield his slave and travels to England, killing an entire ship's crew on the way. In London he settles to his new home that is next to an asylum run by Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston). Dracula quickly becomes interested in Seward's daughter Mina (Helen Chandler) and her friend Lucy Weston (Frances Dade). It doesn't take long when Seward and Mina's fianc√© John Harker (David Manners) notice that some strange illness has taken the girls. Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) is summoned and the fight against centuries old evil begins.This is the Dracula movie most people remember and that has most influenced later anything even remotely linked to Dracula. Made in 1931 this film started the Universal Studio's production of horror movies that lasted over a decade and produced such films as Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), The Wolf Man (1941) and remake of Phantom of the Opera (1943).Although the film is probably most famous adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, it's not exactly based on book itself, but on a successful theater adaptation of the book by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston. The play was first run in London and was later brought to Broadway. In this lies one of the film's biggest flaws. Since it's very accurately based on a play, there are many scenes that are shot in the same sets with same people, without that anything would actually happen. The biggest difference between play and movie is the first 15 minutes that are set in Transylvania. The beautiful sets of Carpathian Mountains and Count's old castle with huge cobwebs and coffins, combined with cameraman Karl Freund's moving camera-work, are alone worth to see. However, very sadly, the moment the film moves to London the magic is gone. Film becomes suddenly slow, almost dragging, and especially the ending is very anticlimactic. The film only has its moments again whenever Dracula appears, most notably the scene where Van Helsing reveals Dracula's true nature with a help of a mirror.The biggest and possibly the main reason why the film is still considered classic is the impressive (and immortal) performance as Dracula by Bela Lugosi. Originally the part in the film was meant for Lon Chaney, who had done numerous silent films with Dracula's director Tod Browning in the 1920's. Chaney however died before the production was even started and the part was given to Lugosi, an Austrian-Hungarian actor who had starred as Dracula in the Broadway play. Many people still consider Lugosi to be the Dracula and I can't blame them much. His theatrical gestures, slow movements, hypnotic stare and an accent (that was his own and not acted) make him seem like he is from another era totally. Many actors who have later played Dracula, like Gary Oldman and Richard Roxburgh, have named Lugosi as the Dracula who most influenced them. Also the most stereotypical image of Dracula, with black hair, pale face, tuxedo and cape are all from Bela Lugosi.Beside of Lugosi the most memorable actor in the film is Dwight Frye, whose insane giggling has later been copied by other Renfields, mostly in Dracula comedies like Love at First Bite (1979) and Dracula- Dead and Loving It (1995). Edward Van Sloan also delivers a decent performance as Van Helsing, while the rest of the cast is trying to get used to the idea they're not making a silent film anymore and should speak to the microphone. Harker's player David Manners is especially bad in the film.So, Tod Browning's film version of Dracula may not be the best version ever made and certainly not the most entertaining of the Universal's 1930's horror classics. Yet it still holds its place as the most famous of many Dracula films made, and should be viewed at least once. The biggest credits goes to Bela Lugosi, who is most popular Dracula but whose other performances are not remembered that much. As Lugosi himself later said Dracula is a blessing and a curse, and he will never die.

It was not THIS particular movie which launched the vampire legends, although being only the second film to deal with this theme (the first being Murnau's NOSFERATU, 1922), it surely warrants blame for savagely promulgating the myth. Bram Stoker's 1897 novel was fleshed out (and diluted) for the silver screen by writer/director Tod Browning and a host of other writers. The passage of time and innumerable bastardizations of the story have eroded Stoker's truly disturbing tale, making it inconsequential to the character at its center &#150; so though our memories composite Christopher Lee's Dracula debacles and Anne Rice's vampires and blaxploitation's BLACULA and Scott Bakula &#150; the original story should be remembered for its composting of ancient legends into a compelling original tale.Purely for the iPod-ders, the plot a young British solicitor, Jonathan Harker, travels to the Carpathian Mountains (in Transylvania &#150; yes, say it with the accent) to offer real estate advice to Count Dracula, who wishes to move to London. He discovers the Count to be a blood-sucking denizen of the night, who can shape shift into a bat or wolf at will, whose reflection cannot be seen in mirrors and whose incisors were badly in need of filing down. All the better to bite the neck and drink the blood of his victims, turning them into undead vampires like himself. Dracula travels to London and cultivates Harker's fianc√©e, Mina and her busty clubbing buddy, Lucy, with love bites and blood infusions via carotid. Dr. Van Helsing is called in to examine Mina and Lucy's strange anemic sickness and knows enough about vampires to eventually kill Dracula by severing his head and driving a stake through his heart while he sleeps in his coffin. Even the basic gist of the tale opens up so many dark avenues of discussion (possession, psychosis of blood-drinking, perverse sexuality, bizarre murders, sleeping in COFFINS?!) that it would be impossible to explore in a thousand rants.Hungarian stage star, Bela Lugosi, shot to fame as the eeevil Count Dracula; if it weren't for his presentational stage training, he would never have come up with that crippled hand thingy which Christopher Lee borrowed to such great effect not only as Dracula himself, but also Fu Manchu, Saruman and Count Dooky Del Rio in *Star Wars Episode Poo.* And Lugosi never actually says, I vont to zuck yor blud! File it in the Play it again, Sam bin &#150; merely misquoted Legend. Dwight Frye plays Dracula's horror movie sidekick, Renfield &#150; brainwashed by Dracula into subservience and psychosis, eating bugs and walking with a stoop like a horror movie sidekick; immortalized as the Igor-type when he accepted an identical role on Frankenstein (Nov 1931) as Fritz; further immortalized on Alice Cooper's 1971 album *Love It To Death* in *The Ballad of Dwight Fry.*Though the novel Dracula (written when Stoker was 50) is still a scorching read (the brooding words cascade off the page like that liquid nitrogen smoke all these movies use to blanket the ground in graveyards - coincidentally used to great effect on KISS and Alice Cooper stages), the movie is unfortunately made for another time, a bygone age; when people who hadn't yet touched each other called themselves lovers; when each question was presaged with, Why, as in, Why &#150; what's the matter, darling?; when the Hero ran like a girl and never appeared anywhere without a three-piece suit and his hat; when the simplest of gestures was a melodramatic flourish because that's the only way stage actors knew how to act; when interminable gaping holes of no audio have actually become dramatic silences in retrospect; when nakedness meant knees&#133; To quote the great Gary Oldman as The Count in *BRAM STOKER'S Dracula (1992), I have crossed oceans of time&#133; This movie has crossed those oceans &#150; and it shows. Even movies from ten years ago look dated - think about a film nearly 80 years old!And only the great Gary Oldman could truly instill the mind-blanking terror that a blood-drinking maniac should evoke. When we see him as the continental Count or the leather-skinned bat-man, it is a disturbing experience, worthy of a modern incarnation of the aged legend. Lugosi must have been frightful in his day, but nowadays just looks fruity; Christopher Lee's menace has dated embarrassingly; Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were just too, too beautiful to be taken seriously and if anyone even mentions Mamuwalde I might have to put on mah mah mah mah boogie shoes&#133;.

Filmmakers in the early sound period amplified the imperfection of new aural recording by writing staid, dialogue-heavy scripts, thereby spotlighting the mechanism and not the work for which it labored. Seen today, it's amazing how well Dracula manages to avoid this temptation. Karl Freund, the great visionary DP of Metropolis, creates a timelessly redolent atmosphere of macabre details ambiguously glimpsed in the Count's shadowy, crumbling lair, like the rodents of uncertain breeding skulking in and around his coffin or the somnambulistic walk of his brides as they seem to evaporate in the densely cobwebbed cellar. As we are gradually drawn in by such ephemerae, the plunge into the unrealities of this ethereal world is realized through sly staging, tricks of shadow and light, and the conviction of Lugosi's formidable glowing stare. Due credit must be shared with Charles D. Hall and his design of the castle and the matte-painted, Transylvania countryside, all jagged craters and mountainous peaks which threaten to consume the curious envoys that venture there. I dare say this prologue comprises one of the more strangely poetic passages in all of classic Hollywood cinema.Unfortunately, the farther the aesthetic focus drifts from these foreign haunts, the nearer the film approaches banality. The Count's initial arrival to London maintains the spell of eerie suggestion&#x97;in one memorable sequence, he bites a young woman beneath a gaslight in plain sight of a throng of exiting opera patrons, who blithely dismiss the spectacle as youthful infatuation&#x97;but with the introduction of Van Helsing, ornate parlor rooms become the dominant setting for a series of conversations about the vampire mythos with explication firmly supplanting evocation. This jarring aesthetic disparity accounts for Dracula falling short of the tragic heights of Frankenstein, or the dedicated strangeness of the earlier, brazenly expressionistic Caligari. Yet there is one significant element that remains consistent throughout Dwight Frye's manic, pop-eyed performance as the tragic Renfield. Half-vampire/half-mortal, Frye remains recognizably human even when raving about the nourishing properties of the bugs in his sanitarium cell, never more touching than in his final attempt at redemption. His performance, oft-parodied but never duplicated, is the poignant strand that binds the picture's disproportionate halves.

It started a whole genre of horror movies including Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, and The Creature From The Black Lagoon. All these movies became major horror films which created original monsters that would be copied for generations in different movies.In this day and age Dracula is a movie that doesn't hold up well. The special effects were pretty weak, but of course you didn't have the technology that you have nowadays, so directors back in 1931 had to rely more on directing, script, characters, and atmosphere to make a great movie.Dracula has a great character in Bela Lugosi, and the man acted his chops off in this film. Renfield, as played by Dwight Frye, was also very convincing, but most of the others actors weren't as strong. The story begins on a carriage ride to Transylvania, and it is during this period at Dracula's castle and in Transylvania where this movie contains its best scenes. Once we leave the castle though the film slowly starts to fall apart. There were still a few scenes worth mentioning outside of Castle Dracula, like the scene with Dracula appearing in Mina's room, and the scene at the opera, but other than that nothing much more. It even ends very prematurely and we are left to wonder exactly what it was that happened, since we never see Dracula killed. We here a short shout, but nothing more. Still this movie had an impact on a generation and continued on through following generations, so it deserves some kudos.Other horror movies may come and go, but nobody ever forgets The Frankenstein monster, The Wolf Man, the Gill Man, and of course Dracula.

While this was undoubtedly an act of nepotism, it started the modernization of the Studio and just as the sound films was becoming the norm rather than the rule, Laemmle Jr. began the production of a horror film based on one of the most important horror novels of all times Bram Stoker's Dracula. Directed by Tod Browning, Dracula would be the beginning of the Universal Horror era, and the film that would make Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi an immortal icon of the genre.While the film was the first official Dracula in film (F. W. Murnau was unable to obtain the rights to the story for his 1922 silent horror Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens), several financial problems and the Great Depression truncated Laemmle's dreams of making a faithful adaptation, so writer Garret Fort adapted the Dracula play written by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston, which already had been a success in Broadway. The play was less faithful to the novel, but the core story was still there, Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi) is an ancient Transylvanian vampire who, aided by his new servant Renfield (Dwight Frye), moves to London looking for young blood. There he'll meet Prof. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), a man of science who is decided to stop Dracula.An experienced director of silent films, Tod Browning was already known for his taste for macabre and irreverent stories. Along with actor Lon Chaney he had directed horror classics like London After Midnight, The Unknown and The Unholy Three so the genre was not new to him. Dracula shows Browning going for a more mature and serious Gothic horror (it's for the most part void of comedy), showing a Count Dracula that is at the same time charming and terrifying. Just like his Count, the imagery he crafts is beautifully haunting, with the static shots and the lack of musical score enhancing this unnatural feeling of being stuck in time, pretty much like vampires do.Personally, the adaptation of the play version is not a favorite of mine (as it omits interesting supporting characters and situations), but considering the film's budget and the time the film was done it's quite fitting. The main problem I saw was that other than Van Sloan's Van Helsing, the heroes are very weak, and underdeveloped, with John Harker (David Manners) being the most damaged character. Still, the plot is quite well written and the essence of Dracula is still there.Three actors in this film have become legendary, and not without a reason, as Lugosi, Van Sloan and Frye completely own the film. Bela Lugosi is fantastic in the role that would become his own personal curse, portraying the Count with the dignity required for an ancient nobleman and the savage sex appeal of a vampire predator. Van Sloan is equally effective, as the scientist that represents the good values and moral of Victorian society. Finally, Dwight Frye gives the best performance of the film as the deranged Renfield, easily stealing every scene he is in. The rest of the cast is a mixed bag, ranging from OK to bad, although a lot of it can be blamed on the script that focuses entirely in Dracula's fight against Van Helsing.Tod Browning's Dracula is a classic without a doubt, but it's far from flawless. The static look of the film at times feel too stagy, and Browning is definitely not entirely familiar with the sound era (he would overcome this in the superior Freaks). The poor acting of some members of the cast is another little flaw, although in the end Lugosi and Frye make up for it. Honestly, the big turn off is not exactly related to the film itself, the main problem is that nowadays there have been countless versions of Dracula that this one may look dated to modern fans of the genre.While not the first Dracula (Murnau's film can claim that title), this film opened the gates to a new era of horror, and brought it to a wider audience that finally accepted it. Flawed and maybe dated by now, Dracula still holds up a certain unnatural magic that lures audiences worldwide, surrendered to the Count's charm and willing to do his bid. A very recommended classic. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Dracula A Study in Atmosphere and Sound","Date":"22 August 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Tod Browning was a director who could almost do-no-wrong. Warner had the Gangsters, Universal had the monsters, and movies made in the backlots were pretty good from the Great War-on. The onetime carny-barker was one of Hollywood's best directors in a period that is now legend. What is so remarkable about Dracula's staying-power is that this film isn't really scary, but is very forward-looking in its use of atmosphere and silence.Browning did the majority of his movies during the silent-era (seven with Lon Chaney), and it is known that he was one of the many directors in that transition from silent-to-sound who was afraid of the new technology. Dracula is a 75-year-old film, and it looks and sounds great for being made in 1931. And a surprise the Spanish-Language version is even more visually-innovative! The other crew that shot this version at-night saw the rushes of Browning's, and decided to outdo- them, and they did in many areas of their version. Most DVD-versions contain this version, and from some excellent-prints.Like the others, he feared that there would be a deemphasis on image, and this did happen with a lot of early talkies. The reason they were called talkies is because they weren't good, and all the attention was on how much dialog you could fit-in. Many movies became like filmed-plays, and a lot of hard-won work in creating a visual-language got lost for a time. Dracula doesn't suffer from this fate, however, because of Browning's fear of sound in films. This is why we still find Dracula watchable today, it isn't too-chatty and talky with too-much dialog that plagues many of the early-talkies (many-of-which are now forgotten and even lost).Utilizing the German-cinematographer, Karl Freund, the film has that touch of Expressionism. Freund worked with both Fritz Lang and F.W. Murnau, and Dracula is a visual-feast because of this. Karl Freund was DP on many of the greatest German Expressionist films, such as Murnau's The Last Laugh (1924), Lang's Metropolis (1927), and even Der Golem (1920). We have stunning dolly and tracking-shots that were uncommon in early sound-features, and like Lang's M, Browning's use of sound is sparse but effective. The absence-of-sound and the timing of where sound should be is very clever here, much like in Lang's M. Silence in both-films is often the prelude to something horrible--something Americans understood all-too-well in the heart of the Great Depression. A fear of war was also high, and isolationism and anti-immigrant sentiments were everywhere. Lugosi perfectly-embodies the American-fear of being overrun by immigration, and the actor was the very-thing! The character of Renfield is also interesting, being a fear of human-bondage to forces we do not understand.1931 was a bad year for Americans, so you have to consider this when you encounter the stories that women fainted and audiences screamed and yelled at screenings of this film. It was the worst year of the Great Depression, and to many, the world seemed to be ending. In a way, they were right, the world was going to change forever in a few-years. Some of it was good (the New Deal), and a lot of it was bad (the rise of Fascism and totalitarianism in Europe and Russia). From the Great Crash in the Fall of 1929, to the bitterest-year of 1931, Republican President Herbert Hoover did almost nothing to alleviate the suffering of Americans hit-hardest by the Depression. For this, he was overwhelmingly voted out-of-office, and his name has been a curse on the lips of the WWII-generation into our time.So angered were Americans by the Republican Party's decade-of-corruption, that they elected FDR three-times to the office of President, and the Democratic Party generally controlled Congress for over forty-years. No other American political-party can claim such a sustained-loss of legitimacy. Indeed, people were starving-to-death, and Hoover did nothing, these were uncertain-times. Nothing seemed to be what it seemed, and all assumptions about modern life were upturned. Horror and anxiety were everywhere as the Western world economy collapsed. Fear reigned, and Dracula was released into this storm of angst and anger. The timing couldn't have been more-perfect, and this is why the film doesn't resonate with us as much--it is a film of its time, very-much so. H.P. Lovecraft hated it, but when he wrote this to a friend, he was basically a white-supremacist, an anti-Semite, and a snobby, effete, intellectual-snob. He was also conservative at this time, but he had changed at the end of his life for-the-better.And so, horror is about the experience of generations. If you search-out what the other generations went-through, these films can be appreciated better. But, on a basic-level, Dracula is still a solid atmospheric-horror that was innovative. Its camera-work is innovative, as is its use of sound. And now, we have the good-fortune to have it restored with a new score commissioned by Univesal Pictures by American composer, Phillip Glass. If you truly want to enjoy this film, and to feel it more-deeply, it must be viewed with this score. Universal deserves credit for the new-score, it was a wonderful idea that works so well in-practice.Amazingly, Glass's score makes Dracula seem very modern and more-relevant to our times. The original had no real working-score (a few motifs), which is probably one of the few strikes against-it. Expertly-performed by the Kronos Quartet, Dracula shines as-never-before for our eyes and our ears. The restoration is incredible. After years of watching inferior 16mm television-prints, it is a revelation, this is a gem. At one time, it was hard to even see a lot of the movie, as it was murky and clouded, unstable. Watching it today, we can marvel at how good high-end film-making really was.

He's the only Renfield that I've seen that really brought the character to life and he really delivers a fantastic performance. If only there was a supporting category back in '31.The only thing that Stoker would be mad about is the deleting and switching of characters. In the book, it's Jonathan Harker, not Renfield, that goes to Transylvania in the beginning of the story. His character is much more developed and Renfield is pushed into the background.

And While there is much to be said for the stark bareness of the unscored original -- I have to say that the full background that music gives a film is probably essential for making this classic more accessible to modern audiences. Glass does a wonderful job of complimenting the atmosphere of each scene and I did not find the score to be detracting in any way. I enjoyed this viewing of Dracula as much as I ever have. I should have realized that a little music could not steal a scene from the hypnotic tour de force of Bela Lugosi, the enigmatic performance by Dwight Frye or Browning's lusciously decaying sets of sugary webs and crumbling vermin infested stones. Dracula (1931) is one of the moodiest and most unsettling films ever made-- despite the fact that there is virtually no on-camera violence-- only threat and menace-- which comes exclusively from Lugosi's rich presence. Each frame is like a work of art -- meticulously painted by Browning. Lugosi moves through that painting as if he were artwork as well.

The parts of the movie I have learned to love start at the beginning.  As Mr. Renfield travels through the ancient town at the foot of the Carpathians, the man with the huge mustache, when hearing of the young lawyer's plans, says with terror Drak-oo-la!  Renfield has that puzzlement on his face.  He can't understand the fears of the people.  I love it when he leans out the carriage window and sees that bat (on the end of a string), flying before the horses. When he is finally dropped off at the Borgo Pass, the suitcases are flung to the ground.  This guy should have got a clue, but he doesn't.  Then, of course, there are the famous lines as he enters the castle.  Listen to them, the children of the night.  The spider spins his web to catch the unwary fly, eh, Mr. Renfield.  That light is focused on Lugosi's eyes to make them stand out.  From that point on, we have a wonderful presentation of atmosphere.  The fog, the darkness, the suavity of the Count.  There is a sexual undercurrent here that is really provocative. The subplot of Renfield at the asylum, eating the bugs (flies, flies, why should I eat flies when I could have nice fat juicy spiders).  It is such a treat to watch the work of Tod Browning, using almost no soundtrack, still pulling us along.  Then there is Professor Van Helsing, who is almost as unsettling as the vampire himself.This was Lugosi's shining hour.  It's too bad Hollywood didn't meet him half way.

This was the first supernatural thriller produced by an American studio and its success spawned the whole Universal horror series (Frankenstein, the wolf-man,...) and in some way, the whole horror genre in American cinema. It crystallized the character of Count Dracula (the elegant gentleman dressed in a black cape, nowhere as it looks like in Stoker's novel) into popular culture and set the standard for all vampire films to come. It jump-started the career of Bela Lugosi. His interpretation of the count, with his heavy-accented and hesitant English, remains iconic.Yet Dracula is not a good movie, even by 1931 standard (compare it for instance, to James Whales' Frankenstein, released the same year). The first 20 minutes, set in Castle Dracula, are simply wonderful the atmospheric Gothic set serves as a perfect backdrop to Lugosi's performance. The scene where Dracula and his brides emerge from their coffins remains powerful even today.But once the action moves to England, the movie becomes am unimaginative bore. The Gothic sets are replaced by mundane well-lit rooms without any atmosphere, a context where Lugosi's performance suddenly appears quite goofy. I also always found Edward Von Sloan's overacted performance as Dracula's nemesis Van Helsing, extremely annoying with his fake German accent. Inspired more by the play than the original novel, the script is too talky. Moreover, Universal considered that a movie about a walking corpse was already extremely risqu√© and do not dare going to far with the script, hence most of the action seems to happens off screen. For instance, when Van Helsing and Jonathan Harker kills one of Dracula's victim who has turned into a vampire, we know it only because we see them exiting from the cemetery where she was buried.The movie is barely directed. Apart from a few scenes (like the one mentioned above with Dracula and his brides and attributed usually to cinematographer Karl Freund), Browning usually puts his camera at the least imaginative play, never moving it, adding to the feeling that we're not watching a movie but a filmed stage play. Browning's lack of interest in the project is also clear by the many goofs and mistakes that can be spotted through the film. The clearst example of that is Renfield's meeting with Dracula at Burgo's pass at the beginning of the movie. Dracula is driving the coach that will carry Renfield to the castle and, according to the script, a scarf around his head is hide his face, explaining when Renfield meets the count in the castle, he doesn't recognize him as the driver of the coach. Dracula wears such a scarf in the Spanish version shot at the same time but not in the English speaking version yet, despite this obvious goof, nobody bothered to reshoot the scene.Browning's later movie Mark of the vampire, with a much superior performance by Lugosi in a Dracula-like character, seems almost like an attempt to make-out for Dracula Mark of the vampire has all the atmosphere and Gothic imagery that Dracula lacks past the 20-minute mark. It remains influential but is, in the end, an extremely disappointing film.

However, there is a received opinion about the film's quality, and, as usual, the received opinion is correct.  DRACULA begins with twenty minutes of astonishing cinema, and degenerates into talky, stagy, stilted tedium.Well, when I say 'correct', I must qualify that.  There ARE great things in the second half a deranged performance by Dwight Frye as Renfield, by far the film's most interesting character, whose plight verges on the genuinely tragic; the consistently eerie cinematography of Murnau cameraman Karl Freund, who would later direct that unaccountable miniature, MAD LOVE; a remarkable, haunting play with mirrors; a splendid finale, which forswears conventional action and thrills, in favour of beauty, poetry and chills; and especially the astonishing sequence opening with a view of Seward's Sanitorium's lawns - this placid, classical garden is suddenly disrupted by the cries of Renfield, and the camera's smooth gliding jerks into an alarming mimicing of the insect the madman is trying to catch, utterly shattering the calm of a scene which, being set in a glorified madhouse, was always waiting to be rent.Overall, however, the second half is rather dull (maybe this is a comment on the England it deals with?).  You see, the film is not based on Stoker's novel, which is amazingly cinematic, rattling along at a hurtling speed, offering a profusion of characters and scenes in disparate locales, and providing plenty of colour and frisson, as well as using proto-cinematic techniques like cross-cutting and ellipsis; but a play based on the novel, a rigid, respectable, dead thing.  The book's primary motor is sex - Dracula is not simply an Other his desire for Mina is mirrored in the trio of her admirers; the latter's staking of Lucy Westenra is described as a horrifying gangrape rather than a righteous exorcism; the rampant homoeroticism of the book is also denied.  Instead we get one planklike lover; Seward becomes Mina's stiff father, (which, if you've read the book, does add a frisson of its own); and a rather asexual Count.The novel's tension between spanking modernity and technology, and submerged, Old World Gothic terror is ignored in DRACULA in favour of a vague Victorian fug.  The acting is almost universally (!) execrable, and, in the 'play' scenes, Browning unsurprisingly seems to lose interest.  What does remain from the book, and is actually intensified, is the link between the powers of Dracula and Van Helsing, both steeped in superstition, anti-modern lore, slightly complicating the battle between good and evil.All this is not to put you off.  Those first twenty minutes are treasurable, and unmatched in early talkie cinema, until FRANKENSTEIN at least.  Unlike Whale's awesome parodies, the opening is genuinely chilling, a terrifying trip into the unknown.  The journey to Dracula's castle is even scarier and more beautifully rendered than the otherwise superior NOSFERATU, filmed with a mixture of starkness and folk tale.  In these twenty minutes the spare, knowing, suggestive direction; the discomfiting lack of music; the evocative use of sound effects; the extraordinary set-design, dripping foreboding and evil; Lugosi's otherworldly face; the haunting and poetic use of ghostly imagery; the strange, oneiric permutations of the characters; all combine to created a dreamlike, horror masterpiece.

His Dracula has many admirers, and the Spanish version is considered by some to be a technical triumph. But I wonder what might have been if, in the late 1920s, Universal's top director Paul Leni had directed Conrad Veidt in the role of the Count. I have heard that Papa Laemmle wanted Veidt and Laemmle Jr. wanted Lon Chaney. Whether or not this is true, German director Leni and German actor Veidt had developed a rapport, teaming twice before in the the German film Waxworks and in The Man Who Laughs for Universal. If you want to know how much better the performances and camera-work would have been, watch these films.It was obvious in 1931 that Tod Browning, without his old pal Chaney, could not get excited by the project. Some in the cast gave German √©migr√© cinematographer Karl Freund credit for directing much of the film.But in spite of the troubled production Dracula was a box office smash. Critics, however, focused their praise on Freund's eerily atmospheric photography in the Transylvania sequence, commenting on the film's stiffness when the action shifts to London. Unsure of Lugosi's appeal, Universal hadn't risked any more than absolutely necessary on production, and Browning's lack of interest made the budget limitations even more obvious.You hear excuses for Dracula's staginess, but you only have to see the Spanish version to realize sound equipment didn't necessarily immobilize the camera. And it isn't enough to blame depression-era production cuts. The limits of a sound stage didn't limit James Whale's creativity on The Old Dark House. The film may have come alive if it had been made as a silent a few years earlier. In non-talking film you have to show the horrors; you can't convey horror through dialog as was attempted in 1931. Too much dialog makes any film static. Lon Chaney might have changed that. While his acting may not have matched Veidt's, his make-up would surely have been a revelation, and most likely would have followed Bram Stoker's description of the Count, his pallid aquiline face, his peculiarly arched nostrils, hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere, his massive eyebrows almost meeting over the nose, with a heavy mustache, and sharp white teeth protruding over his lip. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed.However, B-list directors seemed to have a knack for this kind of material. They never felt the subject matter was beneath them. Therefore George Melford, director of the Spanish version, was challenged by the project in a way Tod Browning was not. Later Browning, as if to prove he could match Melford, directed Mark of the Vampire, a remake of his own silent London After Midnight, with a flair that Dracula lacked, and followed it up with another stylish horror flick, The Devil Doll. Alas, Leni died of blood poisoning, Chaney died of cancer, and Veidt returned to Germany in part because he believed his German accent was too strong to appeal to American audiences. Irony of ironies, Universal cast Lugosi whose struggles with English are well documented. Lugosi quickly, and deservedly, faded into obscurity, and what might have been a cinematic achievement is nothing more than a cult classic.

Then the effects of the bats and spiders are obviously fake and attached to strings. I know it was 1931 and all, but I think they could have done better than that. Next, all of the performances other than Lugosi's and Frye's are very poor, since sound in film was somewhat of a novelty, and the actors were acting as if they were in a silent picture.

These opening scenes are the only ones taken from the book; after that the movie becomes merely a photographed record of a tedious stage play. As has been mentioned previously Universal originally planned to film Dracula as a super-production based entirely on the book and starring Conrad Veidt. Had the depression not killed those plans this might well have been the definitive version of the Stoker novel. Veidt was (to my mind) a better actor than Lugosi and physically better suited to the role, and as I said the first fifteen minutes show what a superb job Universal could do when basing the material on the book and not the play. As it is this Dracula is pretty tough to sit through. Hammer's version with Christopher Lee still captures the spirit of the source better than any other I've seen.

Murnau's Nosferatu, as well as the 1931 adaptation of Frankenstein, both of which did not fail to please. It seems this version of Dracula was the first popular one after Nosferatu, and came out the same year as the first full-length adaptation of Frankenstein, so it's hard not to compare this horror film to those two, and sadly, this one cannot compete.Renfield, a real estate agent, travels through the Carpathian mountains to the castle of Count Dracula to complete the Count's purchase of a home in London, England, despite warnings about the dangers of going to the Borgo Pass any time between dusk and dawn! What Renfield doesn't know is that Count Dracula is a vampire! While at the castle, the real estate agent is drugged by the vampire and becomes his slave! After Dracula arrives in London, he soon sucks the blood of Lucy Weston and successfully turns her into a vampire! After this, his next victim is Mina Seward! Technology has obviously come a long way in the past 76 years, and I realize that horror films from the early 1930s can seem very tame compared to more contemporary films of the genre. However, seeing 1931's Frankenstein and 1933's The Invisible Man, I also realize that they could do better than this at the time. This 1931 adaptation of Dracula is almost painfully listless, and sometimes mildly suspenseful, but rarely. It also has pretty much no musical score whatsoever, apart from during the opening and closing of the film, the acting is fairly weak (at least early on in the film), and the way some of the characters talk slowly is ridiculous! Horror films from around the time this one was released are obviously not the same to today's viewers as they were to their original audiences, but even with that in mind, this early movie adaptation of Dracula is disappointing. I had fairly high expectations when I rented it, but they were far from reached! Compared to the likes of other horror films from the '20s and '30s that I've seen, this one seems awfully amateurish. In conclusion, if you haven't seen this film, then even if you are a fan of old horror cinema in general, don't be surprised if you find this particular film disappointing!

The Francis Ford Coppola version was much closer to the book.BOOK; first few chapters are about Johnathan Harker's travels to and stay in Transylvania. Renfield already in madhouse by start of movie.MOVIE; Harker never leaves England, Renfield goes instead.BOOK; Madness seems to fluctuate. Sometimes he seems normal, sometimes he's even a philosopher, but once he bit Dr. Stewart's arm, screaming, Blood is the life! Blood is the life! But most of the time, either eating life things or catching flies, spiders and birds so that he can feed them to each other and later eat them. MOVIE; You don't see him acting sane much. (In an odd way, although it never happened in the book, the scene in the Mel Brooks version with Stewart and Renfield in the garden gives a much better example of Renield's frequent fluctuation between sanity and insanity.)BOOK; Dracula is described as an old man with werewolf-like features, glowing red eyes and a mustache, and gets younger as he drinks blood.MOVIE; Not even close. And, although fangs are alluded to, you never see them.BOOK; Dracula only ever converses directly with Harker.

As well as a child in a sack. (Note to MATRIX fans; watch Bram Stoker's Dracula again, you may find it interesting that Neo and Persephone have met) MOVIE; This happens to Renfield, but nothing interesting happens.BOOK; Dracula's arrival in England is very similar to Eddie Murphy's arrival in New Yourk in A Vampire in Brooklyn; a ship with a dead crew crash-lands on the beach, with a cargo full of boxes full of clay, and a wolf jumps out. MOVIE; Doesn't seem to happen.

But I was determined to find and read the novel beforehand, to learn less-known information about the most famous vampire...I almost regret doing this now (almost because if I hadn't I would've liked the film a bit more since, though I found it confusing WITH the book, so without it would've left me baffled but still entertained) because my experience of watching this was tainted. For those who don't know the novel's plot Jonathan Harker is sent to Transylvania to see a mysterious client of his company's, and there notices many odd things about Dracula he neither dines, drinks, nor reflects in mirrors, seems to covet human blood until prevented with a crucifix, is nearly nocturnal, seems to summon his neighboring wolves who prevent Jonathan from leaving, and intercepts 2 letters he sends home via gypsies and burns the one written to his lover Mina since it's shorthand. While defying his host's orders to sleep nowhere but his own room, he encounters 3 women who appear to be demons they nearly attack him till Dracula offers them a child. As he recovers from a brain fever in a nearby mental hospital, Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra witness a ship enter port whose only occupants are the captain, dead with crucifix-tied hands, whose journal mysteriously hints something caused his crew's disappearance, and a gray dog who flees after landing. Shortly after, Lucy's sleepwalking finds her nearly attacked by something unidentifiable to Mina, who believes the 2 marks on Lucy's throat are from the pin she used to tie her shawl - though Dr. Van Helsing, friend of Lucy's suitor Dr. John Steward, believes it's more when she continues to weaken after being given 4 blood transfers. After death her wounds heal, and Van Helsing reveals to Steward and her fianc√©e Arthur Holmwood that she is un-dead. With another of Lucy's suitors, Quincey Morris, Van Helsing summons Mina and Jonathan to confront the vampire responsible, and attempts to question Steward's insane patient Renfield, who appears subservient to a vampire - and must save Mina when she's attacked. The movie leaves out and/or changes much of the plot - Renfield is the business worker who goes to meet Dracula but returns possessed with him via ship. Jack Steward is Mina's father and her lover John Harker is too practical to believe in vampires, Lucy Weston is barely introduced and is interested in Dracula whom she actually meets, Arthur and Quincey are absent - and the suspense is reduced by Dracula's directly socializing with the protagonists in London rather than their having to hunt him down across the Black Sea, such as Van Helsing fighting his hypnosis in a battle of wits which occurs before he can convince anyone around him of what Dracula truly is. The Count's true identity - a descendant of an old Transylvanian family/Turkish War veteran who practiced witchcraft - was never revealed. Even Renfield's death is pitiful as he falls downstairs rather than dying directly from a beating. I was bored and managed to forget the ending, of 1 of the greatest horror films of all time, no less. I can safely say that if it hadn't been for Bram Stoker's work, I'd have been confused by the hurried plot, so even on its own merits - I try to give at least 5 stars to be fair - this film wasn't enjoyable to me. I wish I wasn't such a purist, but I thought this was beyond help either way. "},{"Title":"Vampires aren't scary.

The countless cutaways to Dracula's creepy eyes and the image of a the huge stationary bat flapping it's wings in the window became quite comical after a while as it became quite obvious that the filmmakers had zero trust in the audiences ability to infer anything about the story and needed to be told over and over again the the monster was scary and that he liked to watch people from windows.

They do this by simply revealing to much information and showing to much of the action and drama. (when you see a movie with so much gore, blood and violence). This modern style of conventional horror films is just to revealing and quite honestly just disturbing. It transforms the movie from being scary, eerie and/or spooky to just down right disturbing, gross and revealing. In doing that, we as the audience have no room to imagine or re-create the plot and story. But the wonderful genre of horror was not always like that, classic horror films can be some of the scariest movies ever made because they keep the horror aspect of the movie very hidden so by the climax it can completely unexpectedly surprise you. That's what makes a good horror, it's what you don't see that is truly frightening. Dracula is a perfect example, this movie was not to revealing and that's what made it so spooky. (Plus Bela Lugosi's classic stare of death is just one of the scariest images in cinema).

Most of the acting is pretty ham-fisted and most of the bit players are relics of the silent age blabbering on about vampires loudly, wide eyed and waving their arms around dramatically. Bela Lugosi completely owns the Dracula role, he is Dracula and not even Gary Oldman can take that away from him. Its his role and his role only. He brings a great intensity and theatrical flair to Dracula, he'll reach almost silly heights with his voice and then suddenly he will just change into an intense monster which sometimes can come as a shock to the viewer because this transition happens so rapidly and so unexpectedly that you barely have any time to brace yourself for what happens next. When they go to England in the film the acting gets better and the film begins to move along pretty well.There is no background music, just an unsettling silence and the silence is only broken by rare background noises or talking. The silence and the almost always static camera shots that linger almost too long on certain disturbing images enhance the creep factor of this movie. The creepiest camera shot I think might have to be the shot of Renfield standing at the bottom of some stairs looking up at the camera and laughing insanely. The film is covered in shadows, huge ominous shadows that slither along the sets or completely envelope characters. Browning also tries for a bit of realism especially in the early scenes with the peasants, they seem to have real accents and some actually speak in Hungarian. The set pieces are pretty big for the most part and creepy as hell. The special effects by today's standards are pretty lame and they tend to rely on using things off screen like a noise or someone talking about something happening off screen. There are also a few instances of blatant cut away techniques, like Dracula walking towards the cobwebs, cut to Renfields shocked reaction and then cut back to Dracula on the other side of the cobwebs.This is a pretty good movie. Its a little slow at times and some of the acting is either really bland or its really ridiculous. Lugosi keeps things moving along though and steals every scene he's in. Its really a shame that he didn't go on to have a better career because he really was a talented actor who was typecast because of his accent.

The make up I thought was amazing for that time; it definitely helped Dracula look like a vampire. I really adored the costumes/outfits they wore because they look so real and official looking. That cape looked so heavy, warm and like such good quality They would be awesome Halloween costumes! The lighting played a big role in making this movie what it was; it made it look suspicious, dreary which is the perfect weather for this type of movie and mysterious; the fact that it was in black and white made it that much better (I never thought I would say that!). Another aspect I found interesting was the accent Dracula had because they were in England and everyone else had an English accent however Dracula had a different accent. Either way this is definitely a great movie to watch for Halloween!

Upon reaching London, he goes after lovely young Mina (Helen Chandler), while Renfield is confined to an insane asylum and all the ship's crew are dead.Director Tod Browning is a master here and the film has a crisp look well beyond its years. While he may also be known for Freaks, there is no doubt Dracula is his feature work. Likewise with Bela Lugosi, who defined the look of Dracula forever... making the creature more sensual, less monstrous.The man who deserves a good bit of credit is Dwight Frye, who plays Renfield. I have always felt the Renfield character was one of the best in the book, and often the most impressive on film (see Tom Waits in the Coppola version). Frye sets the bar high for crazy henchman types.Dracula is so ingrained in American pop culture that despite seeing it for the first time only now, there was no scene that did not already seem intimately familiar to me.

Many actors have played Dracula since Lugosi originated the role in Tod Browning's landmark horror chiller, but only one has matched Lugosi. Christopher Lee portrayed the immortal fangster seven times for Hammer and a couple of times for other producers. Ironically, Lugosi only played Dracula twice during his disappointing Hollywood film career. Seventeen years later in the twilight of his career, Lugosi donned the cape to play Dracula in Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Although Browning's movie introduced one of the most popular horror villains in cinematic history, nothing about Dracula is remotely scary. First, Universal Studios made the film so as to not incur the wrath of the Hollywood Production Code or offend pious church groups. Second, Dracula never bares his fangs. Furthermore, we never see the infamous vampire feeding off his prey. After all, he couldn't have kept his evening clothes looking pristine if he got blood splashed all over himself from draining a rebellious human of their life essence. Third, when Van Helsing stakes Dracula in his coffin at the end, this important action occurs off screen with only the anguished groans of the Count to let us know that the vampire is dead. Originally, the Production Code Administration had Universal remove these sounds of death. Indeed, Metropolis lenser Carl Freund photographed Dracula, and he makes this nonsense look genuinely atmospheric. The close-up shots of an unblinking Lugosi as Dracula with pen lights brightening his lupine stare make this vampire look appropriately intimidating.Initially, the studio sought Lon Chaney, Sr., for the part, but cancer claimed Chaney before the great thespian could make the film. Lugosi landed the role for a minimal $500-a-week and he never topped Dracula, though he came close with White Zombie. Eventually, he would thrive in Poverty Row studio chillers and comedies and ended his career in director Ed D. Wood's preposterous Plan 9 from Outer Space. Browning went on to make the controversial Freaks with genuine freaks about intrigue and murder in a small traveling circus. Universal produced Dracula for about $341-thousand, but curiously enough they neglected to capitalize on their surprise hit until four years later when they produced Dracula's Daughter with no Lugosi in sight. Granted, Van Helsing had destroyed the Lugosi monster in the first film, but later films dismissed this consolation to realism. Lee's Dracula reconstitutes himself in virtually all the Hammer films. Dracula opens with a long shot as a real-life, horse-drawn stagecoach threads its way through the Carpathian Mountains. Renfield (Dwight Frye of The Doorway to Hell) is a London real estate agent who has come to Transylvania with a lease for Count Dracula to sign. Renfield is riding with several other passengers when an anxious native explains that they must reach the inn before sunset. It is Walpurgis night, the night of evil. He pauses and then continues, Nosferatu. On this night, Madame, the doors-they are barred and to the Virgin we pray. Meantime, at the inn, the workers are reciting the Lord's Prayer in Hungarian. The coach pulls up at the Inn, but Renfield has no plans to stay. I say, porter, don't take my luggage down. I'm going to the Borgo Pass tonight. The innkeeper struggles to persuade Renfield to remain until sunrise the following day because the coachman is frightened. Renfield explains that a carriage awaits him at midnight at the Borgo Pass. He adds that his destination is Castle Dracula. The innkeeper warns Renfield not to enter Castle Dracula. We people of the mountains believe at the castle there are vampires! Dracula and his wives. They take the form of wolves and bats. They leave their coffins at night and they feed on the blood of the living. Renfield discounts all this hokum. He believes they are all superstitious, something that Renfield isn't. The innkeeper's wife thrusts a crucifix into Renfield's hand. If you must go, wear this for your mother's sake. It will protect you. The crucifix was a standard weapon in any vampire hunter's arsenal. In this 1931 production, the crucifix can stop a vampire. When Universal Studios remade Dracula in the 1970s with Frank Langella, the crucifix bursts into flames in Dracula's presence. Renfield swaps stagecoaches at Borgo Pass and rides off to Castle Dracula. The coach is making good time when Renfield peers outside and sees a huge bat flapping its wings in front of the horses as if it were leading the steeds. Once they reach the castle, Renfield searches for the coachman who is nowhere in sight. Of course, we know from the instant that we saw the coachmen that he is Dracula and can shape-shift. Renfield enters the imposing but dilapidated Castle Dracula. The count guides his guest through the cob-web infested premises to more comfortable quarters. Dracula scrutinizes the lease to his future home in Carfax Abbey. Afterward, Renfield cuts himself accidentally with a paper clip. Dracula darts forward impulsively at the sight of blood on Renfield's middle finger. Just as he closes in for the kill, Dracula shrinks backwards in revulsion at the sight of the crucifix that topples onto Renfield's bloody hands. Later, Dracula bites Renfield after the head vampire has scared off his three wives. Dracula boards a sailing vessel, the Vesta, for London. He arrives in London and tours the town dressed up in a silk top hat and a cape. He approaches a flower girl and bites her, but we are shown nothing. Dracula introduces himself to Dr. Seward, Jonathan Harker, and Professor Van Helsing at the opera house. Not long afterward Dracula strikes and kills Lucy (Francis Dade of Raffles). The mirror scene where Van Helsing exposes Dracula is good. The count exits the premises as a wolf so nobody will follow him. Later, Van Helsing and Harker track Dracula down and kill him in his coffin. Dracula qualifies a spooky classic horror thriller.

Some might also object to the many departures from the original plot. But for me the one and only reason to watch this film is the alternate Philip Glass score. I'm a fan of his music anyway but what he has accomplished here is to put it simply, outstanding. He has imbued a film that by modern standards is rather simplistic and at times even laughable with freshness and magic. The dialog and the plot are almost irrelevant.

I enjoy many films by Browning and West of Zanzibar is nearly a masterpiece, but his work here is transparent and uninspired. Simply comparing this film to the Spanish-language proves how flat it is and how much it lacks cohesion due to the terrible editing. George Melford's direction in the Spanish-language version, shot on the same sets and released in the same year, is so superior to Browning's work that you begin to wonder why Universal didn't switch directors once they saw footage Browning shot.What the Spanish-language version doesn't feature, however, is Bela Lugosi. It does star Carlos Villar as Conde Dr√°cula, though, and the less said about that monstrosity of a performance the better. Lugosi is still quite possibly the definitive Dracula, and so many moments here capture him in all his glory. Dracula is worth seeing not simply because it is a film with an important legacy but merely for Lugosi's take on the Count. He really is superb here. Dwight Frye's Renfield is also excellent.Dracula is far from a perfect film. It's also pretty far from being the sort of classic many claim it is. It really is nothing more than a middling, average filming of a great play with a great lead performance. Thankfully the script and acting save this film from the inexplicable ineptitude of Browning's work here, and the sheer lack of cohesion in the flow of the film.6/10 "},{"Title":"Creatures of the night... what music they make","Date":"26 July 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Tod Browning's Dracula suffers so many decades later for one simple reason, and a second one that's more subjective first, we all know Dracula, like a quintessential Shakespeare or Jack and the Beanstalk, we all know what Dracula is about because the lore is given to us as kids and it's taken as it is, which leads to a lack of surprise at what will occur in this film (lets face facts, some of us have even watched the Coppola Dracula before this one); second, it is, sadly, dated in some aspects. Luckily, for the latter, what makes it dated doesn't really have a negative impact on enjoying the picture overall- when one sees the bat flying about- or, sorry, swiveling and nearly crashing and breaking against the scenery- it's cheesy and corny and all those things that show it was 1931.But aside from these minor liabilities, Browning's film succeeds because of, to use the oft-repeated and tired description, atmosphere (make no mistake, a chill will run up your spine as fog rolls in and Dracula appears to suck the blood of poor Renfield), and Lugosi's monolithic performance. Has any actor come close with just a deranged look in the eye and Hungarian/double-jointed curl of the fingers to acting this creepy? While Max Schreck and Klaus Kinski, both playing/inhabiting Nosferatu in those film versions, could arguably be considered far more creepy, Lugosi has the aid of sound and a odd control of the English language that adds just that necessary edge on a scene. So many years later, it's the definitive performance of Lugosi's, for better or worse this turned out for him.Back to the atmosphere though, as the only other truly notable and crazy turn among the sturdy cast is Dwight Frye as spider-eating/schitzo Renfield. The sets, the lack thereof a score, and the mesmerizing lighting and gliding camera-work of Karl Freund (who, apparently, directed some parts of the film), not to mention the moments of fog, make up much of the classic quality of the picture. This side, even so many eons later it seems, hasn't aged too badly, and practically all variations of Dracula or vampire movies only come a hair's edge close to imitating or emulating the Gothic stature of the technique presented here. Even when a scene of dialog might lack some density due to it being mostly pure exposition, it's impossible to take your eyes off what's going on or being less than absorbed in the action. No matter how familiar, Browning's Dracula deserves all its accolades and attention as the first Hollywood movie on the Count. Whether or not it's the greatest of all time I'm not sure. 9.5/10 "},{"Title":"Fantastic!!!!!!","Date":"25 July 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I love classic horror and the reason for me collecting the old horror films is Bela Lugosi's role in Dracula (1931).

Bela didn't know much English but his heavy Hungarian accent has been mimicked countless times. My favourite parts are when Dracula says to Reinfield I never drink........wine and when Reinfield does his insane laugh aboard the ship. Dwight Frye portrays Reinfield amazingly.

The great Tod Browning's Dracula of 1931 belongs to all three categories. Generally speaking, this is neither Browning's best film (that honor goes to Freaks of 1932), nor is it the best adaptation of Bram Stoker's great novel. The most ingenious film about the Dracula legend is still F.W. Murnau's silent masterpiece Nosferatu - Eine Symphonie Des Grauens of 1922 , the most entertaining is the Hammer Studio's Horror Of Dracula (1958) with Horror dream-team Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. However, this most famous version of 1931 is absolutely essential for one reason - the great Bela Lugosi. The immortal icon Lugosi delivers one of the most remarkable performances ever in a Horror film as the bloodsucking count. Lugosi does not only play Dracula, he becomes Count Dracula. From the first moment of his appearance, Lugosi immediately dominates the film, and he does not cease to do so whenever he is seen. Other than brilliant, breathtaking and unforgettable, here are hardly any appropriate words to describe such a wonderful performance - performances like this have to be seen! I don't find it necessary to deliver a plot description, as I assume that everybody knows the Dracula story. Bram Stoker's brilliant novel has been filmed on various occasions, some of the adaptations (such as Nosferatu, Horror Of Dracula, or this one) were excellent, others (such as Bram Stoker's Dracula of 1992) were quite lame, and all of them differed from each other quite immensely. There is little action in this interpretation of the story. What makes this film tense is the overwhelming presence of Bela Lugosi, as well as a wonderful black and white photography, eerie sceneries, and a gloomy and menacing general mood. There is hardly any music, just the eerie and unforgettable tune in the beginning. The film's one small weakness is a middle part in which little happens. This tiny fault, however is easily made up for by the film's eerie atmosphere and the brilliantly haunting Bela Lugosi. What makes the difference between a great actor and an icon? To me, what makes an icon is the predestination for certain roles, which no one else would be even imaginable to play. This is definitely the case with Bela Lugosi in the 1932 Dracula. In Short This is essential cinema. An absolute must-see and a classic that no film fan could possibly afford to miss.

After spending years watching and ploughing through the history of silent films, 'Dracula' now comes on like a mind boggling ground breaking wonder! How it must have terrified audiences in 1931!Of course, we know the minuses it doesn't follow the book, there's too much off stage action, Tod Browning's 'direction' is weak, the male lead is feeble, the acting is too stagy (especially by Van Helsing), and there's not enough Lugosi, etc. But consider the pluses they get better with every viewing! Even after 76 years! The first sound version of a 'grotesque and horrible theme' (=the undead drinking blood to survive); the pioneering way of presenting it-- laying the groundwork for countless versions to follow (including the vast, bleak, decrepit castle); the eerie, creepy, atmospheric use of silence (the lack of music was not unusual for films of 1931); the scary, creepy editing; the amusing Charles K. They're all cry-zy Martin; the amazing work of Dwight Frye (including his floor crawl towards the maid), who would have stolen the film if it hadn't been for Bela's imposing presence; and most of all, the manner, movements, voice, dialog and delivery of Bela Lugosi himself. Whew!The Universal Legacy collection's David Skal informs us that the depression caused Carl Laemmle to scrap plans to film the book in favor of the popular play. In the book (published in 1897), Jonathan Harker is the solicitor dispatched to Castle Dracula, where he becomes trapped by Dracula, whom he sees turn into a lizard, and whom he also tries to kill before Dracula leaves Transylvania disguised as Harker; Renfield is already a patient in the sanitarium; and Lucy is beheaded in her tomb by Van Helsing and her lover, after her many nightly kills as the Woman in White (this latter part being mentioned in the film). Too bad we didn't get any of it in the film!In fact, while the fate of Lucy as a vampire is left out of the Lugosi version, it is present in the Spanish language one (included in the Universal Legacy Collection), in its more exciting climax. Speaking of that version, produced at the same time and on the same sets with the same costumes, and mostly the same script, it comes off as a wonderful, more detailed, variation of the English version, with additional scenes, dialog, and a really great Renfield. A fuller version visually and story wise, but... no voice of Lugosi.I haven't seen all of Lugosi's films but my favorites are clearly, 'Dracula'(1931); 'White Zombie'(1932); Lugosi amazing as Ygor in 'Son of Frankenstein'(1939); as the romantic hero and star of the serial 'The Return of Chandu' (1934); and his speeches (Pull the String!) in Ed Wood's 'Citizen Kane''Glen or Glenda' (1953).As Skal points out, in no future Dracula movies did 'The Count' try to imitate Bela Lugosi, but as viewers we would always hear his voice, see his mannerisms, and measure the current actor against Bela's being conspicuous by his absence. So finally, watching this film takes you back to a genteel, drawing room world, where the gruesome theme is treated with skeptical normalcy and decency (not the horrific silliness and unbelievability so prevalent in modern horror films). When Renfield opens the door of Dracula's castle and introduces us to the world of evil we now know all too familiarly in our own time on and off screen, it's a ground breaking moment in the history of cinema. For all the pluses in it, this film just gets better and better!

Apologists for either extreme position can express,debate and rehash their cases. We can all listen, but this is the sort of feeling for particular type of film and the Particular Era that gave rise to them. For the most part any debate winds up to being a case of preaching to the Choir, with like minds proving to be both The Preacher and The Preachee at any gathering or forum of ideas.In our own case, we prefer the Old School horror film. We enjoy the Black & White Photography, both in the 'Movin' Pichers' as well as in the Movie Stills. The varying tones of grays, whites, silvers and blacks make for the perfect visual accompaniment and underscore to the moods to be conveyed. Also the compatibility of B & W with any sort of Archival Program has made it the favourite choice medium for news files. Black & White cinematography sends subtle, sub-conscious messages which adds a certain perception of being authentic.As for Sound vs. the Silents, we'll leave that debate for another day. Suffice it is to say that the Silent Screen provided us with so much really great and frightening films. We had so many of the German Films, John Barrymore as DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE and so many unique and eerie Characterizations of one Lon Chaney* as examples.As for Dracula (Universal,1931), we have been familiar with this cinematic version of the Brom Stoker tale, ever since 1957. It was in that year that Universal Pictures released its SHOCK THEATRE package of their Horror Masterpiece(and 'Boobie Prize')Films. This was the moving factor in creating a new Local TV Station Position, that of the 'Late Night Horror Movie Host Personality' This was period of having people made into overnight successes as being the Host/M.C. of the SHOCK THEATRE films. The most famous being John Zacherle as Roland who started at WCAU, Philadelphia before moving on to WABC TV, New York. Virtually every market had its own Magnetic Conduit Character/Host, acting like a Lightining Rod in drawing the viewers to their telecasts.In our own local Chicago SHOCK THEATRE as seen over Local ABC TV Affiliate, WBKB TV(now known by the call letters of WLS TV). Our show was hosted by a bespectacled, dark suited, flat topped character called Marvin. In real life he was one Terry Bennett, a talented Ventriloquist and Comedian.So, we had the old sound films, and in this case, the older the better. And none 'older' nor more frightening than Bela Lugosi as Dracula. The sets, the Transylvannia scenes, the Castle Dracula, and the long periods of silence on the sound track all help to add up to a hauntingly eerie screen presentation. And in Dracula's case, the quiet times added to say, the three Vampire brides of the Good Transylvanian Count, only prolong the horrors and tend to personalize them.Among the fine supporting players who helped make this the classic that it is and always will be, we have to mention Edward Van Sloan (as Van Helsing)who gave us both the wisdom of the older Scientist and Expert on the phenomenon called 'the Nosferatu',the 'undead'.(Yeah, this guy really uses the term in the story!) But of all the rest players we have to give proper praise to is Mr. Dwight Frye(Renfield). He had the proper intensity and off beat insanity to bring the role of the unsuspecting servant. And he possessed the most haunting stare, which when combined with his crazed laugh, provides the most horrifying of experiences.And ironically, Dwight Frye did not initially done these creepy characters in horror films. In fact this scene stealer of Dracula, FRANKENSTEIN(also '31) and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN('35)was not a film actor at all. Mr. Dwight Frye was a Stage Actor. And the Forte of this most notorious 'Professional Creep' was, the same as Sydney Greenstreet's, which was the Musical Comedy! We recently obtained a DVD of the original Universal 1931 Dracula with the newly created original score. We enjoyed the experience. This score is definitely tailored to this Dracula film and this one only. It is lively, moody, highly atmospheric and does underscore the action of the story.And you know what? The original Dracula with no music to speak of beyond the opening Title Theme(an eerie adaptation of Swan Lake by Tchaikovsky)is much better. I really prefer the creepy, quiet stretches of soundtracks, punctuated by the occasional dialog by Lugosi, Van Sloan or Frye. Even the crackling of the old soundtrack and old equipment was part of the old experience.What's more, I've incorporated the technique into my own Nightmares, shown and dreamed in Black & White, of course!NOTE * Universal Studios boss, Carl Leamele had planned to make Dracula a project starring as the Transylvanian Count.

I certainly believe this is a crash course in how to shoot Gothic horror the real way. The opening is just astounding with all the cobwebs, possums, the lady vampires and how they submit to their awakening master, and Lugosi appearing for the first time in all his splendor. His eyes, as the light glistens upon them, wreak of power and lust..whoever faces these eyes have to submit their will to his. Few weak minds, if any, can outlast the power of Count Dracula. Such richly macabre dialogue stands etched in horror lore from, I bid you welcome, to The blood is the life, Renfield..each line becomes so eerie when rolled off the tongue of Lugosi. Some consider Lugosi's performance hammy, but I just revel in the way he stretches his dialogue..it becomes so quotable. Lugosi was simply born to play this creature of the night and when someone says Dracula, some might think Chris Lee, but most envision Lugosi with his vile stare that penetrates the very soul. His equal, let's just admit it, is Dwight Frye as the crazed Renfield, once quite a sane, intelligent, soft-spoken office type reverted to a blood-thirsty maniac because of Dracula. It's that fiendish, stark-raving madness that is so intensely memorable..no one can match this performance, so why even try? But, it's the way director Browning and cinematographer Karl Freund set up creepy darkened shot after creepy darkened shot of Dracula waiting out in the darkness commanding others to do his bidding that makes this such an endearing horror classic. Some might think Edward Van Sloan might be a bit too theatrical as Van Helsing, but I can't imagine anybody else in that scene where Dracula tries to pull his rival towards him with mind control only to find his adversary's will is too strong even for him.My favorite scenes, to be honest, occur in Transylvania before the film settles in London because the castle and way Lugosi is shot are so burned in my mind. Just the way Dracula looks inside his decrepit abode on the stairwell as he stares at Renfield with that fiendish blood-lust so apparent or where we see an armadillo climbing from a coffin with this skeletal hand peeking ever slightly out. Or, the scene where Renfield receives his ride on the horse carriage as Dracula hides enough under a black cloak to remain anonymous..each Gothic set-up is a hypnotic entrapment for the fan in love with the moody set up of atmospheric horror. I watched this with the Philip Glass score and must say I prefer it..something majestic occurs when we hear the eruption of strings as Dracula appears. The score, for me, takes away the creaky criticism that so often accompanies one's insult towards it.

True, it moves a bit slowly and is choppy at times, but it is still a great movie. From the haunting strains of Swan Lake, to the innovative shots of the horse drawn carriage as it heads towards Dracula's Castle, to Dracula's eerie welcome, to the creepy crypt shots, and so on, it's worthwhile watching. Bela Lugosi, of course, defined Dracula for generations to come. I had never heard of Dwight Frye prior to seeing this movie, and was very pleased with his amazing performance. At first I thought he was Jonathon Harker, as he was the one arranging for the sale of Carfax to the Count. I thought it was a mistake that he was called Renfield, but then realized that was the way the movie was done. I've so far, in my Dracula education, found Jonathon Harker to be singularly unappealing, but Dwight Frye's rendition (in this sort of duel role) was fantastic. When later on in the movie, John Harker showed up, he was, (for me anyway) as boring and lackluster as ever. This movie is a must see for any student of Dracula, and should be on all collector's shelves.

The Broadway production brought together the two talented stars of this film who went on to bring it to the screen, Bela Lugosi (Born Bela Blasco from Lugosi in Rumania) and Edward Van Sloan (the only Dutch Actor to date who has played the Dutch professor Van Helsing.) To round out the superb performances of the cast is Dwight Frye as the tortured and maniacal Renfield, reduced to being Dracula's creature.In 1999 this wonderful horror classic was re-released with an all new music score by composer Philip Glass performed by the Chronos String Quartet, which adds to the tension of the film.

Although perhaps not the first vampire film - many regard Nosferatu (1922) (which, by the way, was a more horrific interpretation of a vampire) as the first - it is clearly the most popular. When one thinks of Dracula, you think pale face, black cape, eerie, spooky settings, mist, the thirst for blood, Trannsylvainia - and that's exactly what you get in this magnificent version of the classic tale of Dracula (a role that Bela Lugisi was born to play).The plot is simple and well known... Dracula is a vampire and thirsts for blood. He travels to England with his newly transformed sidekick Renfield (Dwight Frye) and sets his eyes on Mina, an engaged young woman.In my opinion, no one plays the part better of Dracula like Hungarian born Bela Lugosi, who acted in the stage version. Strangely, he was not the first choice for the film role, but he won it eventually. I believe he was the perfect choice and brings the essential strange, chilling element. His ominous, eerie presence... his long, thirsting, desiring stares and generally his intriguing and often sexy performance as Dracula. His unforgettable articulation and his mysterious entrancing tone of voice are just perfect. Imagine anyone else saying I am Dracula....I Bid You Welcome! The best thing about this movie is how wonderfully it created the dark, chilling atmosphere unparalleled by any other movie on such a tiny budget. A great example of this is at the start where Dracula's brides slowly creep out. Their emotion is truly haunting. This doesn't have the now typical 'boo!' moments of modern horror flicks but I would not miss the hypnotizing performance of Dracula and the eerie settings. This is the movie that set off a whole generation of vampire movies, but I believe this is the greatest of them all. It makes others pale in comparison. Great to own on DVD.

Because the term wasn't invented until Dracula, a huge box office hit, forced Universal Studios into making another horror film to follow it. 75 years on the impact Dracula had upon the audience is difficult to understand - we live, after all, in an age of blood, gore and sadistic horror. What would 1931 viewers have made of Hostel? Dracula remains the Grandaddy of all horror films; its opening reels are eerily magnificent, as we accompany innocent traveller Renfield (Dwight Frye) through the Transylvanian countryside, arriving at Castle Dracula in his bat-driven coach to deliver the deeds to Carfax, an old abbey in England, to the most infamous Hungarian nobleman of all time. We know what's in store for poor Dwight, as we have already glided softly through the castle to alight at Dracula's coffin as he emerges, brides in tow, to prepare for the arrival of his guest.In the opening twenty minutes the template for the horror film is laid out for all to see - the moody atmosphere, supernaturalism alive and well in our world, and the superstitious villagers' mounting dread as they discover Renfield's destination. It's a superb beginning, from the stately camera-work of Karl Freund to the man in black awaiting on the stairs of his castle for his visitor; and his chilling opening line I am...Dracula. I bid you welcome! Bela Lugosi has become for millions around the globe the definitive vampire. The role he was born to play he makes the most of it, all leering smiles,looming presence, penetrating stares and his old European cadence used to disturbing effect. Lugosi is more suggestive of evil than a thousand modern psycho-slashers.It's a great shame that the rest of the movie does not live up to this opening, which adapts the American stage play rather than Stoker's book. Once the action moves to Dr. Seward's asylum the film becomes static and talky, with shots held for far too long on several occasions. Tod Browning, the director, reportedly lost interest a few weeks into the production and turned over many chores to Freund. Yet Dracula's drawing room confrontation with Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) holds the interest, and you simply can't take your eyes of Bela.I confess a genuine affection for this film. Costing around $330,000 dollars to make, it scooped over a million back for its studio and was its biggest hit of 1931. Watch it late at night, with the lights out, let its strange pacing and macabre atmosphere take grip, and it will still hold you in thrall. Horror fans owe it so much. It was the first of many Universal horrors, and it's still one of the best.

Based on the Braqm Stoker this film version was adapted from the 1927-1928 Broadway play. Bela Lugosi reprises his role from the stage play written by Hamilton Dean and John L. Balderson as Dracula in this film version and Herbert Bunston reprises his role to film of Dr. Steward from the same play. Director Tod Browning was successful in a number of films he directed in the horror genre in the Devil Doll and Mark of the Vampire. He also directed the unusual film about circus freak show performers called Freaks. Browning got his directing start in the early days of silent film and was also a successful writer and had written the story The Hypnotist that he adapted to the Lon Chaney film London After Midnight. Chaney was to star as Dracula in this film but he died before the film began and Browning turned to the original Broadway star of the play, Lugosi to star in the film. the role of course made Lugosi a household name but typecast him in the role and similar vampire roles for the rest of his career. Austrian-born cinematographer Karl Friend who had a long career as a cinematographer, director and producer photographed this film. He had come from the German Expressionist movement of film-making and had photographed Fritz Lang's Metropolis among many others. his career would include such films as The Good Earth, Camille, conquest, Key Largo and The Pride and the Prejudice and he received several Academy Award nominations and also went on to be an innovator in television film. As a director Freund directed the classic The Mummy. Among the cast are Helen chandler, David Manners, Dwight Frye and Francis Dade.

And of course there are Lugosi's ominous vocal intonations, still instantly recognizable to many people almost seventy-five years after the film's initial release. That's a pretty remarkable feat. Purists may quibble that Lugosi was a little too solid to match up to Bram Stoker's written descriptions of the Count, but Lugosi's brilliant acting overcame not only those discrepancies, but what would otherwise have been a lousy and forgettable film. If you want to see what this film could have been with some decent direction and supporting performances, you'd better view the Spanish language version that was shot simultaneously with the Lugosi classic.

From his first words muttered on screen - I am Dracula... I bid you welcome - Bela Lugosi sets the brooding, menacing tone that pervades throughout the film, heightened by each sinister close up as he measures his victims. What better way to greet agent Renfield, than to describe the howling of a wolf outside of Castle Dracula - Listen to them... children of the night, what music they make. The Count makes Renfield his first victim, who now swears allegiance to his Master, surviving the ship voyage to England by devouring ants, flies and other small creatures for their blood. Dwight Frye's portrayal of Renfield is accompanied by a diabolical, guttural cackle that portends more misery to come. Upon arrival in London, Dracula makes himself at home at Carfax Abbey, adjoining the grounds of the Seward Sanitarium where Renfield is placed upon his discovery as the lone survivor of the Vesta's ocean voyage. From there, he casts his sinister eye on potential victims. In turn, the Count's presence is signaled by a flying bat or the howl of a wolf, creepily suggesting unspeakable horror.Contemporary fans of modern day horror films may find Dracula slow moving and even boring, but I find the pacing to be measured and deliberate. Even Lugosi's speech pattern, delivered with over enunciation due to his newness with the language, is perfect in defining the Dracula character. You come to believe it when The Count proclaims - There are far worse things awaiting man than death.

Any that has the Frankenstein Monster and/or the Wolf Man; George Robinson's lighting; Salter, Skinner or Waxman's music and Universal's trademark backdrop settings; and it's fantasy land I can revisit over and over.But unlike the others, 'Dracula' hasn't aged as well. It's near unanimous that the film's opening reels are a staple in horror history. But after that it becomes a yawner. Too stagy, too talky...and too bad! It could of (and should have) been a definitive 'Count' movie, but like the book, its midsection becomes terminal. It's forever unfortunate that Universal didn't give Lugosi the role for 'Son of Dracula', 'House of Frankenstein' and 'House of Dracula' (and also his proposed involvement in 'Dracula's Daughter' before negotiations fell thru), because he's much more relaxed, smooth and three dimensional in 'Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein'. What a contribution he could have brought to those other films.Part of the reason why Dracula doesn't go over as well is (maybe it's a guy thing) that I never saw the Count as a romantic, hypnotic, smoothie. Dracula is first and foremost; a monster with rank breath, powerful strength and evil cunning. And I never bought the accent either. If actors like Meryl Streep, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearse (and even James Doohan) can master any accent after a few years in the acting profession; you'd think that Dracula would be capable of the same skill; after all he's over 500 years old (in the book Jonathan Harker flatters the Count about his English being excellent). But Lugosi (who had recently just learned English) has influenced other interpretations including Frances Coppolla's Dracula and the more recent Van Helsing...unfortunately it remains a camp imitation. It worked in 1931 and the ensuing years of re-release and TV airings, but it just doesn't cut it now.As for the Phillip Glass score; did he bother to run the film while composing??? I thought I had a tough time staying awake without the music; this was an instantaneous ass kick from the sandman. Thanks to the score, I'll never have a sleepless night again. Ten minutes and forty three seconds and I'm down for the count(no pun intended).Still moody and creepy...but too slo-ooo-ow for me.

There doesn't really seem to be a good reason to write Van Helsing in the first place.2) Plot deviations- for instance- Dr Seward should be Lucy and Nina's contemporary, but he is portrayed as Nina's father. Renfield is unrelated to the rest in the story and is separately recruited by Dracula, but in movie he acts as the real estate agent (Jonathan Harker's role)...3) Religious undertones- Dracula is a story about an anti-Christ who is resurrected to undeath rather than to life. The parallels to Christ are numerous- he lives after death, he is both corporal and spirit, he must be invited to enter a house while Christ bids us to invite Him into our heart, etc and the contrasts are also important- he hates light where Christ is the light of the World, he gropes about in darkness, he seeks to destroy, he pollutes blood.Bela Lugosi's acting is superb, almost too good. The book's Dracula is repulsive while Lugosi is suave.

Still, old school horror has a key charm that today's standard's severely lack.  I love the old films for their slow pacing.  Now it's a requirement to have X amount of bodies in X amount of minutes and X amount of false scares and X amount of real scares. . . and it usually amounts to crap.  Old school horror, real old school horror, had class, it had atmosphere, and it had very strong visual style. Does it make you jump?  No.  Does it scare?  Not really.  But it does leave impressions in the mind, which is more than, say, Dracula II Ascension has going for it.Bela Lugosi plays his inescapable role here, one that would define the portrayal of Dracula for decades to follow, and one role he'd play again and again all the way until his final role for director Ed Wood nearly thirty years later.  But there's always something intriguing watching the original performance . . . seeing where all the imitations came from and seeing why all the imitations followed.  Much has already been said about Lugosi and much more has been said in the countless imitations, so I'll not waste my breath repeating it here.Actually, Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing caught my attention more than anyone else (including Lugosi).  Once again, Van Helsing may be the thick-accented half-mad professor whom we've seen dozens of times in the films, but in 1931 I imagine it wasn't quite the clich√© it is now.  Van Sloan and Lugosi have a nice on screen, gentleman's, rivalry; together they bring the central conflict of Stoker's novel to life.And it's interesting because this conflict has a sense of almost Shakesperian stage elegance (granted, it was adapted from the stage play and Lugosi was the big name stage-Dracula at the time), but it's performed on film sets which gives it a strange surreal nature.  Even the little rubber bats bobbing up and down outside the windows add to that surreal charm Dracula possesses.One last note, though, I do find it very interesting how many film critics will bash a newer film for an off-the-wall bit of dialogue regardless of if it fits the character or not.  It's like only classics have the right to stop for apparently no reason, gesture to the outer wall and say, `Listen to them, the children of the night . . . what music they make.'

Based on Bram Stoker's immortal literary work, Dracula is one of the earliest genre pictures that still holds up today.  It's been referred to as the strangest love story ever told, but that's not why I enjoyed it.  I enjoy it because it made a legend out of one Bela Lugosi.  Bela Lugosi is one of horror's leading men that can never be forgotten.  He is a true horror icon.  Lugosi's Dracula is a suave, lady's man who is probably the most charismatic Count ever to grace the silver screen.  He's a handsome, rich, and powerful figure, everything that a woman could want.  The man's a lady-killer, literally.  There is also a presence about him.  When he is first shown and the camera zooms into him slowly, his eyes are exotic and hypnotising.  He's just intense.  If Lugosi provides the heart of the picture, Tod Browning's near flawless direction and pacing is the brain.  He's a brilliant director and knows how to captivate his audience.  I love his use of shadow.  Bela's face is always hidden, only his eyes are revealed in the light.  It's an extremely creepy effect.  Another unusual aspect of the film is the lack of a soundtrack.  I can't make up my mind about that (I plan to watch the re-released version in which a score was added and compare the two).  Browning has created some standout scenes here as well.  The first scene is when Renfield first arrives at Castle Dracula and walks through the spiderwebs.  Dracula says The spider, spinning his web for the unwary fly.  Renfield has no idea how true this is.  The second occurs when Van Helsing is examining Miss Mina's bite marks.  He is enquiring what caused them and the maid announces Count Dracula when Bela enters the room.  It's timed perfectly and it makes me laugh out loud.  My only quibble with this presentation of Dracula is that all of the action and gruesomeness is offscreen or hidden.  Whenever the Count kills someone, he shrouds them with his cloak.  He is also destroyed offscreen, everything is hidden.  It's the climax of the film and we don't get to see it.  I suppose this reflects the day and age and my own desensitized youth though.  All later presentations of Dracula would date back to Lugosi's legendary performance.  He was so attached to the role that he would be buried in his costume.  At Lugosi's funeral, fellow screen legends Vincent Price and Peter Lorre paid their respects together.  It is rumored that Lorre said to Price upon viewing Lugosi in his Dracula outfit in his coffin Do you think we should drive a stake through his heart just in case?

Watching DRACULA is very much like watching a stage play.  There are no camera zooms or pans. The camera is static.  This gives the viewer (especially the modern viewer, so used to flashy camera work) an uneasy feeling.  It's one of those situations where something just doesn't feel right, but is subtle enough that you can't quite put your finger on it.  Another technique that has a similar result is the use of no musical score.  Other than a brief scene at the opera where the music from the stage can be heard in the background, there is no music.  This is especially effective in creating an eerie, creepy atmosphere.Bela Lugosi is obviously the star of the film, though he was given the role only after first choice Lon Chaney died prior to filming.  Lugosi gives the title character a cruel elegance, lots of style and sophistication. Despite this, his eyes really can project evil.The remainder of the cast is made up of what would become part of Universal's A team for horror films.

Legend has it that director George Melford would screen the English dailies and make improvements as they went along.  There are those who say the Spanish version is better, more atmospheric than Browning's static, stagebound film.Well&#133; the Spanish `Dracula' has a lot going for it.  The camerawork is much more mobile and expressive the scene where we first meet Dracula is a prime example.  In the English version, we simply see Dracula walking down his castle's grand staircase to meet Renfield; in the Spanish version, the camera's point of view swoops up the stairs and frames the Count in a dramatic low-angle pose.  I particularly enjoy the way the Spanish version shows Dracula emerging from his coffin the coffin lid raises, a puff of smoke, and Dracula appears out of the gloom, much more atmospheric and innovative than the cutaways used in the English version.The acting is a mixed bag.  Carlos Villarias does his best, but his Dracula pales to Lugosi's (many have said that a `Dracula' directed by Melford and starring Lugosi would have been a wonder to behold, and they might be right).  Lupita Tovar makes a sensual and appealing Eva, contrasting favorably with the bland Helen Chandler in the English version.  Eduardo Arozamena does a credible Van Helsing, but his potato nose and Coke-bottle glasses makes him look like Henry Kissinger, Vampire Hunter.From a stylistic viewpoint, the Spanish `Dracula' does a lot more than Browning's film, and it's certainly worth a viewing.

They guy playing her fiance was terrible, but then he was another stage stiff who didn't belong in front of the camera.Loved Renfield, though it honestly took me awhile to figger out it was the same Soddish guy who had gone up to the Drac Castle in the stagecoach. Quite a change in persona, eh? The whole 'Master/Slave' thing there made me wince, ala bad visions of the Village people showing up-but ya hadda love the bug eating stuff.Rubber bats on strings, a stake pounding, some eerie 'off camera' sightings of wolves, Drac nails 4 or so gals on the way through the film-seems to me that this had it all. And ya have to admit, the ghoulish Trio harem of his was kinda risque for 1931 too.So what do I give it? The fiddler-gone-kookoo score was OK but irritating at times, the slow parts dragged-yet I was never once put off or bored.I give it *** bites outta ****, Drac is at the heart of it, and it is definitely worth yer time.

The first real, talking horror film that launched a genre and started a trend no one could imagine at the time. But truth be known, this is not a very good film. Bela does an ok job and utters some great cinematic lines, but the movie is without a doubt extremely slow moving and very wooden. After a promising and atmospheric start, the second half comes to an almost complete stop. The sets are impressive but the one, standing, non-moving camera work gives one the feel that a stage play is being filmed thus reducing the pace to almost zero. Dwight Frye's Renfield is a joy to behold but the cop-out ending when Dracula is staked OFF-SCREEN really puts the capper on a hard to digest viewing experience. I will give Tod Browning and Dracula kudos for launching Universal's horror factory but purely as a film, this one falls well below par. Universals next pic Frankenstein became a much deserved bigger hit then Dracula and as a matter of fact Universals follow up to Drac, Dracula's Daughter was a much better film then Lugosi's.

For a film that's constantly praised for its visuals, Tod Browning's direction does nothing to open it out from the stage play on which it's partly based, preferring instead to bore us with a series of agonisingly static scenes in which characters stand about in rooms doing nothing.This movie may have given cinema an iconic character in its visualisation of Count Dracula &#x96; every kid ever to do a vampire impression has used Bela Lugosi's accent &#x96; and the film is undeniably influential, but, like Boris Karloff's creature in the same year's similarly over-rated Frankenstein, Lugosi has very little to do besides stand still and stare a lot while someone shines a torch in his eyes. Like Karloff, he's given better performances in better (and worse) films than this, and here he's pretty unremarkable.He sure does better than the rest of the cast though. Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing has the unenviable task of slogging through lumps of dialogue about the vampire mythos and Dracula in particular, convincing the other characters with very little effort that Dracula can transform himself into a bat and a wolf. Helen Chandler and David Manners, as the lovers whose romance is rudely interrupted when Dracula bites her on the neck, are as bland as you like and fail to make you care about them. Everyone else is either the cockney comic relief so beloved of '30s horror or overact so chronically that it makes you wonder how this was ever considered scary.There's one good bit, which is where a couple of characters are musing about who could be responsible for the neck-bite deaths and the next words we hear are Count Dracula as the maid shows him in. Aside from that and what charm Lugosi can muster up in his one-dimensional role, there's not much to it. I've never been a huge fan of this story but surely there are better versions out there than this one; with the stolid cast, the bats on strings and castle Dracula done up like a students' Halloween party, nothing here has survived the transition from 1931 intact.

Frankenstein has aged a lot better. The camera angles and the dialog are awkward and underproduced even for a 1930's movie. Additionally, most scenes tend to drag along becoming very uninteresting. Don't expect to be able to follow the plot easily unless you have read the novel. This film may have been terrifying to audiences when it was originally released, but today it lacks enough suspense or action to startle a toddler. Bela Lugosi get so much praise for his role as count Dracula but I think his performance sucks the whole way through and found it hard to stay awake.

The story, of course, is great; and when combined with Tod Browning's directorial vision, and a career best performance from the great Bela Lugosi, it's hardly surprising that the 1931 version of Dracula is the most enduring version of the classic tale of all time. This is the film that, along with James Whale's Frankenstein of the same year, ensured that Universal studios would always be remembered as one of the major forces in horror cinema, and deservedly so. The classic story starts off with a man named Renfield travelling to Transylvania to finalise the sale of Carfax Abbey to the mysterious Count Dracula. It's not long before Renfield is going insane and looking after Dracula on his sea journey to England. In England, Dracula becomes obsessed with the beautiful Mina, and after sucking her blood, her father calls in the scientist Van Helsing, who discovers the cause of Mina's problem...Even though he only played the role once on screen (not including a role in the comedy Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein), Bela Lugosi managed to get his name forever associated with the character. His Eastern European accent and melodramatic persona ensure that nobody has ever delivered a more memorable performance as the great vampire, and many believe that there has never been a better Dracula than Bela Lugosi (although I've got to admit that I prefer watching Christopher Lee in the role). Tod Browning's direction is assured and perhaps the most striking thing about it is the lack of a score. Browning's lack of music ensures that the film has a slow pace, but this also makes it very eerie; with the only sounds present being the actor's voices and the creatures of the night. When combined with the thick Gothic atmosphere, we have an environment that is perfect for this sort of Gothic horror story. The story of Dracula is incredibly famous, and I wager that there's barely anyone on the planet who doesn't at least know the basics of it. This does harm the film a little, because it means that you always know what's going to happen - but it's a small criticism of an absolute classic horror film. There are some films every horror fan must see, and this is one of them.

Now, the opera cape, the tux and evil leer are part and parcel of the Dracula image which has become indelibly stamped in everyone's mind.

Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake works very well as a haunting opening theme and the initial scenes in Transylvania as Renfield goes to pay Dracula a visit evoke an air of real impending menace. The sets for Dracula's castle are still superb, and with Bela Lugosi starring as a very effective vampire Count then you can't help but wonder why the director couldn't make these scenes work more effectively - instead they are a little pedestrian. There's still that awkward feeling though - there in this ruined castle high in the mountains, full of cobwebs, lives Count Dracula who is dressed like he's about to go out to the opera. This mode of dress is fine when he's mixing with the rich socialites in England, but here?The scenes on the ship as it sails in treacherous waters to England are brief in this version of the film and nowhere near as effective or creepy as they were in the earlier Nosferatu, although this part of the film does give us the first glimpse of Renfield's descent into madness - Dwight Frye's laugh is truly scary.As the action shifts into Dr Seward's Sanitorium the whole thing becomes much more stagey - long scenes of dialogue with almost static direction and a total lack of incidental music. The lack of music is made even more noticeable by the audible hiss and crackles on the soundtrack. Thankfully Edward Van Sloan gives a strong performance as Professor Van Helsing and makes these scenes more interesting than they might have been without him and his interplays with Lugosi are highlights in this middle section of the film. But it seems as though the director was conscious of working within a budget as many of the most interesting moments happen off-screen, such as Dracula turning into a wolf (wolves are frequently heard in this film but never once seen on screen). Curiously even simple actions, such as Dracula getting into or out of his coffin are avoided - perhaps they could only afford one cape and didn't want to tear it?The climax of the film is more of an anti-climax - considering Van Helsing has already spoken of killing Dracula by driving a stake through his heart, when he comes to do it there is surprisingly little resistance he simply breaks into the abbey where Dracula is hiding out, opens the coffin and does the deed. There's virtually no suspense in it whatsoever.Lugosi, Van Sloan and Frye aside, the acting is at best average and we have to suffer some stereotyped cockney accents. But one of the film's saving graces is the dialogue - there are many memorable lines, some of which have rightly gone down in film legend.So Dracula is okay, but you can't help but wish someone like James Whale had directed this film, given the fine job he did with that year's best horror film, Frankenstein.

I loved Christopher Lee and I WORSHIP Bela Lugosi in the part. Bela Lugosi doesn't play Count Dracula...he is count Dracula. I've never seen a person so appropriate to play a character. His eyes...his body language. Those elements make the entire movie. A legend was born in 1931 with this film. It'll be told many times but never again shall it be so magical with the use of so less material. In fact, there are no effects or make-up ( except the face of Bela ) and this is one of the only movies that doesn't need that. The things that are suggested are frightening enough. It must have been a great thrill to see this movie when it came out back in 1931. I would have loved to be there. I surely wanted to live the feeling of fear when Bela looked you straight in the eyes from the big screen. The story is known by everybody.

Mina's beloved Jonathan Harker fights back and also the very bright Dr. Van Helsing who seems to know a lot about vampires. He's the only one who can beat Dracula but the time to do so is limited since Mina is already under the influence of Count Dracula. This movie is part of the great Universal monster classics. Brought out in the same year as Frankenstein (starring Boris Karloff) this film made a little less impact on me, but still it's an undeniable masterpiece. The atmosphere hanging around it never saw an equal. I didn't knew anything the further life of Bela Lugosi until I saw Tim Burton's film Ed Wood.

The modern strings jar badly with the creaky old picture, subconsciously distancing you from the action. In fact, they go together like Keanu Reeves and a decent acting performance.Continuing the Universal tradition of an abrupt set-up, meandering middle and uncertain end, the opening rushes through a plethora of folktales and crucifixes. Maybe it was subtle at the time, but poor old Renfield (Dwight Frye) can't walk an inch without someone telling him the owners of the Count's castle are vampires. Much of this is due to its age, a factor for which it cannot be criticised. So I won't mention the obvious studio backdrops for exterior locations, the rubbish shaking carriages and pathetic bats on string. There, that's that settled then.The direction is staid and rigidly blocked, and it's generally acknowledged that the simultaneously recorded Spanish version is technically far superior. However, the saving grace of this picture is said to be Bela Lugosi in the titular role. With a performance clearly indebted to the silent era (we even get an on-screen caption seventeen minutes in) Lugosi creeps about like Max Schreck, possessing all the insidious menace of Julian Clary. Anyway, turns out old Drac can't go anywhere without someone shining a spotlight in his eyes, a fact which drives him to drink the blood of all and sundry. (Though to the film's credit, the only blood you see is a cut thumb, the rest is all implied). Look out for the scene where he glares balefully at Lucy in the royal box - doesn't he look like he's suffering from constipation? Dracula is eventually defeated by a stake through the heart. Steak? I would've thought ham was more appropriate...It's the sort of thing that could have been superb under the reins of James Whale, his direction moulding it into the camp classic it cries out to be. As it is, it seems to be one long exercise in melodrama, with Charles Gerrard chucking in a cod Cockney to Frye's wild-eyed vamp victim.There are some brilliant moments though. Like when Lugosi (Despite the campness, superbly charming) is seen, or rather not seen, through a mirror. And while not standing up with the best of the studio's output, its iconography puts it well above the usual conveyor belt fare.

What have we already established?  NOSFERATU and DRACULA (Spanish Version) are superior.  Bela Lugosi, Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan are priceless. First half is classic, essential viewing.  Second half is duller than dirt. Phillip Glass  Beautifully moody at first listen, painfully repetitive on closer inspection.  Biggest (unintentional) laughs  The rubber-bat-on-a-string and David Manners.I suppose there's just as much to like in DRACULA as dislike.  If you're an avid historian of film or a fan of horror/monster movies, you without-a-doubt have to see this film at least once.  If you consider yourself only an average movie-buff, it won't kill you to miss this one.By the way... my personal favorite line/delivery in DRACULA?  Dwight Frye as Renfield  Dracula?  Dracula?!  I've never even HEARD the name!  Cracks me up every time.

However, as with most adaptions, the original story has been butchered, and the remains moulded into a surprisingly weak script. Lugosi is fine as the seductive, menacing count. However, we see some shocking overacting from Dwight Frye as Renfield (before and after he goes mad). But perhaps I am examining this from the wrong viewpoint In 1931, this film had people turning green and marching briskly out of the cinema. It now seems theatrical and dated. Despite Frye`s performance, the first quarter of the movie is great, with impressive, atmospheric sets of Dracula`s castle. The cobwebby, crumbling rooms were brilliantly constructed. However, when the count arrives in London, things slow down considerably.  This movie is worth seeing, but don`t expect anything great It`s highly overrated. Overall, 6/10  "},{"Title":"Extremely Overrated","Date":"19 June 1999","Score":"7 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  For some reason, this film is considered a classic. This was adapted from a stage play and it shows. It is very slow moving with most of the sets so dark that the viewer has a difficult time making out the players and scenery. I loved Bela Lugosi in most of his subsequent roles, including those as a Dracula clone, but each time I sit down and try to watch this film I find that it simply cannot hold my attention and I am forced to give up and do something else.

I thought it was a 3 hour movie, it was only about 1 hour ! The acting is very bad. The sound is very bad. There is no action. There is no good scenery. The actors talk so slow, that I think it was intended for people with either bad hearing or the mildly retarded. Even the newspaper clip was held on screen for a few minutes, did people read slower back in 1931 ? There are only about 9 people in the cast, and they forget about Lucy. I guess in 1931 they couldn't count too well either. Then there's the scene on the ship which is rocking wildly in a storm, and Dracula is standing perfectly still looking at the crew. Ooops, I guess they thought the audience wouldn't catch it. I could go on, but whats the use. This movie is so bad, I now appreciate the crap that is in the theaters today. "}]
