So naturally, I'm going to watch this movie expecting to see Jerry Springer Uncensored.  First of all, Jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's running time.  The other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo-farce about trailer-trash, jealousy, incest and deception.  Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer-trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather (a very unusual-looking, chain-smoking, drunken Michael Dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona).  The mom finds out about the affair, they get into a fight, they want to take it to the Jerry show (that's right, no Springer).  And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple.  They take it to the Jerry show.  The characters collide.  Blah, blah, freakin' blah!  Trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG!!!!  I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans, yet none of them checked out his movie.  Well, now it's TOTALLY obvious!!  Whether you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie!  How can I explain?  It's a total mess of a motion picture (if that's what you call it).  It's so badly edited, with scenes that just don't connect, and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the map!  Just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce.  With seldom laughs.  My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene.  That's as risque as it gets.  Don't get me wrong, the scene's pretty risque, but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on Springer's program--this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitized.My score  3 (out of 10)     "},{"Title":"Not horrible, but certainly not good","Date":"6 October 1999","Score":"14 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This wasn't the major disaster that I was expecting, but that is about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie.

While he tries to explain the popularity of his show, several groups of guest arrive for his newest show. Angel lives in a trailer with her mother and stepfather &#150; but is sleeping with him! When her mother Connie finds out she gives Angel's boyfriend a blowjob in revenge. Meanwhile Starletta catches boyfriend Demond sleeping with both Vonda and Leshawnetta. The natural step for both groups is to appear on Jerry's show &#150; even if it makes the conflict greater.I started watching this film once but didn't review it because I gave it up as a bad job once it turned into nudity for nudity's sake, however I decided that I'd give it another try despite my better judgment. Of course, it is not any good but this is not to say that it was one of the worst films ever made because it wasn't. The plot focuses around two sets of trash that emulate the guests on Jerry's real show and this is part of the problem. The characters here seem to revel in ignorance and trashiness and it makes it hard to really care about any of them. This isn't helped by the fact that they have no real story to speak of &#150; their bits are set up and then they all flirt/fight in the hotel on their way to the recording of the show.Not enough happens to justify a 'story' so called so it resorts to 'sexy' clinches, fighting and vulgarity.It is a shame because the film does have a few interesting moments &#150; although you wouldn't think it from the reviewers on this site. One interesting point is the character of Connie; she is damaged and hurt and wants more than the vulgarity she has &#150; but when the fighting and swearing happens, this interesting part of the character is forgotten aside from a few all too rare sensitive moments. The film has a few interesting lines about the show but it doesn't throw itself open enough, instead it uses its platform to defend itself and attack its critics; I don't mind it doing this but there was no balanced view to be had here &#150; although it is hard to disagree with Jerry's speech near the end that defends the fact that people are like this&#133;even if we don't like it. Parts of it are a little funny but this, and some other qualities are just lost in a plotless film that is vulgar rather than interesting and noisy rather than really funny.The cast are average as you would expect from the material they are given. Hagan manages to create a few good moments but she is betrayed by the film for her good work. Pressly is very sexy &#150; even as white trailer trash! She doesn't have much to do apart from be sexy, so it is just as well that she does it well. Robinson, Ambrose and Micheaux have all done some good jobs in other films/shows but here they are loud, brash black stereotypes and they embarrass themselves. Why action star White bothered to do this is beyond me, he has nothing to do apart from flirt around and get to kiss a couple of girls. McNamara is pretty good and sends himself and the show up equally well. Springer is so-so and he overdoes the 'world-weary' thing and never lets interesting moments, where he seems bothered, go anywhere of value. Like the material itself, the cast throw up some OK moments but these are lost in a sea of bad stuff.Overall this is a bad film although it has moments that show it could have been more interesting (if not actually good per se). However, without a decent plot the interesting ideas/moments only occasionally float to the top by chance but the dominant qualities are ones of vulgarity, cheap titillation, fighting and ignorance &#150; none of which are reason enough to watch it.

However, I probably would not have seen it had I not had my arm slightly twisted.In my opinion, this movie shows just how depraved man can be.  In my eyes, the worst thing about this whole Springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the Jerry Springer Show act as they do (which in itself is eminently reproachable), but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose that includes me.. to whatever extent it is true).  If not glorifying that kind of behavior (as some might say) at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and/or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior.But enough soapbox (sort of). Here's the skinny the movie has an R rating, and while it may deserve only that (I did look away at some scenes, so I'm not completely sure), I feel that an NC-17 (tip of the hat to the other reviewer) might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content (a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen).  The plot is very bizarre, tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different Springer shows.  At the end, the movie leaves one with some resolvement- and Springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world (evidently as seen through his show).  I agree with him there- it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change.  Having said that, let me just tell you- the world's pretty bad- glance in a newpaper or the news to see that, but let's not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic titallition that Springer seeks to give us.

The film would be better off if it were, because at least the worst film I've ever seen, (Prom Night II) interested me enough for me to hate it. My only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when I looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed. It had seemed much more like years.  It is an endless repetition of poor people, (or what Jerry Springer seems to believe poor people are), screwing each other, hitting each other, insulting each other, and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing. The plot, which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the Jerry Springer mill, advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters.  This makes it impossible to care what happens to them. It never mattered to me whether they got on the show, or what they said, or who slept with whom. Maybe I'm not supposed to care about them.  Maybe I'm supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type-- to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny.  Too bad it isn't.  The humor is not outrageous.  It's innocuous.  It's predictable. Humor has to have something behind it, some kind of painful irony or life experience, in order to function.  Scatology is not wit.  An example.  A mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed.  To take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter's boyfriend.  Since I was over the shock of Jerry Springer's show a long time ago, I had the same reaction I had to Andrew Dice Clay's obscene nursery rhymes; not laughter, just yawning. Lastly, I found Springer's pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing. If he really were an advocate of the poor, he would bring on a single mom from Bed-Sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in New York City on $12,000 a year.  Or, failing that, he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits.  Jerry Springer gets millions for his shows, his movie, his book and videos.  His guests just get round trip air fare, hotel accommodations, and a chance to humiliate themselves.  If he liked poor people so much, he'd give them at least some of the money they earn for him.  It appears that Springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself. Jeez, with all his fine work, you'd think he'd have earned our respect already. Anyway, the film is weak and boring. It doesn't even succeed at being offensive. If you want to have a better evening, videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that.

Based on the few clips I've seen over the years, I have nothing but contempt for the infamous talk show itself, but it is clear that the folks behind this project had a threefold objective 1. to defend and explain the show's appeal 2. to probe the mentality and motivations of a typical guest and 3. to still deliver the kind of sleaze and silliness the show's fans have come to expect. Amazingly enough, the movie basically connects on all three levels. What is most surprising about Ringmaster is the amount of compassion it has for its (at heart) extremely sad, lonely characters - where a guest spot on Springer's show will be, for most of them, the absolute pinnacle of their abysmal lives. The movie also argues that, whatever else you might think of them, these people have guts, they're fighters - they won't be doormats for anyone. The best performances are given by Jaime Pressly and Wendy Robinson, both of whom throw themselves into their roles with complete and often hilarious abandon. Their profanity-laced tirades are, frankly, very funny and very um, vivid. (Especially Robinson's Linda Blair comment.) Sleazy and trashy, to be sure, but smarter than you'd think and maintains a narrative drive all the way through - unlike so many other TV shows turned into films. With the show's popularity on the wane by now, this represents a more lasting monument, if defaced and defiled, of the whole Springer sensation.

While his show is undeniably offensive and stupid, it also gives us a chance to see that, relatively speaking, most of us have it real good. When you look at the trailer park livin', dollar whiskey drinkin', incest lovin' people on the Springer show, it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park. Jerry is performing a public service, and we should be grateful. He ditched a political career to host the show, just for us.What we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie Ringmaster. Ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show, or so they would like us to think. The movie follows the pre-requisite Springer story line Love triangles. One triangle involves Connie, her daughter Angel, and her husband Rusty. The other involves Starletta, Vonda, and Demond. When the two hapless groups meet up in LA, their lives intertwine and collide head-on, all culminating in an explosive episode of the Springer show. It's like what Short Cuts would be if Robert Altman had had a severe crack habit.Ringmaster is true to the show, as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish. It also makes me very glad that I don't live in the squalor it's characters do. But the movie has a problem. It's billed as a comedy, but it just isn't very funny. What laughs there are to be had are few and far between. Maybe some people watch this and laugh non-stop. If you think blow jobs and rape are funny, well then I guess you're one of those folks. Personally, I laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of white-trash life.The Jerry Springer Show just isn't meant to make the leap from TV to the silver screen. What's funny in an hour long show (less, when you count commercials) isn't necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie. Movies have to tell a story, and that's something else Ringmaster has trouble with. The story is threadbare. There are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder. And even if there weren't such problems, how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story? Even the Hollywood formula couldn't make this better. Ringmaster is so bad, it even screws up the best part of the Springer show the Final Thought. Somehow, even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built around.The worst offender in all of this is Springer himself. He's such a bad actor that he can't even play himself convincingly. Watching Springer play Springer is sad. It's like he was going for a 'What if Woody Allen played Jerry Springer' vibe, and he failed. Miserably. He went to the trouble of producing this disaster, the least he could do is try to make it just that much better.Not that I'm saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance. Just the opposite. They all suck. Not so surprisingly, no one in this movie went on to greatness. The best any of them was did was Molly Hagan landing a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom. Apparently, Nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the '90's to star in a children's program. It makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts.Here are my Final Thoughts What we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn, who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience. Should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely brain-damaged lumps of goo? I say no. Somewhere out there, in this crazy, mixed up world, there is a perfect movie for each of us.

He's the facilitator. He lets the poor speak out and be stupid. The working class has a hero and it's Jerry Springer. He is the Ringmaster.So to give some background to all these human freak shows that run across the TV screen, we get to see the guest's life stories. Here is where the movie gets a little interesting. Jaime Pressly is the hot babe in the trailer park who sleeps with her step dad and a lot of other people.Jaime Pressly is the living embodiment of sex. Other females look away in shame. It's no wonder her step dad wants her. Her nakedness is what propels this movie into more than just a flick about guests on a trashy talk show. OK. OK. It's not much more than that but Jaime Pressly is still volcano-level hot.  If you like seeing Jaime Pressly getting it on, (and what sane man doesn't?), check out this flick.

I guess jerry springer doesn't play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show (yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show) and he is only known as jerry in the film. The plot (if you can call it that) is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mother's live in boyfriend. So the mother's brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughter's boyfriend. (Is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park). Meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her cheatin' man with her friend in bed together. So of course call america's therapist Jerry springer! I'd talk about the rest of the film but even thinking about the film now is giving me a headache. Jamie Pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie. And remember Michael Dudikoff the kick ass karate master from the american ninja series? Well take a look at him now as a white trash drunk. The thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it getting in touch with his charecter.

This movie has no plot, no laughs, the worst acting and editing I've seen in years, and the tacked-on, phony moralizing Jerry puts on is a travesty.  If he at least had the guts to say something like Hey.  I make trash for people to watch, and they seem to enjoy it, so sue me.  at least people would respect his honesty.  Instead, this freakshow manager tries to put on airs as a voice of the average man or woman. Speaking on behalf of the average man, thanks for NOTHING, Jerry.  Not just poor, amateurish filmmaking, but an absolute insult.P.S.. Yes, Jamie Presley is an absolute beauty, and I pray she will survive this to be seen again soon.  (She DESERVES to be seen, if you get me.) And tell Molly Hagen that she's actually a good actress and it's a shame she's in this filth.

I am drawn to his show like one is drawn to a car wreck, you don't want to look at it, but you can't help but watch.  I have waited several months for Ringmaster to finally come out on video since it never made it to the theater here in my hometown.  After watching it last night I now know why it didn't make it here.  It's terrible, awful, horrible, enter your adjective of choice here. The plot is nonexistent, I didn't care about the characters and the language makes a Quentin Tarantino film look like a Disney film-and that's one of the classic ones like Snow White or Sleeping Beauty.  If any aliens in outer space happen to run across Ringmaster in watching our world, we need never worry about them ever making contact with us.  Take my advice  rent Pulp Fiction instead!

Springer gets very little screen time in his movie.  A white trash family gets more scenes than the black characters.  Why is that?  On a sleazy level, it does not work.  However, it is good for a few laughs.  If you're a true Springer fan, you may enjoy the fights and offbeat trash talking.  My evaluation ** out of ****.

After poor white trash mother finds her daughter in bed with the girl's stepfather, the mom has sex with the daughter's fiance and both women becomes excited when they're appearing on Jerry. Along for the ride is a black woman having fun with her best friends who slept with her boyfriend that ended up tagging along to appear on the show. Jerry is given less screen time than the latter in this sometimes funny, utterly morbid, and an unusual statement is given on the things that people do to get on this show. But nevertheless, this film is crude, trashy and pointless. Close to the end where Springer lectures that people want to see real people and their dirty little lives then get beat up is very unconvincing - Jerry Springer Show is 100 percent SUCKSVILLE. But some people find this crap entertaining, then let them have their fun - even though there aren't many of them (proves the 9 million dollar gross this film made - what a big bomb). No this film is not graphic enough to be NC-17, then shut up ya cry-babies. I have a handgun ready in my hand so I can shoot myself when I hear any mention of a sequel.

I couldn't believe what I was seeing and got hooked instantly. The plot may be as bad as a JS's show (ie there is no plot) but the acting is wicked, it's hilarious and it's all in all an incredible trash movie. It says as much about America than a Bully or a Ken Park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the US society, and more precisely on what afternoon TV viewers in America (and I believe there are plenty of them !) are interested in.

I didn't think the movie was very good, and the plot seemed like it was written by 5 year olds with very dirty minds. So the movie starts with this white trailer trash family who lives in South Florida, Jaime Pressly works at a hotel but she's a nymphomaniac, the first guy she runs into when she's house keeping, sleeps with him. Then she goes onto sleep with her stepfather, and he gets her pregnant, then here mother gets back at Pressly by sleeping with Pressly's fiancé.In this movie, Jerry Springer doesn't have a last name, he's just Jerry around his fans he seems like a good guy but behind their back he really doesn't like them (the movie lets you in on that) So Jaime Pressly (her movie name is Angel Zorzak) and her step dad and fiancé fly to LA to be on Jerrys show. She runs into a group of people who are supposed to be on the day after them, and sleeps with this other guy and her fiancé catches her. Her mother tries to do the same but fails, he and Connie just hang out. The only part I thought was funny was when one of Jerrys staff members sleeps with the transvestite.

It's in no way Oscar material of course, but it is not horrible.  It's the type of stupid comedy that makes you roll your eyes and laugh at the same time.  I'm a huge fan of the Scary Movie series, although I and no doubt everyone else who has seen those movies will agree they are inherently stupid.  This movie is pretty much the same thing, except based on the Jerry Springer show.  What separates this movie from the show is the behind-the-scenes look at a group of people slated to appear on the show, including white trash duo and mother and daughter Connie (Molly Hagan) and Angel (Jaime Pressly), Detroit sistas Starletta (Wendy Robinson), Vonda (Tangie Ambrose) and Leshawnette (Nicki Micheaux) and Startletta's unfaithful boyfriend Demond (Michael Jai White). Several points in the movie make (or attempt to make) you feel pity for these characters, but not in the way it was intended, I don't think. Towards the end of the movie, Jerry has this big long monologue about how people eat up the troubles of celebrities but when it comes to poor people, they can't digest it as well.  I was more compelled to feel sorry for these characters for their great unwashed status rather than the problems they faced themselves.  So, overall, I thought the movie was quite entertaining (although stupid), but fans of the actual show (which I am not) might not find it as satisfying, because the movie contains several moments that are serious and try to teach a deeper lesson that may seem out of place with the usual hijinks.

It's pretty bad. I will admit that. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would recommend skipping Ringmaster. Just watch the Jerry Springer Show.

The main guests are a mother (Molly Hagan) who learns that her daughter (Jaime Pressley) is sleeping with her husband (daughter's stepdad). I'm sure there are many people who hate the original Springer show so they'd actually sit through this movie just so they could tell everyone how bad it was. That's not me because I'll admit that I used to get a kick out of watching the show when I was a teenager but having not seen an episode in ages and then revisited it via this movie, I do wonder what I was thinking. However, I'm really not going to hold this movie against the show but I think it proves that the trash on it can be tolerated in 10-minute segments but whenever you try to stretch those stories into a full feature the results can be disastrous. What really killed this movie isn't that it's trash but it's the fact that nothing fun ever happens. The entire group of characters are just boring stereotypes who do just about everything you'd expect them to do. The white trash come to L.A. to get on the show and then the mom and daughter start trying to sleep with a black man from Detroit who is on the show because he cheated on his girlfriend. His other girlfriend and lover then get mad at the white girls and so goes even more fighting. I will admit that a couple of the one-liners are good but as a whole this is just a really poor movie. The performances by Pressly and Hagan are actually good and they do bring some life to the characters but there's simply nothing there. RINGMASTER is a perfect example of a major screw-up.
