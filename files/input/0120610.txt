I borrowed this tape with low expectations but was happily surprised by how entertaining it was.  What has happened to Patrick Swayze?  I thought he did a good job acting in both Donnie Darko and now this.  THIS film is what goofy, illogical action flicks are supposed to be.  This isn't simply a music video stretched out to an hour-and-a-half.  This director actually knows how to make a movie.  The plot ain't deep but there IS a plot, which is important.  The ideas are dopey but the actors aren't simply laughing their way through but rather they treated this like a serious work.  The actress who plays Swayze's wife has a style which usually annoys me but she, too, was ok in this thing.  Even the little bits of country music didn't bother me.  A stupid finale?  Sure, but even that was fun.  Wow.

Patrick Swayze has made some very good dramas (Ghost, City of Joy), and some very cheesy ones (To Wong Foo) and he knows the difference. Anyone who tries to take this movie seriously is missing the point. This one is a terrific guilty pleasure, with over-the-top performances by Swayze and his musician co-stars (Meat Loaf, Randy Travis), and some spectacular chase scenes complete with some truly cheesy touches (every automobile that crashes explodes, regardless of whether the gas tank is actually damaged or not).

In effort to make some much-needed money for his poor family, Crews bargains with a small arms dealer, played by Meat Loaf. Crews agrees to deliver the shipment for Meat Loaf in exchange for some cool cash. As you may have figured out by looking at the movie cover, Crews encounters hordes of inept henchmen along the way. Fortunately for Jack Crews, their vehicles explode easily. Still, Crews n' Company face many action-packed twist and turns on their journey. Swayze gives a spectacular performance; deserving of the either an academy award or employee of the month. I would recommend this film to anyone with eyes.

This has some 'skill' linked-up in the driving, I learned a couple cool things about Big Rigs, that I didn't realize before however, I haven't seen diesels doing stuff like that since, 'Breakdown' 'CONVOY' or 'Duel'. Patrick is pretty much always fun to see act in any movie that he is in, other than the banter back and forth from the Evil-Graeme Beckel's character, who had taken his wife (played by Brenda Strong, the woman walking down the street only in a 'bra' that caused 'Kramer' from Seinfeld to crash his car T.V.s Seinfeld) and daughter, then making it through that Hellish chase situation and accident, only to lose a new found friend 'Sonny' the F.B.I. man, suddenly being sideswiped by The heavier-weight-coupon clipping-Jimmy Swaggart-wannabe-evil boss Singer rock star/actor Meatloaf at the end of this flick, Jack (Swayze) can't get an even break.

But this movie is very good for what it is worth. First of all, I compare the storyline to Smokey and the Bandit....except minus the humor and lamentably the actors. The movie is about a ex-con trying to save his house by driving a truck full of illegal weapons across the eastern seaboard. You've got some great people in this movie +Patrick Swayze he looks like he could be a truck driver +Randy Travis who I admit I didn't recognize with the beard. I have no idea why he grew it +Possibly 50 Cent's brother. No doubt..when you see this man (who isn't related) you'll hear Wanksta begin playing +And the best Bloated Bible Thumping Meat Old Ass Bat Out Of Hell Loaf..who I cant believe actually CHOSE that name. This movie is not geared towards film buffs nor does it pretend to do so. This movie is for those who love the road and Cannonball Run (the first one only, jeez) or Smokey and The Bandit(Numbers 1 and 3..Dom Deluise and that retarded elephant killed number 2) The rest of the characters are a joke (especially the FBI agents...ever seen Pardon The Interruption?) but this movie is nothing more than an exciting and hard to stop watching road classic. Plus I live near where they drive the truck through (how about some love for South Carolina and N. Carolina looks amazing in the movie) So In conclusion, don't put down your Dead Poets Society or your Good Will Hunting for this, but sit back with a beer and enjoy this modern classic.

Jack isn't keen on the idea since he has no license & wants to stay out of trouble for his families sake, at home that night Jack finds a foreclosure letter hidden by his wife from the bank who are going to repossess his families house. Amazingly they owe the bank $9,000 so that $10,000 he was offered just hours before suddenly looks very tempting. Jack accepts the job but soon finds himself hauling a lorry of guns which are being tracked by the FBI & local redneck scumbag Red (Meat Loaf) wants to hijack the truck & steal them for himself, I guess Jack is just having one of those days...Directed Kevin Hooks Black Dog is a cheesy but sort of fun action flick that could have been better but also could have been worse. The somewhat predictable script by William Mickelberry & Dan Vining doesn't take itself too seriously & feels like an extended version of the final climatic truck chase from Mad Max 2 (1981) in the sense Jack has to protect his truck from all sorts of marauding bad guy's, obviously Swayze is no Mel Gibson & the two don't compare in terms of excitement or quality but that's what I kept think while I was watching it. The character's are clich√©d & one dimensional but they serve their purpose well enough, there's some alright one-liners including a funny one where a bad guy ends up splattered on the road & Swayze says 'Eeww, roadkill'! That line alone is almost worth watching this for. It certainly moves along at a brisk enough pace, you've got your bad guy's & you've got your good guy's as well as those caught up in the middle & you know what I actually thought Black Dog was pretty fun, it's not art but it's entertaining & how can you not like a film in which the main villain is Meat Loaf & the main hero is Patrick Swayze? You can't & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Hooks does alright, some of the truck crashes are impressive although the actual chase scenes lack a little spark, they are OK but not quite as exciting as I'd have liked. There's not much violence apart from a few shoot-outs & a fight at the end. Talking of the end even though Swayze has been hauling a lorry of guns & making lots of things blow up the FBI give him back his license, they let him go scott free, they take care of his $9,000 debt & let him drive the truck to the police pound. Isn't that a bit, well, generous? I mean he beat Cutler up didn't he? That in itself is assault & it doesn't matter if the guy he beat up is a scumbag either, also what about all the destruction he caused? Surely he broke the terms of his parole somewhere along the way, didn't he?Technically the film is fine, it looks like it had some money spent on it although it doesn't quite look like a mega budget affair. The acting is OK, Swayze looks bored & embarrassed, Meat Loaf is Meat Loaf while Charles S. Dutton puts in a funny performance as FBI agent Alan Ford (Ford? Trucks? Is that meant to be an in-joke because I ain't laughing guy's!).Black Dog is a silly, cheesy & amusing way to pass 90 odd minutes, it's a light hearted action flick using big trucks. It's watchable enough for sure.

It's definitely no worse or better than any other similar simple straight-forward action flick from the '90's.Of course the movie is suffering from more than 1 problem though. One obviously is its story. It's simple and actually doesn't make a lot of sense and is a real unlikely one. I mean, why did Red ever let the truck drive off from his place, only to dangerously attempt to hijack it later, on the very same day. But oh well, without this story we wouldn't had all those exploding trucks and action scenes within this movie.Well, it's not like the action is much spectacular though. Funny enough there are lots of exploding trucks and cars but they already seem to blow up when one of the passengers farts. Action-wise this movie just isn't good or spectacular enough to watch.Another problem with the movie is that it has far too many villains in it. It's like the main characters against the rest of the world. The movie also doesn't seem to be able to make a choice who to make the main and most important villain of the movie, with as a result that all of the villainous characters aren't really anything memorable or evil enough, since the movie spends to much time on showing the many different villainous characters of the movie.The movie is from the period when Patrick Swayze's career of course already was more or less on a death end. Nevertheless he's always good and serious with every role that he plays. He's also credible in this role, despite his already showing age. He was perhaps a tad bit too old at the time of this movie to play the main lead in an action movie. Meat Loaf mostly seemed to have had fun with playing his role, which shows on the screen. But like I said before, since he plays a villain, he didn't get the screen time he deserved. There are parts in the movie were he completely disappears, only to show up 20 minutes later again.But despite this all, the movie is good and entertaining enough to watch. It's current rating on here would suggest that this is one of the worst action flicks of the '90's but it hardly is. It's also no better than some action flicks but also definitely no worse than some others.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Very unrealistic, but action-packed","Date":"21 October 1998","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I really enjoyed this movie. I do prefer intelligent thrillers, but I don't mind unrealistic stuff if it's good. It was surprising to see Patrick Swayze was in this movie, seeing that it's so unrealistic and it's what would seem like a fool's errand in the eyes of the critics, but I credit his performance. It is about a truckie who is driving a truck filled with firearms, while guys come along, try to kill them, and get the guns. Meat Loaf's acting performance wasn't great, he should have just made a contribution to the soundtrack, and I thought he was over-the-top at the end, racing a truck, wildly raving and chanting bible verses. But the action scenes are good, despite the unrealism. Explosions happen when they wouldn't normally, and shooting people doesn't seem to do anything but make them wince. At one stage, Patrick Swayze is beating a guy up on the truck, and Meat Loaf comes along in his ute-type vehicle, and shoots him in his arm. He winces, but he keeps punching with the same vengeance and strength as before. Despite lack of credibility, it was an exciting adventure and was a film about truck-driving, which I have never actually seen in a movie before. Overall, it was great and the chase scenes are very well-done sometimes. If you aren't expecting too much and don't mind unrealistic things, and you like action movies, see this.

BLACK DOG is a fairly standard late-90's B-grade action movie, but its colorful characters help it to transcend the genre clich√©s and make it somewhat memorable. The basic plot is that Jack Crews (Patrick Swayze) is in need of some extra money and agrees to take a truck-driving job transporting some goods. Little does he know that it's some illegal guns, and soon he has people on his trail as he tries to make the delivery.I've never been too much of a Patrick Swayze fan, mostly because I don't think he can act that well. He has some charisma, for sure, but the only movie I've really enjoyed him in prior to this was ROAD HOUSE. Here, he doesn't get that kind of a role to play, but thankfully the supporting players pick up the slack and make the movie worth watching. Of those cast members, the most entertaining were Meat Loaf as a Bible-quoting madman, and Charles Dutton and Stephen Tobolowsky as a bickering FBI and ATF agent, respectively. Their short scene that opens the film is, in my opinion, the best part and sort of sets the tone for what follows, at least when they're on screen. Randy Travis also has a supporting role, but all they can do with him is make jokes and references to his real-life career as a country singer.In general, the acting was decent for this type of movie. The action, of course, was well-done. By virtue of being produced before Hollywood became obsessed with CGI and shaky-cam, this film features real stunts, real explosions and crisp, clean action sequences done with some flair. Yes, having cars and trucks explode on impact in a collision is ridiculous, but it's also ridiculously entertaining to watch. Most importantly, the truck-driving sequences were filmed in an interesting way, and actually on the highway. Other positives I can think of are a suitably bombastic score and some gentle soundtrack cuts courtesy of Randy Travis. I don't really care for country music, but he's one person I can tolerate.The negative aspects I can mention are all fairly standard for the genre. There's a lot of plot holes, story threads that aren't followed up on (or at least satisfactorily), and of course the premise. Part of this can be chalked up to the run time. At 89 minutes, it is a little light on story and character development, but then again it didn't exactly need to be complex. Overall, this was much more fun than I was anticipating. It's by no means a good movie, but it's pretty entertaining for what it is. When all is said and done, there's a lot worse ways to spend your time. Also, they do explain what the title means, in case you were wondering.

Despite having lost his licence he takes the job for the money.  However once he starts his trip with an escort he finds that the original holder of the guns is trying to not only get paid for the weapons but also steal the load back.  Crews finds himself trying to avoid police and criminals alike to get the job done.Who said they don't make Smokey and the Bandit movies anymore?!  This mixes both elements of those movies with modern thriller strands.  The plot is therefore pretty mixed.  It starts out ignoring the fact that Crews is carrying illegal weapons and ignores the moral issues this may throw up regarding the film painting him as a good man, it then focuses on big truck action with plenty of cars, trucks, jeeps blowing up and skidding all round the place.  The second half keeps some of this action but it realises that it needs to end with Crews being a good guy and suddenly the guns issue is brought up and it looks for a happy thriller style end.  The plot is quite unlikely - Why did Red suddenly seem happy to steal this load - he'd never done it before, and the twists aren't exactly a surprise.  The action is distracting for the most part - but overblown spectacle doesn't replace genuine excitement, and, as Burt Reynolds discovered, how many times can you watch a truck crash before it gets old.The performances are not great.  Swayze is poor and just has a pained expression on his face throughout.  Meat Loaf is a not so much a meatloaf as he is a huge glazed ham - he overacts and looks bugeyed like he was in one of his videos.  Charles Dutton and Stephen Tobolowsky aren't great but their odd-couple interplay at least makes them interesting.  The rest of the cast are familiar faces (Randy Travis, Gabriel Casseus etc) but don't really have very much to do.Overall it's quite enjoyable because the action scenes are quite good.  The story is daft and the actors don't have much to do but the sheer spectacle of it covers the whole for most of the film.  Almost.  The final five minutes is dumb and typical of the film's sense of spectacle over substance.

His crooked boss, Cutler (Graham Beckel), offers Jack a sizable sum to transport some goods, despite the fact that Jack has no licence and legally is not allowed to drive. Desperate for the cash, Jack takes the job, but soon finds out that he's running guns. Together with sidekicks like aspiring country songwriter Earl (real life country star Randy Travis), he must avoid goons like the relentless Red (singer Meat Loaf), who tries to hijack the weapons for himself.Black Dog is just the kind of thing you watch when you don't want to have to think too much. The script is very unimaginative, but then the story is merely a set up for a non-stop array of extremely impressive vehicular stunts, which all seem to be done the old fashioned, practical way. As a no-brainer action movie, Black Dog *does* do its job well enough. It also helps that some of the characters are genuinely engaging. Cutler and Red are very much stock villains; it comes as no surprise when Cutler barges in on Jacks' wife (Brenda Strong) and daughter (Erin Broderick) and threatens them in order to manipulate Jack. The comedy relief doesn't particularly work, coming from characters such as Wes (Brian Vincent) and ATF Agent McClaren (Stephen Tobolowsky); McClaren has a predictably antagonistic relationship with Ford (Charles Dutton), a hot tempered FBI agent on the case.The supporting cast is fairly solid. Travis is pretty darn amusing, as is Meat Loaf, although the latters' dialogue gets to be annoying towards the end. The late Swayze never was an especially dynamic actor, but he creates a reasonably sympathetic and reasonably bad ass hero.For what this is, it's enjoyable.

We get great performances from Patrick Swayze, Randy Travis, Meatloaf, Gabriel Casseus and Graham Beckel. Also of-mention is Crews' daughter, played by 11-year-old Erin Broderick. She just had a special something and lit up every scene with her in it.Swayze plays the part to a T of a basically-decent person, just-released from a 2-year prison stint, and is obviously traumatized by both the incarceration and the knowledge that his negligence killed someone. I think his was a socially-important part, because herein, we see the effect of over-working, as one tries to create a decent life for one's family.Randy Travis plays his part well, never over-acting, and always imbuing his words and actions with the sense of calm and humor he is known for in music circles. I enjoyed him in 1997's Fire Down Below, and in The Black Dog, he gets a much more substantial role, and much more screen time. His references to song writing and singing were humorous.Meatloaf is the surprise of the movie. His role as religion-crazed black marketeer plays excellent counter-point to the other, more-reserved characters in the movie. It was great to see Gabriel Casseus (as undercover F.B.I agent). I admired his work in 2000's Bedazzled and would like to see more of his work. I was not familiar with Graham Beckel, who plays the arms-dealing mastermind in The Black Dog, but whoever did casting for the movie knew a good bad guy when they saw one. Not being a trucker, I'm not sure if some of the driving stunts Crews pulled off are possible.., or not, but the scene with him getting out of the cab and swinging outside the cab over to the fifth wheel to fight a bad guy is definitely something to see. It was definitely Swayze.., not a stunt double.I have never understood how a moving vehicle can hit a stationary object (like a mobile home) and then fly over it, spinning, but the good news is that I don't have to. The Black Dog is a good action movie with a special cast and a couple of important social messages 1.) Don't fore-close on people's house (and family), because they will do whatever it takes to keep their life. and 2.) Do not demand inhumane hours and effort from your employees, because they could pop.

The is an unexceptional action film, the norm, with really a simple scenario, we rely on car crashes, explosions to keep it going, which helps break the tedium of the actor's talk in between, with not the best written characters either, all though I did like the rambling Randy Travis, as the budding song writer. In Black Dog, age has worn and wearied Swayze, who plays a ex con, who did time on account of vehicular manslaughter, where his trucking days are now over. Now with his dream house in foreclosure, as he's just found out, he's trucking days have returned, when he's forced to take a 15 hour truck route offer at his work, he originally turned down, threats and all, to make the cash. This turns out to be a big mistake, as this truck, unbeknown to him, is hauling a lot of gun armor, where Meatloaf, and it's great to see him really seeing red, is ripping off the weaponry, but of course Swayze overpowers him, where now he's in over his head as breaking parole, where it just takes a call, but also his wife and cute little daughter, become hostages. There are a couple of suspense bits, one at a way station, where really they aren't impressive, but this is a standard action if bordering on commonplace movie, with some situations and very few plot points. We have two bickering cops to fill in the rest of the movie. One ATF, the other's FBI, one has a angry temperament, the other much more passive, it's a highpoint of this time passer. Oh they're the best performances in the movie, although Swayze's blonde and beautiful wife in this was good too. Even when we find out one of the trucking crew was FBI, we're not really even surprised, or don't care, which as I said before, they're the most memorably written characters. I admit, some of the action sequences were thrilling and well choreographed, but this is what this movie needed if to survive. It's mostly flat. Meatloaf, like only a couple of other actors turned in good or semi good performances. I did like the shock moment in the second ending with Meatloaf. Sadly Black dog just earns it place in the cheap, average, if B grade standard. One could say it was painfully average. The title actually refers to fatigued and worn truckers who a black dog leaping before them which instinctively has them realizing, when veered over, they're about to hit another vehicle. I'd like to hear other truckers opinions on that.

It doesn't rank as high as Joy Ride or Maximum Overdrive did with me, but it proves itself worthy of recognition. It has a capable cast, a thin, yet efficient premise, but a modest level of suspense.Our main character is Jack Crews (Swayze), a man recently released from prison for vehicular manslaughter who agrees to take a job delivering toilets from Atlanta to New Jersey for $10,000. His no longer has a license, but takes the job out of desperation to prevent his house from getting repossessed. When he goes to pick up a truck to deliver the toilets, he meets Red (Loaf) a suspicious, and utterly unsettling Jesus freak who winds up being more than meets the eye.Crews' partners on the delivery are Earl (Travis), Sonny (Cassesus), and Wes (Vincent). It isn't long before the four men discover they are being hunted by Red's men who want to turn this into a deadly cat and mouse game.The film is low on substance, but manages to make up for the film in terms of action scenes. Some are coherently shown, and sometimes, others serve as just set pieces. The film lacks the suspense of films like Joy Ride and Speed, although it does bring a considerable amount of talent to the table. Black Dog isn't bad, but it's thin and ordinary. It lacks in the field of suspense, which is something that is almost required in the high speed trucker genre.Starring Patrick Swayze, Randy Travis, Meat Loaf, Graham Beckel, Brenda Strong, Charles S. Dutton, Lorraine Toussaint, and Stephen Tobolowsky. Directed by Kevin Hooks.

They don't, though they do mention it. Maybe they just couldn't get the rights to the song. That doesn't matter because it is a pretty decent film anyway and they don't need one Led Zepplin song to make it any better.The movie is based around a truck driver that has had his license suspended for life for culpable driving (vehicular manslaughter in the US). He has just been released and is given a job repairing trucks. His boss is a crook though and wants him to run a shipment of guns from Atlanta to New Jersey, something which he does not want to do. When he discovers that his house is about to be repossessed by the bank, he changes his mind and takes the job.The movie thus becomes a road movie in a very big truck. But there are numerous other aspects, like the theme of appearance and reality and trust. There are numerous people in the movie that have many different motives and we are never sure who is on the truckies side. The only people we know are who they claim to be are the driver and his family. Everybody else seem to have other things on their mind, and even more, they may seem bad and turn out to be good.One may be interested in why the movie is called Black Dog. Decent name, but there is a reason behind it. It seems at first that it may have something to do with the black pitbull in the back of the truck, but this is not the case. It is actually a truckie legend, that before the truckie falls, they will see the black dog. It is a harbinger of doom and a humbler of proud souls. The black dog is only added as character background and there is never any appearance of it during the journey.Black Dog is an action movie with big trucks. If you like trucks, then Black Dog is a good movie. If you like seeing trucks get smashed up and destroyed, then you will seriously like Black Dog. It has a simple plot with a fair bit of action. There is time where is focuses on character development, but it is seeing the truck scenes that captures your minds with this movie rather than the interaction.

Directed by Kevin Hooks (Passenger 57), and starring MeatLoaf, and Patrick Swayze.A Truck Driver who is the major bread winner for his family was trying to provide just that little bit more by taking on extra work.  Extra work means extra hours, and less sleep.  For Jack Cruise that spelled disaster when he fell asleep at the wheel of his truck.  As a result of his truck going out of control, he killed a motorist, had his CDL revoked, and was sent to jail for 3 years.  After getting out of jail, he finds out just how hard things have been for his wife and daughter.  Their house is about to be repossessed since little payment has been made on it, and the mountain load of other bills that didn't stop while Cruise was in jail. Cruise is offered a driving job that pays a lot of cash.  It would be enough to pay off his overdue debt.  But what to do?  He doesn't have a license, so he could go back to jail if he is caught.......just one shipment, the cops won't be anywhere around right? It is obvious from the beginning that this is no ordinary load, as a chaperone is sent along with the truck, and all kinds of strange things are happening along the way. While not as far fetched as the Simpson's episode where Homer drives a rig a finds out about the box that takes over control of the Truck, if you think about anything, it can seem rather far fetched.

I was shocked at the gritty realism that Randy Travis and Meatloaf brought to this movie.  I found Meatloaf's acting job breath taking,  he was a bad dude but he kept quoting bible verses, so one was inclined to think that maybe he isn't that bad.  But don't be fooled, he was one bad man.  I only wish they focused more on his character.  He was like Darth Maul in Star Wars where you knew he was a bad guy, but you really were hopping he would tear more things up.  I also like Randy Travis he made feel like he had been traveling the road for many years and had been there, done that.  I look forward many more wonderful performances by him in the up coming future. Patrick Swayze also did a great job.  He had the presence of a man who has spent some time in jail.  You could see it in his face, he knew when to fight and when to run.  He also did a great job in the exciting driving sequences.  Who knew driving semi's is such an art?

I have seen millions of variations of movies with numerous car chases, crash scenes, villians who, for some pointless reason, are all religious, ex-cons just trying to make it good, people who you can't trust, etc. All of this and not much more are in Black Dog. The movie stars Patrick Swayze as the ex-con(who was convicted of something that really wasn't his fault), who, since his release, has gone on to maintain a fairly successful life in New Jersey with his wife and their teenage daughter. Unfortunately, the husband and wife are short of money, and the only way they can keep their house is if Patrick goes to work. Luckily, he has found a job driving trucks in Georgia. This is pretty much where the movie begins to get confusing, as he unknowingly becomes a part of some gun-smuggling ring, is pursued by a bunch of cars that are much smaller than his truck(nevertheless, they like to bump into it and bug him), and basically, he and his fellow drivers become on the run from some bad guy. Of course, his fellow drivers aren't so good themselves, and now he can trust nobody. To top everything off, the FBI somehow gets on his tail, and they begin to target his wife and daughter at home, which bugs him even more. What's a guy to do? Well, like most B-movie heroes, Patrick keeps a clear head. Of course he is a good fighter and a quick thinker, and this proves him well. There are numerous deaths and car crashes that don't add to the drama, and everybody's personalities get worse and worse, until there are only a couple of good guys left. But we don't really get to know much about how good they are. Black Dog relies so heavily on action and car chases that it tends to forget that there are people that drive these cars. Well, even the worst of movies usually have some bright spots, and Black Dog has a few, such as a rather good performance by the lad who played Sonny. Patrick Swayze is alright as the action hero, and he even has a couple of good scenes when he is talking with Sonny and one with Randy Travis. Nevertheless, it's really not much of a movie.I expect to see it air in the late night showings of HBO, but I am not sure if I would want to watch it again.

Where do I start with this one?","Date":"11 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  First off, it is very easy for one to hate this movie.  Not because Swayze does a bad job (he does what he can with the shoddy writing and he looks deeply embarassed, even during the action scenes), not because it is funny in ALL the wrong places, but because the writers just seem to be half-assing it.  Let's hope that's what they're doing, because if they actually TRIED on this script, then I'm moving out West and becoming a screenwriter.  To try and figure out the plot, would cause permanant damage to one's mind.  I'm serious.  The dialogue that we're given makes Showgirls sound like it was written by Tarantino, and the humor (when it's intentional) is almost as insulting.There are many, MANY things wrong with this movie.  I mentioned the plot earlier, so lets back it up a second and talk about that.  Okay, things start off semi-promisingly (I'm talking about the opening credit sequence) with some rockin' fiddle music and a decent car chase.  We meet our hero, do-gooder, all-around goody-two-shoe, Jack Crews (original huh?) and we soon learn that he's a recently paroled convict who mowed down a family in his big-rig after falling asleep at the wheel.  He's currently grunting it out as a mechanic while barely making ends meet at home.  Unbeknownst to him, his wife almost lost it all while he was in the clinker and they're about to lose the  house.   This means that they'll have to go back to Newark and live in an apartment while his daughter will have to go back to a school with metal-detectors in the halls!! (I'm not making this up).  So, when Jack is hit up by his boss, to drive a load for ten-thousand dollars, he reluctantly accepts. There ya have it.  Our hero gets duped into running a load of illegal weapons.  Now, here's what boggles my mind  Okay, Red (played to over-the-top perfection by Meatloaf) is the guy who gives Jack the load and the rig.  Later on, he's trying his best to hi-jack the load(!)  Now, if he already had the guns in his possession, why is going tooth and nail, trying to get them back? WHAT THE HELL???  I don't get it.   Oh, and get this, if Jack didn't already have enough to worry about, his wife and daughter get kidnapped and he's got the ATF on his case for good measure.  He's also got Randy Travis in the rig with him to belt out some of the most god-awful country lyrics you've ever heard in your life (I think that was intentional humor).  Anyway, in a movie like this, you can almost always bank on there being a happy, sappy ending and you need not worry because everything is going to be A-Okay.  Now, on the upside, the action scenes are pretty decent and I was glad to see Patrick Swayze again after his accident.  The movie, as preposterous as it may be, does keep our attention and I doubt that anyone will get bored.  It was also kind of nice to see a throw-back to the days of Convoy and Smokey and the Bandit.  If you enjoyed either of these, you may want to check out Black Dog.  Just don't strain your brain trying to figure out the mess of a plot.

He's one of my all time favorite singers, and I've (gulp) watched just about every piece of acting he's done so far.  I will say that in each film I've seen him in he gets a little better, and he managed to pull off several comedic scenes very believably in this movie.

The average person might remember Dirty Dancing and/or Ghost, but everything else he has done has a way of being forgotten. So imagine the surprise when he pops back into view in a theater bound popcorn flick that while it won't make heads turn does mildly entertain.Black Dog is another action road movie complete with chases. The hook is of course now it's with really big trucks. You could say it's all rather recycled and fairly predictable, but like most action pixs, the story is not what you tune in for anyhow. Swayze is a man trying to put his life and the life of his family back on track after a stint in prison. All he has to do is carry out this last job ... the last big score and we all know how well those go. Like I said, recycled, but Swayze works and the unique cast of faces including Meat Loaf and Randy Travis kicking up the supporting cast help somewhat. The director Kevin Hooks also notably helmed Passenger 57 starring Wesley Snipes some time ago. So he's moved on from airplanes to big rigs. One can only guess where you go from here as a director. Black Dog pulls no surprises, but it's not an eyesore either. Think Point Break. Just sit back, turn off the brain and enjoy.

While this film won't win any awards for originality it is still a reasonably enjoyable big dumb action flick, with plenty of stunts and thrills crammed into it's (thankfully) short running time.Performance wise Patrick Swayze has his good 'ole boy act down to an art by now and slips into it once again easily here, and it serves him well, while Randy Travis and Gabriel Casseus are both quite enjoyable as two of his travelling companions. However the rest of the performances for the most part range from acceptable to overplayed, with Meat Loaf completely over the top (in a bad, not fun way) as the bible quoting bad guy, and Stephen Tobolowsky and Charles S. Dutton somewhat irritating as the two cops on the case.Helmer Kevin Hooks' direction here is pretty well handled but somewhat lacking in terms of spark or impact, while the script is pretty much paper thin in terms of any real plot development even for an action film.So it's a bad film then? Well no, not exactly. Somehow despite it's obvious flaws Black Dog still manages to be a short, fun, pacey ride that works more often than not while never pretending to be anything more that what it is, and manages to be quite watchable because of it (especially for the action junkies). For those simply seeking a solidly entertaining, if undemanding action flick then you could do much worse than check this one out.One man's opinion. 7/10 "},{"Title":"The only way to stay safe is to avoid this film","Date":"6 November 1998","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  This is quite the worst excuse for a film I have seen for some time.

Smart people call it drunk driving and accept responsibility as oppose to blaming it all on man's best friend. It bares little to the plot but that is Patrick Swayze's excuse when he swerves and kills two people resulting in a two year prison stay. Patrick Swayze reluctantly accepts a job of illegal transporting of weapons. He cannot trust his companions, bullets are flying, and trucks flip over and explode. And if that isn't enough, he will be met with the reality that this film sucks. Director Kevin Hooks handles the action well but the screen writing is a problem all its own. Swayze is cardboard while Randy Travis plays an embarrassing country singing trucker. Meatloaf plays a villain that is about as threatening as Ronald McDonald. He shouts threats over the phone that are unfortunately not aimed at whoever talked him into signing on to this film to begin with. Brenda Strong plays Swayze's wife who likely suspects his bullshit and just plays good wife because that is all the screenplay can summon her to do.

For that to happen they would have had to be coming out of NYC. Last but not least when the exchange is being made and Travis is up in the crane the load is no longer in the over the road trailer and in a shipping container.

He accepts the job against his wife's disapproval. On the way, he's being attacked from people who try to keep him from doing that job.To me, this movie is too shallow on the right things and too thorough in the wrong ones.First of all, here's a man who, supposedly, has been living for 2 years with guilt for having killed a whole family on the side of the road while he was falling asleep driving, and he's smiling almost every time his pursuers go up in flames. Now, I'd love to see what he'll be telling his kid about that. It would have been good to see Swayze showing some doubts upon whether he's doing the right, but no, the man just keeps going, knowing he could go to prison, risk his family's life, and make them lose their house anyway. Second of all, his load is being attacked by successively, cars, trucks and motorbikes all shooting at it and not one is thinking about aiming for the tires...
