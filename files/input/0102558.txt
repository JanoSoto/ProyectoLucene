This one makes them look like Peewee's Playhouse.You know how certain horror movies cross over into comedy? Like when Freddy Krueger says Welcome to prime time b!tch!! and slams a girl's head into the TV? Well, this is the opposite comedy crossing over into horror. It gets pretty weird, and if you're not expecting it, it can be downright upsetting.I think that's what makes so many people hate this movie. With an all-star comedic cast like it has, it promises to be a laugh riot like the DVD cover says. I was expecting something like Ghostbusters meets Fletch meets Summer Rental. Instead it's more like Planes, Trains & Automobiles meets Deliverance. In other words the comedy is very low-key, not quite enough to offset the disturbing story.Dan Akroyd, who plays a sadistic murdering judge, is just plain frightening. John Candy, who plays the sympathetic policeman, gives the story an air of tragedy. Chevy Chase is his usual wisecracking self, but it can't compete with the horror & violence of the plot (being trapped in a hicktown house while people are getting brutally murdered all around you). You really have to be ready for it, otherwise you might end up traumatized. The Bonestripper scene will give lifelong nightmares to any kid under the age of 12, as well as impressionable adults.But now that you've been warned, perhaps you'll be able to take it in stride. I'm not sure if writer Dan Akroyd intended this to be so nightmarish, but it sure is. Definitely a one-of-a-kind. NOT for young kids!!

Chevy Chase is really funny with his sort of smart-ass, dry wit, probably his best performance after Christmas Vacation. From the movies I've seen Demi Moore in, this ranks as her best and shows that she can do comedy. Dan Akroyd and John Candy each pull double duty in this one and do it well- I couldn't even tell the second character Dan was playing until the credits rolled. The sets are unreal- from the junkyard (complete with piles and PILES of random junk and the Baby Huey-esquire Lil' Debil and Bobo) to the house of the honorable judge, it's hard to believe they actually put this together.

I think the main reason is that with a cast of such comedy legends as Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and John Candy, people were expecting a more conventional comedy. Most of their audience was probably expecting something along of the lines of The Couch Trip, Delirious or Fletch. I think people like me, who appreciate campy horror films like 2001 Maniacs, The Butcher and any of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, are more likely to find some humor in this film.Thanks to the remarkably bland title, I had no idea that this was a comedy with a horror twist when I found it on a cable channel. The completely pointless start of the film, which involves a party and some sort of talk of some sort of business deal, also doesn't hint at what the film is really about. It isn't until the protagonists get arrested that all of the fun starts.What follows is something in between comedy and horror. It skews more towards horror, with tons of gross-out scenes thanks to Dan Aykroyd's various grotesque characters. There are tons of bones, but not a lot of blood. Unlike conventional horror movies, where body-counts are generally in the double digits, only one group of ne'er-do-wells end up slaughtered over the course of the film. Even the two annoying ancillary characters who are along for the ride, who would be dead meat in any real horror film, end up getting a reprieve and a happy ending.By far the strangest part, and my personal favorite, is the musical performance in the middle of the film. When I saw a limo pulling up in a scene halfway through the film, I thought, okay here come some more victims. I was surprised to say the least that the occupants of the vehicle turned out to be the entire Digital Underground crew, including the instantly recognizable Shock G (aka Humpty Hump)! Instead of being murdered, they all perform a song (unfortunately not their one major hit, the far superior Humpty Hump). You can even see the late-great Tupac Shakur as one of the members of Digital Underground, before he started his solo career. I would recommend this film to anyone just for this surreal moment, but if you have no idea who Tupac or Digital Underground are then you probably won't enjoy it as much.After a few fake endings and the actual goofy cartoon ending, the movie is over. All in all, it doesn't have that many laughs, and it's definitely not scary, but it is rarely boring. The Digital Underground cameo is excellent and the cast plays their roles well. This is certainly not the best movie I've seen, but I would rank it better than any bad comedy and most bad horror movies. In fact, I'd say this film is just a few buckets of blood and a few crazy gross-out scenes away from a cult classic.

This movie is called, Nothing But Trouble, and its buried in cinematic obscurity, but for all the right reasons. Whats even more insulting is the fact that Dan Aykroyd actually wrote and directed this picture, as if this was the movie he was dreaming to get made. He must have been on some strong dope. Here, he plays a deteriorating old man with a penis shaped nose who stands as the justice of the peace of a rural northeastern town. Among his family is a duo of mentally challenged mutant toad- humanoids and John Candy in drag. Not to mention, the whole area surrounding them is a toxic waste dump complete with dead corpses.

The paper the script was written on would have served a more useful purpose in wrapping fish--which may well be exactly what happened, because my God does this thing stink. The whole movie is one long Rube Goldberg contraption, except that, unlike Goldberg's gizmos, this isn't amusing, funny, clever, or anything else other than painful. I've often wondered after seeing a particularly headache-inducing piece of cinematic bilge if the people who made it had any idea of how bad it was going to be when they were shooting it. After seeing this, I can't believe that anyone who participated in this atrocity didn't know how bad it was going to be BEFORE they shot it. Maybe they figured, Hey, it's Dan Aykroyd, he'll think up something funny. That's like being told you need brain surgery and that your surgeons are going to be Johnny Knoxville and Tom Green, and figuring, Well, that's OK, they'll learn brain surgery before the operation.The only even remotely amusing bits in this movie belong to John Candy as both a cop and his sister (!), and that's due solely to Candy's ability to make a silk purse out of a sow's droppings.

Ironically, the film was written by an arguably intelligent team (the brothers Aykroyd) and starred four usually reliable actors  Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Demi Moore, and the late John Candy.  How then could a production go so disastrously wrong?  You really have to see it to believe how bad it is.

Some really amazing sets here, pre-CGI. In my opinion this movie has only two weaknesses 1. It's a little slow getting started with a protracted dinner party prologue, and 2. The two giant mutant baby grandchildren that live out in the junkyard are just too cartoonish, and not funny at all. But the rest of the movie is great, well worth your while. I particularly enjoy anticipating what ruling the Reeve is going to hand out with each case, and the conclusion of the State Police raid is also a great moment!

First and most importantly I cannot understand why so many people think this movie is gross or has parts that are hard to stomach. MAN UP! The scene in Apollo 13 where the guy pukes in space is more grotesque than anything in Nothing But Trouble. In my opinion this movie is pleasantly bizarre and random. I loved the fact that it starts out like very much like any old movie (the only part that many of the film's most critical reviewers seem to like) and turns into something you would never expect at all. I know I was totally surprised when they end up in that mansion with that crazy old judge. Its like a crazy dream in a film. Set design was awesome.I think many people just don't understand the humor used the film. I've noticed that many people who have given the film negative reviews have stated the only funny part is when.... - and then each person lists a different scene, each equally amusing in my mind. At times the Shire Reeve is hilarious, saying the weirdest things. This is worse than a week of yellow s***storms. MA SKUNK! wheasey peasey *strange whistle sound* and his nose even turns into the tip of a penis during the hot dog train scene (if you happen to catch it as it is only for a brief second)It seems the more times I watch it the funner it gets. I think I like it so much for the same reason most people hate it so much. Because it is unorthodox and isn't just the same old run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. It stands alone in my mind as one of the most uniquely entertaining films of its time. I made all of my friends and every girlfriend I've ever had watch it and most seemed to like it.Don't get me wrong, I am taking it for what it is. It has its flaws. Chevy Chase did kind of sleepwalk throughout the whole film. Demi Moore looks terrible and plays a character that is unfunny and somewhat irritating at times. I think most people just expect way too much from this movie once they see who is in it. If at all possible the best viewing scenario for this movie would be to forget about WHO is in it and to try not to expect to see Uncle Buck, or Clark Griswald or a reenactment of the movie Ghost.

I love Dan Aykroyd. He was and still is one of my top ten favorite talents to emerge from Saturday Night Live. However, as far as being able to write, produce, direct and star in a film, he might have bit off more than he could handle. I saw a portion of this movie for the first time around 1995; it was the scene where Chevy Chase is tried before the judge, found guilty on trumped-up charges and sent through the roller coaster from hell to his death. That was it for me. I never knew what happened next for several years. What happened before that? Where did it go from there? I had to know. Some years passed, and I found the movie at the local library. (Yes, libraries actually rent movies, and they do it for free.) It turns out what I missed was Chevy Chase as a successful stock broker meeting Demi Moore, a really hot lawyer, and that's basically where things spring board. It starts out dull and boring and leaves you waiting to get into the plot. Chevy wants to take Demi out for a long drive down the coast to be alone, but in walks the late Taylor Negron from Fast Times At Ridgemont High and his girlfriend to horn in on the trip and pretty much get on everyone's last nerve, including the audience. They don't even have a purpose in this movie and are quickly shuffled out twenty minutes later after serving their purpose. After pressuring Chevy to break the law and get them all arrested, they all get dragged up before Dan Aykroyd in very heavy (and I do mean VERY HEAVY) prosthetics in a courthouse in the middle of several acres of junkyard surrounded by a moat. While this fat-suit gimmick worked out great for Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor, Aykroyd uses it to become as gross, obnoxious and unappealing as possible. It's just not funny or really integral to the plot. The house and junkyard with its various Addams Family hidden room aspects are more intriguing, but we never see much of it. John Candy plays the judge's nephew, the only normal person in the judge's family, but Candy also gets stuck playing double-duty as his overweight and homely sister in a role that is both disturbing and uncomfortable for Candy. It's supposedly played for laughs, but it's not funny. The rest of the movie is pretty much about Chevy and Demi trying to escape with Chevy getting trapped into a marriage with the homely fat niece and sent through the aforementioned roller coaster to his death. Luckily, it conks out before truly chewing him up. Unfortunately, he's basically sleepwalking through the scenes and phoning in his dialogue without the energy or personality of Clark Griswold. Demi Moore tries playing her role straight, but it is not hard to see she's completely confused and dismayed by the script that isn't very funny and is actually frequently disturbing. It's basically Deliverance as a live-action horror cartoon, and it's not really helped by a disconnected musical interlude by a group I'm told calls itself Digital Underground. I'm never heard of them either, but they're the only good thing in this movie even if it gets disturbing to watch two young beautiful ladies rub up against Aykroyd in his fat latex old man costume. If this movie is what we can expect from the unbridled imagination that is Dan Aykroyd, all I can say is Thank-God for Harold Ramis for keeping him restrained enough to create Ghostbusters.

The courthouse and the prison are a maze of booby- traps and deadly contraptions.

One liners are cringe-worthy, but coming from Chase, they sort of work, and Moore is just hilariously bad.Add Candy in drag, and a couple of what could only be described as blobs into the mix, and you have one of the most random movies to come out of the nineties.I like it, I can't think for the life of me why, but I always enjoy watching it.

Then again, when I consider some of the movies that have garnered best picture Academy Awards, the whole flawed process of rating movies becomes clear. There is simply no accounting for taste. For example, consider that, the overlong, pretentious, and painfully boring, Chariots of Fire, actually WON the Best Picture award, and yet all the film gave me (and MANY others) was a bad headache. To each his own.So, on to my review. I never saw this picture when it debut in 1991, but I clearly recall watching its HBO premiere. I found it to be one of the finest examples of really dark comedy that I had ever seen. The wonderful serendipitous circumstances which allowed Mr. Ackroyd to secure the services of top notch talent like Moore and Chase only served to make the movie seem all the more believable and satisfying. I'm sure that all of the headliner performers felt like their agents had consigned them to apply their considerable talents to, what can only be described as, the circle of hell that Dante might have envisioned for the bloated egos of self-aggrandizing film stars. The look on Chase's face when he imagines the judge's nose transformed into a penis is so authentic that I was convulsed with laughter. And who can forget that priceless card game between Demi Moore and the delightful Little Devil and BoBo. Surely Ms. Moore has experienced similar feelings while surrounded by adoring male fans queuing up to the very edge of Hollywood's famed red carpet.What makes this film even more of a gem is that we, as the audience, KNOW that this was probably not what the actors believed that they had signed up for. It plays as humorously as if, say, Lawrence Olivier had been contracted to star as Mr. Hand in Fast Times At Ridgemont High. To their credit, all of the actors are in fine form, and do deliver their very best to the insane plot and dialog. And that, in a nutshell, is why this film belongs on any film buff's must see list.

Dan Aykroyd is frickin hilarious as the J.P. and John Candy gives an equally amusing performance as Constable Dennis/Eldona. Chevy Chase and Demi Moore also give noteworthy performances, although their characters are less memorable. From the reviews I've read about this film, the general consensus appears to be negative. I'm a little confused. What exactly is so unsatisfying about the film? The script isn't that bad, and Dan Aykroyd does a decent job directing. There's even a cameo appearance by Tupac Shukar. What could possibly make this movie the WORST dark comedy of all comedies? The film isn't overly humorous, and actually contains some eerie moments.

The parodies of po 'white kitsch are dead-on industrial folk-art, warm Hawaiian Punch served with dinner, Lionel trainsets serving dinner condiments. Sometimes, Akroyd really takes off with his character and delivers hilariously colorful monologues.  They are so convincingly absurd, even if you've never encountered backwater coal town judges before (who has, really), you just KNOW that he has somehow psychically funneled the souls of dozens of them and run them through his comedic prism.Believe me, this movie deserves so much more credit than others here give it.

Soon the four people find themselves being held against their will for reasons that they really don't know. As a comedy NOTHING BUT TROUBLE is a complete disaster because there simply aren't any laughs. As entertainment NOTHING BUT TROUBLE works because it's just so downright bizarre, strange and surreal that you must say that you really haven't seen anything like it before. If THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE had been turned into an attempted comedy then it probably would have turned out something like this and it really does seem that Aykroyd's character, an elderly judge with a penis shaped nose, was fashioned after Grandpa in the classic horror film. But, where do we start with this thing? I must admit that I'm really not sure what Aykroyd was trying to do here because there's really never an attempt to make anything funny. In a comedy you expect a fresh stream of running jokes but honestly that doesn't happen here and instead it seems as if the director just wanted to be strange for the most part and every once in a while throw out an unfunny joke. The majority of the jokes either come from Chase marking a smart remark about something or the various deformities of the family are poked fun at. I already mentioned the nose that is shaped like a penis but one of the strangest bits come from a couple mutant children whose extra boobs and obese bellies are constantly bouncing. These two creatures are never funny but instead you just look at them like the characters and are just disturbed by how ugly they are. You also feel rather surreal being trapped in this environment so I guess if Aykroyd did anything right it's that he created a very strange atmosphere. The entire cast seems to be having a good time and everyone appears to be in on the joke. John Candy gets to play the town cop as well as his twin sister who of course gets a crush on Chase. NOTHING BUT TROUBLE was considered a disaster when it was first released but fans of bad movies or just flat out weird ones should at least be able to stay entertained.

The humor is my kind of humor, dark, a bit macabre and a bit of gross-out humor. It simply was too strange to appeal to a wide audience. Supposedly the whole plot of being pulled over for speeding happened to Aykroyd in the late 70's in New England and he thought it was funny enough to warrant a comedy feature. Well, it didn't work out so well. It might have fared better as a scene in another movie entirely. I thought the scene where they drive through the back country to coal mines and junkyards was a bit eerie since it reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And I don't believe it was intended to be creepy! The idea of a 100+ year old running a backwoods courtroom with absolute power in his own fiefdom does make for a good backdrop. In the horror genre! Why I like about this film is that Aykroyd reminds me of so many old timers who're vets of law enforcement and as such it hits close to home for me. Additionally,the archaic metaphorical anecdotes are so un-intelligible and odd, you can't help but laugh at the JP's posturing and conviction of it all. Daniel Baldwin's bit gives another comedic attempt, the outcome is almost not funny had it not been so light-hearted. This is why I think it failed. No one knew quite what to make of it.

In all honesty, your reviews just make you sound like some pompous jerk. Personally, I love this movie. Of course, I especially enjoy making fun of it.

With a cast like this, how could this movie possible be bad? If you haven't seen it, there's probably a good reason.Without going into an attempted plot analysis, because the actual plot of the movie is a few people trying to escape a crazy junkyard/bunker/haunted house while attempted dark humor and a few slapstick gags are supposed to be enough to make up for the lack of a back story. To sum it up, you see Dan Aykroyd in some horrible makeup that makes him look like old and disgusting. Without warning there are two fat guys in slimy fat suits who, according to the movie, were kicked out of high school for being too fat. But for some reason they run around in underwear and talk like babies. It might sound funny when reading the description, but it isn't&#x85;at all.Then you have John Candy in drag for no reason except to waste a few minutes with the usual ugly-cross-dressing-man who make comedic passes at one of the stars. While they try to distract you with this, the movie tries to force a spark between Demi Moore and Chevy Chase which never works at all and also has no back story to make these character slightly real.Most of the way through the movie you feel dirty and ashamed that you're watching such a bad movie. But there is a silver lining Digital Underground.Completely out of nowhere, Digital Underground shows up at this deserted fortress thing that is supposedly within about 45 minutes of New York City, yet is down some deserted dirt road miles outside of a very small town&#x97;this road at one point was described as being parallel with the interstate, yet people get lost there all the time. Furthermore, one part of the movie reveals that all these famous missing people were killed in this crazy junkyard/madhouse. The even find Jimmy Hoffa's ID. So this middle of the nowhere place somehow manages to secretly arrest and/or kill hundreds, if not thousands of people over the years, but no one ever noticed? But luckily, Digital Underground shows up in the courthouse. They say they are musicians, and Dan Aykroyd, as the insane old judge, tells them to play for him. Now this movie turns into a short music video for Humpty Hump and Tupac. They do a nice performance, despite the fact that at one point Ayrkoyd's character is playing some kind of old organ for a solo. The sheer randomness of this music video, along with the complete horribleness of the movie somehow wormed its way into my brain until I decided this movie is awesome and worthy of encouraging other people to watch.DISCLAIMER If you watch this movie, do not blame me for the time you wasted. But it will be worth it.

Even after repeated viewing I can find a laugh or two. It seems so much shorter to me than it's actual playing time. Playing time is what it's all about. This hilarious, Gothic comedy is a non stop ride of action and sight gags. The dialog is pertinent to the story, well spoken and never lost under an onslaught of music or special effects. Speaking of music, The Digital Underground segment is inspired, showing that cultures can coexist in the spirit of fun. The cast is entertaining to watch. Chevy Chase playing it straight, proving he can really act. Demi Moore as lovely and accomplished as ever. The late John Candy believable as a man caught in the family trap, and hilarious as his sister. Dan Aykroyd taking hours to get into make-up, at a point in his career where he obviously did not need to resort to such masochism to prove his worth or talent. The story has many surprises the first couple of times through. It does not seem like a rewarmed version of anything else. It comes off as fresh and inspired. The set is as original as anything I've seen. I love the gadgets, the props dept. kept it believable. I find this movie worth watching a couple of times a year, but no more often than that, laughs work best if they take you by surprise. So don't study this movie, try to forget it, save for when you really need to lighten your mood. It's a happy pill if you just sit back and turn off your brain.

What it is is a truly original, wacky, mad-cap romp into the world of the absurd with a cast that is more than willing to put everything out there and be moronic.  Dan Aykroyd did a perfect job portraying two outrageous characters as well as directing.  Chevy Chase (in his last funny role, though he's somewhat of a straight-man here), Demi Moore, John Candy, Taylor Negron, et al, do a great job.  This is especially funny if you've spent time on the East Coast in these towns (yes, I have!)  In Pennsylvania (where I lived for a short few years), there is a town called Centralia that has had an underground mine-fire burning for DECADES.  Barely anyone lives there (most were successfully relocated eons ago, but some still hold-out in the multiple-chimney'd homes).  The resemblance to these minor hamlets is remarkable and hilarious.  Aykroyd caught all of the little minor details (like serving warm-Hawaiian Punch at dinner, etc.), which makes it a true American Cinematic classic.  Look, I've reviewed tons of art-house and classic films for different magazines, but I'm certainly not above lowbrow humor like this.  It's worth watching (especially in repeat viewings where it truly comes alive.)  Don't let the bad press get to you, this was funny over a decade ago (God, I feel so old suddenly), and it's still funny today.Enjoy.

It was with a growing sense of horror that I realized that I had rented what is inarguably the worst film ever released from a major studio. This is the cinematic equivalent of a train wreck. You want to look away from the carnage, but you just can't. I just can not imagine what Dan Aykroyd was thinking when he decided to film this monstrosity. It isn't so much a misguided attempt as it is an abortion. The only cast member who seems to have any faith in the product is Dan Aykroyd himself, who approaches his multiple roles with a relish. Sadly, the script just does not warrant his enthusiasm, despite the fact that he wrote it himself. Everyone else seems to be at least mildly embarassed by the piece and seem unusually subdued, even the wooden Chevy Chase. The production design is rather amazing. A great deal of money was spent on making this gothic cartoon, but to so little effect. You watch in disbelief as scene after scene builds up to a crescendo of... nothing. There is so little to laugh about and even less to care about. If each and every character had fallen into the shredding device at the end of the first reel, it still would have been twenty minutes too much. If you enjoy bad movies, this one should definitely warrant your attention. Empty-headed, badly scripted, and poorly acted, it is not impossible to imagine that Mr. Aykroyd was somehow channeling Ed Wood's spirit when he was making this film. I can only recommend this film as an example of just how wrong a project can go.

Was happy to have found the DVD yesterday. Watched it again and was equally amazed by the huge amount of over the top details and twists. I remember watching it, not knowing what I was looking. missed the first ten minutes I think. So it was only until after the end I was enlightened about Dan Aykroyd playing both the judge and one of his creepy grandsons. That discovery only added to my delight about this movie. Because it was yet another surprise. And this film is full of twists and surprises. It keeps getting wackier and wackier. Every time you think you got everything down something happens that you couldn't have imagined. It gets gross, it gets creepy and definitely uncomfortable, it gets absurd. --SMALL SPOILER-- For example The party that has been arrested is offered a dinner (this sounds nicer than it actually is). First they serve grey looking big sausages. Then the middle of the table changes into a model train track and you can't believe they actually made that. Then the train starts to run by with all kind of sauces like ketchup, mustard etc. The judge, who looks really awful, demonstrates in a very distasteful way how to add ketchup to your sausage. It makes you feel nauseous. And just when you think you've had it, there is a shot of Chevy Chase looking at the judge's nose and he sees the glans of a penis. --END OF SPOILER-- Maybe I have a strange sense of humor or enjoy movies for a different reason than most people, but I really liked the creativity, the attention to detail, the surprises, the over the top story, and the nice finale. The set designers must have had a vivid fantasy because there are some set pieces that are truly incredible (all kinds of gadgets, but also the exterior of the judge's house). I think Dan Aykroyd is brilliant as the judge. I would say all other parts are supporting roles. I would put this movie in the same category as Shaun of the Dead. A kind of horror-comedy-adventure. Although I think Shaun of the Dead includes more belly laughs. And the comedy in Nothing but Trouble is more dark. If you're looking for a National Lampoon kind of comedy, skip this movie. But if you expect a very strange, creepy, over the top, dark-comedy with some horror elements that makes you feel uncomfortable at times and laugh with anxiety at other times, this is for you.

I couldn't even remember who was in it quite right (I looked through almost all of Steve Martin's movies before finding he wasn't in it - I was thinking of Chevy Chase's character), but I knew John Candy had some kind of really screwed up role.  In fact, he had two, one of whom was a revolting, odd woman who Chevy Chase is condemned to marry.  I looked through a bunch of Candy's movies and... aha!  Here it is.  Now I can tell you not to see this movie, assuming you don't enjoy feelings of intense misery.The actual details of the plot are hazy in my memory, and really they aren't important in what I have to tell you.  A quick summary will do.  Basically Chevy Chase and Demi Moore get arrested by Dan Aykroyd (who's a cop and a judge and a bunch of other things, I think) in the middle of nowhere, and they're taken to Hell on Earth.  Aykroyd makes them stay in his demented house, which is designed to make being alive as unenjoyable as possible, just like this movie.  He tries to absorb them into his family, and basically makes it so they don't have a normal waking moment where their surroundings let them be themselves.  Chase and Moore pretty much spend the movie trying to escape, roaming through what looks like either a wasteland or a house from a surrealist film (except that it's set in rural America), being beaten down the whole time.Perhaps it started when I saw this movie, perhaps not, but the thought of being trapped in a place with no contact with the outside world, and only a few unbearable people to live with, really scares me now.  After watching this movie I had a braindead feeling.  Maybe you know what I am talking about.  If you watch the movie you will learn.  It's a sort of fuzzy, unhappy feeling, where your mind just goes blank and the world seems like a terrible place to live.  It felt kind of like the time I had a bad case of the flu, when I could only barely tell what was going on, and my hands felt prickly for hours.  Except that the flu gave me something to measure sickly feelings against, and this movie only serves to numb my mind once again every time I recall it.Not only would I not recommend seeing this movie, I would advise that you don't see it.

How can something starring Chase, Aykroyd and Candy be so unfunny? And who actually thought having John Candy in drag was a good idea? I guess Dan Aykroyd did. His script (based on an idea by his brother believe it or not) is so patently off the wall that one wonders how execs felt the need to finance this $40 million dollar project. The main action takes place in a house filled with weird Rube Goldberg-like contraptions and machines that chew up and spit out drug dealers (including a young Daniel Baldwin). But Aykroyd misses nearly every opportunity to capitalize on this weirdness. One would think the decrepit Judge character would latch onto the nubile Moore. Nope. Instead he decides to kill her as Aykroyd leaves the romance between Chase and an in drag Candy. To show how completely off base he was, Aykroyd included a musical number by flavor of the month rappers Digital Underground of The Humpty Dance fame (two years after they were considered cool; look closely for a young, clean-cut 2Pac Shakur in the group before he decide he was a gangster).On the plus side, the film does sport some lavish production values, even if the sets look more like something out of a horror movie. Seriously, I wonder what was being slipped into the soup at the commissary on the Warner Bros. lot during this time period. Within a year, the studio released three surreal, big budget comedy box office bombs (this, STAY TUNED and MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD).

I will also say there are some parts of the film that make me cringe and parts of the film that are kind of irritating as well. This film is about what happens when you get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. A group including two guys and two gals are traveling and get pulled over by a cop who ends up taking them before a judge. He identifies one as a banker for some reason and that is the end of that, he does not intend for them to leave as I would say I was screwed when the floor opened up beneath my feet and I was sent to some strange room filled with squeaky toys. Well this is only the beginning as they then must dine with the freaky judge and his absolutely strange family. And things for the most part keep getting worse and worse for two of the people, as the other two a brother and sister make a run for it. The movie gets more and more bizarre from there as there are a host of strange characters and places to see as they continue to have nothing but trouble. Like I said, some of the comedy works and some of it does not. When it fails at times it fails big time. A lot of the actors play multiple roles too, and I have to say I did not really care for Candy as the daughter of the judge. I liked his cop character better and he departs the film fairly early. Aykroyd is rather good as the fairly insane judge and as the bizarre person that lives in the junkyard. Chevy Chase and Demi Moore do all right as the couple who must live through this mess.

As a fan of black, twisted comedy, I actually enjoyed this bent, twisted film.It is true this isn't the type of stupid, slapstick juvenile humor that many people were expecting from this group of actors. It isn't a laugh-out-loud ha ha kind of film. The humor comes in strange juxtapositions, irony, satire, and the type of grossness associated with any horror film (e.g. dead bodies, bones, creepy houses, cannibals, etc.). I thought overall the film was amusing, with some very funny, yet also some very uncomfortable, moments (as in any black comedy). The dinner party with the condiment train, and the Brazillionaires swimming the toxic river that smells like Sao Paulo made me laugh, and I enjoyed trying to figure out all the junk in the house (a very cluttered mise-en-scene, indeed).The film struck me as a bizarre cross between a demented Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass and The Addams Family (esp. the original New Yorker cartoons, far more disturbing than the films), along with some Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Rocky Horror Picture Show thrown in (as well as any other film with psychotic, mutant families in a rural area who capture people and subject them to torture, such as the original The Hills Have Eyes). I would agree it has some of the sensibility of Raimi's Evil Dead series; it also reminded me at times of the old midnight movies we used to see when I was younger (especially Eraserhead, A Boy and His Dog, The Corpse Grinders--a truly bad movie by the way--and Pink Flamingos).Those who think I am stretching on the Alice connection should consider that basically the characters go into the rabbit hole (or through the looking glass) into a strange alternative, topsy-turvy world based on a 16th century charter (hence the shire reeve), with its own Tweedledum and Tweedledee (the arguing twins Diane finds outside the house). As in Wonderland, this world operates according to its own medieval logic, where those who are deemed evil (including bankers), take a ride on the death-bringing Bonestripper amusement-ride-from-hell, while others are somewhat arbitrarily released if they amuse the judge. It has a twist you can spot a mile away (that's part of the fun, actually), and an ending clearly alluding to Looney Tunes cartoons.I think those who really disliked this film or were disappointed in it probably didn't get it; maybe some of those responding here were just too young when they saw it (I can see where it might give someone nightmares, despite its low blood-and-gore factor). In my view, those who marked it as the worst must not have seen a huge number of films, as this certainly isn't the worst film ever made by far (Both Ator films come to mind, as well as Manos, the Hands of Fate). I could name about 100 other films, just from the U.S., that qualify as true turkeys, far more horrid, or dull, than this film, but for the sake of space, I won't.

After taking a turn off the New Jersey Turnpike they enter Valkenvania, where they're pulled over by a police officer for not stopping at an intersection. So they are hauled back to a junky looking mansion in the middle of nowhere, where they must stand trail in front of the Justice of the Peace Alvin Valkenheiser. They soon enough discover that this absurd madhouse won't let them go so easily for breaking the law. Oh, there's trouble! Sometimes there's bad, and then there's intolerably bad. Mmmm&#133; what a ploddingly disastrous fiasco in self-indulgence Nothing but Trouble turned out to be! I've always enjoyed the comical antics of Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and John Candy, but on this occasion it's a feebly miserable venture straining for laughs and excitement. It's guilty as sin for not being funny&#133; and its supposed to be a flip-out comedy of extreme weirdness. I thought the one idea concept behind the pitch-black premise, wasn't bad and the visual playground of gimmicks had it moments. Instead of being an all out dark and disturbing broad comedy, it goes lightweight with the material that it just didn't feel right and the overwrought build-ups are too silly or gross that it has you rolling your eyes. So the ghoulish twist about it (that has that Motel Hell feel to it), is plain scary for all the wrong reasons. Dan Aykroyd (unrecognisable in his grotesque makeup) might play dual roles in the film, but he was also behind ridiculously wretched screenplay and gleefully disjointed direction. It was a messy vision that we got and he truly goes beyond with it all. It even takes time out to spin out a hip-hop tune midway through the film and this didn't help its already slack pace. The manic art-direction was fine and there are some nice camera angles on show. So, there were a 'few' reasonable aspects, but really these things are largely overshadowed by its goldmine of unpleasantness. Aykroyd's totally noisy and downright coarse performance is unbearable. Chase is his usual dryly-suave self with the occasional quick-witted response, but more often he looks awkward. If it weren't for a few of his one-liners and a radiantly gorgeous Demi Moore&#133; the off switch would've come into play. Moore is okay, without doing a whole lot. An also amusing Candy seems wasted (even if he too, had dual parts) and is the only one I feel truly sorry for in the cast. Though, again it just gets you thinking&#133; why and how they get involved in this farcical. I just don't know what to make of it. This doleful comedy exercise thinks it's funnier than it actually is and that's not a good sign when that's the case.

Reading between the lines, most preceding reviews seem to reflect disappointment that it didn't achieve its potential. In retrospect, Nothing But Trouble would seem to work better as a dark comedy, akin to the original The Ladykillers or Dr. Strangelove. It ends up like a series of loosely connected skits with which Ackroyd can't decide whether to go for horror or humor; trying to both effectively seems beyond him (perhaps beyond anyone using this material). The violence and grim surroundings juxtaposed with goofy characters and garish colors all add up to a mess. Perhaps a result of too many components.

No, it is simply a stand-alone comedy brought to life by the legendary New Age Comedian Dan Aykroyd (The Blues Brothers), whose SNL skits were a million times funnier than this dreck.Of course, the names are attractive Chevy Chase, Demi Moore, Dan Aykroyd, and John Candy. The finished product of their strained efforts is not.Inspiration? Who needs it! A traveling businessman (Chase) gives his conveniently attractive (and available!) neighbor (Moore) a ride to New Jersey. On the way there, he takes a scenic detour that leaves them crashing into a road sign. A desperate cop bored out of his mind (Candy) takes them to The Judge (Aykroyd), a 106-year-old frailing man with decrepid features and peeling skin. Everything about him and his dark, scary home is perverse and sickening. At dinner, Chase and Moore learn the hard way that when this guy asks if they want hot dogs, he really means it.Candy also plays another character, a mute female who has the unfortunate task of being Aykroyd's daughter. He - er, she - tries to marry Chase in the movie. Umm...John Candy, what were you thinking?It's hard to explain the sheer awfulness of this film. It must simply be seen to be rightfully understood. With such A-list talents as Chase, Moore (fresh off of 1990's blockbuster Ghost), Candy, and Aykroyd, one would expect better. Much better. The fact that Dan Aykroyd not only directed but also wrote this movie is depressingly disturbing.It's weird and over-the-top. Take, for instance, the scene involving a funhouse-type rollercoaster train that twists along and launches its victims straight into a man-eating giant lawnmower blade invention. I'm not laughing. It's actually pretty painful to watch such Hollywood talents react to this kind of stuff.The movie isn't funny. That's its main flaw. The other is that for being a dark lightweight romp it's too dark and yet, at the same time, too over-the-top. There's a scene where Aykroyd, now disguised as two disgusting freak creatures living in the junkyard outside The Judge's house, kidnap Moore and attempt to show off how disgusting they are. It's too gross and too silly and too dark and too obnoxious. For being someone who has helped cook up some very light (and great) comedies (The Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters), Aykroyd seems to be trying to change his style here. This works with some directors. But only those who have already established themselves as accomplished directors of a certain style of filmmaking. This is Aykroyd's first (and probably last) mainstream effort. Why start out on a bad note?The puzzling question remains long after the credits stop rolling. This is the first instance in which an ex-SNL alumni has gotten the chance to try his hand at directing. Sadly, it will probably never happen again.Nothing But Trouble is rated PG-13 for language, violence, vulgarity, crudeness, sexual references, and a twisted reflection upon life.

It's putrescence. The whole purpose of the movie is to see how disgusting it can get while not getting banned outright. The premise - family gets lost, run into hicks who have a human-sausage-making-machine. Family tries to make them into sausage. There's the movie. I have no idea what the actors were thinking - this isn't a comedy, it's a crappy remake of Motel Hell (which itself is a bad movie anyhow). There is nothing redeeming about it. Go see one of the many excellent films these guys were involved in. But avoid this film.

This movie is as funny as that, because they both involve a backwoods creep show of a family, trying to kill normal people... the only thing this movie is missing is the hilarious antics of Leatherface. This is not a movie for everyone and considering the majority of the votes this movie received, it does not seem like many people enjoyed it whatsoever. This is a decent movie with a decent, ( if not slightly bad) plot.-Anthony P.s.

I am writing just to fill space, I just wanted to report the goof.I could not see the whole movie, but I think it is worth viewing for its freaky characterizations (e.g. the two fat boys are terrible!, also the Judge).

Plot has something to do with Chevy Chase and Demi Moore stumbling upon The Judge (Dan Aykroyd) and his mansion. When Judge doesn't let them go, they realize he is insane and evil and that he has some nasty habits. John Candy plays both a cop and a woman. I think that's all you need to know regarding that situation.The movie just is really stupid, dark and weird. The part where the Judge is entertained by musical folk is the point when I gave up on the movie. The idea of Dan Akyroyd also playing two inborn twins is also disgusting, as is the hot dogs scene and the entire film for that matter. If you're a fan of any of the actors involved (especially John Candy, like me), skip this one and never turn back.0/5 stars -John Ulmer "}]
