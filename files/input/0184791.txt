Tragedy follows.  Fast-paced, somber and disturbing.  The characters talk and act like real kids--you get to know and understand them so the violence that erupts at the end is very upsetting.  Excellent acting, especially by Julia Stiles (as Odin's girlfriend Desi), Phifer and Hartnett (who's absolutely chilling).  The only bad acting is by Sheen--way too over the top.  This is an extreme film--lots of swearing, a disturbing sex scene and the killings at the end.  Worth seeing but depressing.  Sat on the shelf for 2 years because Miramax was afraid of it.

The theme of revenge, love and jealousy remains intact but the settings have been changed. Great actors in the three leading roles (Stiles, Phifer, Hartnett) makes this movie feel alive, and the cursing and violence makes it feel even more real. The ending is scary and sad, and it makes you think for a long time after you've seen it.Along with Donnie Darko and Ghost World, this is one of the best movies aimed at teens I've seen.***/****  "},{"Title":"One of the better retellings of Shakespeare to date. ***1/2 (out of four)","Date":"7 September 2001","Score":"28 out of 38 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller","Review":"  O / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)After the disastrous attempts the last decade has made at updating Shakespeare, I eventually thought that it was nearly impossible to successfully modernize anything of the genre. Shakespeare's themes and ideas can still relate with many aspects of society today, but seldom do filmmakers incorporate modern culture with the timeless stories told so long ago. O is like a slap in the face that proves my theory wrong. Based on Shakespeare's play Othello, this isn't the first time Hollywood has tried to translate the tragic masterpiece onto film. In 1995, Laurence Fishburne starred in Oliver Parker's unsuccessful adaptation of the play. This time around, director Tim Blake Nelson has finally completed a victorious version of the story.and it's takes the form of a high school drama.The film takes place in an elite private school located in the American South. Mekhi Phifer (I Still Know What You Did Last Summer) stars as the title character, named Odin James, the only African American student at the school. That doesn't interfere with his reputation or image, however, because he's the school's defining figure. Rewarded MVP by the school's basketball team, he's a virtual celebrity with the student body, the basketball coach (Martin Sheen), as well as his beautiful girlfriend, Desi Brable (Julia Stiles of  Save the Last Dance), the daughter of the Dean of Palmetto Grove Academy (John Heard).Hugo Goulding (Josh Hartnett of Pearl Harbor), the son of the basketball coach, is Odin's best friend. He's asked by his father to look out for Odin because of the straining pressures of Palmetto Grove Academy. Little does anyone know, however, Hugo is dangerously envious of Odin and the attention he receives. On the outside, Hugo is friendly to all of his basketball teammates, including Odin, but on the inside, he's concocting a bitterly evil plan that will render more than just the social status of his classmates.This tale of treachery, jealousy, and mistrust will introduce a new audience to the genius of William Shakespeare and some of his most intriguing and intelligent characters. In this version, the film changes the original metaphor of war into that of high school sports. It's startling how the themes of the classic story translate so well to the lives of modern young people. The film thoroughly examine the emotions of its characters. Through jealousy, favoritism, trust, and envy, to popularity, conformity, and the extreme measure some will take to fulfill their feelings, O looks into the heart of darkness, not through a sadistic serial killer or demonic monster, but through one of the most dangerous figures of all, a friend with ulterior motives.Working against an inconsistent editing style and an uneven soundtrack, the actors do an exceedingly well job with their difficult characters. Josh Hartnett delivers a performance that isn't excessive or physically violent, but instead internal and intelligent. He gives his character a face for the complex emotions. He doesn't seek satisfaction through random temper tantrums, but through developing a full scale plan. Julia Stiles projects a charming, passionate chemistry with her supporting characters. Mekhi Phifer also furnishes a strong, convincing image of Odin.Perhaps O doesn't fully exceed it's potential. It doesn't develop such possible themes as racism or one-sidedness. While creating a strong message on keeping friends close, but enemies closer, the film fails to examine a handful of themes that would have made the powerful, tragic conclusion even more effective.O was originally completed in 1998, but because of the recent violence in real life high schools, the studios were uncertain about it's content and rescheduled its release date numerous times. Maybe these actions say something about the movie's impact and how influential it may become. In that case, why wait to release O if the message is something today's teens need to witness, both to inform them on Shakespeare and to demonstrate the dangerous results of envy and jealousy.

It definitely highlights the theme of 'Everything comes full Circle,' which the Title 'O,' implies. It also concentrates on minor themes such as racism and exploits the human emotions of jealousy and love and how it is such a tender thing which can be easily manipulated. It also portrays how dangerous love is ... as we understand that if Odin didn't really love Desi he wouldn't have gone to such extremes when he discovered her 'betrayal.'Most of the acting was mediocre at best. I am surprised that Julia Stiles (playing Desi Brable) played an important character but had little screen time, her character Desi was also a little nondescript (compared to Shakespeare's version of her character, Desdemona, who is much more interesting and expresses the virtues of goodness and honesty much more effectively). Elden Henson, Andrew Keegan and Rain Phoenix (Roger Rodriguez, Michael Cassio and Emily respectively), playing supporting roles also gave mediocre performances, I found Rain Phoenix especially poor in parts. Mekhi Phifer (Odin James) and Josh Hartnett (Hugo Goulding) give superb performances, both expressing their characters effectively with great skill.Of course adapting the script from Shakespeare's play would've been difficult but for a better version of Shakespeares' Othello the pace of the film should've been slower and should have concentrated more on the character's and their feelings...this film actually seemed to focus more screentime on action more than it should've...or needed to.However the tragic tale was efficiently portrayed and extremely well delivered, it's an enjoyable film. The ending was also quite sad and was worthy of the build-up during the film. The tragedy of how Odin was twisted by Hugo into destroying the one thing he truly loved was sickeningly realised. Overall a nice film in its own way.Watch it! You won't regret it, but in my opinion, some parts of the film could've been much better.- Milla.  "},{"Title":"Modernized Shakespeare at its best","Date":"19 March 2003","Score":"16 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller","Review":"  The high point of O is that its probably the best modern adaptation of Shakespeare to date.  However, given competition such as 10 Things I Hate About You, its not much of a compliment.  Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet was a wonderfully artistic movie, but keeping the original dialogue, a risky premise from the outset in a modern background, harmed the flow of the movie, making it seem incongruous.  O gets it right, adapting modern language to emphatically convey emotion.  For those who haven't picked up on it by now, O is a modernization of Shakespeare's Othello.O is Odin James(Mekhai Phifer), the protagonist, whose good intentions and tragic flaws work against him when provoked.  James' fame comes from his incredible prowess on the basketball court.  Odin is a knockout NBA prospect and the center of attention wherever he goes, and seems to have everything, including the dean's daughter as his girlfriend, Desi(Julia Stiles).  The glory bestowed upon Odin draws ferocious envy one of his friends, Hugo(Josh Hartnett), who plots a scheme playing on Odin's jealous nature to break Odin and Desi up and, in the process, give him some sense of satisfaction.  The story that ensues is stellar (naturally, as it is based off of one of Shakespeare's best works).  But, as Othello is a tragedy, O can only come to a tragic end...I felt the emotional prescence in this movie much more than I expected to, much more than I would have had had the movie toned its violence and sexual imagery down to snag a more desirable PG-13 rating.  Phifer is very convincing in his role as Odin, especially in the dunk contest and the sex scene with Julia Stiles, breathing a murderous rage into a character tragically bound to demise despite his better efforts and honesty.  His presence drives the movie, his raging jealousy a brash contrast with Hugo's cool and ruthless methods of deception.I was very pleased that the issue of race wasn't expounded upon in the movie (as I expecting when I saw the first preview).  It holds true to Shakespeare's original intention, which pictures Othello as a Moor, a person with a strange fasion of dress and appearance.  I don't believe Shakespeare meant to make an issue or a statement on race in Othello, and, despite what I'm sure was a juicy temptation, the writers hold true to this, except for one comment Odin makes, which makes sense.  To ignore the issue would be foolish if making a true modernization of the play, but it never becomes a main focus of the film.  The only thing I would change is to not make Hugo such a sympathetic character.  Iago (Hugo's counterpart in Othello) was an insanely evil character, with little reason to feel a bit of pity or sympathy for his deeds and his motives.  Hugo's father clearly neglects his own son's well-being in deferrence to Odin, an important plot element in O that is absent from Othello, making Hugo much more pitious than Iago.  Also, some of the scenes felt a bit rushed.  Other than this, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can handle it; some of the scenes are very intense.  I gave it an 8 out of 10.

With the help of his adapter, Brad Kaaya, they transferred Venice to South Carolina with mixed results. Mr. Nelson, being an actor himself, got great readings from his mostly young cast.Bringing Shakespeare to locations other than where the plays were set, presents an unusual challenge for whoever undertakes the risk. In this case, the action occurs in a small prep school in South Carolina where the emphasis is thrown to the basketball team and its star. Odin James, the role based on Othello, the Moor of Venice, is the main attraction at the basket ball court. Odin, who is black has fallen in love with Desi, or Desdemona, the fair young woman who loves him in return. When Odin selects Michael to be his right hand man at the court, Hugo, the envious son of Coach Goulding, resents being bypassed and begins to plot what to do to get back at O. The film follows the machinations of Hugo who succeeds in creating a doubt in O by poisoning his mind with tales of deceit and betrayal from both Michael and Desi. That makes Hugo scheme a plan to get rid of his rival, but he can't see what his lies have done to O's soul and the ultimate tragedy this careless young man will bring to his family and to the school.Mikhi Phifer is good as the tormented Odin, the star of the game who is going to go far because of his natural talent for the game. Julia Stiles, an intelligent presence in anything she does, is effective as the young Desi, whose only fault is having fallen in love with Odin. Josh Harnett, on the other hand, seems to be miscast as Hugo, who is the Iago of the real play. Andrew Keegan is good as Michael. Martin Sheen, John Heard, Rain Phoenix and Elden Henson, are the most prominent figures in the cast.Tim Blake Nelson shows an affinity for directing. Maybe his new projects will give him an opportunity in which to shine better. "},{"Title":"Uhh... was that supposed to be sad at the ending? Or were we allowed to laugh?

There are so many aspects that are just not up to scratch here, the acting, the characters, the script (especially the plot) and direction, which is as bad as I have seen in a movie in a longtime. O is based on Shakespeare's play called &#145;Othello', but after seeing this film and not liking it, I would rather read Shakespeare or see this story on Broadway, because at least then I would know I might be seeing something better than this garbage.In the elite private school of Palmetto Grove, Odin &#145;O' James is the only black student. He is a NBA hopeful, possessing the talent to go straight from high school to the pros. O is also dating the prettiest girl in the school, Desi Brable. They are the envy of all their friends &#150; having found a love that is deep, honest and pure. O's best friend, Hugo, is on the same basketball team and the son of Coach Duke Goulding. Hugo has been asked by his father to look out for O but, in reality, Hugo is seeking to destroy the very person he pretends to befriend. As his jealousy of O increases, so does Hugo's determination to bring him down. He has a plan, a dark scheme to destroy O and using every conceivable, wicked ploy, he may just do it.The makers of this film cannot avoid getting a spray from me in this review. Director Tim Blake Nelson, did what I would say was an ordinary job in directing &#145;O'. Some of his choices as camera shots are not at all clever or convincing, and the movie has a very &#145;stop/start' flow that makes it difficult to watch. Nelson needed to look at how Roger Kumble delicately put together Cruel Intentions, because that movie was cleverly directed.However Blake is not the only one who will be getting a serve from me about this film. The screenplay for this film was written by Brad Kaaya and was not as good as it could have been. I like how movies try to use legendary stories from many generations ago, such as Shakespeare, but for some reason this screenplay was just not up to the mark. The plot to the film is just not good enough, as it does not make much sense at many stages, especially at the end. Another bad side to it was the characters developed for the story, such as O and Hugo, who are characters I did not like.Which leads me to the acting in this film. O (Mekhi Phifer) is a guy at the start of the movie that we can see is a huge basketball talent and has a great girlfriend, Desi. Then halfway through the movie this guy turns nasty and from where I viewed it, for no apparent reason, other then listening to the evil plans of Hugo. I do not want to give the whole film away, but there is a scene with O that could have been ok if the film did not over do it. O is going through an NBA trial, which he shows to be a breeze, then after it, he decides to do something that was not very creative, destroying the scene for me. Desi (Julia Stiles) is a very nice girl placed in a situation that is not very good. But for some reason even her character is hard to understand, as some of her lines are just down right silly and/or corny. From my sources, I heard Stiles did this movie, because of her love for Shakespeare, which is fine. But how blind can this girl be? I mean the script for this film was not up to the standard of some of her other work she has done (like 10 things I hate about you and Save the last dance), a great shame.   Then there is Hugo, played by my best mate (Josh Hartnett). His role once again is not very good. What do people see in this guy? The way he looks is not very convincing, as he continues to look like a little boy in over his head. I have seen him in a few roles where he is the good guy, and I have not liked him. Seeing him as a bad guy here, would you believe, I think is even worse. Another criticism of Hartnett from me is the way he speaks in both his acting and in voice-overs (that were disgraceful!) in this film. To me, Josh sounds like he is &#145;whispering', just not good enough.There are some very distressing scenes in this film, like I have never seen before. O and Desi have a very strange sex scene that I did not find the least bit arousing. You have the sequence at a basketball match where Roger (Elden Henson) is totally harassed and ridiculed, by Michael (Andrew Keegan) and a friend, which is very hard to watch. I know what that guy felt like. Then to top it all of, Hugo's crazy plan is one of the worst parts of a film that I have ever seen. It is unusual, awkward and gut wrenching, especially what we see O do to poor Desi, not pleasant at all.    I am the least bit sorry for being harsh towards this film, as it deserves every bit of criticism it gets. I was hesitant to watch the film and in a way I am glad I did, as I now know how bad it is. I recommend people stay away from &#145;O', instead watch &#145;Cruel Intentions' or &#145;10 things I hate about you', which are much classier movies. Finally this movie has left me with a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth, when it comes to friends and relationships. I know I will be careful choosing both sorts of people in the future.

Instead of Othello being the military captain of Venice, he's the star player on a basketball team named Odin. Okay, acceptable, and a sweet name. Michael (Cassio) is invited to share in Odin's VIP award instead of Hugo (Iago), which makes him angry, and he plans to break Odin and Dessy (Dezzy? Desi? Whatever, Desdemona) with Roger (Roderigo). This is typical, this is what I expected not creative whatsoever, but still acceptable. Unfortunately, they ruined it by trying very hard to make it edgy. If you are like me and hated 10 Things I Hate About You, you will hate this movie more. The insufferable Julia Stiles is back as Desi and ruins yet another perfectly good Shakespearian character. Desdemona is supposed to be sweet and innocent, not another Godforsaken feminist nuisance. Hugo is boring, typical my parents don't pay attention to me at home cut cut cut r-tard who does drugs and swears. Michael is an incredibly unlikable wimp. Emily is weirdly ugly and looks about forty years old and has negative personality. The only, and I repeat ONLY, good thing in this entire movie is Odin. His acting is pretty decent, he is very emotional, and his facial expressions are excellent. At least there was one good actor in this movie. The problem is the horrible jumping from scene to scene every ten seconds, which is more annoying than it sounds, and all the characters' initial charm in the play is completely gone. I find myself looking forward to everyone getting murdered because they are all so unlikable. ESPECIALLY Desi. Stiles is probably the worst actress to ever exist, and the fact that she is constantly given the same stupid roles to play only emphasize that fact. However, when Desdemona is supposed to tell her father that she loves Othello, she simply says We've been dating for four months daaaad GAWD it's none of your business even though I'm sleeping with him and greet him by taking my clothes off ever since we started dating. She doesn't even LOOK at Odin in the movie, it makes the audience feel like their relationship is purely physical. In short, all the characters were ruined except Odin/Othello, the acting is atrocious, they screwed up the story, and almost ruined the entire play for me like The Taming of the Shrew was prior to this.

A constant theme in literature and in film, no matter how extreme it is, it always hits close to home because everyone is jealous of someone or something.  Such extreme jealousy is the subject of O, a suspenseful high school drama based on Shakespeare's Othello (which I'm not familiar with, so I'm uncertain how faithful O is to its source) and was held back from release for over a year following the Columbine shootings, at a time when everything that involved teenagers and violence was censored in the paranoid American media.  Thankfully, the film was not shelved permanently, as such would be a great loss to the art of film.	Any drama relies heavily on the cast to make it believable, and O sports what was easily the best teen cast as well as one of the best casts overall in 2001.  Mekhai Phifer is one to watch (though he isn't as typecast in teen roles as the other leads) as Odin, the betrayed, and the most real character in the movie.  Unsure of who to trust, and played for a fool by his devious jealous friend Hugo (Josh Hartnett), one feels his disparity and paranoia.  Less than a week after seeing (and trashing) him in the horrid 40 Days and 40 Nights, Josh Hartnett redeems himself and shows that, given the right character, his relative coldness and stoic nature can work well; O is without a doubt his best performance, and hopefully this has opened an opportunity for him away from awful bubble gum romance flicks.  The final lead liberated from teen-movie hell is Julia Stiles' Desi, who is just as confused and angry as Phifer's Odin.  The pair has some chemistry at the beginning, but when the lies and allegations arrive the two ignite.	The film's setting in a prep school in the Carolinas adds much to the character's conflicts, particularly Odin's.  As the only African-American in a Southern private school, another layer to his character is that he still has to contend with proving himself against racism, and his interracial relationship with Desi may still cause controversy in some viewing circles.  As a spoiled rich teen, Hugo is that much more angry when he doesn't get what he wants and is overshadowed by Odin, particularly in his father (the coach of the team)'s eyes.  The sense of privacy and secrecy that a prep school instills in an audience (at least an audience that doesn't attend one) adds even more to the suspense and the complicatedness of Hugo's elaborate plan.	The plan is elaborate, complex, and cold-hearted is relatively easy to follow and unexpected at the same time.  It all fits together perfectly, with only one minor plot hole (what happens to the school mascot?) and one unnecessary detracting character (the drug dealer who appears in a couple scenes without connection to any of the characters).  As it steadily and seamlessly unfolds and the plot thickens, it becomes more amazing that someone like Hugo could even exist and feel so strongly as to commit such despicable acts.  Yet the whole time, Hugo is cool and collected, and his plan never leaves the bounds of realism.  It's powerful, and a terrible vision of the most intimate relationships forced apart in the name of jealousy.	O is one of those rare movies that can take a cast of hot teen faces and really make them shine in a well-written, well-acted film that they can be proud of when they outgrow teen idolatry.  It may turn off their prime audiences, but it shows the rest of us what they are truly capable of if given the opportunity, and with this cast, it is hoped they can be paired with such an excellent, challenging film again.

Trying not to compare `O' with `Othello' is almost impossible.  I would hazard to guess, though, that the majority of the people in the audience who saw this film with me have not read the play, from their gasps of shock at the `surprise' twists.  I think they enjoyed the film quite a lot, and good for them, because there is quite a lot to like about the film.  Here I am mostly thinking of Mekhi Phifer (Odin), Julia Styles (Desi), and Josh Hartnett (Hugo), who turn in astonishingly good performances.  I will get to those nice things in a moment, however, because there are a couple of things I want to point out that made the film difficult for me to enjoy.Firstly, I would like to address the poster for the film.  The poster is, essentially, Josh Hartnett's beautiful face in the top left quadrant, Julia Styles' beautiful face in the top right quadrant, and a tiny little Mekhi Phifer at the bottom, holding a basketball and framed in a large &#145;O'.  This may not be important to the overall enjoyment of the film, but to me, it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Hugo and Desi are not linked romantically in the film (rather, it's Desi and Odin), but they take up about half the poster.  Meanwhile, Odin (the title character) is small and greatly overshadowed.  Now, I thought long and hard about why the poster designers and producers would have done this, and I came to the conclusion that it's because Phifer is black and Styles and Hartnett are white, and, naturally the studio can't put a handsome black man and a beautiful white girl together on the poster.  This kind of attitude is extremely upsetting, and if anyone could clear this matter up for me, it'd be greatly appreciated.  Otherwise, I stand by my diagnosis.Another minor problem that I have with the film centers around the character of Hugo.  Now, Josh Hartnett did an extremely good job portraying the character, and I was very impressed with his acting skills.  I repeat I am NOT putting down Hartnett's performance.  Having said that, I thought that Hugo was a little too sympathetic for my liking.  Iago hates Othello simply  because he chose Cassio instead of him as lieutenant, and this small slight sets him on the quest to ruin the lives of both men.  Hugo, however, is a kid who's underappreciated by his basketball coach dad (Martin Sheen, an actor's actor), and overlooked by his buddy Odin at the MVP ceremony for a mere sophomore.  He's jealous of anyone with more talent than him, which fits Odin to a T.  This basically puts him in the `teenager who's so hard done by' category, and this makes him too sympathetic, especially to teenagers.  After all, what teenager isn't underappreciated by their parents?  What teenager doesn't feel like no-one's paying attention to them?  Instead of being a twisted, Machiavellian villain, Hugo is the High School kid pushed too far and out for revenge.  I would prefer the near-perfect evil of Iago to the misunderstood Hugo any day.Having made these two points, I did quite enjoy the film (even though it may not have appeared so in my previous two paragraphs).  The three main young actors (Phifer, Styles, and Hartnett) put out terrific performances, and there is great screen chemistry between both Phifer & Styles and Phifer & Hartnett.  Martin Sheen is great to watch as a basketball coach on his way to a coronary, Rain Phoenix nails the character of Emily, and even the underused John Heard (as the Dean) adds a few subtle touches.  Tim Blake Nelson's direction is quite commendable, and there are a couple of very creative cinematography tricks; I especially liked the scene where Hugo and his father talk in his office and the camera slowly pans forward in through the window.The film addresses many themes (racism, jealousy, distrust, pride), and although it doesn't take a stand on any of them, the film moved at a good pace and kept the plot as convincingly twisted as it needed to be.  All in all, it was a good movie, exciting if you haven't read the play, and an interesting interpretation of the story if you have.  7/10  "},{"Title":"low-quality modernization","Date":"13 June 2006","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller","Review":" First of all, the makers of O were a little overzealous in being true to the original story Othello (as even the title will attest).

That Hamlet translated very cleverly and appropriately to modern teen culture. Hamlet and his friends as film students! The Ghost behind the play within the play as senior playwright Sam Shepard (while his wife was triumphing in Titus)! Her box of remembrances is an image I will possibly take to my grave.--She was also in a tolerable, but uninspired teen `Shrew.' That makes three teen Shakespeare films in three years. This is no accident, and possibly the sign of that rare species an intelligent young actress. (Really, name one.) And that she was picked by Mamet for a role says a lot.--In her `Save the Last Dance' where she played opposite a black, she completely out hiphopped him. More black than black; I wondered what we would see here, where it could matter.--T B Nelson was in `O Brother,' and with Turturro played just the type of self-reference that Shakespeare uses in Othello, and Turturro did in his own `Illuminati.' These two were so sympatico and intelligent, I just knew he'd do something amazing given this and his past directorial ambitions.--Everyone in the film world knows Welles' Othello, one of the greatest films of all time. With that frame, surely something interesting would result.But we have a miss here. The conception is all wrong. The core idea in the play is an honest man destabilized by treachery. Its important to know how easily destabilized one can be with words, while at the same time Shakespeare pummels us with his own words intent on scaring the bejeesus out of us by tweaking our own souls.Alas, no words here worth listening to. No risk to our own beings. Without risk, there's no Shakespeare, no greatness.Othello was in an honored position because he met the Venetians on their own terms and excelled. Odin excels at the black man's game, a completely trivial part of life. He was sought out by the authorities to win games. We are led to believe he is a poor student and not intrinsically charismatic.So when he is destabilized, we have no reason to think it's not just a case of lowclass dumb jock who's been dissed. The Moor in Elizabethan context was well before the modern notion of `rascism.' The bigotry would have been anti-Catholic. some anti-Jew, and in this study making more fun of the effete Italians than anyone African. He would have been exotic, puzzling. Casting the Moor as Shakespeare's most human character is the equivalent of modern science fiction, shifting the center enough away from the familiar to exaggerate the point. Placing the Moor in the racist US deliberately runs the risk of reducing him to a stereotype, washing all the humanity away. The incessant rap track and the basketball context drive that home. Othello is noble but Odin is a nonentity.Maybe it would have worked if that racist Strom Thurmond was more explicitly cited. Ms. Rain Joan of Arc Phoenix (Bonanza Jellybean) is the best part. Hated to see her shot.

From MacBeth to Ten Things I Hate About You, filmmakers have tried to turn his masterpieces of stage writing into great films.  Some succeed.  Some others, however, turn out like O. If my girlfriend hadn't held my arm as I tried to stand up, I would have left the theater about 40 minutes into this unbearable adaptation.  Okay, fine, the filmmaker tried to stay as true to Shakespeare's original plot and characters as possible.  That alone is admirable.  But when you realize that staying true to the original play prevents you from making a decent movie, wouldn't you just move on to a different project?  Say, one that doesn't seem contrived and trite the entire time? I know we live in an age of teen angst and insecurity (heck, every age is probably such) but how are we supposed to believe that a jealous teenager (Hugo) would embark on such a manipulative mission of sneakiness, and find the willing help of a conveniently placed red-headed geek who is willing to do his bidding?  He launches his plot by manipulating people to do things to upset other people.  Hugo tells his friend Michael that Michael can get back in good favor with their friend Odin by getting closer to Odin's girl.  Um, okay.  That makes sense to me.  If I hang out with his girl more, Odin will understand that I really want to be his friend.  A character that dumb deserves to be shot. Again, maybe in Shakespeare's original play, this kind of plotting and scheming didn't seem so far fetched.  Maybe it sounds better when it's soldiers and dukes and princesses and slaves that are battling for affection and speaking their lines in Shakespeare's eloquent dialect.  But it transferred poorly to this modern adaptation. And I got the feeling that not one of the actors was ever doing more than reciting lines.  I never felt they were acting.  I never thought Julia Stiles was anybody but Julia Stiles.  Odin was just Mekhi Pfifer.  And Josh Hartnett was just horrible.  And it felt like the director slept through the whole process. I can proudly say that this is the worst movie I've seen all summer (and that's a summer that includes debacles like Planet of the Apes and Pearl Harbor).  It should have been left alone in its classic setting, with its classic dialogue, and its classic characters.  I believe there is such a version out there somewhere, starring Laurence Fishburne.

As a modern day version of Othello, it disturbingly depicts teenagers as selfish, drunken, drugged out morons who fight and become terribly obsessed with frivolity. The film starts extremely slow and only begins to pick up once all the killing and backstabbing comes around.  Though I can appreciate the attempt at making it an artist, modern day version, what is depressing most of all about this idiotic display is how it just craps upon the beauty and tragedy that was the original. As a 23 year veteran of stage and a writer, I am personally offended for all my fellow thespians who will be duped into seeing this menagerie of empty characters, beyond reality situations, and dumbed down and hopeless look at today's teenagers.  Believe me, I once was a teacher and have seen how bad, not all, but a lot of teens can be. But this film takes it to a whole new level.  I understand what the writer was attempting to do, but there cannot possibly be any way that the young generation today that will see this film will understand it.  Most will be going to see it's leads Josh Hartnett and Julia Stiles.  The writer, however, seems to fantasize with the idea that anyone who sees this will see it's parallel and meaning.  All I could see was drawn out, unnecessary violence, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and sexuality that I found myself cringing at the thought people will be spending their hard earned money to see this filth.  Don't get me wrong, I am no stiff or goody-two-shoes to say the least.  It's just that film makers today have to draw the line somewhere and it's clear that the film makers with O missed the line completely and practically mocked it.  And to make sure you know I can validate my thoughts and opinions, I spent an hour after the film ended in a Q & A session with the director.  His intentions were clear and sincere.  But I highly doubt anyone who was involved in the creative aspects of this film took more than 5 seconds to step back and look at it as a whole nor did they spend much more time trying to empathize with how ALL the individuals who will see this will take it or feel about it.  I DO NOT recommend this film.  If you are a parent, don't take your kids to see it just because you think you are being responsible chaperones.  Go see it for yourself, if that is what it takes.  I say just leave it to die at the box office where it should leave the heartless investors in debt and regretting their ridiculous attempts at having a piece of the proverbial Hollywood pie.  No one should benefit from this disgusting picture and I hope those who waste their money finding out for themselves will finally realize that Shakespeare + modern day + teenagers is a miserable combination.These are the things most specifically disturbing  A long, drawn out sex scene that eludes to rape; blatant and unnecessary drug use; the lack of rounding out or providing reason to become passionate about the characters, and the horrible adaptation of a timeless masterpiece.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!

This one is called O, and is based on Othello. Stiles plays a white girl named Desi who is in a relationship with Odin, a black student who wins basketball games for the school again and again. Another player, Hugo, becomes jealous and plots to tear Odin and Desi apart.A possible problem in making a movie like O is that it might be interpreted as a racist warning for white women- Ladies, if you're going to date a black guy, be prepared to accept some rape and strangling. (Odin does both to Desi; although she later denies being raped, she technically was because she told Odin to stop and he didn't). But the movie almost certainly isn't trying to promote that kind of message. Perhaps a better view is that race is a secondary issue in O and the real issues are teen jealousy, angst and violence. And that's good subject matter- after the 1999 Columbine high school shootings, teen violence becomes a more relevant issue- there should be more stories trying to tackle it. I found the concept of high school tragedy interesting, and this movie had some solid moments.Still, there are flaws. First off I'll note some of the songs used in this movie just don't fit a tragedy- it's just music that Odin might like. The song Painted On My Heart was used in this movie's brilliant trailer; it should have been used in the movie, too. Turning now to the plot, it's arguable that Odin is too easily manipulated, too quick to deteriorate. We probably don't have enough time to sympathize with him before he goes crazy- like in the rape scene. Beyond that, there are some examples of second-rate acting, like from the girl angry about getting the scarf. Sill, O is entertaining, worth seeing at least.

He has the adoration of all, including the team's coach (Martin Sheen) and Dean's beautiful daughter, Desi (Julia Stiles). Odin's troubled friend Hugo (Josh Hartnett), the coach's son is deeply resentful of his father's preference of Odin on and off the court. When Hugo plots a diabolical scheme to sow the seeds of mistrust between 'O' and Desi, it sets in motion a disturbing chain of events which erupts into a firestorm of breathtaking intensity. 'O' is a stunning tale that will stay with you long after its final, powerful frame, according to the promotional synopsis.And, like it promises O features, Hot young stars, a hip, driving soundtrack, plus a provocative tale of jealousy and betrayal combine to create this controversial modern-day version of Shakespeare's classic, 'Othello.' The Shakespearian plot is still good, after all these centuries. But, the transference of these events to a high school setting doesn't work. As a whole, the actors do not look or act between 14-18 years old; at one point, Mr. James says they're eighteen (a wise age to pick, from range available). Granted, with retention and steroids, many athletes look much older, presently - still, O doesn't balance this with age appropriate casting (or behavior).Making the age matter worse is a script which really doesn't really ring true. This story, with its controversy likely related to violent real-life teenage mass murderers, doesn't possess the degree of teen angst and alienation necessary to bring that slant to the tale. And, it doesn't fit the Othello plot.The cast and direction are very good, though&#x85; why didn't somebody suggest a college setting? ***** O (5/26/01) Tim Blake Nelson ~ Mekhi Phifer, Josh Hartnett, Julia Stiles "},{"Title":"Summary of O and How It Can Be Useful To Journalists","Date":"28 November 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller","Review":" The movie, O was directed by Tim Blake Nelson and released in 2001. O follows closely to the play, Othello, written by William Shakespeare. The movie plot is that Odin James, representing Othello, is the star of the high school basketball team and his best friend, Hugo, envies his popularity and all the attention he receives; therefore Hugo devotes his time to destroying Odin. Throughout the movie, Hugo represents the clever and sneaky antagonist from Shakespeare's play, Iago. Hugo begins to destroy Odin by first convincing him that his girlfriend, Desi is having an affair with Michael Cassio. Hugo then makes it appear true by convincing Michael to spend more time with Desi and by obtaining the scarf, an important symbol of Odin's love for Desi, and giving it to Michael. Odin is hurt and angry and follows Hugo's plan to have both Desi and Michael killed. Odin is devastated to discover he's been deceived and manipulated by his best friend and he commits suicide. In the end Odin's tragic flaws were his trust in Hugo, his assumptions and his jealousy, which all led to his downfall and demise.The major theme of O is the same as the theme in Othello appearance and reality. Throughout the movie, the audience is a witness to all reality aside to what appeared to be.Knowing the story of Othello could help a journalist by showing how important it is never to assume. Odin assumed based on what appeared to be true. Rather than checking into rumors and finding the truth, he assumed that his best friend was telling the truth. This is a good lesson to journalists because it teaches that presumptions are a substitute for researching and demonstrates that assuming leads to misfortune. "},{"Title":"Effective film of one of Shakespeare's tragedies","Date":"8 July 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller","Review":" Strange, how effective O is, despite being somewhat of a mess. Taking one of Shakespeare's plays and updating it to a contemporary high school has been done before (10 Things I Hate About You, for example, which also features Julia Stiles). But those were comedies, or if they were tragedies (like Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Romeo and Juliet), they were made with some sort of gimmick, if you will, to distance them from reality (I guess). Here Tim Blake Nelson puts Shakespeare's tragedy Othello in a contemporary high school setting, but he leaves out any of the flair or flourishes that accompany the other attempts of doing the same. The result is a gritty, and at times highly disturbing, film.Odin James (aka O, played by Mekhi Phifer) is the star basketball player of an exclusive prep school. Resentful of O's fame, and the thankless spot that it leaves him, Hugo (Josh Hartnett) plots to ruin O's career by sowing the seeds of doubt in O regarding his relationship with Desi (Julia Stiles), the dean's daughter.The acting is solid all around. While the actors get off to a rocky start, they eventually come through. Mekhi Phifer is adequate as the jealous O, but he's outshined by Hartnett and Stiles.If you're looking for a chance to ogle Josh Hartnett, rent another one of his movies. He's too creepy here. He's rather quiet and standoffish, which is an effective way of portraying Hugo, because it makes him more frightening than if he was foaming at the mouth, or, God forbid, cackling with maniacal glee. Ditto for Stiles; while she's not creepy, this isn't an opportunity for her to play a sexy character (although she does have a steamy sex scene). Martin Sheen is too over-the-top as the coach (who is Hugo's father), but as the movie goes on, he begins to fit in with the rest of the cast.If there's any problem, it's with director Tim Blake Nelson. He broadens everything so much that it all threatens to blend together into one big soup. There's no crispness in his directing, where one would normally isolate each scene and bring it out individually (to a point). That said, the film's climax is so disturbing that it will leave a sick feeling in many people's stomachs. This is not a teen soap opera; O is as real and affecting as it gets.Nelson's directing isn't a hackjob, though. He may have over-broadened everything, but he knows what he's doing. His choice of camera angles is great, though it threatens to go overboard at some points. He uses shots of the characters at key moments where they don't speak. Because they are so expertly done, they are the most telling moments of the film.Despite its shortcomings, O is a worthwhile film, and one that needs to be seen (though it was perhaps wise that they pushed the release date back after the Columbine tragedy). "},{"Title":"The Bard's story, but not his words","Date":"28 April 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller","Review":" One of the wave of teen-Shakespeare adaptations of the late 1990s/early 2000s, O resets the story of Othello among basketball players at an elite South Carolina prep school. It follows the original story very closely, changing only a few incidents in order to fit with the idea that the characters are now teenagers. For instance, now Hugo (the Iago figure, played by Josh Hartnett) is jealous of Odin (the Othello figure, Mekhi Phifer) because Hugo's dad, the basketball coach (Martin Sheen) favors Odin and ignores his own son.Unfortunately, making the characters teenagers just points up the implausibility of the story. While you could say that the amount of bloodshed and death at the end of Shakespeare's play is also hard to believe, at least those characters are military men living in a violent and patriarchal culture. It's much less credible that a modern-day prep school student could be coaxed into killing his supposedly unfaithful girlfriend.Phifer has some good moments when he depicts Odin's anguish, but isn't able to convince us that his character would so quickly resort to murder. Julia Stiles, as girlfriend Desi, is mostly weak and whiny. Hartnett overuses his furrowed eyebrows and whisper-voice to signal Hugo's dark intentions--and while handsome, he lacks the diabolical charisma necessary for this role. Indeed, the movie makes him almost sympathetic, which is problematic because then Odin seems more like a villain, the stereotypical angry black kid. The worst things about O are its heavy-handed symbolism involving birds (hawks and doves) and its laughably bad dialogue. Its strings of clichés and swear words, supposedly representing teen-speak, would be irritating in any movie, but it feels even worse since we know that O was adapted from Shakespeare. When the movie tries to rewrite Shakespeare's memorable lines, it's even more painful. Iago's famous speech denouncing the idea of reputation becomes Hugo saying Reputation, who gives a f***? So, while it was a worthy idea to try to adapt the Othello story to a contemporary setting, I doubt that the reputations of the actors, director and screenwriter have been enhanced by their participation in O. "},{"Title":"Flawed but effective re-imagining of Othello","Date":"21 December 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller","Review":" Odin James (Mekhi Phifer) is the only black student at Palmetto Grove, a private school in the Deep South. He is the star of the basketball team, is dating Desi (Julia Stiles) daughter of the school's dean, and is loved by teachers, coaches, and students. All that is, except Hugo (Josh Hartnett), the insanely jealous son of the basketball coach (Martin Sheen). Enlisting the help of hopeless outcast Rodger (Elden Hanson) and his girlfriend Emily (Rain Phoenix), Hugo launches a convoluted scheme to destroy Odin's life, convincing him that Desi is cheating on him and also turning him against best friend Mike Cassio (Andrew Keegan). Odin's jealousy eventually gets the better of him, and a tragic conclusion becomes inevitable.Adapting Shakespeare for teens is a process that generally strikes me as intellectual masturbation or pompous self-importance. The themes of Shakespeare's plays are so universal and more importantly oft-copied that claiming descent from Shakespeare seems like a desperate attempt to add class to an otherwise typical film. Luhrman's Romeo+Juliet was a loud, flashy mess, redeemed only by its lead actors. Ten Things I Hate About You and She's the Man were disposable fun but more or less interchangeable with any number of other teen flicks, and in any case bearing only tertiary relation with their source material. I'm not impressed with She's the Man claiming descent from Twelfth Night because its basic story has been done five million times since.However, O stands above these films, despite a few notable flaws, namely the ending. Tim Blake Nelson adapts what is (in my opinion) Shakespeare's greatest tragedy Othello into a modern setting with surprising skill, keeping the spirit and themes of the play intact and even adding additional layers to it.Shakespeare's play is as much about the villainous Iago as it Othello. Despite his wickedness, Iago is a sympathetic character; he is clearly a tormented man with inner demons he doesn't know how to face. In this film, Hugo has additional motivation beyond merely being passed over for promotion (or acknowledgment as MVP). His father barely acknowledges his existence, while embracing Odin as the son I never had. As despicable as Hugo's actions are, it's easy to see what would drive him to such extremes.Also added is an exploration high school caste system. Usually dealt with in a truncated and comic fashion, it is devastatingly portrayed here. Rodger, Hugo's accomplice, is the son of one of the school's contributors, but also a geek who is beat up and picked on by pretty much everyone. There is a painful scene where Cassio torments him at a basketball game until he leaves. Hugo's alienation from his team mates is also a major factor, and it's easy to see why many people thought of Columbine when the film was released. People cast out by society are likely to their revenge, and this film shows that with devastating effect.Perhaps inevitably, the movie gives more weight to Odin's race than the source material did. The film features several sex scenes, including a disturbing one at mid-point where Odin's jealous begins to take hold in the middle of coitus - a scene that is both disturbing and effective. Odin is a model student, a great player, and liked by almost everyone in spite of his race, and yet as Hugo's scheme begins he begins reverting to stereotypes - he does drugs, is violent and moody, and at the end is driven to murderous rage. Odin is a victim as much of his own demons as Hugo, and the movie does an excellent job showing that.The biggest problem with the film is the end. Although abbreviated, the movie does a good job following the original text, and the film is perfectly paced. Until the climax. The decision to reduce the last two acts into a brief montage scene was a mistake, and ruined the pacing of the film. Odin's monologue at the end justifying his actions would have been more powerful if the movie hadn't just leaped into it.The cast is uniformly solid. Mekhi Phifer is powerful as Odin; his portrayal of Odin as a victim of his own insecurities is spot-on, and he is a thoroughly believable character throughout. Josh Hartnett, whom I've never rated as much of an actor, surprised me with a powerful performance as the treacherous Hugo. Julia Stiles' part as Desi is underwritten but Stiles cannot be faulted for that, and as always her performance is top-notch. Andrew Keegan, Rain Phoenix, and Elden Hanson also create memorable characters. Martin Sheen and John Heard are effective as the two most prominent adult cast members.Despite the ending, O is definitely the best of the teen adaptations of Shakespeare. The spirit of the original play is kept intact, and the characters are adapted well into a modern context. Definitely worth a look.7/10 "},{"Title":"brilliantly played out","Date":"25 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller","Review":" A superb movie showing humans with all key emotions in life love, jealously, betrayal, trust, and envy.As a beautifully crafted modernized version of Shakespeare's Othello this movie showcases the effects of jealously and suspicion in its truest form (although taken to a much higher level).

I guess when we can relate to it, then it would make more sense to us? I don't necessarily agree with that theory although it did work for this movie, it didn't work for the recently 20th century juxtaposition of Hamlet in which I believe Julia Stiles also starred as Ophelia. Pfeiffer is the star athlete of his high school basketball team, and the character of Othello (duh!) and Julia Stiles plays Desdemona with such rare decent vulnerability. A must see.

I had such high expectations given that it is based on the masterful Othello. I seldom feel that films are too short, but this one certainly is. The main problem is that the emotional roller-coaster that Odin experiences is not given enough time to develop. As a result, Odins change towards jealousy and rage feels a bit unrealistic. I would have liked more emphasis to be put on this part of the story so that the viewer understands more about Odin and his motives.However, on the upside, the film has some bright moments. Martin Sheen is always worth watching, Mekhi Phifer and Josh Hartnett deliver some inspiring work. The change of setting from the original play to the American south also works surprisingly well. This is worth a watch if you are a fan of modern Shakespeare adaptations, if you like to stick more to the original Shakespeare plays, you might find Al Pacino in The Merchant of Venice a more pleasant watch.

The movie is about high school students, but aside from a few stereotypes (the popular star athlete, the nerdy bitter kid, etc.) it has more substance than style. In that way, I found it to be a very ambitious film.  What it is trying to accomplish; a well-done Shakespeare update, is a weighty task.  It succeeds in some ways and fails in others, but overall is a movie worth seeing.Josh Hartnett turns in a good performance as Hugo, who is very jealous of the star basketball player preferred by his own father as well as the rest of the school's population, Odin (played well by Mekhi Phifer).  Hugo goes on to easily manipulate others on his way to destroying Odin's world altogether.  The ending is tragic and leaves no main character untouched as it all comes to a climax.The main flaws are the script itself and the length of the film.  Julia Stiles' character (Desi Brable, Odin's girlfriend) is not well-defined, nor is her and Odin's relationship.  We don't get an idea that these two would have such strong feelings for each other.  The movie could have done with more length in this area.  It runs at a paltry 90 minutes, a little extra time building the relationship between Odin and Desi, as well as showing more of Odin's close relationship with the coach (Hugo's father) wouldn't have hurt at all.  Especially considering those two relationships are the basis for the entire story.That said, given that Hugo's whole reason for flipping out like he does is jealousy, much of it over his father's preference for Odin over him, we don't see enough evidence of his father and Odin even having a close relationship to actually make this seem viable.  And when Hugo says later that much of his anger is over him not winning the team's MVP award, it seems ridiculous.  After all, Hugo doesn't come across as crazy, just disturbed and jealous.  And only a crazy person would want to screw up someone's life that badly over a stupid MVP award.The manipulations and the film's stunning conclusion are very well done; but unfortunately they lose weight because we aren't allowed to learn enough about the characters to care, and we don't see exactly why Hugo was so hell-bent on destroying Odin anyway.

First, the ten minute sex scene did seem a little over the top.  However, you can make an argument that it shows Odin's darker side.Second, I abhored the fact that Odin used drugs in this movie.  Hugo's drug use is understandable.  However, the use of drugs by the Othello character ruins one of the greatest themes in this movie.  After reading Shakespeare's play, one can't help but ask himself, Is Othello to blame, or was he simply a pawn in the hands of the evil mastermind?  By having Odin use drugs, it takes a small piece of the blame off Hugo, and it portrays Shakespeare's Othello as just a punk who's out of control, as opposed to a man overcome by jealousy, and destroyed by betrayal.In all however, I loved this movie.  I would recommend it to anyone with the mental capacity to understand Shakespeare, and I encourage all who didn't like this movie, to read the play and watch it again.  I give it a 9 out of 10.

All of the actors shine in this film, but Hartnett comes off as being undeniably cool and memorable.When you think about it though, the film gets very convoluted.  Since this is Shakespeare, we are not expected for the story elements to transcend into real life; unfortunately the film does try, and ultimately fails in making the story realistic.For example, Iago's (Hugo?) master plan seems only possible in a fictitious world, and the plan seems to rely too much on luck and the film's script for it to really work.  This is very distracting to the audience, cause you never buy a minute of it.The acting is superb though, and it is refreshing to see a teen movie pushed in a different direction for a change.Mild recommendation.

There's something delicious about an intelligent, witty and utterly heartless villain.  I've found myself more times than not applauding for the really cool villains, the handsome, quick and together ones who plot such evil acts more for the fun of manipulation than of any real cause.  Characters such as these deserve as slick a dramatic presentation as their words and deeds resonate. What I love best about Iago, as well as many of Shakespeare's characters, is the hawk-like way he would perch above all others on the scene and proclaim his insidious masterminding as an aside to himself or his audience, imaginary or not&#133;. `Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practising upon his peace and quiet even to madness'.Unfortunately, O is a poorly directed film and really wastes the talents of its actors, especially Josh Harnett, whose performance as it is maybe worth seeing the movie for but ultimately leaves you disappointed for what could have been. So boldly deeming itself a modern retelling of Othello, the director Tim Blake Nelson's work simply lacks the appropriate mood and style.  Othello and Iago are grand and mysterious characters and this movie needed darker elements like that of a thriller.  I kept hoping for an intriguing soundtrack to underscore the evil intentions being set into motion.  I kept hoping for at least one cool moment where Josh Harnett stares into the camera, donning a chilling smirk and declares his hatred.  Yet, what we get is rap music and lighting so bright with the vibrant colors you might find in Kiss Me Kate.  Not to mention, of course, the countless basketball sequences which all seem so staged and Martin Sheen wailing at the top of his lungs like his life is as stake. Plus, the old smashing of the backboard scene, which recalls the ferociousness of Jim Carrey's cable guy.  I think maybe this film's biggest flaw is it's bowdlerizing of a famous Shakespearean work.  The movie's true agenda is pointing out how few values are youth have today allowing themselves to be engulfed in one sinful temptation after another. All of its contemporary notions of high school competitiveness, drug use and racial tensions alone could have inspired a powerful film.  However, using Shakespeare as its calling card, this film is without poetry and dramatic flair and is undeserving to even be called an adaptation.

Is this an explanation for her success? Do  teenyboppers feel they have to respect her good posture and firm, crisp voice? Is she the pint-sized Joan Allen? As the Desdemona in this poorly thought-through update of OTHELLO, she seems to have done a ton of really hard homework for every beat of every scene. Mekhi Phifer, playing O, the movie's contemporary variant on Othello (a high-school basketball star), seems puzzled by her--and not just because his character is drawn as a none-too-bright fountain of eternal earnestness. Phifer is all sweet smiles and transparency; Stiles is like a musty hardcover book slamming shut in your face. From the get-go, you want to fast-forward to the tragic conclusion.  The surprise here is that Josh Hartnett, who elsewhere seems like a pretty boy phoning it in, gives a steely, respectable performance as Hugo, the movie's Iago. There's a ton of moronic xplanation given for Hugo's seemingly baseless evil (including my favorite contrivance he's a cocaine and steroid freak!) but it's Hartnett's still-waters-run-deep silence that makes it work. A strange mixture of beauty, no-nonsense and quiet longing, Hartnett here seems like a movie star--or at least a bright latter-day variant on Jan-Michael Vincent. The movie pulls it together in the last five minutes...but then, the playwright did a pretty good job with those five minutes. O, so sure not to offend in its description of the place of race in teen culture, winds up offending in its special pleading for the O character--did he have to be so pure of heart? When O smashes a glass backboard in a free-throw contest, the movie dabbles unpleasantly with the black-man-as-untamed-beast iconography of yesteryear. Maybe if the movie had brazenly broken taboos in the James Toback tradition, the filmmakers could have gotten somewhere. As is, the movie is like a self-serious version of CRUEL INTENTIONS; and the director, Tim Blake Nelson, seems never to know the right place to put the camera.

More importantly, within the context of present day school violence, this film reminds us that there are real people behind such tragedies.

High school, a source of much drama and angst seems like the perfect place to set a story about mistrust and jealousy and gossip.  The writer also sets the tale in the world of high school basketball.  This works well for the story too.  Things that wouldn't seem important to most people become incredibly important to high school jocks suspensions, MVP trophies, etc.The violence is another thing altogether.  The story must be violent if it is to follow the path of Shakespeare.  Does the director convince us that these teenagers are capable of such violence?  He does.  Too easily.  All of the violence in the story is easily believed. O has a few problems, though.  A) The acting is not really that great, with the exception of Mekhi Phifer and Josh Hartnett.  Martin Sheen's performance is downright laughable.  B) Some of the high school type drama is mostly laughable as well. The rest of it works, in my opinion.  The relationship between Duke and Hugo becomes one of real interest.  The relationships between the boys are especially interesting.  Tim Blake Nelson does an excellent job of exploring the Upper class white family and the detachment that exists there.  The teenagers at this prep school have too much money and too little parental involvement.  The director also continually reminds us of O's race, with startling results.  Phifer's Odin is the only Black student in the school. Race is an issue, and Nelson makes it one. The driving force in the movie is Josh Hartnett's Hugo character, though. Why does he do what he does?  He never tells.If you can stomach all of the high school angst, O is worth seeing for what it says about the White middle class youth.

One could cite also CRUEL INTENTIONS in _Dangerous Liaisons_, the horrible people are aging grownups; retelling the story with teens suggests that contemporary US teens can be-or are-as nasty as corrupt French aristocrats of the bad old days just before the French Revolution. 	I've suggested and am looking for a student or two to do a literature search and write up for publication the thesis that Antony Burgess's full, 21-chapter _A Clockwork Orange_ is a kid-bashing book in its concluding, non-sequitur assertion that ultraviolence and such = just a stage boys go through and outgrow.  (As Males notes, guys don't outgrow violence so much as take it indoors; in any event, the adults in the first 20 chapters of _Orange_ have not aged out of ultra-nastiness.)OTHELLO VS. _O_ 	In Shakespeare's _Othello_, Othello is significantly older than Desdemona, and this is one of the reasons he concludes that she is cheating on him.  In America of the 1980s and 1990s, one popular idea had oversexed teenage boys knocking up promiscuous teenage girls for an epidemic of teen pregnancy.  That was not the reality.  In terms of the statistics Males presents, at least half of the raging hormones involved in teenage pregnancy belonged to men in their 20's and older.   	A realistic,  modernized _Othello_ would have an 18-year old Desdemona hooking up with an Other man who was Black, important, noble, and at least in his late 20s (maybe a younger, darker, Collin-Powell figure). 	_O_ AND THE GENERATIONAL BATTLE 	Setting _O_ in a prep-school/high school is additional evidence for what at least two over-30 film producers have noted as the dominance of relative youngsters as the consumers and makers of recent movies.   That far it is a legitimate example of Kid Power.  _O_ is also an esthetically respectable look at kids both good and pathological, well-written and directed, and very well acted by its young stars.   	At the same time, _O_ functions in its cultural context as anti-kid propaganda.   	If you know _Othello_ well, _O_ can say, truthfully, Kids can be as messed up as grownups.  Most film-goers hardly know _Othello_ at all, and part of the message of _O_ for them will be that US kids are screwed up drug-abusing punks, with some psychos loose among the boys, and deceiving victims among the girls.   	In Odin James in _O_ do we have the noble Moor whom the full Senate of the United States could Call all in all sufficient?  No, we don't.  Nor in Desi Brable do we have the poetic force and ideological significance of Desdemona's perfect love.

Either it is a story that gets new twists or new action (the upcoming The Musketeer), or it has been put into a modern setting. O is of the latter type of story--yet it is as effective set in the modern era as it is set in days of old. Based on Othello by William Shakespeare, this tale of emotions driven to their breaking point has been masterfully directed by Tim Blake Nelson. There could have been many ways for him to tell this story; it could have spiraled down to a typical teen movie (i.e., cool characters who say smart and sassy things, or the love story proves triumphant), or it could have been turned into an extremely violent tale, which would fade into the background of American cinema as just yet another bloody fable and something for which parents might blame real-life tragedy (which, sadly, might be the case with this film). The R rating is well deserved--there is rough language and violence, including one disturbing image of a self-inflicted gunshot and a romantic night gone wrong. Yet, when viewed in context of the movie, it's a wonder that director Nelson didn't choose to show anything more graphic than necessary. There were many points where he was given the opportunity, and the violence that is in the film is definitely severe, but he didn't go that route. Instead, he focused more on the story and the characters, which I greatly appreciated. This film was apparently the target of a lot of controversy over its supposed Columbine-esque violence; however, this is more of a calculated, focused rage that has its place in the story. This is not carried out by kids who saw this as the ultimate revenge against bullies--it is overprivileged children who see that whatever they want in the world, they should have. These killings are not the random, point and let the bullets fly kind; each has its own meaning and purpose, however sad it may be.(NOTE I'm not belittling the tragedy that was Columbine. Violence of any kind has no place in our schools.)It's hard to try to put Othello into a modern setting, much less a high school setting, where you're just finding out who you are and what you're capable of. The characters are extremely adult, yet childish with their selfish wants and actions. The actors give terrifically brooding and often scary portrayals of their characters. As the boy who is driven mad with jealousy, Mekhi Pfifer (as Odin, or O) draws you in and makes you see the wheels spinning in his head and what they're doing to him. Josh Hartnett gives a chilling performance as Hugo, a kid devoid of emotion and conscience. And as the innocent, Julia Stiles gives her character a soulful depth and strength that few actresses could have possibly brought to this role. Finally, Martin Sheen is perfect as the coach of the basketball team who is constantly overlooking his son, Hugo, in favor of the bright star that is Odin. The update itself is stunning. As far as technical aspects, the cinematography really draws you in to the characters and their surroundings, as good films should. Also, the screenwriting made sense for today's audiences. The predicaments these kids are put in, sadly, wouldn't seem out of the ordinary in this day and age. No matter who you are, you can identify with being alienated by your parents, or perhaps wanting the girl you could never have, or trying your best and getting spit on instead.The outcomes and actions these kids take, however, are purely Shakespearean, which may not make it seem as realistic as you would want it to be. But this is a Shakespearean tragedy, which means that, of course, there will be no happy ending. Tim Blake Nelson and company had been given the daunting task to bring this story to a modern audience. Hats off to them for succeeding beautifully.

Odin's scarf replaces Othello's handkerchief. Yep, it plays out well with this modern version, serving as the visual reminder to the viewers that blindness can be the outcome of passion... symbolizing Desi's love, her alleged betrayal, Odin's so-called evidence of her dishonesty and his final reference to the truth. Yo, watching Josh Harnett's Hugo battle against Odin and Michael is enough to make me cringe.  Watch his eyes; listen to his invented misrepresentations.  Harnett has well portrayed himself as a character who is as complex and ambiguous as his motives! But Mekhi Phifer's Odin lacks the boldness, charisma and eloquence expected of Shakespeare's Othello.  He's simply not too convincing in expressing his grief and fury at Desi's alleged infidelity.  While Julia Stile's Desi advocates a strong and charming personality, her performance lacks the persuasion of warranting Odin's jealousy, hatred and anger.  Martin Sheen fits his `coach' role but his actions throughout the movie are too predictable.  And the gangsta-rap music?  Like the pigeons (does the writer really need to adopt Shakespeare's bird image?), it creates a disruptive effect on the changing mood of the characters. Verde's Othello would have been more appropriate to sustain the audience's suspense.  Overall, this is an interesting film.  It has not failed to muster up the thought that the devil exists amongst the characters, tempting them to sin and punishing them for their sins. Powerful! And it subtly conjures up racial consciousness with a black Odin in a high school with an all white student body.  The core of the characters' dialogue certainly singles out the stereotypical misconceptions and lies about Odin's heritage.  A compelling timeless drama! And it held my fascination.

The film pulls no punches in its treatment of race or portrayal of sex and sexuality and refrains from taking any sort of position or stance on the jealousy, rage, and violence that frame and move the story.  Before the film was even over, I found myself wishing, praying even, that parents would see this film--this way, they could actually talk to their kids, and even their kid's friends, about the complex and compelling issues O touches.The film is extremely intense many characters are filled with deep anger, or other emotions, such as distrust, fear, and envy, which are potrayed in extremes by the director and actors.  It's not necessarily a bad thing, but rather a very important thing to know about the film.The cast is very strong and contains quite a few faces teen audiences will not only know but be able to relate to Mekhi Pfieffer as the lead, Odin, or O, Julia Stiles as Desi, his paramour; and Josh Hartnett as Hugo, the malevolent mastermind behind whose jealousy drives the tragedy.  If anything, the actors are too good Hartnett's evocative performance is sure to set off debate on whether and how O might contribute to acts of teen violence, similar to Columbine.  I think the potential value in the work is that it allows audiences to see, and potentially discuss, the relationships between gender, violence, and perceptions of power and how these elements relate to, influence, and are influenced by high school violence.It would be a shame to dismiss O as being too violent, or as too dangerous because it may lead to copy-cat crimes--if screened and effectively discussed, O can potentially be a great tool in understanding our students' real experiences. It would be a shame to dismiss O as being a fluffy teen pic, because it's certainly not that either.  It would be a shame to dismiss O as being just a bad adaption of a Shakespeare classic--Tim Blake Nelson and an excellent ensemble of young actors bring timeless material alive in a fresh, bold way.Mekhi Pfieffer anchors the cast with a truly phenomenal performance.  His star should shine brightly as a result of his passionate, compelling work here.  Hartnett, as stated before, is also outstanding.  Both men should be extremely proud of their work in this film.

He is about to lead his team through the play-offs, and he has recently won the love of a dean's daughter, Desi.  However, the coach's angry son Hugo is also on the team.  Neglected by his father and overshadowed by Odin, Hugo forms a vicious plan, resulting in a bloody and all too familiar disaster.The filmmakers pull no punches and opt for a fairly straight adaptation, doing an admirable job of staying true to the Shakespeare's plot and characters while avoiding his language in favor of an entirely original script. Though rap music, guns, drugs, cars, and the basketball court do figure into the story, these modern trappings never overshadow the human drama. Director Tim Blake Nelson lets his camera tell the story in a refreshingly simple manner, refusing the typical gimmickry of modern cinema; and a very solid cast carries the story well. Josh Hartnett as Hugo is perhaps the most outstanding--his angsty Ivy League face, reminiscent of Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, always captures the bitter essence of his character.Though the film was completed in 1998, the release of 0 was repeatedly delayed due to the rash of high school shootings in the late 1990s. While it is understandable that such incidents of youth violence should make film studios cautious, this is one film which stands apart with a mature and timeless message about hate and the seeds of tragedy.

In this case, the actors don't look foolish, quoting Shakesperean dialogue in a modern setting.  In O the dialogue is completely modernized, but the characters and plot of Othello still remain intact, updated to a high school setting.  Of course, Mekhi Pfieffer and Josh Hartnett look way too old for high school students, but this film is so wonderfully done that I was able to overlook that flaw.Tim Blake Nelson (who some may remember from the Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou) did an excellent job at directing, avoiding all teen movie cliches.  Along with Ghost World I would hate for this film to classified in the same genre as teen fluff flicks like Drive Me Crazy and She's All That.  There's no gross-out sight gags or Dawson's Creek melodrama. The acting is excellent.  Underrated actor Mekhi Pfieffer is perfect in the title role, delivering an extraordinarily powerful performance.  Julia Stiles is also great--and insanely beautiful, as always--as his lover Desi.  Josh Hartnett is perfectly cast as Hugo, a modern version of the conniving Iago character in Shakespeare's play.  Unlike some shallow teen actors, I think Hartnett has a good career ahead of him and is more than just another Hollywood pretty boy.  It's nice to see his career flourish with hits like Black Hawk Down.  Anthony A.J. Johnson shows he can pull off a serious role quite well.  John Heard is great as Desi's father and Martin Sheen is a scene-stealer as the loudmouthed basketball coach/father of Hugo. The soundtrack is wonderful, contrasting beautiful Operatic Arias (with the help of Elizabethan instruments) with modern day rap music.  The film contains certain themes, commonly used in edgy high school dramas  drug use, violence.  But these themes are never presented in a heavy-handed fashion, never overshadowing its main themes of jealousy, greed and envy.

In the original play, Othello was a general. The Odin of the film is a high school basketball star. In today's society, it may not seem incredible to consider school athletics of earth-shattering importance, but to me it's a bit  of a stretch. No one in O has any sense of perspective, the notion that maybe basketball isn't the most important thing in the world. This is made worse by Martin Sheen as the sterotypically fanatical coach.    The racial element of O doesn't work either, and I'm sure some black viewers were offended by the ease with which the psychotically envious Hugo fools the naive Odin. To me Hugo seemed like a surly underachiever, not likely to have the intelligence or ambition to pull off such elaborate schemes. Speaking of which, the plot of O is overly complex. The way Hugo plots Odin's downfall is simply too elaborate and makes us aware that the script is trying too hard to fit a model (the original Othello).   Finally, the film collapses completely during the final fifteen mintutes. Apparently, O was delayed due to the events at Columbine. They needn't have worried, as the violence at the conclusion of O is so overblown it seems amateurish. I seriously doubt if this film has the power to motivate real-life violence (at least one thing in its favor). At the very end, Odin gives a speech that sounds like a monologue in a drama class. Then we're subjected to opera in the background and further portentous musings on the part of Hugo.

The score drives with a modern beat, using operatic tones just enough.The performances are universally excellent. Even modest roles are well cast with people that really can act. My only complaint here is that Martin Sheen as the coach/father is so strong as always that he almost overtakes the story. But not quite.

I'm always interested to see how Shakespeare can be modernized. Sometimes it works(10 Things I Hate About You=The Taming of the Shrew and 96 version of Romeo and Juliet)While others aren't so great(Get Over It=A Midsummers Nights Dream). In both cases it's still really exciting to see how they bring the essence of shakespeare to the screen. In my opinion when you modernize the language, the setting, and the characters it presents more of a challenge to make it truly work.So when i heard more about O and its cast i knew i just had to see this movie. I heard about its release date and i was all ready to go see it. However, due to the tragedy at Columbine the films release date was changed due to controversial themes in the movie that related too closely to the tragedy. This peaked my interest in the film even more because i love to see films with strong subject matter because it shows that the filmmaker wnats to hold nothing back and films that are more realistic in that aspect always work better for me.However Miramax could never give O a solid release date. It would be set for release and changed and so on and so forth. In the end O received about 7 different release dates. Finally a studio named Lions Gate picked the film up and gave it a Aug.31, 2001 release date. A whole 2 years after the initial release date. Now it was my time to see it and i'm happy to say i was not disappointed.This update is by far the best modernized retelling of shakespeare ever made. It stayed true to the essence of othello while adding a few little modern twist to the story. To update it for highschool certain things had to be changed for it to fit with story. First there are name changes Othello is now Odin James(O.J., did anyone else get that), Desimonda is now Desi and Iago is now Hugo. Also instead of being a member in high society, O is the msot popular person at his school(The only black student) and a star basketball player. He's dating the most popular girl in school and all these things are what fuel Hugo's jealously. Soon he slowy begins to manipulate all involved in the story untill his plans lead to a pretty tragic conclusion.What i like about the play and this version or lets jsut say this story in general is the way certain things are presented. Everyone has been jealous of someone at some point in there lives so in that aspect you can relate with the villian of the story. I did at some points. Now, don't get me wrong this guy is pretty ruthless but when you look at how he's treated by his dad, who is also his basketball coach, you begin to see what fuels his rage. He's frustrated because he feels he has a right to shine. There are several references to the Hawk in the film. Odin is a hawk because he soars above everyone else and everyone pays attention to him. He's not like everyone else thus he can't fit in with normal birds. Hugo wants to be like this an d he feels that it's his due time to soar above everyone else. I also like how it shows how easily people can be manipulated. Manipulation can truly twist someone's mind up and in this case it truly does.There are many scenes int he film that i felt worked very well in the film and these scenes stand out in my mind as the best in the film. The first one is the slam dunk contest. I coul honestly feel his rage at that point and the instrumental score in that scence was truly magnificent. The next scene is the first confrontation between desi and Odin over the scarf he gave her. the performers are so intense during this scene that it just really pulled me in. Lastly is the last 15 or 20 minutes are truly intense. The things that take place during this time frame really got to me and that's how i knew i was seeing a  good movie. It gave me that feeling in my stomach and the realism that the last 15 minutes or so presents is gripping.The ActingBy far the best aspect of this film is the acting by all involved. Every performer gives a compelling performance.Mekhi Phifer(Odin) he gives a powerful performance. He really captured all the various modes of the character. He played the sensitivity and exuberrance of the character well in the beginning of the film but when the rage and frustration of Odin begins to show this is when Mekhi is in top form. A blistering performance that could very well be the best of his career.Julia Stiles(Desi) Julia Stiles is officially the spokeswoman for william shakespeare. This i her third shakespeare update after 10 things I hate about you and Hamlet. Once again she's proving that she is one of th best actresses of her generation. She conveys the strength but also the innocence of Desi really well. She's a very capable performer and her chemistry with Mekhi Phifer is what makes certain events in the film work.Josh Hartnet(Hugo) I'm a sucker for peopel that paly villains. it jsut seems like an awesome role to play because it cna truly show your range as an actor and Josh hartnet does an admirable job. Nto only through his lines but his manuerisms. He's truly menancing in some scenes but he also has to make you understand his plight. why he's jealous, and why he does what he does. Josh Hartnett is able to pull us into his world and show us why he's so angry. This is by far the best performance of his career.Andrew Keegan(Michael) I don't understand why he's left out of most of the promotion for this film. his character plays an important role in these proceedings. Nonetheless he plays the role of the impressionable teenager quite well. I hope to see him in more roles like this that challenge his range.Rain Phoenix(Emily) i have nothing to compare her performance to but she is quite good in this film. She hits all the right notes and she is really good in the last few scenes of the film. Hope to see her in more movies.Martin Sheen(Coach Goulding) Martin Sheen gives an intense performance as the basketball coach and father of hugo. Some may think he's a little over the top but since i know coaches like this i think he hits all the right notes.Elden HensonSorry i forgot his characters name but he's also very good in the film. He plays the insecure, nerd role pretty well and his character is also very important in the films proceedings.ConclusionAs you cna see i really enjoyed this film and i encourage everyoen to go see it. This film doesn't encourage violents inf act as a 16 year old boy woh is currently in highschool it showed me that actions like this jsut aren't worth it. i tihnk there is a lesson to be learned while you're viewing this film. just go in with an open mind and i'm sure you'll enjoy it.

Mekhi Phifer heartbreaking Odin exemplified great acting i cannot wait to see him in more movies this guy has the makings of a huge star. His character Odin's moving fall from grace due to his `tragic flaw,' jealousy, is one of the better i have seen even on stage. Julia Stiles once again demonstrates her longevity as one of the foremost actresses under the age of 30 not just because i am bias as she is one of my favorite actresses. Her interpretation of Desi as not just the girlfriend of this guy but as his `better half' (and without her he cannot live) was the most believable teenage relationship i have ever seen on screen. Julia's Desi brought out Desdemona's playful side and she is seen as more than just a woman as Shakespeare intended. A little surprise in this movie was Rain Phoenix (one of the many siblings of the late but great River Phoenix and Gladiator star Joaquin Phoenix you remember him he was the king guy) as Desi's best friend, Emily and Hugo's girlfriend i did not expect her bring anything to the often drab role of Emilia but it looks like the Phoenix genes still rein (no pun intended) in Rain at the movies. I have neither the time nor the space to comment on everyone's performance but i was impressed by them all. Nothing i have ever seen them do.Now for the script and themes Familiarity with the play is not a necessity but helps in that you are not as put through the ringer in the end. I was shocked at the caliber of the script, although, not award winning, it was not stupefied up for the viewing audience. The guy who wrote the screen play tried to be as real as he could (and did not puss out like some movies we have see his year cough cough Crazy/Beautiful cough cough) being careful to demonstrate the fact that not everyone lives happily ever after and that there is always someone just around the corner that will go to the extreme to get what they want. I did miss the Shakespearean dialogue and the puzzled look on people's faces when watching (it is truly the best part of Shakespeare re-makes). The themes; jealousy is bad, (umm Kay) proves true and always will, one can never underestimate the power of envy, which also proves true, like life, trust is a fragile and volatile thing, and in a effort not to sound like an after school special be careful with matters of the heart oh yeah and school sucks no matter how wealthy you are.Over all with the rash of crappy teen movies based on Shakespeare and classics cough get over it cough i expected a crappy teen movie and i got much more. I will put this next to my classics right next to its predecessor, Othello (made in 1996), starring Lawrence Fishborne. So if you are 17 and you want to see a well done drama this is a not to miss but if you are not they are checking ID, rabidly. Why you ask? Long story...

This latter-day Othello the Moor is an isolated Hawk in the mostly lily-white Venice of Charleston, NC (he is admired by everyone as a BB Court general and warrior).   This title character cannot truly be understood as an OJ-stand-in whose marital abuse of his white trophy paramour has generally been acknowledged as the key to both her murder and that of a bystander, Ron Goldman.  We're dealing here with a classic play and not social commentary about that unsolved murder! The screenwriter and director of O took some edgy chances but in my opinion, this was hardly the film to hold back from theaters and video distribution in 1998/1999.  Dare I remind anyone of two teen-flicks with a lot more Columbine H.S. shootings' haunting/prefiguring moments   THE BASKETBALL DIARIES and HEATHERS.            The plot of O literally hangs in the balance over the believability of the passion shared by the lead actor and actress. That on-screen chemistry works rather effectively in my opinion.  They're no Academy Award shoo-ins but still do well with their acting.  The actor who carries the IAGO part is given too much of the storyline but some of the modernization has to be believable as to motive and scheme.   As I have expressed in other IMDB.com reviews (see SNAKE EYES), however, if I had a vote on the MPAA board, this provocative film would have gotten an NC-17 rating.  Unless ticket buyers have parental accompaniment and full permission to take in this disturbing portrayal of youth violence and sexuality, too many bad behaviors are lifted up as being ramification-free and part of growing up.  My recommendation of this film comes with a condition that the attracted teen audience for this kind of tragic tale consider whether championship BB players do win it all and have no limits on their behavior!  If we asked for reality checks on High School Senior sports stars, such hard-working students could see the hard-to-believe parts of the film's plot for what they are  silly exaggeration.  As Shakespeare knew from killing off so many characters in HAMLET & ROMEO AND JULIET, young people are suicidal and extremist at all the wrong moments; they are also vengeful and short-sighted; they are hyper-sexual and oblivious to consequences of casual sex; they can mouth profanities and politically-incorrect racial epithets to ape adults with such limited vocabularies.  Don't become the people in this movie -- especially the coach who regards winning as the only thing -- learn from their tragic endings and wasted potentials and fly to heights that come with plenty of safety nets!

The setting of a preppy high school basketball team allows the movie-makers to comment on teen violence, sports mania, and drugs as catalysts for obsessive victory and senseless school shootings.The hawk and doves pick up from Shakespearian imagery and translate well into a school setting. Like a twisting spiral staircase, the trap of deceit and jealously is built. The cast is strong and has good chemistry, even allowing some humor as a tragic foil. Instead of blank verse, we get updated paraphrases spoken in whispers that emphasize the sense of darkness within the human soul.Ironically, the film's release date was delayed numerous times because of American school violence. But instead of glorifying guns and shootings, the film takes us deep inside the motivation of people who resort to tragic means for solving their problems. Pride and the desire for attention are the classic tragic flaws we see played out here. There may even be a grim bit of sarcasm in the name of the teen Othello -- Odin Jones (O.J.).I think this is a worthy, and I recommend it.

But unlike Baz Luhrmann with his dazzling 'Romeo + Juliet', director Tim Blake Nelson has not dared to retain Shakespeare's language. But it's the language that is the main appeal of the works listening to the contemporary high-school dialogue of this film, with it's incessant swearing (Shakespeare, of course, was himself often rude) and utter lack of wit (something which the bard could never be accused of), something's definitely missing. What's not missing is the plot, but again, the film lacks Luhrnann's ingenious touches, and the problem here is that fundamentally, most of Shakespeare's plots were pretty ridiculous, and also curtailed to fit a theatrical performance. So we're introduced to the lead character, supposedly from the wrong side of the tracks but already living a life of privilege because we haven't seem him fight his way up, we have no particular reason to care for him. While those out to get him do so from motives of unambiguous jealousy, there's no attempt to get the audience to share their motivations. While the plan they contrive to bring the hero down is contorted in the extreme, and fails to work in the contemporary environment it's based on the idea that, if you could trick someone into believing that their girlfriend was unfaithful, they would respond by killing her, and that such a death would be acceptable collateral damage in your eyes if thereby you could destroy him. Without a more convincing portrait of mental disintegration on the part of O himself, this doesn't hold up; and the villain also fails to convince as someone who could hatch such a dastardly scheme. Swearing aside, it's a very mild story until suddenly people start dying it seems inconceivable that such a plot would have been written from scratch had it not already existed.The acting is OK but not brilliant Julia Stiles stands out, but more for the fact that her facial features seem to fit exactly the current Hollywood definition of teenage beauty. And one is left (as a Brition) pondering the strange world of American educational establishments which run what are almost professional sports teams. But there's not too much else that engages the mind; and the racial dimension is, surprisingly for what might seem to be the most topical of the play's themes, almost ignored throughout most of the film.

The tale closely follows Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), who is the lone African-American student that attends a well-known prep school and the most popular student after earning MVP honors in boys' basketball, is slowly urged by Hugo (Josh Hartnett), the coach's lowly son into understanding that Odin's girlfriend, Desi (Julia Stiles), the dean's lovely daughter is cheating on him.I hate to think that the story does a by-the-numbers routine, which actor/director Tim Blake Nelson and his screenwriter, Brad Kaaya carefully avoids.  The positive side is Nelson appears to know how to handle every scene very delicately.And the events that occur during the movie aren't absolutely shocking, just eerie and the tension is boiling.  The surprises that pop-up are well-placed and doesn't miss a single beat.Phifer is good here in handling the emotions of his character while Stiles is also excellent here.  And Hartnett, he's seems to be new at being the dishonest and double-crossing friend and he doesn't play it like Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, or Gary Oldman would handle it.  Hartnett simply adapts to the character quite well, which is good for the movie and shows that he can play someone who is deceiving.The trio is backed up by an impressive supporting cast (Martin Sheen, John Heard, Rain Phoenix, Elden Hensen, and Andrew Keegan).  Out of the bunch, Sheen emerges from the pack and he certainly makes his presence felt very early as the coach.  Sheen's performance here isn't completely identical to the one he gave in David Cronenberg's chilling version of Stephen King's The Dead Zone as the off-the-wall third party candidate.Before I end this review, I can't help to think why O has been of the few films that was targeted because it stirs up those god-awful images of what happened at Columbine a few years ago.  I find it appalling that some people (ones who didn't lose any loved ones there) still make a big fuss over the issue and don't let it go away.  I remember that day all too well, watching the horror unfold on t.v., and it was a sight that no one ever wants to see.  The message that O tries to show that violence isn't the answer to solving a private issue and it works very well.

He is motivated mostly by his father's indifference, but a lot of his actions are left ambiguous. He hates and loves Odin, instead of just hating him. The last lines are about him. The story is told mostly from Hugo's oint of view, and compared to the original, Othello is insecure and not very noble.

Using Odin's girlfriend as the lynch-pin in his plan, Hugo manoeuvres other pupils into position before sowing the seeds of doubt about his relationship with Odin. With Hugo's words eating away at him personally and on the court, Odin starts to show the outward signs of the pressure on him as Hugo continues to play the game from the inside using others.It is easy to be protective of Shakespeare and automatically dismiss any updating &#150; particularly where the dialogue is shunned and the target audience is a teenage one, however I was determined to give O a chance because if nothing else, at least it wasn't a comedy. The narrative is simplified at the same time as being updated and as a result the characters are not as complex as the ultimate conclusion needs them to be. This results in a mostly good flow as the pieces are moved into position by the manipulative Hugo but too sudden a jump into murder and betrayal without the depth behind it to make it convincing. By being pretty superficial in regards the characters, it asks too much of us to buy into the students killing one another over cheating and ruined friendships.The end of the film is quite strong though and I can understand why it sat waiting for someone to release it but it was not enough for me because I simply didn't believe the characters would go to such extremes on the basis of what I had seen. The actors try their best but without the material to support their directions they cannot do enough to carry it. Hartnett is the lead but his performance lacks grounding; spurned for MVP is not enough motivation to start him and he does not have the desire and cunning of the better Iago's. Conversely he is a bit too flat and lacking a rage that pushes against his cold logic to drive him to his fall. Phifer is better as he wears his fall better, bringing out a convincing confusion in his actions even if again the extremity of his actions are not totally founded in his character. Stiles is OK but very much a device in the film as much as in the narrative and she doesn't have a lot to do in a film that is about the two male leads. Sheen adds star value but is restricted to an obvious coach caricature while the support cast are mostly just the standard high school types.Overall then, an OK modern version in regards the basic narrative flow, however the lack of depth and complexity in the characters prevents it being as convincing as it really should have been. The cast try to work with what they have but at the end of the day, like them, I found myself wishing that more work had gone in early in the writing process.

This movie, O, updates the story to a 21st century high school in Charleston, SC.

The story is the same, one of jealousy and how it can destroy one's sanity and one's life.Mekhi Phifer has the starring role as Odin James, accomplished athlete lured to this high school to help win the state basketball championship. He is the only black in the school. Josh Hartnett is Odin's close friend Hugo, son of coach Goulding (Martin Sheen), and also a starter on the basketball team. Andrew Keegan is Michael Cassio, another of the starters. The tension begins when during a school assembly coach Goulding presents O the MVP award, but O calls up Cassio, publicly announcing him as his right hand man, an equal MVP contributor. Coach then hugs O and states that he loves him just like a son. All of this makes Hugo jealous, Hugo of many basketball talents and the coach's son, so he begins his plot to take revenge. Julia Stiles is the young, pretty and lily-white Desi, who has secretly been O's girlfriend for 4 months. Hugo is also jealous over that. Rain Phoenix is Emily, Desi's room mate. The choices of music are interesting and add to the flavor of the story. It is a mix of classical and street rap, and punctuate the story lines very well. MAJOR SPOILERS. It will be no surprise to anyone who knows Othello well, but Hugo hatches a plot to convince O (falsely) that his girl Desi is sleeping with his buddy Cassio, such that when everything is done both Cassio and Desi will be dead, and O will be banished to jail. The plan matches the story in Othello very closely. Things don't go quite as planned, but O does sneak into Desi's room and overtaken with jealously chokes Desi and kills her on her bed. By this time nearly insane with grief, O wanders out onto the porch of the dorm and, with police holding guns on him, he shoots and kills himself.

You don't see Hugo with very many people, either, but I guess you have to presume that 'everyone likes Hugo' but maybe Hugo doesn't realize that.  Dad does not like Hugo; at least, he doesn't like him the most.  This seems to be the major bug up Hugo, and it would have been easier for him if he just bad-mouthed O to Dad and gotten him taken off the team someway, but he first tries to get O charged with forcing himself on Desi, and when that does not work, he gets Roger to start a fight with Michael, thus getting Michael kicked off the team.  Hugo plans to get Michael back on the team by going through Desi - if Michael tries to convince Desi to get O to talk to Coach, perhaps he will be allowed back on the team.   Hugo is convinced that Michael must hang out with Desi a lot in order to achieve his goal. In the meantime, Hugo is feeding O a lot of nonsense about Michael and Desi's friendship taking a new, closer aspect, and O gets jealous fairly quickly.  This is where it all really starts, but Hugo keeps teaming one side against the other so that everyone will get all worked up over one thing or another.  This is also where my problems with the movie kicked in - if Michael and O had just one conversation, and compared notes on what Hugo was saying to each of them, they would have figured him out, and we'd be without this movie. Its totally illogical, especially since both guys are friends, possibly more so because of their mutual fondness for Desi. You just have to believe Hugo is that convincing, that O and Michael are unable to talk and solve anything, and that Desi is unable to arbitrate their differences.  Suffice to say, it does not end well for anyone.  Hugo's final plan has flaws a mile wide and more people get hurt than he and O originally plan.   It seems like a stupid reason for violence, but I guess that might be the point - that there is never really a good reason..Hartnett is completely convincing.  His eyes darkened, he looks like a POW, and it works, cause he is in some ways.  He does not fall victim to any of the 'psycho' trappings of the character and overdo any of it.  Mekhi is less successful, especially in some of his speeches, but I can't imagine anyone else in his part.  Keegan does not get to make much of an impression, since he's aboard just to make the plot move along.  He's a device and plays it that way.  Stiles is good but seems to lack the fire she displayed in '10 Things I Hate About You'.  Her love scenes with Mekhi are when the both of them are at their best.  I enjoyed Henson in 'The Mighty' but his character here is extremely sketchy at best.  As mentioned, I could 'solve' this movie with a couple of moves.  I will probably see it again since I do like it.  Just don't think its that good.  5/10.

Therefore I cannot compare the film with Othello and will judge the film as a separate unit.  The story, of course, has a lot of material to work from but somehow I feel that all the characters were set without reason or background.  Like we came at a story half way through, seeing how it all ended.  There were surprisingly few well laid out, challenging conversation, and all motives or drivers behind any actions very unreal or vague.  To top it, I was unsure as to what sort of a film it was meant to be.  A love story, a thriller, action or what ever.  There is simply not enough focus on any one part of the story to get you interested in the dreams and lives of one or more characters.   The actors did OK as such, nothing remarkably good or bad.  I think one of the downfall was the lack of suspense and/or speed.

I wonder if the key scribe on this new and improved Othello, Brad Kaaya, read the play before he hacked it to pieces, or simply opted for the Cliff's Notes version?  Because the film moves in a similar hackneyed way, fast slow, fast slow, throwing major plot points into a jumbled mix with slow drawn out dramatic scenes.As for the direction and the acting, it seems to be very strong at times while hesitant at others.  Certainly the actors seem to know what they're saying, seem to be well acquainted with their motivation, they even convey their anger/lust/jealousy with remarkable depth and skill.  Yet the storyline betrays them, as their motives are never made blunt, never fully explained, and leave the viewer in a quandary as to their well acted (but half baked) antics.On a final note the soundtrack was superbly selected with a strange mixture of Hip-Hop, Rap, and soulful R&B, but even this became perverted by the inclusion of an aria during the aftermath of the climatic moment.  Opera had no place in this modern movie and seemed pretentious and ill-advised-not unlike the casting of Rain Phoenix as Emily. Phoenix spent the better part of the film looking sullen and pouty, the complete opposite of Shakespeare's feisty and devious supporting female role.A complete disappointment-wait for it on video.

After about tweleve release dates and a two year delay O was worth it. O the modern adaption of Shakespeare's Othello transformed the characters into rich snobs in a boarding school. Odin James(Othello) is the star of the basketball team who has brought fame to the school. Odin is also the only African-American at the school. This fits the play because Othello was the only Moore in Venice who brought it great fame. Odin was wonderfully plaid in a subtle performance by Mekhi Phifer. Josh Hartnett gives an incredible performance as Hugo(Iago) Odin's good friend who tries to bring him down. Harnett's Hugo was chilling and satanic he seemed best almost when he didn't speak but you can see it all through the eyes. Julia Stiles, in her third modern Shakespeare film,is (Desdimona) is Odin's white love interest. The story revolves around Hugo's envy towards Odin because Hugo's father, the basketball coach(Martin Sheen) seems to pay more attention to Odin than Hugo (In the play Iago has no motivation but that would make him to evil). Hugo plays to drive Odin and Desi apart by making it appear she is cheating on him. The film is incredibly realistic, especially the dialogue. The film is never improbable and the climax is incredibly intense. The three leads as well as Rain Phoniex as Hugo's confused girlfriend. The direction(Tim Blake Nelson) and the cinematography are wonderful. One of the few worthwhile films of the summer of 2001. Great for any Shakespeare fans or fans of tense drama.

You go the whole hog.  You ditch the beautiful, archaic language and picturesque names and make an honest effort to make the people look and act like real inhabitants of the 20th century.  Well done.  I'll take this movie over a thousand Loncraine RICHARD IIIs.OTHELLO is one of Shakespeare's most famous plots, and it's just as powerful today as it was when he wrote it.  Iago, called Hugo here, is one of the most terrifying villains ever written his subtlety and patience infinite, his eye for human weakness razor-sharp, his malice and capacity to abuse friendship unlimited.  You'd have to pity anyone caught in his web of deceit, but it's all the worse when the victim is as genuinely likeable a guy as Odin James (standing in for Othello).  His warmth and passion are wonderful, expressed not only in his love for Desi but also toward his friends on the court, and Mekhi Phifer delivers by far the best performance in the movie.  Isn't it odd how unusual it has become for the star of the movie also to do the best job?(Hereinafter are spoilers).Unfortunately, everybody except Phifer and screenwriter Brad Kaaya seems to be coasting on the strength of the source material.  Tim Blake Nelson's direction is  completely lacking in flair, except for the ending, all the shots gave me the feeling that Nelson had thought, `OK, now we shoot this scene,' never `OK, now what's the best way to shoot this scene?'  Josh Hartnett's Hugo is flat and wooden, not even capable of expressing sadistic joy at the success of his evil plots.  Julia Stiles as Desi cannot match Phifer's warmth of feeling; it's hard to escape the notion that Odin is just a trophy for her and that next year she'll be dating the new team MVP.  When Odin comes to her room with murder on his mind, I was silently screaming at him, `Don't do it!  For God's sake, man, no!'  But that was not so much because I felt sorry for Desi, but because I felt sorry for Odin and desperately wanted him not to screw up his life forever.Well, he does screw up his life forever; the movie is at least that faithful to Shakespeare.  And then comes the only serious objection I have with the adaptation.  Shakespeare's Othello realizes, in the last moments of his life, that the disaster which has befallen him is partly his own fault.  It is mostly Iago's fault, of course, for deceiving Othello, but without Othello's tragic flaw, his unbridled jealousy, he need not have lost his love forever.  He recognizes that he has loved not wisely, but too well.  This movie does not allow Odin to achieve that self-insight.  Instead, Odin dies blaming everything on Hugo, without recognizing that his own act in murdering Desi was wrong, and would still have been wrong even if every word Hugo had told him had been true.Rating *** out of ****.Recommendation Well worth your while on video or DVD; Shakespeare fans should buy it.

Although it is obvious that Hugo bears a great deal of jealousy towards Odin, due to the fact that his father cares more for Odin than for his own son, this is not adequately shown in the early parts of the film, nor is the actual moment or event which causes Hugo to decide to embark upon the chain of events which leads to the death of his five friends.Having not read the play myself (but I will do so now), I cannot say which parts were in the original play and which were constructed by the screenwriters, however, the movie appeared to me to flounder towards the end. It almost appeared to become so confused with itself and began flooding the viewer with details faster than they could be digested, and without anywhere near as much skill as the story had been told earlier. At the end, I think a more profound climax would have been to have Odin killed by the police (as he was brandishing a handgun at a group of scared students), and to have Hugo return home to his father grieving so much for Odin's loss that Hugo once again faded into the background - showing that for all the manipulation, murder, deceit and death, Hugo ended up right back where he began, the invisible son of the basketball coach.

I mean, Shakespearean talk sounds nice, but it just doesn't seem to fit in a world of iPods and such.So, I recommend O, even if the cast members sometimes try a little to hard to emote.

I think shakespearian feelings require more... balance and I daresay they are much more subtle. The stake of this undertaking quickly goes shady and turns Hartnett's so-called Machiavellian schemes into the sort of gossip you can hear in a Wal-Mart supermarket. As an evidence for his defence, I shall recall that in his latest movie someone checked his bed with a semen detector. How posh. May we understand this poor boy's trauma and therefore the one of his costars, Julia Stiles and Mekhi Phifer, a very cute couple but who remains helpless.
