I made my father take me to see it over and over again. And to this say I still watch it every once in a while.I guess the main appeal of it when I was younger is that the villain  somewhat resembled Freddy Krueger and the lead actress Jenifer Rubin was from A Nightmare on Elm st. 3. The film doesn't offer much in the way of truly effective horror. But it makes up for it in creativity. It veers from the typical horror route going into a slightly more intellectual one and trying to induce psychological scares. Sometime they work and sometimes they won't. But at any rate the film is quite enjoyable with one hell of a twist ending.  Maybe it's the nostalgia I feel towards it or maybe it's still because it has such a kick ass poster.

I remember at the time I thought the movie was pretty cool. I didnt see the movie again until about a year ago , when I picked up a used copy of it. Since then I have watched the movie a couple times, and I think its pretty awesome. its got some scary sences, and its definately got that old style 80s horror feel to it, which I miss. Its also crazy how similar this movie is to the 1987 masterpeice,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3- Dream Worriors. This movie's main star is Jennifer Ruben, who played Taryn in Nightmare 3...and just like in Nightmare 3, Bad Dreams is about a group of troubled kids who are in a mental institution, being haunted in there dreams by a burned boogeyman. It was cool to see Jennifer Ruben in another horror movie. This, and Nightmare 3, are the only two movies I can remember her in.

The plot involves a spiritual sect with a textbook leader type that performed a mass suicide ritual in the 70's. One girl survived and she awakes from her coma 13 years later. Immediately after, she's haunted by hallucinations and nightmares in which the leader returns comes to tell her she has to fulfill her promise to the group and commit suicide after all. When she refuses, the leader leads other victims into death and he easily finds them among the psychiatric patients of the hospital. As stated earlier, the plot of Bad Dreams isn't very unique and borrows elements from over a dozen other (horror) movies. Mostly from 'Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors' (the image of the horribly burned leader even resembles the Freddy Kruger pizza-face!) and the group session looks inspired by 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'. But who cares? Very few movies are completely original and at least this film offers spectacular amusement. Andrew Fleming's Bad Dreams upholds a good tempo, it has a great soundtrack (including a demented version of 'My Way' and a Guns 'n Roses classic during the end credits) and there's enough blood and gore to satisfy the most demanding horror buff. We see how people are getting burned, stabbed or thrown from high buildings. Two poor bastards even get hacked up in a ventilation system! Is that bloody enough for you? And yes, at some points, Fleming even succeeds in creating tension and eeriness. Especially the sequence where Cynthia has her first hallucination in the broken elevator is memorable. Last but not least Bad Dreams has a terrific B-movie cast filled with familiar faces. Jennifer Rubin plays the lead and she suffered from the same issues before in Nightmare on Elm Street. Bruce Abbott stars as a dedicated shrink and you'll unquestionably recognize him from the one and only Re-Animator. There also are neat supportive roles for Dean Cameron (Summer School), Harris Yulin (Scarface, 24) and even the lovely singer E.G. Daily makes an appearance! I say you better ignore the unusually large amount of negative reviews and give this one a look.

Bad Dreams is just a flashy title to lure viewers, making them think it's another Elm Street ripoff. Forget about Elm Street. Watch this one with an open mind. The only similarities it has to Elm Street three are these A burned up psycho, a mental hospital (in which the patients are much more believable than the ones of NOES 3) and Jennifer Rubin. That's where the similarities end. The heroine of the film is not, in fact, having dreams, but hallucinations. You never once see her go to sleep and dream of this guy, he just shows up (usually conveniently after she's taken her meds. Hmmmm!)

The premise seems a bit familiar to A Nightmare on Elm Street 3Dream Warriors at times. Especially when Rubin had a supporting role in the Nightmare franchise. Dean Cameron (Best known from Men at Work and Summer School) and E.G. Daily (Who's known as the voice of Tommy Pickles in the TV Rugrats) are also in the movie. Bad Dreams is quite impressive for two-thirds of the way but the last act feels rushed and out of touch with the rest of the picture. Fleming, who directed his first film handles like a pro on his first feature. The main problem, the screenplay by the director and Steven E. de Souza (Commando, Die Hard, 48 Hrs) could have been much stronger at times, especially towards the last act. But still, it's well made and horror fans will enjoy it. It's worth a look, despite some flaws. From a story by the director, Michael Dick, P.J. Pettiette and Yuri Zeltser. Gale Anne Hurd also produced it. She's best known for producing movies like Aliens, The Hulk and The Terminator. (*** Â½/*****).

She ends up in a coma for thirteen years, but when she awakes, several of her fellow patients at the psychiatric hospital start dying. It appears like they are committing suicide, but could it be murder? The film is a lot like A Nightmare on Elm St 3, which also stared Jennifer Rubin. There is a burned man seemingly going after the patients, the doctors believe the people are killing themselves are refuse to think otherwise. Although it is similar, Bad Dreams is a decent horror flick with some gruesome moments.The hospital setting in a horror film is always fun to me. You would think it's safe, but it almost never is.

Spending her days in a mental hospital without any family to speak of, Cynthis attempts to revive memories of her past before the house fire which took the lives of those she cared about. Her memories will assist the police in closing a case long spent open as Detective Wasserman(Sy Richardson), working the scene at that time, remains convinced that Cynthia's not the victim she seems to be. His feelings are assisted when members of Cynthia's therapy group, each known for suicidal tendencies, each begin killing themselves, with her nearby, believing she's a possible catalyst as to their sudden decisions to end it all under grisly circumstances. Before each member of her therapy group dies, Cynthia is either visited by Harris(..either as he was in the 60's or with charred burnt flesh)or sees him following them. Her assigned psychiatric physician, Dr. Alex Karmen(Bruce Abbott), doesn't believe in Cynthia's bogeyman manifesting from her nightmares to kill members of her therapy group and is convinced there's another type of motivation causing the strange suicides which have began to emerge. Karmen pursue the truth with odd resistance from his own superior, Berrisford, as Cynthia slowly falls prey to her hallucinations(..or are they?) of Harris who beckons to join his unity where those she once knew await her on the other side. If she doesn't end her own life Harris will continue to take souls..it's up to her.Slippery thriller, almost completely set in the mental hospital, where the viewer is to guess whether what Cynthia sees(..nightmare man, Harris, who pops up often to spook her)is real or a product of fantasy fueled by something malicious. Rubin's beauty is used rather well as she's often running around in a gown, conflicted and confused about her present mental state. Great villainous heavy Richard Lynch has a tailor-made star vehicle, often showcased in terrifying burn make-up, as the supposed supernatural killer causing the patients under Karmen's care to off themselves. Berrisford's philosophy and unorthodox methods of treatment for the patients under Karmen's care is of the utmost importance to the plot, but it's subtly infused within the story. While the similarities to Nightmare on Elm Street are striking(..Part 3 in particular which also starred Rubin in her first film and was set in a mental hospital), Bad Dreams ultimate twist at the end pries it apart from the Freddy Krueger franchise. Still, I imagine many will shrug their shoulders at this film as merely a rip from the franchise being that it concerns a nightmare man, with a burnt face no less, terrorizing Rubin. The title doesn't help the film's cause either. The film has a strong cast with Abbott(..fresh off the heels of Re-Animator), Yulin, as usual portraying the quietly malevolent and untrustworthy type of character who reeks of malicious intent, and Dean Cameron(Summer School)as a jokester with a nasty streak that explodes into violent rage at the very end when alone with Cynthia. Those familiar with Susan Barnes sweetheart in LA Law will find her very profane and confrontational patient Connie quite a polar opposite(..or polarizing, to be more specific). The gore is limited but there are inspired sequences of violence such as what one patient does to himself with surgical scalpels, the aftermath of a couple who decide to hurl themselves into the hospital turbines(..lots of blood spray spurting from ventilation shafts leave quite a lasting impression), and a suicidal leap onto the steps from an upper floor window. But, Lynch's burn make-up delivers the ultra-creepy goods. I think despite seeming unoriginal and rather familiar(derivative), Bad Dreams remains quite entertaining as the plot plays out and all the pieces fall into place. And, if anything, you have Lynch's tour-de-force performance to enjoy. Great little kill-fantasy played out in Karmen's mind after Berrisford fires him.

Slick direction coupled with descent acting, effective gore scenes, and true-to-life cult activity spices up this unappreciated horror gem. Critics savaged it, and it doesn't seem to have much of a following, but it leaves an undeniable sense of creepiness and dread when the final credits roll (to an early version of Guns N' Roses Sweet Child O' Mine.) Jennifer Rubin's sleepy demeanor fits well into this role, shortly after her stint on Elm Street 3 as a recovering heroin addict. Re-Animator's Bruce Cabot gives a decent supporting performance as the main character's doctor, who seems to have more than a passing interest in his socially defunct patient. It's not spoiling too much to say there is a twist ending that explains a lot of the weirdness going on throughout the movie. What do you expect when watching a movie about a bunch of patients in a mental ward? Good quirky performance by Dean Cameron, he of Summer School fame. Great tag-line, as well. U-N-I-T-Y...Unity...Join us! Too bad it never got an intended sequel...for 20th Century Fox was hoping to score a hit with the film as a continuing franchise, like that of the Elm Street movies. There's some good black humor thrown in for a couple of devious chuckles, but the trick to enjoying this flick is just to leave your expectations at the door and try to enjoy a good old-fashioned spook show. This is probably of the best things director Andrew Fleming ever did, as he went on to do other studio pictures like Threesome and The Craft. Great Soundtrack too!

A psych ward group slowly being killed? A sympathetic male doctor? Jennifer Rubin? Hey, this sounds exactly like A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 DREAM WARRIORS! And that is probably exactly what 20th Century Fox was hoping audiences would think with this attempt to cash in on the late 80s ELM STREET craze. It is too bad because hidden somewhere in BAD DREAMS is a good horror movie.With four writers getting a story by credit, BAD DREAMS reeks of shaping a object to fit the mold. Credited screenwriters Stephen de Souza and director Andrew Fleming present a fairly engaging mystery of a crazed doctor who is experimenting with various drugs on his patients to prove his theories on insanity. Unfortunately they unfold it in a scenario so similar to the third ELM STREET film that one wonders if litigation was ever pursued. Nowhere is this attempt more obvious than the sure to evoke Kruger title of BAD DREAMS. Shame no one in the film actually experiences bad dreams because all of the psychotic reactions are to drug induced hallucinations. I guess BAD HALLUCINATIONS didn't test well? The fact that nothing in this film comes off as original mars the plot's better aspects.To its credit, BAD DREAMS features a great cast. Female lead Rubin, last seen in A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 (!), may have hurt the film's chances of originality even more but she is good in her role. The casting of Richard Lynch as the cult leader is interesting if you know his back story. While under the influence of LSD in the 60s, Lynch actually did set himself on fire. Inspired casting or exploitation? You be the judge but Lynch is really creepy in the role. He keeps the character of cult leader Harris very sinister, something the ELM STREET series had long since abandoned with Freddy. Director Fleming should also get credit for casting Harris Yulin as the evil doctor. Yulin has very similar features to Lynch so it work well in the context of the story (Rubin sees Lynch in her hallucinations when it is really Yulin). Bruce Abbott, coming off his previous stint as a med student in RE-ANIMATOR (1985), graduates to a full fledged doctor and shows he is capable of carrying a studio backed feature, big sweaters notwithstanding. Perhaps the film's best performance is Dean Cameron as psychotic patient Ralph. Probably best known as horror fan Chainsaw, Cameron delivers some well timed sardonic comedy (a lot of which was improvised according to his website).On top of the acting, BAD DREAMS is a very well made film. Fleming has a nice visual style and handles the scares well. In fact, I would argue this is a better made film than most of the ELM STREET sequels (and it was actually made for less). Both the cinematography and editing are top notch. All of the murders are well staged with the 70s fire/suicide being the highlight. In terms of horror films, Fleming went on to direct the well received THE CRAFT a few years later. In addition to a creepy score by Jay Ferguson, The Chamber Brother's Time Has Come Today is used effectively through out the film to evoke the 70s.Unfotunately this experiment in flattery didn't get very far with audiences, raking in only $9 million at the box office. A paltry sum when compared to the previous year's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 ($44 million) or the same year's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 ($49 million). It may not be true in the real world, but in the cinematic world Robert Englund can take Richard Lynch any day. As it stands, BAD DREAMS is a time capsule to remind genre fans how much influence Wes Craven's creation had back in the day.

Trying to get on with her life, she starts to realize that her fellow patients in the mental hospital start dying in brutal ways, and start seeing hallucinations/dreams/visions of Harris, the burnt up cult leader. Is he back from the grave, vowing revenge for Cynthia's survival, or is something more sinister going on? Rather then going the clichÃ© way in my review and bashing this movie for its direct influences from A Nightmare on Elm Street 3, I'll just say that they never got in the way of my enjoyment of this film. A lot of movies rip off others all the time, so I don't seem to ever get annoyed by these.The film has top notch production values, a very entertaining cast, and some warped out death scenes. You can see how the movie just wants to be a good thriller and does so almost effortlessly. I remember my dad buying a old VHS copy when I was 9 or so and not really liking it's cover, but since I didn't want to hurt my dad's feelings I stuck it up and pretended to be excited, and watched it, and ever since then I have a place in my (movie watching) heart for this, perhaps just based on that back story alone.One thing that I really enjoy is the actors. Lot's of familiar and likable faces in the house. I invested more into the movie by that way. I do admit the characters of the mental patients aren't fully developed enough though, I wanted to know more and see more about them, like the very sympathetic Lana (played quite well by Elizabeth Daily). She has a scene where she opens up her heart and I started liking her, but the movie is quick to get to the gore and kills and her plight is cut way to short. Same could be said for Dean Cameron and Susan Barnes.The directing by Andrew Fleming is basically there to serve the story, nothing to stand out. I would have preferred to see a director with a more unique visual voice (all of the Flemings movies never have stand out visuals) it would have made the movie more stand out, and his angles are pretty bland. Good scene transitions though.The soundtrack by Jay Ferguson was much appreciated and quite dreamy. Far better then his over the top attempt with Nightmare 5 Dream Child.The kills and gore are very queasy, and people who have dealt with a suicide or (god forbid) seen a suicide will surly be offended by this movie, but since I'm a avid horror fan I was never offended, but they certainly had cruel streak.Some flaws that hurt the movie are the lack of character development (as stated) and the movie's ending felt rushed, forced, and cut short. What happened to our survivors? I hate endings that never show the characters reactions after the events are over. One thing I will compare to Nightmare 3 is the ending, which was done there was well. Please take at least 4 or so minutes to better resolve our characters. The surprise in the end wasn't fully explored either, it somewhat didn't make much sense to me. What is this persons final goal when he succeeds? So maybe because I didn't want to hurt my dad's feelings at an early age, makes me warm up to this easier, or maybe it is just decent effort that can be watched from time to time. But be warned, this movie deals with suicide in a crude manner and surely will offend some.

Jump forward thirteen years later & Cynthia wakes from a coma she has been in for all those years, having to adjust to late 80's culture & come to terms with the situation she is put under the care of psychiatrist Dr. Berrisford (Harris Yulin) & his assistant Dr. Karmen (Bruce Abbott) & regularly take part in therapy sessions. However it's not long before her old cult leader Harris comes back from beyond the grave to claim her & reunite her with those who sacrificed themselves...Co-written & directed by Andrew Fleming when I sat down to watch this last night I had never heard of Bad Dreams before & thought it sounded like some recent cheap generic low budget shot on videotape horror flick & expected the worse, as the film started the 20th Century Fox film logo came up & my interest instantly peaked & I thought 'wow, a major Hollywood studio, this might be decent', the titles ran & I noticed a few familiar names like Bruce Abbott from the Re-Animator (1985) series of films, Gale Anne Hurd who produced a lot of James Cameron's films like The Terminator (1984) & Aliens (1986) produced it while Steven E. de Souza who had only a few years previously wrote the likes of 48 Hrs. (1982), Commando (1985) & The Running Man (1987) co-wrote it in the same year he would write the absolute classic Die Hard (1988) so there was definitely some pedigree both in front & behind the camera here & it show's as Bad Dreams is a surprisingly little known decent horror flick. The script by Souza & Fleming borrows heavily from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series of films, a main villain who is burned & as a ghost comes back from beyond the grave to terrorise & kill people although one has to say despite the title he never turns up in people's dreams as he appears as a ghostly entity. The similarity with A Nightmmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors (1987) in particular is striking, the group of psychiatric patients fighting against a villain from beyond the grave, the doctors who won't believe them & the two films in general feel & look very alike. Then just when you think you have it all worked out as a simple Elm Street rip-off the film springs an effective if unlikely twist ending which comes out of nowhere & no reasonable explanation for it is given but it's certainly memorable. The character's are good, the dialogue is amusing & sharp, it moves along at a decent pace & there's one or two nicely gory set-pieces too. Much better than expected although I went into it with zero expectations so that wasn't exactly difficult.Director Fleming makes his directorial debut here (his only other horror film of note would be The Craft (1996)) & does a good job, the film looks nice enough with some nice sequences. The scene inside the Unity Fields house where everyone is set on fire is very effective & the special effects during this scene are also very good. There's some gore here, someone jumps out of a window & splats on the pavement below, someone slices their arms with scalpels & then stabs themselves in the stomach, there are burned faces, there's a ventilation system full of blood that spurts it out everywhere & there's a severed hand.With a very healthy sounding budget of about $4,000,000 this is well made with good production values & the special effects are impressive. The acting is good from a competent cast.Bad Dreams sounds like some cheap dull horror flick & at first it seems like an Elm Street film rip-off but it's more than that & once it's got you thinking you know exactly what's going to happen it springs a twist ending out of nowhere, I just wish it made a bit more sense. Definitely well worth a watch I reckon.

Even with some creative cracks, it should've been better. The story's direction seems a little uneven if it wants to go out to shock (a good amount of blood splatter is spilt), or play its cards for psychological torment.

The beautiful Jennifer Rubin is exceptional in brining out a vulnerable side, which is counter-punched by determination. Alongside her are a very good Bruce Abbott and a towering Richard Lynch brings an uneasy subtly to his menacing character. Harris Yulin, Sy Richardson, Susan Ruttan and an amusingly batty Dean Cameron chip in with durable support. Andrew Fleming's leisured direction is stylish, but has that breakable quality to it. Good use of lighting, colouring and composition in pockets drips of atmosphere. The material is enjoyable (if minimal), as the protagonist tries to overcome the hallucinations that might be because of her unstable state of mind or the simple reality of being haunted by a restless spirit. There's some black humour evident, but the by-the-numbers script goes about things rather seriously. As well it has a fine and compelling soundtrack to boot. The special effects and make-up FX stands-up well enough. A decent little film. "},{"Title":"This had some good moments.  Also a definite 1980's Slasher vibe.  But, overall I felt it was somewhat weak.  Blu-ray OK  A8  V7","Date":"19 May 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" This film definitely had the 1980's vibe going strong in it's look and feel. Usually, if you are one to like the 'Classic' Slasher films of that time period, you pretty much know what to expect. Unfortunately, although there ARE some scattered good moments in the film, overall I honestly got the impression that overall it just didn't hold together terribly well. The IDEA was pretty good, and for me anyway, ANY film that starts with almost a full rendition of The Electric Prunes 'I Had too Much to Dream Last Night' is pretty damn awesome. Some of the soundtrack choices were effective too. And, at times the director did create a nice mood. But, I don't know exactly what it was, probably the direction since the director usually has final control of how the movie comes across, flows, and ties together. You kind of got the feeling that the actors were just not quite really into it and I feel that that comes across in the performances. Also, there are many awkward moments where the patients would be acting odd or doing their thing, but to me, it didn't come across as believable. To me, many times it seemed like a number of odd, sub-par performances roughly strung together.Most decent Slashers usually keep a good pace and keep the action going so that the story moves quickly for the audience. I didn't get that here... I think that perhaps if it could have be tightened up a bit and if the performances elicited by the director and maybe the specific shots used had been done better, than the movie would have been much more involving and more entertaining. The only way I can think of to put it, to explain the overall feel that it gave me, is that it just didn't seem to 'Flow' quite right. But, like I said, it definitely had it's moments. But, I think just too many scenes were weak. For example, not giving anything away, but one scene with the hyper patient towards the end when he took Jennifer Rubin with him down into the basement or somewhere, the scene where he was throwing a fit dragged on and on and on and just really seemed like padding and was pretty stupid. Unfortunately, there were just too many weak moments, maybe not QUITE as bad as that scene, but weak all the same. Also, without saying too much, the 'twist' towards the end was an excellent idea and gave a nice added punch to the story. But again, it was almost too little too late... I really like the guy playing the young doctor (wasn't he the romantic lead in 'REANIMATOR') but even he seemed like he was trying REALLY hard not to sleepwalk through the film. Jennifer Rubin didn't impress very much; she just looked kind of stoned the whole time. She was a HELL of a lot better in 'NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3' Also, it would have been nice to see E.G. Daily do a bit more too.So... just rating this against other Slashers, I really can't get too worked up by it. I felt that even though the premise was very good and even though there WERE some good moments in it, overall compared to most other average to decent Slashers, I just found this one a bit limp, mainly because it just didn't seem that sharply put together. The current rating of '5.5' is about right; I gave it a '5' because I couldn't quite give it a '6' In my honest, lowly and wretched opinion, I truly think that there are a LOT better Slasher films out there...

As Cynthia tries to assimilate into life again, those around her in the hospital begin dying in mysterious suicides&#x97; and the fact that Cynthia is beginning to see the ghost of the cult leader lurking around doesn't make things look all that great.This was one film that has been on my to watch list for a long time, but I have to say it was a pleasant surprise and far exceeded my expectations. Surprisingly high-gloss, the film, directed by Andrew Fleming (who later found success as a mainstream Hollywood director) was released in 1988 by 20th Century Fox with the expectation that it would become a blockbuster and ignite a franchise of sorts&#x97; neither of these things happened, and for understandable reasons, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this is a really well-made horror film, especially by '80s standards.The comparisons to A Nightmare on Elm Street are fair enough, although the truth is that this film really doesn't have all that much to do with dreams at all&#x97; it's really about the traumatic effects dealt onto a young woman who spent her childhood in a sinister cult, which makes for grim subject matter as is. It is a slasher film in an unconventional sense&#x97; that being that the deaths are suicides&#x97; but the setups for each of them are based on the maneuvering hand of Harris, the malevolent cult leader's ghost. Lots of great special effects here that should be taken note of, and really nice photography. The film has a polished studio look that isn't particularly common for slasher films of this era. Jennifer Rubin plays the doe- eyed, flighty Cynthia convincingly, and Re-Animantor's Bruce Abbott plays her psychiatrist/eventual love interest; Richard Lynch is in stark opposition as the wild-eyed cult leader, who spends half of the film covered in gruesome fourth degree burns.Overall, Bad Dreams is an effective thriller and is a surprisingly classy oddball of the late 1980s slasher crop. While the film's victim count feels by-the-numbers, it is still an entertaining watch bolstering some solid performances and a visibly adept craftsmanship behind it. It's no surprise that Fleming found success with his later more mainstream pictures given what he was able to pull off here. Worth some attention from any fans of eighties horror. 7/10.

For a horror movie that came out a quarter of a century ago it still proves to be scary. I haven't seen a cult horror movie in a long time and it was a welcome topic. Cults always have a way of coming off creepy and provide the perfect material for a scary movie. The scariest thing is when you witness the strong beliefs of cult members and just how trusting they can be.If your looking for a creepy 80's horror film (along the same lines as nightmare on elm street) then this is a great choice. It made me nervous the whole way through with it's eerie music and clinical setting. The actors also did a fantastic job. Surprisingly everything felt real and they completely immersed themselves in their characters. A must see for all lovers of vintage horror movies. "},{"Title":"It has some interesting plot points.","Date":"1 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Watchable, sometimes offbeat and humorous horror film that seems as if it intends to coast on the success of the Nightmare on Elm Street series but ends up going on its own merry path. It works best when our heroine is still trying to make sense of macabre events and is not sure what the truth is. The writing is silly at times, but there are also fun moments. Some of the special effects are bad, yet at the same time there's some hilarious over the top gore. Making it entertaining enough to watch are some great lines and a number of amusing, attention-getting performances.The movie stars Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors cast member Jennifer Rubin as Cynthia, who as a child had survived a suicide pact engineered by ultra creepy cult leader Harris (Richard Lynch at his best). Now she's a 20 something adult who's just awakened from a coma, and she's put into group therapy run by kindly Alex Karmen (Bruce Abbott of Re- Animator fame). Soon the people in this group start to die horrible deaths and Cynthia is convinced that Harris's spirit (which sometimes appears to her as a nastily charred corpse) is the one killing them.Rubin is appealing if not that good as an actress; at least she conveys a sense of naivety and innocence. Abbott is good, as is the excellent character actor Harris Yulin - a man who's always excelled at playing unbelievably smug and pompous jerks - as Karmens' colleague. Dean Cameron (Summer School) supplies a lot of the comedy, improvising most of his best lines (you have to pay attention to catch one of them). Susan Barnes and Sy Richardson (both from Repo Man), Louis Giambalvo (Weekend at Bernie's), ever adorable actress / singer / voice over artist Elizabeth Daily, Susan Ruttan ('L.A. Law'), and Charles voice of Roger Rabbit Fleischer all put in appearances as well.Co-written and directed by Andrew Fleming (The Craft), this is intriguing for a while - with a memorable revenge / black comedy sequence near the end - but ultimately comes to a humdrum conclusion. It does show off Rubins' beauty to great effect and can boast some good visual tricks and scene transitions. Oscar winner Michele Burke does the nicely grisly makeup effects.Overall, not bad; it may be worth viewing for devotees of 80s genre fare.Six out of 10.

Bad Dreams is like another side of Elm Street. What I dig about, is it's intriguing storyline. Surviving a mass cult suicide, beautiful, innocent, virtuous Cynthia, Jennifer Rubin, wakes up after a thirteen year coma, (apparently we learn the longest is 37 years). She starts off her recovery in a mental ward, still clinging to her dead friends, one big happy family at the beautiful Unity Fields, out yonder, where they swallow all of that, you know. And one thing you'll never forget about Unity Fields, the devoted cult leader, Harris, played by the evil faced, Richard Lynch, an ugly Rutger Hauer'ish looking guy, the one true acting standout in this. Cynthia strikes up a kind of relationship, with her principal psychiatrist, Alan (Bruce Re-animator Abbott) the only one who really agrees this is the wrong environment for her. Cynthia's sanity isn't really helped, or convincing to others of the medical field, when starts seeing things, mainly a resurrected Harris, who keeps reappearing, sometimes in not the most the healthy states. Or poor young Cynthia could be delusional. And why are the patients, suiciding, one by one, some of them in pretty gruesome ways, a couple making a death pact, choosing to go through a mini turbine creating a blood shower, as you will. Is it Harris, taking them, for Cynthia not holding up her end of the bargain. I don't want to give anymore more away, just to say, Bad Dreams works just as well as a horror as it does a thriller. The familiar actors, though you would have to be more of a eighties type to know 'em, give their mentally unbalanced characters, spark and oomph, especially Dean Cameron, a comedic asset to this slick horror, that will surprise and appease gore hounds who hasn't vide'd this one. Harris Yulin, an acting treasure again gives a fine, performance, as a shady veteran shrink. You wouldn't think this film of b grade appeal, barely making a showing at the cinema back in 88, would surprise you with such an effortful storyline, but Bad Dreams does, it's title indeed one of sarcasm. It's a short nifty horror, that's bloody entertaining, especially thanks to that handful of patients, and Harris. "},{"Title":"One of the Better Slasher Movies of the Late 80s","Date":"20 September 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" As any long time horror fan will tell you, by 1988, the slasher well that had been prominent earlier in the decade was pretty much dried up. Horror films from this period tended to be on the comedic side with less of an emphasis on straight horror. One of the films to buck this trend however was Bad Dreams. In the beginning of the film we see a young girl, Cynthia, a member of a cult involved in a ritual with her fellow members. The cult leader played by(Richard Lynch)is a Jim Jones/Charles Manson combination tells the group how they will be together as one following the ritual. What Cynthia soon realizes is that ol' cult leader man actually has mass suicide in mind. We soon witness various cult members dowse themselves with gasoline and set themselves alight. The house soon becomes a bonfire with the cult members trapped inside. The police and ambulances arrive but are there any survivors? In fact there is one survivor, Cynthia. Flash forward 13 years, Cynthia,now played by Jennifer Rubin (Nightmare on Elm Street 3), wakes up from her coma. Yes, she has been kept alive all of these years. She is now a ward of the state and lives in the hospital cum mental institute. She begins a group therapy session to readjust to after being in a coma that has spanned half of her life. The doctor in charge of the therapy, is played by Bruce Abbott (from the first two Re Animator films.)Cynthia meets the assorted oddballs who are members of the group. We have our kooky love birds, our bi-polar comedian/aggressor, our bitter conspiracy theorist, and two women; one who looks like a female Steve Urkel and a tiny brunette who apparently borrowed Jennifer Tilly's voice. Once Cynthia emerges from her coma, she begins to see her former cult leader in various places throughout the hospital. Is he still alive or is it all in her mind? The members of the group begin dying in mysterious ways. At first they are marked off as suicides but after a while it becomes apparent someone wants them dead.Does Cynthia's reawakening have anything to do with the deaths? If you read my review of Killer Party,you know I enjoy talking about songs in movies. Bad Dreams does not have anything as awesome as April or The Best Times of Our Lives, but does include Time by The Chambers Brothers. It's one of the more unsettling songs from the late 60s and by far the creepiest of the seemingly endless songs named Time. If you missed it the first time it plays in the movie, don't worry. You'll hear it again and again throughout the film.The acting, with a few exceptions, is one of the main drawbacks of the film. Jennifer Rubin, although easy on the eyes, does not exactly give a stellar performance. Her character in Nightmare on Elm Street 3 tells us that in her dreams she is beautiful and bad. She carries the beauty into Bad Dreams but the way in which she is bad has a different connotation this time around.That's not to say she is terrible by any means,but she's not exactly Amy Steele in Friday the 13th part 2.The notable exception in Bad Dreams is Ralph, played by Dean Cameron. He gives quite a good performance as the joke and sex crazed funny man one minute, and the startling psychotic the next.I've always enjoyed his work, especially his role in one of my all time favorite guilty pleasures, Miracle Beach, in which he co-starred with the super adorable Ami Dolenz. That's a review for a different time. Overall, Bad Dreams is parts hit and miss. I'm a slasher completest, and would find something good to say about the movie whether it was good or not. As a slasher it works for the most part. It's not the most obvious whodunit I've seen but it's in the top 10. My rating 6.5/10 blood pouring air vents.

Cynthia finds out quickly that the ghost of Harris is back... to claim her.....Ironically called Bad Dreams, the film is essentially a remake of A Nightmare On Elm Part Three The Dream Warriors, everyone in the institution is haunted by the title of the film, and Lynch is essentially Freddy, burnt features included.And while its a watchable movie, and Dean Cameron is in it (and the best thing), it gets a little bland, and Rubin really starts to grate on you after a while.Lynch pops up every now and again in his Bonanza outfit, to say something sinister, and one by one people die, much to the perplextion of a running doctor, but the narrative doesn't compliment the story.There are a few standout scenes, the opening sequence is amazing, but it really falls apart when we hit present day... "},{"Title":"Bad Dreams (1988)","Date":"29 January 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Cynthia (Jennifer Rubin, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors) had 13 years of peace and security. Sadly, these years took place while she was in a coma. When she awakens from her long lapse, she is at loss with the world; and simply is not ready for the 80's. She finds herself in a mental hospital with an extremely vivid group of crazies. Quickly, Cynthia tries to convince Dr. Alex Karmen (Bruce Abbott, Re-Animator) that she does not belong there. However, he feels letting her problems out during group sessions will help her prepare from a fresh start. Sorry to say, it does not take long for Harris (Richard Lynch, Invasion U.S.A.), the sadistic organizer of Unity to come for Cynthia; and take her to a new light after death.Now first off, yes. Bad Dreams is a certainly not a unique story; but this is actually a movie that takes from others and succeeds, if not surpasses in creativity. The opening shot is purely an introduction of the cult itself and the suicide. Both aspects will haunt Cynthia for the duration of the film. Harris returns to her for one simple motive, because she survived. He wants her to join them in eternal bliss by killing herself. As long as she refuses to rejoin with Unity, a mental patient from the hospital will take her place in perfect harmony.This was the first film director Andrew Fleming (The Craft) tagged under his belt; and the movie has many interesting shots to offer. Flashbacks and old video documentations of the Unity cult are shown brilliantly, leaping back and forth from close ups of Harris' face to his brainwashed followers. The flashbacks of him are mixed into video footage of interviews with the sect. Harris' supporters are realistically disturbing casting an emotionless glare in their eyes and so convinced that all they feel is love.The flashbacks that Cynthia has to undergo are the most unsettling. While in the middle of a group discussion at the hospital (Cynthia, Dr. Karmen and the crazies), she is whisked away back to the cult house, the day of the tragic event. She lives the nightmare twice. All of the group members surround the room doused in gasoline waiting for death. Anticipating what is past the dominion of life as the flames begin to spread over the carpet and hardwood floor. Then the fire attacks. Lovers clench one another as they burn. A father and his two sons hold each other tight as they melt away. Some are screaming in torture, others are crawling across the floor still believing they are headed some place special. In the center of all the carnage stands Harris in flames, taunting Cynthia to come with them. This is one of the most grisly scenes of Bad Dreams, and one of the best.Between the years 1987 and '88, Jennifer Rubin could not seem to stay away from mental hospitals, nor could she get rid of homicidal maniacs with a massive burn scab for a body. First, she did Elm Street 3 then this gem. She is no stranger to the horror genre, yet her performance ends up being only decent. Cynthia's character comes off a little hazy; a deeper perception of unstableness with herself, as well as things around her should have been made clearer. Overall, Rubin does enough to get the job done; she just does not stand out. Bruce Abbott plays Dr. Alex Karmen, and you can bet his degree did not come from Miskatonic Medical School. He grows a closer attachment to Cynthia than the rest of his patients; because he knows deep down she does not belong there. Abbott, like Rubin does a well enough job to keep the story sturdy, but nothing to write home about.Richard Lynch usually plays the villain in films, and he has the ability to do so effectively. Harris is still a different role for him, though. He manages to pull off being evil and menacing with a touch of passive serenity in unison. His appearance also comes in two flavors, regular or burnt to a crisp. That is right; Cynthia is haunted by visions of Harris in before and after the fire aspects. Lynch stands out here, and his significance in the role is one reason the movie succeeds. Dean Cameron (Summer School) plays Ralph, the most intriguing of all the patients. He is blatantly honest, and extremely on edge. When his tension builds, he cuts a whole in his body to release his anger in order to calm down. Anytime Cameron is on screen in Bad Dreams, he steals the show completely. This character alone gives the film a truly uneasy mood.The makeup FX are handled by Michele Burke (Terror Train, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Interview with the Vampire), and some gory suicide style deaths are presented. The greatest achievement is the makeup job on Richard Lynch, though. Harris makes Freddy Kruger look like a pretty face. He is totally barbecued from head to toe. The little additions throw this film to the top of the gross-out scale, though. His right ear hangs from his head by a tiny thread of skin, teeth burnt brown around the edges, and one of his eyes blinded white. Scorched skin all over his face and skull are slightly peeled and curled up, like burning newspaper around wood in a fireplace. This character is no joke, and Burke did a fantastic job at making him horrendous as possible.Somehow, Bad Dreams manages to be unique, despite its similarities to Elm Street 3. Ultimately, it ends up being all together different, and refreshing.

So much goes into the making of a film and so often it ends up being a waste. The 1980s was the most prolific decade for the Horror genre, which was both a blessing and a curse. It was a time when movies were sequelized to death and concepts were repeated ad nauseum. Of course coping other works was nothing new then and doesn't always spell failure. The 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series was hugely popular at this time and influenced many other films, including this little known flick from the man who gave us 'The Craft' less than a decade later. What it isn't is a waste of time, what it is is an above average genre effort that borrows from better films, but isn't one of the many that's no better than a xerox copy.Pros Excellent performances from the cast and memorable characters. Director Andrew Fleming makes this pretty suspenseful. Nicely scored and some good song choices. Moves at a quick pace all the way. A few effectively chilling sequences. Plenty of the red stuff and some well done gore. A neat twist you won't likely see coming.Cons Plot wears thin. Doesn't exactly break any new ground. Some subplots and characters that could have used some fleshing out. Derivative of better movies, mostly 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 3,' which ironically Jennifer Rubin starred in.Final thoughts So many movies rip-off others and fail to stand on their own two feet. 'Bad Dreams' is hardly original and not one of the scariest movies you'll ever find, but the ingredients are combined well and the talent in front of and behind the camera is strong, making this better than it deserves to be.

The problem is that it was a blatant attempt to cash in on the Nightmare On Elm St franchise and it's glaringly obvious, particularly with it's similarities to the third movie. I'll make my point with this list 1. Bad guy gets burnt alive and comes back to haunt people in dreams (although in 'Bad Dreams' it's more hallucinations really so I don't know why they called it such other than to attract Elm St fans.) 2. Both 'Bad Dreams' and Elm St 3 are set in very similar looking hospitals where they have group sessions and one of the patients is played by Jennifer Rubin. The patients begin to see visions/dreams of a burnt man before dying.3. At one point needing a hall pass is mentioned which sounded like a reference to Elm St 1.4. A doctor in this is the same actor who plays a doctor in Elm St 1.5. In Elm St 3 Phillip falls from a high window to his death which appears like a suicide. The same happens with a character in this movie and the music in each of these two scenes are strikingly similar.I'm sure there were others but you get the picture. Otherwise they're really very different movies. Bad Dreams lacks the imaginative dream sequences and really over the top fantastic deaths of Elm St 3 but it plays things very seriously and a result is at least a much scarier horror movie. The villain is played by Richard Lynch which is the most perfect piece of casting as he looks scary to start with; you see visions of him both burnt and not burnt and the not burnt ones are actually scarier! What I don't understand is why they created so many similarities to Elm St 1 and 3 as the movie is very strong in it's own right and by the end you realise it has little in common otherwise. Maybe it was the production company asking for a new Elm St style movie so they tried a little too hard to please them. Maybe if it wasn't for the similarities this movie would be considered a classic. In any case, this is an underrated 80's horror gem with a great plot and scarier than average.

Still, this is a rather enjoyable and competently made late 80's horror movie.And here's a bit of trivia Cult actor Richard Lynch is known for his slightly disfigured facial features. These were the result of a horrible accident in the late 70's (I believe). Because of an LSD-trip gone bad, Mr. Lynch set himself on fire. Ironically, in Bad Dreams he plays a hippie-cult leader who sets himself, and his members... on fire. In the movie, however, he looks a little bit more 'burned up & crispy' then he does in real life.

Harris sometimes appearing to look normal or in other scenes looking like an undercooked barbecue spear rib keeps popping up with only Cynthia seeing him.

This all seems to be the ultimate power trip for Berrisford, That's if he can achieve it with the use of strong psychedelic drugs.It takes a while to get used to the constant flashbacks and psychic visions in the movie but when you start to get the hang of it you just go with the flow and don't get distracted by Harris and his constant surprise appearances, as a human being or a swiss crisp rib stake. There's a series of really gruesome, real and imaginary, scenes in the film that will shock you out of your seat, or skin. The real surprise in the film is saved for the final few minutes where Dr. Karman, finally realizing what's going on behind the scenes in the clinic, has it out with the crazed and determined psycho Dr. Berrisford, on top of the hospital roof. Both battle it out in a life and death struggle over the life and soul of a very spaced out and detached from reality Cynthia.

Unfortunately, while the filmmakers gave it a good try, the end results are somewhat bland and disappointing. For starters, the movie doesn't do a very good job setting up its heroine - we learn next to nothing about her that makes us care about her. With this in mind, combined with the fairly short running time (as well as some pivotal characters ending up having limited footage), this suggests that a lot of character development ended up on the cutting room floor. Despite this, there are also a number of really slow stretches here and there. As for the horror angle of the movie, I have to admit that I wasn't really creeped out at any moment - there is a contrived air to the moments of horror. Though I was somewhat uncomfortable about the fact that Richard Lynch's character is destroyed by a fire when Lynch in real life was severely burned in a real fire years earlier. I will say that for a low budget production, the movie is pretty well produced, looking slick and more expensive than it really was. It's too bad that the filmmakers' ability to squeeze every penny out of limited funds wasn't done with a better script. Though the fact that there are FIVE writers credited with coming up with this story should give an early warning to would-be viewers.

After being in a few sessions, she is able to recover her memories of what happened at the commune, which brings about a series of weird visions about Harris and her past. These convince her that he's back, which the staff doesn't believe her stories until a series of deaths strike the residents. Finally believing her story, they race to save her before Harris finds her.The Good News This is one of those late-80s slashers that holds up quite well. It's overly simplistic plot is one of it's best strengths, making it fly by pretty quickly without too much of a downtime. That is one of the best features, as it never overstays it's welcome. This does have a couple of genuinely intense moments, such as the flashback to the mass suicide, the hallucination sequence in the parking lot and the final kill has some great attempts at suspense as well. Also of note is the sheer ferocity of the killings. Each kill is even more mean-spirited than the last, and this is incredibly refreshing. There is nothing to stop this from spilling more blood along the way. The recurring images of the burning man always keeps a little gore in the film, and the kills do as well. There's a very brutal stabbing in the stomach with a pair of scalpels, a stabbing through the hand that is quite brutal and the best kill is the sucked into a turbine and splattered throughout the rest of the sanitarium. All in all, this was pretty decent.The Bad News One of the things with this film is that it bares so many similarities to the Nightmare on Elm Street films that it could very easily be in that series and not feel very out-of-place. The whole aspect of the sanitarium is right out of part 3, and much of the incidental aspects are there as well. It's all pretty obvious when it's viewed, so there's no real need to spill it out. There's also a few little scenes that really irked me. The sequence of Karmen's hallucination is one of the few scenes that really bugged me, as the classical scoring is a nice touch, although the irony is a bit heavy-handed and tips the scene into full-blown camp. The ending as well could fall here, which is just a mess overall. It's completely mind-boggling and throws away most of the rest of the film, changing it around entirely but there's no real explanation required to explain it away. It's one of the worst problems in the film.The Final Verdict This is pretty good, and it was quite surprising how much. This isn't a spectacular film that unfortunately got washed aside due to too many Nightmare on Elm Street similarities. It's not that bad and worthy of a watch, but don't be surprised if you find yourself sporting the influence game quite frequently.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and drug use "},{"Title":"Definite ELM STREET Clone Though Not Bad","Date":"26 August 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  BAD DREAMS is an okay horror that has a premise that pretty much tries to cash in on the Elm Street success.

A young cult member (Jennifer Rubin)is almost killed in a mass suicide.  She lays in a coma for several years, and when she awakens, she is plagued with images of the Cult Leader (Richard Lynch)reaching out for her from beyond the grave.  A totally unspectacular film that has only the always interesting Harris Yulin to recommend it.  The story is pedestrian, and the film is directed by Andrew Fleming, who would later bring us The Craft, in a wholly unimaginative manner.  A few last act surprises are thrown in at the end, but structurally they occur just where you'd expect them.  It is writing of the most formulaic variety.  The film was released in the era of A Nightmare on Elm Street, and the original ad campaign promoted the film as a new take off on that series.  And in some of the film's narrative conceits, you can spot the influence of those films. Yet, although this is more competent than that series was at its worst, even (or especially)the worst Elm Street film expressed more flailing ambition and memorable vulgarity than this very witless film ever comes close to.

The cast of the movie (with the exception of a couple roles) is excellent. Jennifer Rubin is brilliant as always in her portrayal of the awakening Cynthia, and Dean Cameron is nothing less than breath-taking as he switches back and forth from delusional psychopath to happy camper.The problem with this movie lay with the underlying storyline. As a 30-something woman having just awakened from a long coma, Jennifer Rubin is a little too young for the role. (Knocking a few years off the coma would have helped.) The viewer soon forgets that when they get caught up in the whirlwind of activities going on around. There's a little gore in some parts, but what's a good slice 'em and dice 'em up horror without a little gore?If you enjoy Jennifer Rubin in this movie, you may also want to check her out in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors (as well as the rest of the Freddy series), as well as a more serious role in the 1988 teen drama Permanent Record. Any Cameron movie is worth the watch, but for Dean at his peak, check out the hits Ski School and Summer School. The slow start doesn't hurt the movie at all, and the movie is worth at least a 7.2 on the ratings scale.

When she refuses, he starts to attack those around her.If you've seen A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors, then you're going to get a strong sense of deja-vu watching Bad Dreams with a horribly disfigured bogeyman who kills from beyond the grave, a group of mentally unstable people in an institution suffering inexplicably nasty fates, and Elm Street 3 actress Jennifer Rubin in the lead, the similarities are too obvious to ignore.After plenty of unexceptional Elm-street style death scenes, the film eventually attempts to distance itself from Wes Craven's iconic series by revealing its seemingly supernatural occurrences to be the result of mind-altering drugs dished out by an evil doctor; it's an ending that makes very little sense (precisely what the doctor is trying to achieve is unclear) and one which does nothing to alter the fact that this is a derivative horror at its most mediocre.4.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 5 for the spectacular fire scene at the beginning, which features some cool special effects and a few impressive burn stunts. "}{"Title":"Why is it that in horror movies, anytime someone finds blood dripping onto them from somewhere above their head, they always turn and look up without moving an inch to any side to get out of the way?","Date":"25 February 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  There is a blood dripping scene in Bad Dreams (one of the oldest tricks in the horror movie book but one which does not seem to ever diminish with each succeeding horror film, even up to today) that turns out to be probably the, um, chunkiest one that I've ever seen. Effective, I suppose, on a morbid level, since it avoids being nothing but a typical revelation of a brutally murdered body, but tiring in the way that it is executed (the scene, not the body, and no pun intended, of course). For some reason this reminds me of the scene in Joe Dirt where David Spade finds himself with a missile shaped septic tank strapped to his back, which ends up spewing its gooey contents onto his astonished head, and instead of attempting to prevent the sludge from bathing him from head to foot, he stands motionless, going `Wah! Wah! Wah!' and subjecting himself to the onslaught of the pasty substance. This is something that is easily avoided in real life (even if you DO somehow manage to wind up with a septic tank on your back), and the fact that Dirt makes not even the slightest attempt to avoid it reveals the scene as a weak effort to get a cheap laugh. Any blood-dripping scene in a horror film, similarly, is an equally weak effort to get a scare. In this case, a gross out scare, a brand which is inherently weak in itself.The blood-dripping scene in Bad Dreams strikes me, for the main reason, because the rest of the movie is not much of a horror film except for the occasional appearance of the cult leader from the beginning of the film turning up as a horribly burned corpse, haunting poor Cynthia, the lone survivor (as usual) of the tragic event at the beginning of the film. The movie starts off with one of those goofball cult meetings, where everyone decides to commit mass suicide in order to become one with each other, or some other such nonsense. It starts off by making a comment about the destructive power of stupid people in large groups, but then turns into this weird horror/thriller for the rest of the movie. There are a few effective scenes in the film, such as, ironically, the scene where Ralph, one of Cynthia's new roommates at the mental institution, tells her that whenever it gets to be too much for him, he just makes a little hole and it all goes away. He lifts up his shirt and reveals a map of scars traveling up his belly and chest, which is a huge turn from the horny teenage goofball that he had been portraying up to that point in the film (probably something that helped in getting him the role of Dave in the Ski School films of the early and mid 1990s, the films that he is probably best known for). But for the most part this is a pretty weak film.Bad Dreams fails as a horror film because not a single new idea can be found in the movie, which renders its horror content completely predictable and almost entirely without effect, and it fails as a thriller (although not as much as it fails as a horror film), because it crosses the thin line between horror and thriller, inserting too much gore and supernatural antagonism where it doesn't belong, and thereby coming off as campy at best. It is, however, more entertaining than other bad movies I've found in the horror section lately, such as Neon Maniacs, which has cemented itself as one of the worst horror films I've ever seen, and not even bad in that good way, like They Live or Texas Chainsaw or some of the Friday the 13th or Nightmare of Elm Street sequels. The tagline for Bad Dreams (the one on the top of the cover box, not the goofy `It's A Scream!' at the bottom) is a little interesting, in the way that it creates interest in the movie since you just have a natural urge to find out why someone would wish they were dead upon waking up (although this is also a pretty weak way create interest in a movie, especially a horror movie), but it also has nothing to do with the movie itself. Anytime a movie has a tagline that turns out to be a figure of speech, it tends to have the effect of leaving a bad aftertaste. The entirety of the suspense in the film, in fact, is derived from the fact that Cynthia does NOT wish she were dead upon awakening. The cult leader coming after her is the one that wishes she were dead, so if she really wished she was dead so badly all she had to do was give in and let him take her. This is, of course, not the case, and so we have a movie. But the strange thing about it is that, despite having almost no strengths at all, it makes me wonder if maybe horror films are SUPPOSED to be bad, at least to be memorable. This one wasn't all that terrible, but makes little to no impression. The acting is weak from everyone involved (even from the beautiful Jennifer Rubin, who strikes me as an actor who should have had a more visible career than she has had so far), and the directing is little more than pointing and shooting, but the movie is almost immediately forgettable. Maybe in swaying on the line between horror and thriller, Bad Dreams made the unfortunate mistake of landing right in that limbo zone between a truly great horror film and a truly awful one &#150; the zone of oblivion.

NOES 3 was a great movie so they completly copied the whole idea, switched around a little bit, and have a good movie.
