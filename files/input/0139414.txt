I love this dialog in a horror film. I got myself a copy on DVD and watch it at least a few times a year. There are some classic lines between the city folk vs. the bumpkins. Fonda's line about the sarcasm being too subtle is great (while spraying RAID in the middle of Maine). Betty White is building her career these days being the tart-mouthed old broad (see Boston Legal - another David Kelley production). Also, the interplay between Oliver Platt and the actor playing the sheriff are priceless.Contrary to what others have written - I think the special effects go just fine with the overall campy and comedy feel of the movie and the amount of gore is also appropriate. More would change the tone of the film from the comedy which I enjoy, to one more of a gross-out nature.Just a favorite of mine. Try it if you, for example, liked Love at First Bite - you will probably like this too.

Wealthy crocodile hunter Hector Cyr swoops in to insist that the creature is a crocodile.  A claim that looks increasingly likely when the body count begins to rise.You really need to be in the mood for a film like this or else you will likely hate it.  If you love Tremors then you might be the sort of person that lake Placid is aimed at.  The film's strength is that it is a big silly B-movie and it knows it. The film lets us know very early on that it is not 100% serious and this then frees us up to enjoy it rather than moaning about the sheer unlikelyness of the whole affair.The plot is daft of course, a Jaws rip off from opening sequence to final attack.  The fact that the script has a great sense of humour makes this OK &#150; so when an old woman feeds a cow to the croc then it's fine because that's just what you'd expect in this film.  Likewise the humour gives rise to plenty of funny lines which add to the feeling that the film is about fun more than scares.  `Is this the man who was attacked?' says Cyr, holding a toe found by the water `he seemed taller' replies the sheriff.  Of course at some point the ending must come and it is as overblown as you'd expect, but even then it has it's tongue in it's cheek (fishing with a cow!?).The crocodile effect is a mixed bag.  In some instances it is good while in others it is over animated and not realistic.  For the most part though it works well enough.  The cast are not that good but deliver wooden performances in a good way (if that's possible).  Platt steals every scene he is in by getting all the funny lines (`yeah well they conceal that sort of information in books' being a put down I fully intend to use given the chance).  Pullman is given a less glamorous task of being the leading man while Fonda is like Ally McBeal in the woods!  Gleeson is great fun bouncing off Platt and Betty White is so crazy that it's hard not to laugh!Overall this is a big budget silly B-movie that laughs at itself.  If you are not in the mood for that, or can't accept it for what it is then you'd do well to avoid this film.  For all others there is enough good lines and silly fun to be had here to help you enjoy it, even if you do forget it shortly after watching it.

So while you can sit there and try to pick out everything that's wrong with this movie, it's better just to sit back and enjoy it.

It's witty and never takes itself too seriously. The characters are all foils for one another, setting up some of the most entertaining dialog of any movie I know.The plot revolves around a 30 foot Asian crocodile somehow winding up in a lake in Maine - go figure. What makes the movie are the characters assembled to do something about it. Bridget Fonda is an annoying paleontologist who's never before ventured out of her museum. Here, she plays both the archetypal fish out of water as well as potential romantic interest for the local game warden, played by Bill Pullman. The essential characters are rounded out by Brendan Gleeson's dour sheriff, Oliver Platt's rich and eccentric mythology buff, and Betty White as the colorful local little old lady with a secret or two.As I said, reduced to a plot outline, it's pretty unimpressive, but the verbal barbs that fly back and forth between the characters are what make the show.

Absolutely devoid of any message, but chock full of absurd parody.Any movie that opens with a gruff county sheriff listening to I Think I Love You while he fishes can't be taken seriously. And it gets far goofier than that. The dialog is a relentless parade of one-liners between the five principals a paleontologist (Bridget Fonda), a Fish & Game guy (Bill Pullman), a croc-worshiping professor (Oliver Platt), the sheriff (Brendan Gleeson), and an eccentric hermit (Betty White). Oh, and of course, a big creature with a big attitude and a big appetite.Great character development; and all of the characters are over the top except maybe Pullman's, whose routine nice guy persona balances with the nuts. It's a toss-up who has the most joke lines or who delivers them with the most punch; as they reel off sarcasm at the speed of a machine gun. You can almost see the actors winking at the audience, and they obviously had fun making this. Even the monster (which usually looks real) performs like a seasoned comic. The only complaint to note is that once in a while the endless arguing may wear you out.The story, which utilizes subtle references to big creature movies like Jurassic Park and Jaws, actually manages to go somewhere. There are a few clever surprises, and the closing scene is rather unique.No cerebral activity will be necessary in the course of watching this movie. Just settle down with some popcorn, and get ready for some good comic idiocy.

The movie is so awful that it is funny.  I died laughing throughout the whole movie.  I was also rooting with the old lady for the crocs.

The whole plot was loose and had no major plot points.  However, the rest of the movie lacked any intelligence whatsoever, and it succeeded in being a good high-budget B-movie.Acting As bad as you can imagine.  No emotions or any real style.  It was pure camp.  If you don't like campy movies, then don't see this one. However, you die laughing because of the acting.Dialogue  Funny stuff.  It is not funny because of what was written most of the time, but because of the way it was written, and delivered.  The dialogue is pure camp and it is completely overboard.  Two of my favorite quotes are If I had a d!@#, I would tell you to suck it, and, I am rooting for the crocodile.

It wasn't a success, maybe due to the title - potential viewers may think it's a documentary about a lake - but is consistently humorous, thanks to a good cast. Fonda, as a paleontologist sent to investigate a sudden death by large teeth on the lake in question, is purposely irritating in the 'fish out of water' role. She reveals a surprising knack for comedy, the city girl from New Yawk stuck in the forest. Platt & Gleeson squabble like two long-lost overweight brothers as respectfully, eccentric millionaire & sheriff. Platt is always funny, and Gleeson matches him here. Pullman makes less of an impression, underplaying as the guy in charge. Betty White is a hoot as the foul-mouthed local old lady with a secret.The monster in question, a 30-foot croc, stays out of sight for the first half-hour and when it does appear, it's strangely unsurprising, despite the suddenness. It's as if we've seen so many of these 'large animal' pictures by this point, this is just another one in a long line. It's a weird money shot as well, involving a growling bear, and is not as effective as it should be. Thanks to modern special FX, computer and otherwise, the croc is better realized than those of 20 years earlier. But that could be a problem integrated into the wilderness like any other animal, there's nothing about the creature, despite its size, to inspire awe or real terror. It's just a big crocodile, after all. Like Anaconda, this inspired a slew of big croc & alligator movies for the Sci-Fi Channel.

If the attempts at joking around do not annoy you, then there is some fun to be had. There's a giant crocodile taking down a bear and a cow. The joking around keeps the tone relatively light. This is light weight B-horror movie and it knows it.

It does not take itself too seriously and neither should you. It is basically a comedy with a giant crocodile in it. Sure, there are some elements of horror and suspense but at its core this movie is about the interaction of the main characters and their almost constant bickering and one liners. The story is simple and does not drag out. A scientist gets killed in the beginning of the movie and a man from Fish & Wildlife as well as a paleontologist are sent to investigate. There is also the local sheriff who views city folks as annoying and sarcastic and completing the quartet is a wacky rich crocodile obsessed private citizen who tracks crocodiles and swims with them. They eventually discover that there is a crocodile in the lake and obviously there shouldn't be any crocodiles in Maine especially the monstrous 30 foot variety. After discovering it, the group is undecided as whether to try and capture it or kill it. Through the progress of the movie they also discover that an old widow has been keeping the crocodile as a pet and feeding it cows (and that her husband accidentally got eaten by the crocodile as well). Then they decide to try and capture it as it is a miracle of nature. The cast is great. Bill Pullman, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson and Bettie White all add something to the mix making the movie highly enjoyable. Even Bridget Fonda is good in her role as the city paleontologist. The effects are fine and at no time did I get distracted by any bad effects. What sets this movie apart from most monster/creature features is the fact that there is a very low human body count. Almost all of the characters survive. If I am not mistaken there is one casualty at the beginning, and one sheriffs deputy about halfway through. And that's it. In most other movies of this nature there is usually a bus load of victims and geysers of blood and gore. This is not the case here, sure there are a few gruesome scenes but these are minimal and to be expected when dealing with a man eating crocodile. The crocodile in the movie does not appear every time someone is in the water or near it. It's just a huge crocodile which does not kill everyone and anyone it comes into contact with. And on top of that the ending does not have the crocodile being killed by the one lone hero with a last round of ammo (as most of these type movies seem to). So even though this is a B-movie it's still great and much better than its sequels which got dumber and dumber. It is also much better than Primeval or Rogue both of which lack the humor that is apparent in this film. So I I highly recommend this humorous horror.

It is not your usual monster animal horror movie. Sure, there are heads bitten off and bloody bodies, but they take a back seat to the dialog. First, Bridget Fonda (Army of Darkness, Kiss of the Dragon) is a paleontologist from New York sent to the Maine backwoods. All the jokes about Maine and backwoods keep flying. It is a hoot!

One of the better elements here is the fact that this one manages to inject such a good amount of quality comedy into the proceedings that this doesn't make it feel like an attempt to copy the style of film at the time but more about a film that just happened to feature people who had a strong sense of humor. This makes it a lot more believable as a comedy than expected, as the physical gags and outstanding verbal jabs thrown at everyone makes it a lot more enjoyable than expected with the banter between everyone is brought out instead of being glossed over and forgotten, as everyone has a few good put-downs along with several really good one-liners. When it gets down to the horror elements, this one is outstanding as well with plenty of good fun to be had had here as the switch-over is handled in the right manner, as the film is serious when it needs to be and funny when seriousness has run its course. That seriousness starts with some fine stalking scenes including one where it backs a diver halfway across the lake as it floats on the surface waiting to attack or an underwater ambush in its lair that gets a good shock jump. Among other outstanding scenes is the high-action finale that ends this in great fashion as the chase through the lake finally ends with the exciting helicopter attack, the utterly fun manner of containing and trapping the creature as well as the final shock-jump that works nicely. As well, the few other attacks in here are quite fun as well as getting in some solid gore here, as it is pretty ample. Add in some great animatronics and CGI so seamless it looks like one monster throughout for the crocodile and this one is a fine creature feature.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and violence-against-animals.

And oh how I love it.","Date":"21 June 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" It is impossible to come out happy if you go into Lake Placid expecting a divine work of horror excellence. It is possible to go in expecting deliberately campy material and emerge pleasantly fulfilled. It's true; I have a thing for creature features, especially playful ones set in the present. Some I can develop a fondness for, some I can just smile or grin at.Recently, Piranha 3D and Piranha 3DD didn't do justice, I wasn't totally smitten with Eight Legged Freaks either, but I really found myself liking Anaconda for a number of reasons. While it's a lesser quality film, Lake Placid has some good things going for it. We are introduced to the dysfunctional police partners, Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) and Sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson), who are convinced there is something in the muddy waters of their Aroostook County Lake in Maine. After it eats Keough's partner, the ditzy, overly-paranoid New York City Paleontologist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) is called to investigate a mysterious tooth found in the man's corpse. It is identified as the tooth of a crocodile, and the gang later discovers the croc is over thirty feet in length, of Asian territory (how it manages to swim itself all the way to a modest lake in Maine is a mystery to me), and a frail old farmer (Betty White) claims she has fed the useless cattle to it for an upwards of six years. Another quibble I have; how have these bumbling sheriffs not heard this thing for six years? It roars, it creates rough currents, and I'm sure people fish in the lake from time to time. No man-eating croc encounters reported? Bringing logic to a creature feature is like bringing a TV dinner to a restaurant. It's unnecessary and embarrassing. You buy a ticket or rent the DVD to simply enjoy the experience, get a few laughs, and no harm is done. I can accept that, and the movie provides goofy fun, though, however, I will say the scenes featuring the croc are too few and far between. Its first appearance isn't until forty minutes in, and the film truly isn't working towards any suspense. It is just pacing around familiar territory.While the film is questionable on many levels, it does bring one thing to the table; a great cast of people who prove they can commit an act of lovable idiocy. Gleeson is definitely the star here, with his one-liners and presence so assisting as the comic relief, that my point is only furthered; we need a bit of Gleeson in every movie. Bill Pullman is welcomed here and so is Bridget Fonda. But, you can imagine, the scenes the croc is in, he is the show-stealer.Speaking of which, the effects on the croc itself are quite enjoyable too, while still presenting a nice elegance and respect for the creature feature sub-genre. It doesn't look too glossy or too arbitrarily unrealistic, either. I believe it is of an animatronic state, much like how the main anaconda was in Anaconda. The good thing about an animatronic effect is that manipulation to the creation can be done, while still occupying some realism. An example would be when Owen Wilson was swallowed whole by the snake in Anaconda. It looked a little faulty, but still, wasn't disgustingly CGI.Lake Placid's conclusion is the one factor that I was simply won over by. It's bombastic finale that truly cements what this type of movie was meant for. It, again, reminds me of the engaging final act in Anaconda, which I dare not spoil. The whole film, itself, is one location shot, one bickering shot, one creature shot, and one halfway tense shot after another. And oh how I love it.Starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Brendan Gleeson, and Betty White. Directed by Steve Miner.

Brendon Gleeson will never be forgotten for his role in BRAVEHEART just as the movie will never be forgotten. So here I have got 4 of the greatest titles, bring the star cast together mix and match and wallah you have got LAKE PLACID. Once again a movie that is over a decade old and yet a movie that is entertaining and a movie that is great for a production dated to 1999. Every movie with creatures and monsters look like a drawing done by a juvenile using windows movie maker if you compared it with the Spielberg hit JURRASIC PARK. So let not compare shall we?In the small town Maine, there has been a horrific accident. Sheriff Hank (Brendon Gleeson) pulls out his friend out of the waters of a lake (Supposedly called Lake Placid but it's not since the name is already taken) completely devoured waist down. Chief Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) of Maine Fish and Game is called in to take a look to find out what is in the waters. Far from main in the city of New York in a museum paleontologist Kelly (Bridget Fonda) has been replaced by her boyfriend aka dropped like its hot! She is then sent out to main to examine a tooth that looks pre historic which is pulled out from the lake victim mentioned before. Kelly confirms the tooth is not a fossil and whatever creature the tooth belonged to is live and very much swimming in the Lake. Heated arguments with Sheriff Hank and Chief Jack and as usual the woman wins! She ends up heading out with them to camp in the forest for 2 days in an expedition to find the cause of all the deaths. Camping for New Yorker even in the late 90s meant a hotel or an inn with a toilet and most certainly not tents. The entire party is soon joined by rich man Hector (Oliver Platt) who has a thing to swim with the crocodiles!Evenly distributed between scary and hilarious LAKE PLACID is a sure fire hour and a half of entertainment. Director Steve Miner who is an ace with TV direction does a very smart job on the production. A very well positioned directorial where the Horror &#x96; Com genre is exposed with clarity. There is very wise use of the talents of the cast. Especially those of Platt and Gleeson, Those who have seen the works of them know the potential they carry for subtle humor and yet have the persona to pull through a scary thriller. There is not a chance in hell that a viewer would walk away on this movie disappointed. Please respect that this was done in 1999 with the technology available over the decade. Comparison to it with the times of today would of course make it look a shame if not. Are you planning on kicking back and having some alone time or just relaxing with some friends indoors during the scorching hot and madly humid summer? Especially when the cinemas are sucked dry out of entertainment.

The two right away don't see eye to eye with Kelly in what's going on or in the lake. Kelly feels that both Wells & Keoguh are a big turned off in Kelly, a big city girl with a collage PHD, in her hampering their instigation. It's both Wells & Keough feel that she doesn't know squat, by never going outside of New York City limits, about the great outdoors despite her being an expert on wildlife in and out of the water.It soon becomes apparent that there's something very dangerous lurking in the lake after a second attack happened where a deputy sheriff ended up getting decapitated when boat that Wells Kelly and Sheriff Keough was riding on looking for whatever was committing these atrocities was almost capsize. It's that's the nutty Mythology Professor Hector Cyr, Oliver Platt, was called in to help in the investigation. It soon becomes evident,after an attacking grizzly bear was attacked and dragged into the lake, what what's killing off the people and wildlife in the area is A monster size over 30 foot long and up to four ton Asiatic salt water crocodile! The crocodile somehow swam thousands of miles and ended up in the re-named Lake Black,formerly Lake Placid, through underwater channels connecting the lake to the Atlantic Ocean! It also becomes very apparent that professor Cry a crocodile lover who feels that crocodiles are the highest and most noble form of life on earth is going to do everything in his power, even risk his as well as anyone else's lives,to save the monster crocodile from extinction!***SPOILERS*** As we soon learn it's old lady Delores Bickerman,Betty White, who's really behind all this carnage in and around the lake. Mrs Brickerman has for some seven years been feeding the monster crocodile the livestock on her farm as well as keeping from the police the truth of the disappearance of her husband Berney who in fact was one of her favorite pet's-the crocodile-first meals or victims! With the truth about the monster crocodile now out in the open it's decided to kill the thing by sending in the entire state Fish & Game Department and well as all the law enforcement personnel within 50 miles of the lake where the beast resides. But as expected it's the nutty Professor Hector Cyr who's love for the monster crocodile exceeds his own as well as anyone on else lives does everything his his power to keep that from happening.Exciting final with the big showdown between man and beast at Black Lake with very unexpected and at the same time, for Hector Cyr, satisfying results. It's then that we in the audience as well as both Sheriff Keough and Fish & Game Warden and Forest Ranger Wells see just how right Hector was in keeping the killer crocodile alive! Not for just farther scientific studies but, with the film Lake Placid grossing almost 60 million dollars worldwide, for up until now two and even a third future sequel!

She meets up with the level headed Game and Fish rep, the surly local cop, and a very eccentric millionaire who's completely smitten with all things Crocodile. All come together to solve the mystery of how a creature like this would end up in Lake Placid, and also to capture and/or eliminate this dangerous threat to the fauna surrounding the Lake, especially the human population. The CGI effects are quite good here, and there's a neat little ending that had my six year old nephew so shocked he accidentally blurted out What the f**k was that?

So in come the local police, led by Bill Pullman, a stuck-up paleontologist (beautiful and charming Bridget Fonda hams it up)and an eccentric crocodile-obsessed man (awesome Oliver Platt) to investigate the scene. What follows is the uncovering of a hysterical story involving an Asian Pacific crocodile that has migrated into Black Lake from the ocean, and doesn't plan to leave.Mrs. Bickerman (Betty White, who will make your jaw drop with her side-splitting, show stealing performance) has been protecting the croc and feeding it cows in the lake. Now the rescue squad must find a way to excavate the crocodile from the area without being eaten alive in the process. With as much genuine scares as there are laughs, this thriller works enormously well as long as you keep in mind that it's all for fun. The crocodile looks amazing.

If you look at the reviews, you will notice that the people who hated it, hated it a lot, and the people who liked it, loved it and raved about it.  I am of the latter group.  I tell everyone to rent this movie, some like it, some don't.  A very simple test to see if you will like this movie is this. Did you see the either of the first two House movies? Did you like them?If you answered yes to both questions, you will absolutely love this movie.  Steve Miner, who directed the original House, directed Lake Placid.  He has a great sensibility for horror/comedy, and it certainly shows in this movie.  Seriously, whatever anyone says doesn't really matter.  I love this film, and I don't see why anyone wouldn't like it.  It seems that most people that don't get it, consider it a poorly made horror movie.  While, the truth is, this is an expertly made comedy film.  Go rent it for yourself, you won't regret it.  I promise.

When she gets there she meets a frustrated county sheriff named Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson) and a puzzled ranger from the Department of Fish and Wildlife who goes by the name of Jack Wells (Bill Pullman). Not only do they not understand why Kelly has been sent but neither of them thinks she belongs with them on this dangerous mission which has already resulted in the death of at least one person. However, they are in for an even bigger surprise when a rich but extremely eccentric crocodile hunter named Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt) shows up unexpectedly. Anyway, rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this film turned out to be somewhat entertaining all things considered. I liked the mix of characters and I thought all of the actors did a fine job. I also liked the special effects and I thought the giant crocodile was certainly better than those displayed in some of the other films involving similar creatures. However, the humor wasn't nearly as fine as it could have been and the inter-relationship between Jack and Kelly lacked passion. All in all this wasn't a bad movie and I rate it as about average.

Full of ridiculous characters, gory killings, and a cameo from Betty White in which she swears not like one but several sailors, it paved the way for today's fun B-movies in the vein of Sharknado and pretty much any film in the Asylum catalog. A group of investigators are called to a remote lake in Maine after the mysterious death of a police officer occurs in the usually calm waters. Upon arriving, the team discovers that a crocodile has somehow made its way into the lake and is feeding on anything big enough to satisfy its appetite... whether it be animal or human. Where did the beast come from and how can they stop it before it kills again?Lake Placid boasts an ensemble cast of actors who looking back now would consider this slumming it by how they're viewed today. Bill Pullman portrays one of the crocodile hunters and puts forth every effort to take the material seriously. Bridget Fonda is a paleontologist who delivers an emotional performance completely unnecessary for such a lighthearted adventure romp. Brendan Gleeson plays the local sheriff and you'd never know he would grow into such a respected British thespian of cinema. Oliver Platt fully embraces his role as an eccentric rich boy obsessed with the oversized scaly lizards.Lake Placid is rated R for violent creature attacks and related gore, and for language. There's no nudity but plenty of conversations about sex and innuendos. If you have a weak stomach when it comes to on screen carnage, you might find yourself hurrying to close your eyes at points. Clocking in at an hour and twenty-two minutes, Lake Placid is a great example of the term less is more. It doesn't overstay its welcome and accomplishes what it wants to within its run time. I think its legacy of made-for-TV sequels speaks for its appeal to monster movie enthusiasts who enjoy a little humor and cheese with their severed limbs and decapitated heads.

It's actually plain good. A successful B-movie. Yes, while Lake Placid may be across the board inferior in many movie aspects, it makes up for its lesser qualities with a gnarly and capturing, very well-streamed plot line. The 30ft. croc is always lurking. It's a well edited and shot movie. Lake Placid thrives on the characters battling the 30ft. croc. Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, Brendon Gleeson and Oliver Platt together comprise the good, strong cast. Bridget Fonda stars as the lead. Bridget is so, girl next door, really hot. She plays Scott a little on the intense side, but her guarded personality is really appealing. She does a fine job. Bill Pullman possesses a masterful acting skill for B-movies. He's really excellent and he's really appreciated as Jack Wells. Brendon Gleeson brings his strong presence to his character. He plays Sheriff Hank Keough nearly too well, almost taking from Placid's B-movie nostalgia with his chiseled acting skills. Oliver Platt really makes the movie, supplying a good dynamic with Hector Cyr, some kinda wild crocodile hunting cowboy. Platt has such an affectionate persona. Betty White is funny as the wacky old cuck feeding the 30ft. crocodile as a pet. Lake Placid is a good horror in the sense it's a light horror. The gory parts are presently lucidly in counterbalance, nicely done. At some point in time, Lake Placid's well worth watching. It's such a good B-movie, it's an A-movie.

Betty White, in particular (a woman known- and revered- for her love of animals), was brilliant as the 'gator-feeding granny-type. I agree with the reviewer who felt that the cheesy cgi were in keeping with the overall tone of the movie. (Here's a quick real-life horror story for you I was driving a cab one night and had picked up a fare- a couple from Virginia- and we were at a stoplight just across the street from the Screen Gems studios. Beside the studio is a road about a block long that curves into the woods and dead-ends in a swamp. I was watching the light, waiting for it to change, when both of my back-seat passengers leaned forward. I looked at them and they were staring straight ahead, just beyond the intersection where the light was. That's the biggest dog I've ever seen in my life, the guy whispered. I looked. That's not a dog, I corrected That's an alligator. The 'gator we were staring at had risen up and was walking slowly from the studio side of the street to the far side. It was so big that it's snout was on one side of the road and the tip of its tail on the other. The light changed, but I didn't drive off we sat there and watched that present-day dinosaur slowly move across the road and into the weeds on the far side. I joked that I was going to have to charge them extra for the show, but I've had more than one encounter with alligators hereabouts and I know just how scary the real thing(s) can be. Not long after the incident, I had to make a hasty pit-stop one night- any port in a storm- and found myself on that darkened road taking care of business when I heard, very distinctly, the sound of something very large moving very stealthily through the surrounding forest. I hopped back in my cab- after carefully doublechecking underneath for signs of saurians- and took off. In one front-page, top story of the night on the news, a 'gator was feeding off of cats in a local neighborhood. In another, a 'gator stopped traffic on a bridge in mid-day. Yet another 'gator was shown on the beach, leading some to speculate that some of the shark attacks reported nearly every summer hereabouts, now, might be the work of alligators. I picked up a workman working on a local bridge one day when his entire crew was sent home because they were wading through waist-deep water that turned out to be literally crawling with hungry 'gators.

In this case we have a giant Asian crocodile claiming a Maine-lake as his own and, immediately after eating his first victim (a diver whom he bit in half), a team of weirdo-specialists gathers around the lake to investigate the creature. Everyone slightly familiar with this type of insignificant horror films knows that they're a lot more comical than they are scary, thus Like Placid is a large buffet of witty dialogues, eccentric characters and over-the-top special effects. The characters are constantly arguing and throwing insults at each other and – unlike in many other nowadays creature features – it works and this film really qualifies as good, brainless amusement. Especially the interactions between the local, lesser intelligent, Sheriff Brendan Gleeson and the wealthy professional croc-hunter Oliver Platt often make you chuckle. There are a few very grotesque (but ingenious) twists in the second half of the film and I really enjoyed the visual effects (ever seen a crocodile battle a bear?). This is director Steve Minor's first experiment in the monster-movie field, after a whole lot of slashers like Friday the 13th and Halloween sequels, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's looking for 80 minutes of pure amusement.Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence and Profanity.

Never one for the accolades of filmic awards, or to grace the top ten of critics columns it nevertheless delivers on the most important of audience expectations - entertainment. A stellar cast produce memorable, if not technically outstanding, performances, for no more reason than their unique character-led perspectives and ideals that are wrapped up in ever-increasingly conflicting dialogue. The sarcasm flows with almost non-stop regularity, and the 'fun' of this movie is as much to be found in seeing how the characters overcome their differences with each other, as with the 'will they or won't they' capturing of the crocodile. Lake Placid won't stretch your grey matter any, and it surely won't give you anything perplexing to debate after dinner, but it will leave you smirking from ear to ear, and recounting some marvellous one-liners to entertain your more cinematically reticent friends with.

However, Betty White steals the show as the keeper of the crocodile, who, unbeknownst to everyone until about halfway through the movie, has been feeding Mr. Croc a steady diet of her livestock. She hasn't been this funny since Match Game was in its prime. If you like shock value, Lake Placid has that too the scene in which the croc takes down, drags a huge black bear into the water and kills it is probably the BEST scene in the history of giant crocodile movies. My only complaint -- and I didn't realize this until I saw the cast list recently -- is that the beautiful Mariska Hargitay has a bit role in this movie (I am, sadly, assuming she got eaten early on). Mariska should have gotten the lead role in this movie (I think this was made right before she landed her role on Law & Order SVU) over Bridget Fonda, who just didn't seem like she was that into it. Fonda is better in more serious movies like A Simple Plan, which was the last movie she had been in prior to Lake Placid.

However the star of the show is Oliver Platt who plays an obsessed and very sarcastic scientist. The four set out to solve the mystery with what I can only call hilairious results. The Crocodile when he appears is convincing enough and at times is rather scary. The acting is surprisingly good for this kind of movie but then again its a surprisingly good cast. The film runs at a mere 82min and that is without a doubt a problem as the crocodile only features strongly for about the last half hour. Looking back on 1999 it was a good year for monster movies with the equally enjoyable Deep Blue Sea also released.

Writer Kelley has fashioned an unbelievably lazy script full of unanswered questions and illogic, choosing instead to pepper the dialogue constantly with sarcastic and witty remarks. Viewers' tolerance for his type of writing will dictate how much enjoyment is to be had with the film. Those expecting a straightforward and tense film, will be let down by the almost light atmosphere as the characters bicker, debate and snipe at one another. Those who embrace his quirky, nearly surreal approach to things will doubtlessly find much to love here. In either case, the story rarely makes sense and often doesn't even try to! How a creature like that exists (especially in that location) is glossed over and why it suddenly chooses to eat everyone, even when it's being fed regularly, is never touched on. The setting and the story are nothing more than a backdrop for the main cast to flap their gums even more than the beast. Pullman gives a fairly subtle, appealing performance and has little to do, really, except react to those around him. Fonda actually manages to incorporate a moderate amount of appeal into her grating character who has a penchant for falling out of vehicles and getting heads thrown at her. Gleeson gives the most affable and believable performance. The audience is invested in his well-being which is more than can be said for Platt. Sporting a ridiculous hairdo and a porcine physique, he's about the last person one would expect to see as a crocodile hunter. It's a real shame that lovely and bright Salenger (as a deputy) is forced to interact with and appear to be romantically interested in this ass. (Salenger, as a matter of fact, is even far more appealing than Fonda and could have played the leading female role quite well.) White steals the show in a tiny part laced with several shocking epithets, but her character makes no sense. SPOILER Why would she protect a creature that killed her husband, especially when it's killing other humans and is robbing her of her livestock? It makes no sense as presented here. All this isn't to say that there aren't some enjoyable aspects to the movie (and it's mercifully brief!), but even a movie with snappy dialogue ought to make some sort of sense at it's origin. The finished product here feels half-baked at best.

Lake Placid is a lesser example of that triumph. This could have been Mosquito or Orca, but is a moderately fun B movie. Brendan Gleason(Braveheart, Dark Blue), Oliver Platt(The Three Musketeers, Dangerous Beauty), and Bill Pullman(Ruthless People, The Last Seduction) have a ball tossing dry insults, although Platt is miscast. Betty White is one feisty and foul mouthed lady, while Bridget Fonda lands the doomed Capshaw role. David E. Kelley's script, while not featuring any dancing babies, is light. The movie is padded at 82 minutes. Adam Arkin is completely wasted in a lifeless subplot. Miner does do a good job of limiting the lacking effects, most effects shots are bad but quick. It is only the humor that saves this movie.Hector(Holding a severed toe) Is this your friend? Sheriff He seemed taller.

But feed one little cow to a crocodile...","Date":"27 July 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" - Some people may question my sanity for this one, but I'm a fan of Lake Placid. As a fluff-filled, popcorn movie, it's one of the more entertaining ones I've seen. If you're looking for a movie to answer the questions of life or provide you with something to think about for days after the movie ends, Lake Placid is not your film. But if you're looking for a movie to have fun with, I have no hesitation about recommending it.- Lake Placid is a mix of movie genres &#150; it's one part comedy, an almost equal part adventure, a dash horror, and a hint of romance. The comedy is good. The action is okay in that Saturday-afternoon-matinée kind of way. The horror consists mainly of cheap, but very effective, jump scares. And what little romance the movie has, unfortunately, is nauseating. But Lake Placid works because it never takes itself too seriously, which is a good thing. Instead of playing it straight, it's played for laughs and most of them work. Some of the dialogue makes me laugh out loud regardless of how many times I've seen it. Betty White steals every scene in which she appears. She has that mild-mannered persona and could easily pass for anyone's grandmother. But when push comes to shove, she lets the foul language rip without a second thought. It's hysterical. I've never been much of a fan of David E. Kelley, but he hit a home run with this witty, intelligent script.- Two of the relationships in the movie bear mentioning. The first is Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda. This is one of those typical fish-out-of-water-falls-for-the-local-guy relationships that are very common in a lot of the romantic/comedies that I've seen. It's really nothing special and incredibly predictable. The second is Oliver Platt and Brendan Gleeson. This is where Lake Placid rises above your standard comedy. These two guys are a riot when on screen together. Their constant bickering is a real treat. It's great.

Most of the characters come across as appealing, decent people caught in a bizarre situation. They react in believable ways to unbelievable events, with two exceptions 1)Oliver Platt's crocodile groupie. The character is a complete flake, but Platt fleshes him out as a funny and self-aware entity who is a lot of fun to watch and listen to...and the character finally has a flash of common sense an hour into the movie. 2) Similarly, Betty White has a semi-cameo as the most eccentric/lunatic grandma in Maine, but she is only a little bit more oddball than any 'real' senior citizen might be in a similar situation.Pretty much everyone strikes the right tone in this movie and gives a good-to-great performance, but Brendon Gleeson (as the sheriff) makes the movie for me. He gets most of the best lines, and delivers them with the sullen, deadpan, passive-aggressive panache of a born pain-in-the-butt. His character is insulted, pushed around and put-upon something awful in the course of the movie, and he does a wonderful slow burn. IMO, it's the most overlooked comic performance of that movie year.Aside geez, Gleeson is an ACTOR. You'd never think that the guy who plays this character would also be great in a visceral adventure/horror film like 28 Days Later. He was also one of best things about Troy as Helen's cuckolded husband, who duels Paris (Orlando Bloom) and kicks seven varieties of snot out of him in a towering rage. Gleeson comes across as one big, mean, scary butt-kicker, and he makes Paris/Orlando look like a sniveling little girly-man in comparison. Talk about range and versatility...! From now on, I intend to see any movie with Gleeson in a featured role; he's that good. Anyway, the movie is good, mean fun, with a nice sense of proportion. It laughs with the characters, and not at them. There is a winking acknowledgment of the fact that people are stupid and no damned good...but they still try their best, and their humanity is both endearing and infuriating.

You can't TRY to be campy. Camp has to come naturally. If Ed Wood had TRIED to make Plan 9 bad, it wouldn't be so enjoyable; it'd just be BAD. That's what's wrong with Lake Placid. A bunch of big names hamming it up, spouting smarmy, self-referencing and self-parodying dialogue. This film was so lousy, I couldn't even root for the crocodile.Of the entire cast, there is one bright spot. Brendan Gleeson plays the Sheriff with more character and depth than you'll find in the rest of the cast, combined. He succeeds in being entertaining because his character is taking the movie seriously, so his 'funny' lines have actual comedic impact.Contrast this to Betty White. An old lady who swears? Wow! I love this movie! That's such a fresh, cutting-edge idea! This might be funny to a few eight-year-olds, I guess, and maybe that's the audience this movie was aimed at.I think even an 8-year-old, though, would have balked at the presence of an Asian saltwater crocodile swimming across the Atlantic and setting up housekeeping in upper North America. Even if it COULD make the 6000-mile trip, why WOULD it? So it could spend eight months out of the year hibernating in the frigid mud?The writers were very clever in convincing the audience on the reason WHY the crocodile made the trip they dodged the question. Every time someone in the movie brings asks WHY?, the response is just a comment on how it COULD possibly happen, and isn't it amazing that it DID? If that's all the better they can come up with, they should have just used the old 'escaped pet gets huge' schtick. Even THAT would have improved this waste of film.This movie gets a 3 out of 10 (I gave one point for the crocodile animation and two points for Brendan Gleeson).

Lake Placid takes place in a small town in Maine. While out tagging beavers the sheriff Hank Krough, played by Brendan Gleeson, witnesses one of his deputies bitten completely in half by some unknown animal in Black Lake.  Kelly Scott, a paleontologist from a museum in New York City, played by Bridget Fonda, is sent down to Main to help in the investigation and to analyze a large tooth that was found in the deputies severed body.  Kelly and the sheriff then join up with Jack Wells, played by Bill Pullman, who is an officer from Maine's Fish and Game Department. The three then proceed to Black Lake to hunt down the beast that is responsible for the deputy's death.  Along the way they interview Mrs. Bickerman, played by the `Golden Girl' Betty White.  When asked about her husband she informs them that he was sick and he asked her to kill him.  She says that she hit him with a frying pan and buried him under the bulk head outside.  They are then joined by Hector Cyr, a mythology professor who has a fascination with crocodiles, played by Oliver Platt.  Hector is the only one who is convinced that there is a crocodile in Lake Black.  While out camping the three are nearly attacked by a large bear, but to their surprise they are saved when an enormous crocodile comes out of the lake and eats the bear.  This is when the non-believers finally come to realize that there is a crocodile that some how managed to inhabit the lake.  While out scouting the lake for the animal they witness Mrs. Bickerman leading one of her cows the lake blind folded, apparently as lunch for the large crocodile.  They then return to Mrs. Bickerman's house to pay her another visit.  Come to find out she had been feeding this creature for years.  During the creatures feeding time her husband was accidentally eaten.  Mrs. Bickerman never reported the incident because she feared that they would hunt the animal down and kill it. Eventually the crocodile is taken alive during a scenario that involves a cow dangling from a helicopter on a rope. All though many critics have not given this movie very good reviews, it has become my experience that if critics say it's a bad movie I will usually enjoy it. For instance, Jim Eadon and his uneducated independent movie review referred to the movie as a `croc film', but he didn't mean this in a nice way. He referred to the movies as a `croc of s***'. Which I must say is a pretty lame joke, but that is what I will use when I make a reference to his review.  His complaints range from problems with the title to the CGI. He also complained that the crocodile didn't eat enough people and referred to Betty White as a `sitcom hag' who he wanted the crocodile to eat. Well Mr. Jim Eadon, she has a hell of a lot more money and prestige than you will ever see, so don't screw with the `Golden Girls'. The movie did have its faults, as with any movie.  For instance, the name of the movie is `Lake Placid' but the actual name of the lake in the movie is Lake Black.  Other than that I thought the movie was pretty damn good. It has a good variety of horror and comedy all wrapped up in one movie. If you want to see a movie where people are continuously getting eaten, chewed up and spit out, go see `Deep Blue Sea', `Jaws', or one of those ridiculous `Nightmare on Elm Street' movies where Feddy keeps terrorizing and slicing up little children. Despite all the bad reviews, I would recommend this movie.  Again, I thought it was funny and had a good mix of comedy and horror, but who am I to say, I am just another uneducated person doing an independent movie review.

It is not a great film, nor does it ever try to be one.  It is laced with subtle and not-so-subtle humour.  It has some great action-packed sequences filled with suspense and packing more than a few scares.  It has some inventive special effects.  It has some good, comfortable character acting, and its acting leads are if not too interesting at least not offensive to the eyes.  It does, however, also possess a simple-minded, formulaic script which tries to throw some curve balls but ultimately fails.  It has some cheesy dialogue, and acting that is nothing more than one dimensional.  Notwithstanding these defects, Lake Placid is fun.  The story centers around a small lake in New England(Maine) of all places that houses a gigantic croc that starts to devour people in bits.  To the rescue come Brandon Gleeson as the sheriff, Bill Pullman as a wild game expert, Bridget Fonda as a dino expert, and Oliver Platt as an independent professor of crocology.  All these actors play through their parts with fun, Platt seeming to have the most fun hamming it up and Gleeson doing the best acting job.  Pullman and Fonda are pretty much just scenery.  For me, and other reviewers have commented on this, the worst part of the film was seeing Betty White use profanity really in what seemed a strained and forced manner.  It did nothing for me nor did i find it humorous.  Lake Placid, however, had funny moments, and scary ones too.  It will certainly take a bite out a boring evening!

The movie is NOT serious and has many suspenseful scenes packed into it's VERY brief running time. The cast are delightful and the big nasty croc is actually quite sympathetic at the end. Buy this DVD and enjoy for what it is...a light, breezy comedy-thriller that nails the bullseye instead of aiming for higher (and ultimately lesser) results.Fox may well re-release this movie on DVD with an anamorphic picture and DTS sound.

Welcome, then, Lake Placid, or not it's actually Lake Something Else, as one of the characters reveals in a baffling piece of exposition, thereby introducing at least one -- well, all right, the only one -- element of originality in the piece. (This could be a whole new trend characters having on-screen discussions about why the title of the film they're in doesn't actually have anything to do with the film they're in.) Which more or less sums up the cast's attitude most of the time, they'd rather be in Philadelphia. And it shows.  The script (though that's rather to over-value the backs of envelopes upon which the dialogue was penned) is textbook stuff -- textbooks on How Not To Write For The Movies. Unable to sustain a single coherent thought, let alone mood, it strives for effect in the deployment of obscenities that're neither funny nor valid (given her advanced years, one would've expected Betty White to have grown up by now). As to the plot, well, if you must have a film whose title is wrong to begin with, you might as well have a sheriff who upon being told by a murderer where the body is hidden promptly goes off and. . . does nothing about it. Or how about a crocodile that's mysteriously arrived in Maine with neither explanation nor back-story? Come to that, how about film editing which results in Fonda's museum fossil hunter joining the monster hunt but then -- presumably -- leaves on the cutting room floor all the explanatory stuff that justifies why, at the beginning of the movie, everyone's talking about A Very Old Tooth. . . and then never refers to it again? Like Fonda's acting ability, where did all the prehistoric stuff go???) Laugh? Well if that's not funny, how about extended intervals of obscene language from most of the members of the cast followed by the Sheriff doing pratfalls down holes, up in the air, that sort of thing. Gosh though, this is REALLY funny! Truth to tell, it ain't. It's risible and it's offensive, a foul-mouthed essay in juvenilia not even redeemed by reasonably good special effects. If this is what American film entertainment has come to -- forget plot, dialogue, characters, exposition, acting, editing and direction substitute instead SFX and gutter language -- then the industry's in worse shape than any of us previously thought. So Lake Placid. Though it's unlikely to have devoured the careers of Fonda and Pullman, it's certainly demeaned them. A pity that the audience is demeaned along with 'em.

Lake Placid is written by David E. Kelly, master of quirkiness, is loaded with likeable characters, each with his/her own arsenal of scathing sarcastic come-backs and wraps up with a straight-forward life's little lesson about ecological preservation and stuff. Hell, it even runs about the same length as your average episode of Friends. I was almost expecting commercial breaks to interrupt the crock-attacks and the snappish (sorry, David) repertoire of the characters.But luckily I'm going to compare it to a good Jim Burrows-directed sitcom, meaning it's a whole lot of fun to watch. OK, so it's no Jaws in the suspense department, despite the underwater kicking feet-shot being used one time to many. But luckily it's no Anaconda in the cheese department either, thanks to a believable giant croc (good ole Stan the Man) and keeping the CGI-scenes to a minimum (nothing beats old-fashioned animatronics) or so fast you barely have time to count the pixels (poor teddy!!!). Characters are all decidedly quirky, as one could expect from the pen of Mr. Kelly (except maybe for poor Bill Pullman, whose more the strong, silent type than the ascerbic comedian). Dialogue is sharp and witty, although I have to agree the forced profanity does seem a little out of place in the sitcom-like setting. Watching Betty White uttering a line about sucking certain appendages with a face as straight as Eastwood in some cop-movie, is rather a schock to the system (even Beau Arthur would've been left speechless). What troubled me (sorry again, David) however, was the fact that the characters (note, not the actors) seemed to be having fun instead of being a tad distressed by the predicament they were in. So what if there is a giant croc in the lake, I've got a one-liner lined up for just this situation and I'm going the let it fly, come hell or big teeth!!!But minor gripes aside, Lake Placid was not so bad as all the reviews made it out to be. Some tense moments and a healthy dollop of gore, even though the body count is phenomenally low for a monster movie. Nice croc action scenes and some lovely one-liners to remember and use in future (the bit with the severed toe...giggle). Lake Placid does however suffer from a rather lame storyline which didn't turn out to be the witty satire on monster movies the hype promised. The creature-feature equivalent of Scream it definitely ain't. But if you like your sitcoms laden with wit and kookiness, Lake Placid might just be an enjoyable experience.

Otherwise, this silly tale of a giant crocodile inexplicably hidden under the depths of a Maine lake (named, for no apparent reason, Black Lake, not Placid) registers poorly on both the fright and the laugh meters.  After a man is half-devoured by an unseen creature of the deep, a team of investigators heads out to solve the mystery and eradicate the problem.  Knowing that such a plot premise would undoubtedly elicit more howls of laughter than howls of fear, the filmmakers obviously decided to beat the scoffers to the punch line and chose, therefore, to frame the film within the context of a comedy rather than a straight horror film.  I doubt `Lake Placid' would have been a very effective film in either tonal mode, but the endless stream of sarcastic quips, `clever' asides and witless one-liners emanating from the mouths of the characters does become a bit wearying after about the first admittedly amusing ten or fifteen minutes of the film.In a similar vein, the characters  (played by Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt among others) come across as clever and likable in their early scenes but soon grow irritating in their repetitious flippancy and whininess.  Betty White, as a foul-mouthed local resident, likewise falls victim to this pattern.  The one-note script soon becomes grating and, with the humor rendered ineffective, all we are left with is a highly incredible, not very terrifying tale.  There's not much to say about `Lake Placid' except to verify conclusively that a horror/comedy without either horror or comedy has pretty much doomed itself to the video recycle bin for all eternity.

I am a fan of both these artistes, but they seemed lost in this film, as though it was down to them to explore their characters and relationship. I've never been to Maine, but if all the female police deputies look like this I may well turn to crime!But this film is nevertheless good popcorn entertainment. Good effects, some great one-liners and moments of shocking (but not explicit) violence add to a satisfactory 2 hours' viewing. But if you can only see one of these spoof-JAWS clones, save your pennies for DEEP BLUE SEA!

Often people will argue that some of the most infamous B-films were actually brilliant tongue-in-cheek commentary.  Lake Placid is the latest film to fit into that circle, as critics everywhere have been giving it glowing reviews, claiming that the ridiculous premise was actually part of a big joke. The film Lake Placid actually has nothing to do with the real Lake Placid, except for the fact that the Maine-lake this monstrous reptile lurks in was once to be called that, however the name was already taken. Bull Pullman is a park ranger and Bridget Fonda is a museum curator (specializing in fossils) who embark on a journey to find out what creature cut a man in two.  Of course that creature is a giant crocodile, loose in the lake and eating everything in sight.Lake Placid offers all of the standard gimmicks that usually fuel a plot like this.  Pullman is the quiet, macho hero.  Fonda is the city dwelling, mosquito hating female lead.  And of course Oliver Platt is the croc-loving guru battling Brendan Gleeson's cantankerous sheriff. Fans say that the cliche's that run amok in this film were put there on purpose.  I would agree with that, but something tells me that the makers of Lake Placid switched gears somewhere early on in the making of this picture, and their uncertainty shows.  As a spoof it simply doesn't fly. Betty White as the foul-mouthed Mrs. Bickerman is perhaps the biggest let down.  Somebody out there thinks that hearing older people curse and swear is funny, when in fact is just seems silly.  Lake Placid offers up the occasional bit of gore, and the effects are often interesting.  Sadly, it ends there.  Whether this is a serious action flick, or whether this is an over the top spoof, the film never delivers the goods.

Betty White is fantastic in her role, but the others have a lot to answer for. There is not much of a story, and any cinema goer will understand the plot in a second, but its still entertaining in a mindless action/adventure kind of way.  Its also really short at 82 minutes, but even that seemed to drag a little bit. I thought it was nice to see Meredith Salenger back on the big screen again ( even if she didn't get much screen time). But its not a great film, I would not even call it good. Probably a little bit better than Deep Blue Sea, but thats not really saying much.

It adds a fair bit of flavour, at least for any crocodile who might get to enjoy lunch. Check out the crocodile in the foyer at Cairns Central. It's not bad.Lake Placid is a comedy creature fest starring an amazingly young looking Bridget Fonda, an even fatter looking Oliver Platt, a rather bemused, lost looking Bill Pullman and a foul mouthed, elderly Betty White playing the aptly named Mrs Bickerman.A beaver tagger (there are plenty of double meanings in Lake Placid) is attacked suddenly by an underwater camera and eaten from the bottom down. There's a hungry big beast down there and we'd all better look out.Sassy mouthed Kelly, a paleontologist from the museum in New York has just been dumped by her boyfriend boss and he sends her down to Maine to check out a strange looking tooth. The fang had been dug out of the carcass of the beaver diver.Now that's one way to get even.She doesn't want to camp near the lake (her fingernails might get dirty) and doesn't want to paddle around in a canoe on the lake (her fingers might get eaten!) but there's a possible new boyfriend in fish expert Jack Wells (Pulman) for her to nibble on.Or perhaps the millionaire, eccentric, crocodile worshiper Hector Cyr played by Oliver Platt (Con Air, The Mouse Hunt, Funny Games) might cheer up our heroine. But he's in conflict with the sheriff played by Irishman Brendan Gleeson, who must have had a hard time keeping a straight face in what must have been for the most part a fun film to make.This film was scripted by David (Emmy) Kelly whose dialogue for Ally McBeal, The Practice and Chicago Hope has won him lots of awards and made him lots of money.True to form Lake Placid's script is blisteringly sarcastic, at least for the first third (of what is quite a short movie at 82 minutes).But the crocodile blunts its bite as the film progresses, almost totally losing credibility when there's a certain clash between the croc and a big bear.It's the special effects that let this film down which is a bit of a surprise given the success of the digital creature animals in many other modern films like Deep Blue Sea, Mighty Joe Young, Anaconda and Starship Troopers. I suppose that there's a pretty high standard set these days. The crocodile in Lake Placid would have been a sensation probably only three years ago.Oliver Platt's character is cheerfully and almost successfully promiscuous and the pony tailed Bridget Fonda (a self confessed beautiful woman) could almost take the part of a teenager in her next film, perhaps a little something called Barbarella's Daughter.

This story takes place in a quite town on the New England border in northern Maine.  But this town won't be quiet for long.  After a few gnarly bodies are found floating around, some of the worlds most famous animal chasers and thier entorage race to the town.  It takes these experts a couple of agonizing days and a few more grizzly bodies to figure out what creature is devouring everybody, an alligator.  At this piont the specialists decide to forget the capture and go for the kill.  Enter the beautiful feminist actress who tells them that it is totally wrong to kill animals.  The angry mob should send this nice alligator to a zoo, This movie was not filled with good acting at all.  It seemed like the actors/actresses were reading off que cards the entire movie.  And the script was not well thought out either.  This movie was way too predictable. For instance every time the alligator would appeared all the girls would bounce up and down and scream, while the big strong men would try to capture it with fishing nets.  They finally devise this big plan and whip out the big guns, but the alligator foils this plan.  And suddenly the alligator traps himself, and all the testosterone spraying men are the heroes.  Then the alligaotr is transported across America to a zoo. I think that this would be a good movie if u were looking for something to do during one of those long boring summer days.  I am not trying to say that this was a bad movie, but any movie with a  120 foot alligator is not going to have a complicated plot or script.

However, since I haven't seen him on the big screen since Zero Effect I was looking forward to see Lake Placid. I really wanted to see him in an adventure kind of movie where he gets to sweat and run and yell a little. And a few funny lines wouldn't hurt either.  Well, I don't know what happened. I saw him sweat, run and yell and crack some jokes and yet somehow the whole thing didn't sit well with me. I like sarcasm. I like it a lot. So I should've enjoyed the humour, but failed miserably. I laughed a few times, especially at the beginning, but soon I felt overwhelmed. I'm afraid there is such a thing as too much fun. Too many jokes crammed into 80 something minutes, and you drown in it after a while. The biggest problem for me was that the characters seemed too one dimensional. We had a B. Fonda character whose job was to bitch and whine about everything, and that's all she did throughout the whole movie. Then we had the O. Platt character who did nothing else but cracked jokes. The B. Gleeson character's job was to be the butt of these jokes, the B. White character swore all the time and the Bill Pullman character....,well, he didn't have a lot to say or do, but he  sure looked darn good! And that brings me to the romance part of the movie. I was killing myself the whole time trying to figure out why Fonda and Pullman would end up together. She was pretty for sure, but she was also the biggest pain in the backside I've ever seen in a movie. I really hoped the crock would eat her very soon, but it didn't. So I thought maybe Jack hasn't had a date for months. Or years, and he was desperate. But come on, this is a smart, intelligent, good looking guy who drives a cool truck. Women should be buzzing around him all the time! So what the heck? So all in all, I wasn't crazy about L.P. at all. I'm glad for the opportunity to see Bill again, but he was way overcrowded here. I find that the best way to enjoy him is to clear the screen, put him there all by himself, let him loose and he'll blow your socks off.  I'll give it a 5 out of 10 and hand the worst acting award to B. Fonda who otherwise is a very talented actress and had some great performances in the past.

If the producer/writer had merely taken time to visit a good library, they'd have discovered that an alligator will make every attempt to avoid human beings--and has a bulbous snout--as the creature in this poor movie did. A crocodile is another matter entirely--an aggressive, fearless and fearsome reptile, which will hunt human beings for food. Stan Winston, whose creature effects are usually well done, gave us instead an alligator--period. The beast was not especially frightening. Just as importantly, the human logic was entirely missing. When Betty White led the blindfolded cow down to the river, in plain sight of the predator, the poor dinner plate simply ambled down to the water's edge to meet its quick end. Any animal can scent danger and it made this scene not only absurd but unnecessarily cruel. And why would any human being put himself in harm's way, standing only a few yards away from a supposedly carnivorous reptile? The film's premise was non-existent--no crocodile can survive north of the equator except in equatorial Africa and in the Indo-Pacific region. Moreover, crocodile expert Hector Cyr was mistaken when he told his rapt audience that crocodiles cannot swim in salt water. Apparently, this expert never heard of the feared salt water crocodile, the aggressive man-eaters of northern Australia, also known as the Indo-Pacific crocodile. These crocodiles, which have more of a menacing reputation than their Nile cousins, regularly take to the salt water in the region, swimming from one island to another in search of territory and prey. If writers can be as well paid as David Kelley, where do I get in line? His script was something a child could have turned out. As for the acting, I simply can't imagine that accomplished people such as Bill Pullman and Oliver Platt signed on for such nonsense. Bridget Fonda should be ashamed of herself, given her acting pedigree. She's dropped like a stone from her early promise in Single White Female. She pulled off two impossible feats--swimming away from an attacking crocodile in dark water at night, and holding her breath for over a minute. This cinematic disaster has put her career in a mid-air stall and it seems that she can either go back to acting school or find another career. The locale for such a film should have been in tropical waters to at least force the viewer to find some credibility in a premise entirely without one. Crocodile attacks are frightening events and people lose their lives to them each year, not only in Africa, along the Nile, but also in the Indo-Pacific region where crocodylus porosus the saltwater is king. The technology exists for a ferocious, life-like, man-eating crocodile than the stretched-out alligator the Winston factory I can hear the yawns in the workshop thoughtlessly turned out. Better actors exist to give weight to a story line which has not yet been filmed, and better writers and directors exist to craft a dramatic story line into a gripping and terrifying film.

Of course, Bridget Fonda's character (played very well, might I add) falls out of a boat/truck while in danger of the crocodile.

In the grand tradition of Roger Corman, Lake Placid is a B-grade horror comedy with plenty of thrills but little bite. It seems somebody forgot to put the typical manic zest in this script. What's left is mildly exciting, but horribly lacking.Bridget Fonda stars as a New York paleontologist sent to Maine to investigate the mysterious appearance of a 150 year-old crocodile in a nearby lake. She enlists the help of the local sheriff (talented Brendan Gleeson), a Fish And Wildlife representative (Bill Pullman, in full Bill Pullman mode), and an eccentric crocodile hunter (the always creepy and hideous Oliver Platt). Together they try to figure out just what to do with the reptile that seems to have a taste for human blood.Working from a script by noted TV legend David E. Kelley(The Practice, Ally McBeal), director Steve Miner seems to have a firm grasp of this genre after last year's effective but lethargic horror flick Halloween  H20. Mr. Miner knows how to fully milk an audience for every emotion. Lake Placid is filled to the gills with false dolby scares and a healthy dose of bloodshed. In the midst of a PG-13 revolution, Placid is pleasingly R-rated. It's gory, devilishly so. I enjoyed Mr. Miner's decision to go to the extreme with the visuals. Filmed with breathtaking clarity by Daryn Okada, Placid is fun just to watch. In the middle of deep forests and a shimmering body of water, this film is refreshingly airy and lacks the claustrophobia that hinders other films of this genre.After 1998's Simple Plan, it's a pleasure to report that Bridget Fonda is finally back to real acting. Her newfound energy and a surprising gift for comedy make this performance in Placid even better than I could imagine. She owns the frame every time with her understated performance and wonderful reaction shots. With Bull Pullman, they make the best two croc hunters around. As I said, Oliver Platt is not my favorite actor. Mr. Kelley's script is smothered with one-liners. Almost every other line is a joke of somesorts. The movie seems to rely on Mr. Platt's unfortunate comic timing for most of the gags. His back and forth with Brendan Gleeson is frenetic, but it rarely is funny. The same could be said of the entire movie. It tries hard, but comedy should not have been pushed to the foreground in the movie.The crocodile scenes are the best part of the movie. At 85 minutes, the film uses the reptile only sporadically. The Stan Winston creation is majestic, seamlessly blending with the computer-generated creature that takes over when the croc is in full motion. A standout of the film is a neat scene of the croc attacking a bear on dry land. That kind of momentum should have been Lake Placid, not the I Love Lucy wackiness.While pleasing, Lake Placid is a throwaway movie. You'll forget it 10 minutes after you see it. Mr. Miner and Mr. Kelley seemed to have missed the full opportunity for fun and mayhem that this type of flick can generate. A last minute plot twist involving a second crocodile is shockingly given no attention. Had it been developed a bit more - along with the rest of the movie - Lake Placid could have been a seriously delicious cinematic treat.------------ 7  "},{"Title":"A terrible horror film, but a pretty funny comedy","Date":"14 July 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":"  Going into this movie I thought it would be terrible.

LAKE PLACID is a rip-off of JAWS, JAWS II, and ALLIGATOR, yet unlike those films, this one is boring. Bridget Fonda stars as a palaenogist who goes to a Maine lake to find out what killed a game and fish ranger.  Bill Pullman plays the chief ranger of the game and fish department. And Oliver Platt is the eccentric scientist who worships crocodiles.  They find out that their is a 30 foot crocodile that is living in this lake. To inform you, the lake is not called Lake Placid, because early in the movie, the town sheriff tells Fonda and Pullman that the lake was going to be called Lake Placid, but the townspeople didn't like it.  O.K. so what is it called?  And why call the movie Lake Placid? The plot is dull, the acting is cardbord, and the dialogue is horrible!  When you have GOLDEN GIRLS Betty White calling the town sheriff and deputies the name of a male orgin, you realize that this is one very bad movie.  And the exciting climax?  There isn't one. It's very dull.  And by the time it's over you feel cheated.The only good thing about this film is the women (except for Betty White).  What I mean by that is, it's fun to watch them.  Bridget Fonda, Meredith Salenger, and Mariska Hargitay are all fun to watch, because they are good looking.  I don't want to sound like a sexist pig, or a dirty pervert.  But the women's good looks are the only positive thing about this horrible turkey. You can tell that David E. Kelley (the same one who created t.v.'s ALLEY McBEAL and THE PRACTICE) is trying to jump on the A.S.P.C.A. wagon with the very environmental ending in this film.  I'm guessing his love interest, Michelle Pfeiffer, had some influence on him to write this garbage.  If this is what David E. Kelley calls a good story, then I hate to see what his t.v. shows look like. And Kelley has every right to call this film a horror/comedy.  It's a horror film because it's a scary horrible film to sit through.  And it's a comedy because David E. Kelley is laughing at you by wasting your money on this garbage.  Skip this film at all costs!  * (out of five stars) "},{"Title":"Crikey! This movie bites! Lake Placid is full of croc!","Date":"14 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" To some, Lake Placid might seem, like it mastered, the B-movie horror genre 'so bad, it's good', type of a film. However, for others; the movie is full of mean-spirited, unfunny, somewhat offensive jokes. For me, I felt like, this movie was pretty entertaining, however, I'm not one of those, who would be, a tailgater for this film. This movie can bite me! This tongue-in-cheek, killer croc film was pretty stupid. Directed by Steve Miner, the movie tells the story of a group of wildlife experts, trying to hunt a giant, 30-foot-long man-eating crocodile, which is terrorizes the small community of Black Lake, Maine. Can they capture the beast, or will they become the crocodile's next meal? Watch the movie to find out, if you want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, that Lake Placid isn't that great. Not at all! However, it's a lot better than the later, crocodile related horror films. One thing, that I didn't like, about the film is the characters. All, of them, has their moments of annoyance to me. The only, two characters, I was, somewhat rooting for, was Sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson) & Fish and Game officer Jack Wells (Bill Pullman), because they were the ones, that seem, somewhat normal. Everybody else, I was kinda rooting for the crocodile to eat them. Bridget Fonda as the History paleontologist Kelly Scott, comes across as a whinny city girl, looking for a hookup. The first part of the film, with her, was very hard to get through. I really didn't care to find out, what her previous relationship did to her. Nor did, I care for her forced relationship with Bill Pullman's character. She really doesn't do, much for the film, besides endangering herself and her teammates, anyways. Nor, does she really care, that the crocodile kill people. She still wants it, to be capture, rather than, not killed. What type of human being, does that!? It was there, that I really couldn't stand her presence. Mythology professor/crocodile enthusiast Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt) was the same way. While, he was somewhat funny. His jokes were, mostly a miss, rather than a hit, due to his offensive, often homophobia and womanizer nature. I really didn't like, his preachy, keep the animal alive, approach. Both characters should had died, and the crocodile should had be luggage. See you later, alligator. Bye! Bye! Another problem, with the film was the settlings. For a movie call Lake Placid; it really has a lame excuse for the name, Lake Placid. I was really hoping, the movie settling was, indeed, Lake Placid, New York. Maybe, have, some type of Olympian swimmer, kill the beast in the end. Who Knows! It could probably, make a better movie, than we got. While, this film was a financial success at the box office and was followed by a series of sequels and a crossover film with the Anaconda series. Sadly, this animal attack movie doesn't have the thrill and chills in suspense, like Steven Spielberg's 1975's hit, Jaws. It's not scary, at all. Nor, does the movie master, any sense of horror comedy like Ron Underwood's 1990 Tremors. Still, compared to a lot of killer croc films, out there. Lake Placid features some semi great special effects by both Stan Winston and Digital Domain that, for the most part, hold up, today. The crocodile looks somewhat realistic. The gore effects was good enough for stomach curling. The sequels however not so much, though I do admittedly, they look better than most Sci-Fi Channel Original films. The movie also doesn't really, have much in exposition or plot development. It seem like the movie didn't care about the science, too much, as it's somewhat abandoned, explaining, toward the middle of the film. Even in the end, you still, don't have, no clue, how the crocodile got into the lake in the first place, and how it's able to survive there. Regardless, the movie does have, some good pacing. There were very few filler scenes in this 82 minutes film. Another thing, that I like, about the film is the music; however, it rarely matches, what's going on, with the film. Honestly, how in the hell does 'I Think I Love You' by singer, Maureen Davis & 'It's Not Unusual by singer, Tom Jones, have to do, with a 20ft killer crocodile!? Noting, if you ask me. Overall While, the music doesn't match, well with the film. I still have, to say, this movie still entertains me, enough to get, through it. Nevertheless, this feeding frenzy movie is only good for a one-time watch. Not worth, the rewatchability. This movie has reptile dysfunction.

Most of the flaws are what we consider bad and there are other flaws that are acceptable per se.We start out the movie with an attack on a guy by some creature in a lake. Most Killer-Crocodile movies are after the gore, killing, and suspense, so this scene would seem predicted.What wasn't predicted was that this movie is not on the same note (or beat) of other killer-crocodile movies. Once you start to get into the thrust of the film you find humor, interesting characters, and a plot that doesn't drive itself into what we consider crappy B-style movies.This film has, what, 2 deaths on-screen? Most Killer-Crocodile moves have at least 5 or so, depending on the situation. This movie is not what I consider a true Killer-Crocodile movie because it doesn't go after the gore and endless, meaningless killing.The first guy in the scuba gear was killed for one purpose to set up viewers for the film. Yes, they were actually setting you up. By the first scene in the film, you could suggest that this was all about the killing, the stupidity, the abomination that a lot of killer-crocodile movies are. Now, that was speaking film-wise. Movie wise, I'm guessing the crocodile had it's daily intake of beavers, but he found something much more appetizing. This concludes that he wasn't killed for nothing. Honestly, Killer Crocodiles must have at least 80 stomachs to hold as much food as they do in a lot of films I see now days. This film was realistic in the deaths--the croc got FULL!The second guy, the deputy, he was holding a beacon that had BABY CROC SOUNDS coming out of it. The crocodile was doing it's motherly/fatherly duty by protecting the itteh bitteh babiez. He wasn't killed meaninglessly. It was one of the best death kill I've seen in any Killer-Croc movie. Why? Because even though you didn't actually SEE the crocodile, you saw PART OF IT. For an instance you saw the shadow, the black-mass come up and bite off that dude's head!This movie is not on the same beat other Killer-Crocodile movies are. This movie wasn't a horror film even, considering it does feature a crocodile that kills. This movie provided laughs, a good time, and it can be serious when it wants. Now, not that an actual crocodile could get into that lake, but there are reports every day of a crocodilian getting into lakes, rivers, etc by people putting them there. I knew of a breeder where I was living (Florida) released a 2-year-old Crocodile that was mistreated (LOTS OF DRUGS!) into a lake. There was actual DEATHS because of the creature! Now, doesn't that sound like the plot of a very B-Rated movie? Then real-life is it's own B-Rated movie because that actually happened! All across the world Alligators and Crocodiles are released into natural habitats and people can be injured.This movie served it's purpose. It's one of the BEST crocodile movies I've ever seen, especially with it's reality factor.I'm going to comment on the sequels as well. Lake Placid 2 and Lake Placid 3 didn't even HAPPEN in my book. If I ever make it into the movie business, I'm going to make my own sequel and bring back the original characters. The SyFy channel ruins so many darn series it sickens me. Lake Placid would of been a great stand-alone film without any sequels at all, but of course the Syfy Channel HAS to ruin everything.

Crocodiles and alligators kill their prey differently. Alligators eat their victims, or do the death roll. Crocodiles drown their victims and later eats them. When this crocodile invades the lake everyone has either two options pare it or kill it. They had to spare this one because it was a rare kind and an alien species. The cast of the movies are great. Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, and Oliver Platt are the main characters that really performed their role well. Betty White is very feisty in this movie unlike her Rose Nylund role on NBC's The Golden Girls. And she's a known lover of animals, which makes it work fine. The other crocodile wasn't so lucky.

He is underrated, even though all of his films hit the mark and turn out as above average horror films. This movie is a horror/comedy and is extremely funny.Lake Placid is a giant alligator chase, in the way Jaws was a giant fish chase. Following a grizzly attack of a diver in a Maine lake, the local sheriff (Brendon Gleeson) calls in an expert from the State Fish and Game Department, Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) to investigate. A museum opinion is needed and as the result of some cruel interoffice politics, paleontologist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) is sent to Maine to examine a tooth believed to be from the unknown creature. Not long after, eccentric millionaire Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt) choppers in to help find (and swim with) the creature. A few twists and turns aside, it then becomes a race to find the creature before it kills again.The main thrust of entertainment comes from the interaction of the characters. The dialog is witty and fast paced and all of the characters are well fleshed out. There is a rhythm to their flow and I wouldn't be surprised if the onset mood was fairly relaxed; Director Steve Miner manages to squeeze a surprising amount of tension into the film. The suspense works well to offset the continuous comedy. It is this that stops the film from becoming a farce it has just enough of both comedy and horror to work well. "},{"Title":"Derr-Dum....

The pattern of this film goes like this you get one scene of horror followed by one scene of comedy followed by one scene of horror and comedy and so on and on and on. It's very weird but for the most part I found Lake Placid to be entertaining in a strange way. At least it's better than Eaten Alive, the bizarre horror film I saw recently that featured a crocodile. Lake Placid at least has some good actors in it. Bridget Fonda is the paleontologist; Bill Pullman is the game warden; Oliver Platt is the crocodile expert; Brendan Gleeson is the sheriff; and former Golden Girl Betty White is the old crazy lady. Good actors who spend most of the time arguing hilariously with each other thanks to veteran TV writer David E. Kelley's silly screenplay. It's really hard to believe that the man who created critically acclaimed TV shows such as The Practice, Ally McBeal, Chicago Hope, and Picket Fences wrote this movie. At times, it feels like Kelley was originally writing Lake Placid for the small screen as a TV movie. But then, decided to make it into a feature film by adding more gore and foul language. The strong language does feel like it was tacked on to this (especially the F-word) and I think the reason for that is that Kelley can't write hard, R-rated four-letter words into his scripts for his TV shows because the networks won't allow it (even though the networks do allow some lighter profanity in many current TV shows). I had the exact same feeling toward Kelley's screenplay for his other 1999 feature film Mystery, Alaska. Judging on the basis of these two scripts of Lake Placid and Mystery, Alaska, David E. Kelley should just stick with television. Even though the script to Lake Placid is a mess, it's still a fun movie with a good cast and good creature effects. And it's great to see longtime TV queen Betty White get a chance to do a feature film. She's hilarious. Yes, she does use some bad language like everyone else in this film (thanks to David E. Kelley), but I want to set the record straight she doesn't spew profanity as much as most people have said.*** (out of four)  "},{"Title":"No matter how low your expectations are, this film will disappoint you","Date":"7 April 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":"  When I walked into the cinema showing Lake Placid, I comforted myself with the following words - `No matter how bad this film is, it CAN'T be worse than Deep Blue Sea.'Amazingly enough, I was wrong.No one walks into a film about a giant, man-eating alligator and expects something brilliant.  You don't go in looking for great acting, intelligent dialogue or moving sub-plots.  You do, however, expect this- some great special effects- a high body count - the occasional suspensful scene- and a couple of quirky, expendable characters that keep you amused for a while until they get killed.Lake Placid had NONE of these things.Let's start with the effects &#150; or, more accurately, the &#145;effect' &#150; since there really wasn't much to look at other than the alligator.  The alligator was okay; he was big, he was nasty, and he moved a touch better than the giant monsters did back in the fifties.  The problem was, he really didn't DO anything.  Other than a few snappy scenes involving a helicopter and a bear, the alligator spent most of the film lazing about the lake and failing to kill anyone.  In the mass slaughter department, he just wasn't up to it. As for a high body count, more people die in an average episode of ER than were killed in this film.  Whereas you normally sit through a horror film saying &#150; `Oh no, I can't BELIEVE they killed off that character - I was just starting to like him', this film provokes the opposite reaction.  You hate ALL the characters and virtually none of them die.  Suspense was also sadly lacking in this film.  There wasn't a single moment where I felt scared, worried, concerned or even a little bit &#145;edgy'.   The only possible exception was the 80 minute mark, where I began to worry that the film was going to run for two hours.  Thankfully, it finished two minutes later.Finally, I come to the &#145;characters' &#150; a term I use loosely and only because convention dictates it.  I have NEVER hated a cast as much as I hated this one.  If I had have been there with them, I would have gladly lopped off their heads and fed them to the alligator, just to spare the audience from any further dialogue.  Bill Pulman is his usual unbearable self, playing yet another `hi, my name's Mr Average' type character.   Bridget Fonda (playing &#145;city chick roughs it in the country' &#150; gee, there's a new one) stinks up the place from beginning to end and absolutely BEGS to get eaten.  The PATHETIC romantic subplot between these two characters is as implausible as it is unbearable.  Betty White, said by some reviewers on this site to have &#145;stolen the show' quote unquote (which, I might add, would have been one of the easiest thefts in the history of cinema) was nothing short of EMBARASSING.  Sure, if you're thirteen years old you might find one of the Golden Girls swearing her head off hilarious, but for the rest of us, it was just lame. Brendan Gleeson's &#145;Sheriff Hank Keough' was abysmally unfunny and his friendship with &#145;kooky nut' Walt Lawson was nothing short of painful. As for the claim that the film is some sort of &#145;spoof' and so &#145;shouldn't be taken too seriously', let me just say this &#150; I AM SICK TO DEATH of people using these phrases to excuse atrocious crud that is neither funny nor dramatic.  It's as if failing to pull off either of these objectives entitles you to say &#150; &#145;Hang on guys, lighten up, this wasn't MEANT to be a good film &#150; it's all just tongue in cheek!'  Well, if that's the case, why didn't you actually make the film FUNNY?  Why not make it a genuine parody &#150; give it humour, give it insight, enable it to make FUN of the genre, not just wallow in the middle of it!David E Kelley has made more money out of less talent than any man on earth.

We have a monster movie called Lake Placid that's not set in a LAKE called Lake Placid because - as one of the movie's character's says, We heard that name was taken. Ohhhh brother. So we know we're already in trouble, don't we?Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) is the Authority Figure in Charge here, and the actor does it with typical Bill Pullman grit, squinting his eyes and clenching his teeth so much you start to fear he'll develop receding gums right before your eyes. He's joined by very-reluctant-museum-researcher Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) who is so thoroughly obnoxious, repugnant, and dislikable from the get-go that you openly wish this prehistoric crocodile eats her right up, like an acidic hors d'oeuvre. Thankfully, her character mellows out a little, with a not-too-subtle thrust-and-parry, wink-wink-wink with Pullman. And believe me, I DO mean not-too-subtle. But then again, I get the feeling that the writers of this movie aren't really in favor of subtlety. Joining this sly but bickering duo is Oliver Platt, playing some kind of crocodile expert, the eccentric kind who lands his own plane on the lake. Platt, a gifted actor, gives one of the hammiest performances this side of Marlon Brando. The writers of this tripe, you see, have Kelly and Jack as one pairing and Oliver Platt and Brendan Gleeson (as the sheriff, who looks a heck of a lot like the Skipper on Gilligan's Island). A hidden theme, perhaps? Well, let's not give them that kind of credit, okay?Oh yes, I almost forgot, there's a crocodile. Big sucker, too, about 30 feet long, and - in a roundabout, convoluted way - the movie tries hard to convince us it's a prehistoric leftover. (Like we care! Show us the gore!)It's in this film early and often, and we get to see it devouring such normal cuisine as cows, horses, etc. Swallows them whole, too, and that IS fun to watch. Hey, we're not paying to see Oliver Platt, are we? Heck no! We wanna see the croc! At least in this, the makers of this movie don't really fail us. Sure, there might be a threadbare plot, and characterizations as shallow as those you might find in a XXX movie, but the effects and action are there, at least.

David Kelley tries to bring the giant monster B movie into the 90's (in 99, isn't it a little late?).  While the dialogue is amusing enough (although totally unbelievable - does anyone _ever_ really speak this way), the characters are kinda bland.  Kelley has yet to learn that giving someone eccentricities does not equal character development.Bill Pullman really has nothing to do, while Bridget Fonda auditions for the Kelley Stick Women Club  you wonder what possible appeal she has to be eaten by a crocodile.  Oliver Platt is appealing enough, but at the end of the day he's still playing an unmotivated nut-job.  Brendan Gleeson is probably the best actor here with the best character.  Betty White's character lacks any kind of development, and her swearing gets real old, real fast once the shock value wears off.  Everyone else is forgettable.And as for the plot...ummm, what plot?

The cast here was much better than those in Anaconda, each of them delivering a good performance of their character and the script well written with plenty of one-liners and quick comebacks that allow for a good laugh while eagerly waiting for the next time for the crocodile to strike. Betty White was truly hilarous! The special effects were much better and overall there was plenty of more action in Lake Placid.I really liked the movie, I went into it expecting nothing more than a typical 'monster killing people' type of movie and that's pretty much what I got. If you want complicated plot twists or a confusing story line, go see the Matrix or something. If you are happy with a basic slasher film (where the 'slasher' is a creature), go see it. I could have done without the typical romance between the lead actors (Pullman and Fonda), but it seems every movie now adays must incorporate some type of romance. Fortunately, the movie doesnt dwell too long on the romance and remains focused on the 'man vs creature' theme.Again, I suggest checking this out if nothing for a few good laughs, good special effects, and a straight-up horror film.And how can you not like a director who manages to get his mentioned in the movie (Paging Dr. Miner, Dr Miner.)

This movie begs to be heckled in such a manner.First, there isn't enough crocodile to sustain the limp plot.  Let's face it, the only giant animal horror/action movie that successfully went beyond it's genre was Jaws.  All other variants on the theme, by nature of the beast (sorry), must conform to a specific set of rules.  The prime rule is that because the plot is usually so threadbare you MUST show a lot of exciting sequences with the monster.  This will distract the audience. More importantly, it's what the target audience pays to see.  The monster is, after all, the star of the show.Lake Placid breaks this fundamental rule by making the crocodile a supporting castmember.  He appears in only five scenes, and two of those appearances are blink-and-you'll-miss quick.  Even worse, is that the crocodile has no character!  He appears, he thrashes around, he chews, he swims.  You never really connect with him.  Even the giant ants in Them! had more moxie.If you deny the audience the chance to appreciate the giant crocodile, what do you have left to back up the film?  The answer is - not much.  The acting is functional, but not enthused, and the dialogue is filled with Ally McBeal bits which are wildly misplaced in this genre.In the end (literally) the movie is reduced to a sight gag for a punchline. Rent it with a group of friends, get really drunk, then watch a rerun of Xena instead.

You have to applaud him for having the guts for using shots right out of the first two Jaws films. But as good as this film was in some parts ( and it is really good in some parts ) it is just an inch or two off being great.Lake Placid is about a giant crocodile that has inhabited a small Maine lake.  The lake isn't even called Lake Placid, but that is a whole other story.  The beginning starts off with a guy from the Department of Games and Fishing searching for beavers so he can tag them.  And the opening ten minutes are a true homage to the fear Jaws presented us with.  And it is here that Miner has some of his strongest work in his whole career.  He uses the camera to make us feel the unknown danger that is imminently lurking in the water.  We feel for the safety of the diver and we don't even like him that much.  Now that is good film making.When the diver is under water, we see lots of shots from behind, as if the unseen terror is about to pounce on him, and then, boom, the first false scare.  That moment in the film had me full of optimism because it made me jump.  And not just a small twitch, I mean it made me leap out of my seat. That doesn't happen too often in horror films now a days.  But here it does.Finally when the attack does happen, we are treated to an exact shot of one of the scariest shots from Jaws 2.  I am not going to reveal which one, but you have to see the film just for this part.  It is a great shot and it really sets the tone for the rest of the film.After the opening death, we meet the main players of the film.  And this is where I am a little skeptical of the film.  It's not that these characters aren't done well, it's that they could have been done a whole lot better with perhaps another re-write.  Some of the dialogue is very funny but it is hollow in some ways.  Oliver Platt gets off some of the best lines and that is more of a testament to his timing and ability than it is to the script. But having said that, the film does move pretty quickly.  And we are treated to some more scary shots from the water.  To me, there is nothing more scary than what may or may not be in the water.  The anticipation of death is much more scary than death itself.  Lake Placid takes that notion and does a great job, most of the time making it work.The one part of the film that is absolutely terrible though is the last ten minutes of the film.  It is hollow.  It just happens and then everyone goes home.  There is no real climax, no real tension and that is too bad because it takes away from the rest of the film.  And Steve Miner is known for this. He is great out of the gate, but he fades at the end.  He did it in the final Friday the 13th and he does it here.  It's like he uses all of his clever ideas at the beginning and then has nothing left for the end and then just closes up shop.Lake Placid almost succeeds.  Almost.  But it ultimately lets you down when it showed such promise throughout.  I enjoyed most of this film and you should give it a chance.  Deep Blue Sea is coming out in a few weeks and that should be quite good.  Consider this a prelude to that film.  It's good, but not quite great.   "},{"Title":"Awful!

Local fisheries bring in the big guns from an interstate museum and a big game hunter (Platt) to help track and neutralise the prehistoric beast, with the idea of transferring it to a zoo. Bill Pullman is a typically relaxed anti-hero, awkwardly establishing affections with neurotic archaeologist Bridget Fonda, while Oliver Platt steals all his scenes as a playboy game hunter and self-proclaimed St Francis of the animal kingdom.A supposedly sharp script is really nothing more than a series of bawdy jokes peppered with expletives; the local dim-witted sheriff's catchphrase (everyone's a sarcastic) isn't so much funny as it is perplexing. Essentially, the dialogue is too thick with crass humour and far too self indulgent (in my opinion). As a result, the characterisations are more like caricatures save for Betty White's foul-mouthed elder, who in a surprise piece of casting, provides the only vaguely amusing moments in the film.Gore galore for the bloodthirsty, with heads, torsos even toes strewn across the lake in the wake of the giant, prehistoric crocodile and its cow-sized appetite. The special effects and make-up are realistic looking (if you know what a real severed head looks like) and the mechanical beast is a triumph of electrical and presumably pneumatic engineering. In spite of its successes, my experience of this film was that the hype exceeded the reality, the humour too self-aware, the film almost becoming a self parody where the running jokes wear thin very quickly. Disappointing.

It was creamed by both critics and movie goers alike as a piece of crap with making numerous references to the 1975 blockbuster hit Jaws and the 1980's B-Movie Alligator.The film starts out with the local sheriff (the gifted Brendan Gleeson) and a diver checking out something into the lakes of Maine where all of a sudden, the diver gets attacked and bitten in half from the waist down leaving him dead. After the attack, the state calls a paleontologist from New York, played by Bridget Fonda, to go and investigate the incident if an ancient creature is responsible for the attack. Once she arrives the paleontologist dislikes the state along with not being a friendly member to both the sheriff and the fish and game warden (played by Bill Pullman). While more members from both scientists and local law enforcement are involved, they get closer to discover that a large crocodile is on the run killing those that surround the lake and the forest.I'll admit, I had fun watching this movie, but then again, the trailer promised that a horror picture was in the works where all I saw was a comedy. There was more laughs than thrills in which the lines from Betty White, Oliver Platt (the second scientist) and Brendan Gleeson stole scenes from the film. The film is like I said, a Jaws ripoff where there are too many similarities from characters such as the local sheriff, the scientists, the hunter and so forth; location is another reason where Jaws and Lake Placid take place in small communities where the waters are the monsters homes.In the end, it could've been a little better.

LAKE PLACID is obviously a JAWS knock-off, there's no hiding that. Once you see how they make the approach of the monster, a giant crocodile, here, you'll know what I mean. The movie's about a giant crocodile which apparently lost its way to a lake in Maine (the lake is called Black Lake, so the title LAKE PLACID still remains a mystery). It's up to a couple of misfit characters to stop it, and these bunch misfits happens to be Bill Pullman as a sheriff, Bridget Fonda as a paleontologist, Brendan Gleeson as a park ranger and Oliver Platt hamming it up for his cause as an eccentric crocodile hunter. And if they're not going after the giant croc, they're yelling at each other in sarcastic dialog like they just lost their way from a TV sitcom. That's something! Actually, this mockery is actually intentional, and actually pretty good. And we have Ally McBeal's writer David Kelley to thank for that. For a JAWS rip-off, it doesn't take itself seriously, for good cause. Director Steve Miner (a slasher movie graduate from films like Friday THE 13TH II) has a lot of fun combining some shocks with solid bits of sarcasm. There's some suspenseful scenes, but it's more of a comedy, and it does its job surprisingly well. The performances are meant to be adequate, but Platt in his role affords to provide his character with shameless glee and he's the best thing about the film next to the giant croc. The croc is, by the way, a good-looking combination of CG effects and animatronics, yet another marvelous creation from Stan Winston Studios (JURASSIC PARK).The crew knows the whole point of the film is stupid, and it won't break the box-office barrier. The likes of these film died of many years ago (except for JAWS which is a different breed). Unlike other films of this kind (here's looking at you ANACONDA), LAKE PLACID has more fun with itself and at itself, and that's honest entertainment.Rating *** out of 5.

Also, it falls into the usual horror cliché - characters go into places where they just shouldn't - i.e. diving in the murky lake where the crocodile lives. The stupidity of the (professional) characters is perhaps the most frightening aspect of the film - it actually takes 20 minutes or so before they suspect its a crocodile.

His penchant for throwing together odd characters engaging in puerile sardonic dialogue is taken to its bizarre extreme in this film.With a &#145;creature-feature' the plot is always the same  It's out there destroying things and killing people and our heroes need to get rid of it.  In this case the creature is a 30 foot crocodile from Asia that ends up in a lake in Maine.  There is never any explanation or even conjecture of how it got there or how it got so big.  It's just there; eating cows, bears, humans, and any other mammal that crosses its path.  The purpose of the creature in all such films is to scare us and then be neutralized at the hands of our heroes.  In this limited way the movie was a great success.  Unfortunately, even a creature-feature requires some dialogue.  This is where Lake Placid hits the water with a resounding thud.Kelley attempts to create a black comedy, but unfortunately he leaves out the humor and replaces it with asinine banter.  The dialogue among this random hodgepodge of wackos is goofy, jejune, sarcastic and only occasionally funny.  Indeed the only really funny lines went to Betty White, who was a scream.The direction by Steve Miner was first rate.  Miner is a veteran of the horror genre and all the action, suspense and beast sequences were expertly done.  The animatronics were fabulous as were the digital sequences when the crocodile was on land.  The locations were beautiful and nicely chosen for their backdrops.  Miner did as good a job as anyone could hope considering the actors had to run their lines between creature scenes.There isn't much point to evaluating the actors (it was a good cast), because their characters were so weird, and they had so little material to work with, they all came across looking inane.I'd give this film an 8 for the creature and about a 2 for the script.

The character of the sheriff is a total bore and Brenden Gleeson should feel ashamed for such terrible acting. Bill Pullman is just going through the motions and his acting is terrible as well. Bridget Fonda....nuff said. The only saving grace this film has going for it are special effects and Oliver Platt. It's always interesting to me that these films garner such wonderful casts and make actors seem so much more untalented. The croc is a joy to watch eat, I really did like the bear sequence.

Kelley (which explains Fonda's neurotic Ally McBeal-style character); the superb cast includes Bill Pullman as the hero, Oliver Platt as millionaire croc hunter, Meredith Salenger as a sexy deputy, and 'Golden Girl' Betty White as a batty old dear who befriends the creature; and the top-notch special effects are by Stan Winston's studio and CGI experts Digital Domain.With some fun gore (a body ripped in two and a bloke having his head bitten off), plenty of excitement, and a delightfully silly finale that sees the croc lured to the shore by a cow suspended from a helicopter, Lake Placid is well worth a visit.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

Nor, for that matter, does it have anything to do with the lesser-known places named Lake Placid in Texas and Florida. Although it was actually filmed in Canada, it is ostensibly set around a (fictitious) lake in Maine which was going to be called Lake Placid but which ended up being called something else because the name was already taken, all of which sounds like a horribly convoluted explanation for the title. I can only assume that someone thought that Lake Placid was an excellent title for a film and had to come up with an equally convoluted plot to fit it.No doubt the film would have been called Jaws if that name had not also already been taken. The central premise is that a monstrous crocodile is living a lake in Maine, and not just any crocodile but a freshwater Asian crocodile. No convincing attempt is made to explain why a cold-blooded tropical reptile should has taken up residence in a state with such a cold climate, many thousands of miles from its natural habitat, nor how it has managed to survive the icy New England winters. Although the beast is thirty feet long, it has managed to remain unnoticed until it bites a scientist in half while he is carrying research into beavers, whereupon a motley team consisting of the local sheriff, a game warden, a female palaeontologist and a professor of mythology with a particular interest in crocodiles swing into action to try and hunt it down.Despite the feebleness of the script, the film-makers managed to recruit a number of well-known actors, including Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman and Brendan Gleeson. I wonder what (apart from the money) could have attracted them to the film, which appears to have been made as a tongue-in-cheek nineties update of those old monster B-movies from the fifties. The film-makers appear to have realised that it is no longer possible to make a wholly serious film of this type; unfortunately, they have failed to realise that a bad film cannot automatically be made a good one by injecting it with doses of ironical, postmodernist humour. There is no real attempt to turn this into a Mel Brooks-style parody, and the film remains an uneasy mixture of semi-serious horror and feeble attempts at comedy, mostly derived from the squabbles which break out among the team of crocodile-hunters. Lake Placid is sometimes described as a horror-comedy. Like a number of films which attempt to combine two different genres, this one falls between two stools. It is too ludicrous to be genuinely frightening, and too morbid to be genuinely amusing, although it might cater for that specialist niche market which regards as uproariously funny the sight of someone getting their head bitten off. 3/10 "},{"Title":"Entertaining","Date":"8 January 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" Lake Placid is not a 'great' film by some peoples standards.

It didn't come as a shock, I just didn't like it. The attempts at comedy almost always fall flat, and the film-makers are trying desperately hard to make you laugh, but end up being embarrassing for the actors as well as the director(come on, this guy did H20; that wasn't much, but it was definitely better than this). The plot is apparently supposed to be a rehash/mocking of monster movies. It doesn't work well. It's poorly paced and thoroughly boring. The acting is decent enough. The characters are all one-dimensional and uninteresting; we don't care about these people, whether they live or die... and that ruins every chance of keeping the attention of the audience during the attack scenes. The film especially drags near the end; I was hoping, nay, praying that it would just end soon. The film didn't manage to keep my attention nor my interest for an hour and a half, and that's not even that hard to do. The special effects are pretty good, but that's pretty much the only positive thing to say about this film. The humor is way too over-the-top and trying far too hard to be funny, and just ends up making you cringe and lose any and all interest in the film whatsoever. As a horror film, it doesn't work. As a parody/comedy, it doesn't work either. So, are we supposed to think of this movie in a third way? Nah. Let's just write it off as a poor attempt at a horror-parody-flick. I recommend this only to big fans of the actors, and huge fans of monster-flicks. Anyone else should avoid this. I give it a 6/10 only because the effects are pretty good and the film did manage to keep me watching(for some unknown reason).

She is there to help identify a large tooth found inside the corpse of a diver who was chewed in half while underwater. When it is revealed to be that of a very large crocodile, she teams up with numerous game wardens, a wild life officer (BILL PULLMAN) the town sheriff (BRENDAN GLEASON) & members of his department & an eccentric thrill seeking mythological professor/millionaire (OLIVER PLATT) who dreams of swimming with crocodiles, mainly because crocodiles were highly worshipped in many nations in centuries past. While together, they decide to camp out by the lake in an effort to draw out the beast & hopefully trap it. However when they come fact to face with the carnivorous creature, they discover that the traps they have laid out in order to capture the beast may be to small, as it turns out they are dealing with a monstrous 30 foot predator with an appetite for carnage to match!LAKE PLACID is everything a really good monster movie should be, exciting, gory, funny, sharp & witty, with good acting, direction, special effects & snappy dialogue, plus it has a good plot, fun characters & even gets a bit schlocky at times (but in a good way). To be truthful though, despite it's (then A- list) cast & huge theatrical treatment, LAKE PLACID is basically a glorified B movie (at least in terms of it's plot) but for the most part the film is very well handled, especially when it comes to the direction, as Steve Miner manages to keep the film moving at a quick pace & captures the gorgeous lakeside & wooded scenery very well on camera (it's utterly breathtaking & so beautiful to look at!) the suspense is very well handled, with one moment in particular towards the climax should bring the most strongest of wills onto the edge of the their seat! another thing I liked was the twist ending, which reveals that there was not just one crocodile eating people, but rather two! & unlike most creature features, the beast is never killed at the climax, instead it's shipped away to a zoo. It's definitely a change from the norm, that I will give them, it's just to bad the same thing couldn't be said for the other croc, who winds up having his head blown off! (in a scene that pays tribute to JAWS). The acting is really good here, especially Beatty White as an eccentric elderly housewife, who winds up feeding most of her live stock to the beast. The rest of the characters are pretty funny as they all have a pretty good biting wit about them. But it's Oliver Platt who steals almost every scene he's in, as the eccentric millionaire. The monster attack sequences are not only quick, but brutal & gory & many times come in moments you would least expect them too. The creature effects (a mix of both practical & CGI) are very well done & realistic looking (the practical effects were done by the late Stan Winston, a friend of director Miner). Plus the creature is taken very seriously here.On the downside however, the film never really amounts to much, at least not where most creature features are concerned, as the film really doesn't do anything too new with the material (at least nothing that we haven't seen before) minus adding the quirky characters & humour (the latter of which does get a little juvenile at times) & the climax is somewhat disappointing, especially considering the momentum the film had going in when building towards it's climax & I wasn't to thrilled with the romantic angle between Bill Pullman's character & Bridget Fonda, it just felt out of place for the movie & cheapened it somewhat, thankfully Miner doesn't seem too interested in it either & downplays it through most of the film. The script by The Practice/Ally McBeal writer David E. Kelly (who also co-produced) while quiet good, has a few problems, mainly due to the fact that Kelly seems unsure of what he wants his script to be, a straight up serious monster movie? or a spoof on the genre? this must be asked because the film tends to waver between both, while the jokier aspects are fun, still Kelly at times seems to be trying to aim for a higher level for his film that is never really obtained (or at least doesn't know how to obtain it) & this is clearly evident as he tries to make his film much more of a character driven film than a monster one, unfortunately while the characters are interesting & quirky enough to follow & enjoyable when they are on screen, LAKE PLACID suffers as a result, since the film has many long stretches (especially in the middle half of the film) where there is almost no action at all & no heavy crocodile carnage & the film gets a little to hokey at times. Horror fans will also be disappointed by the extremely low body count, despite the gory kills which include a chewed off head & a body bitten in half.All in all, I highly recommend LAKE PLACID, it's a monster movie with bite! I admit I definitely wasn't a fan of it the first time I seen it (When it first arrived on video), but after giving it another go, I understood what it was mainly all about, the attitude it was reaching for & I caught all the in jokes it was playing up to, while not a masterpiece by any means, LAKE PLACID is just plain flat out, good, gory B movie fun!Followed by four sequels, beginning with LAKE PLACID 2***1/2 stars "},{"Title":"Very entertaining","Date":"27 May 2012","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" I really enjoyed Lake Placcid.

The script by David E. Kelley moves along like a rocket & thankfully never becomes bogged down with boring & unnecessary sub-plots & mixes both comedy & horror extremely well. Lake Placid is at heart a throw back to the 50's & 60's giant monster films but is probably as good, if not better than any of those as it uses up-to-date special effects & goes for a witty script. There are some great one-liners, funny dialogue exchanges, sarcasm & the usual self referential lighthearted quips made so popular by Scream (1996). The horror elements are here as well with some nice attacks that manage to create good solid shocks, well my friend Kelly thought so anyway & I tend to agree with her. The characters are very likable especially Hank the hapless cynical Sheriff. The ending felt a little routine & unoriginal & you just know that their plan for trapping the Crocodile will go wrong, I also would have liked to have seen the Crocodile eat a couple more people but you can't have everything I suppose. Technically Lake Placid is very good & considering the supposed $27,000,000 budget I would hope so, the Crocodile is brought to life using both some OK CGI & some excellent animatronic live-action effects by Stan Winston. The cinematography by Daryn Okada is cool & a few shots really capture the expansive forest & beauty of the locations used. There are a few gore scenes but nothing too graphic, a man bitten in half & later his corpse is seen on an autopsy table, a severed head & toe, a decapitation & a some of the local wildlife get eaten. The acting is pretty good by the likable cast & I actually wanted most of them to live, Betty White as the foul mouthed Dolores Bickerman is very funny & gets some good lines. I really liked Lake Placid, my friend Kelly liked it so I didn't think I would as we don't normally share the same taste in films but this is one occasion where she is right, for a change (sorry Kelly only joking!).

Soon more and more people are eaten but they think that the large creature could be due to an elderly woman (Betty White) who lives on the lake. LAKE PLACID, the title, is still somewhat of a mystery considering where the film is taking place and what the lake is actually called but that's not too big of a point as the overall film is fairly fun and does improve on a second viewing. I think the film's biggest flaw is that it's incredibly uneven. I've heard rumors that originally this was meant to be some sort of spoof, which makes a little sense considering the type of humor in the film. The movie goes for a lot more laughs and most of them come from Gleeson and Platt who are constantly at each others throats. The two actors are both very good in their roles and I must admit that I laughed at a lot of their banter. This humor expands to other characters including the one played by Fonda as she goes way over the top in order to get laughs. We have her New York City gal going through all sorts of country jokes as she's afraid to get dirty, to sleep in a tent and that type of thing. For me Fonda's character is the weakest written and she also goes too far out there. Pullman is good as usual but his character isn't all that interesting. The comedy in the film is certainly the main goal, or at least it seems that way. There aren't any real scares to be found in the film and I can't think of too many examples where there was even an attempt. The croc in the film looks pretty good and especially when you compare it to other large croc movies. I thought the effects of it taking were also pretty good, although I'll admit that the scene where it attacks the bear isn't all that effective. LAKE PLACID, in the end, is too uneven to really call a good movie but if you can put up with the comic stuff you'll probably enjoy up enjoying it as a B movie.

He really tries to keep his usual style, but then all of a sudden this croc gets in his way, which makes the writing pretty forced and unpleasant. By the way, you really shouldn't watch this expecting people being attacked and killed and torn apart and whatnot, because our villain barely justifies his presence on the poster. He's of very little importance and just provides an excuse to have various people meet and deliver some rather unimpressive dialogues.

The story is thin, the actors are bad, the characters are seriously weird and the horror/comedy mix is as awful as it can get! I could write a very long list of errors and flops in this movie, but lets make it short. I want to focus on some of the big flops/questions this movie contains The biggest question is HOW DID THAT OLD LADY GET THOSE CRODODILLES? How can she tame them when they are adults? if you think of it, every one that tries to tame a Lion or a Tiger knows that these animals are not used to be pets, so its impossible to tame a animal that large. And by the way why oh why do that old lady have Cows, horses, chickens next to a lake? When you live near a lake, you DO NOT run a farm, you go fishing in the lake!!!!! The characters are seriously weird! At points they can work together, and even talk normally, but suddenly they just flip out and begins to yell and argue about something that isn't important! Another problem is with the role Bridget Fonda plays (Katty or something (from now on called Katty). She is letting us know something about her1) allergic to trees 2) hate Moquitoes 3) hate Ticks (the nasty little treehanging animal) 4) doesn't know what camping isShe is supposed to be a Big City girl who don't know anything about nature. But the problem is that she HAS been to lakes like lake Placid as a kid!!!!!!! She says that she always spent time at a lake, throwing stones at the water. But how can she suddenly have an allergy for trees? how can she NOT know that camping is used to be in tents?It makes no sense that she HAS been out of the city as a child, but as an adult cannot be a minute at a Lake in Maine!!!! And by the way When she is helping the policeman (which she is (at some points) in love with) in the tent, she is telling that her father was a surgeon. Well it could be, but do surgeons use plaster? do Suregeons use plaster when they a finished with an operation? The answer is NO!!! Its a lame dialog, as all the other dialogs in this movie!!!The investigation team is not investigating, they are just fooling around trying to find an animal, which they don't know what is and what to do with!! And here another question Which animal does the old policeman (who hates Hector) suspect is the killer? He doesn't think that it is a crocodile, so what animal did attack the boat in the middle of the lake? The Loch Ness monster? a underwater bear? A beaver? a Fish? This is so weird as it can get! When I found out that this was a comedy-Horror film, i knew why it wasn't as scary as it could be, but still the movie sucks!!!!! Its NOT funny, its not scary, its just a boring awful movie, that should be thrown away!!!! If anyone of you have seen the horror movie about the Killer Ants, you'll know that this movie is even WORSE than that. the movie about the ants did actually have a point, and did NOT just be a movie about some idiots that are just fooling around.Even another question Is the movie about the Crododile or about the persons? We see a lot to the persons, and not much to the animal thats killing almost everyone near the lake. But if we say its about the persons, Wy oh why do we not get any deep understanding of them? they just fool around and do NOT cooperate or do NOT let us know them! So to me, it shows that the director didn't know what the movie was about, and then just made it as it is.I think i know why its supposed to be a comedy. After making the Horror movie, he found out that is was so lame, the actors so stupid and bad, that he thought hey if we say its a comedy, we can be sure that no one is saying that the actors are bad, they just think they are playing bad, because its a comedy! But the fact is, its NOT a comedy! I must say that i cannot understand those who say this is a great film!

It features a giant crocodile munching up a group of wildlife experts in the middle of a large lake.  Unfortunately, the movie's written and produced by David E. Kelly, who seems to think that moviegoers everywhere will want to see some of that same humor he puts into Ally McBeal into Lake Placid.  A word to Kelly, this is a killer animal flick, and I wish to see a crocodile causing mayhem, not some immature idiots arguing over things we don't care the slightest bit about.Lake Placid doesn't even take place in the titular body of water. Instead, the setting is in Black Lake, and the film begins with a man exploring a beaver site.  Before he does anything substantial, he's bitten in half right before Sheriff Hank Keough's (Brendan Gleeson) eyes.  Keough brings in fish-and-game warden Jack Wells (Bill Pullman), and paleontologist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) comes along for the ride when she discovers the tooth Keough recovered is reptilian.The arrival of Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt) confirms to Kelly that the lake has a loose crocodile, which somehow swam all the way from Asia.  Arguments and conflicts erupt between Cyr and the others, since they obviously think he's a madman.  Finally, they discover that some old woman (Betty White) has been feeding her cows to the crocodile and is trying to protect it.  The group continues to argue over whether they should kill the crocodile or not and they come up with a plan that could trap it.  The question is whether they have the firepower and manpower to take down this 30-foot monstrosity.There's already an immediately noticeable flaw about Lake Placid.  From the beginning, we realize nobody's really in danger.  The lake's pretty far away from the town and it seems that nobody ever really comes by.  It's mentioned the crocodile's been there for six years and it all that time it's only eaten one man.  Thus, nobody is really in danger.  The deputies who are in harm are only in that position because this lame-brained group of experts want to hunt this animal down.  They don't seem to realize it's their own fault in the first place that they invaded its home.  By the end, we feel more sympathy for the crocodile than the human characters.Director Steve Miner can be credited for holding the crocodile back for quite a while, and in this respect, it's similar to Jaws.  At first, you'd think David Kelly was thinking of parodying the Jaws films, but none of his jokes are really aimed towards the crocodile plight.  He just likes to have the characters yell at each other back and forth over silly things. Bridget Fonda talks about how much she can't stand the environment in Maine and Oliver Platt's Hector Cyr keeps mentioning how fat Gleeson is while talking about how much of a deity and miracle the crocodile is.  This isn't particularly riveting dialogue and Kelly's attempts at humor are clumsy and not particularly funny.Kelly's script has more flaws than just that.  There's a lot of inconsistency and nonsense to the whole thing.  The first seen victim was chewed in half underwater, but Cyr specifically states crocodiles don't attack underwater.  Huh? He gives something of an explanation for this, but it made absolutely no sense.  That's not all.  Take into the concept of a crocodile travelling all the way to Maine from Asia.  It's unlikely to occur and no explanation is ever given for it.  Admittedly, I wouldn't be complaining about it if the movie had been fun, but since it's not, the gripe is a liable complaint.My expectations for the film were somewhere along the lines of maybe Deep Blue Sea or Anaconda, basically a silly but fast-paced ride. Unfortunately, Lake Placid only gets the former part down pat.  For an 82-minute film (and that includes the end credits!)(Based on my memory, this is the second shortest non-animated major studio release behind Army of Darkness I've seen) it's pretty dull with only a couple of laughs and crocodile attacks to punctuate the monotony.  At least the aforementioned films knew that it could only hold the audience's attention with non-stop creature attacks.Sure, Jaws didn't get down to any serious shark action until the finale but it held our attention with masterful suspense and great characters.  Lake Placid doesn't have any great characters and it's not helped by the performances.  Bill Pullman is almost non-existent; by the time the movie was over I had almost forgotten he was even in it.  Bridget Fonda has a lot of spunk as Kelly, but she's a little too annoying to be truly likable. The fact that she's cute doesn't hurt, though.  As I think of it now, if Kelly was aiming for parody, he should have looked to Calista Flockhart for the part (and part of me wonders whether or not that would have made this a more enjoyable, albeit more silly, film) Oliver Platt is a major pain, and I truly wished the crocodile took him before anyone else.  Only Brendan Gleeson registers as the sheriff, playing a fairly nice guy who seems to be the only one who understands the situation is pretty serious.It's a pity Lake Placid isn't a more entertaining movie, especially considering how great the crocodile actually looks.  Stan Winston's creature effects are truly top-notch here.  The CGI-rendered croc is impressive, but the animatronic reptile looks like the real thing.  These effects are almost always convincing, much unlike either Deep Blue Sea or Anaconda.  Other than the effects, I also liked the use of the perch attempting to fly (?!) as a signal for the crocodile's approach.Miner should have taken a more action-oriented approach.  You see, part of the reason there's almost no suspense is because it seems like no one is in danger, not even the deputies in the area.  They all camp around and Miner films it in such a style that we know the crocodile's is never going to sneak up on them.  The movie would have worked better had it focused on maybe just five characters (the extra being the most present deputy, Gare, played by Meredith Salenger) stranded in the area with the croc hunting them down.  The constant back-and-forth explorations destroy any chance of gaining momentum.  Not only that, but also interfering with creating tension are the arguments over the fate of the animal.  It's jarring to the film's attempts at suspense, and the characters sound far too confident in their chances of defeating the crocodile.Speaking of these explorations, these people aren't particularly smart. They actually decide to do some diving to find the crocodile.  What good does that do?  They don't even arm themselves with something substantial. There's even a point when the crocodile is right behind Hector and doesn't even attack him!  Of course, Wells states that the crocodile ate a cow and was satiated.  Hmm, then why did the croc attack the chopper right after Hector got on it?  Convenience so Miner and Kelly could inject some suspense and still let Hector get away safely?  Nah, they couldn't possibly get that low, could they?(minor spoiler in this paragraph)  The finale features something marginally exciting, though not nearly enough to give the boost this movie needs.  Of course, the crocodile is trapped, and Keough and Wells have to make the decision as to whether or not they should kill it.  But David Kelly doesn't want to make the audience sad by killing this poor crocodile, see, so he conveniently brings in another croc that can get blown to pieces.  Of course, stupid as these characters are, they never bother to think that one of these two crocs were females and had given birth.By the time the movie's over, you'll more than likely be glad, and maybe even tired.  As short as it is, Lake Placid felt a LOT longer than 82 minutes, never a good sign for a movie that's meant to be humorous fun.

It was good, but it did not have much gore or death, and a different ending to most traditional vicious animal films. Anyway, basically paleontologist (one who specialises in dinosaur artifacts) Kelly Scott (Jackie Brown's Bridget Fonda) is sent to Black Lake in a New England town to investigate unusual animal attacks, from evidence of a prehistoric tooth found from a victim. She, along with warden Jack Wells (Bill Pullman), millionaire crocodile expert Hector Cyr (Eraser's Oliver Platt) and grumpy Sheriff Hank Keough (Harry Potter's Brendan Gleeson) are now on the hunt for the giant, 40-foot beast that lurks below the surface, that luckily can't see completely well to attack in deeper water. The way they see to attract the Croc's attention is to use a cow from the woman who constantly feeds it, the pretty mad Mrs. Delores Bickerman (Betty White). In the end they put the Croc to sleep, and blow up a second (probably the mother) and hold it down on a truck, and the final moments see Mrs. Bickerman feeding some Croc babies (making it possible for a sequel). I think the problem with this film is not just the amount of excitement slightly lacking, but it is over quicker than you'd hope or expect, but it is still quite a fun film. Worth watching!

Kelley. Running Time 82 minutes. Rated R (for gory violence and language)By Blake French	The opening sequence in Lake Placid has a scuba diver swimming alone in a lake located in the outskirts of Maine. Meanwhile, Police Sheriff Hank Keough stays aboard in a miniature fishing boat awaiting the diver's return. As the swimmer works his business underwater, scary music plays in the background. We then receive a false alarm jump scene in which a harmless animal pops out at him. After that, we know that something terrible is going to happen. It happens. Before the audience can determine what it is, however, the camera quickly cuts to Sheriff Hank as he sees red liquid in the water below him. The diver then surfaces, screaming, and is somehow able to escape the jaws of a large animal, and climb on board with the officer to safety--with his lower torso bitten off.I'm sure you recognize this scene by now. Whether it be from one of the Jaws movies, Alligator, Anaconda, or even Deep Blue Sea. Though no matter how familiar these sequences become, there will always be a director, writer, or producer who wishes to reuse them. The fair of Lake Placid can be described by the first five minutes of the film; recycled, un-scary, and worst of all, it's written to satisfy both lovers of comedy and horror. The film may work well in some areas, but never in the appropriate places for it to succeed.  The lake in the opening is inhabited by a 30 foot alligator, which is investigated by several important characters in the film. There is Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda), a specialist in this area who is depressed because her boyfriend left her, Jack Wells (Bill Pullman), a local water and game warden, Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt), a somewhat mental scientist who believes alligators are godly, and Mrs. Delores Bickerman (Betty White), an innocent appearing elderly lady who may contribute more to the story than it seems. These characters team up for an odd ball comedy, and the alligator produces the horrific atmospheres for them to occupy.  	Basically, Lake Placid is a character movie. It contains more of a thematic plot, which revolves around the gator, than a firm through line of events. It is unfortunate that the film's character development in nearly nonexistent. The usually reliable Bill Pullman is wasted here, with his character being a stone cold, emotionally lacking, unneeded plot device without feeling or personality. The Pullman character is used to promote an interest free romantic subplot between him and Kelly. Although Fonda contains a slight introduction involving her motives for being, she in unable to shape the film's desperation towards human passion. Oliver Platt's character is also a victim of poor screen writing, developed with brief dialogue segments.	Some of the casting and a few of the performances are suitable for the film's conduct. We have the potentially effective Bill Pullman who is anything but in this case, however. He spends most of his time performing with less depth than a cardboard box. Brendan Gleeson, Betty White, and Oliver Platt give their characters personalities for the others to clash with, supplying us with several engaging and colorful comic scenes. Bridget Fonda is also able to supply her character with meager glow and charm. 	The alligator horror effects are normally short hearted and unfocused. There is too little emphasis on the characters to care about what happens to them. Thus we care even less about the conflicts regarding the alligator. When we do see the actual gator, at times, it looks quite frightening--but even then it is incapable of providing us with the appropriate tension required. The computer images are obvious, and turn out equal to the moderate quality of Anaconda. At times, Lake Placid is so enormously unbelievable it is hard to understand why television writer David E. Kelley wasted his time with this messy, shapeless motion picture. There is a mid-point comic twist and a pathetic, inconclusive closing that really makes one wonder why the filmmakers didn't play the material as straight horror rather than blending it with parody. After all, if you are a fan of horror, you probably won't rush to the theater for comic amusement. And if you like comedy, are you really going to make a trip to the multiplex to see someone lose their head in crocodile jaws? Brought to you by Twentieth Century Fox.

Today`s Wednesday and I found a piece of paper in my pocket that contained a few notes on LAKE PLACID . If I hadn`t found that piece of paper I would have had absolutely no recollection that I saw this on Saturday night . That`s forgettable LAKE PLACID is .By some irony it wasn`t really necessary for me to take notes watching this boring and predictable movie because it can be summed up with the words  JAWS rip off  featuring some dumb people getting eaten up by a crocodile . The characters are just like the one dimensional cardboard cut outs you`d expect in a film like this  A cynical cop , a female palaentogolist , a tough game warden and a rich mythological expert who`s also a philistine , you`ll never guess ( Yawn ) who ends up as dinner and who falls in love ? It could be worse though because at least LAKE PLACID doesn`t take itself seriously , but one thing that confused me is why the producers allowed some gore and bad language to creep in pushing the film`s certification to a 15 ? This could have easily have been a PG family film  "}]
