Along the way Robo crashes cars, battles robot ninjas and flies through the air like a six-ton Superman. Alas, none of it can save ROBOCOP 3, a film into which very little real effort seems to have gone.When watching ROBOCOP 3, one can't help but think the producers lazily expected the well-established Robocop brand would simply sell itself this time around. Making matters worse, they tried to move away from a more adult-style of action and sci-fi and deliver something you might watch with older kiddies. I mean, robot ninjas??? What is this, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers? This thing even attempts to deliver a do-the-right-thing message, but the whole effort is so muddled and ridiculous it can't succeed (nor should a movie like this even try).I am willing to cut movies a lot of slack, but this one's a stinker. No wonder Robo was reduced to a cheap Canadian-filmed TV series following this disaster.

Also Robocop is now as weak as a kitten, and Oh yes, and he can fly now too, Yawn! This movie simply insults the Robocop name, in every way, i can't think of a single reason to watch this film, it's another case of no sequels necessary (although Robocop 2 - wasn't all bad)3/10 "},{"Title":"One of the worst science-fiction movies ever","Date":"23 January 2005","Score":"72 out of 115 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" When I was very little, I became a fan of the first 2 Robocop films.

The story was actually good and could have worked. But they had to do what ruins a lot of other moviesadd a little kid character. It also featured a very horribly written character of a robot ninja. And without Peter Weller from the first two movies, this movie just wasn't the same. And a PG-13 rating? The whole point of the Robocop movies was to make some of the most violent and swear-filled movies you'll ever see.

First of all, the character of Robocop is played by someone else and the result is just plain embarrassing. The film is very soft on violence, which was a poor decision on the director's part because the original film is notorious for its excessiveness and loved by fans. A PG-RATED Robocop is just a desperate attempt to cash in on the wider audience, which proves that the film was made by profiteers, rather than film-makers. This film is so bad, it's literally dripping with cheese. Robocop flying is an unintentional funny moment in the film and the part where Robocop drives a car off a bridge and lands on all four wheels, is just plain ridiculous.

The movie was so unwanted that Peter Weller didn't want to reprise his role of Officer Murphy for a third time. Whilst the second film was extremely dark and depressing, the third installment swung wildly in the other direction. Two wrongs don't make a right. The director and writer Fred Dekkar should have known better. He made a couple of fun and watchable movies in the past. What ever made them click misfired on all cylinders in this boring and safe for the family sequel.Well, this movie killed it's box office draw. Nobody wanted to see a kid friendly Robocop. The next time it appeared was on the small screen in two syndicated television programs. Neither raised a big stink and Robocop went back into mothballs. A shame really because Robocop was cool. Hell, part two is a classic compared to this celluloid tripe. Recommended for die-hard Robocop fans. Other need not apply, except children who want to see Robocop in action.

Because it tries a story line with a little more thought in it? True perhaps, but that's all it's got going for it. One painfull moment follows the other. I like lists, so let's list some.<<!!!As always, SPOILERS ahead!!!>>A black woman who's not even 40 calls herself an old woman during the deportation, the deportation itself is a complete fraud (pick out a cop and follow him around. It shows that their instructions were just run in that direction and act mean, but for crying out loud, don't hurt yourselves!), the laptop reprogramming of the ED-9something, cops who don't know how to defend themselves when they've got guns and the punkers got sticks, robocop who loses every fight he's in, dream sequences on screen like a soap opera (in the first movie they were just a read-out of the brain activity. A lot more real), Robocop obviously not weighting anymore then a normal man these days (2 of the rebels carry him) and the japanese man responsible for the killing can just walk around among his victims, never in danger. And do I even have to mention the flying he's doing?Add unmemorable villains and not one engaging action sequence and this movie has really nothing going for it. The decission to have no blood in the movie is almost funny when they have no trouble having a couple of suicides in the story. The story itself, isn't that worth it then, one might say? Let's just say it's impressive how they can make an almost epic theme reminding of the holocaust so incredible boring and unadmospheric. I certainly didn't care for any character, that's for sure.At least Robocop 2 had action and humour going for it.2/10 (hey, it still is robocop) "},{"Title":"Easily the worst of the franchise, but a boatload of fun none the less!","Date":"14 April 2007","Score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" Before I begin, let me get this out in the open Robocop 3 is easily the worst movie of the trilogy.OK, now the rest of the review.Though this is the worst movie of the series, Robocop 3 manages to find a way to redeem itself (be it intentionally or unintentionally) by being incredibly cheesy, and ultimately a load of fun! The film doesn't even really seem to be a direct continuation of the series, though it does reference the first movie several times via flashbacks. The story is just about as dull as it could get, and the acting leaves much to be desired. Not to mention, the one saving grace this film could have had (special effects) does nothing to help save the movie from falling to B-Movie status.I'm not sure why Peter Weller was not brought back for this one, but I think he was wise to avoid it. Robocop has been reduced to cheesy one-liners, and badly choreographed fight scenes. However, I think this adds to the movie's charm. The film seems to take a very tongue-in-cheek look into the world of Robo, and this saves it from being a complete failure. Also, it seems as if the writers or director were watching a lot of Japanese anime, one of the main villains in the film is a ninja who is seemingly unstoppable; many of his scenes are so stylized you'd swear you're watching an anime. Rip Torn also adds to the film's silliness as the head of the corrupt corporation, OCP. He makes the main conflict in the film not even seem threatening due to the fact that he isn't menacing at all.Overall I'd say this film is more of a comedy than a sci-fi flick. It contains so many cheesy moments that it's best enjoyed with a small group of friends (my close friend opined once This is what Mystery Science Theater 3000 was made for, how right he was). If you are a fan of the series because of the grittiness and realism displayed in the first, avoid this entry. However, if you're looking for a good cheesy popcorn style sci-fi film, by all means, get some friends together and have fun! This film was made to be laughed at!

I think this film is cool. It is flawed, but it is still far cooler than RoboCop 2 (or RoboCrap as I like to call it). The drama in this film makes it unique amongst its predecessors, and it is much better than the likes of 'Batman Forever' (another film unique in its own franchise). **SPOILERS**The plot sees OCP going ahead with Delta City. They hire a mercenary group called 'Rehab' to 'escort' the people from their homes and into rehabilitation camps. The police hate this idea and once a stray bullet hits officer Ann Lewis, RoboCop is seriously p***ed off. The plot is simple, but it is superior in its simplicity. It is the campy one-liners and gags that let this film down on more than one occasion. Things like RoboCop commandeering a pimp-mobile and Sergeant Reid having to deal with a drag queen prostitute are just a few of the things that had me fuming at the television screen. I'd say it is for this reason that a lot of people hate this film with such a passion. Another reason that this repelled Robo-fans was because it had very little political satire other than the fact that the main characters were trying to beat the system for the good of the people. There is very little 'MediaBreak Advertisement' sequences, and even the ones that are shown have strong relevance to the story. This is probably because this film is aimed squarely at children so that more action figures can be sold. However, I quite enjoyed the drama of the people rebelling against the corporate monster OCP for the rights to their own homes. I especially loved the part where even the Detroit Police Department thought that OCP had gone out of line, throwing their badges at an OCP executive, and leaving the building to go and help the civilians reclaim their homes. This is something you don't usually get in a superhero film (if you want to call any of the RoboCop films 'superhero' films). **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!**It is pretty obvious that they gave RoboCop a removable gun/flamethrower attachment (it attached to his hand) to sell action figures. The same applies with the jet pack seen at the end of the film. However, I felt that they were incorporated into the film quite nicely, and the flying scene, however fake, is pretty cool if you take it with a pinch of salt. Especially with Basil Poledouris' theme music booming in the background.**END SPOILERS** Overall, RoboCop 3 does not deserve to be in the 'Bottom One-Hundred Films' list. I believe it should be in 'The Best Sequels' list. If you enjoy RoboCop because he's a superhero and not because the films he appears in (usually) have strong political satire in them, then this is the film for you. 6/10.

If not, don't proceed until you see those firstRobocop 3 (1992) picks an unknown number of years after the events of part 2, Cain's gang and his Nuke Drug has been obliterated and Robocain has been defeated by our hero. The Old Man from the previous two films is gone (either died or resigned after the events of Robocop 2; the movie doesn't say) and is replaced by the CEO (Rip Torn). The Delta City Project inaugurated in the previous film is falling behind schedule and OCP incurs in debt, leading to its takeover by the Japanese corp. of Kanemitsu. Meanwhile, they adopt increasingly forceful methods to get back on track by hiring mercenaries called the Rehabs led by Robert McDagget (John Castle) to evacuate areas for demolition and send the locals to correctional facilities. A band of freedom fighters spring up, Robocop and Anne Lewis track them down after seeing a little girl joining them in an abandoned church. Unbeknowst to them, the Rehabs have tracked them down, and orders them to leave the building to them. Robocop and Anne Lewis refuse, but when Anne gets seriously injured (and dies a few minutes later), he quits the force and joins the rebellion, while undergoing structural repairs in his programme.Robocop 2 may have shocked some viewers for its excessive violence, but it is better than this one. The storyline is more coherent than the last film in the sense that all main ideas make it to the end but it's too simplistic. While Part 2 was ultra-violent and gloomy, this one went into the opposite direction. Sure the absence of the first two films' graphic violence would make it more appealing for kids, but this movie just has little to make up for it; it starts off very promising but it gets sillier as the it progresses, culminating in a ridiculous fight between Robocop and the Samurai, which is a far cry from the excellent finale between Robocop and Robocain in the the second movie, giving the impression that the filmmakers have run out of money by that point.However, Robocop 3 still has some worthwhile moments to spare it from becoming a candidate for MST3K. Most of the action sequences save the aforementioned fight are well-staged and creative, and the film has some creative use of CGI. Robocop's new gadgets-- the jet-pack and his cannon-- are worthy additions, and our hero still knows how to make an entrance (diving from the highest level of a parking lot and dropping down 10 storeys below).Peter Weller, however, did not reprise the role, most likely because he has grown tired of having to walk into that baggy costume for hours and hours on end and sweating buckets in the process, and he's replaced by Robert John Burke. Burke is a worthy successor to Weller, mimicking his movements down to the smallest details, but it just doesn't feel the same without him.Bottom line Robocop 3 is the worst of the series, but it's not as terrible as some people tend to exaggerate.Trivia the beautiful Jill Hennessy appears here as Robocop's leading programmer just before becoming famous as Kincaid in Law and Order and later in Crossing Jordan.

I mean Robocop 3 lost the benefit of being an eighties action film so granted the violence and foul language would be toned down because suddenly the political correctness of the 90's was in full swing. So that meant making Robocop more family friendly. They also lost Peter Weller from the lead which I didn't realize how great he was as Robocop until he wasn't him anymore. I have to wonder if screenplay writer Frank Miller was angry at the creators of Robocop so he spun this tale as a cruel prank because Miller is no slouch at writing, he is a legendary comic writer (300, Sin City, X-Men, etc.) and the story for Robocop 3 borders on ridiculous. All of the dark gritty atmosphere is pretty much gone from the original film, the tongue in cheek political humor is gone as well despite some off attempts to do exactly that. And it is true what reviewers have said that Robocop has suddenly become a complete weakling. He spends so much of the film repeatedly falling on his robo butt and trying to get back up. He's lost all of his cool factor, all of his heavy hitting super hero instincts.Robert John Burke takes over the robo suit as Robocop and Alex Murphy. He just doesn't seem to have a handle on the character and doesn't give as much effort as Peter Weller did. Maybe it's because the first two films were so much better but Burke just isn't cut out for Robocop and spends most of his time trying to get back up on his feet. Rip Torn takes the helm away from The Old Man as head of OCP. Torn is a decent actor but he doesn't seem to have near the screen presence that Dan O'Herlihy had in the original films. They do mention The Old Man several times so to close his portion of the story. John Castle is one of the villains in the story as McDaggett, yet another corrupt OCP Officer working to rid the city of Robocop. He's okay, a little strung out and insane but decent enough. He doesn't hold a candle to previous villains in the series. Nancy Allen returns thankfully as Robocop's partner Lewis and the film does give her character something of closure so I give them kudos for that. Robert DoQui also returns for his third go around as Sergeant Reed and for the first time in the three films he really gets into the action which is terrific. Jill Hennessy joins the cast as Dr. Marie Lazarus who personally takes care of Robocop. Her performance is a little bland as she often is in her roles. It's a big cast with some decently memorable faces but I can't cover them all here.So here is why Robocop 3 is NOT the disastrously horrendous film that some make it out to be. First of all it ends the trilogy with a final big battle between OCP and the Detroit Police Department which essentially brings OCP down. It also brings back some of the familiar faces from the series and gives closure to the story on Lewis although her and Burke just don't have the chemistry that her and Weller had as partners. The story is decent enough and simple enough to follow but it just doesn't hold up to the previous two films. The entire aspect of Robocop flying is so ridiculous and they surely had to know that it was ridiculous. If it ain't broke don't fix it and they do fix the unbroken recipe which essentially ruins the series. It is true that Robocop 3 was a fall from grace and this film felt like the quality of a TV Movie which is maybe why all future Robocop installments hit Television. A rather bland disappointment. 6/10 "},{"Title":"This is not RoboCop 3","Date":"11 June 2008","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" This movie is like a black sheep in the RoboCop flock.

Peter Weller had moved on and Robert Burke had taken over as the ironclad police officer. According to the majority of viewers, RoboCop 3 was garbage. Turns out though, I liked it. Maybe not as much as the first for various reasons but at least this movie carried forward with the story of Alex Murphy. Unlike the first sequel that drove us in circles.RoboCop is back one more time to save the city of old Detroit. But this time, it is on a much bigger scale. It is not mentioned to how the old man of OCP disappeared, but it's assumed that he finally died. Now in charge of OCP is the CEO, played by actor Rip Torn, and it's up to him to make sure a place called Cadillac Heights is ready for deconstruction within a certain date. So to remove the people from this area requires a group of officers called The Rehabs. But as the audience will discover early in the intro, that these officials aren't very helpful nor do they care.The head of the rehabs is Paul McDaggett, played by John Castle. John Castle is good as a selfless official but that's all he is. He's not a Boddicker and not a Cain. Burke as RoboCop isn't a bad fit either. Yes, it would have been better to still have Weller in the suit but hey, you do with what you have. And yes, Burke makes Robo sound funny but it's really not that annoying. As long as the voice isn't high or super low pitched, it shouldn't be that big a deal. Even when Robo's helmet is off, the make-up department did a swell job having him look like he did in the last 2 films.Co-starring Burke are some of the last remaining characters from the cast of the first film. Felton Perry is still playing Johnson, only this time, he seems like he's having a hard time picking sides. He's been apart of OCP for a long time but soon realizes how corrupt the company has become along with its massive dept. Of course I don't understand how he didn't see that with half his fellow co-workers biting bullets and attempting to fly out windows. Nancy Allen is still around as Anne Lewis, Murphy's first and only partner. Even sergeant Reed (Robert DoQui from the last 2 films) is still there. He too realizes the corruption of OCP and decides to take a stand. It's nice to see OCP finally lose its foundation.One thing in particular I did not find enjoyable is the lack of bloodshed during this film. The director of this sequel is Fred Dekker and it surprised me that he allowed this film to be rated PG-13. Why Dekker? You made Night of the Creeps (1986) and that was rated R? I mean at least you still could have had the screenplay release some four- letter words to get it an R rating. And it's not productive to make a sequel and have its rating changed from all the others that came before it. I understand that the reason is to have a broader audience of ages but how does it help when the kids don't even know who RoboCop is or what his background was? It's a plan of failure and Dekker should have seen that.Not to mention that RoboCop has a machine gun that he can now attach to his body. God that would have been cool to see if this film was rated R! Plus, he can fly now too. Yeah big deal to some of you skeptics but it really is a nice addition. Basil Poledouris is back as well, to do the his noted music again for this franchise. So that's a plus. And the best part is by the end of this film, Alex Murphy at least finds a group of people who don't treat him like an investment but more like a human. Isn't that what we wanted from the past two films? I did.Having the last installment being rated PG-13 was a wrong move but it can be seen that Dekker's team tried hard to bring back the other elements that made the first film a hit. And for most, it should please its fans for at least making that attempt.

Well, I guess this was the case, I think we could all relate. But yeah, this movie was very over the top and very silly along with the dramatic time change.I'm guessing it must be the future due to the futuristic equipment, even though everything is very dated. So now another part of OCP is on the case of destroying Detroit by making people homeless and jobless, but don't worry! Robocop is on the case! He looses his faithful partner to the evil corporation and tries to save the homeless while trying to stay together for the evil robocops that Japan has sent over. Can Robocop defeat OCP once again? And by the way, you'd think after all the evil talk from the first and second Robocop movies, OCP would have gone out of business by now.Robocop 3 is very over the top again, like the line stated in the movie Just follow the explosions to see where Robocop was. But I think there must be someone out there who is absolutely in love with this movie or the trilogy itself, as for me?

The very fact that it's the third in the series, that it had the violence toned down, and it's not Peter Weller seems to have really put peoples backs up. It shouldn't, and those people who seem to be on some vitriolic campaign to slate this film are ignoring it's most important merit. It's plot. The plot carries on the established Robocop saga, in a far better way than it predecessor did so, and I think it's about time a little light was shone on this fact. Mc Daggett is a strong and believable villain and Robert Burke did an excellent job in replacing Weller. The plot is extremely well structured and paced, and tells a genuinely interesting story of corporate greed stampeding over peoples rights. Now I'm not saying Robocop 3 had any big social message, but the rebels were entirely believable, Robocop's side switching was handled very well, and the whole story just gelled naturally. It wasn't exempt from problems of course. Niko was maybe a bit to much for most Robocop fans to accept, the SFX and action scenes were well wanting of a couple more mill being spent on them, and the end fight between Robo and the Otomos just flat out sucked. However, what should matter to most people is the story and acting. On both of these levels Robocop 3 scores and I genuinely wish people could see past the number 3 at the end of the title and give this film more of a chance.

If they don't clear the entire suburb of Cadillac Heights within four days, OCP's stocks will fall & the company will be ruined. Amidst this, RoboCop has been trying to defeat the Splatterpunks, a violent gang of thugs who have been attacking the police. When he disregards a direct order to chase a group of resistance fighters who have stolen weapons from a police armoury in order to rescue his partner Anne Lewis from the Splatterpunks, the head of OCP's Security Concepts division orders RoboCop's head technician Dr. Marie Lazarus to erase his memories in order to make him less prone to violating orders. But Lazarus refuses to do so & is fired. When Lewis is killed by the mercenaries OCP has hired to kick people out of their homes, RoboCop joins forces with the resistance in order to stop the mercs & the Splatterpunks, who have joined forces to complete their mission.The original ROBOCOP was a science fiction masterpiece of the late 1980s, a film that has become legendary for its biting satire of what was considered to a future where corporations run amok & take over the running of whole cities, one such corporation trying to defeat crime by resurrecting a dead cop into an unstoppable cyborg who then goes after corrupt members of the very company that built him. The film became a blockbuster & a cult classic & spawned a whole franchise as well as matching the likes of THE TERMINATOR for sci-fi influence on the genre ever since.After the underrated ROBOCOP 2, the franchise practically blew its foot off with the likes of RoboCop 3. This sequel was universally panned by just about everyone & most die-hard Robo fans consider it to be utterly worthless. I personally don't entirely agree &#x96; the film has some game attempt to up the stakes on the story, with the cyborg taking on violent punks, corporate mercenaries & even a number of android ninjas in a story that should have been regarded as top-notch. But what looked on paper as excellent only ended up as significantly flawed in execution. Director Fred Dekker handles the action scenes well enough, even if he fails to match the legendary ultraviolence that the first two films were renowned for, but in his quest to make the film more 'family friendly', makes several attempts at putting childish humour into the mix. The scene where the young computer genius manages to reprogram an ED-209 robot was kind of cute but the rest of the gags just plain clunked.As for RoboCop himself, Dekker has made several critical mistakes that cause the film to crash & burn. Robert Burke does a pretty passable job of playing the cyborg but he is not Peter Weller in the slightest. Plus he has a really big chin that is distracting whenever he's not wearing his visor & chinguard. The first two films pitted RoboCop against some formidable machines &#x96; the ED-209 in the original & the replacement cyborg in the second but here the Japanese android ninjas are just plain mediocre &#x96; able to be defeated very easily & only have superior speed to make up for their weaknesses. RoboCop is also severely weakened in terms of toughness that is really annoying &#x96; he managed to survive severe punishment in the first two films but here is so weak that a mere rifle grenade can knock his power systems down significantly.The acting is okay for the most part. The only person I found to be subpar was Rip Torn, whose buffoonish portrayal of a cowardly & incompetent CEO was really grating on the nerves. Nancy Allen does a good job as usual but is criminally underutilised to the point that Dekker felt that killing the character off would help in balancing the film, something that didn't entirely work. Also underused were the Splatterpunks themselves, an interestingly wacked-out band of psychos who only appear in two scenes yet are built up into a major menace, something that fails badly. If you've got young children you want to introduce to the RoboCop franchise, this would be a pretty safe bet but there are some animated spinoffs that would do the job even better.

Does the third film in the RoboCop franchise have what it takes to stand side by side with its predecessors?Well no, not really. They main problem here, once again, is the story. The original film was a brutal, gore-filled satire. It was aimed for adults and for what it was, it took itself surprisingly seriously. It questioned the meaning of humanity, the morality of stripping away free will for efficiency's sake, what it meant to uphold law and order to the best of your abilities. Whereas this movie simply thinks it's cool that there's this robot dude that has all these gadgets, shoots really good and beats up bad guys. It's merely a cheap superhero storyline given a paint of RoboCop. A thin paint, because even the character doesn't feel authentic, siding with rebels and actively going against the law and order.And this is a shame, because on the technical side of things, it still feels like a genuine thing. It has the feel of a RoboCop film, for the most part. Sure the main actor has changed, but I really couldn't tell most of the time. Sure the monotone helps hide the differences, but still, good job Robert John Burke. Furthermore, the set designs, the music, the feel of the action and so on, it all works. But it's hard to remain invested when you're expecting an adult science fiction story and the movie is trying to treat you like a fifteen-year-old.This is a heavily flawed film. It cannot be recommended to any hardcore RoboCop fan, because it betrays its source material so badly. Yet as a standalone film it does deliver some good action scenes and interesting visuals. It'll keep you entertained, if you just let it. So, not for everyone, but personally I don't begrudge seeing it.

But alas if there's money to be made then another sequel will come our way, but it's not always a bad thing. 'Robocop 2' wasn't a big a smash as it's predecessor was and many fans felt it was a step down, but it must have done well enough to please Orion Pictures because soon after another sequel was in production. Once again there would be a new director at the helm, which is not nearly as disappointing as the recasting of the title character. Then the company had some serious money troubles and the film was shelved for a year, which usually is not a good sign. Well surprise surprise, 3 is actually the best of the sequels.Pros Most of the performances are solid, especially Nancy Allen's. Pretty good story, stronger than part 2s. Excellent production design. Basil Poledouris, who scored 2, returns to compose a great score that reintroduces some classic themes. Lightening pace. No shortage of exciting action scenes.

Frank Miller's story is on the money, but it seems to have been chopped up and spit out into this mess.  Oh, it's a good idea to have Robo team up with a group of rebels against OCP, but it's not fully realized throughout the movie.  I don't know, you just don't get the feeling it's working!  And why kill off Lewis? And what happened to Murphy trying to find his humanity?  And why is this a PG-13, not a bloody, violent R movie?Robert Burke is okay as Murphy.  Still, he doesn't have the voice, charisma, or jawline that Peter Weller has that made RoboCop unique, and memorable. I also really missed Dan O'Herlihy's presence as the Old Man, OCPs head honcho.  Rip Torn is a good actor, but he misses the point of his part. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty good, except the little girl.

Robocop 2 was, well, torture to watch. It was absolute garbage. Robocop 3 however, brought new life to the franchise - the loss of Peter Weller as Murphy was a blow but Robert Burke's portrayal almost lived up to that of Weller's.

Hiring a group of mercenaries from the Amazon Nuclear War, O.C.P have six days to clear it for demolition, or O.C.P's stock plummet and they're ruined. A small band of residents do not take kindly to this and are determined that the destruction of their homes does not go ahead. Officer Alex Murphy (Robocop) sides with them, since the mercenaries (called the 'Rehab Unit') killed Officer Lewis and nearly put Murphy off line.    Once again, it appears Frank Miller's vision has been taken over by a director, intent on aiming this for a kiddie market. The story is very interesting (due to Miller, I suspect) but Fred Dekker reduces the blood letting, the language is cleaned up, and there's a cute little girl who befriends Murphy. Aggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh. Hell, there's even new attachments for Murphy (jetpack, removable hand, machine gun) and he's lost the inner turmoil that made him someone to root for and care for.    A note to M.G.M the best way to look at Robocop is as Batman. Both are similar characters, and both were destroyed by eager production companies intent on making a few bucks from eager kids, and then sell them as action figures.    The action scenes, although pretty short, are quite enjoyable, in that Saturday night 'nothing on T.V, so we'll go and get out a film' sort of way. The whole film has a cheap look about it. This doesn't suit, since you need big action scenes and gunplay and a futuristic look in Robocop. The ninjas, Otomo, are interesting villans. They are like Japanese Terminators, and would have been great in a few more scenes.

And I believe that by the use of the T.V screens as a technique for the story to progress and also by the concept of a future city, where the criminal run amock. So as the sequels are written by Miller himself, this technique even accentuates further. This second sequel is perhaps better than the first one, due to a much tight script and story.

That would be the wtf did I just watch chamber.If you remember the old 80s TV action shows... like The A-Team, Spenser For Hire, MacGyver, etc... you're halfway there. These were shows that didn't have a lot of substance but were fun to watch anyway. The plots were mostly predictable and the execution was corny, but that's precisely why we watch them.Robocop 3 is an unusual return to that style (whether by design or not). Plot is linear, scenes are bright, dialogue is snippy but not particularly witty, and dramatic/disturbing scenes are glossed over, almost as if it's made for a PG-13 audience (WHOA, I just realized this IS PG-13... while the first 2 films were rated R).Yet the film also injects spots of extreme violence and creepy dark humor... like the 2 or 3 comedic scenes of people committing suicide, which did make me laugh out loud, I admit. Those were the scenes I liked best because they remained true to the original dark satire of the original Robocop.I still don't view the Robocop trilogy as an action story but rather a brilliant dark comedy. Robocop 3 has the same bizarre news briefs and hilarious commercials peppered throughout, and although it's not as thick as in the original, the vibe is still there. But the overall feeling is one of campy 80s. Check out the hilarious 80s hairstyles & clothes (denim jackets... dear lord I thought we burned all of them!). Really bizarre.

R3 decided to water the violence down and make it a family action film. This convinced most viewers that they wouldn't like it. It's a stereotype that action films are typically brainless and unfortunately, the films that try to break that stereotype aren't a financial success most of the time. So it seems that the stereotype is here to stay. Most people clearly missed the social commentaries that R3's making. It mentions that OCP is kicking people out of their homes, all in the name of making the city 'safer'. Message being that politicians only want to make the world safer for those who are rich, no one else. Did the audience miss this message when they call the film dumb? ******SPOILERS******** Officer Lewis' murder follows, which was anti-climactic. No slow motion screams, none of that BS. Just real, surprising, wasteful violence that shocks the audience in the sudden way it's carried out. The OCP agent was tired of her, so he decided to execute her on the spot, which was a waste of a great person, but then again, all deaths of good people are. Not that there isn't drama. Robo's frustration is obvious when he's unable to attack his partner's murderers, succeeding in being able to blow up the OCP agents' van and providing his side with a brief respite from the enemy's onslaught. He then carries his dying partner away, knowing that all his strength, armor and firepower is for naught, as she's dying in his arms anyway. One of the best lines anywhere is when Robo tells Lewis that she doesn't need to be scared because it won't hurt for much longer. So the good guys took a hit, and finally, it's time for Robo to hit back. The director copies one of the styles that made Robocop 1 so successful, where in R1 we had the privilege of accompanying Robo as he patrolled the city and searched for everyday criminals to apprehend. There's nothing wrong with director Dekker (sp) copying Verhoevan's (sp) style, since if it worked so well in R1, why not do it in R3 also? The audience that's been fed what feels like ages of anxiety from OCP now gets its (and Robo's) wish as Robo is finally able to delete Directive 4, finally allowing him to hunt down OCP employees just like he hunted down criminals in R1. Thus, we again can ride shotgun with Robo as he mows down OCP agents, and find out more about his new weapons. It's worthy to note that one scene from R3 is a carbon copy of a scene from R1, where R1 Robo confronted two men who were attacking a woman at knifepoint, and shot one man in the groin before the second surrendered. In R3, we have 2 male OCP agents who are harassing a teenaged prostitute, only this time using their status as power rather than a weapon. In both scenes, the audience is treated to seeing Robo's shadow as he approaches the horrible scene, ready to make it right. Only difference is his reaction, where instead of Your Move, Creep, it's Didn't You Hear? The Lady Said No!, followed by gunshots into the two OCP agents' kevlar vests, that sends them flying through glass. To all those Robocop 3 haters is &#150; you actually want MORE than this in a film??!! That's not the end of it. Following the rescue of the teenage prostitute, Robo tells her that she needs to get home, because she's breaking curfew! That's one of the sharpest social remarks I heard, where there's a curfew that's supposed to reduce crime by mandating teenagers to stay home at night, but obviously isn't working because the majority of crime is being committed by 'law-enforcing' OCP agents! **********END SPOILERS********* There's a lesson in there for people who thinks that quick, overnight solutions that simply sound good will work when applied to complicated problems. Real solutions are slow and difficult, not quick and easy. Not to say that Robocop 3 is a great film. It's not. Robocop 1 was a great film, but R2 and R3 *are* good films in their own right, and a good Trilogy together. But there *are* drawbacks to it, starting with the budget. It's painfully obvious that this film was under-funded, proven by the sets, special effects, and that tiny actors in R1 have huge parts here. Also, while watered-down violence to make a film family-oriented isn't a bad thing, the violence here is a bit TOO watered-down. And last, Robocop went from cyborg killing machine to compassionate social worker too easily. Considering how many people he casually (though rightly) killed in the past, it would've been more appropriate if he had felt confused at the feeling of having an orphaned girl embrace him for comfort, rather than instantly knowing that he needs to gently place his hand on top of the back of her head. The message there is clear&#150; that simply blowing villains away won't solve the crime problem, and we need to make sure that regular people don't turn into villains themselves. While the message is true, Robo should've needed more time to become a social worker than the ten minutes he was given on air before his personality switched. See it for yourself, then decide.

I thought it was quite decent. Let's discuss the reasoning via Pros and cons.Pros the movie itself fits right in the time-line with the first two RoboCop movies. We know that OCP is the big villain in all three of them because of their idea of wanting to take over Detroit with their Delta City design which would involve taking out old neighborhoods (as the character Mayor Cuzak pointed out in RoboCop 2). In the this installment, it seems that OCP tries to actually GO THROUGH with the Delta City redesign by means of brute force through a group know as the Rehabs who forcefully drive individuals and families out of their homes and on buses just so they can build their Delta City. Robocop with his new gadgets and tools made by Dr Lazarus take the side of the citizens as any good police officer would and finally deal a final blow to OCP towards the end. Plus we get to see a better character development out of RoboCop and Alex Murphy.I actually thought it was rather action packed and the plot line was pretty clear. You want a horrible movie? Watch From Justin to Kelly or 50 Shades of Grey!!! Robocop 3 is way better than those two.Cons The plot line seemed a BIT predictable and Peter Weller was not there to reprise his role as RoboCop. Also sucked that Officer Lewis gets killed by OCP. I kind of zoned out at the non-action parts, but nonetheless, the whole movie was watchable.Give it the benefit of the doubt and try watching it before knocking it.

Robocop 2 was a flawed , but decent sequel that was almost universally hated by the audiences and the critics. Too bad , because it stayed true to the original. It didn't had the freshness , depth or heart of the first one , yet the violent action and dark satire was still there. The franchise still had potential and I believe that with some effort there was still a chance for interesting next installments. Unfortunately the Orion studio had financial problems . They decided to make Robocop 3 as a family friendly action movie rated PG-13 in desperate attempt to gain as wide audience as it is possible. Robocop 3 was filmed in 1991, but was not released until end of 1993 due to production company Orion going bankrupt. The result ? A movie that is one of the worst movies EVER and a final nail to the franchise coffin.Making a Robocop 3 movie with PG-13 rating makes just as much sense as making a porn movie with no sex at all ( maybe with some brief nudity here and there). ITS TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT of the original movie ! It has no heart, no brains, sly social commentary and no hard violence. Robocop 3 became the very thing that first two movies were often laughing at &#x96; a politically correct hero in a gutless , soulless and brainless Hollywood movie.To be honest a PG-13 Robocop 3 movie COULD work. The story has some potential and you can make a exciting and deep PG-13 action movie (The Dark knight). Unfortunately the whole movie seems to be aimed at kids and has a cartoon approach to it that just doesn't works. I'm amazed that this even is rated PG-13 , not PG.Peter Weller made a wise decision not returning to the role of Robo and choosing Naked lunch to do instead. I recommend to watch that movie instead of Robocop 3 . It may not be for everyone , but at least it's entertaining. Orion tried to hire Michael Dudikoff (American ninja) , but ended with Robert Burke . I can't say anything else about him except that he was in this movie. And that for some reason the studio modified his voice so it sounds annoying. Dan O'Herlihy, the old man from the first two films, does not appear in this film. The rest of the regular cast is back , unfortunately they don't have too much to do.Robocop here is basically a zombie with no personality. He also disappears for a large part of the movie. The regular cast has very little screen time and awful dialogue to work with. The new characters are annoying , especially Nico &#x96; kid genius hacker. The main villain is not one bit interesting or menacing. The acting here is awful with people either underplaying or overplaying their parts.The story here takes some elements from what comic book writer Frank Miller prepared for Robocop 2 . Mind that both Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 were heavily rewritten and have only few elements from Miller's original script. The story here could work. Unfortunately the screenplay is filled with cheap humor , predictability and stupidity. I found a site on internet which points out that Robocop 3 has faults in every scene ! The direction by Fred Dekker is apathetic. The pacing is lackluster. The action scenes are pathetic. The special effects are embarrassing , especially when you consider that Jurassic Park was in theaters that same year.This movie deserves every bad comment it gets. There are no redeeming qualities to this junk. After this movie there were two lame TV shows and cartoon. The franchise was slaughtered. I give it 1/10.

The new CEO of Omni Consumer Products (Rip Torn) recruits a crack team of mercenaries led by Paul McDaggett (John Castle) to evict the citizens from their homes. However, some of the citizens form a rebel alliance and fight back against OCP and the mercenaries.Ahhh here we have Robocop 3 which is kindly referred to as the turkey of the franchise. Although this third film is far from perfect I do think that it's unfairly maligned and I will attempt to explain why I'm prepared to defend it...First of all if we begin with the story; here we basically have the entire focus of OCP and their greed which is pretty much what the first film explored. I think that's what gives it the edge over the second film as I found the story stupid in the second film whereas it was better in this film. Think about it you're more likely to get on side with a bunch of rebel fighters who are trying to protect their homes as opposed to a bunch of violent drug-pushers. Given the fact that Peter Weller was responsible for making Robocop something of an icon it was a brave move for Burke to accept the role in this third film. To his credit, Burke does a very good job and was every bit as good as Weller in my opinion. Granted it was a risk re-casting the role, but I personally felt that it paid off here. Another strong aspect of this film is that the writers made it more of a human story and explored Robocop's emotional psyche more; examples of this are Robocop's decision to disobey an order to go and rescue Lewis OR Robocop's decision not to tell Niko that her parents were dead. Robocop 3 is notably less violent than the first two films which may disappoint those with a lust for blood. I myself have no problem with blood and violence, but I think it was toned down here to create a more human story. I also suspect that the writers perhaps didn't want to create too much of a copycat sequel. This film also has so much camp value that's almost impossible not to like this film; Robocop is given a lot of dry dialogue here and some of the lines that he delivers are cheesy, but very funny as well (this camp humour was present in the first two films, but there seemed to be more of it here). The final line in this film was probable one of the most memorable that I've come across and was also very funny. Are there any problems here? Well as Churchill the dog would say 'Oh Yes'...... The first half of the film is dull and lifeless and was a bit of a slog to get through. Thankfully though the second half is much stronger so this isn't a major criticism. I thought the inclusion of a flight pack for Robocop was a ridiculous idea. I also thought the inclusion of the Splatter Punks was a bit pointless and unnecessary. Some of the performances were woeful(particularly from Rip Torn who I felt was miscast here as he lacked the menace that the original old man had in the first 2 films). I also found it hard to take him serious as he reminded me of Terry Thomas with that stupid moustache. Aside from Burke, the only other performance that I rated in this film was that of Paul McDaggett who did give the film some of the menace that we saw in Robocop and Robocop 2. The robot ninja character could have been developed better and the fight scenes between him and Robocop were ridiculous, anti-climatic and the resolution was rather predictable. Overall then this is a mixed bag of a film, but for me the human story and the camp value combined together made this to be a fairly enjoyable film or possibly even a guilty pleasure. Yeah it has its problems, but I don't believe that it is deserved of its terrible reputation. I actually thought it was a slight improvement on Robocop 2, but it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original Robocop.

That face in the background... could he pucker those lips anymore??

OCP turns on its own people and merges with a Japanese corporation, implementing a rehab military force to evict Detroit citizens so they can take over the city. RoboCop, really doesn't do very much.So for starters, Peter Weller doesn't reprise the lead role, and while this doesn't affect it greatly; the mask is pretty well enclosing, but you do notice it. RoboCop has more lines, and it is really surprising how badly acted Robert John Burke's mouth is... he juts his chin out as if to fit the costume! It looks idiotic.The character of Alex Murphy continues to be mistreated, RoboCop 3 feels like a cash in worse than the second film; they have so little idea what to do with his character, they bench him for most of the film! Enter Nikko, a ten year old girl who can hack into and reprogram ED-209 units (for example), and a host of other characters who form a resistance force against OCP. Nancy Allen returns as Murphy's partner Anne, but is criminally underused.The villains are hopeless. They just are. We have the most stock British bad guys I have seen in a long time, allied with shadowy Japanese businessmen who send ninjas (yes, actual ninjas) to defeat RoboCop. Okay, so RoboCop taking on ninjas, as cumbersome as he is... could be exciting right? Well, the film builds it up all right. Massive, massive disappointment.The tone of the film is completely off. I said RoboCop 2 was lacking Paul Verhoeven's satire? Well this film proved me wrong! The humour here just... dies. It literally dies. Its deader than Elvis. My god. You'd have to be drunk or high to appreciate it. A man who is in the police station shouts at the sergeant RoboCop?? You got an AlienCop too? How about a GhostCop?? What... what does that even mean? How's the violence, you ask, it has a 15 certificate after all? I actually don't know why it has a 15, this is easily a 12A by today's standards. Sure there's a few bloody gunshots and splats of red on people, but otherwise this is virtually kid friendly. Crime in Detroit is initially shown with a lady pushing a trolley of empty cans, only for her trolley to be hit by a car and for someone to mug her. Oh. My. God. Someone call RoboCop, quick! He'll save her, diving a pink cadillac, that cartoonishly falls apart. That also happens...This is the Terminator Rise of the Machines of the RoboCop series, and I feel bad for Alex Murphy. I feel bad that his story was never told, that screenwriters just got lazy and wrote a shoddy shooter script with no heart at all. This was the first time I watched this film, I'd seen the other two, and honestly I wish I hadn't; it is embarrassing for the character.

RoboCop 3 sadly, is no exception. OCP has begun to move forward in their master plan to create a better Detroit, this plan is known as Delta City. Unfortunately for the citizens of Detroit, this means destroying their homes. There is strong opposition to this, so OCP deploys armed mercenaries known as Rehabs. Their job is remove people from their homes by force. One of these people, is a computer whiz kid named Nikko. After her parents are arrested by the rehabs, she is found and taken in by the leader of the resistance movement. Meanwhile, it is revealed that OCP has been bought out by a Japanese corporation. (This comes into play later) So a short time later, RoboCop and Lewis track Nikko down at an old church. Unfortunately so have the rehabs and their leader, McDaggett. He and the rest of the rehabs have orders to kill all the people in the church, but RoboCop and Lewis refuse to stand down. RoboCop can't fire on the rehabs because of Directive 4 (I'll explain what this is later.) McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs open fire on them and thus, Officer Anne Lewis is killed. I'm sure many of you can guess why this infuriates me on multiple levels! Not only does RoboCop do absolutely NOTHING to save the life of his friend and partner, but the biggest problem, is that her death has zero meaning or purpose! This is one of my favorite things to complain about in a bad movie or sequel. If you're going to have a main character die, IT MUST HAVE A PURPOSE!!! For example in Star Trek II, Spock dies to save the lives of The Enterprise's crew. In Aliens, Gorman dies to atone for his mistake. In Cruel Intentions, Sebastian dies to save the woman he loves. In RoboCop 3 however, Lewis dies only to get her out of the film, and to add a cheap revenge motive for RoboCop to get the bad guy. So...anyway, RoboCop takes a bazooka to the chest, McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs leave him for dead, He joins the resistance and decides to fight for their cause, the Japanese corporation dispatches a robot samurai to deal with RoboCop and the resistance, the cops all quit when they're forced to work with the rehabs, RoboCop takes out McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs, and of course, saves the day. Now let me explain what that Directive Four crap was, and why it makes no sense here. In the original film, Directive four was a fail-safe put in by OCP's corrupt vice president. Which meant that RoboCop could not apprehend, or act against any member of OCP. Here's why it makes no sense First of all you would think, that after the events of the first film, that RoboCop's designers would've taken that out, so something like that wouldn't happen again. Second, after being left for dead by the rehabs, RoboCop simply deletes the directive. If he could do that at any time, why didn't he just do that earlier, and why couldn't he do that in one of the previous films? To sum it all up, RoboCop 3 pretty much sucks all around. The climax was halfway decent, but the rest just sucked. The lead actor doesn't even come remotely close to filling Peter Weller's shoes, the humor isn't funny, Anne Lewis dies for no reason, the main villain isn't even the least bit threatening, and 90% of the time RoboCop is always getting his a$$ kicked! I don't blame Frank Miller for the movie being bad, everyone knows that the studio determines how a movie is made, and how it will turn out. In fact, If you're a fan of RoboCop, and want to see What could've been. I recommend you pick up one of Frank Miller's RoboCop graphic novels. I've read one of them myself, and it was excellent! You'll get much more entertainment from reading one of them, than you'll get out of this cinematic pile of crap! Like most poorly done sequels, RoboCop 3 could've been great, but all it turned out to be was a last-ditch effort to squeeze out more money for the studio. If you haven't seen it, skip it. If you have, do yourself a favor and pretend it never existed!

Nancy Allen was a fixture in this series, this is how you repay her? Not only that, but Robocop's revenge was so anti-climatic. I wanted to see something gritty vengeance, not the stuff we got. Flying Robcop with a jetpack? It's like the writers wanted to purposely crap all over the legacy of Robocop. The set-up is actually filled with potential, but it fails to maximize on it.

Thankfully, she didn't overdo it. Jill Hennessy is gorgeous to look at, average performance wise. They didn't explore her character enough. People like Mako, Rip Torn & Bradley Whitford are wasted in their roles. This isn't the atrocity people say it is, but it's a lifeless sequel that killed the franchise.

However, the film takes a few liberties that might be upsetting for fans (especially concerning one of the series' most beloved characters). Aside from that, the story plays out in a pretty standard fashion, and little is added to the established characters. Despite a few interesting ideas, there's little satire or thematic depth to be found.This film uses good, but rarely great, photography and editing. Acting is pretty silly and over-the-top from the whole cast; it worked great under Paul Verhoeven, but with Dekker's direction, this level of excess is not nearly as effective. Writing is average at best. This production has some okay-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. The music score brings back the classic theme of the first film, but doesn't really much variation on it.RoboCop 3 is the film where RoboCop commandeers a pimpmobile, catches a bullet with his bare hands, and where ED-209 becomes loyal as a puppy. This is pretty much on the same level as 1995's Judge Dredd; both films have the potential for some serious edge, but it is dulled pretty heavily by simply being too cheesy and lightweight. It's easily the worst of the original series, but still entertaining as a guilty pleasure.Recommended only to the most die-hard of RoboCop fans.3/5 (Entertainment Good | Story Average | Film Marginal) "},{"Title":"Makes Robocop 2 look like a masterpiece","Date":"31 January 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" Robocop 3 is hardly disregarded film and for good reason as it a very poor sequel and conclusion to the Robocop series, becoming a pale intimation of itself. Robocop 3 follows on from Robocop 2 left off, with OCP being brought out by a Japanese company and must start construction of Delta City or else go bankrupt. They need to force the eviction of a poor district and OCP are met with armed resistance and when Robocop's (Robert John Burke) partner, Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) is killed by OCP's lead thug he ends up joining rebels.Robocop 3 is a very poor film, suffering from a number of problems. There were major casting changes and whilst Burke does a decent job replacing Paul Weller, but he is surrounded by an atrocious acting, such as Remy Ryan as a genius child hacker. The action was very weak, especially compared to the first two, the violence was toned down and had horrible special effects when the first two have very strong effects for their time. It looked cheap in the first film Robocop had ED-209 as a threat, Robocop 2 had RoboCain, Robocop 3's big threat was a robot ninja and only played by a regular man.Lewis was killed off in this film, a major character in the series and she wasn't even given a proper send off, just killed so the film could showcase their bland British badguy is evil, enjoying pain, suffering and power.Robocop 2 was a film with major problems, but at least director Irvin Kershner and his writers were trying to honour and recreate Paul Verhoeven's look and style and try and keep the satirical elements of the first film. Robocop 3's director Fred Dekker disregarded the legacy, making a less serious yet less funny film. It took 20 minutes before we got to see Robocop (I think by the third film people don't need to wait to see him). They was no effort on the satirical edge or being interesting.Bradley Whitford from The West Wing was a refreshing presence in the film, being a bright spot as the Jackass extraordinaire and Julie Hennessy as Dr. Lazarus was one of the better performers.As a finale to the Robocop trilogy Robocop is a wasted opportunity, dumbing down and toning a very adult series and serves as the Batman and Robin of the Robocop series. "},{"Title":"Robocop 3","Date":"19 January 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" With the imminent release of the new Robocop film I thought a rewatch of the notorious trilogy bookend was in order. Directed by Fred 'The Monster Squad' Dekker and written by graphic novel icon Frank Miller how could it go wrong? Well in all fairness I don't think they did go that far wrong abeit a few obvious changes.First of all as we all know the overall violence had been watered down hugely. Of course there are some that will argue that blood n bullets don't equal a good film, and they'd be right, but in the case of this franchise I personally think you need it. Like various other classic adult franchises ('Alien', 'Predator', 'The Crow' etc...) they simply work better without restrictions on who will be watching them, free reign...because they are for adults. So straight off the bat all the dark satirical graphic novel type violence and blood has almost been taken out. I say almost because the film does have some good moments. You can tell its an old 90's film because it does still manage to squeeze in some violence and edgy bleakness. A small scene where an OCP suit leaps out of their tall skyscraper due to their stock crash. Next scene we see a 'blink and you'll miss it' shot of him hitting the ground, well you don't actually see that. Plus during some actions scenes where bad/good guys are gunned down you do get some good old fashioned bloody squib hits just like the first two films. Most don't have any squibs but they are in there so the film isn't all PG-13, pretty sure you get that these days.The actual plot isn't too bad in all honesty, its not too unfamiliar but it works for this franchise. OCP control the cops and now have this special unit specialising in clearing out this specific urban region in Detroit to make way for Delta City, yep the're STILL trying to make Delta City. Naturally OCP are trying to make out this is a positive thing for Detroit and they're actually helping people relocate, but of course in reality they are acting like Nazi's and stormtrooping everybody off in buses without a care for families, property, well being etc... The concept works but its a forced one, most of these OCP guys are dressed like Nazi SS officers with long trench coats in militaristic fashion. They round everyone up just like the Jews were in WWII, many end up getting shot but all that is covered up by news propaganda. Their leader played by Brit John Castle is a decent Euro villain who snarls perfectly. So you throw Robo into the mix and at first, like the cops, he's following OCP rules but eventually he sees how wrong it is, as do the cops, and they all change sides. Its all very predictable, there are a few predictable sequences where the drama is suppose to be heightened to rouse your emotions, like when the cops turn up to help the civvies or when Robo goes after the bad guy who kills Lewis, but the film never really manages to charge you up as it should. It tries hard to do so but just feels flat. There are some nice visual moments (Robo's intro sequence) but nothing as iconic as the first film, hell even 'Robocop 2' couldn't quite give us anything that visually iconic.I think the worst part of the film was the inclusion of the Japanese company working with OCP. This really didn't need to be in there and I don't think you would of missed it if it wasn't. The most heinous crime for the film had to be the Japanese samurai assassin cyborg which was like something out of a trashy low budget ripoff flick. The daft part being this cyborg looked infinitely more advanced and sophisticated than Robo, more like a Terminator, and could have easily kicked his ass all over. Well he could of if he didn't just do martial arts flying kicks on him. He does manage to slice Robo's forearm off but somehow Robo is able to just stick that gun enhancement back on, despite his arm being half sliced off by a katana.The killing of Officer Lewis definitely meant the end of the road for this franchise though. I was still quite impressed they got quite a few cast members back for classic characters, OCP suit Johnson, Casey Wong, Bixby Snyder and Sgt. Reed are all back, as is a nice well done cameo from ED 209 (unaltered too). I was also impressed with the makeup on Robo's face when his visor is off. They managed to get Burke looking exactly like Weller! no dilution anywhere, the effects are spot on and look great as does the rest of the suit. I also think Burke did a good job as Robo, he accentuates his walking and mouth movements a bit too much if you ask me but apart from that he was good. All sound effects on Robo's movement, his gun, ED 209 and visual graphics for Robo's vision are all perfectly recreated, good continuity.Yeah so jet pack Robo felt a bit too much like a merchandising ploy but...damn I'll admit it I quite liked the idea. Its not too incredible an idea and it did look quite cool. I think the limitations on budget and effects hampered what could of been something pretty neat. All in all this film isn't as bad as I recall to be honest, it carries on nicely from the previous films, story is OK, effects all look as good as previous films...had Weller been involved who knows. Bottom line for me is the lack of graphic violence, grimy seediness and dark satire, a must in a Robocop film.5.5/10 "},{"Title":"Redefines the definition of a truly awful movie","Date":"27 November 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" Robocop I was truly amazing - I enjoy watching it - even to this day.

Even the Media Breaks are used for cheap laughs; well, everything is cheap. Returning characters are shadows of their former selves, while new RoboCop Robert John Burke waddles around in Peter Weller's cast-offs like he's shat his pants. Come the end he's a poorly-bluescreened jetpack pilot in a sequence that not only reduces the character to a cartoonish parody but also transforms him into an action figure. Dekker's direction is apathetic, the villains are cartoons, the action is flat,the visual effects are dire and there isn't a single moment that doesn't fail in some way.

In an attempt to bridge a wider audience, the signature violence and gritty nature of the previous RoboCop films is diluted down, however it's hard to imagine anyone post Terminator 2 feeling the faintest of thrills from what is a clumsy looking, badly written exercise in endurance against tedium. Surprisingly, a few supporting players from previous 'Robo's' clock back in for another shift, although one presumes it's purely for the money and their presence does little much other than to remind of just how far the apple has fallen from the tree. To it's minor credit, RoboCop 3 tries hard not to take itself too seriously and while there's a few gags that raise a smile, these moments are thinly spread and mostly serve as distant echo's of Paul Verhoeven's vastly superior original. As the end draws near and your brain has had enough, Robo turns 'Superman' as we witness him donning a jet-pack while dishing out justice to the bad guys from the skies. What should be the jaw dropping final spectacle looks sadly outdated and is emblematic of how passe the series has become.

But they f*cked that up too &#x96; more on that later.Detroit must've gotten tired of being the scungy future city, in this film most of the action takes place in the fictional Delta City. This time OCP, the company that runs the police force has been taken over by a Japanese company, meaning everything is more efficient and profitable &#x96; even the Robo-Ninja.I won't spend much time on this one because this is where a mediocre franchise really hit the downslope and got desperate. Roby 3 has a genius tech savvy 6 year old working alongside the resistance and performing elaborate hacking and programmes with her rudimentary laptop that is bigger than her. It also introduces Lewis with such drama and seriousness that you would think it was a De Niro reveal. Nope, just the same untalented actress still hanging around dining off the same one shift association with an automated cop.A typically seedy and punkish looking gang serves as the resident minions, and it is 20 minutes before we even see Roby this time out. Peter Weller has gone, but that was never a big factor anyway, consider this just another set of lips spouting the same banal dialogue and cheesy catchphrases.Everyone is still surprised again when he thinks for himself, again he is gunned down and left for dead, and again once he realises just who is behind everything he comes up against a purpose built Robo-Cop-Killer, the altogether too built up Robo-Ninja.Look I hoped like hell that the battle of the Robos would rock, which made the awkward pacing and two or three moves before a crappy killing stroke battle that followed so disappointing, I can't stress enough how dodgy the two confrontations between the Robo's are.In fact the 'massive' finale is full of tacky sub-Troma-esque touches. In a street battle with hundreds of enemies face to face on both sides and thousands of rounds fired no-one dies until Robo-Cop shows up, and after he wins the day in 15 seconds flat everyone jumps around like drunk idiots after the superbowl.Final Rating &#x96; 4.5 / 10.

The movie takes the economic troubles of the times, especially the widening gap between the rich and poor, and takes them to the extreme. This is symbolized between the battle between the working class with the help of the police department and the ruling elite with help from the splatter punks. The film has many parallels with the social landscape of the late 80's and early 90's. Similarly to how OCP's plan to run Detriot's police force under a government contract spun out of control, Reagan's plan to turn Cold War difficulties over to NSC operatives to fund the contra army also ended in disaster with the decision to use a private, for-profit company to divert money.

Look at the fiery sexy (Nancy Allen) also, as she agreed to reprise her role if her character was to be killed off in the first half of the movie ! I liked the ninja fighter, the flying Robocop as a dream comes true, and the idea of computer genius child which is adorable and scarcely done.

Not to mention the fervent music and its sense of sublimity; especially at the climactic flying scene where the feeling of victory was unforgettably impassioned. The things to complain about are  few moments of bad special effects (very obvious at the flying), the Japanese businessmen as the evil force who's going to buy the country !

Even the swearing was toned down gregariously as well. My guess was that the producers were trying to promote this film to a more broader audience. They went far as to have an animated version of Robocop as a way of making merchandise and if that's not enough to hurt a franchise, remember a few years ago Robocop invaded WCW wrestling and came to the aid of Sting (Steve Borden), that was pure ludicrous (Who remembers Capitol Combat 90 The Return of Robocop) This is the worst thing since Rick Steiner having a verbal spat with Chucky from Child's Play.Another factor that hurt the series was its frugal budget.

'Robocop 3' is made solely for children because Orion thought they could sell toys. It's a kind of offensively ironic thought really because 'Robocop' is a movie that blatantly is about commercialism stealing the soul. I think as it's own piece 'Robocop 3' is merely a forgettable action film but as a sequel it is a slap in the face to the mythology and the fans. 'Robocop 3' feels as though you can feel Orion breath down the neck of the film. It is a children's film and it's a children's film in the worst possible way. It plays as if it thinks kids are stupid. This is a quintessential flaw, children are intelligent especially with adventure films. Why are films like 'Star Wars' or 'Superman' so brilliant at capturing the imagination of children and adults alike? Because they take time to develop a mythology and characters that are engrossing and spark the imagination. 'Robocop 3' is a sequel to two very adult films that have a mythology that deals with very adult themes that are beyond children's capacities. Gone completely in 'Robocop 3' is the violent anti-capitalist satire but even more important is the themes of losing one's humanity. Alex Murphy does not want to be Robocop. Robocop is a perversion of the laws of life and death and the first film is an exploration of what it is to be human. Sure Robocop looks cool but the aesthetics hide a troubled soul seeking to reclaim it's self. 'Robocop 3' is all about celebrating the cool looking aesthetics because they sell toys and not caring about what lie underneath. There is some aspects of the Alex Murphy resurrection story trying to fight their way to the surface here but they are ruined by the fact that this film can't play with them because they might scare children and so instead we get rock'em sock 'em jetpacks. 'Robocop 3' probably shouldn't have been made. There really wasn't anything left to tell in the story. That being said I think Dekker and crew had the foundations upon which to build something had they not been told to make a children's films. I like the idea of an armed resistance finally fighting OCP because it is very much a natural endpoint to what Verhoven set up in the original. The problem is that in order to do this story right you have to go into some radical leftist territory that doesn't sell tickets or toys. Fred Dekker takes a great deal of criticism for the film's failure and I don't think that is particularly fair. If anything this film is above a bomb rating because Dekker can effectively stage really brilliant action sequences. I think 'Robocop 3' could have been a lot of fun had they given Dekker complete creative control. 'Night of the Creeps' is a very funny and visually fun gory horror film and a 'Robocop 3' made in those lines would have been an effective fun end to the trilogy. I like the action scenes provided that some of the stupid dialogue is taken away.The film is just a mess and a missed opportunity. I like to think that somehow this film could have been good and Fred Dekker would get the respect he deserves and that this great series would have had a proper ending. The problem is you can see a film company perverting something profound in order to make money. Orion was kind of like OCP in that regard...

Watching this was like watching a cheap episode of a Robocop TV show than a actual movie. The plot is just terrible, I don't know if it's because it tries to be kid friendly but it just doesn't work. The special effects look really cheap in this and seems like the most low budget out of the 3 movies in this franchise. In fact this one is just not worthy to be in this franchise, this movie really does ruin this franchise from being a good trilogy. In fact it does a lot of damage to this franchise, for being the 3rd installment everything is super lame and stupid. There just doesn't seem like any effort has been made for this one, maybe the creators just thought it's Robocop so there doesn't need to be much effort made as long as they make their money.

Also another thing is that Robocop is hardly in any of the action sequences and when he is, he comes off as tragically wimpy. I mean Robocop beat ED 209 and Robocop 2 two worthy challenges and his adversary this time are ninja androids and an army? Also the grenade he takes to the chest is extremely ridiculous because he had to have been blasted twice by the machine in the second one by rockets and so this Robocop is positively not the killing machine he was in the first two. Also the tone of the film has changed into a more kid friendly action flick and because the first two felt like graphic novels this disappoints anyone over the age of 9.

The original Robocop was a fresh, hip, exciting flick when it came out, and this is not. However, this film has aspirations of its own, and it lives up to them. I think it took a lot of guts to change the direction of the series like they did here, moving away from the dark nihilism of part 2 and giving us a strong moralistic story and turning Robo into a humanitarian superhero, a champion of the oppressed and helpless. It's almost like the turn Miller made when he did Mad Max 3. That film was no Road Warrior, but it was still good.There are a lot of bad things about this movie the Japanese android was good but terribly misused, there are no action sequences that stand out, and some of the lines were incredibly cheesy. However, I think the acting was the best of the entire franchise save for the first, and I think they took great care to develop the movie's secondary characters, something they completely disregarded in part 2. I also liked that they used Poledouris' original score, which was sorely missing from part 2.I would put this on par with Prime Directives, above Part 2, and far above the TV series. If you're looking for a film that compares to the first, forget it. That movie is in a league of its own. Its greatness is the reason so many mediocre entries were even made.

I can see why a lot of people wouldn't like this film, but there are some cool things to be seen in this film.  ...And it was much better than I expected.  This could have been an excellent film if a few things had been changed.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!The first thing that didn't sit very well with me was that they killed off Officer Lewis.  Granted, it was a noble death and was pretty well done, but I didn't want to see Lewis get gunned down so haphazardly.Secondly, there needed to be some better (and longer) fights between RoboCop and Otomo (The Japanese Android)!  All of the fights between the two were way too short and were anti-climatic.  Although, I must say I liked Otomo during the fight scenes, he had some good moves.  It just seemed to me that RoboCop was a bit of a wimp against Otomo.  And, in the finale of the film, our hero doesn't even get the kill, the little computer hacker girl turns the Otomos against each other.  Quite a bit far-fetched if you ask me.Lastly, there were a number of cheesy things throughout the film that could have easily been avoided or better done.  For instance, the scene where the little computer hacker girl hacks into ED-209 and makes him obey her.  Kind of a cool idea, but could have easily been done better.  Oh, and why did they always refer to the CEO as The CEO, just give the guy a name!!!  Also, some of the comedy in the film was either too dark or misplaced.  I would tend to want to leave the comedy out of a film like this.END OF SPOILERSThe cast in the film was decent, I wouldn't say excellent, but they got the job done.  I thought Robert John Burke was a good replacement for Peter Weller, Peter will definitely always be the true Robocop/Murphy in my eyes, but Burke pulled it off and looks quite a bit like Weller at times.  Nancy Allen returns to the role of Anne Lewis and does a fine job, as was expected.  Remy Ryan (as Nikko) was ok, sometimes really good, sometimes terrible, nothing spectacular there.  Rip Torn (as the CEO) was a bit unexpected in the film, but did an ok job.  I don't blame Rip, I blame the writer of the character, there was just something off about him.  Mako (as Kanemitsu) did a fine job as usual, he played the perfect head-honcho Japanese business man.  Something about CCH Pounder (as Bertha) really bugs me, I'm not really sure what it is, but there was something I didn't like about the character...or maybe it's the actor...I'm not sure.  Stephen Root was another unexpected cast member, although at the time of this film he was somewhat unknown, now it's hard to see him as anyone other than Jimmy James of News Radio.  Nonetheless, he did a fine job with is role in this film.  Daniel von Bargen (as Moreno) did a great job with his role as well, there is something about this actor that I've always liked.  Jill Hennessy (as Dr. Marie Lazarus) was a nice touch, she did a fine job in the film and looked quite good.  Bradley Whitford did a pretty good job, a few bad lines here and there, but overall, pretty good.  He seems to be very good at playing a smug jerk.  All in all, the cast was pretty good, a few things I would have changed here and there, but the fault in this film lies more with the writing and the direction, not the cast.The plot in the film was nothing to write home about, but it was decent, it had it's moments.  I did think it was interesting that RoboCop was forced to choose between defending the public and serving his creators (OCP).  The film had an interesting idea, what happens when two of RoboCop's prime directives contradict each other?  Good idea, not perfectly executed, but a good idea.I was somewhat impressed with the special effects in this film, sure they weren't perfect, but there is some good stuff to see.  The scenes involving RoboCop and Otomo looked pretty nice.  Personally, I thought the flying RoboCop was pretty well done as well (could be that my expectations were quite low)...granted, they could have been better, but I'm sure the budget was somewhat low for the film.  There were also a number of really great stunts in the film.No, the film isn't spectacular, and it isn't as good as either of it's predecessors, but it's worth a watch.  If you are a fan of the previous RoboCop films, give this one a shot, just don't get your expectations too high.

The dark comedy in this comes off as extremely misplaced. They continue the tradition, started by the prior entry, of making fun of what we earlier took seriously. Honestly, there should be severe penalties for the puppy line. The attempts at recreating or mimicking elements of the first get increasingly desperate, and the satire is worse than nonexistent, it's plain *ugly*. Some of what Frank Miller wrote for the sequel before this one that wasn't used in that, made its way into this, utterly devoid of the fun and imagination of how he thought it up, of course(do read that comic book instead of viewing either of these, if you're a fan of his). Evidently, between the previous picture and this, Johnson turned into... well, his name. In fact, all the old characters seem messed up, several are parodies of their old selves, and the new ones aren't that interesting. Credibility is an issue, too. It can be debated how adequate a choice Burke was... he certainly doesn't bring a lot of emotion to the part... but CCH Pounder, Rip Torn and Mako do impressive work. How do you manage to render their efforts forgettable? I suppose this script was what it took. And Stephen Root... for crying out loud, they wasted *Milton*! The flight gear and Otomo... let's just say, I'm with Rod Hilton in regards to those. A cute, spunky kid hacker(and of course, computers can do whatever is convenient for them to do) is one of the leads. Who thought this would be worthwhile? Who in their right, or even wrong or twisted mind, would take a look at the description of those ingredients, and sincerely feel that it would come to be anything other than Pure Crap Stew? The pacing is lackluster. The acting is underdone or overplayed. This has not got a single memorable scene to it, and you'd be hard pressed to find any redeeming qualities. The action is dull and uninspired(I would like to point out that more than one of the sequences consist of one fighter *nudging* their enemy every so often). Whatever thematic material or message there is in this is a poorly stated, micro-wave re-heated puddle of whatever was left of one of the points the original movie made expertly, that the second also tried for. In the end, this one isn't even good for a laugh, or to see how low they sank. There is quite frankly nothing here.

The fault of this does not belong at the feet of film-maker FRED DEKKER & the production crew, but rather the then financially burdened Orion Pictures executives who demanded that the film be watered down to a PG-13 rating in the hopes of gathering a much more wider audience than the first two films & thus opening the door for bigger & better financial returns, this ultimately proved to be a big backfire for Orion, because not only was ROBOCOP 3 critically panned by both fans & critics (it's listed in the top 30 worst sequels of all times list according to Empire magazine) but it drove away it's target audience that flocked to the theatres in droves to see the first two & teenage & pre-teen audiences didn't bother to go see it either, with the few who did see it calling it trifling & boring, causing the film to be a financial flop & in an ironic twist, Orion executives wound up helping to killing off their own money making franchise! Another big drawback is the fact that almost none of the same people who made the first two (sans FRANK MILLER who helped pen the second film & a few of the actors) return here. Dan O' Herlihy has moved on as the chairman of OCP, even Peter Weller is missing in action, replaced by ROBERT JOHN BURKE, who actually fills the role of Robocop quiet nicely & was a close enough match to make for a possible replacement for Weller & puts in a very fine performance as the films hero. The gore & heavy violence has been heavily toned down as most of the action usually consists of lighter fighting scenes, explosions & shooting, not to mention a few car chases. However these scenes are few & far between & mostly occur in the first half hour & last twenty minutes of the film, in between the action set pieces, the film is utterly dry on action & Robocop spends the vast majority of the middle of the movie completely damaged & out of action.I will say this though, despite it's many drawbacks, ROBOCOP 3 at the very least keeps it's story fairly simple, without adding to many subplots that go underdeveloped, which is one of the things I felt hampered ROBOCOP 2. Dekker does fairly well behind the camera & he also peppers his script with some fairly funny moments The little girl heroine of the piece actually has a Robocop & ED 209 action figure, he brings back the I'll buy that for a dollar commercial from the first, as well as returning to the original Robocop metallic coloured armour (Part 2 had a blue armour look) & plenty of humour, especially in a scene where a guy walks into a small diner to rob it, only to find out that a lot of the patrons are well armed cops & a humorous commercial advertising the Johnny Rehab doll, based on a popular cartoon series for kids.In the end, ROBOCOP 3 while nowhere near as good as the first two films, is worth a watch. As a sequel, it's not very good, but if looked at as a stand alone entry, or even a full length version of the 1994 TV series, it remains a fairly watchable film. But this is strictly for fans of the first two films, if you're not one of those people than I wouldn't bother with this one.

He's even shorter than original Robo Peter Weller. Or at least Weller was little thinner. Or less bulkier. Or better actor. Speaking of actors, Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) is one of the few original actors who did actually return into this third installment of the series, and even she had the wisdom to die in this. Good for her.And then there is this feeling in the film, that someone had a bright idea of making a kid friendly RoboCop film without brutal action.And if that isn't enough there are these pretty poorly executed special effects, like the flying jet pack RoboCop.As for sequels go, this isn't probably as bad as Conan the Destroyer, but it's pretty close.

The directing is entirely sub-par compared to Verhoeven's masterpiece, the writing is embarrassing, and the acting is uneven. If I had to pick a particular thing that made the movie crap, though, I would say it was the horrible writing. For example if being a police officer is the point of Robocop's existence, why is he going to go up against the people that own the police department he works for? How many computers do you know of that just delete their commands at a whim, because they don't want to follow a command when they feel compassionate towards people that are being ushered out of their homes? The plot is ridiculous.As for directing, I didn't really have too terribly many complaints. At least you could understand what was going on. I remember the first time I watched Battlefield Earth, and I couldn't even figure out what the characters on the screen were doing, because the directing was so bad. I was really expecting a little bit more violence from a Robocop film. Although, if an extraordinary plot had been there, the lack of violence wouldn't have bothered me so much.As for the acting, however, I don't even know what to tell you. Nancy Allen wasn't so bad, but she was underused, and died too quickly. Not to mention that the way she died was rather undeserving, especially considering the integral part she played in the first two films. As for the other actors, it was real bad, starting from Peter Weller's replacement, Robert John Burke, all the way down to the horribly miscast Rip Torn. I'm not really sure what Rip Torn was hoping to accomplish by being in this rotten film, but I hope he got it out of his system, so he can go back to being in movies that don't rank so high on the crap-o-meter.Anyway, It's the crappiest of all 3 Robocop films, which you could've probably figured it was going to be when you heard that Peter Weller wasn't even going to reprise the role that made him famous.

Having finally watched this train wreck for the first time, I don't blame him. It's almost hard to believe how many bad ideas and clichés are woven into this turd. Beyond all of that is the more troubling realization that, as far as protagonists go, RoboCop is a dead end with no room to grow. Although he is capable of making decisions based on emotions, he is basically a zombie with no personality &#x96; not exactly someone you want to spend a whole lot of time with.OCP (the fascist corporation that has been trying to take over Detroit) still hasn't gotten anywhere. You'd think by the third film OCP would be in the midst of building their dystopian Delta City. It certainly would have made for a more interesting setting than boring old downtown Detroit. They've formed a Nazi-like regime (led by a snooty Englishman) to forcibly evict people.We're soon introduced to Nico, one of the film's more annoying characters. Of course, she's a kid genius who can hack into robots and computers using her laptop computer. After being separated from her parents, she befriends a group of libertarian revolutionaries that are trying to resist OCP by hiding in the sewers. When RoboCop sees the plight of the people he decides to join their cause. The audience, on the other hand, will find it hard to identify with the rebels. Why are they willing to give up their lives for such deplorable living conditions? In a lame reference to Detroit's failing auto industry, OCP has been taken over by a Japanese rival. To make matters even more stupid, the Japanese company sends over a Terminator-like ninja robot to fight RoboCop, even though RoboCop and the police force are owned and operated by OCP. Don't get excited; the inevitable duel between RoboCop and the ninja is (and I say this without hyperbole) one of the worst fight scenes ever put on film.The story is also painfully predictable. In one scene, a nameless officer approaches Murphy's old partner and asks, Hey, want this body armor? which she declines because she's off-duty. You guessed it, she gets shot and killed in the next scene. When the rebels steal a futuristic jetpack from the police armory, you know that somewhere down the line RoboCop's going to be flying around like a jackass, which he does in the grand finale. The visual effects are even more embarrassing when you consider that Jurassic Park was in theaters that same year.The RoboCop series started out OK, but it quickly degenerated into a creatively-bankrupt mess once director Paul Verhoeven left and Frank Miller started writing them. While RoboCop 2 was pretty awful, the third film is almost unwatchable. The characters are annoying, the action is boring, the special effects are terrible, and the plot makes no sense. It's a prime example of how not to make a sequel, and I implore you not to waste your time watching it. I decided to review it and it was on Netflix instant stream, so that's my excuse.

(I'll touch upon that later). -Characters, at least for me, weren't so likable and you definitely didn't care about Robo as much as you did in the last 2 films.-3 does try and somewhat succeed in being like Robocop with the news reports and the opening scene that doesn't pertain to the plot. -The quips Weller delivered that Burke does fairly well. -Although PG-13, still a fairly gritty movie. -Brings back some of the humor and wit that was noticeably absent in Robo 2. -Has DECENT CGI, but if you want to argue about bad CGI, take a look at the scene in Robo 1 when Dick falls from the OCP building.So, when people complain about the unrealistic plot about OCP breaking down people's apartments and sending people to camps, its a lot like Sin City (another Miller movie).

It lacks pretty much everything that made the first two films good (and yes, I considered RoboCop 2 to be a good movie).Firstly, the new guy just isn't RoboCop. Sure, he does the movement part quite well, but the face, the voice... it just isn't the same. This shouldn't reflect badly on his ability though, but it's just the way it is.Second, I could spot many, many parts where to movie tried to be funny. Where the original and the first sequel managed to mix humor into the mix, this installment just fails to be funny no matter how much it tries. It ends up being simply embarrassing.Then there's the whole deal with Lewis. I'm surprised Allen took any part in this. Her character is effectively thrown aside in the middle of the movie like a used... erm, well, you get the point. Since she apparently insisted her character has to die early, I guess she wasn't too happy about the whole project either ;)The new head of OCP is also just plain bad. He also attempts to be funny I guess, but he's just pathetic and annoying.The theme of the story has potential to be decent, but it is just simply very poorly executed. Overall the characters are boring (and RoboCop much weaker than in the previous movies), which doesn't help the story at all.Oh, and don't even get me started on Otomo. Good grief. Not only does he change his facial appearance to something completely retarded every times his face is damaged, but he's in general a pathetic thing in every way. On first seeing him you expect him to be a badass, but boy, how wrong that assessment is.Long story short this movie is just one long anti-climax that never should have seen the light of day.

It's more ignored by some people than it deserves, and if you've never seen it, then it's probably a lot better than you think it is.That theory counts double if you've seen Robocop 2 - which was about what you'd expect for a spin-off sequel, really, a movie that had some of the first's sense of humour but lacked its edgy quality and had a lower quality of supporting cast. But if your introduction to Robocop was this nightmare of a movie, then it goes about a thousand times more.Robocop isn't Robocop anymore in this movie. Oh, he looks like him, but all his attitude is gone, sacrificed to the god of TV and PG-13 political correctness. And that means that with it has gone the ruthlessness of the world he was within. In Robocop, cops are killed frequently, crime is rampant and the world is falling apart - a ruthless, tireless policeman who can shoot with computer-aided accuracy to kill is a solution to the problems of the world, and he meets a brutal world with the brutality needed to break it. But if you dropped the Robocop from THIS movie into the world of the first one, the cop killers would only have died laughing.Do yourself a favour, give this movie a miss and watch the original.

Most disappointingly of all, Robocop 3's PG-13 rating also fails to deliver heart-pounding extravagant action that was always present in the first two films.The movie moves slow - it doesn't bother to excite the viewer by providing fast paced story telling or explosive action. Severely lacking in this department, you shouldn't expect any exciting firefights or boss battles. In fact, the Kanemitsu cyborg which is sent to destroy Murphy in what we expect to be an exciting and action-packed finale ends with no cathartic explosive climax, but rather a whimpering premature ejaculation of listless fighting scenes. Murphy spends half the movie disabled from a fusillade of gunshots that have never left a scratch on him in the past. No fake commercials or newscasts that touch upon our cultures corrosive mentality makes you nostalgically pine for what you remembered to be a whacky, funny and ridiculously over-the-top movie franchise.The terrible story, the boring unfolding of the events, the lack of action and violence, and the missing element of subtle humor and comedy makes Robocop 3 an epic failure in all departments.

I grew up with all three films as a kid where only I'd admire the first two because they had Peter Weller playing the cyborg hero where I was used to him and not anybody else donning the outfit.It's not a good film, but some parts aren't bad at all.The film itself is like the first sequel where the city of Detroit is nothing but a big pile of crap with crime on the horizon, but this time around the cops are back on their feet. In the sequel, developers want to kick the people out of the city to make a better Detroit (gee, wasn't this like Robocop 2?) while at the same time killing a bunch of freedom fighters stopping them from the idea. Yet, it's up to Robocop (Robert John Burke) to do what he can with innovated weapons to save the city.The Good Only certain action sequences make you want to see the film before changing the station. Trust me, there aren't any good performances nor is there a villain to cheer for. Plus the background music is worth hearing.The OK It was nice to see Nancy Allen as Anne Lewis, Robert De'Qui as Sgt. Reed, Mario Machado as the male reporter from the two previous films and Felton Perry as the kiss ass Johnson while seeing a surprise list of celebrity guests from Rip Torn, CCH Pounder, Eve La Rue, Mako, Daniel Von Bargan, Bradley Whitford, Stephen Root, Jeff Garlin and others. I also like the freedom fighter characters. Robert John Burke wasn't that bad as the robot; it was a good thing he was in the suit the entire time without having to see his face, but I was embarrassed by the lines they fed him unlike Peter Weller.The Bad Where do I begin? First of all, why did the film had to be PG-13 compared to the R-Rated films? Just because Robocop was liked by both kids and adults, doesn't mean you have to tone down the violence since it was the heart and soul of the franchise with all media, including kids shows making reference to it. I hated the little kid as well since the producers wanted to make it more family friendly where her character saved more people than any one else. The villain McDagget was a worthless P.O.S. compared to Cain and Boddicker where their crew would've wiped him out. The Japanese robots were funny and hideous while not being scary.Overall Review Music is good, love seeing the cameo appearances, some action sequences were good, but it's not good enough.

Such weapon enhancements include a repeating submachine gun, a smart bomb and flamethrower. Though impressive at first it fails to make an entirely good impression as they aren't used very often. For instance when Robocop raided the OCP office at the Detroit Police Station he used his flamethrower against the map and various other bits but doesn't actually kill any of the Rehab soldiers.Which brings me to another point, the violence in this film has severely been toned down compared to previous movies. Even Robocop Prime Directives has more violence than this. To a certain degree there is a theme of darkness in Robocop 3. OCP wants to finish Delta City but the residents refuse to move out so instead they are forced out through heavier and tactical means. As others have mentioned before Robocop has become extremely weak. I thought Robocop was impervious to bombs and bullets? When he suffers a direct impact from a M203 grenade his system efficiency drops substantially, around 53%. The typical theme of avenging a downed officer (Lewis) almost works well, until the end.The animation used when Robocop flies around is extremely... crude. I suspect that getting Robocop to fly would've cost less than him being on foot to actually help the Detroit Police against the Rehab army. Such a battle would've been far more impressive. Come to think of it, I don't recall Robocop actually killing any Rehab soldiers at all except until the end. Compared to Robocop where the kill count was extremely high with blood everywhere... well... you know.On a more positive note, the excellent soundtrack from the first Robocop movie is back. It's used quite well. 6/10 because of the soundtrack and a good attempt at extending the plot line. Some flaws do prevent it from scoring more, such as some of the things he do. E.g. him shooting the top of his Police Car in a circle in order to break through it and say Police officer, no loitering. That's just cheesy. The same silly shooting tactic appears when he breaks down a door by shooting a rough outline for him to break through. What a waste of ammo... then again it seems as if his Type-9 handgun has unlimited ammo.

It seemed somewhat geared towards children, the plot was tired and recycled, the violence still packed a punch but lacked the seriousness and dramatic flair of the first film. In a sense, all humanity shining through the RoboCop character from the first film was gone.RoboCop 3 (1993) has none of the above. It has no heart, it has no brains, it has no sly social puns, and it has no hard violence. It's goofy and stupid. Over-the-top and obnoxious. Some qualities are redeemable. Most are not. It's undoubtedly the worst of the series.Filmed in 1991 and delayed for two years due to film company Orion's pending bankruptcy, RoboCop 3 centers around Murphy, a.k.a. RoboCop (Robert John Burke), joining forces with evicted squatters who are opposing Omni Consumer Products, the new conglomerate company running Detroit, which is kindly referred to by the homeless citizens as Opposing Capitalist Pigs. (Oh, how clever!) OCP is no longer run by The Old Man (Daniel O'Herlihy), but rather The CEO (Rip Torn), a character played over-the-top for laughs that never come; he is an annoying miscalculation and, in fact, almost a characterized representation of the flaws of the entire movie. He is in cahoots with the Japanese to throw citizens of futuristic Detroit out of their homes and onto the street so that he can level their homes and build big money-making skyscrapers.RoboCop doesn't like this one bit, and after seeing a lone child named Nikko (Remy Ryan) run across a street and into the arms of squatters, he decides it's time to protect the innocent and delete his fourth directive, which instructs him to not oppose a member of OCP. After Lewis (Nancy Allen) is killed my a corrupt OCP employee, he swears to take vengeance and uphold the law.What a digression the RoboCop series made! It started as a biting social satire and a hard action film with heart; watching RoboCop 3 is like trying to focus on a Saturday morning cartoon serial with an invincible hero defeating uncountable foes amidst a very, very unfocused backdrop. It's hard to do. Co-characters extended in this film were made clearer in the first installment when they were given less time on screen. Johnson (Felton Perry), the black man who gave Robo the thumbs up at the end of the first film, is now partly a bad guy. He was supposed to be a fairly good guy in the first two. What's happened to him in between the first and third film that would cause him to cross over to the dark side? His evolution is as understandable as O'Herlihy's change from being a good guy in RoboCop to the villain in RoboCop 2.Peter Weller, who said making the first two films in this trilogy was the worst experience of his acting career (the suit was heavy and hot, shedding some number of pounds off his body on a daily basis), has left the series for more attractive projects, leaving John Robert Burke to fill in his shoes. Burke is okay in the suit, but his voice sounds too robotic when he speaks, lacking the monotone calmness that Weller possessed without any type of digital alteration. Burke just sounds like a robot, leaving all sense of humanity at the door. And with the mask off, his facial features look splattered with too much makeup and plastic, probably an ill-fated effort to cover up Weller's disappearance. It's not a biggie, as RoboCop himself is barely in this film at all.Yes, that's right, RoboCop is not really the subject of this movie at all. Perhaps because Weller left they decided to keep RoboCop off frame for as long as possible. He is introduced some fifteen minutes into the film during a heated (and ridiculous) car chase, he gets injured and disappears throughout most the film, comes back for a bit, then saves the day. It's like when they tried to cover up Crispin Glover's absence in Back to the Future Part II--only Zemeckis knew how to do it right. Fred Zekker, the director of RoboCop 3, does not.Paul Verhoeven was a great director at one point in time. He got away with over-the-top action because he had a way of making it brutal, gleeful and downright excellent, while managing to insert levels of humanity (remember Quaid's background in Total Recall? The flashback sequences in RoboCop?). Zekker's over-the-top style is different. It's obvious that he knows how to blow stuff up in between long passages of cheesy dialogue, but not much else.

First the company that distributed these films Orion Pictures is now bankrupt and defunct. That doesn't help matters any. Secondly this is a bad film. No let me rephrase that. Robocop 3 is a really bad film. Too much change has killed Robocop.Peter Weller as Murphy/Robocop has now departed and Robert John Burke has taken his place. They've tried their best to make him look the same - I'm talking specifically about those scenes with Robo's face plate removed and might I add what a good makeup job they did - but it's still not Weller. I think they choose Burke because of his lips. They look good and that's about the only thing you see with the whole getup on.Since we're on the topic of departures, where's the Old Man? You know the guy who ran OCP. We're given this little morsel, You remember what they did to the old man? by his replacement Rip Torn who deserves better. As for Robocop himself, well, he's been upgraded. I can only assume because these upgrades were needed to mask the seriously weak story and perhaps to sell a new line of action figures. Was Robocop with only his pistol no good anymore? Did he really need a machine gun hand or a high flying jet pack? Come on. What else is there to say? We went from a R-rated franchise with dark humor and violence to downright boring PG-13 formula.The third time out finds Robocop trying to defend the poor, sick and beaten masses who are being driven out of the way by OCP forces who naturally want their land. Wait until you see the robot ninja nemesis too. Desperate or what? I guess it gets harder and harder to find adequate story lines for a metal law enforcement butt kicking machine and that's the breaks. Because for all intense purposes Robocop is done, finito. We got this hack job they called a sequel and then there was a Robocop television show. No doubt it died a quick death and the last I seen of Robocop he was appearing in commercials for office equipment. How the mighty have fallen.

ED-209 and Robocop looked and sounded cool, eye (and ear) candy.  But this did not assure success. Murphy the man, finding his humanity even after being sentenced to the iron suit, made the audience care about him, and gave Robocop a loyal fan base.  That was what made Robocop more than your average sci-fi shoot-em up. Robocop 2 was received with less enthusiasm, but most Robocop fans and the general movie going public liked it.  It was violent and dark, like the first, and the effects while somewhat dated today were unbelievable then. Then came Robocop 3.  First Orion rushed the film into production before Robocop 2 was out of the theaters, then was forced to delay the release by two years after being bought out by MGM. When it was released in 1993, Robocop 3 was a spectacular disappointment. The dark violence from the first two films was dropped in favor of a more kid friendly version, infuriating fans.  But worse, Robocop was no longer Robocop, police officer, he was Robocop Super Hero. The idea of giving Robocop a gun arm is an obvious toy marketing ploy, as was the ridiculous jet pack.  The goal of these things was to make Robocop a super hero, but when you do that you lose Murphy the man, the most important element to the movie.  Trying to make Robocop into a whole new character but make up for it by having him sympathize with a little annoying kid, have overdone memories, experience sexual attraction (?!?), and make him highly talkative (Robocop is the strong silent type, but in Robocop 3 he says things like `I am fine, thank you.' and, `I don't have many... friends.') was the final straw.  Robocop fans were stabbed in the back, and Orion forced a real piece of kiddy friendly trash on us. Robocop also started destroying OCP police equipment, for no reason.  He destroyed the police car, something Robocop from the first two movies would never do. His partner (Nancy Allen) hardly gives her best performance, and at what should have been her best, most moving scene, was just overdone and stupid. The show made all the same mistakes, and I hope the new Robocop Prime Directives will make up for this.

These people want to tell you to ease up on RoboCop 3, obviously compensating for the fact that they are simply too insipid to get the tone of the unequaled original. I was but a nine year old boy when I saw the first RoboCop, which has taught me valuable lessons about the difference between what people say and what they mean, along with the consequences of violence. Granted, I enjoy RoboCop even more as a young adult because I understand more what Neumeier and Verhoeven were saying about Christian America, but the point is not that RoboCop was aimed specifically at adults, but rather that it was aimed at people with a brain in their head.By comparison, RoboCop 3 has obviously been aimed at special education classes. Is there some kind of requirement for commercially viable screenwriters that they confuse the word underage with retarded? There must be, given the commercial success of garbage like Barney et al! I would not have been surprised to have seen a scene from this mess in which RoboCop tells a behind-the-camera ally that they are not good if they don't have good feelings.I won't even go into how the ultra-violent, ultra-sarcastic feel of the original has died in favour of a He-Man like marketing style. Some people claim that the problem with RoboCop 3 is that the story is underwritten. That is a significant part of the problem, but compared to others, it is minor. The real problem with this film is that the dialogue and special effects are utterly dreadful. Anne Lewis' final words to Murphy were so pathetic that I honestly wanted to take a hatchet to the cassette I was viewing the film with. For such a wonderful and fulfilling character to go out like this was truly heartbreaking to watch, for all the wrong reasons.Peter Weller was the sensible actor, turning down the chance to reprise his most famous role a second time. He made the right choice, although his career has never so much as eyed the mild peak that the original RoboCop brought. Regular cast members such as Robert DoQui really made me wonder why they were in this piece of crap. Their characters have little to do, and their dialogue is so abysmal it makes one long for the subtleties of a Police Academy tour-de-force. After the way in which inflection turned three simple words into a bolt from the heavens during the original RoboCop, calling the dialogue here a disappointment is being overly polite.Then there was the main villain of the story. In the original, RoboCop battles a gang of hardened criminals, a poorly-designed battle droid, and his memories. In RoboCop 2, he battles with a drug lord who is used to create a new and improved cyborg. In RoboCop 3, he is battling a faceless bunch of wimps from the corporation that created him, and a Japanese cyborg called Otomo. The one ingredient that made RoboCop's enemies as compelling as they were was their personalities. Clarence Boddicker was an angry, hate-filled killer whose manner of behaviour and relating to others made one wonder if he was abused as a child. He was a match for RoboCop because one could feel an equal amount of fury coming from him whenever he was on-screen. In RoboCop 2, the main opponent for most of the film was a drug lord called Cain. This was a slight falter because Cain had all the personality of a squashed gnat, but the error was reversed when he was turned into RoboCop 2, a cyborg that took the Iron Man syndrome (listen to the Black Sabbath song of that name while watching parts of the original and you'll get what I mean by that) to new heights. Otomo had about ten minutes of screen time at most, and would have been ripped limb from limb by the RoboCop of the first film.RoboCop was one of the films that made my early life worth living, and I credit it with making me want to write scripts for films and television among other things. RoboCop 3 is basically one studio's effort to take everything that I hold near and dear, then basically insult and rape it for a few bucks. I utterly loathe and despise all who were involved with its production without being involved in either of the other two films. To those who did take part in the other two films, and then signed on for this pile of crap, all I have to say is why?...

Robocop decides to join the Cadillac Heights resistance & protect the innocent residents & their homes against OCP & the demolition crews...Co-written & directed by Fred Dekker one has to say that the original Robocop (1987) is one of the greatest sci-fi action films ever, Robocop 2 (1990) is right behind it as another great film which brings us on to Robocop 3 which in my humble opinion is simply terrible. The script by Dekker & graphic novel artist Frank Miller (Sin City, 300, Daredevil) is absolutely awful, everything which made the original Robocop so brilliant is gone, everything that made Robocop 2 such an entertaining sci-fi romp is gone & we are left with some kids film without any intelligence or trace of a meaningful plot. The biting satire, the cold hearted cynicism of big business, a really evil bad guy, the convincing portrayal of a future time & all the conviction from the original two Robocop films is sadly lacking. What we end up with in Robocop 3 is that the makers have tried to turn Robocop into some comic book character with the embarrassing climax where he gets rocket powered jets so he can fly, they give him some awful one-liners & have him team up with some annoying 'cute' kid to save the day & avenge the death of his partner. Which neatly brings me onto the clichés, the often used scenario of a cops partner being killed who then seeks revenge is here, the freedom fighters who live in sewers, the big business bosses who don't care about the 'liitle people' & a horribly sentimental ending in which Robocop saves everyone, he gets his revenge & the residents of Cadillack Heights get to stay in their homes. Did I mention it was very predictable as well, I didn't? Well, I guess I just did.Director Dekker ruins what was a great series of films & Robocop 3 undoubtedly killed the franchise off. I have no idea why but the violence is toned down to such a level Robocop 3 is pretty much PG stuff all the way, there are a few minor swear words but nothing to offend & not a single drop of blood. This just isn't a Robocop film as far as I'm concerned. The special effects are terrible too, the sequence at the end when Robocop flies is truly embarrassing to watch these days it really is. There are several continuities between this & the previous Robocop films, the company OCP, Johnson the executive, the 'I'd Buy that for a Dollar' advert, the SUX car, ED209 gets a small cameo & Sgt Reed is back as well. But while there are elements from the other Robocop films the tone is all wrong & it just comes across like a kids comic book superhero film. There are a couple of OK action scenes including a silly car chase when Robocop commandeers a pimps pink car & a few alright explosions. Certainly nothing to get that excited about.With a supposed budget of about $22,000,000 Robocop 3 opened with a disastrous weekend box-office take of less than four & a half million dollars, I guess the plan to get more people to watch it by toning down the violence & language didn't work. I wonder if Robocop 3 would have done better if it has been 'R' rated & featured lots of violence? I doubt it could have done any worse. Filmed in Atlanta, Georgia. The acting is awful from all concerned.Robocop 3 is an awful film, a film which I like to blank out & consider it not as part of the Robocop franchise which for me stopped after Robocop 2. Followed by the TV series Robocop (1994 - 1995) which ran for twenty three episodes & then the Canadian TV mini series Robocop Prime Derectives (2000) which has a running time of almost 400 minutes.

I sure hope there will be a possible 4th installment of RoboCop coming in the neat future; I've never seen these movies yet, but they do sure sound good! These movies are A-plus!!!!! Yes, they are!

There's Children Present ","Date":"6 January 2011","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" Paul Verhoeven,s ROBOCOP is quite rightly considered an 80s genre classic that successfully coupled violent visuals with a human story and biting satire . Audiences weren't bowled over by Irvin Kershner's 1990 sequel but is nowhere as bad as is often made out . Likewise ROBOCOP 3 has a very poor reputation but didn't deserve to spend several years in the IMDb bottom 100 Movies list. It's by far the least of the trilogy but its reputation lies not in the fact that it's a terrible film from a production point of view but more that the way the studio seem hell bent on making the franchise family friendly The bottom line is if you enjoyed the comic book graphic violence of Verhoeven's classic then you'll find this version totally lacking what made the original so enjoyable . Everything here seems to be produced to cause as much inoffence as possible . In fact if the producers had cut out several infrequent uses of the  S  word then you could actually class this as a family film . When people saw the original ROBOCOP did they envisage that a short time later they'd be watching a family friendly film franchise ? From the opening shot of a sweet innocent child who looks like she waltzed in from a Disney film down to the way it's only bad guys who get killed in a laughably bloodless way you realise you're watching something that jars with the other previous two movies . It's almost like watching an inversion of a STAR WARS sequel where Hans Solo snorts cocaine from Princess Leila's naked breasts before engaging in unnatural sex acts with her The story itself is very simplistic and plot wise it's no different from what you've seen in countless , forgettable B Western where cattle barons drive out the homesteaders from the territory . Substitute cattle barons for OCP and homesteaders for Detroit citizens , set it in the Mid West in the 19th century and you'd hardly have to change a word of dialogue . Even the climax of Murphy having to take on an android ninja seems culled from these corny movies of men in stetsons doing what a man has got to do . The fact that the protagonists are metal men doesn't make it less obvious I don't want to sound like I'm saying this is a great film - it's not - but neither is it one of the worst films ever made . It certainly deserves the tag of  Worst film featuring ROBOCOP in the title  . It probably wouldn't have such a poor reputation if it wasn't part of a franchise , one of which is considered a classic genre piece . I've certainly seen worse films featured on the SyFy channel this week "},{"Title":"Best of the Robocop Trilogy","Date":"1 January 2013","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi","Review":" This third installment of Robocop in my opinion is the finest of the trilogy, because it hits home in the most accurate way predicting the future.Detroit is now a police state owned by a private corporation OCP. Everything is now the property of OCP including the private residence of an individual, and if you resist eviction, police will come in with a wrecking ball, and full military assault weapons. Humans are reduced to property as well, and anyone who fall out of the system, and resist the tyranny of OCP and the police is labeled Terrorists.This is extremely close to the current situation of our country in that over half a million foreign troops are in United States because the US military has refused to shoot at American citizens. One executive order from the president can declare martial law, suspend constitution and privatize communication, transportation including cars, and property. It's amazing that this movie accurately predicted the future of the country 20 to 30 years before its time, and excites me to watch the take the producers had at the time the movie was made. The movie is well made, and contains irony as well as humor in the mix.For these reasons, this Robocop movie is the best of the three that's made for me.

Forget 'RoboCop 2', which was a nasty, shallow affair.  Although hampered by a weak storyline, this second sequel does at least try to recapture the atmosphere of Paul Verhoeven's masterpiece.  As in the first movie, most of the action takes place at night, Basil Poledouris' score sets the mood nicely, and even RoboCop himself walks properly again, rather than flaying him arms around as he did in the last film.The first 20 minutes or so of RoboCop 3 are really quite good (well, apart from the bit where the Cute Kid reprograms ED209 by connecting her laptop to its foot  -  in an increasingly computer-literate society, why does Hollywood insist on insulting our intelligence like this?).The only downsides were  Firstly, RoboCop is a total wuss!  After the beatings he took in 1 and 2, in 3 he's almost killed when a grenade bounces off his chest, and then nearly passes out then the Ninja cuts off his fingers.  As if!  The other main letdown is a very weak final 30 minutes. Flying robots and duelling ninjas belong to straight-to-video cheapies, not major studio releases.I would recommend this film to anyone who liked the 1987 original, and warn them to steer clear of RoboCop 2.

Why did they have to change a really well cast Peter Weller as the cybernetic cop, to a rubbish Robert John Burke. I can't remember any of the story apart from RoboCop going into some kind of sewer or something to live for a while. That's about it. It's obviously Robert John Burke that makes this film the most stupid of the three. I can't remember seeing any good fight or gun scenes, and no good special effects like Paul Verhoeven's film. You remember the guy melting! Also starring Men in Black's Rip Torn somewhere. Adequate!

A large company is pretty much pulling people from their homes and putting them into camps so Robocop decides to help them out. Director Dekker has become a cult favorite thanks to films like NIGHT OF THE CREEPS and THE MONSTER SQUAD but sadly this film misses the mark on just about every level and a lot of the blame has to go to the screenplay by Dekker and Frank Miller. I'm really not sure what the two were thinking or perhaps their original vision was shot down by the studio? I'm not sure but they've pretty much taken everything that worked in the two films and destroyed them. We do get quite a bit of social commentary here but it's all pointless because there's not a single scene where you actually think this could happen in the future. The idea of picking people up and throwing them into camps will remind some of what happened in WWII and how it plays out and is executed here just isn't believable and there's not a single second where a common sense question isn't punching holes in the story. Another problem is that the studio (or filmmakers) decided to go all safe and cut out the violence and give us a PG-13 rating. Again, I'm not sure why this was done but it did happen to a few 80s series including MAJOR LEAGUE, which had a raunchy R-rated movie be turned into a watered-down kids flick. This film here is still too dark for kids and with all the comic tones and childish nature the filmmakers pretty much ruin it for the adults as well. Even worse is the decision to turn Robocop into a comic book hero with all sorts of bad action scenes, silly dialogue and a god-awful idea of giving him a rocket pack to fly around with. Robert John Burke replaced Peter Weller in this film but he's really not able to bring any life to the character. Nancy Allen is back briefly but her role just becomes even more thankless. Rip Torn does a good job as the evil CEO and we also get CCH Pounder as the leader of the people. ROBOCOP 3 was laughed out of theaters when it was released and the only thing time has done to it is make it even more embarrassing. There were elements that could have made for a good movie but there's just too much kiddie material that rises up and ruins everything.
