Mariah Carey's first and so far only feature film is an example of how the combined MPAA and RIAA attempts to shovel garbage at us are starting to backfire. Sales of Mariah's recordings, once one of the highlights of an otherwise dreary RIAA mainstream catalogue, have slumped. It's all because of this film. Don't let the blind Mariah fans fool you - it is just as bad as critics say, and deserving of its bottom 100 status.Where to begin when pulling apart this cinematic abortion? For me, the first major problem was the cinematography. If the viewer is not clued in on the fact that Vondie Curtis-Hall has only directed television before this film as it starts, the flat, Days-Of-Our-Lives-style shots will soon make it clear enough. Directors who put one or two actors, three tops, in a 2.351 frame are a dime a dozen. On the other hand, directors who cannot even differentiate these actors' spacing from the camera truly stand out, and not in a good way.The story has been described as being syrupy enough to kill anyone who suffers from diabetes (or doesn't), and I am not going to contest that. It's a variation upon the classic rags to riches theme, specifically tailored towards Mariah. Mariah essentially plays herself in the guise of a young vocalist who starts singing backup for a considerably less talented vocalist. As she crosses the paths of more people, eventually said people twig to the fact that she can vocalise with the best of them. One DJ eventually picks her up, manages her through a record deal, and promises her that one day she *will* play in Madison Square Garden, or something along those lines.This kind of story has been done before, with such real-life examples as the Jacksons providing source material for one excellent miniseries of the theme. The problem here is that we've heard this story a million times before. Another significant problem is that while Mariah has a voice many would kill for, there is absolutely nothing that stands out, even slightly about her material. As an old girlfriend of mine once said, the longer it takes the RIAA to twig to the fact that being female doesn't mandate wanting to hear this formulaic ballad crap, the more business they are going to lose to independents who support bands like Opera IX. I think the fact that Mariah's last album disappeared without trace in spite of having millions of dollars spent on its promotion proves her right.Mariah's story is also incredibly bland, to say the least. So her junkie mother gave her up when she was young. Oh boo hoo. It happens, and you're probably better off for it, get over it already. The previously-mentioned Jacksons could run rings around the likes of Mariah Carey for sob stories, and their reluctance to deal with the media at large is a telling thing. So in the end, we are simply left with another example of the mainstream trying to seem alternative, and failing.I gave Glitter a one out of ten. I don't think I am being too harsh. I think it is so amazingly bad that it becomes comedic, at least on the first viewing. I suspect that repeated viewings will simply become boring.

And that just makes it boring-bad instead of spectacularly bad. And though Mariah is plenty vacuous in the starring role, she doesn't reach the heights of strenuously bad acting that Elizabeth Berkeley does in Showgirls. The only element of this movie that satisfies my so-bad-it's-good criteria is the character of Mariah's boyfriend.

It's yet another rewrite of A Star Is Born, here turned into a vehicle for pop star Mariah Carey and apparently patterned after her own rise to the top (audiences weren't fooled, however, by the updated, late-night-movie clichés). Carey's funky/erotic music is driving (and her performance as blazing new talent Billie Frank is adequate), but the script for Glitter seems left over from the 1950s. Didn't the writers realize that times have changed and that Billie didn't have to be such a diva-doormat? Actresses of a lot higher caliber than Mariah Carey have fallen into this trap--they just don't want to see themselves on the screen acting bitchy and tough, so they end up playing the simp. Glitter features some rich cinematography (nice shots of the Big Apple), but it is too soft to make an impression--even as an unintended comedy. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Scary star vehicle","Date":"5 May 2005","Score":"15 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":" Even fans of bad movies will have a tough time with Glitter, which commits a number of gross sins while it is on your screen. Unlike the similarly-panned Showgirls, Glitter doesn't go far enough over the top to be of any interest, and it takes itself way too seriously. Showgirls made me feel giddy while I was watching it. Glitter made me feel as if I had been poisoned.What an unfortunate mis-step for star Mariah Carey, who gets sucked up into the vacuum of this movie like a dust bunny under the Hoover. It's not that Mariah is terrible, exactly. She doesn't seem like much of an actress, and she definitely doesn't have much screen presence. But the real problem is that she doesn't really do much except smile, sing, and look pretty. She simply exists. Perhaps since Glitter is touted as a semi-autobiographical film like Purple Rain, the producers thought being Mariah Carey would be enough to carry the film. Her role is shallow and one-dimensional, despite the fact that the script tries to give her some depth by piling on the age-old wayward childhood cliché. The problem is we've seen all of this so often that it's very silly.It only gets worse as the movie progresses. After Mariah's character, Billie, grows up, she meets an obnoxious club DJ who, much to our horror, turns out to be the movie's other main character. Carey and her costar, Max Beesley, have next to zero screen chemistry, but for some reasons she falls in love with him.The director throws in a bunch of gimmicky techniques, like speeding up the film, as well as a hilariously awful cut that goes from Mariah's face to fireworks exploding. There is also a laugh-out-loud moment where the actress who plays the young Billie Frank joins her mother onstage and when she opens her mouth to sing, it is Mariah Carey's voice that comes out of her--pitched up until she sounds a little like Minnie Mouse. No wonder Mariah collapsed after this was released.There are some absurd and awful moments in the film that have nothing to do with Mariah, most notably her two obnoxious friends who are directed as complete caricatures and seem to be intended for some sort of comic relief (there's plenty of that in other places, all of it unintentional).Beesley is supposed to be a big-time club DJ, yet he plays more like a kid at a high-school dance. The role is all wrong for him. For some inexplicable reason, the film is set in the early 80s, yet more often than not it looks suspiciously like the early 00's (especially the furniture). The dialog is unmemorable and nobody has any real acting to do in this film, except for one or two emotional moments. The drama is uninvolving, and it doesn't really spiral out of control until the conclusion of the movie, where it soars so far into the absurd that we finally get some good bad movie stuff (a big fight, a beating, a murder, a campy moment of triumph onstage). It's too little, too late though.The one thing that Glitter manages to carry off is a cliché but somewhat engaging scene where Billie finally meets up her long-lost mother. Unfortunately, it is the final scene of the movie, and the camera sails right up into the sky just when we get to the one moment in the film that works.

Not great but not terrible. I think the greatest flaw in the film that there has not been that was not enough time dedicated to explaining certain aspects of Billie's emotions. There should have been more about her father and how that reflected her relationship with Dice. But when it comes to plot, it is fairly predictable, but there is a reason why there are so many films that share this plot line about fame A Star Is Born, Dreamgirls etc., it is a part of fame. The main problem is the script, without a good script, the true potential for acting is limited. Now when it comes to the acting, I'll admit it is not great but no means it is terrible. Terrible acting is Jessica Simpson in The Dukes of Hazzard and Blonde Ambition. I think it is time for people to stop treating this film as if it is the worst film to grace the screen, there are far worse films and this film, while not the greatest, should get the benefit of a doubt.

I am 100% a fan of Mariah Carey....as a singer. It's almost like what the girls in the '60s probably had when they looked at the Beatles. Whenever she's on TV or I listen to her music,I just naturally feel good. However,when it comes to Glitter,yes I,like most,was really let down. I wont even go into the plot since it's a moot point at this time. 5 years or 100 will not change or make this film any better. Even though I'm a fan,I'm not so one sided in thought that I'd just accept it all. This film was a mistake from the beginning. Even the soundtrack is not all that as they say. Although I do like the song Never Too Far & Loverboy . (That's why I gave 2 stars).I heard about this film going into production back in 1998. Now,when a film takes nearly 3 years to make,that's the very first warning sign that it's not going to work. Not to mention some publicized production problems I read about. Mariah herself stated recently on Oprah that she just wasn't good at saying no during the dizzying pace of her career in the 90's. I'm sure this was just something she contractually said yes to and moved on. Then,as happens with all super-stars (I hate that term) the low came after 11 years of riding high. There wasn't anything wrong with her music,she'd just been working too hard,too long and that's what led to this embarrassing moment and the one in 2002 on Total Request Live aka TRL. She has of course rebounded from all this,her song,We Belong Together spent 14 weeks at #1 last summer and the CD Emancipation of Mimi has sold millions. She can now do what she wants at her own pace. In closing,today is March 27th. Happy birthday Mariah,as far as I'm concerned you at least deserve one review that isn't filled with venom.

Given nothing but a bare-boned outline of a plot to work with, Ms. Carey explodes across the screen with a depth and complexity of character unseen since Vivian Leigh's multi-faceted Scarlet O'Hara in Gone with the Wind back in 1939.            Every colour of the rainbow, and some even out of the range of the known colour scheme, are clearly and sharply delineated by Mariah in every frame of this masterpiece; every subtle shade and nuance of Billie Frank is drawn with precision sharpness and crystal clarity.  It is said that the ultimate sign of true artistry in film is when one can look at any single frame of a motion picture and instantly know what is going on just from the facial expressions and body language of the actors within.  Glitter certainly exemplifies this theory.  At any given moment, one can look at Mariah's Billie Frank and instantly see every idiosyncrasy of the woman inside.  The relationships she has with, and her feelings towards, every character she interacts with in the film is beautifully fleshed-out and drawn with a broad brush.  Each and every word Mariah speaks in Glitter was meticulously delivered by her, and obviously carefully studied during perusal of the script.     Mariah delivers infinitely more than the one-dimensional Billie other reviews have led us to expect.  Her transitions from despondency, to loneliness, to anger, to triumph...all brought forth with a crispness and clarity unknown to this age of the cinematic experience.  And the ease with which she presents all these ranges of emotion draws you into the character of Billie, to the point where you hang breathlessly on Mariah's next word.  She has such a natural talent, such an incredible comfort in front of the camera, that you instantly forget you are watching an actress playing Billie; you believe she really is Billie.    This can only be the smallest taste of what is to come from this future screen legend.  Mariah has made her mark on the film industry, and now can, and must, move on to deeper, more complex roles...she must rightfully stake her claim as one of the greatest screen presences in cinema history.  How marvelous it would be to see her take on some of the great female characters of literary classics, so in vogue today.  A Jane Eyre, for example, or Lizzy in Pride and Prejudice.  Many of Shakespeare's greatest works have remained uncommitted to celluloid; what greater compliment to the works of the master himself than to have them graced by Mariah Carey?     Please, do yourself a favour; you must see this movie, and see it with an open mind.  Those who scoff are simply those who had already decided that Mariah would be a failure in the cross-over from music to film.  They cannot admit they were wrong; for, unlike Barbra Streisand and Madonna before her, embarrassments both, Mariah Carey is a fabulous, fantastic, brilliant actress.  Again, look at everything she was able to do with this meagre script!!!       Mariah Carey is the most stunningly beautiful, breathtaking, sexy, sensuous, heart-stopping woman ever to appear on the stage or screen.  So many times during this movie, I realized that I was so captivated by her beauty that I wasn't even breathing; my heart was pounding so fiercely at the sight of her, I though it would burst.       Believe me, Mariah...keep acting...keep singing...you will always be remembered as a priceless legend.

Now I'm not saying that this review is completely un-biased, after all, I'd been brought up on a healthy diet of Mariah Carey, but I did rent this movie a few weeks ago (it being not released to cinema) due to pure curiosity.The multi-octave song-bird's film vehicle (originally titled 'All That Glitters... a much better name I think) opens with in the early 1960's, in an all-black bar with a woman (Valarie Pettiford) singing a jazz/blues number before introducing her young daughter, Billie Frank (Isobel Gomes), to the semi-interested audience and the two launch into a duet which wows the crowd. Cut to the next few shots where Billie's mother tries to get money from Billie's father, before giving her up to an adoption agency.Fast-foward to the bright and bouncy 1980's where all-grown-up Billie (the aforementioned Carey) is dancing in a club with her two best friends Louise and Roxy (Da Brat and Tia Texada), who are soon offered as back-up singing gig for no-talent, good-looking up-and-comer Sylk. Needing the money, the 3 take the job, and the producer finds Mariah's... er... Billie's voice completely spellbinding - and chooses to use her voice instead of the God-awful voice that the main singer is belting out.A recording of a song entitled All My Life is handed to a Club DJ - DJ Dice to be exact (British actor Max Beesley who puts on a 'wigga' accent - sometimes really good, other times really bad) who plays it and instantly falls in love with the vocals. Upon discovering that the vocal used is in fact Billie's he instantly wants to be her producer (of course her beautiful looks have nothing to do with it!). So, makes a deal with her old producer Timothy (Terrence Howard) to take the gorgeous Billie and her back-up singing, loud-mouthed friends and take them under his wing - for the reasonable (!) price of ONLY $100,000! So the Dice & Billie end up becoming good friends and record a song, I Didn't Mean To Turn You On, and it is played for music executives, and before you can change the butt groove in your seat, Billie is signed to a major record label.Of course, the road to musical superstardom is not an easy one and Billie has several troubles - the video director for her first single Loverboy wants her to parade around in nothing but a piece of string (Billie minds, Mariah wouldn't) and there's also the little problem of her undeniable attraction to Dice. The two become an item and she even moves into Dice's modern, typically New York apartment. Billie's first single unsurprisingly tops the U.S. chart - for ten weeks, at which point the record company are eager to release her first album which they want full control over - p***ing off both Billie and Dice.Our star-crossed 80's lovers start fighting as her career begins to blossom. She's invited to all the right parties and invited to guest on all the right talk shows - a dream she's had for many years, but amist all of the amazing goings-on, her two best friends are seeing less and less of her and Dice is becoming a drag - she even has to bail him out of jail before an appearance on a show. The two have a massive fight, leading Billie to move out (and Girl Power-ly slap his face). Her attempts at tracking down her addicted biological mother fail as the adoption agency have lost contact with her. Also during this time, she records a single with pop singer Rafael (Halle Berry's musician hubby Eric Benét). The duet, titled Want You is another number one for Billie, and her biggest dream is about to come true - she's about to play at Madison Square Garden.The day of the concert arrives and Billie returns to Dice's apartment to find him not there. Unfortunately Billie's day won't exactly go as planned - it seems, achieving your dreams sometimes means that you'll lose the ones you love. And with that, I won't go into the final minutes' in detail, but I'll just say that is very emotional.So that's the story, but were the performances any good? Well yes and no. Mariah Carey (although despite what you've no doubt heard) is a promising actress. Her acting isn't brilliant (yet) - there are times when you feel she goes overboard (especially in the emotional bits). I've found that her most convincing scenes (and therefore best ones) are where she gets angry. Her stereotypical best friends are good too and add a needed comical element. Beesley as DJ Dice is good, although he sometimes seems very fake. Anyone else worth noticing is probably OK.The soundtrack is brilliant. Carey's 9th studio album is a pop/r&b LP with great recordings. From the pumping 80's tracks (Last Night A DJ Saved My Life, Didn't Mean To Turn You On, All My Life) to the gorgeous Mariah-like ballads (Lead The Way, Reflections and especially Never Too Far) plus the Eric duet 'Want You' and the Ja Rule infected 'If We' - it's just as good as her previous efforts.Overall, 'Glitter' IS a film that the troubled songbird should be proud of. It is a drama, though - and watch that, don't think it'll be laugh-a-minute. It's emotional, passionate and with Carey in the lead - it's one rollercoaster ride you'll like at the time and will leave you wanting more. Recommended definetely... Go Mariah!

Please, someone tell me! I mean, this had to have been a joke, right? Big deal, Billie went from rags to riches. Do you know how many movies like that are out there? I'll answer that - plenty.This movie does have one REALLY good use, though. They can show it to people that we want information from! The torture would be too much to take for ANYONE, and they would divulge any information that we need in a matter of minutes.I have to throw up right now even thinking about how bad this movie was. Anyone who gave this movie more than one star is on crack..89/10 starts (the .89 is just because Mariah is in the movie.)

The acting is atrocious, the script full of cliches, and Mariah's wardrobe is used either as an attempt to call attention away from her bad acting, or to audition for a layout in a men's magazine.  As the movie has been on a movie channel, I did end up watching the entire thing - although I had to do it in bits and pieces to retain my sanity.There are many scenes that are totally pointless and last all of thirty seconds. One of the best, ie worst, is when she and Dice walk into the suite of the record company, the business men say you've got a contract, and champagne glasses are raised - end scene. That is literally the scene and actually probably doesn't even last twenty seconds. There is no extra dialogue or any other action - walk in, you got the contract, I'll drink to that, scenes over.  It is the type of writing I did when I was in junior high.This is a bad, bad film. The more I think about it, there are many similarities between this film and A Star is Born.

GLITTER is considered one of the worst movies ever made. Is it? I really don't think so but at the same time there's no question that it's really bad but I think with a little common sense the thing could have worked. There are way too many problems going on here, which could have been corrected and we can start with the screenplay. I'm guessing people just watched every rise-to-fame story out there, gathered all the cliché moments and threw them into this. There's really nothing that happens here that the viewer won't see coming from a mile away and worse of all is that none of the clichés are even given little pinches of something fresh or original. Even worse is the fact that there's really no one here to root for. The Carey character is pretty bland, boring and there's never a single second where we feel bad for her. I'm guess that Carey and company just figured since people knew it was based on her that we'd immediately have a connection with her. It doesn't work this way. You're still playing a character. You still need to bring some life to that character. The screenplay still needs to give that character something to do and the viewer something to feel for. Another major problem is that the new music here is just downright bad and it's certainly nothing you'll enjoy listening to. This here could have been corrected had the film just used Carey's previous hits but I guess they didn't want to pay the extra money that it would have cost to use them. Finally, Carey herself is just downright awful here. No matter if she's happy, sad, angry and calm, she has the exact same reaction all the time. She really doesn't bring this character to life and never is she believable in the part. When you can't get any form of emotion across it's hard to make an emotional story work. Max Beesley and Terrence Howard are both good in their roles but their talents are sadly wasted. GLITTER is a really bad movie but everything wrong with it could have easily been fixed. Sadly, in the end, the producers just took a cheap and easy fix and the viewers had to suffer for it.

Mariah has such a strong personality , it overwhelms the whole picture, it was no problem for me . i was looking for the story anyway. but my point is , if another actress would have done this job , the movie could have been accepted much better and maybe get an Oscar. not that there is something wrong with Mariah as an actress, but the fact that she is playing actually herself might look a bit self crowning. maybe that is the reason why so much people disliked this movie . you are a great singer , and you play yourself in a movie to show how great you are. that was plus and plus and too much plus for yourself , and will end up in negative. if you are so cool and so great it just looks better if someone else will do that acting roll , instead of when you will do it yourself.that didn't matter for me , i loved the story . i will watch it again and enjoy sometime soon. if you love the 80s and the life around that time , this movie is a MUST SEE.

That's if the quality of the acting and writing had remained the same. The musical quality, on the other hand, never went down--except of course for the fact that the music early on was more sophisticated and much of what came later was mindless but fun dance pop. If you like the kind of music Mariah Carey is known for, Glitter delivers. Most of the time I would consider a lot of that music to be garbage. But Mariah is one of the few singers of her style I can stand to listen to, and given that this style of music would be dominant in this movie, I actually found myself enjoying it. All the musicians were talented--except, of course, Sylk--who was secretly replaced by the phenomenal Billie as lead singer and didn't seem to know it as her mike was turned down and Billie's was turned up.I didn't think this movie was so bad overall. Sure, it's depressing, but plenty of good movies are. This wasn't outstanding, but it appeared to be telling a good story. Most of the actors were doing a good job. Toward the end, though, I realized this movie wasn't going to finish what it started, because it was only supposed to run for two hours including commercials. So the finish seemed kind of abrupt, and shocking. Nevertheless, the ending turned out to be satisfying.Of course, everyone seemed to point to one weakness in this movie. Yes, it was obvious Mariah had little acting experience. But in some scenes, I felt she did just fine. In others, where she had no challenge, she seemed capable of only three facial expressions, and one in particular. Wow, if she had really been that happy, this would have been a fun movie. Mariah probably was enjoying herself. Billie, maybe.

In the beginning it sets things up like the mothers abandonment is going to be a central theme, but only touches on the subject on a few occasions. It also keeps skipping between the romance with Dice and Mariah's music career without much connection. Pick a theme and go with it!My third criticism is that this kind of rags to riches type story has been done so many times before.

It could be, from very very merciful angle, an anti-alcoholism public service announcement, yet through the behavior of scriptwriters ! And if it is, as I heard, partly Mariah Carey's biography, then the tagline should be In music she found her dream, her love, herself. Not cinema ! OK, I said to myself, so what about the songs? However as a fan of Mariah Carey's music and voice (like me), or not, you must hate these songs. The only track that worth hearing, Want You; a duet with (Eric Benét), is butchered in the background of one scene, even (Benét) got no respectable character during it !! Some of the songs were so 80s, and sorrowfully I mean it in the bad sense.The acting was extremely UGLY. (Max Beesley) must work in any other line than acting. (Mariah Carey) earned the Worst Actress award for that year fair and square. Speaking about ugliness, one of the most famous beauties back then, Mariah herself, looked really not beautiful for most of the time. Maybe that's the effect of this movie on her ! I hated it for making nothing to be watched, heard, or bearable. The release of it was postponed for 3 weeks when Mariah was hospitalized as a result of an emotional and physical breakdown. Till now I believe that that happened due to undeclared reason which is watching this movie before releasing it (and I'm not kidding!).You read that it is listed among the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book (The Official Razzie® Movie Guide). Now I beg to differ. Bad it is. Enjoyably? It isn't. In fact it doesn't require any culture or smartness to comprehend that the only watchable, and enjoyable, thing here is the scene in which Mariah Carey was wearing that gray bikini. Although I hate gray, but who cares ? If only she made the whole movie in it !!

Well, I read somewhere that the director of Glitter had only worked with television before and wow, is this obvious. The cinematography is flat and dull, broken only by about five thousand pan shots over the city--okay, okay, we get it, she's in New York--and the treacly, slow-motion shots of Mariah leaping into her skeevy boyfriend's/DJ's arms.When it comes to octaves, boy, has the woman got range. But nowhere else. She can't act worth crap, and on a related note, I can't stand to watch her sing. She's always whipping her head around emotionally and pouting. What a voice--why can't she do something worthwhile with it?! ...oh, and don't forget her supposed naiveté and innocence--I loved it!! Mariah is so shy about being dressed in a silver bikini, sniffle sniffle. I loved the scene with her boyfriend (Dice) leaping in to rescue her when she's too uncomfortable with the beefy Chippendale-types crawling all over her in a video shoot. She looks on the verge of tears and totally ridiculous--sort of like she's got bugs under her skin and is trying to squirm them out--but the director is shouting, Yes, yes, perfect! Uh, did he WANT her to look like she was being molested? Later, studly, sensitive Dice decries her publicity photos by sniffing that she looks like a porn star. P--porn star? gulps Mariah, horrified. In almost every scene, though, she's dressed in something short and skin-tight. P--porn star? But I'm so ch--chaste and v--virginal! Mariah sniffles like she's shy and humble and innocent throughout the movie, an act which is punctuated by brief scenes in which she belts out formulaic pop ballads like a woman who's been performing for a decade and a half. Every so often, there is a scene to indicate that she's climbed another rung on the ladder--for example, she's on TV briefly/Dice sees a headline reading that she's sold out Madison Square Garden--but none of them explain how or why. All we know is that she didn't finish a video. Oh, and she had a song on the radio once. Nice development. They must have cut about a mile and a half of film out of this thing.The best example of Mariah's incredible acting ability can be found in a scene in which Timothy, the music producer with whom Dice has made some sort of secret monetary deal, breaks into their apartment. Mariah is alone, and her expression does not change once during a scene in which he slowly saunters towards her to grab her face and growl, I don't want to hurt you...but I will. It's hilarious to watch her cheeks being squashed while her eyes continue to stare blankly into some void. (Despite being in the kitchen, by the way, she doesn't make a move towards anything that might protect her.) At one point, she asks Timothy how he got into the apartment, and he doesn't answer. Clearly the writers didn't care to figure it out either.The ending is so perfect and wonderfully contrived that I can't do it justice here. Let's just say that Mariah leaves the concert at Madison Square Garden, finds a note from Dice, and goes immediately from NYC to Maryland in her limo. From the concert. She's still dressed in the glittery gown she performed in. Guess the limo driver didn't have anywhere to be that night. Fantastic!

I guess......Figuring out this movie is like figuring out when Tax day is. They're always the same. They've made this movie 40 times, but this time they did it with Mariah Carey, singer extrodinaire with limited acting experience and it shows. The movie follows Billie Frank, a NYC girl from a broken home. She sings her heart out as a backup singer who gets little respect. Her producer at the times friend, a local DJ (Max Beesley), hears her and instantly wants to be her new producer. He buys her for $100,000 (It's the 80's, that's more like $1,000,000 nowadays) and immediately gets her pressed and played. Sure, happens just that quick. she laments about her long lost mother, they argue, he gets dumped as producer,she isn't sure of anything,he gets shot and killed, she sings for him,makes it big time,she finds mom, credits. The movie is just that simple.Now for the 'good' parts The Acting. If there was any, it came from the extras. They put their heart and souls into creating a real world look to the film. It really does look like the real world. No one looks right in the camera and they speak in the background. Mariah isn't awful. She isn't. The parts where she starts crying are real. She suddenly realized that she was in a bad,bad,bad film and just let it out. The look on the other actors faces tells the audience that it's not in the script. She does this several times. Can't blame her, she really should have warmed up better by doing a few more 'acting' gigs.  Mariah is one level above Porn actress. Everyone else is wretched.Whoever wrote this script should be shot. It couldn't be less original. And NO NUDITY? Why else are teenage boys going to show up? It didn't have to be Mariah, but someone should have been, it's almost always in these scripts. It's the only thing they have. Not this one. Her friends in the film weren't good subjects for it, so they should have found 2 unknowns and just stripped them down a few times. It would have turned up the attitude a bit. And I don't look for nudity in films. Just THESE FILMS!!!  To conclude, If you're not a big fan of her music, put a big pass on this one. I saw it on HBO, so it was almost free. And I still want some compensation.

I don't think that acting is one of her strongest talents, at least not at the moment.  Even some of the best acting skills could not salvage this film. Terrence Howard is an amazing actor (The Best Man, Dead Presidents, et al.), but he seemed to be wasted on a one dimensional thug role.I think somewhere along the way, Glitter got caught up in its own superstar flashiness.  The story was never fully supported from the begining. Billy's black momma gives her up after their home burns down and she loses her job. Oh yeah, and her white father wants nothing to do with either of them.  I think that was an interesting storyline that could have been developed further to make Billy a deeper character.  I kept asking myself the question what role did her biracial roots, her single-parent home and her socially paranoid father play in making her who she became?  Was it just a weak explaination of why Billy wanted her mother's approval or why a very fair pop star can blow like the queens of Soul.  I wanted to see some turmoil from Miss Billy Frank, some reserve being romantically involved with a white man after the trauma of being abandoned by her white father (fathers play a huge role in who a woman chooses in a mate), perhaps some lack of acceptance from other black children, etc.  I didn't even understand exactly what role her upbringing played upon her desire to become a star.  Did she want money? Did she want fame?  Did she want her mother's acceptance?  It didn't even seem like she thought of her mother except for a few hokey instances and I just could not feel the truth in them.  Her romance with Dice seemed equally lukewarm.  I did not feel any chemistry between them.  In fact for most of the movie (that I could watch without gasping in fits of frustration)I wanted Billy to be a stronger, more proactive character rather than simply being an object to all characters including herself.I could go on and on, but I digress.  I would like to think that Vondie Curtis Hall did the best with what he was given a weak script.  I think that Glitter may have been an interesting concept (without biting off Mahogany).  It succeeded in only scratching the surface of the industry and the rise of a pop star.  In a sense, Glitter fell prey to the superficiality that the industry is itself notorious for.  Ironic? Maybe.

I think what made Mariah look like a bad actress is that she's trying to play a girl-next-door who we're all supposed to feel sorry for because her mother left her. The problem is that we all know about Mariah's diva-ism in real life. It's hard for us to feel sorry for her. Max Beesley was the horrible one in this movie.

She's a great singer. I just think she doesn't take advice well. She ignored her mom's advice and dated and married Tommy Motola, although he's 25 years her senior. She then wanted out of the marriage for finally seeing what everyone else saw long ago. She then was supposed to have matured, as evidenced by the videos for Honey and Butterfly. But, although she can still sing, she keeps trying to be younger than she is (her clothing seems to get skimpier) and she continues to sing schmaltzy corn like Boyfriend which she had to sell at bargain basement prices ($.79!) just to barely make gold. But, she can still sing as I Didn't Mean to Turn You On from this movie will attest.Now, onto the film. Mariah bashers aside, this movie suffers from Mariah's own actions. As an actress, she's okay, probably on par with Madonna. But, like Madonna, she seems to think she's a better actress than she really is, hence, she got upset when film goers didn't agree with her.Another problem is the plot. The story is almost autobiographical, but Mariah plays it like she's never experienced it before. It's like she's following cue cards in almost every scene. Her scenes where she sings are great, but even Madonna sang great in Dick Tracy. The script moves too quickly, taking Billie (her character) from obscurity to stardom so quickly, no one has time to even check for plausibility. Mariah's own meteoric rise wasn't this fast.Her romance with Max is cheesy. He hears her record, then falls for her music and buys out her contract with another producer (for $100,000). He then slowly falls for her. Come on. Even Tommy Mottola was laughing at that premise.Most glaring of all is that Mariah used her star clout to push for a lot of things she shouldn't have. She wanted all the credit (and got all the subsequent work) on the soundtrack. She wanted in on the movie's editing sessions. Other times, she let people take her for granted, even when she had questions and reservations about scenes. She picked the songs she wanted released to the radio. All of this led to that famous mental breakdown in 2001. When the movie came out, it naturally garnered bad reviews, mostly because Mariah (and the production company) had been hyping it as the next best thing to sliced bread instead. It couldn't live up to its own lofty goals. The songs picked for radio release were okay, but nothing to make people rush out to buy the album or see the movie. Overall, it had bad marketing. People I know who actually saw it think it might have some decent potential in the video market. Ironically, pop star Britney Spears had more success with her film debut (Crossroads) because she did the opposite of Mariah. She made herself part of an ensemble cast, so she wouldn't shoulder the burden. She didn't oversell the movie. She targeted an audience and played to their expectations. She marketed the movie well and didn't pass it off as a blockbuster. As a result, it did decent business at the box office and made a good profit.As for Glitter, it was like Mariah Carey tried to force it down our throats (It's about me, so you should like it as much as you like my music). Unfortunately, it's a clear case of too much promise, too little delivery.On a good note, Mariah's young and, unlike Madonna, she can still learn from her mistakes.

They fall in love and while her star rises, his falls, and tragedy ensues. Sound familiar? It should since this tale's been around for ages, most notably 2 versions of A Star Is Born, the last remake featuring Barbra Streisand. Don't think for a moment that this is any coincidence what modern-day pop 'diva' (an overused term that, once and for all, should be laid to rest...PERMANENTLY!) wouldn't want the adulation, the stardom, the career, not to mention the awards, of someone like Streisand? It's certainly understandable that it might seem like a fine career move to place Mariah Carey in a film where she not only gets to sing but emote amid all the trials and tribulations of a star-crossed love. Unfortunately, while Streisand, and other singers-turned-actors have displayed not only admirable acting chops but a discernible style all their own, Mariah is basically a one-trick pony. Yes, she can hit lots of high notes. But in this day and age of Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, and other big-voiced singers, she's a dime-a-dozen, with no real personality of her own to speak of; if anything, she merely seems like a corporate creation, a feeling that overwhelms not only HER but her starring debut. In her defense, Carey probably gives the best performance she possibly could, though it's hard to tell the woman simply cannot act; all emotions are displayed by her opening her eyes wide and pouting, or grinning and tossing her hair. She also seems wildly uneasy in front of the camera (at times, she seems like she wants to disappear) though she hardly has any help from her director, Vondie Curtis-Hall (a talented actor/sometime-director who should know better!), or her co-stars (most especially Max Beasley, a bargain-basement Mark Wahlberg, who richly deserves his Razzie nomination). She's also not exactly benefitting from a tired story line, a god-awful screenplay (I dare anyone to care about these people or what happens to them) OR the  music, some of which are '80's tunes, some of which are new (these are tuneless little ditties that resemble schoolgirl-diary poems), and none of which suits her particular style of singing, which is either extremely loud or extremely breathy - she alternates between the two for no real apparent reason, and either way, it's quite often impossible to discern just what the hell the words are! I won't really bother retelling the plot because it hardly matters - you've heard it all before anyway. I CAN tell you about the look of the film, however AT NO POINT IN TIME WILL YOU BELIEVE THIS IS SET IN THE '80s!!! Anachronisms abound from Max Beasley's Dice character's whole shtick to the clothes and hairstyles of all involved, to the sets, it all seems far removed from anything '80s. Mariah in particular is clothed in the most unflattering costumes, which, combined with the harsh, cool cinematography and stark make-up, serve only to make its star look rather haggard and unintentionally pudgy. She's cruelly photographed throughout. Then again, no one comes off well in this film. The whole affair, though touted as 'big-budget', smacks of an amateurish cheap-o flick that the studio put together to satisfy its star and her people. It also doesn't quite make it as a modern camp classic, though it may warrant repeated viewings for those in the mood for bad movie-making. Certainly the DVD of this film supplies any number of laughs start with the video of Loverboy, which features two talentless rap singers (I know that's redundant) and Mariah in her her Daisy Dukes outfit, flailing about in some strange and vain attempt at being sexy - you can clearly see that this woman is losing it!! (I also defy you to understand the lyrics.) It's a hoot, most especially considering her meltdown on MTV not long before the film was released. Also much unintentional fun is the director's commentary, wherein Vondie Curtis-Hall discusses, presumably with a straight face, the importance of his film, and offers how meaningful even the most pointless moments are.

The trials and tribulations of Billie Frank just ain't much to write (or sing) home about.  I suppose it is human nature to want to see suffering and pain, but whatever.  There isn't much of it in this movie, and what little there was is portrayed in a very benign and mundane way. Apart from that, the dialog is lame (Wow, that is so fresh!), the characters are fairly one-dimensional, and the film does a poor job of recreating 1983. I'm not sure why I felt the need to review this movie, but I guess in a way I feel sorry for Mariah Carey.  It isn't the worst movie in the world, and it looks like she did the best she could.  I don't recommend it, though, unless you are a pre-teen girl or a big fan of Carey's. Yes, Mariah can sing, but if you want to hear that you might as well buy one of her albums. If you want to see a good movie about the life of a singer, try The Rose instead.  )  "},{"Title":"Worse than Britney's first movie...","Date":"26 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  But not by much.Avoid like Mariah's last album.Mariah should keep to singin... er... maybe she should just quit.

Besides, I like Mariah Carey--as a singer--and felt, Hey, at least there might be some good music.There are a few good songs and Mariah is beautiful, but this film is utter crap!!!  Why this was even released in theaters beats me!  It should've been just shown on VH1.The plot couldn't be more predictable and the premise couldn't be more cliched.  Mariah Carey plays a normal, everyday girl who dreams of becoming a superstar and ends up rising to the top, having to cope with the price of fame.  How original!  There's an allegedly depressing moment towards the end of the film, but I wasn't shedding a single tear because I didn't care for any of the characters.  The dialogue is horrible.  The acting is way under par.Carey is cute and charming, with a smile to die for, but that can't overshadow her lack of acting skills.  And why in the hell did Vondie Curtis-Hall cast Max Beesley in the co-starring role?  I've never seen him in any other movies, but in this one he's terrible.  Not to mention that his attempt at a New York accent is the worst!  When I saw Erin Brockovich I wasn't aware that Albert Finney was English, before I saw him in an interview.  I was aware that Beesley was English, because during half the film he seems to forget that he's playing a New Yorker and starts talking in his normal accent!  Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful!  The only actors that added a hint of professionalism to the cast were Terence Howard (from The Best Man and Angel Eyes) and Dorian Harewood (from Full Metal Jacket and Sudden Death).  Howard doesn't have too many successful films under his belt, but he is an underrated talent and being one of the two good actors in this disaster makes him look like Brando.  And the same goes for Harewood, who actually does have a series of successful films under his belt.  Oh, yes, and I forgot to mention Tia Texada, who some may remember from Nurse Betty.  She is a talented actress who has real potential, and she's very beautiful.  She is also too good for this cast.  And what is Vondie Curtis-Hall doing, directing crap like this?  He happens to be a very talented actor, with great roles in films like Eve's Bayou, but he obviously needs pointers behind the camera.  With the exception of a few aerial shots, this could easily be mistaken for a TV movie.The movie is set in 1983, and I'm fascinated by the whole culture of the eighties, but even that eighties vibe couldn't spice things up.  There are some extremely heavy-handed, cheesy moments.  The way the plot is set up is Mariah is a backup singer for the wife of a big-time music producer--who also produces her music.  She is a terrible singer, whereas Mariah has the voice of a goddess, so he turns off his wife's microphone and basically just records Mariah's voice.  And in another scene, they're performing live and the same thing is done--her mike is turned off and just Mariah's voice is heard.  So nobody notices--including her--that everyone's hearing Mariah's voice, instead of the lead singer.  Take the corniest soap opera and add music--you have Glitter.Trust all the negative reviews!

My wife claims she rented the DVD to have fun watching a 'bad movie'. So, I was up for it and ready to give it a chance, thinking that maybe it got an unfair shake by the critics. Well, there was no fun to be had unless you count laughing at the bad dialogue, lack of characterization, cliche after cliche, comatose flatness of tone, and stylized editing that covers up bad pacing, etc.Blame the Director, Vondie Curtis-Hall, and whoever edited it. This is a career ending movie.For instance, the scene where 'Dice' and the Bad Guy Music Producer get up to go talk about freeing Billie (Mariah) from her contract -  Obviously, they had too far to walk to get to a quiet place in the same shot, it took too much time, so they just picked a couple of places during that walk to edit out 3 or 4 steps. Jump jump jump. Nowhere else in the movie is the action stylized in such a way. I laughed out loud! What a poorly planned shot and what an incredibly inept way to cover it up! Pathetically amateurish.For an extra treat, you should watch the DVD with the Director's Commentary on.

"},{"Title":"Mariah the friendly ghost","Date":"22 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  An OK movie. Some interesting points. First, Mariah seemed to try to present a more conservative image than she does in real life. There were several instances where her and her producer / boyfriend wanted to tone things down. In real life she lets it all hang out. In one of the horrible music videos on the DVD version, she kept grabbing herself and shaking it for the camera. I also have been paying a little attention to Mariah lately, apparently she had a nervous breakdown or something around the time this film was made. That was very unfortunate, however, I think she should bow down gracefully. I've seen her on several live TV award shows where it was obvious to me she's blown out her voice. Sounding very weak and thin, like she's damaged her vocal chords from singing improperly. Unable to go into moderately high ranges while before, her falsetto embellishments were astronomically high. The vocals in the film sounded fantastic, and I thought to myself OK, what happened- most of the stuff could have been older songs that she just had to lip sync to, but there where some sections where they couldn't do that. Did they use a lot of studio tricks to get her voice sounding good again? Apparently on the director commentary portion of the DVD he lets out the secret. He tries to downplay. He said something to the effect of   the vocals done on the film were by a Mariah sound alike. Mary Ann I forgot her last name. Mariah sang too but we didn't use any of her vocals. I didn't see any ghost singer noted in the credits. This was even more interesting because as part of the story line, Mariah supposedly ghosted for another singer who acted as if she was all that - meanwhile taking credit for Mariah's vocals. Could it have been Mary Ann Tatum who has sang backup on several Mariah CDs? Mary Ann however does do a fantastic job, and I'm sure there are a lot of unknown Mariahs in LA. Another interesting point is that the story was based in the '80's, when Millie Vanilli won a Grammy for best new artist, but then had it taken away when it was discovered that he was ghosting. Since this is kind of a negative review, I should mention that I have always been a big Mariah Carey fan, but Mariah, when you can't do it anymore- give it up. You've had such great success that you should leave it at that and don't diminish what you've achieved or embarrass yourself by trying to continue your career.

Even if you thought a film was poorly made, disturbing, graphic, horrible, or whatever, then at least the film made you care. Glitter pours out boredom in lethal doses. Director Vondie Curtis-Hall and cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson pull out a few visual tricks to add some punch to the lackluster affair, but the effort is not enough. The script can easily be seen as a reflection of Mariah Carey and her life. Carey, though, has no range (as an actress) at all. The scenes of romance with co-star Max Beesley fall totally flat. Plus, her moments of anger play like an actress trying to be mad, rather than a person who's actually angry. Carey, if she wanted to act, probably should have either taken a tiny role around veteran actors in another film. She's just not a great actress. The one bright spot though is her voice, which gets some use in a few songs, none of which are all that memorable. Acting problems aside, the film is one painfully boring movie. A 2 out of 10.

Myself, I've been saying Thank God I Found You to the creamy-skinned siren-voiced angel ever since the 1992 American Music Awards - but if you mentally replaced that description with annoying dolphin-voiced slattern, then this is definitely not for you.It was inevitable that Mariah would wend her way to the big screen Someday, given that most of her songs sound like they belong over end credit rolls anyway, that she's already covered Endless Love and Take A Look At Me Now (Against All Odds) and that she co-wrote Faith Hill's song for How The Grinch Stole Christmas with James Horner. (Mariah Carey and James Horner - a match made in end credit ballad heaven if ever there was one.) But what Emotions led her to feel this would be the pot of the gold at the end of the Rainbow, we can only speculate.Set in 1983, this isn't a biopic but it has more than a few echoes of Mariah's real life - born to black and white parents, discovered while singing backup, taken under the wing of a mentor who becomes her Loverboy, has a huge hit with her first single etc (at one point we see her visibly (and intentionally) uncomfortable in swimwear while shooting a video; admittedly she was less inclined to display flesh circa her 1990 breakthrough, but she's never seemed like the bashful type - compare this to her cameo in The Bachelor, where her opera singer chews out Chris O'Donnell by reminding him You look good without your shirt off, but then again so do I. That's my girl...). But it's a dramatic washout even without any comparison to her real (and far more compelling) problems, both professional and personal.Although this is basically a vanity vehicle - Mariah's company Maroon Entertainment produced the movie, no one in the story ever calls her a showoff, and in addition to her name appearing A LOT in the closing credits La Carey is also billed as executive music producer - it's not really Mariah's fault; Lena Horne she isn't, but she doesn't act any worse than, say, Robert Downey Jr sings. The real culprits are behind the camera; Kate Lanier's seemingly first draft screenplay is dramatically undernourished and seems to be allergic to unfamiliar situations and good dialogue, while Vondie Curtis-Hall's direction is too full of annoying NYPD Blue-type transitions and too empty of anything that actually brings some zip to the proceedings (which is bad in the performance scenes, which we'll get to later).The movie also has no feel for the early 80s - Mariah's character calls Max Beesley's DJ/producer a fly DJ; she spends 10 weeks at #1 with I Didn't Mean To Turn You On two or three years before Robert Palmer made it a hit; we hear Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Relax being played in a nightclub several months before the song even came out in BRITAIN, never mind America; and while Quincy Jones exists in this Fantasy world, Michael Jackson (whose current release at the time was a little something called Thriller) apparently doesn't. Appropriately enough given all the phoniness, a lot of the film was shot in Canada.Worst of all, as a showcase for its star it's drab. On records, in videos, on stage and even in interviews Mariah is often a Honey - fun, captivating and sex on a stick (Miss Carey's buns beat those of Jennifer Lopez any day, for starters) - although she gets plenty of chances to sing, her vocals sometimes seem like a Greek chorus (when her younger self (a good turn from Isabel Gomes) is taken away from her mother following a life-threatening incident at home, we hear her singing She was very fragile...). Other than a montage of her doing I Didn't Mean To Turn You On, it's not until her sold-out Madison Square Garden concert that the Mariah we know and love really arrives (even then, in addition to being literally too little and too late, this scene has already received TV exposure on The Box).***SPOILER ALERT...SPOILER ALERT*** This scene is one of the film's two climaxes, the other coming right afterwards when she's reunited with her long-lost mother. Unfortunately, like most of the rest of the movie this is so badly handled by writer Lanier that you and I Don't Wanna Cry, as does the death of a character close to our heroine (the climax of another poor subplot, about her ex-producer). Like I said, first draft. ***END OF SPOILER ALERT***Glitter isn't Jailhouse Rock by a long shot, but neither is it Under the Cherry Moon. But it's still one for fans only; although Mariah's videos give an idea of how fun it could have been, this is at least a proper movie (unlike Michael Jackson's Moonwalker), and we'll always have them and the end credits for The Prince of Egypt.Plus, I Still Believe that One Sweet Day the doe-eyed Heartbreaker that is Mariah Carey will make a movie that has audiences everywhere in Bliss.

Well, Glitter is exactly that type of film, it's an utterly pathetic and boring flick that will no doubt become one of the most bashed films of the year.  First off, I don't care how much this was based on Carey's real life, the movie wasn't the least bit interesting, the character development, plot and acting is second rate at best, though third rate might be a better description.  I'm not sure what the director and screenwriter were thinking when they decided to make it, but that's probably the problem, they didn't think. They figured that if they put Carey in the film, no matter how bad it was, that fans would go to see it. Well thankfully they didn't, the film only managed to make $2.5 mil. in it's opening weekend, (whoo-hoo), so maybe this will make Carey reconsider her film choices or just avoid films all together, since her acting is very poor and just plain irritating.

There were star vehicles before, depending for their drawing power mostly on the big name on the poster. But at least there was something else in them. Anything. Glitter is hollow on the inside, and on its surface it got nothing but Mariah Carey. Which is next to nothing considering the complete absence of acting skills this amazing singer presents here. Anything in this movie, from plot to script to setting to characters, is the product of one lame session of five-second brainstorming. Picking up every first line that came to their heads, the writers put together dialogue without any depth or meaning whatsoever, leaving some cardboard figures of characters behind even good actors couldn't have done anything with (not that there are any good actors in this one).  Blaming Glitter for its formality is almost an insult to all decently unimaginative movies, whose makers just couldn't think of anything better. With Glitter, no one even bothered to think.

Wandering through the film with one expression (eyes wide, mouth slightly agape -- one recalls Kathy Ireland's dull surprise during the MST3K screening of Alien from L.A.), Carey has zero screen presence. At times, she looks like a Muppet version of Kathie Lee Gifford, and her performance never indicates that her character is anything more than a straw being carried by the winds of the contrived plot.The one bright spot in this tacky mess Ann Magnuson as a hyped-up record label P.R. person. The movie is ostensibly set in 1983 New York nightclub circles (although there's not a single grain of cocaine in the movie), but the only person who looks like they're in the right decade is Magnuson, whose hair, clunky jewelry, and shoulder pads are absolutely right-on. (As a survivor of that era, she probably dug that stuff out of her own closet.)  She's also very funny and a real live wire, and easily walks away with the movie while everyone else is sleepwalking.Carey's high-pitched musical career will no doubt continue apace (after all, the dreadful Sincerely Yours didn't sink Liberace's stellar career), but I can only hope that she one day develops a sense of humor about this movie, since camp aficionados will no doubt be hosting midnight screenings of this doozy until the apocalypse. Just look for the drag queens with the inexplicable stripe of silver makeup on their biceps. (See the movie, and you'll know what I mean.)

"},{"Title":"Slow starting, but impressive and inspirational ending...","Date":"21 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  I recently had the pleasure of viewing this movie, Glitter, today. I honestly was not expecting too much. And throughout the first half an hour of this movie, it started to prove me right. Let me explain...Glitter happens to be Mariah Carey's first lead role as an actress. It was expected that the movie would receive harsh reviews due to many critics who dislike Carey, not only as a singer, but refuse to accept her as an actress. And although the actress Mariah does not even closely compare to the singer Mariah, she does one hell of a job. Other cast mates include Max Beesley who was good, but could have been a little more convincing and the hilarious duo of Da Brat and Tia Texada, who give the movie that extra bit of flava, so to speak.Mariah plays a bi-racial child, growing up with a single parent (sound familiar?), only this time, her mother is black and has a serious drug problem. Mariah's character, Billie Frank, is forced to leave her mother's side and grows up as an orphan while befriending two young girls, Louise and Roxanne (Da Brat and Tia Texada). The three grow up together as best friends and as time goes by and the movie flashes forward in time, they move on to new experiences with and without each other.Billie is soon recognized by D.J. Dice (Max Beeseley), in a club. Dice desperately tries to pursue Billie to let him produce her as he sees incredible talent within her voice. This part of the movie starts of slow. The scenes within the first forty-five minutes were somewhat choppy and they seemed too short. As if everything was happening all at once. I thought, this is it then. It was my first time seeing Mariah Carey as an actress and she didn't convince nor impress me. I couldn't help but see Billie as Mariah during the movie. She seemed like the same person to me.Then the movie continued on and I saw myself instantly getting into it. A love forms between the two and although I felt the script should have captured more of Billie and Dice's romantic moments, it seems to be realistic, giving you the feeling that this is a real-life story happening before your very eyes, rather than a movie. The two encounter a taste of fame as Billie starts to hit it big. The rest, I'd rather not give away. Let's just say that the plot thickened and pulled you in so tightly, it left you almost breathless at the end. With numerous problems and dangerous situations, Mariah starts to portray Billie as a whole new character, so unlike herself. Her acting improves and is way more impressive. She is convincing and inspirational as she tries to find herself, something she has been trying to do the day her mother left. The ending is a shocker and by the credits I was in tears. Not only by the occurrences that Billie faces, but the WAY Mariah plays Billie so passionately and gets into character. This movie definitely had a lot of potential.The music to Glitter fits in perfectly with its time. Mariah Carey's voice sounds better than ever and she even manages to sneak a few chills down your spine as you listen. But the movie is not all song. In fact, it's not all about a singer either. With lots of twists and turns, I felt Glitter held a promising message.I definitely recommend this movie to any Mariah Carey fan out there, however, for the people who dislike her, why even bother seeing it? I wish this movie had a better beginning, but I do feel the ending was worth it. Mariah Carey proves to be quite a talented young actress and I hope that in the future she is given the chance to broaden her skills and play a character the complete opposite of herself. I definitely think she can handle it. This movie was very inspirational and taught the audience many important values in life. All in all, this is a great film and to all who criticize this movie with little reason, it's quite obvious for your disregard towards Carey. I definitely feel that if Billie Frank was played by a nobody, the reviews would have been much better...not because someone else did a better acting job, but for the pure fact that the leading actress was not Mariah Carey herself.

And it is. Yes, the story is a familiar one. That's true for EVERY movie. Yes the cinematography sucks. That's true for a lot of movies. Sure, this is no Hard Day's Night. But it's got one of the best singers of all time singing some nice material. That ALONE makes Glitter worth watching. If you don't understand that, what the hell do you understand about movies? Three quarters of making a good movie is just putting a great performer in front of the camera. If you do that, you already have a watchable film, and Glitter has that, for sure. Mariah Carey's acting is amateurish, but it is genuine and emotional, and that's enough to hold the film's center. Carey's costars are all good, putting in performances that go well beyond perfunctory. They take poor material, in terms of writing, and they breath life into it. In particular, Max Beesley is a fine actor, sortof the poor man's Ewan McGregor, and there is a good chemistry between him and Carey. The themes of this movie are serious and the performers, if not the writers and producers, are serious about them; trying to find yourself and yet not lose yourself in the artistic struggle.Glitter's sin is that it could have been a much better movie. The production values are cheap and not in a good way. Writing and direction deflect Glitter's focus at key points in the development of characters and of the story. Carey herself has put her finger on the problem it was apparently decided to shoot for a younger audience, as in a 12 year old audience, and the result was half-baked. It's a shame and a disappointment, but Glitter is still a movie with considerable promise that delivers enough to be worth watching, worth having. The amount of hate this movie gets is just grotesque. I'm sorry, but there are lots and lots of worse movies. "},{"Title":"Dear Mariah Carey, You Rock!

I remember back in 2001 how Mariah Carey was trying to so hard to be on top of the world, have a record and movie reach number 1 in one year, but everyone knew this was a typical movie where a pop star should just really stick to their day job. I don't know why Mariah thought this was a good idea, it's just so typical. Now granted, I do believe this was a bad movie, but as far as bottom 100 goes... I don't think it was that extremely bad, it's better than most pop star trying to be a movie star movies like In the Cut. Glitter is just poorly written and has bad actors in it, that's what makes it so unbearable to watch and makes Mariah look incredibly desperate for everyone's approval.Billie Frank was put into a foster home as a child when her mother lost the house to a fire, Billie grows up and becomes a back up singer in a group. But when a local DJ, Dice, hears Billie's voice, he wants to get her to sing his songs and become a power house sensation in the music world. They engage in a romance together and everything seems to go well when she is finally exposed and then gets exploited. But of course it starts to get into the way of her and Dice's relationship and she begins to realize the pain and sacrifices she must make in order to make it big.Glitter is just a cheesy movie, it doesn't do any harm, that's the reason for the merciful rating I'm giving it. But I'm just really surprised by Terrence Howard who is an incredible actor and he did this crummy movie. But then again we have Al Pacino in Gigli, it's one of those scary stories of life where if the money is good, what the heck, let's get the big star in it. Mariah looked so uncomfortable on camera and did a horrible job of acting. I feel bad because I'm just complaining so much about this movie, but if you're looking for a cheesy movie, I'd recommend Glitter, but it's torture on the brain, it made mine hurt that's for sure when I thought of all the money that was wasted on this box office flop.2/10 "},{"Title":"Pointless and forgettable, but not uniquely horrid","Date":"25 August 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":" I rented this film hoping that it would be as ridiculous, over-the-top, and unintentionally hilarious as Vanilla Ice's Cool as Ice, the standard that I hold all movie stinkers against.I came away disappointed.

The actor who plays him, Max Beesley, is British, and at times his real accent would slip out underneath his inept attempt to talk like a Noo Yawker.I'm rating Glitter a 2 because I only reserve a 1 rating for sublimely horrible and unintentionally hilarious films like Cool as Ice, or utterly incoherent and ineptly done messes like Can't Stop the Music.Truly, sublimely bad films are worth your time and money for the perverse entertainment value, the same kind that you get from gawking at freaks on the Jerry Springer show.

Mariah Carey can't act at all, and there's nothing that a so-so supporting cast can do to help strengthen a predictable and uninspired script.Don't do it to yourself. If you're just a die-hard Mariah fan, get the soundtrack CD and save yourself some pain.

Occasionally a problem pops up, but then twenty minutes of music drive all worries about the problem away. The movie is supposed to be about the struggle of young singer Billy Frank's rise to greatness, but there is no struggle. Her amazing talents crush all that dare oppose her, destroying enemies with a single high note.Without conflict there is no movie.

Certainly there will be a superficial turning plot and a happy end. Actually it is a shallow and ridiculous plot, only to promote Mariah Carey as an actress. Her performance is something that deserves to be commented. In the past, Mariah Carey had a beautiful face. Get the VHS 'The First Vision', and you will see a gorgeous woman with brunet curled hair, natural eyebrows, nose and cheeks. Now, this female version of Michael Jackson is pathetic, with blond straight hair, thin nose and eyebrows and cheeks with silicone. Her acting is ridiculous, blinking all the time. When she is happy, she blinks. When she is sad, she blinks. When she is in love, she blinks. The number of times she blinks along this flick could be a reason for a funny game 'Guess how many times she will blink in such a period of the movie?' And even singing, she exaggerates with her 'uhs... uhs..' (as usual). The DJ Julian Dice (Max Beesley) looks like a clone of Mark Wahlberg. Maybe fans of Mariah Carey may like this movie, but I am not his fan.

I've seen plenty of stinkers, particularly because I like them just as much as good movies. Still, this film isn't as horrid as people say, but man, does this film have some serious problems.Mariah's acting, to be honest, is terrible. She performs as if she's half asleep and mumbles her lines in an incoherent fashion. Her distinctive New York/Black American accent sounds the same no matter what emotion (ironic since she sang a song called Emotion) she's portraying. Even more frightening is her look; Mariah looks like some freakish alien. I used to think in the early 90's that she was very beautiful; she looks awful about 75% of the time here. Those eyebrows! Those high cheekbones!The costumes in this movie are also brutal. Mariah and Da Brat wears clothes that makes the ones The Young And The Restless' Michelle Stafford wear look good. Most of her outfits don't scream 1983. And yes, she wears some pretty revealing outfits to show off that superb figure. Too bad about her face...The overall acting is awful, but the script is worse. It's boring, filled with cliches and painfully lame dialogue and the actors don't make any effort to rise above the script. No one here delivers a great performance. Vondie Curtis-Hall, the director of this flop, proved his worth with the superb Tupac Shakur-Tim Roth-Thandie Newton film Gridlock'd; he was quite rusty for this one. Or perhaps he had no choice but to make do with the fact that his star was going through some extremely erratic behavior.The story is filled with holes and it seems as she becomes more of an overall success overnight than an eventual one. Billie Frank seems to do very little to reach stardom. I wish it was that easy.For those hoping that this film has some of that so bad it's funny dialogue, there is some. The scene where Billie and Dice are at the restaurant and Dice is introducing her to escargot was hilarious. Her deadpan sleepwalk talking here was hilarious. Her performance reminded me of Carre Otis from Wild Orchid, where most of her lines are three word sentences.Still, I can see why this movie bombed, not even making the Top 10 in its first week. Mariah's and company's horrid acting, the terrible script, and the hackneyed plot spelled disaster for this one. Still, I wouldn't consider it the worst film ever made; there's much worse than this.

Awful it was. We follow the very ordinary and pathetic path of a young woman who suddenly becomes a superstar. Wow! How original! I heard that even though Mariah is playing a fictional character, the story is inspired by Mariah's career. I guess she just added some semi-dramatic (as we are trying not to laugh when something bad happens to her) elements in the story to make it an even bigger cliche collection.   There are no SO ridiculous or absurd parts in this film, because it stays very simple (and I don't think anyone from this film has the IQ to go for something more complex), but it really simply sucks. There are many scenes where the director clumsily put occasions for Mariah to show her supposedly amazing voice.  I guess that gave Mariah a reason to release a new album and make more money (and also get fired from her label HA HA!). When you get to the rolling credits, you just can't understand how the film could last one hour and forty minutes and leave you with the impression that you slept for one hour and forty minutes, even if you didn't.  This film is empty. Period.  With some awful acting from Mariah Carey, who should first stop acting and second stop singing, you are left with the impossible belief that they took her as the lead actress.  She never sounds natural, she will get on your nerves with her shallow acting when she tries to demonstrate feelings other than simply smiling like an idiot like she does all the time on MTV.  I know that may sound very mean, but it really leaves you that impression, especially if you don't really like pop music/movies.  As an actress, she has no charisma, physically (I really don't think this woman is attractive at all) and she simply doesn't have a believable enough psychological aspect in her character to mention it.  She is not the only bad actress in Glitter, there's also the boyfriend.  He's not EXTREMELY bad, but noticeably.  The mother is also pretty awful, and the black guy that is some kind of gangster is one of the worst.   The directing is conventional, it has nothing special, nothing good, nothing bad, except for the fact that it gives a product entitled Glitter.  That's all I had to say for the directing.  Overall, Glitter is, without being the worst thing I've seen in my life, a very pathetic piece of cinema and a very meaningful failure for Mariah Carey.  Shallow, narcissistic, cliche, stupidly dramatic, badly acted, with average directing, Glitter is, in the purest meaning of the word, a WASTE of time.It didn't glitter that much on the Box-Office, didn't it Mariah?

But I thought perhaps the magnitude of its stupidity had been exaggerated, and with the same impulse that leads many people to stop and watch a car crash, I rented this movie. What I found was perhaps the most annoying piece of fluff ever created by the media industry. This film has no solid plot or premise. The holes in the story are big enough to swallow the Grand Canyon. I found myself waiting for some kind of purpose to emerge as the movie progressed. I was monumentally disappointed. The movie is either so complex that I as a normal person cannot grasp the symbolism or so horribly shallow that only the feeblest of minds could see any point to this drivel disguised as a movie. I believe unfortunately it is the latter rather than the former. There are many aspects that make this film weak.  Let us be honest. To say Mariah Carey is not the greatest actor in the world would be the understatement of the century, but this film's lack of substance does not solely rest on her slender shoulders. A cast of B-list actors who could not act their way through a wet paper bag also add to this failure. In addition are bad writing and plot. There was not one piece of original, inventive material in the whole movie. The whole film seems to revolve around Mariah Carey's appearance. Every other second she is gyrating around in some skimpy ensemble. The success of the film was largely tied to Mariah Carey's cleavage. This approach might have worked if it were a concert special or if the character weren't so two-dimensional and aggravating. The movie is reminiscent of Elvis films of the 50's and 60's in which the music is based around the charisma of a popular performer, but honestly Mariah Carey is no Elvis.

Bad ACTING lovers on the other hand will be jumping for joy and awaiting, with baited breath, every single syllable that is allowed to escape form the film's star Mariah Carey.Carey is so unbelievably, outrageously terrible in conveying even the slightest of emotions throughout the entire running time of Glitter that watching her performance is at the same time both fascinating and deadly boring.  I'm really not sure if Ms. Carey's marionetted corpse could have put less intensity into this role.  Every smile looks forced, every motion wooden, and everytime a tear is to be shed, Mariah resembles a mannequin wetted conservatively with Visine.  This is, to be sure, one of the worst leading perfomances in motion picture history.Overall, Glitter must be cherished forever as a sterling example of what can, and will go wrong when a diva like Carey is given free-range to create her own film with no one allowed to reign her in.

Of course, if all Curtis-Hall had to offer was eye candy and visual dazzle, no one would pay attention.  However, he scathingly critiques the 80s pop music scene with such savagery that audiences will certainly be moved in ways not seen since Last Tango in Paris.  This is not some film warped in sentimental sap (i.e. Casablanca, Vertigo) but a cinematic triumph with deep, complex emotional reverberations.  A film that actually SAYS something.  And in the days of such banal Hollywood tripe as You Can Count On Me and Memento, that's certainly welcome.Kudos should go out to its unknown lead, Mariah Carey, for delivering what is ultimately the finest screen portrayal of a pop star in ages.  Carey sings with so much feeling and power that she could possibly have a second career as a pop star herself.  However, with the acting chops she shows in full force here, she shouldn't need worry about a second career.  It may be the most startling female performance since Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice.

None of it helps.Nor is Mariah the only miscreant. The screenplay omits certain key data, such as showing us how she gets to be a star. Once she is a star, she still seems to exist in the same world -- there are no handlers, no bodyguards, and she freely walks the streets of Manhattan with no one asking her for an autograph. Vondie Curtis-Hall's direction is full of silly transitions, and leading man Max Beesley, sporting a fake-beard of a New York accent, has the appeal of a boll weevil. The only fun performance (in the right way) comes from Ann Magnusson, as a voracious talent manager. The role's a cliche, but at least she has energy.I had a good time giggling at this movie's multitude of ineptitudes, but I won't need to see it again.

Mariah Carry didn't have much to do with the failure of this movie, it was dead and buried long before she signed on. There were enormous leaps of inconsistency and a storyline about as interesting econ professor recounting his decision to enter the field. Which is appropriate because it seemed the only purpose to this movie was the use of Carry's name to make a buck. It was a painting by numbers style of movie-making, they may as well have substituted Lance  Armstrong and switch the mushy 90's R&B with bicycle racing, or better yet,  some child actor like Elizabeth Berkley playing a character motivated by dreams of stripping in Las Vegas - wait, didn't they do that already?

The styling and costumes were perfect. The actress playing `young Mariah' was a dreamy little doll. Terrence Dashon Howard was excellent as always in his `bad guy' roles. Da Brat was also surprisingly fun to watch. I'm not so sure about some of the other supporting cast...may have been a missed opportunity or two.

I'm sure she's a great person once you get to know her, but Glitter has got to be the most f**king ridiculous movie I've ever seen.Come on!!!  Who at 20th Century Fox green-lighted this turd?  This flick sets new standards for film incompetence.  The acting (what little of it there is) falls to capture any genuine emotion, and the script offers us nothing in the way of believable characters or dialogue (not to mention the occasional plot absurdity - you'll know them when you see them)  Director Vondie Curtis-Hall tries to give the movie some glossy production value, perhaps to take your mind off the fact that Mariah can't act, but he fails, allowing editor Jeff Freeman to go insane in his use of aerial shots of NY (including a shot of the WTC towers, which will probably be the only thing in this flick that will generate any honest reaction from the audience) and some bizarre editing in certain scenes that I suppose was done to give the movie some style.  Oops!  That didn't work!What else is there to say about this flick?  I knew walking in that this was going to be a bad movie.  That's why I got a couple of drinks before the movie to enhance my Mariah experience, but this movie pulled the rug out from under me.  It was actually worse than I thought it would be.

And even when she was suppose to be a poor street girl she looked like she had just stepped off the cover of a magazine. Mariah's real life and movie buddy Shawntae Da Brat Harris was wasted as the frumpy friend. Her bubbly personality has been wasted over and over again in small roles (Kazaam, Parenthood) and Glitter is no exception.  So even though Da Brat was more Louise than Mariah was Billie, I wasn't satisfied. Though I'm no longer into Da Brat's music, I always thought she lit up the screen. But back to our main character - she seems like she's trying to act half the time and never quite pulls off the homegirl look. She remains Mariah Carey the whole time and never becomes Billie. Her boyfriend annoyed me from the begining and I didn't really feel she felt his unfortunate fate (I want spoil you, even if the film was crap). Our vilian (a rival producer) was just a gangster who did music. And the Billie's publiscists (who were supoose to be comical) fell flat. Basically, I left the theater wanting my money back.

I'm surprised that Blockbuster isn't selling it for £0.01p The movie is supposed to take place in 1983 but the plot is so predictable you know what's going to happen after watching the opening credits. Billie Frank abandoned by her mother and sent to a group home is going to grow up and MAKE IT BIG. On this journey down the yellow brick road to the riches her manager Dice, two group home buddies and a cat that replaces Toto. Sadly the cat is smart enough to split halfway through this nightmare of a film and not come back until near the final act. If only I were as lucky as he is.The film is a 24 carat vanity project just like Spice World, Crossroads, Gigli and In The Mix etc.... This type vehicle is not for actors nor discovering acting ability - its more a stand, pose in an outfit, smile and lip sync your way through the horrible script. It's wrong. It's a crime. And it should be banned.And eventually Mariah Carey ended up not with Glitter in her eyes, but with tears. Thankfully for her she's managed to resurrect her career with that We Belong Together song but the scars are still there.Overall, Glitter is a pathetic piece of cinema and a very meaningful failure for Mariah Carey.

They are the hilarious ghetto girls that are best friends with Billie (Mariah). Each scene with them is sparkling and Mariah actually looks more comfortable with them than with any of the other actors.What other things sparkle in this movie? Well at times Mariah does. She looks amazing in the 80's and the first scene when she's shakin' her ass to Lime's Babe, I'm Gonna Love Tonight and then Blondie's Heart of Glass is a highlight. Padma Lakshmi was deliciously visceral as the pretty Sylk and Timothy Walker may have been a stereotype role of hot young producer but he does do an up to par job. The setting, the way the camera moved is so different in this movie. It takes me to my next definition of glitter.2.Brilliant or showy, often superficial attractiveness.This is what it was when Billie first sets eyes on DJ Julian Dice (Max Beesley) eveything stops and slow motion kicks in. The scenes over New York looked stunning. Everything screamed 1980's New York and club bohemia. If only this movie stayed in the clubs rather than it completely going off the rails into a fantastic fairytale. Our heroine Billie was at her most comfortable in the clubs. Mariah looked relaxed there. It was vibrant, exciting with so many references to the music scene, disco, dance, rock and early hip hop. After that it kind of just went downhill. The only thing that redeemed it after Billie took out of the clubs was the video director and her publicist. One thing I noticed there were a lot of Mariah Carey related jokes (Show me of her breasts).3. Small pieces of light-reflecting decorative material. The soundtrack was I guess Bangin! if anybody appreciates nostalgic music from the 80s you will love this movie. So many obscure tracks so many new tracks freestyles and dance routines it is just striking. Another piece of light is a scene Mariah had to fight to keep in the movie as the director tells us on the commentary. It portrays a solid peformance by Valerie Pettiford as Lillie with her child Billie using he to get money of her father. Her bi-racial background wasn't continued after that. It was a shame It could have really gone places the next time you see the mother is at the end in a surprising twist.The movie doesn't deserve the rep it got. it fully defines Glitter and so what did you expect.

Da Brat & Tia Texada (Playing Billie's childhood friends) mostly helped the funny part of the film, Max Beesley (as Billie's love interest) - the romantic/dramatic part and even gorgeous Eric Benet with a cameo appearance did a fairly nice job. All in all, the movie is short, fun and even has a surprising ending! The music that goes along with it is an extremely big part of it and I feel bad for the reporters who dislike Carey's music and for that chose to dismiss the whole movie. I suggest you give Glitter a try and ignore the joke that was made out of it, because it is honestly much better. One last advice, Don't back down Mariah, you have what it takes!

I guess she must have watched it.  The timeline of the movie is so poorly done that we never get a sense of where Billie/Mariah is on her way up.  She's got a record deal and rides around in limos within a few minutes of the opening credits, yet near the end of the movie we see her shlepping her own groceries home; she's a big star who walks the streets of New York (no danger of forgetting that--there's a shot of the Empire State Building every 10 minutes) half-naked without attracting any fan attention at all.  Not only that, she still shops at K-Mart.  The mugging that passes for acting is disgraceful.  Poor Mariah can hardly get the ear-to-ear monkey grin off her face.  We always know when somebody's dead or in danger because the big grin disappears, to be replaced by a little downturned mouth and rapid blinking.  You've got to feel sorry for her.  Who did this to her?  And the worst thing of all was the lost-mother subplot.  Let me get this straight the woman couldn't even get a minimum-wage job in order to hold on to her precious daughter??  Give me a break.  And then when Billie becomes a big enough star to sell out Madison Square Garden it fails to attract the attention of her mother.  She leaves her concert and has her limo driver haul her halfway across the country to meet up with the mother she hasn't seen in years.  Did Dice actually write the exact address on his farewell note?  Why didn't she have the limo driver swing by her apartment so she could change out of her see-through gown?  Somehow she managed to get the eye make-up off in the overnight trip.  Now let's tramp across the grass in the bucolic setting and have June Cleaver come out of the house for a big hug.

The DP for some reason every once in awhile uses jump cuts which look ridiculous and arent done with true style. He also uses really awful eyeline matches.

The fatal flaw of this movie is that it attempted to come across as serious and dramatic.  That's why I have to agree with one of the earlier posts that you can't blame Mariah Carey.  It easily could've been a blockbuster parody on the level with Scarey Movie.  I really feel Mariah would've been the ideal choice for this as a comedy where she would've had lots of room to poke fun at herself and her diva status.  There were so many moments where I burst out laughing as I'm sure the select few who actually saw this in theatres did.  The expression on Mariah's cat surely must've had those who caught it rolling in the asiles.  The cat looked as lost and confused as Mariah in this train wreck.  Practically every scene with Da Brat was priceless especially her getting kicked out of the limo in what looked like pajamas.

The viewer can actually see when Mariah is thinking Okay, I have to act sad in this scene and so on.  I was thoroughly disappointed that although it was supposedly set in the 80s, there was not one single mullet in the entire film - the love interest had a hair style that was more late 90s than anything - and Mariah is clothed in the most unflattering attire throughout the movie.  They kept making her wear her hair in a side pony tail, which gave her a pained expression, and she had this weird silver streak of make up that moved from her left shoulder to her decolletage to her right arm, and even onto her lower back.  What's with that?  Maybe it's some pop culture reference that I completely missed, I don't know.But all these flaws could be forgiven if there was a semblance of a plot.  But there wasn't.  Even though I'd been watching the clock after the first fifteen minutes, when the film actually ended, it was completely abrupt.

The soundtrack was pretty good for the kids. Which I was in High School at the time. Overall, I remember the plot just being really bad. Even with Mariah Carey being the main star. In fact, it almost seemed like a bad parody of Mariah Carey's life. I was shocked that she allowed this. I just remember the crazy/drunk MTV strip tease, and that's pretty much how this movie was. It's really just a marketing tool for Mariah Carey. I'm a fan,but not that big of fan. I'd only watch this if you were absolutely bored out of your mind. Otherwise, there's nothing interesting about this movie to watch. Tennessee was a much better production, and plot to see Mariah in.

What an atrocity.If the insipid script and trite plot don't get you, then the flat acting and stereotyped characters (including Mariah's) will; and if you can stomach both of those, the photography will.There is one decent line in the movie when Mariah first encounters escargots, she says, someone went all the way to France for this? Not bad, but a single line does not make up for the banal dialogue or the tired girl gets everything but loses her soul plot line. Even the sex scene looks like something out of a soap opera.As to the direction, the less said, the better. I've seen home movies where more care and thought was given to the composition. When artsiness intrudes, it is annoying and distracting (such as in the transitions. Not standard dissolves or fades, but intrusive helicopter shots of Manhattan. Other annoying tricks of cinematography a few bits of slow motion for key moments; the digital distortion of the background in one shot). Finally, a bit about the music. Other than the closing credits, I don't think there was one full-length song by Ms Carey. Plenty of snippets, of course, but no actual songs. In other words, you can't even call this a musical.

When I saw a photo of Carey teeing off while wearing hot pants and porn-star high heels, I thought, 'This is a girl with not a lepton of virtue or admirability.' Well, okay, she can hit impressively high notes, but that's the only thing. So, when I started a Rifftrax membership and saw that this movie was among those riffed, I thought, 'Well, maybe.' I could only watch the first 20 minutes when I suddenly remembered that the drain in the garage needed mucking and decided that would be more fun and rewarding than watching this piece of schlock.I'm going to jump genres and compare this movie with 'Rock Star', a film similar in its rags-to-riches theme. At least 'Rock Star' had a comedic slant to it and didn't try to pass itself off as high drama. Those involved in making this film took it so seriously that it becomes a mockery in an attempt at gravity. They go to pains to show that Carey had a drunk mom, when to an orphanage but never expanded on those formative events or years. It may have been interesting to have seen the character pass through her formative years and how she became the person she is, how her values and beliefs were established, how the foundation for her adult life was laid. Nah! That's not important in a pseudo-biographical film. Let's jump right to the bootie-shaking. The songs even draw from a well of sophomoric offerings that Carey has penned.This is a long way to a short point. This movie just sucked.

I liked the fact that the only things I knew about this, was the cover with Mariah covered with, well, glitter and that it was (obviously) about a singer. I had never seen a preview, read a review or knew anything about the plot. So despite everyone's opinion &#x96; since 2001, I came in with a clean slate. And that was refreshing.No, the movie wasn't refreshing; it was deafening. I was referring to the open-mind going in.Billie (Mariah Carey) is a star born from her alcoholic mother on stage. Not shy at all, the little Billie sings her heart out. A star is born? Not so fast; we need some foreshadowing to mother falling asleep with a cigarette in tow nearly killing both mother and daughter. Off the daughter goes to foster care. She meets two friends&#x85;Man, I'm bored just recapping this melodramatic, Lifetime reject.Let's just skip to the rest of the ho-hum parts. She grows, dances for an early 1980's crowd, insert drama, gets discovered by two men, both of which use her, more drama here, and she rises to the top, ensuring even more drama.I can't say I hated this movie. It just wasn't good at all. Namely for the absolutely no-talent (in acting) Carey. Sure, she has a voice, but only a mother would love&#x85;to hear exclusively on the radio. I have never, ever in my movie-going experience seen so many fake smiles or so little emotion. Poor Billie (the character) as Carey has played her so&#x85;plain&#x85;that, quite frankly, I can't see anyone wanting to, or caring if either the character or actress succeeded or not. I knew she would, duh, the movie was as predictable as a Presidential race, but I found how little interest I had in watching her mope her way to the top.Have I failed to mention the incredibly idiotic, bargain-bin music video cinematography and the endless aerial NYC shots? How about the other thoroughly uninteresting stereotypes around her? Well, to sum that last part up, think of every single actor in this film and they fit that bill. I just felt embarrassed for them.Did Carey do this for a self-promotion? Did she think her smile was enough? (Oh, and by the way, she's not pretty. I'll just be mean for a second; she's not attractive nor were those HIDEOUS clothes.) I can barely see a three year old smile her way to warming another person's soul, much less than this wannabe actress do it &#x96; what, 87 times in this film? Did anyone watch these scenes while shot or bother to screen the film before it severely flopped at the box office? Seriously, how can one human being sit alone in an isolated screening room, watch this movie from beginning to end and say, Yep, we done have gold fer this Glitter! Make billions, we sure darn will! (Please tell me they fired this person, or better yet, let them drive one of the recalled Toyotas around Mulholland Dr. In a rainstorm. At 3AM. Without headlights. Having a seatbelt-less Carey in the passenger seat.) Though it now ranks in my own personal list of worst movies, I wouldn't put it at the top. It's just so incredibly boring, has so little emotion, that whenever a special Lifetime moment occurs, I could honestly care less what happened to who. If you can find the drunk 5-min Carey clip online when she accepts an award for her superior performance in 2009's Precious, it's more entertaining than the entire 104 minutes of Glitter.Ah heck, here is the link http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=sleaSKmd5Js. If this link is broken in the future, then a quick Google search Drunk Carey Award should do the trick. Save yourself the 99 minutes, and watch this instead. You'll get a heck of a lot of more emotion from her in real life than her so-called acting.

It's a penalty where the opposing team stops the runner and after the play is blown dead, opposing players keep jumping on the guy with ball--a definite no-no. Well, to me, this film conjures up this term, as when the film came out, reviewers seemed to come out of the woodwork to say how terrible the film was. In fact, they took great delight in talking about how bad the film was--shortly after release it was already legendary--perhaps made more so by Mariah Carey's nervous breakdown. Many speculated that this film led to this. Well, while I'd never say this is a good film, it certainly wasn't as bad as they said and it seemed that people were just piling on poor Mariah. Now I am NOT a fan of her music--up until this film, I barely ever heard any of it, but I felt bad for her because of all the hubbub.As I said, the film isn't good but it isn't terrible. The biggest problems were with the script--which was essentially A STAR IS BORN. The film had already been made too many times by the time Barbra Streisand did it a few decades ago--now, the story is so old and has been done so many times that it just seemed like a giant cliché. In many ways, also, Mariah's character seemed a bit like a battered woman and it felt frustrating that she kept holding on to a guy who was an obvious jerk--making her character seem a bit pathetic. Additionally, the film suffered, at least for me, with a severe case of music video-itis. In other words, there were so many musical numbers, at times it seemed more like a bunch of music videos strung together with a bare plot--not a real film. Of course, there have been much worse examples of this type of film--such as Paul McCartney's GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET--which had significantly less plot than GLITTER (yes, it is possible).But, on the positive side, Ms. Carey sure can sing and was absolutely beautiful--in fact, stunning. Also, her acting (which took a lot of abuse) wasn't that bad, either. In fact, had this film gone over a bit better, I could have seen her going on to other acting projects and improving her craft. Now, however, I don't think there's a chance in a billion! So, my overall verdict is that this is an okay film at best. However, it did not deserve all the attention the Razzies gave it--it's not really a movie that is enjoyably bad...just a bit dull and very predictable. However, if you adore her music, you could do a lot worse than see this film.Poor Mariah. After this film tanked, all she had was her immense fortune and jet-set life.

But this film, ironically and of course, coincidentally marked her epic fail of the album of the same title.The whole film was just like a amusing fakery, where you could see MC's sugar-sweet smiles when she's happy and her unconvincing tears when she's down. And those moments were probably the only ones where acting existed. Apart from those, there's no even acting to talk about. And that's the biggest issue for the film she sang it through instead of acting it through. Sometimes MC sang a song, and her BF held her from behind with no other reason.As for the story, it's plain boring, while we knew that Mariah had a painful childhood and a Cinderella legend when she was discovered by Sony records. These parts being added would definitely double the decency of this film up. Thus it's confusing why they didn't do it.The only good part was MC's skilled singing perhaps. And despite that, the songs sucked like hell, so it was funny that they imagined that those songs built up Billie's legendary career, which was mocking.

Dull, pointless, mildly annoying.This movie is so devoid of ANYTHING, it isn't the embarrassment to Carey's career so many of us had hoped it would be. It's a paperweight. It's just something sitting there that you step over. At least we can get some satisfaction out of the fact that the movie tanked at the box office.Mariah's seemingly bottomless ego and bewildering appeal have faded somewhat in the years since GLITTER's release.

Her acting is far superior than some of her peers such as Britney, Whitney, and Madonna. As far as her subdued, passive demeanor in the film, I feel it was in keeping with her character An abandoned lonely child carrying those wounds into adulthood. The plot made sense, and I also enjoyed her romance with Julian Dice Black. Their chemistry was believable and there were many bittersweet, poignant scenes where Dice saw the real girl and her pain. The fact that he is shot near the end really saddened me, especially since we were not able to see how far their relationship could go. Such as, though his love for Billy was genuine, could he have gotten over his jealousy of her success (which he believed in and helped to create)? Especially when he was feeling the pressure of failure in his own eyes? His drum and piano riffs were awesome. He must be a true musician in the real world. In the States, Max Beasley (Dice) is not well known, but he is a big star in his homeland, the UK.I really enjoyed this movie even though I do not own one Mariah CD.

Her acting was not perfect, but she put effort in, and it's not her fault she sings better than she acts.  In my eyes Mariah is always cool. I enjoyed the movie, and the album is good.  If someone asked me if I would recommend it to them, I would probably tell them to wait until it is on video. Basically, I don't think the movie is as well-made as some. But, I DO NOT think that Mariah, or the movie, deserve all the bashing.

The plot, in and of itself, isn't terrible and could've been more credible, but when you hand over the project with someone like Carey, it doesn't work because we think the story is like her life, but it isn't.  I didn't like the movie, it had scenes that were present, but they sometimes don't go anywhere.  Not much insight, not much to consider good moviemaking, and basically an excuse for Carey to strut her body (not a bad excuse, to be sure, but it's destracting as well).

When I first watched this movie on the TV, I was very curious, because I searched on the net and many people said it was awful, but a great amount of people said as well that it was fantastic, and it was! The beginning is so deep and the entire development of the movie don't let us leave without watching the end. Some people may find it obvious, but I've never thought that Glitter ended like that. And it transmitted me a great message. Don't take anybody for granted, and keep the faith, however is your situation. Believe, your dreams will come true. My heart is warmer every time I finish watching it. 5 stars to the music. It's EXCELLENT, the soundtrack is amazing, and I love its ballads, are so beautiful and classic... It reveals a lot of the pressure, pain and love that Billie Frank feels. The up-tempo songs are fantabolous, as well. Every time this movie is broadcast on television, I don't dare to miss it.

The woman. The singer. The pop-tart(like the pun? You know, Pop as in pop music, and tart, as in... eh, forget it). Her face is attractive, her body is desirable, her smile is blinding and her voice is annoying, loud and reminds me of sonar, or dog whistles. She's made a name for herself, in music, making plenty of money and gaining popularity. That's fine. As long as she doesn't force the music down our throats(or rather, into our ears), I'm fine with that. Then she had to go and make a movie... now, I'm one who believes very much in tolerating everyone. We all have to be here, and we can't all do or like the same things. But when you make such a bad movie... I'm speechless. Seriously. Whoever thought up the idea for this Mariah Carey-vehicle should be issued a restraining order; stay at least five hundred yards away from movie-making at all times. The director(who's apparently only done forgettable projects in the past, as well) should be fined for putting such a thing on film. The editor, or whoever else was behind the fast stylish cuts... should be forced to take a film class(which, I suspect, would be the person's first ever). The plot is ridiculous and uninteresting(but, then again, this is based on Mariah Carey's life, so what should one expect?). The pacing is bad. The acting is really, really bad. Carey acts worse than she sings, and anyone who's heard her voice knows exactly what that means. The characters are poorly written and one-dimensional. The dialog is so bad that it's almost painful to listen to... it's almost as bad as Carey's singing. The film is just so poorly done in every thinkable, conceivable way. Only die-hard Mariah Carey fans should spend time and/or money on this mess. Oh, and in case you hadn't noticed or were wondering; yes, I hate Mariah Carey. So I may or may not be biased against this movie... but I hate Ja Rule and Leslie Nielsen as well, and they had semi-big parts in Scary Movie 3, and that I enjoyed immensely. This one just had nothing to offer at all. I recommend it exclusively to big fans of Mariah Carey.

With its very low rating (currently #13 in the bottom 100) I was hoping to have the guilty pleasure of watching one of the all-time worst movies. But it wasn't nearly that bad. In fact, in places it was pretty entertaining.  I ended up giving it a 5 of 10, the same rating that I coincidentally gave to Britney Spears' Crossroads.  I think the 18% of 10 ratings and the 60% of 1 ratings given to this film are equally bogus.I've been a Mariah Carey fan since her first record came out. I think she is a cutie pie and I love her singing. While she won't give much competition as an actress to Meryl Streep, she actually emoted a couple of times, but she is best when flashing that broad smile or pretending that she is writing a new song, situations most natural to her.  It is her presence that brings this film up to 5 for me.I saw it on widescreen DVD (fullscreen on side 2) and in Dolby 5.1 sound. The picture is mainly good and the surround sound is excellent. The final concert number was like being there. The extras are modest, and there is a director's commentary that I did not listen to, and brief talent profiles plus a trailer. some SPOILERS follow, you may not want to read further if you have not yet seen Glitter.  To me the first 5 minutes, with Billie as a child in the smoky dive with her mother, singing the first time, and the last 5 minutes, years later when the successful Billie finds her mother again, clean and sober in Maryland, are the very best parts of the movie.  In between, the story is told in a very choppy manner. There's not much character development, and there's not much continuity from scene to scene. We rarely learn the motive behind what's happening.  For example, the orphanage which must have been a very important part of Billie's life, comes and goes in one very quick scene with dialog hardly worth saying, then Billie is grown up, dancing in a disco club.  It would have been a better movie if fewer elements had been chosen, and each developed a bit more fully.In fact, dialog is very weak throughout the whole film. At one point, when Billie is one of three backup signers and is about to be discovered, the a photographer wants to photograph the main singer and the backups, but is told loudly, You don't need them, they don't matter, they're just backup.  While the main singer may think that, the comment just didn't fit. Later, when Billie and her boyfriend producer met with some record company brass to seal a deal, there was a toast of champagne and a brief bit of cheesy dialog, nothing fitting the significance of that situation. And the first time she goes to Dice's apartment, he says Only 5 minutes. She says, How about 3 minutes, then shortly they are taking off each others' clothes. Not particularly good writing.So, in summary, Glitter is not a very well made film, marginal acting, cheesy dialog, not much flow to the story. That credit must be given to Kate Lanier who hasn't written anything of note yet. Critic Ebert who rates it 2 of 4 stars has a very accurate review. Overall it can be entertaining for a Mariah Carey fan and is better than its rating of #13 in the bottom 100 would indicate.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it!!  -) "},{"Title":"Why Do People Bash This Movie?","Date":"2 February 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  This was not the best movie ever.

She not only uses it well in this film, but has a supporting cast of performers that are musically impressive as well. She gives us lots of eye candy and the story is entertaining enough.  The film is well made technically.  Her acting skills are not of the same fine tuned precision that her voice is, but she gave it a good go.

I was thoroughly entertained. And if you appreciate Mariah's music and her lovely body, then I think you will enjoy how it's packaged in this film.  For Pete's sake I was surprised that Nicole Kidman could sing, but she wasn't that great. Her character was cold and hard to love. Mariah projected a sense of a genuine, caring girl that you could feel for.  Why is Nicole getting so much praise and Mariah so much flack? Give me a break.

To encourage some kind of reaction the mother calls upon her daughter to sing with her. The bashful girl wanders to the stage, takes the mike, and sing. This is the opening to Glitter, a movie that simply sparkles.From a very promising opening scene, you somewhat get the feeling that Glitter is on its way to becoming a new type of film. The opening scene is tinted, and grim, but still comes off as beautiful and refreshing.Singer/songwriter Mariah Carey helms this film and insists that this is not an autobiography. Thank God. The life of Billie Frank is sad and disillusioned. After being abandon by her jazz singer mother (Valerie Pettiford), the adult Billie (Carey) is unsure of herself. Everyone she knows, from her two best friends (Tia Texada and rapper DaBrat) to a pimplike producer (Terrance Howard) knows she can sing, but Bille doesn't really know her true potential.Enters DJ Julian Dice (Max Beesley) who not only tells Billie that she can sing, but guides her on her path to securing a record deal.But the path is unsteady.Beesley's character is the shakespearian tragic hero with the most problems and most lines. Carey's character seems restraint, as if screenwriter was unsure of Carey's true potential.Carey is a fine actress, with a remarkable screen presence that sparkles from beginning to end. Her problem is the few lines she is given to spat out that ranges from bland to Hallmarkish (You were the only one to believe in me, exclaims Billie is one scene). But the cliched script is overshadowed with a great supporting cast and beautiful scenery.The movie's best moments involves Carey main talent - her vocal prowless and passionate songwriting amidst a triumphant soundtrack. The opening song (Lillian Blue sung by Pettiford and newcomer Isabel Gomes who portrays the younger Billie) is simply beautiful and watching Carey unabashedly singing Reflections in one scene, is truly worth the admission itself.Director Vondie Curtis Hall does an admiral job with his direction; some scenes are close to ground breaking, and the shots of the world Trade Center is a somber and poignant reminder of its lost beauty.Glitter sparkles with a supporting cast, superb soundtrack, and a star that can now add actress to her ever-growing resume.

No offense to Julia Roberts because I really like her, but she better move over & make room for Mariah!I hope we all see more of Mariah on the big screen in the future. I can't even say enough about how much I loved this movie! I would go again & again & again to see it. I can't wait for video. Mariah is so beautiful. Every angle the camera got Mariah at turned out perfect. She truly radiated a glittery glow. I think Mariah is the camera's best friend. She is truly the most photogenic person I've ever seen. Forgive me you guys, I am just Mariah's biggest fan. I think she is as close to perfect as anyone could be. I think Miss Mariah Carey is one of the most underrated artists out there & she deserves some recognition.I would also like to say that the other actors in this film were great as well. Max Beesley for instance. Great acting & great looking, this guy really had my eye. Where has he been all of our lives? Also Da Brat & Tia Texada did a wonderful job as well. Did I mention I can't wait for the video? Ok, all silliness aside. This movie was full of heart. It makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you laugh, makes you cry. It is full of inspiration & life lessons.Wakes you up a bit. Don't ask me how but they throw in a love story as well. I am amazed that they could give equally to each aspect of the film, but they did. Please see this film & get the soundtrack. You will truly be impressed by both. I love you Mariah!!!!!!Glitter GLITTERS & SPARKLES!!!!!!PEACE! GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!

I mean she didn't cry when he died... I mean the girl's mother left her and she held it all in... than automatically the person she loves died too and you expect her to go crazy... she did in the limo and when she saw her mom... i mean thats what made it better. She held it all in... thinking she lost everyone she loved than when she found her mom... it all came out. The one person who could understand... what could of been better...

Well and her getting to see her mom at the end see i don't get to see my mom anymore so um...when i saw that part my mom came to my house and i just started to cry.

Is it really because the acting is bad? Surely not in this day of Julia Roberts and Angeline Jolie. The music is not so bad, not compared to the likes of the rest of what is served up via MTV.The blame is universally put on Maria, who understandably has since wilted under the storm of criticism. But the lesson here is simple for me -- the filmmaking skills of her support team are execrable. That's the problem. We know how to make anyone look good, from the Pussycats to Madonna to Michael Jordan. Heck, Altman even took a bunch of non-singers, told them to write their own songs and made one of the best films ever.It was just a bad call, that's all. How odd that one of the few storylines is about this very thing. They had two choices either outMTV MTV, or completely throw the audience off by riding another pop trend. Since the goal was to add `dimension' to their product, the latter was the only way to go. I think I would have done the Dancer in the Dark routine destroyed her in public, as it is obviously what would have happened anyway.  "},{"Title":"Silver Strip Error!?

Mariah Carey is not a bad actress! The Max Beesley guy is good aside from the fact that he wasn't really sure about his accent. It's well-written for a movie entitled 'Glitter'. The poster's a little to 'festive' as Mariah would call it for me because there are some somber moments. Eric Benet's good too. The one problem I have with the music is that she rarely hits a high note. The songs are well-written but still the high notes are why we all like her, right? Also at times, her hair is really weird, which is good because it does supposedly take place in the eighties. I have to admit, as cheesy as it sounds, I cried at the end. I know I'm a dude, but 'never too far' is like my favorite song by her. I wasn't surprised by the fact that Dice you-know-whats (i won't give it away if you haven't seen the movie)in the end cause i had already accidentally read about it. She even finds her mom! All in all, a great movie that was ruined for most by the nervous breakdown. Once again, way underrated.P.S. You'll get annoyed by Billie's publicist.P.P.S. Billie, what a masculine name!

It's about a biracial girl, Billie Frank (Mariah Carey) who was born to a African-American mother and a white father. Her mom was a singer but she had some kind of drug or alcohol addiction which interfered with her career. Then Billie's life starts to change her mom carelessly set the apartment on fire nearly endangering the life of her daughter. Then the next scene, Billie is taken away from her mother and into foster care. She meets her friends, Roxanne (Tia Texada) and Louise (rapper Da Brat) who stay with her for the rest of her life. Then we go to 1983 where Billie and her friends are dancers. They then get signed to sing backup to a horrible singer named Sylk and the producer decides to have Sylk lip-sync Billie's part. One night at a nightclub, a DJ by the name of Dice (Max Beesley) finds out that Billie actually sang Sylk's part. He instantly falls for her and wants to produce her. Billie agrees to, she becomes a superstar, but realizes the life of a singer isn't as glamorous as she thought it would be. Dice turns obsessive, her friends hate her fame, and all the drama goes downhill after that. In the end, Dice ends up getting shot before Billie's concert and killed. I loved the last part where Billie meets up with her mom again. It was beautiful.I think it's a great movie and all Mariah Carey fans should see this movie. And for the other people who hate this movie If you don't like it, don't watch it! This movie is a million times better than Crossroads or From Justin to Kelly.
