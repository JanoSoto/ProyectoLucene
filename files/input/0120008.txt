Some of the shoot-outs that take place in some areas that you wouldn't even think of (car wash, alley, movie theater, etc.). Plus, the cinematographer Peter Lyons Collister and composer Harry Gregson-Williams excell in making the movie even more entertaining. The scenery has a very colorful and artistic look to it and the music doesn't get too loud. I think of the movie as Lethal Weapon made like in the style of John Woo, who is one of the film's producers.The Replacement Killers certainly hits the center of the bulls-eye with hair-raising accuracy.

In this respect, CYF's performance is slightly superior to his HK work because he is required to be far more subtle than some of his more over-the-top roles. Heresy, i know, but what many people might see as the film's vices could be considered virtues less action and fewer lines of dialog allow a more authentic emotional story to develop and CYF to do more actual acting.

All his life he's followed the orders of his superiors, but when his latest hit is meant to be carried out not just on a hardworking cop named Zedkov (Rooker), but also his seven-year-old son, Lee finds he can't pull the trigger. In order to disappear and get back to his family in China, he needs forged documents, so he goes to see Meg Coburn (Sorvino), an expert in such things. Soon enough, Wei sends many waves of goons to kill off the unlikely duo. When an underboss, Kogan (Prochnow), can't kill them fast enough, Wei sends for The Replacement Killers - played in the movie by Schweiger and Trejo - to kill not just Zedkov but also Lee and Coburn. This all sets the stage for lots and lots of gun shooting. Who will get killed and who will get replaced? Find out today...It seems pretty obvious, especially looking back now, that The Replacement Killers was an attempt to bring John Woo-style action to Hollywood. Woo did act as executive producer, after all, but did not direct the film. That, in this case, went to Fuqua, and this was his first feature-length production after a career making MTV videos in the 90's, and it really, really shows. There is a lot of style and flash, but not much of a narrative structure, as you might expect from a background like that, and certainly on someone's first attempt. (Evidently there was more character development at one point, but it was left on the cutting room floor). If this all sounds like negative criticism, it's not. The movie is lightweight and entertaining, and without a doubt it delivers the action goods.Chow-Yun Fat is one of the coolest cats around, and no one looks more awesome shooting guns or putting on sunglasses. In the 90's there was an attempt by Hollywood to also put Jackie Chan in theaters, and that was appreciated, but seemingly did not last long. We, of course, enjoyed seeing Operation Condor (1997) and Jackie Chan's First Strike (1996) on the big screen. If it could be done with Kung Fu, why not Gun-Fu? And who better to play the classic killer with a conscience than Chow-Yun Fat? With endless gun battles and slo-mo moments (slo-moments?...actually that would be misleading as there are no slow moments in the film), all set to the sounds of the prerequisite late-90's electronica such as Tricky, The Crystal Method and Death in Vegas (apparently Portishead was unavailable), how can you lose? If you're a fan of action setpieces (and who isn't), you don't.Such things as described above were tried unsuccessfully before, i.e. Killing Time (1998), but, thankfully, The Replacement Killers gets the simply-plotted assassin shooting movie right. There's enough cannon fodder for the good guys to shoot at and it never really lets up. Backing up Fat and Sorvino is an impressive cast of Comeuppance favorites Michael Rooker as the cop, Danny Trejo as one of the Replacement Killers, the fascinatingly-named Clifton Collins Jr. is the Machine Gun Joe character, Patrick Kilpatrick as a baddie, Jurgen Prochnow as another baddie (looking a lot like Robert Davi here), and, in blink-or-you'll-miss them goon roles, action mainstays James Lew and Al Leong. And at only 84 minutes without the credits, it all comes in at a good running time. More movies - hell, ALL movies - should be 84 minutes. Kudos to the production for a reasonable length here.So while wags may complain that there's not much substance and the whole thing is like an extended music video, those people are missing the point. There's no time to waste as The Replacement Killers remains fast-paced, enjoyable fun.

Director of The Replacement Killers seeks to play to Chow Yun-Fat's strengths, by making a movie that is in many ways similar to a John Woo movie. But it doesn't quite succeed. While The Replacement Killers seemingly offers everything your average Chow Yun-Fat/Woo film does, it is all delivered in a fairly bland fashion, resulting in a fairly forgettable movie. First and foremost, the is HEAPS of action in this movie. Chow Yun-Fat fires his two guns like he always does. There's shootouts in car washes, there's shootouts in apartments, there's shootouts in video arcades, there's shootouts in cinemas, and a variety of other places. The problem is, the action just seems pretty uninteresting, and the answer to why I can't quite explain. The story is decent for an action movie, and resembles that of The Killer, one of the most famous Chow Yun-Fat/Woo collaborations. Chow Yun-Fat himself looks pretty much exactly like he did in that movie. All the acting is quite good, with the exception of the HIGHLY ANNOYING Michael Rooker. There's some pretty big names in this movie. All in all, The Replacement Killers is a decent movie, but it doesn't really do anything above average, and just comes off as fairly uninteresting and bland. A shameless copy of a John Woo movie.

Chow Yun Fat, in his first US role, plays a contract killer with a conscience (don't they all?) who goes on the run with Mira Sorvino after failing his mob boss. Essentially, it's a long sequence of bullet-ridden action scenes in a style similar to John Woo's superior Hard Boiled.Clearly hoping that US production values would improve the fast-paced martial arts movie, the director forgot one key ingredient martial arts. Aside from escaping a few loose holds, Chow simply guns the bad guys down like Dirty Harry on speed. In fact, the whole movie runs like an extended shoot-out as bullets and protagonists fly through the air with the greatest of ease. Not since Desperado have I seen such a huge amount of ammo being fired and so much of it missing. The template seems to be shoot the Hell out of the scenery and then pump the baddies full of lead several times over, extra points if they fly backwards through a window. True, the action is well shot and exciting but when it's a relentless barrage on screen, only the location changes and the viewer begins to lose interest. I played two games of Backgammon on my mobile, meaning this film fails my so-called Nokia test for keeping my attention span.Despite the special effects and choreography, the US (in general) can't make action films as good as the Far East. Acting in this is pedestrian at best, wooden and stereotypical at worst. Can someone think of any film where Jurgen Prochnow plays a good guy or where he doesn't have a forty-a-day vocal growl instead of a normal voice? The Replacement Killers does nothing new to interest the viewer and does nothing to inject some new ideas into a rapidly declining genre of film. The best thing about this is the fact that it introduced Western audiences to Chow Yun Fat, who can be a good actor when he wants to be. But, like Jackie Chan, his best stuff is made on the other side of the Pacific. Consider which of these films you'd rather see - Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Bullet-Proof Monk. Sadly, The Replacement Killers is more of a Monk than a Dragon and left me feeling disappointed. Like most of the gun shots in this film, this one misses its target and should have been much better.

If the action had been good, this would've at least made it a passably fun action flick, but the overall one sided shootouts as well as the hyper camera angles fail to make this enjoyable for fans of CYF's HK work. Even more disappointing is Chow Yun-Fat himself who is so held back and one dimensional that his part could've been played by Jean-Claude Van Dmme without any difference. All the movie is about is a guy dressed in cool garb systematically destroying anyone in his path without any form of plot or soul. Once again had the action sequences contained more suspense, more grit and indeed a sense of danger to the horizons this would've been fun, but alas this is not the case, and The Replacement Killers is a disappointing clich√© brought to life. *1/2 out of 4-(Poor) "},{"Title":"Derivative thriller delivers the action goods","Date":"25 December 2004","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS Aspect ratio 2.391Sound formats Dolby Digital / SDDS-8John Woo (who else?) co-produced this debut US vehicle for Asian superstar Chow Yun-fat (or 'Mr. Fat', as he's known to some careless movie fans), in which Chow plays a hired killer pursued by ruthless gangster Kenneth Tsang Kong (BISHONEN) after refusing to assassinate the family of a cop (Michael Rooker) who killed Tsang's son during a drugs bust. Mira Sorvino plays the plucky con artist hired by Chow to provide him with forged documents so he can flee the country, only to find herself caught up in Tsang's lust for vengeance, as monstrous hit men Til Schweiger (DER BEWEGTE MANN) and Danny Trejo (BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT) arrive on the scene to exterminate both Chow and his immediate family. For all its flashy visuals and explosive soundtrack, Antoine Fuqua's derivative film ploughs a well-worn furrow, slavishly imitating the Hong Kong action-thrillers which first brought Chow to Hollywood's attention, whilst completely disregarding the emotional/thematic resonance that distinguishes Asian cinema from its western counterparts. Chow is OK, as usual, but the part doesn't require him to do very much, and the entire cast (including an underused J√ºrgen Prochnow) plays second fiddle to the slam-bang pyrotechnics.

The Replacement Killers is yet another one of those films available in more than one version, there's the common theatrical cut which was widely released & then there's the 'Extended Cut' (interestingly not known or advertised as a 'Director's Cut' anywhere) which runs for around ten minutes longer give or take a couple of minutes & I will be basing my comments on the ordinary theatrical cut which is the only version I have ever seen. The plot is very thin, it contains all the hallmarks of a John Woo Hong Kong action flick dealing with themes likes trust, betrayal, honour, family, loss & revenge but The Replacement Killers is a very shallow & forgettable US attempt at copying that distinctive John Woo action style. The character's are paper thin (although to be fair to it the 'Extended Cut' apparently has more development), the dialogue is sparse & almost minimal & the actual action scenes are surprisingly poor & lacklustre. Virtually every action sequence in The Replacement Killers is the same as the last with constant shoot-outs between bad guy's who can't shoot straight & good guy's who rarely ever waste a bullet. It becomes very tiresome & I found it pretty tedious too, I just thought it was a poor story with poor repetitive action scenes & overall I am really struggling to say anything particularly positive about this film.Apart from a shot up car & an exploding van at the end every action scene in The Replacement Killers feels exactly like the last with lots of people shooting at each other. OK sure the locations change but various people jumping over things, sliding across the floor & dodging bullets are essentially exactly the same from one scene to another. I usually like the big budget brainless Hollywood action films & find them very entertaining but this I just couldn't get involved with or get into at all. Although the shoot-outs are well choreographed they are fairly flat & repetitive in my opinion. The film tries to be very cool with lots of dance music, stylish cinematography that keeps the camera moving & darting about & there's lots of posturing & posing as various character's wear the latest sunglasses, carry & shoot using two guns instead of one & dress in sharp suits but there's absolutely no substance to go with the style.According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $30,000,000 which amazes me, I can't really see where all that money went at all. There are no big Hollywood stars, not much in the way of action & I don't understand why this cost so much to make. Shot in Los Angeles in California. The acting is alright but no-one is given too much to do, this was Chow-Yun Fat's US feature film debut, Sorvino is OK while Michael Rooker is wasted in nothing more than a cameo.The Replacement Killers is a Hong Kong style action thriller that I thought was actually pretty poor all round, a really shallow & dull plot along with some repetitive action scenes kill it for me.

Those who are fans of Chow-Yun Fat and the Hong Cong action genre will be more than able to enjoy this more than decent American interpretation of the energetic direction of John Woo. However, those not familiar with the genre, (which is considered most people), will have trouble toning in to this action thriller due to the lack of a fully constructed plot.Now that I have written my critic consensus on the movie itself, I will give my personal opinion on this extremely underrated American take on most John Woo Hong Cong Action flicks. Personally, this movie doesn't have many problems in terms of an action movie, it is just overlooked due to its motivation of the story that leads to the action. Performance wise, I had never seen Mira Sorvino is any other films, but her performance was satisfactory due to her smart remarks and corniness, she also has great chemistry down the line with Chow-Yun Fat's character. I also happen to be a fan of Chow-Yun Fat, who in most cases, gives his best performances in Hong Cong action flicks, but this performance is not to be overlooked, as he might not say much, but in this case letting the handgun do most of the talking is just fine with me. My final thoughts of the film is that it is much worth seeing due that all Chow-Yun Fats masterpieces are made in China.

If that's what you're looking for you won't feel like you've wasted your time watching this, but I doubt you'll be left feeling that you've just experienced a cinematic masterpiece either.

Replacement killers have nothing to do with anything. It regards Chow Yun-Fat who is sent to kill a cop who put away his boss's son. The cop had no choice but upon showing up at the funeral the father voices his hate. Yun-Fat spares the cop's son and meets Mira Sorvino who concocts an I.D. card until her residence becomes plastered with bullet holes. Lame and predictable with director Antoine Fuqua handling the action, which may be the only ambitious element of the film. Yun-Fat rises above the material playing a guy who can express mercy to those unable to defend themselves such as the boy he is ordered to target. Sorvino is hardly involved and exists mainly as a possible love interest. Michael Rooker as the cop is placed in a difficult position but will realize that Yun-Fat is not against him. Kenneth Tsang plays the true villain whining over losses. The action is fast and furious but the screenplay is dull and full of familiarity. The third act is basically one huge violent blow out where the good guys triumph and the bad guys wish they had signed on to a better film.

The Replacement Killers is a mix between Hong Kong Cinema and Hollywood. The ending is good but still very Hollywood though the action and the story in a sense is very Hong Kong. The main character, John Lee, is a hired killer that has a special weapon, and that is the hand gun. He doesn't run round with machine guns blowing away villains, nor does he jump into a martial arts extravaganza, but just relies upon his pistols. Thus there are a lot of gunfights in this movie as the police and a criminal organisation try to put down this rogue killer.John Lee is a professional assassin who has been blackmailed by a criminal organisation to kill people for them. The son of the boss, Mr Weing, is killed in a drug bust and Mr Weing decides that he wants the son of the cop who killed his son dead. This is an eye for an eye mentality. The problem arises when John Lee discovers that the person he has to kill is a seven year old boy. Thus he refuses to do the job, angers Mr Weing and is hunted down to be punished.This movie is about style and pride in one's job. John Lee is a killer but there is a line he does not cross. He only kills those that he has been paid to kill and those who are trying to kill him. He is not ruthless, which Mr Weing considers to be a flaw, and will not kill innocent bystanders nor will he kill children. One gets the impression that John Lee did not want to start killing anyway.There are a number of similarities between the Replacement Killers and the Killer. The Killer is far better than the Replacement Killers could ever think of being because Replacement Killers has been dragged down by the Hollywood dream world where as the Killer has no such restriction. One big difference we can see between the two movies is that John Lee is much more in control of his situation. Jeff was continuously on the run and in the end the fight came to him. John Lee began on the run but then took the fight to his enemies and defeated them. Victory was fleeting in the Killer, but victory was absolute in the Replacement Killers.

As it turns out, the man who hired John Lee is crime kingpin Terence Wei (Kenneth Tsung of Die Another Day); he wants to see the man, Detective Stan Zedlov (Michael Rooker of Mississippi Burning), who killed his son lose his own son. A child is irreplaceable, Wei assures Lee who is an outsider. Scar City scenarist Ken Sanzel penned this straightforward shoot'em up. The Replacement Killer is neither as exciting as either The Killer or Hardboiled, but at 88 lean, mean minutes, it doesn't wear out its welcome. Poetic Justice lenser Peter Lyons Collister makes everything look dark and polished in this high body count actioneer. The Rock composer Harry Gregson-Williams furnishes an atmospheric orchestral sound track score that enhances the suspense. Lee has Zedlov's son in the sights of his rifle when he decides that he cannot kill a child, so he asks his friend for the name of somebody not associated with Wei who can create a passport for him. No sooner has John Lee gone to visit Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvina of Mighty Aphrodite) who has an office in the Olive Building than Mr. Wei's henchmen are on to him. A brief but lethal shoot-out ensues with our hero making a clean getaway, but the police nab our heroine. Four of Wei's gunmen die in the shooting. Detective Zedkov doesn't have enough to arrest Meg so he lets her hit the street again in the hope that she will take him to what he wants. John Lee visits Meg again and they go to the car wash business that Eddie owns where they find not only his dead body but also Michaek Kogan (J√ºrgen Prochnow of Beverly Hills Cop 2) and more gunmen. Zedkov and the cops show up after the main shoot-out but our hero and heroine manage to escape. Don confuse luck with skill, Wei reprimands Kogan after the assassin eludes the villains at the car wash. Wei has Kogan hire the eponymous murderers. Til Schweiger plays Ryker, and Danny Trejo is cast as Collins. They arrive by airliner and try to ice Zedkov at a movie theater when he has his son with him. Lee and Meg show up to thwart their plans. Ryker dies, but Collins survives the fracas. At this point, John Lee decides to remove Wei as his primary source of trouble. Along the way, Meg helps him obtain is forged documents and firearms. They make a good team when they go into action gunning for the bad guys.

But you can tell that John Woo was involved with the project. His style was all over the project. It would have been nice if Woo had directed this a couple of years ago and made his american debut with this instead of Hard Target.      One of my favorite things about the film was the filming of action scene's in unusual places, (Car Wash, Movie Theartre, Arcade).

While the film does have some exciting action sequences, especially at the car wash and at the end of the movie, it doesn't fully exploite the acting talents of Chow Yun-Fat. Because Hollywood emphasizes story over style or stunts I was hoping to see Chow Yun-Fat really break through to the next level. In Hong Kong, several stunts or shootouts are brainstormed and a story is built around that, stunts over story. In Antoine Fuqua's freshman effort, he places style over substance that really does nothing to advance the story. The aerial shots of the city and the filtred shots of Wei's lair serve as distractions rather than enhancements. The main saving grace is the acting in this film...Prochnow,Chow and Tsang turn in incredible performances considering English is their second language. Overall an okay movie to rent or own.

Whenever Chow Yun-Fat gets on the theater screen, one can't help but be drawn to his charisma and super-human presence. Whereas other actors may depend on their physical presence or witty lines to carry them through a movie, Chow Yun-Fat is able to catch the average viewer off-guard. This film is rather short on plot, admittedly. However, one should remember that John Woo started out releasing films like BlackJack and Hard Target for American audiences. Face/Off was quite popular, riding on the laurels of Broken Arrow. Speaking personally, I'm glad John Woo hasn't sacrificed his trademark gunfight sequences for plotlines that go nowhere.Having the main character have a sense of honor is not a new concept in John Woo action films (i.e., Face/Off) but it is a welcome one. Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino are also an unlikely match, but their combined presence makes this an enjoyable film.

With production crew coming from the Hong Kong school of moviemaking to the lead character, played by Chow Yun-Fat, success is almost guaranteed.The movie is as any action movie should be, fastpaced, quick dialog and explosive action. The gunplay and fighting scenes are not the standard Hollywood I-have-a-bigger-gun-so-you-die mentality but more realistic in execution. Here the hero doesn't shoot down helicopters with arrows or crawl out of an exploding building with a slight rip on his jacket. He gets shot, it hurts enourmously from just a single wound. Reality is that way. Another sidetrip from the normal Hollywood guideline to have a bit of comic-relief and/or a male sidekick that gets into trouble or a ghastly female who spends her time onscreen screaming and strutting around with no clothes on. Mira Sorvino (plays Meg Coburn) is tough, sexy and has her own agenda during the entire movie. A small love/romance/friendship-what-ever develops between the the two main characters (John and Meg) but it stays on a realistic level. No shady bedroom-scene, no passionate kissing after a gunfight, no 'I-cant-be-without-you' scene. Just the work of the eyes and voice hints to the romance motif. In all it's a good action movie, maybe a bit more commercially viable than most Hong Kong productions are, has a good soundtrack and holds up to repeated viewing.

I'd say on a cool factor, The Replacement Killers was slightly below those two movies, and much higher than movies that try to be cool (like Two Days in the Valley, or crap like that).  Killers marks the Hollywood debut of Chow Yun-Fat, one of the most highly regarded Asian actors ever.  A couple years ago, another Asian import had this mystique about him.  You remember Jackie Chan?  Very popular all over the world, except in the U.S.  So they brought him over here, had much success with Rumble in the Bronx, and since then has faded away.  Chow Yun-Fat is not Jackie Chan.  While Chan's movies tend to be comic-action, Yun-Fat's films are dramatic action (The Killer, Hard Boiled to name a couple).  He only learned English a couple years ago, so when he speaks, it's a little hard to understand at times, but you understand what he's trying to get across.Yun-Fat plays John Lee, a hired assassin, who is hired to kill a cop's son. He can't bring himself to do it, so the man who hired him, hires replacement killers (get it?) to kill Lee, and to kill the cop's son.  Along the way, Lee needs a fake passport to get to China to save his family, and the lovely Mira Sorvino happens to be the one who makes the passport.  So the two of them end up on the run from the replacement killers, and to save the cop's son.  Now, why is Lee a hired killer?  The explanation given is murky. Wei, the man who hired Lee, seems to own Chinatown (to be honest I don't even remember what city this took place in... I think it was L.A.).  Wei forces Lee to kill for him.  But like I said earlier, Yun-Fat can be hard to understand at times.  But this movie isn't about story, dialogue, it's about action.  And it has a lot of action.  It's the actions sequences that make it a cool movie.  First there's the mystique about Yun-Fat being the action star of the world.  Then there are the slow-motion camera shots, and the slow-motion sounds.  The cool music in the background, the scenes in the temple.  The best thing about Face/Off was the action sequences. Poetic violence is what I called it at the time.  The Replacement Killers has that same sort of feel, although not as deep as Face/Off was.If not for the action scenes, this movie wouldn't have been worth the money.

And with that said, this film becomes really, really, really bad.It wouldn't have gained publicity at all if there weren't the possibility to slap a John Woo-label on it, and the lengths one has to go to, to actually see anything worthwhile in this film makes one wonder is there a special place some movie directors go as pilgrims to learn How To Make John Woo Flicks or is this just another piece of trash that should've stayed on paper? If this Woo-school really is, well then this film sure is a freshman's job.

In the film, Chow Yun Fat plays an assassin. After his mob leader's son is killed by a police officer in a shootout, the leader sends Fat on a mission to kill the cop's 7 year-old son in retaliation, eye-for-an-eye. But as the boy appears in the hands of his father seen by Fat through the crosshairs of a sniper rifle, Fat decides he cannot kill the boy. This angers his boss, who sends in replacement assassins to kill Fat as well as his family over in China. The whole film Fat is dodging bullets with Mira Sorvino, who specializes in making false passports and ID papers and Fat is trying to get papers so that he can travel to China to save his family. This movie is full of shootouts and excellent action scenes, which are probably the best that I have ever seen in a film. There are many stunts and although this movie takes place in the US, it has an Asian-like feel to it, which makes it more suspenseful and a lot of the movie is in dark locations, which make the gunbattles more exciting. SEE THIS FILM AND YOU WILL THANK ME. Feel free to email me if you have any questions or comments.

It barely runs over 80 minutes, and spends most of it displaying as many gun battles as possible.  That's the film's sole appeal, that and Chow Yun-Fat, probably Hong Kong's most effortlessly charismatic actor, and it's quite obvious this movie exists as nothing more than a vehicle for him as an introduction to American cinema.  Did it work?  Hard to say.  Only the success of Bulletproof Monk can tell.Yun-Fat stars as John Lee (one of the most painfully generic Asian-American names I've heard in a while), a hitman with a conscience.  When he refuses to kill a cop's seven year old son, the Chinese mob's after him, hiring (drum roll) replacement killers!  Through a tiny bit of contrivance, Lee is teamed up with Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino) for the remainder of the film, and from there on out, it's one massive gun battle after another.For what's being aimed at here and for what little the script offers, the acting is actually quite good.  Yun-Fat is still as likeable as ever, even if he does struggle with his English.  Mira Sorvino is almost always solid, though roles like this have done little to expand her career.  As for the replacement killers, one of them is played by none other than Danny Trejo, and he and his partner have all of two lines of dialogue between them.  There's also Michael Rooker, who's making a living out of playing cops.The action is what matters and for what it's worth, Antoine Fuqua does a reasonable job.  Granted, he's not John Woo, but the shootouts are fast-paced and exciting.  Every action sequence plays out the same way, it's only the setting that changes so action fans looking for something creative might find themselves a bit disappointed.  Equilibrium or The Transporter this most certainly is not.  The Replacement Killers rates poorly on plot and characters, but it has a distinct style, and while it probably could have gone further with the Yun-Fat/Sorvino chemistry, there's more than enough action to entertain.

Its a fast-paced movie with little story but great action and plenty of style. Its not up to the standards of the Chow/Woo collaborations that came out of Hong Kong in the late 80s and early 90s, but its still great fun.The Replacement Killers, a story of an assassin with a conscience (yes, we've seen this before) was my introduction to Chow Yun-Fat and Heroic Bloodshed-style cinema in general. I must say that when I first saw it I was blown away. The action sequences, though paltry compared to those in, say, Hard-Boiled, appear hyper-kinetic and downright innovative as presented in American cinema. And Mr.Chow is cool personified. Furthermore, even with limited dialogue (he's still learning the language people!) its clear that the man can act. He conveys much more emotion and presence with his eyes alone than many actors do with all the dialogue in the world. We see his tortured soul when he peers through the scope of his sniper rifle, wrestling with his decision to do the right thing, and we know he means business by his dark brooding glances in the night club. We see his guilt when he sees his reflection in the mirror. Then there's Mira Sorvino, an amazingly beautiful and talented actress, who's obviously having fun here, and looks as good as ever as she guns down the villains. A very good supporting cast also plays its roles expertly.Antoine Fuqua is not the greatest director ever. But he knows style, and the film is one of the most visually and stylisticly impressive action movies I have ever seen outside of Hong Kong. Furthermore, while the story is weak, the dilemma that John Lee faces is a real one, and the decision he makes is heroic. We all hopes he saves his family, and kills as many bad guys in as cool a way possible along the way. In this way the movie engages the audience and works in doing what it set out to do be a very cool action piece, with bullets and sunglasses standing in for plot and dialogue. It works far better than, say, The Corruptor which repeatedly seemed to forget it was an action movie. The Replacement Killers never does, and it delivers on its own premise. If you don't like that premise, fine, don't watch it. But it does succeed at what it tries to do. Conclusion TRK is a good and under-appreciated movie, 7.5/10. It is a fine introduction to Chow and the genre; after this move on to The Killer, A Better Tomorrow and Hard-Boiled, all of which combine action with story and characterization in a way you have never seen or imagined in American cinema.

However, Fuqua still has a few things to learn about action choreography and editing but considering this is his first feature film, completely forgivable.

The stakes are upped when replacement hitmen are brought in to kill Meg, Zedkov's son and Lee.Already a global star due to the iconic films and choreographed violence of John Woo films, Chow Yun Fat came to America, had English lessons and was put in a film that copies the formulae that had made him a huge success.  The plot here is similar to that of The Killer, in that a hitman is crossed by his employers with the end result being gun fights a plenty.  However the themes running through that film are absent here and noise and action replaces them.  That doesn't mean that the film isn't good, but rather than be different it feels like an average retread of the Hong Kong formula.The action scenes are good without being great, lacking the flair of his HK work.  Partly this can be put at Fuqua's door.  Even with Woo as executive producer Fuqua can match the master for this sort of stuff.  They are exciting but where in the same way that Woo's first US film (Hard Target) felt like it was watered down, so too does this film feel like HK action done for a teenage American audience.Fat is an excellent actor of great range but this film seems scared to have him do anything beyond diving around with guns.  His English dialogue is limited to a few lines at a time and any more detailed scenes are carried in subtitles.  However in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Fat could not speak mandarin and had to learn his lines phonetically &#150; he can speak English here so why not trust him enough to speak it.  Sorvino is OK but her character is a little bit of a clich√© and is a tough chick side kick at best.  Rooker is alright but lacks screen time or a character to speak of.  Likewise Prochnow is just a bad guy sidekick with little to do.In HK Fat had great roles in ultra-stylish violent ballets with Woo.  In his first American film he has a standard American actioner which owes a lot to HK but never reaches the impact of those films at their best.  Worst than that he is not allowed to act beyond limited dialogue and gun play.  Is this film bad?  No, it is just quite average for anyone who has seen any of the Woo/Fat collaborations from HK although for an American action film this is pretty good value for 85 minutes.

I was a bit sceptical about Chow making ultra-violent action in America, but the movie turned out to be excellent.Chow Yun-Fat plays John Lee, a deadly assassin, who is pursuaded by a ruthless gangster boss, to do some killings for him.  At the beginning of the movie, there is some splendid action-scenes at the disco, where John kills 5 criminals.  A cop kills the son of the gangster boss, then the gangster boss calls in John to assassinate the son of the cop.  John is as always an assassins with a heart of gold, so he can`t pull the trigger.  The gangster boss then sends a bunch of killers after John, who tries to escape to Chine, so he can save his family from the gangster boss. He needs a passport, and Mira Sorvino is the one he visits to get it. During his visit, the killers appears at the front door, and then the fun begins again. TRK is the first movie directed by Antoine Fuqua, and what a debut it is too! The only downside of this movie is that it is too short, it needs at least another 20 minutes of running-time. John Woo is an executive producer of this film, but this is better than some of Woo`s own American movies. It`s better than Hard Target, Broken Arrow, Blackjack and even the mighty Face/Off at times.

In fact, they will stand there with their guns still pointed straight out even though they can see you're on the ground now.We also learn it's quicker to shoot people near you by completely spinning all the way around so your jacket flings in the air, rather than simply aiming and firing at the target, as Chow does about 60 times in this film. We also find out that Chow actually has the ability to leap from one end of a theater row to the other, if he's attempting to block a bullet from hitting a child. It's also never established how they knew that the cop and his son were at the theater - this is worse logic than Passenger 54. They just show up, the same way Wesley Snipes just shows up at the carnival where the bad guy went in the latter film. Filling us in on how they know this would only slow the film down.What amazes me most about this film, besides the fact the two heroes are fired upon at least 500 times and get hit once, where every shot they make hits their targets with dead on accuracy, is that this is another movie where a guy treats a women with total disrespect, kidnaps her and does nothing to make him like her, she knows him for about two days and doesn't want him to go for some reason. It's like a reality show where the contestants have known each other for two days and one person always says I love you guys. Except there's no reality in this show.

With over 1,000 DVD's and 2,000 Video's in my movie collection, I have a large reference library to compare this film.The film takes on the edge of The Professional, however an middle aged illiterate man is not protecting a 10 year old child. A master mercanary is protecting the lives of a stubborn woman, whom he falls in love with, and the fate of his mother and sister.The film mixes the violence of Chinese Mafia, Mercenary Killers, and a solid emotional love story in the background.The film begs to know more about John Lee, he is the perfect assassin, however, he is not brutal.  Just as Tony Montana in Scarface refused to blow up a car with women and children in it, John Lee refuses to kill a child in his father's arms.The confidence John Lee brings to the screen is unheard of, he simply exudes it.  With his black on black outfit, his black shades, and his pinpoint accuracy with a weapon, reminds me of the original Lethal Weapon, before it became a soap opera.  Mel Gibson's character, as well as, Gary Busey's character were truly Lethal Weapons, however, I would take John Lee at my side over the both of them, in a heartbeat.This movie was widely passed over because of its budgetary constraints. Yes, Sorvino is an Oscar Winner, but has done nothing of significance since her Oscar, until this film.  Chow Yun Fat makes a stunning debut, before reaching the stardom  as the King of Siam, or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  In addition, Antoine Faqua known primarily for music video's, was widely ignored as an uproven commidity.  Now, after great fanfare and success with his new creations, he has taken the steps to rank amoungst the finest filmakers in the world.How did this little publicized, low budget thriller miss so many viewers? I believe it to be a combination of the unknown, Chow Yun Fat, Antoine Faqua, and a grossly under publicized marketing of the film.  Maybe Hollywood believed only Spike Lee can make a movie of importance? Not any more...In short, Antoine Faqua creates a brilliant masterpiece of cutting edge, Matrix like graphics, with brutal and violent overtones similare to that of a Scarface, Lethal Weapon, and a dramatic love story a.k.a and Officer and a Gentleman.

As I said above, this film is a good action movie - nothing more, nothing less. It lacks the depth of characterization and entanglements of its characters as well as their tragic development. It is just too straight, although Yun Fat's acting is very cool; somehow he can be considered to be the Eastern Robert De Niro. What is good about this movie is the art of presenting it Fast, stylish and violent. The camera seems to be in motion all the time and it really shows the grace and the elegance of Chow's motions especially during the shoot-outs; just like John Woo, director Fuqua makes a ballet-like dance out of these scenes and this is exactly what Yun Fat's fans are awaiting. What I also was happy about is Til Schweiger being featured in this movie. As he always played the good & friendly guy in Germany (e.g. Knockin' On Heaven's Door), it was a pleasure to see him as a ruthless, yet cool killer who seems to be a real maniac (e.g. the way he looks when he recharges his machine-gun).

There are also strong parallels to Blade Runner's overall cinematic presence.Whilst the plot is somewhat thin on the ground, the film stands on its own in terms of both hard-boiled action, cinematic vision and sheer enjoyment value!Anyone who didn't like this either didn't take the time to appreciate the atmosphere, or should go back to watching something more up their intellectual alley, like American Ninja.9/10 "}{"Title":"The best Hong Kong action movie ever made","Date":"16 March 1999","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  My rating- ***1/23 1/2 StarsThis is the best Hong Kong action movie I have ever seen.

Yet much less violent than most such movies, it's mostly the sound and flash of bullets, speeding cars, etc. Only a few moments of up close gore. Both Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino are great to look at, and carry off their emotionally cool yet highly ethical postures superbly. I was completely entertained.....what a relief after seeing the disappointing, posturing Rushmore the same day.

The characters are cliches (the heroic assassin, the hard-boiled cop, the smarmy street girl).  This film does not even pretend to be about plot or character, however.What this film offers -- and delivers, in spades -- is adrenaline-pumping action with stylish direction.  With a running time of approximately 90 minutes, it is brief and to the point. The action sequences are frequent and well-paced.  Meanwhile, Fuqua's direction turns typical gun-blazing sequences into works of art.For the most part, the film serves as a showcase for Chow-Yun Fat's style and grace (I presume that he's a trained dancer).  He's the type of performer who plays essentially the same character each time he's on screen, and that character is an Asian James Bond.Our hero receives ample back-up from our heroine.  Anything that Mira Sorvino does tends to be fine with me for the simple reason that it's Mira Sorvino doing it.  In this case, she proves herself capable in a role that requires running and jumping rather than acting.The greatest flaw in this one is its inclusion of typical action-movie problems ('professional killers' who can't seem to hit a barn door, submachine guns that don't run out of rounds).  Such mistakes, however, are fewer and further between than in a typical Hollywood action flick.If you can handle action served straight up, don't miss The Replacement Killers.

It is the elegance of violence.  The visuals that transform each scene into an exciting, impossible romp through the ability to survive. Talented choreography with the added difficulty of a constant grasp of a piece of iron in hand. Far beyond any filming of this genre that I have seen in a while. Not for those who can't live without fine dialogue, but then again, while watching this movie, who needs it and who cares.

Though I guess that really shouldn`t be taken as a terrible criticism . After all John Woo appears in the credits as executive producer so you know what to expect , you know that the man walking through the disco floor in the opening sequence is going to get into a shoot out and you know what type of shoot out he`s going to get involved with . That`s right one of those shoot outs where he flings his coat off , turns 360 degrees fires his gun in a ridiculously held manner , throws it away ( Even though there`s no way he`s used up all the rounds ) pulls out another gun and kills even more bad guys As I said it`s not really a criticism but like a Jerry Bruckheimer production I do get bored with these type of balletic choreography action scenes rather quickly . Impressive first few times you see them , boring by the time you get to the millionith time , and as you can imagine everything is style over substance with people running around in slo-mo dodging bullets that seem to explode with everything they come into contact withI will give the producers some credit for making a serious revenge flick that tries to paint the characters as something more than just one dimensional cyphers , but like I said I`ve seen too many of these type of action sequences to still be impressed by them  "}{"Title":"It`ll blow you away!!!!","Date":"15 December 1999","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  The Replacement Killers is the first American movie of Hong-Kong superstar Chow Yun-Fat.  Yun-Fat plays John Lee, a professional assassin.  In the opening scene, Lee is entering a techno-danceclub, he walks up to a table, where some criminals are sitting, he puts a bullet on the table, and starts shooting them. Next, a police-officer kills the son of Terrance Wei, a powerful syndicate leader.  Wei calls for Lee to take out the police-officer`s son, and Wei`s goons will kill Lee`s family if he fails.  Lee is unable to pull the trigger, and must therefore run away from the killers sent by Wei. Chow Yun-Fat demonstrates what he does best in this movie, he kicks a#¬§.  The actionscenes are beautifully choregraphed, but not quite as good as John Woo(but they are very similar). Still, this is a powerhouse of a movie. The action is non-stop and will blow you away. 10/10  "},{"Title":"Action that falls really short","Date":"15 December 2009","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" I was just watching the movie and was hoping to give it a second chance since I really love the action films directed by John Woo and enjoyed the works of chow yun fat. The reason this movie falls flat is because it is not a John Woo movie. It was produced by Woo but he had no hand in the story. A story that really sucked too.The story starts with chow walking to a night club. You know he needs to stretch out his double pistoled action arms for the beginning. I'm saying to myself Okay he messes up some people so we are gonna get action. Heres the bad part, THE OTHER CHARACTERS. Every other character that comes out seems like a reproduction of another character we've seen in similar action film. Another faulty problem is the action scenes are really dull and boring compared to the rapid style like violence we see in John Woo's other films. In this film, Chow kills like 5 or 8 men in his usual style like persona. Whats the problem? In The Killer (Which replacement killers is a knock off of.) He is mowing down 20 to 30 henchmen and they die ugly deaths. Replacement killers doesn't have that heart pumping stop til you drop action that made Hong Kong Cinema legendary and often imitated.Acting by chow isn't bad but he doesn't have a lot to go on. He really doesn't. At least Jackie chans US action vehicles have him as his usual self. in replacement killers he's just not dynamic or persuasive as a cold blooded killer. Mira sorvino is also misused, I like her acting but the writers should've looked over the script again to realize that her character seems more of a comical sidekick then a sexy love interest. The Asian gangsters are very wooden and very uninteresting. They don't know how to write them in. In John woo's films they are just regular people with different personalities and interest. In this film they are all stereotypically the same. Michael Rooker really sucked in this movie so I won't talk about him. Danny Trejo is in it but isn't used as he is in desperado playing the sophisticatedly cool and deadly Navas.Overall this movie is no John Woo film. I recommend Hard Boild The Killer A better tomorrow part 1 and 2, Bullet in the head and his American vehicles Face off and Broken Arrow. I also recommend just sticking to Hong Kong films if you want action that is really gut gripping and has stunts that'll blow CGI out of the water. Sorry Antoine, just let Woo do all the action.

Very few of them hit their targets... who teaches these hit men to shoot? This was nothing but Last Man Standing done in Chinatown. Instead of hiring a high priced actor like Bruce Willis to make the film, the producers opted for some Chinese guy named Lo Fat Wu or whatever.
