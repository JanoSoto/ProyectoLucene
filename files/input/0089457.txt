This is a beautiful movie! It is funny, full of action and Romantic (yes, with a capital 'R'.)I saw this movie the first time when I was eleven, back in '86. It then took about four years before I saw it again, but I never forgot the feeling it left me with This is heart-wrenching romance. I only recently bought the video. For some reason I have been unable to track it down sooner. Anyway, I pulled the video tape out of the box and, with mixed feelings, I slid it into the video. Would it be the same? Would it still move me? (Would the music still suck? *grin*) YES!!! It WAS the same! It DID move me! And NO! The music felt strangely right.Yes,  I would like to see this movie with a classical score, just to find out... But the awfulness of the score (btw, it's not bad all the way) only furthered the porcelain beauty of the visuals (watch the scene with the hawk flying over a still lake -- it's wings dipping into the water -- I get goosebumps), and the pure genius of the characters and dialogue.Now, the main actors/actressRutger Hauer This, along with Blade Runner, is your finest work ever! Mr. Hauer delivers a top-notch performance as the brooding, cursed one-man army called Navarre.Matthew Broderick This WAS your finest hour. Yes, Mr. Broderick has given us suspense and laughter after Ladyhawke, but nowhere near his performance as Phillipe.Michelle Pfeiffer Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the most beautiful woman in the world? I do not mean perfect, because that would be predictable. No, Mrs. Pfeiffer (Kelley?)is simply beautiful in an ancient sense. She is sprung out of a myriad of romance stories. There couldn't have been a better choice for this part. That innocence, that beauty. Isabeau comes to life in the incredible acting. Too little screen time makes you appreciate it even MORE when she enters the plot.The rest of the cast is too good to be true. John Wood's Bishop, who only comes to life after he realises what is about to happen in the end. Before that he is only a shell of a man. And a big BRAVO! and a huge round of applause for the wonderful performance of Leo McKern as the massive, drunkard priest Imperius. Also watch for Alfred Molina in an, even for him, nasty role as the hunter Cez√†r which he pulls off with his usual finesse. Bravo Mr. Molina.Finishing up, I would like to mention, in brief, the equestrianship. It is wonderful. I know only a little about horses, but I know that those used in the movie are not your average show jumping ponies. *grin* The riders are incredible. I have not yet seen riding of that kind. They make it look effortless. They are one with the horse.The comment to tip the scale (which is already tipped almost over to What-are-you-nuts?-Haven't-you-already-seen-this? ALL of it is made without computers!!!Happy viewing!

Despite the production's troubled history between two studios (Fox and Warner's) and endless rewrites by an army of scribes, it still finds everyone involved at the top of their game, and early into most of their careers!Rutger Hauer's bad guys were always more interesting and charismatic than his good ones, but his role as Captain Etienne Navarre was the noteable exception. In the best shape of his career both physically and artistically (with the exception of BLADE RUNNER'S Roy Batty), he painted the perfect portrait of noble hubris, tinged with the ache of unfulfilled love for his fair maiden, and the sorrow of an eternal curse that could never  be lifted. Even Errol Flynn would've been envious.Michelle Pfeiffer has been many things in her career earthy, sensual, campy, courageous, but she would never achieve the combination of radiant strength and vulnerability that she did as Isabeau D'Anjou. There have been other actresses who have looked better and given deeper, more nuanced performances since hers...but it's a REAL short list.When I saw the previews, I was pretty sure that the main thing I would like the least about this movie was Matthew Broderick, whose Philippe The Mouse Gaston was a character I was pretty sure would grate on my nerves. And for the first part of the film, he definitely does. Credit it to Matthew's likeability and talent that before the film's end, though, you're rooting for him as much as for the two leads.And let's not forget an extremely impressive supporting cast John Wood (WAR GAMES and JUMPING JACK FLASH), Leo McKern (the OMEN films and PBS' Rumpole of the Bailey), Alfred Molina (PRICK UP YOUR EARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and the TV series THE LADIES' MAN) and a wicked turn by Ken Hutchison as Navarre's nemesis. For the couple, the friends or the family who want action AND romance, too, you can't do better, (and can always do worse.) And as far as the music controversy is concerned, I am a longtime fan of Andrew Powell's work back from his early days with Alan Parsons, and later with The Project, and I thought that the juxtaposition of the contemporary music with the medieval setting worked perfectly. This is, after all, a fantasy, not a historical record of true events! Enjoy it for what it is! "},{"Title":"Rutger Hauer ....

It will have you rooting for the good guys and yelling at the screen for them to vanquish their enemies.This romantic fantasy is an escape for the real world to a place where love, honor, and courage are rewarded.  Where true love is possible, and two people love each other more than life itself.  A love like this is almost impossible today.I adored this film so much that I have three copies of the movie and two of the soundtrack by Alan Parsons Project.  I think the background music goes so well with what is happening on the screen.  Each of the main characters has their own musical composition, and will make you cheer or cry.

As a matter of fact, anything with sword fights was great in my book. And since I grew up in the days before Lord of the Rings came along, my favourites were always mid-to-late-eighties fantasy epics like The Princess Bride, Willow, and Ladyhawke.It's all about an outcast knight and his lover, who have been cursed by an evil bishop to become animals during night and day, so they're never together in human form. He becomes a wolf and she becomes a hawk (hence the title). The knight enlists the help of a young thief to break into the cathedral and take his revenge on the bishop. Aside from the basic premise, it's more of a historical movie than a fantasy movie. There's no magic other than the curse, and no trolls or giants or anything, which was partly the reason I enjoyed it so much.I've also always loved this movie for it's great storyline and interesting characters. Philipe's conversations with God still amuse me, as does the drunken monk played by Leo McKern ... It comes from director Richard Donner, who of course brought us Superman I & II, the Lethal Weapon movies and so on. This is essentially a well-directed movie, although a lot of people have issues with the choice of soundtrack. It's kind of a techno-poppy thing, which I blame NeverEnding Story for. A lot of eighties fantasy movies went with the same idea, but it works with Ladyhawke better than it works with most others, although I would of course prefer a more conventional and less intrusive score. On the whole, the sets and the props are pretty convincing, although some of the fight sequences aren't particularly great.Here we have an early Matthew Broderick performance which shows how little his acting skills have developed since. Not that he's a bad actor, just an early bloomer I guess. Cult icon Rutger Hauer, of whom I have always been a huge fan (Blade Runner, The Hitcher, The 10th Kingdom) gives a fantastic performance as the outcast knight, and as we all know it's never a bad idea to have Michelle Pfeiffer in a movie.You should definitely see this movie if you're a fan of the genre, or of any of the actors involved. It's a wonderful fantasy adventure for all ages.

This has been one of my favorite movies since it first came out. (I saw it with my best friend, who had a crush on Matthew Broderick.) Anyway, it's a very stirring, timeless (except for the music) story of love, heartache, hope and redemption. Wonderful.Rutger Hauer is amazing. Strong, even frightening at times, but still tender and vulnerable. Of course Michelle Pfeiffer is at her absolute most beautiful. She really does seem to possess the face of love as Phillipe says. But Matthew Broderick really makes the movie. He's more than just comic relief (although he is hilarious); he keeps the story grounded. Without the character of Philippe the movie would be too ethereal, untethered. Philippe is the everyman--our connection to the magical beauty of Navarre and Isabeau.I've heard that the story is based on a medieval legend, but I haven't been able to find it. If anyone has a link, please post it as a review on this site; I'd love to read more about it. Thanks!!

Matthew Broderick and Leo MacKern gave this magical story its humanity. Some reviewers have disparaged its musical score by Vangelis. I've always felt that it fit the mood and setting of the film.

It works because of the great mixture of action, beautiful photography, likable lead characters, humor, touching romance, suspense and no offensive language. Yes, here is an adult film that everyone can watch, and that' no clich√©.Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer are handsome leads but Matthew Broderick, as Phillipe Gaston, is the star of the show. He provides the humor and is involved in almost every scene. There is a lot of religion in here, both shown positively and negatively. Broderick's character acknowledges God and constantly talks to Him. Hauer refers to Him, too, but Broderick is the talker. However, here is yet another case of a French Catholic clergyman being the evil bad guy. (Is one ever shown in a positive light?) John Wood effectively plays the nasty  Bishop of Aqulia.This is a curse story about two humans who turn into hawk (Pfeiffer) and wolf (Hauer) by day/night never seeming to be human at the same time so they can be lovers and live happily ever after.It's interesting all the way, with my only suggestion that it could have been a 10 had it been chopped about 15-20 minutes in length.Overall, though, a solid film and one that has been enjoyed by everyone I know who has seen it.

What I loved about this film is that even though it's a wonderful mixture of action, adventure, romance and comedy, it is a simple film. The execution is solid and it shows that Donner and his cast and crew have put a lot of heart in the making of the film.The score is kind of funny. At times there's a beautiful symphony that expresses the beauty of the settings and then, during the action scenes, there's the typical 80's hip track which brings a smile as it nostalgically reminds me of that wild decade. 'Ladyhawke' is indeed very beautiful to look at. The cinematography is superb as it gives a very spacious view and the composition of the shots are very well arranged.No CGI has been used and that marvelously stands out as it gives the film a purer look and only reminds one of the days before CGI was overused, when cinema looked pure and authentic. 'Ladyhawke' is a fine example of movies that can look great and sometimes even better and more effective without CGI (other examples being the Star Wars trilogy (80's version), Indiana Jones etc).The performances are topnotch. A radiant Michelle Pfeiffer completely owns the title role. Her understated performance and quiet yet strong presence (like a hawk) brilliantly contrasts Rutger Hauer's wolfish character. Hauer too does a fine job. An evil Alfred Molino is barely recognizable and Leo McKern wears the menacing look very well. John Wood provides some great comic relief. However, it is Matthew Broderick who stands out. He performs naturally as the vivacious, energetic, deceitful thief who loses his heart to Ladyhawke and at the same time he is determined to reunite the lovers and rescue them from the wrath of the curse.Overall, 'Ladyhawke' is a beautiful movie that satisfied my filmviewing experience. It gives that nostalgic feel, it amuses, it fascinates and it feels enchanting. No wonder it still feels fresh after more than two decades.

I remembered Matthew Broderick being deeply annoying; as it turns out he's just mildly irritating. And I remembered the soundtrack being bad; but good God, it's *appalling*. Whoever decided that a tragic, touching supernatural romance would be best accompanied by funky 70s synthesisers (I don't think they're fitting enough to even be classed as 80s) should be forced to eat their own afro. Yes, all of it. I can honestly say I have never heard a less appropriate musical score in my entire life. It's not that it's bad, exactly - it'd probably work pretty well if the lead character was, say, Shaft.Still, when the crazy disco beats aren't violating the atmosphere, there's some good stuff going on. Richard Donner already had serious directing experience under his belt in 1985, and Ladyhawke is beautifully shot and paced with some gorgeous scenery to take in. There's just enough action (they give it some proper welly in those swordfights), John Wood provides a proper boo-hiss malicious villain, the dialogue never quite slips into melodrama despite teetering on the edge occasionally, and it's always a pleasure to watch Rutger Hauer in one of his few good roles before he degenerated into self-parody. (Well, if we're being honest it's a pleasure to watch him in his godawful recent stuff as well, but for different reasons.) Above all the film's got heart, which is more than you can say for 95% of the cack that Hollywood churns out, and it deserves some small credit for that at least.

Definitely a unique type of love story.We begin with Phillipe Gaston played by Matthew Broderick, I think one of his better acting jobs, an escapee from the Prison of Aquila, something that has never happened before. However, in his zealous celebration, Phillipe finds himself facing Aquilan guards in the name of the Bishop. He is saved by Captain Etienne Navarre, a former Capt. of the guard for Aquila.His rescue doesn't come without a price though, Phillipe is told that he will get Navarre back into Aquila in order to kill the Bishop in revenge. Phillipe has little choice but to agree to the task. In his traveling with Navarre, Phillipe discovers an entrancing young woman who always shows up after the sun sets and Navarre disappears.Phillipe eventually discovers that her name is Isabeau d'Anjou, Navarre's love, and that because of the curse she is Navarre's hawk companion by day and that Navarre turns into a black wolf by night, a punishment put upon them by the Bishop of Aquila because Isabeau did not return his affections.With the help of Imperius, the monk who betrayed the lovers secret to the Bishop in a fit of drunkenness, Phillipe discovers that a solar eclipse will allow the lovers to confront the Bishop together as man and woman and break the spell forever. They encounter Navarre's stubbornness to the plan and must think of a clever way to help the two lovers.The story is beautiful, Rutger Hauer & Michelle Pfeiffer put in terrific acting jobs. A terrific story of love conquers all with a twist. The bits of humor thrown in make the characters endearing. Would recommend it any day, but perhaps I'm bias by now. 10/10.

What is Ferris Bueller doing in medieval France, though?  Perhaps the film needs some salty leavening, and at least he makes the plot work a little more efficiently.  Overall, I don't have a rational judgement to make but a purely emotional one I can never forget this film.  It has haunted me since the first time I saw it.

I believe this was her third or fourth film role in the early days of her career. She is simply stunning as Isabeau, the title character. Rutger Hauer was at the top of his career and was perfectly cast as Navarre the cursed knight/wolf to Pfeiffer's ladyhawke. Matthew Broderick plays Phillip Gaston a pickpocket who becomes first an unwilling accomplice then a loyal ally to the lovers.

This is a beautiful film, wonderfully written, hauntingly filmed, and great performances all around by the cast. I know the score is a popular debate, you either love it or hate it. I loved it, it's a blend unlike any other i've ever heard and stands out rather than blend in like so many others.Rutger Hauer gives a powerful and convincing performance as the handsome, brooding, captain of the guards who is cursed, outlawed and hunted, his only crime falling in love with a beautiful woman.And she is beautiful too, the luminous Michelle Pfeiffer absolutely lights up the screen every scene she appears in. Not only is she beautiful, but also smart, kind and compassionate. Thankfully she's not the typical damsel in distress who stands by and does nothing. I was completely sold as to why Hauer would give his very life to protect her. This was the movie that made me a lifelong fan of Pfeiffer.Matthew Broderick was perfect in the part of Phillipe, it was nice to be able to see him stretch himself in range and play a different kind of role than i'd become accustomed to watching him in. John Wood was excellent as the sadistic Bishop who cursed the couple in his desire for Pfeiffer. I was really convinced of his downright evilness. And last but not least, I really enjoyed Leo McKern, the drunken priest who betrayed the couple to the Bishop. He finds redemption in helping to break the curse and defeat the Bishop. For those who haven't seen it, I don't dare think of giving it away.Also, an evil little cameo by Alfred Molina, years before most people knew who he was. As mystical as this movie is it doesn't rely on a whole lot of special effects overwhelming it. (Of course this was before CGI was around.) But still it wisely decides to rely on the emotions and ability of the actors, director and scenery to convey the story.A really beautiful, soulful, mystical film.

Instead I'm going to focus on something a few others here might agree with, most will not.The soundtrack by Andrew Powell, whether congruent with one's idea of a 'fantasy score' or not, defines Ladyhawke in such a way that anything else would seem generic. People around the net say 'oh if only this had a full orchestral score', and while I'm a huge fan of Zimmer even at his most bombastic, I am firmly convinced that Ladyhawke would be simply less prominent and memorable were it to sport the usual infusions of Wagnerian overtures and chorus -- worked great for 'Excalibur' (albeit Orff in that case) but nowadays you hear the chorus all over the place. I remember a trailer for 'Spiderman 2' with an ominous chorus and while it was impressive, I realised that orchestra+chorus is as common in recent movie scores as the 'deplorable' synth was in the 80s.I loved the score to Ladyhawke when I first heard it -- 1985, BTW -- and to this day associate certain themes with certain scenes and characters. In fact, I'd say it's my exposure to Ladyhawke's soundtrack in my youth that led me to explore progressive rock and metal and discover a whole genre that *blends* genres. And didn't Ladyhawke's soundtrack do that? You have synth-rock, guitar work, Gregorian chanting, a traditional Italian dance...with a bit more complexity and polish, this soundtrack could easily pass as a stand-alone concept prog-rock album.Consider a film that one could easily parallel with Ladyhawke Flesh+Blood. Rutger Hauer again, medieval again, not quite romantic but certainly lots of fighting and castles and whathaveyou. And the soundtrack? I remember one theme and it was fine, but hardly distinct.Anachronism is a tricky thing to infuse, and most films fail much harder than Ladyhawke when it comes to using it. And it's not as if the entire score is rock-synth, as I've already clarified. I feel the moments that used it were appropriate exciting fights, the main title (somehow you have synth sounding both epic and romantic there!), the tension of Phillipe's escape...One last point the rock-parts of the soundtrack never take themselves that seriously. Anachronism used properly reminds the viewer that it's just a movie and to enjoy it. The fact that Ladyhawke can do this and -still- move the viewer is to me testament that the soundtrack did *not* kill the movie. No need to cite box office statistics here there are enough flops that did spectacularly well on video and then DVD to invalidate a claim that box office flop=bad movie.So there's my defence of Powell, if you will. Extricating the soundtrack from Ladyhawke would be like trying to remove someone's heart without leaving scars.

We get to see the prowess of Rutger Hauer in his prime,  the beauty of Michelle Pfeiffer (who hasn't aged since 'Grease 2'),  and an engaging Matthew Broderick.  There is fantasy and intensity in the telling of this fable,  made by the director of &#145;Superman' and &#145;Lethal Weapon',   successfully putting you under it's spell.  Even so without any big time special effects.However, it shares the same fate as Ridley Scott's spectacular 'Legend'.  They were both fairy tale movies released in the United States in 1985,  and both suffered from a non-traditional soundtrack.  In the case of Ladyhawke,  which is a period piece,  pop music is added.  It is a bold but curious decision to take a classic fairy tale and give it music with a modern beat.  Was this the decision of the director and producer Richard Donner,  to perhaps latch into the MTV craze, which was taking over the earth at the time?  Ridley Scott admits when talking about 'Legend',  that trashing an orchestral score for modern synthesisers for the US release was a mistake.  And here the Alan Parsons pop tunes clash horribly with the more traditional music supplied by Andrew Powell.  It also clashes with the swept away feeling of being in another place and time as the frankly dull synthesiser music sounds like somebody switched the radio on while you were watching the movie.   And so this movie as well as 'Legend' flopped in the box office.  Perhaps they could have released the DVD with a alternate audio track that omits the Parsons music.  It is curious in fact the Alan Parsons is not mentioned anywhere on the DVD box.  If you can forgive the flaws,  you will be rewarded with a film that has more character and fun than the new `Star Wars' movies.

At dawn, she transforms into a hawk, and at dusk he transforms into a wolf; they can never meet. But when Navarre meets Phillipe Gaston, the only man to ever escape the dungeons of Aquila, perhaps there is a chance to lift this terrible curse &#x85;There's nothing particularly outstanding about this movie, but it scores well because it's strong in every element - good story, first-rate production, great cast, fine score, excellent photography - it's just classy all round. It's also nicely old-fashioned, a bit like an Errol Flynn romantic swashbuckler from the thirties (Captain Blood, say) - the goodies are noble and heroic, and the baddies are evil through and through; there are thrills and spills aplenty, comic interludes, a touching love story, and they all live happily ever after. It may be an old formula but it works rather well, and Edward Khmara's intriguing story sweeps along energetically. There is one potential liability - Broderick - who looks like a Jewish kid from Manhattan transplanted into Europe in the twelfth century. He contrasts sharply with Hauer (who could have stepped right out of the pages of Ivanhoe) but he makes his character work by gaining our sympathy and via all his neat comic asides to his Maker. Hauer is outstanding, and McKern and Hutchison offer strong support, as do the many talented animal actors (there is a particularly tricky scene with a wolf on an ice floe). Equally authentic is the fantastic location photography by the great Vittorio Storaro and production design by Wolf Kroeger (First Blood, Enemy At The Gates). It was all filmed on location in northern Italy - notably at the preserved medieval town of Castell' Arquato in Piacenza province - and looks sensational, with fluid tracking shots of horses thundering across cobblestones and beautifully lit smoky stained-glass interiors. This is one of those enjoyable cosmopolitan movies (American-Italian-British) where the varied backgrounds of the filmmakers contribute to a highly original experience. Last, but not least, there's a pounding symphonic rock score by Andrew Powell which complements the action and sweetens the romance. All in all this a cracking flick, extremely well directed by the talented Donner, and well worth a matin√©e screening.

The villain is cheesy (and--surprise surprise--a Churchman). Mouse might have the potential to annoy other watchers--but not me.As for the story, it's excellent and wholly satisfying. Rutger Hauer turns in a wonderfully nuanced performance as the knight mysterious and menacing, or kind and noble--yet not quite sane obsessing about his lost love, and becoming irrationally jealous of Mouse's friendship with her.Michelle Pfeiffer is breathtakingly beautiful here as the face of love, vivacious and merry and queenly, just as she should be--neither anachronistically feminist nor totally lacking in gumption, but a very authentic-feeling heroine in the vein of Galadriel or Luthien from Tolkien's tales.Matthew Broderick is likewise excellent in his role as the story's grubby, cheerful protagonist--again, a very authentic-feeling character, the kind of guy you just know could be found scrounging his way through life in the Middle Ages somewhere. His incessant chatter weighs the other characters' taciturnity well, and he grounds the film in a way no other character could.The special effects are perfect--a more recent film might try to show off what cool things it can do with pixels, but in this film they are glossed over, and used to great effect only when they are really needed. Action scenes are likewise shot with economy and and grace, and the whole production--dialogue, costumes, sets, fights, and effects--is very low-key, exposing a very simple, very effective, and very touching story.It is, in fact, a pretty much perfect movie.

I can't believe that was twenty years ago! I own the DVD now. It's not a perfect movie and I think the ending is a bit rough after all the magic that takes place before. But it's a beautiful story with stunning cinematography and good acting. I love Matthew Broderick's turn as Phillipe, he's cute and hilarious. Leo McKern breaks our heart when he tells us Navarre and Isabeau's story of doomed love, as does the pain etched into every line of Rutger Hauer's face. The thing I really like about this movie is despite Phillipe's conversations with God, it's really grounded; unlike other 80's fantasy movies there's an element of reality to it, it really feels like it's medieval setting, shot on location in Italy, with the dirty peasants and even the rich and corrupt Bishop's trappings of wealth are still medieval. The cathedral, the ruined abbey, the peasant's cottage, the dungeons, all feel real, not like movie sets. And the emotion between Isabeau and Navarre, and the sad old drunk, the desperate, lovesick young pickpocket make us feel, is human and real.The funny thing about the music is that it never bothered me when I watched the movie when I was younger, now it's so cheesy it's almost unbearable. I guess that's the way fads are, they work at the time, but then later on you're like What were we thinking?

But if you have the staying power to participate in this emotional tale of two cursed lovers, watch and await, a film experience that is truly quite unique! The film is beautifully shot, and every time the frame fills with imagery of mountains and forests your heart yearns to walk the country shown on screen. When you think that this film was made in '85, and that today's genre films aren't considered complete without their epic cinematography, I'd say LADYHAWKE was something of a predecessor to films like LOTR. The score however is something you'll either love or hate. I personally would have preferred it if the film had a slightly different score, not so electronic, but a bit more staid. Then again, the buoyant score does a good job of saving the film from seeming too devastatingly solemn. Though LADYHAWKE was marketed as a fantasy (IMDB, Amazon and the like seem to link it with films like WILLOW), I prefer to look upon it as mytho-poetic. After all, the story is set in the real world, in 12th century Italy. This vast, gorgeous landscape of high mountains, misty forests and rolling meadows is overseen by the serpentine Bishop of Aquila (John Wood). In the dungeons of Aquila, a young and talented peasant crook named Philipe (Matthew Broderick) escapes. The Bishop, fearing that his unassailable power might be damaged by the audacity of the fugitive, dispatches a squadron to find and capture him. As Philipes antics continue, events finally unite him with the mysterious figure of Navarre (Rutger Hauer), and his loyal hawk. The two strike up an alliance, and Philipe gradually becomes embroiled in a very tragic and tangled reality Navarre is doomed to transform into a wolf every sunset. His hawk is no hawk at all. In her true form she is Navarre's love, Ysabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer). The lovers have lived this way for many years, under a curse, put upon them by none other than the Bishop himself...who lusted after Ysabeau, and summoned the curse as a means to end his own perpetual wretchedness. Navarre, Philipe, Ysabeau and a sympathetic monk, Imperius, embark on a mission to end the curse and exact revenge on the corrupt Bishop.The events of the story unfold rather objectively, which is a shame. There are moments in the film when you relate perfectly and easily to the tortured passion that lies at the core of the story. However, there are also moments when the characters come across as a little too unflustered by the situations they find themselves in. Brooding blonde Rutger Hauer in particular seems to express very little anguish at his characters predicament, and spends most of his screen time in a state of cool, calm, gallant pride. I took his casual manner to signify how embittered and hopeless his character has become, but nevertheless, there were times when I wished he would do something other than mutter. Also, as the fight scenes in the film are noticeably very strange and at times gawky, I began to feel that Hauer was not being given the liberally proportioned epic moments his character deserves. The scene in which Navarre confronts the Bishop has a very laboured feel to it, but maybe this was deliberate? Michelle Pfeiffer is, as ever, stunning; she has too little screen time to draw us deeply into her character, but when she does appear on screen, she is formidable, majestic and brave. Matthew Broderick is charming as the cunning but likable Philipe, and his performance acts as the resin of the film that holds everything together. Over all, I give the film 8/10; it certainly isn't perfect, but the film exudes a poignant, haunted and mythic mood that every romantic will contentedly lose themselves in.

This film is a bit of a fantasy film, just not the type you would expect. It is a bit different, not really a Conan film or Lord of the Rings, but still having some supernatural qualities to keep the film really interesting. The story is about a romantic couple who are cursed. By day the man is a night, but at night he is a wolf. The female by day is a hawk and by night she is human and boy she was attractive as she was played by a young and sexy Michelle Phifer. She never looked better only getting somewhat close in the film Batman Returns as the very sultry Catwoman. The story is a bit more romance than action, but there is action in it so it is all good. It could have been better, but then there are so many movies that could have been better. Matthew Broderick is kind of the glue in this film as his character is the only one who can interact with both characters as he does his best to aid them, even trying to find a way to cure them of the horrible curse. Unfortunately, Hauer's character is hell bent on revenge and refuses to listen to anything that may cure them instead wishing to kill the man responsible to the curse. The movie has a very nice finale to it and the only thing I feel really compelled to complain about is that of Broderick's character not really finding anyone special for himself. A minor complaint, but I could not help but feel bad for him during the finale.

It is a well-handled, stylized, spectacular romance about a beautiful lady (Michelle Pfeiffer) and a courageous knight (Rutger Hauer) who, for reasons you may already know or will discover for certain when you see the movie, are cursed. It's also a relatively quickly-paced action film about how a diminutive pickpocket (Matthew Broderick) helps the unlucky couple out when he has his own scores to settle, particularly with a deceitful bishop (John Wood) and a ruthless soldier (Ken Hutchinson). The only reason why this film loses points is because of the music, which is, in my opinion, more terrible than if Giorgio Moroder had teamed up with Andy Warhol. But Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is astounding, and the performances are terrific, as are the nowhere-near-overdone special effects.

They are even handled simply, with no computer graphics, complex fades or transitions - just some pretty camera work, and there they are, the man a wolf, the woman a bird.The plot carries the story, each incident necessary, well-handled and well-told. The Italian scenery is stark and empty, the impoverished villages are rough-hewn, and the camera work adequate, straight-forward, and true to its story. But the interest in the viewing comes from the characters.Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer are each beautiful and tragic. Matthew Broderick, though his accent slides around a lot, is as endearing a thief and trickster as he should be, both courageous and puny. John Wood is both cruel and cowardly, but believably, not a cartoon-like movie villain. And Leo McKern cannot help but be wonderful as a weathered old monk, simultaneously loving life, yet eaten up with guilt. Great folks bringing class and interest into material that lesser talents would make sound like a high school play. All and all, well worth watching, and quite engaging for kids and adults.The only real problem is the sound track. It's dreadful. The Alan Parsons score absolutely screams pop, pop music. It doesn't match the period, the mood, the characters, or the imagery.

This curse was set upon them by an evil Bishop who secretly loved Isabeau and was driven to anger when he discovered that Navarre, Captain of the Guard, loved Isabeau himself.The most heart-wrenching part of the film is when Navarre is trapped in ice by the priest and the thief and he wakes at dawn in human form just in time to set eyes upon his beloved Isabeau, also in human form, for the briefest of moments.He reaches out to her and their hands almost touch when the sun creeps over the horizon and she turns into a hawk. He cries out in frustration with tears in his eyes.The music by Alan Parsons is, even if not medieval, is still very atmospheric and lends itself well to the style of the 80's.

(There are one-sided stories in the same vein with ONE of the two lovers turned into an animal - `Swan Lake', for instance.)The makers of `Ladyhawk' haven't let their superb idea down.  -Okay, maybe they did with the music.  I don't know WHAT they were thinking there.  Still, one day, with any luck, the music will be SO dated as to sound timelessly antiquated - or so I hope.

Someone really went to a lot of effort to find the right parts of Europe to film in.  (The settings are gorgeous.)

Of course a modern audience will guess immediately what the `night yet day' line refers to, but that's the point WE know, the characters (as you'd expect of ordinary folk of the time) don't know, and the story is ten times as tense and moving as a result.

This is a curious tale of love and romance tied in with a typical medieval/dark ages animal based curse. A form of witchcraft cast upon two young lovers by a man of the cloth, a Bishop, simply out of jealousy. A Romeo and Juliet style historical fable.First thing that will hit you with this film are the striking visuals. The story is set in central Italy (I presume) and there is a very real historical grandiose feel to everything you see. All the scenes are set within (or around) real locations, real castles, real towns, real ruins, real old courtyards etc...The visuals are HIGHLY stylised believe me! every shot is incredibly slick and glossy looking, one could coin the term 'historical scenery porn'. Everything looks like a beautiful living water colour painting with stunning sunsets, dawns, dusk's and twilight's set against some jaw-droppingly lush European countryside and rustic ruins villages and fortresses.Admittedly the one draw back about the visuals are they look too clean, almost too good!. I know this is a fairytale of sorts, a fantasy, but there doesn't really appear to be any dirt or mud anywhere hehe. All the buildings are spotless, the countryside is perfect, every character is dressed immaculately in clean attire, the horses have gleaming coats etc...It all has a lovely dream-like quality but I just felt for the period some grubbiness was required.The other main thing that will hit you is the strange choice in musical score. I'm sure most would think an orchestral score would be fitting for such material, but no, Donner goes down the 'Tangerine Dream/Legend' route with an 80's electronic rock based set of tracks. There are of course some more traditional tit bits in there but most action and fantasy moments are accompanied by this odd rock score. The problem is the visuals and general style in this film are so good and authentic the score just doesn't sit right in my opinion, it feels a bit cheesy and ruins the classical approach. I'm guessing the film 'First Knight' may have pinched this idea, thing is that film didn't have the spectacularly lavish locations, good cast, slick camera work, timeless story...OK that film was just crap.I think this film also has some great casting. Both Hauer and Pfeiffer really do look stunning with their big blue eyes, makes one feel quite ordinary and pathetic. Hauer really is the true knight in shining armour here, the real Prince Charming...OK maybe not in shining armour but instead uber cool pitch black...errr armour/Jedi robes kinda thing. Typical heroic attire with a sweeping black cape with posh red lining, this guy looks quite wealthy. With his blonde hair, blue eyes and atop his black steed he really does look very handsome, first time in awhile I can genuinely honestly feel comfortable saying a bloke looked attractive, I was envious.On the other hand Pfeiffer has this ethereal-like beauty with her lovely short blonde locks, pale skin, strong facial structure and yet more big blue eyes. She truly looks angelic, the perfect Princess or damsel in distress for Hauer's brave knight, together they really are a perfect match and I really could believe the fact they turn into a wolf and hawk at their respective times (Ladyhawke...speaks for itself right). Unfortunately the film is let down by the one casting of Broderick who is a stain upon this gorgeous film. He is truly annoying with his constant nervous ramblings in that squeaky voice of his. I just wanted to slap him across the face every time he made those idiotic expressions of shock or surprise...good God!.The plot does take a bit of getting used too, Hauer as a wolf by night and Pfeiffer as a hawk by day, it also takes time to explain this which is a bit confusing. There are no horrific mutations or transformations though, its all done with subtle fades and nice eye close ups which works well. Overall I did get the impression the plot was stretched out a bit because there wasn't much to actually do, the aim of the game for Hauer is kill the Bishop who cursed them. Not much more to it than that so I think there is filler or padding here and there, it can feel dull in places. You could say its all style over substance I guess, but that would be harsh methinks.Overall the film looks exquisite and is very realistic to reality, even if it is too clean to actually be reality. Everything and especially Hauer and Pfeiffer are period perfect, the pair look like characters from a classical fresco or mural come to life.

The score is particularly jarring, especially when it includes some soft rock that sits oddly out of place with the pseudo-historical world of the storyline. Nevertheless, it proves to be a fairly engaging little movie that reminded me, oddly enough, of the medieval mystery yarn THE NAME OF THE ROSE mixed with WILLOW, conjuring up a dangerous world dominated by corrupt religious figures and throwing some characters and their bizarre adventures into the mix.The central curse which propels the storyline is cleverly achieved, and the filmmakers employ some talented creatures to bring that story to life. Unable to achieve the effects via limited special effects technology, the reliance instead is on the camera and performing animals to trick the viewer, and it does that pretty well. There's at least one absolutely splendid scene &#x96; where Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer meet, just for an instant, as the sun rises &#x96; which, I would argue, makes the entire film worth sitting through, just for those spellbinding seconds.Elsewhere, the film never slows down with a mix of tragedy, romance and knockabout comedy. As a way of introducing American children and youths into this fantasy world, Matthew Broderick is cast as a brash young thief and we see much of the storyline evolve through his eyes. This isn't great, because I've never liked Broderick and he's on particularly brattish form here, but the casting of Hauer as romantic lead more than makes up for Broderick's foibles. Watch out for a fun cameo from Leo McKern (who seems to be having a ball) and John Wood as the particularly obnoxious villain of the piece. The action is hardly spectacular, but the end result is surprisingly watchable, thanks to that inventive and well-thought-out storyline.

The line between fantasy and reality are blurred so well, you seem quite convinced that this could have happened to anyone...Two characters separated by night and day by the curse of a jealous bishop can only be saved by the most unlikely of events a solar eclipse. But how do you convince each of something that science has not yet discovered? With the help of an old, wise (and sometimes drunk)friend, and the rebellious help of a young new one, of course!

But Ladyhawke is one of his more overlooked films from the 80s. A shame, because with this film, Donner took a decent stab at the fantasy genre, and crafted a fairly original love story with a welcome injection of wit.Phillipe Gaston (winningly played by Matthew Broderick) is a sort of Mediaeval Artful Dodger. A pickpocket thrown into prison, we first see him grumbling his way through an escape attempt (This is not unlike escaping my mother's womb. God what a memory!).He eventually succeeds, being the first person to ever escape the dungeons of Aquila. The High Bishop (a hissable John Wood) sends the guards after him, because he rules over the people with an iron fist, and if word gets out the dungeons are not impregnable, it could inspire rebellion.Gaston gets as far as the countryside before the guards catch up to him. There's a wonderful action scene here where Gaston must outmanoeuvre them at every step while hanging from trellises, donning disguises and even crawling on all fours. It almost resembles vintage Errol Flynn.But Gaston is rescued by Navarre (a slightly hammy Rutger Hauer). Navarre recruits Gaston as his sidekick, because he wants to launch an attack on the castle and kill the Bishop. Since Gaston escaped from there, Navarre figures he might be useful.Navarre is almost never seen without a hawk, a hawk he has tremendous affection for. When its night, Navarre disappears, and a wolf is seen prowling around in his place. As well as a beautiful woman, Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer).Gaston is puzzled by Navarre being visible by day, and Isabeau by night. But when the hawk is injured, Navarre sends Gaston to Father Imperius (a great performance from Leo McKern), a disgraced monk for help. Imperius fills in the blanks.The Bishop wanted Isabeau for himself, but she loved Navarre. So if he couldn't have her, no man would. By making a pact with the Devil, he cast a spell on them both to keep them apart. By day, Navarre is human and Isabeau is the hawk. And by night, she is human and he is the wolf.Now a part of this tragic tale, Gaston and Imperius join with Navarre and Isabeau to break the spell, and stop the Bishop. Ladyhawke really is an unappreciated treat. It would be one of Richard Donner's last really good films for a long while. There is something unique to the story, and Donner manages to create equal parts poignancy to the situation, as well as humour and excitement.Rutger Hauer is a bit of an odd choice for the part of a virtuous knight, and if truth be told, he always seems much more comfortable in the part of an eye-rolling psycho. But he's not bad in Ladyhawke. He's up to the action scenes, and does occasionally get some real moments to shine. There's a very funny scene when Navarre gets extremely paranoid about what Gaston and Isabeau might get up to when she's in human form and Navarre isn't.Michelle Pfeiffer is OK. She certainly looks lovely in her first starring role, but as always, she still comes off as a little too emotionless. She doesn't get as many scenes as Hauer, and they hardly share any screen-time, but there is one scene with the two that makes an impression. A beautifully shot scene where for just a fleeting moment between sunrise and sunset, they glimpse each other in human form, a moment that's beautifully illuminated by sunlight. For that one moment, you really sense their love, and their loss.But it's in the supporting performances where Ladyhawke really entertains. In a part perfectly suited to Matthew Broderick, he gets one of his best roles here. In fact its probably his second best performance after Ferris Bueller. Gaston gets all the best lines and gives the film great energy whenever he's around. And special mention should also go to Leo McKern as the monk who betrayed Navarre and Isabeau to the Bishop, and now wants to make amends. Its a similar character to the one Patrick Troughton played in Donner's Omen, which co-starred McKern.The method Donner comes up with to break the spell is clever, and its a genuinely uplifting moment when Navarre and Isabeau stand face to face after so long apart. The only downer on the whole film is the misplaced contemporary rock soundtrack. It only serves as a distraction, and is completely inappropriate to the tone of the film. But other than that, Ladyhawke is a wonderful, magical fable.It might interest people to know that an episode of Charmed ripped off the plot of Ladyhawke wholesale, and even the solution to the lovers dilemma was identical. I'm amazed Donner didn't sue for copyright infringement. Oh well, at least it shows Ladyhawke is held in regard in some places. After all, imitation is the highest form of flattery.

Michelle Pfeiffer is radiant in her Isabeau role, despite the relatively small amount of screen time she has. Matthew Brodrick is perfectly cast in his impish little thief character of Phillipe. Praise is also due to the stoic Leo McKern in his crucial role as the monk who explains the curse that is the central story. My only character gripes are with Rutger Hauer's wooden portrayal of the hero Navarre, and John Wood's equally mannequin rendering of the evil bishop. But without a doubt, the worst blemish on this well conceived, not-as-well-executed fantasy flick was the dreadful music, which practically screams Early to mid 80's!  If any good came from the music it was that the sonic disaster which is the Ladyhawk soundtrack probably destroyed the movie careers of John Dowland and Andrew Powell.

Lovers (Pfeiffer and Hauer) are cursed by an evil clergyman and they are destined to stay together but always apart, he turns into a black wolf at night, while she turns into a hawk during the day, each transformation at sunrise and sunset. Matthew Broderick, 23 here, plays Ferris Bueller a couple of years before that movie came out. But here they call him Phillipe the Mouse, because he is a petty thief, and he is able to squeeze through small places, opening the film with his escape from prison via the sewers. He eventually must become trustworthy, and the catalyst for helping break the curse.The several battle scenes throughout are not very convincing. In fact, the whole films begs the audience not to take it too seriously. But Michelle Pfeiffer, 27 here, was just beautiful and does a nice job as the hawk. Broderick is fun to watch in his comedic role.The DVD is marginal at best. While the sound is fine, and Dobly 5.1 sound is used rather effectively to surround you, the transfer from film is not very good, and many film defects jump out at you. Also, the widescreen side of the DVD is not anamorphic so I watched the standard side and stretched the image to almost fill my 169 TV screen. There are no extras, no chapter secection, although it is organized in chapters so you can go to a particular place in the film.Overall I enjoyed it, for I like this type of fantasy story for good entertainment.

Pfeiffer, I am afraid to say, has a rather empty role, and isn't given much to do in most of her scenes. The warrior enlists the aid of the boy to kill the evil Bishop who cast the spell...Although several parts of the story are predictable, Donner keeps the viewer's interest going by grounding the adventure and fantasy elements into the realistic setting. Vittorio Storaio's bleak photography is also a nice touch. Ladyhawke is a simplistic tale, but a rewarding one.

He escapes the dungeons of Aquila through the sewer. The Bishop (John Wood) refuses to accept any escape and sends out Captain Marquet with his guards. When Marquet catches up to Gastone, Etienne Navarre (Rutger Hauer) comes to the rescue with his hawk. Former captain Navarre and Isabeau d'Anjou (Michelle Pfeiffer) are lovers cursed by the jealous Bishop. He turns into a wolf during the night and she turns into a hawk during the daylight. Navarre plans to kill the Bishop with help from Gastone to sneak into the castle. Monk Imperius gives him a different plan to break the curse. Meanwhile, the Bishop sends Cezar (Alfred Molina) to hunt for the wolf. Broderick is fun. Hauer is fearsome. Pfeiffer is loverly. I love their interactions. Broderick's time with each side is great. The story is compelling and solid fun high adventure. I saw it in the theater and had fun with the adventure movie. There seems to be some complaints about the synth score in more recent reviews. It does date the movie back to the 80s. Of course, it doesn't fit the medieval time period. It didn't throw me off the story back then. Rather, it amped up the intensity and the joy in the action. It's just fun.

A curse is placed upon noble knight Navarre and his lady love, Isabeau. Navarre is a wolf at night and Isabeau is a hawk in the day. They essentially never see one another. It's always just out of reach for these star crossed lovers. Navarre enlist the help of the thief, Gaston played by Mathew Broderick.Sounds great right? But the sound track stinks. This movie is 1985 and the music sounds 1985. What I mean by that, is that it sounds like the same type you would hear in any Molly Ringwald movie from the 80s. I mean this is a medieval fantasy. Totally unsuitable music. It ruins the mood. Very distracting. Could have used some Joe LoDuca or the late great James Horner.Then we have the cinematography. Nothing special. In fact it looks like the director phoned it in. Super-bright sunny scenes. No shadowing, or filters to set the tone. Nothing. Finally the accents. Broderick, sounds English at first, but then drops completely into American. Michelle Pfeiffer didn't even bother, it was American all the way. Rutger Hauer, I'm not sure what the hell he was doing. He's from the Netherlands, but was doing some American thing that wasn't quite working. It's medieval France. These accents are distracting and sounded stupid. Broderick's character bordered on funny to downright annoying. It was the babbling. Very awful. Michell Pfeiffer was beautiful and serene, but really nothing special. Rutger was the most handsome I'd ever seen and he was dashing and likable.The story was there, but it seems everything else failed. I'd like to see it remade someday. Even an animated version might be great. If they had just fixed these things, it could really have been something. Not a recommended fantasy movie.

It's got a lighthearted medieval sense of wonder and romance that is irresistible. It concerns wandering knight Navarre (Rutger Hauer), and his true love Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) who have been cursed by an evil bishop, and are kept eternally close, yet apart. By day, she is transformed into a hawk, and by night, he a wolf, and never able to be together in human form. Hauer, originally cast as the villain, was promoted to leading man status here (Kurt Russell was in place to play him but Donner wisely handed the reigns to Hauer, who infuses his performance with intense charisma and longing). Pfeiffer is a shining jewel as the princess, giving warmth to her scenes. They are joined on the quest by an unlikely ally Fast talking, troublemaking pickpocket Mouse, played by of all people, Matthew Broderick. Ferris Bueller in the Middle Ages works better than you might think, as Broderick, not the best actor, ramps up his energy and actually has quite a bit of fun with the role. Because Hauer and Pfeiffer don't share any scenes in human form, well almost, there needed to be a third person with them to interact, or it would have been a strange, wordless film. Mouse makes a chatty travelling companion and peppy little sidekick for the both of them. The film has a timeless feel, and an authenticity to its central romance, feeding the main characters quest with heartfelt urgency and emotion. Musically and visually it's a moviegoers dream, all hazy, gorgeous frames and drawn out, paced sequences that are rare in films today.

I loved all of the characters, the plot, the scenery, the costumes, and what few special effects there were.The only jarring thing was Matthew Broderick's constantly shifting accent. They should have sat him down with an accent coach from the beginning, and pinned down how they wanted him to sound.John Wood was excellent as the evil Bishop. He was supposed to be the guardian of the city he was posted in, but he was rejected by Rome herself! He had a mistress on the side, lusted after Isabeau, and placed a curse on her and her honey because she didn't want him! Leo McKern was great as the flawed, grizzled looking monk; all unshaven and his hair flapping everywhere.Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer were fantastic of course. He as the driven warrior desperate to regain his honor as well as his love, and she as the not so helpless woman that has been cursed to live as a hawk during the day.Matthew? Um.....Philippe was an excellent character, if a bit muggy at times. Desperate not to be caught up in the events, but right at the center anyway. Skilled at picking locks, pockets, and probably at stealing hearts as well. BUT, the accent was a major stumbling block, and kept me from really enjoying the performance.

I had heard of it but didn't know much about it other than that Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Broderick were in it and that it was nominated for a couple of technical Oscars (Sound and Sound Effects Editing). I was extremely and pleasantly surprised with this movie. It's a beautiful fantasy with a lovely story and just the right amount of self-awareness to know not to take itself too seriously.Pfeiffer plays one half of a cursed couple who are never allowed to interact with each other as humans; she turns into a hawk at daylight while her lover, played by Rutger Hauer, turns into a wolf during the night. In order to break the curse, they need the help of a hapless crook played by Broderick with a half-assed British accent. (Why the filmmakers decided Broderick needed an accent I don't know, since Hauer and Pfeiffer make no effort to sound anything other than American.) The story has the delicate grace of a fairy tale, and the movie is beautiful to look at, which is not surprising given that acclaimed cinematographer Vittorio Storaro is behind the camera. My wife and I have been having fun with a little movie project lately, watching a bunch of 1980s films that one or the other (or many times both) of us missed originally.

It's an interesting tale.I have to agree with one thing some of the other reviewers of Ladyhawke had to say Rescore the film. Honestly the film is good (although not perfect) but it is some of the film's soundtrack that is bad for the film. Some of the music sounds like a cheap 80's comedy kids flick or some weird science fiction film. In my opinion, if the entire soundtrack was medieval sounding then it would suit the film. A film's score is highly important to bringing about a feel or ambiance to the scene.Outside of some of the film's soundtrack - the great costuming and sets will definitely have you feeling like you are watching something play out in front of you that is from the 12th century.If you like this movie, you might like other similar films Willow, Labyrinth, Legend or The Neverending Story.8/10 "},{"Title":"The best fantasy film of the 80's","Date":"28 September 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" You know, growing up in the 80's with a real thirst for fantasy adventure was pretty tough. There were plenty of books to scratch the itch for sure, but TV? Feature films? Hmm, not so much. Having watched more than enough sub-standard sword and sandals fare (Ator the fighting eagle, anyone? Prisoners of the Lost Universe?) I can honestly say Ladyhawke is the only film I saw from that period that has remained a firm favourite ever since. And yes, that includes Highlander!! The reasons are pretty obvious. The film is directed by someone who at least knows how to set up the camera - I can't pretend that Richard Donner is one of my favourite directors but he does a top job telling this story. The cast is where this film really excels, though. I'm still convinced that Rutger Hauer is one of the great lost leading men in Hollywood history and in this he's awesome. Michelle Pfeiffer is ridiculously beautiful and handles herself very well and Matthew Broderick is excellent as the glue that holds the film together, ace at the comedy and really selling the drama. Also, John Wood is a brilliantly unsettling villain and Leo Mckern, Alfred Molina and Ken Hutchison do great character actor work. The overwhelming feeling is of a film properly made, with a decent budget, quality cast and great locations. The story itself is nicely streamlined, with no unnecessary longueurs and fine pacing. And Finally Hauer might just be riding the greatest horse in cinema history! That's not a spoiler, right? The only real problem with the film is the score, which I admit is...terrible. Why Donner went with a horrible synth and drum machine score for a medieval fantasy love story is beyond me. And probably him, now. That aside, this film is properly brilliant. Really.

It's one of those films I caught about ten minutes of back when I was a kid that stuck with me. So now I've seen it all, and I enjoyed it immensely. I really liked Matthew Broderick as Gaston, a likable thief who stumbles forward and accidentally gets away with things and out of situations, whether being saved by the ex guard captain Navarre (Rutger Hauer being awesome), or knocking his love to be off a cliff just as she's about to turn back into a Hawk. He played a similar character a year later, except that character was less likable. The story is a silly tale of cursed love, the villain, a jealous bishop with magic powers or something cursing the captain of his guards and the woman they both love but who loves Navarre to never be able to see each other as humans, Isabeaux turning into a hawk during the day and Navarre into a wolf at night. It's a silly but imaginative story that makes or a nice dynamic as Gaston has to protect Isabeaux when she's a human and Navarre when he's a wolf. There's also some mumbo jumbo about them having be seen by the bishop both as human to break the curse on a special occasion when day has no night, and night has no day. So essentially, an eclipse or something. One thing I found cool about the film was it's setting, it's very confused and loose; Navarre speaks of his father fighting in the crusades and yet there's magic and sorcery and an evil bishop who apparently rules a kingdom. It's all very silly, lighthearted fun. There are also some great lines from the god-fearing Gaston like like escaping from mother's womb...God what a memory. I enjoyed it a lot. "},{"Title":"Nice Fantasy Romantic Story With Major Flaws","Date":"4 August 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" From the director of Lethal Weapon, Richard Donner gives us movie that truly spells Ridley Scott. Ladyhawke is a layered movie that relies on more than one genre. It's a film filled with love and romance backed up with a fantasy story with medieval setting with witchcraft and animals where evil curses are prominent thanks mainly to jealousy brought on my a man of the cloth trying to keep young lovers apart from each other. In other words it feels like Romeo and Juliet romantic story with a fairytale theme behind it.Right from the beginning, the first thing that will stun you is the tantalizing visuals. The Italian landscapes are real visionary treat and the historical settings are what makes this movie more historical in details. Everything looks real in terms of locations, the castles, the towns, the ruins and the courtyards all look and feel authentic. The visuals all groovy looking as every shot has a postcard image that will make your eyes water. The dawns and dusk of the Italian countryside will likely take your breath away.Of course the beautiful setting has a weakness and that is the setting looks too immaculate. Granted this is a fairytale and nothing has to be real, however being that this is a medieval period piece film, I expected some rough roads, bumpy trails and maybe a little bit of mud. Everything looks too pristine, the buildings look way too maintained and for a rural area, the countryside looks way too clean, even the costumes look prim and prop. I am a neat freak in real life, but for a medieval picture I was expecting a bit of filth to match the period.Another big turn-off is the musical score selection that Donner provides is quite odd. I would of expected like a symphony orchestra background that would go well with the setting of the movie. Instead, Donner gives us a 1980's sounding score complete with synthesizers and electric guitars almost like what Ridley Scott did with the movie Legend. It just doesn't sit well compared to the authentic backdrop of the settings and loses the effect of the story marginally.The casting choices are virtually spot on, especially the casting of Rutger Hauer and a young Michelle Pfeiffer. Hauer was best performer in the movie. He looked really awesome in that Jedi like robe along with a traditional heroic costume and a red lining and a black steed to ride on making this man look and appear like he's well off. Hauer was quite handsome in his costume.Pfeiffer is quite convincing for the time period with her milky white skin complexion, her gorgeous blonde hair, and the most gorgeous blue eyes to ever hit the screen. She has the physicality of an angel that fits right with Hauer's knightly appearance. They make the perfect couple and they seem very believable that they could transform into a wolf and a hawk (Ladyhawke...need I say more?) The biggest miscast in this movie is the casting choice of Matthew Broderick. He was the major Achilles heel in this movie. His demeanour is annoying along with that mousy squeaky voice and constant nervous ramblings is more appalling than nails on a chalkboard. I just wanted to wanted to ring his neck for every time he made those stupid facial expressions.The plot needs time to adjust. I mean Navarre (Hauer) is a wolf at night and Isadeau (Pfeiffer) is a hawk by day, leaves little for explanation. There are no strange transformations and the characters just fade into their animal forms which is quite captivating in its low-key perspective. I thought the plot was overdo because the story is very thin, it's really about Navarre getting revenge on the Bishop (John Wood) for putting an evil curse on him. That being said I think that in this two hour film, there's a substantial amount of padding when there really didn't need that much and it can be mundane at times making it feel all style and no substance at times. Which isn't bad but some editing could've been needed in some areas.Overall it is a gorgeous movie with a picturesque setting and all the Italian landscapes are very sublime. It might be too clean at times but that's just me nitpicking. The performances were pretty good especially from Hauer and Pfeiffer and look and act like the fit the time period of this movie. Nobody would expect this to be a Richard Donner film.

Ladyhawke (1985) fills a gap in my memory as possession (VHS cassette) that I highly valued because this was beautiful movie even for the criteria of long gone 1980s. Yes, the cast was marvelous - Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Broderick performed at the prime of their artistic potential. Their films from the 80s remain classic in the History of Hollywood Cinema (every which one of them, I wouldn't enumerate them). Yes, Richard Lethalweapon Donner remains iconic figure in Hollywood film making. Yes, music score from Alan Parsons was excellent electronic achievement. In that way of thinking it is not strange that there is little philosophy here to add and send it on a mail list.But something that was bugging me lately (that is, not only for this Movie but numerous others) comprise the lack of validity for the screenplay. Scenario doesn't come just as a story devoid of time and place. Unfortunately, this is how many of contemporary movies are being shot - you have got yourself a fantastic script; director of photography gets filming locations that fulfill the criteria of the budget and visionary from the side of producers; finally the film director stitches all that notches in coherent tale. Is that all really or there is something else. What about the Turkish reading of the whole responsible staff? I doubt whether even a dozen people concerning about working title should ever worry about this. After all they work with ready recipes and don't re-tell Grimms' Fairy Tales. This is where I want to put my emphasis.Now everybody knows who Grimm Brothers are or at least have heard about their stories for children c. 1812. Everything else in order, Ladyhawke (1985) comes as a fairy tale exactly from this imaginary domain (but not exclusively mentioned in the screenplay). For instance, another similar (Gothic) movie produced at about the same time and place furnishes much more details on the underlying historical period - cf., The Name of the Rose (1986) based on Umberto Eco's novel. All that said, it remains the much more simplified task to try to decode the whereabouts of Ladyhawke.I did some Turkish (uninitiated) reading on Europe's Medieval History. Particularly interesting key-point with regard to the tract of land in Northern Italy where our story is supposed to evolve proved to be Lotharingia - firstly a Kingdom in Charlemagne's Empire, then abolished by Neurasia (today France) and Austrasia (today Germany) to an extent that it remained only as a Duchy of Lotharingia in Otto the Great Empire (First Reich). Today this territory corresponds to an extended Netherlands (plus Cologne municipality with Aachen where originally Charlemagne resided and was crowned by the Pope). Those are history facts that any European should know if we consider some common future on this continent. Then we should arrive at the direct consequences of two World Wars in 20th century which are banal enough to reiterate here.I want to finish my commentary with some scattered notes that I collected during my Turkish reading. These European territories which lie in North-West corner (sic!) of the continental plate were once upon a time covered with thick forests. Not joking neither telling Grimms' Fairy Tales. There were only Kings, Bishops, Knights, Ladies and Sorcerers. Nothing essentially from Church or Economy systems that we perceive now-a-days existed straightforward. Everything from material and cultural heritage is many times restored to hide the traces of obliteration. See the Romanesque Cathedral at end of Ladyhawke where final combat with the Evil Bishop partakes. Judge Yourself!

When guards attempt to hunt Philippe down, he is rescued by Etienne Navarre (Rutger Hauer), the former Captain of the Guards, who was banished to live the rest of his days with a curse placed on himself and the Lady Isabeau Asurre (Michelle Pfeiffer) by the lustful Bishop who made a deal with the devil to make the curse, when Isabeau refused his attentions.The curse turns Navarre into a wolf by night and Isabeau into a hawk by day, making it impossible for them to be lovers, or to even to touch or remember each other. After saving Philippe's life, Navarre encourages him to help Navarre find a way back into Aquila so he can kill the Bishop and break the curse.This movie is fantasy at its very best. An excellent movie should move you so that you become part of the story, everything else fades away while you are in it. This movie does that by combining good actors, a good story line and great music. I would recommend this story to everyone!

His little talks to God were cute and his character was just really sweet. The only complaint I had was the 80's pop music. It clashed so much with landscape and the story.

There's not much to add to other reviews other than every scene is rendered as an oil painting in terms of shot setup. Considering Vittorio Storaro nationality and training, that's no surprise, as the lighting here melds superbly with the choice of lenses, giving us a kind of anachronistic feel--as if we've been transported to medieval General-Fantasy-Europe (specifically the Italian Alps) to witness a fairy tale unfold.Vittorio Storaro shows us late evenings. He shows us night time. He shows us morning. And that's just the director of photography at work, following Richard Donner's superb direction. Richard Donner is one of my all time favorite directors, and given a virtuoso like Vittorio Storaro for his project, could you expect anything less?The casting respectable. We have marquis players thesping the rolls, which was done for market draw. Not a problem as they do their job well and then some. More tailored actors for the roll might have helped the film artistically, but would have held back a better commercial success. Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeifer play supporting rolls to Broderick's main character. Their story is the focus, but it's told through the eyes of Broderick's medieval lad gone astray, but who finds that his life has now a higher purpose.IF I had one critique with the film, then it's the music. Again, rendered for a 80s late teen to 30s market, we get some pop rock guitar rifts mixed in with some traditional music from the high middle ages. Rescoring this film would be an interesting project.Another artifact is the lack of editing. We see mostly secondary masters with some coverage added. Again, thanks to the excellent cinematography we're treated to visuals that need no rapid fire cuts.The effects shots are done via editing and old fashioned transitions. There are no process shots here, and certainly no CGI (thank goodness). I'm not sure Vittorio Storaro's shots would benefit from modern day CGI. He's still around. I may write him a letter asking.All in all a really fine film. If you can tolerate the music, and get by some of the costuming liberties, then it should prove to be a good night's watch with the loved one of your choice.Enjoy.

The villains in this film, particularly the Bishop, could have been better developed. Much criticism has been leveled against the film's soundtrack. It wasn't as appropriate as the symphonic scores of other fantasy films and sometimes was awkward, but overall I didn't mind it and even enjoyed it at times.

Unlike so many of my childhood favorites, this one still captivates me.A lot of people complain about the soundtrack, and I really can't see why. Yes, it's not from the time period. Yes, there are some synthesizers used. But when you look at how it fits into the movie as a whole, it's really quite beautiful. I think period authenticity is a lot less important than how the music is used. There are a couple of places where it's a bit too heavy, but even watching it specifically to listen to how the score fits I still think it's great.As for the special effects of Isabeau and Navarre's transformations, they're really relatively sparing. They focus mainly on the eyes and their change from human to animal. It's more about what they're feeling in these moments than fancy graphics. Because of this, the effects don't appear as dated as some older films.I love the story, it always chokes me up. For anyone who doesn't know Isabeau and Navarre fell in love, but the Bishop of Aquila wanted her for himself. When they fled, he made a pact with the devil to curse them. During the day, Isabeau is a hawk and Navarre a man. At night, he becomes a wolf and she a woman. As Phillipe says always together, eternally apart. The story has gorgeous scenery, realistic action, and almost flawless acting (though there are a couple of places where Michelle Pfeiffer makes me wince).Aside from the story, I think the realistic details of the film are one reason I love it so much. You can hear Navarre's leather outfit creaking, especially toward the end. When one of the bishop's guards falls into a moat, it's dark and full of leaves. The chain-mail clinks, the swords genuinely clash, the horses' hooves clatter on the cobblestones. This film is gritty and realistic while remaining romantic and beautiful as well.

Captain Etienne Navarre (Rutger Hauer) solicits the help of witty, quick-tongued Phillipe Gaston (aka The Mouse) (Matthew Broderick), a young fugitive who knows the way to the castle. Together, they are going to rescue his beloved Isabeau (Michelle Pfieffer) and break the curse of the Bishop (John Wood) that keeps them apart. That is, according to the curse, Navarre transforms into a wolf by night, and Isabeau a hawk by day. They are never simultaneously, as the Bishop wanted after Isabeau refused his requests that she be with him.Aside from an entertaining story, Rutger Hauer is perfect as the often-stubborn Navarre. And, Matthew Broderick's dialog offers appropriately timed moments of comic relief, a nice contrast to Navarre's cold demeanor. The scenery is breathtaking as well. As other viewers have suggested, Donner did make some odd choices (the most mentioned element, perhaps, being the soundtrack), but overall, you should expect something good.

I watched it expecting a nice mediaeval-fantasy, but I ended up laughing the whole way through.The plot is, to say the least, predictable. Characterizations (with the exception of Matthew Broderick as the Mouse) are extremely poor. The romance between Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer's characters is designed to tug at viewers heartstrings (a passionate love, a jealous rival, an evil curse, etc), but we never really care about either of them or their fate together. This is due to the poor characterizations and the fact that we can guess how the film will end within the first twenty minutes.The fight scenes, promised to be action-packed and exciting, are some of the worst I've ever seen. Even villains aren't that stupid.In terms of historical accuracy (even for a fantasy)...well, don't even get me started.

The filmmakers did a very good job of creating an exquisite medieval atmosphere.

Then the thumping music started up and yanked me out of the past and plunked me down right back into the 20th century. What were they thinking?  That said, it had a very good story and wonderful performances by the three leads. Rutger Hauer's intense presence, which leaves me unsure if I should trust him or fear him, adds just the right amount of tension to his scenes. Matthew Broderick plays his part beautifully, and comes of as charming without looking like he's trying too hard, and Michelle Pfeiffer was exquisite. Her presence and beauty enhance the film's magical story.  It's too bad the action scenes are staged terribly, and the climax is just clumsy. This could have been a much better movie. (I'd love to see a good remake.)  Credit for the very original story should go to the first screenwriter, Edward Khmara. Contrary to the claims of the film's marketing crew, it's not an 800 year old story, or an ancient legend, it's the product of Edward Khmara's imagination, and he should be given proper credit for it.  ** SPOILER WARNING **  What were they thinking showing us a full moon just days before a total eclipse?

I have fond memories of watching this movie, it wasn't too scary or difficult to follow.  My fondness for the film grew over the years (when my girlish crush on a young Matthew Broderick became a teenaged crush on the handsome Rutger Hauer).

I'm only mentioning this because I checked other people's reviews of this film and a majority of them are about the music.     For those Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer fans out there, a word of warning  this really is Matthew Broderick's film.

Matthew Broderick is charming much of the time in a role which requires charm -- often a recipe for disaster.  Here, by and large, it works.  Pfieffer and Hauer are servicable.  Some of the minor performers are grating, however.What's wrong oh, Lord, where to start?  The music, since it provides the first truly teeth-grinding moment.  The inventive opening credits are rolling along, nice and evocative, and the music is dim and unobtrusive.  Suddenly, this horrid contemporary studio pop kicks in, and my first thought was, This is going to be a long movie.  Then I saw the Alan Parsons credit and I groaned.  I used to like Parsons' better stuff, but his worst is pretty unlistenable.  Chalk up the score to Ladyhawke among his worst.  He creates a theme for the movie and hammers it again and again -- for the first third of the film, with very little variation.  And it's so far forward in the mix, I had to wonder -- Richard Donner was proud of this?  Or the studio?  Who, exactly, thought this worked?Onward.  The script isn't very well fleshed out, and the surprises -- few and far between -- aren't particularly thrilling.  Some moments are incomprehensible -- a guard searching for Broderick's character sees him about to raise the grate and enter a cathedral, where he can easily be captured; the guard steps on Broderick's fingers, however, allowing him to fall back into the labyrinth where he can now afford escape.  Um, huh?Steven Soderbergh is currently taking a old dud and reimagining it as a new piece, which is really the thing to do.  Leave alone our Psychos, our Rashomans, our Shops Around The Corners.

What were they thinking adding a lot of bad 80s synth music with drum machines to a medieval love story? Wanting to get away from the big orchestral sound (equally inappropriate in a way) that one associates with Hollywood mythological films was no doubt a laudable idea, and Vangelis had proved, in Chariots of Fire, that one could use modern sounds to create an epic feel, but the music here is mostly so unremittingly bad, and jarringly used that one has to scratch one's head about it.Otherwise the film is very hit and miss. The concept of two lovers who can only touch momentarily at dusk is truly great, Shakespearean in scope and the two lovers are well played by Hauer and Pfeiffer. Matthew Broderick is sadly not up to the task allotted to him however. And apart from the doomed lovers, the plot is full of familiar medieval clich√©s, a good thief, hissible villains and the like.Worth watching but best to turn the sound down during the musical interludes.

LadyHawke was in my shortlist based on a reasonable IMDb score and the cast.Ladyhawke is a fantasy romance set in medieval France. It has a decent plot basis that I won't reveal.The cast sounds good enough but it's a bad movie overall due to flimsy direction of character and story. Often a good score can disguise a bad movie but it's the worst it could be, of a very typical 80's trend and not at all complementing of the medieval era.For the fault of direction it's perhaps unfair to be critical of the cast...But if I may; though Hauer looks the part of a dark hero, this is essentially a romantic tale and his rugged air of cynicism is a poor match for the role.Broderick, and his medieval clippered haircut is, as expected, mousy, gormless-cute and effecting a confused accent.Pfeiffer is beautiful as always and plays what she's given well enough, but how she got a blow-dryed conditioned hairstyle in that era is beyond me. She shows her stuff better in Stardust! And the other minor parts John Wood is interesting as the bishop though the script for him trails off disappointingly. And Leo McQuern as Father Imperious is the most well-rounded of the lot.The star of this film is the animal handling and the animals themselves, and the production value location filming.The score is abysmal, but check the other reviews for more info. The 80s synth-pop doesn't fit - I could only get through by laughing it off! If I hadn't seen better quality of a similar ilk maybe I could see Ladyhawke more favourably. But Princess Bride this isn't, and Beastmaster is better. Ladyhawke just doesn't tie together well.So Ladyhawke hasn't made my list of films to see again, but for your info neither has Starman (Sci-Fi), Perhaps it's as re-watchable as Hawk the Slayer. For me, that's not saying much. Take my review as lightly as you like.

After falling in with Matthew Broderick as a comedy sidekick, steps finally start to be taken towards lifting the enchantment.There's quite a lot to like here - Hauer and Pfeiffer are both very good (and Pfeiffer has seldom been more beautiful, which is saying something). Broderick never looks as if he feels comfortable, however (although Leo McKern is his usual wonderful self), and John Wood doesn't seem able to convey villainy - he always looks as if he has a misplaced smirk on his face.The period feel is good and the scenery is lovely (as is the photography of the hawk). The idea is a good one, albeit the execution never really excites as it should.But there are two things which mar this movie. One is the fact that it really needed the transformations to be rather more convincing than they are. One accepts that CGI/morphing wasn't available in 1985, but the transformations are nevertheless rather undercooked.And the other is the music - every now and then an upbeat electric guitars/drums arrangement kicks in and it simply doesn't fit, to the extent that it takes you out of the film.

But the whole movie is quite charming and entertaining and tells a beautiful fantasy story filled with clich√©s. The young and charismatic Matthew plays a nice role as a naive and annoying thief, Rutger Hauer incorporates the tough guy waiting for his vengeance and Michelle Pfeiffer the charming young lady. The key message of the film that one has never to give up and wait for a good twist or idea to solve one's problems instead of using violence is a typical, but nice idea. The ancient traitor who wants to correct his errors in an innersight experience is a nice gadget of this film, too. The films has a quite large type of genres, beginning with fantasy elements (the curse of the hawk and wolf), romantic elements (theor faithful love), dramatic elements (as the hawk is heavily injured and as the wolf seems to commit a huge mistake), action elements (as the young thief escapes from prison and military) and philosophical elements (love, religion, faith) with some interesting twists (the change of mood of the monk, the eclipse).The only negative elements are that the movie deals with a lot of clich√©s, that the end is quite predictable. Another bad point is that the film has been turned in 1985, but that the graphics are rather old fashioned and that there is a lack of special effects or interesting director's ideas. This lack of ideas makes the film quite ordinary which is quite sad as the actors are doing a good job and as the whole thing could have been better as many interesting basis elements are there but not no profound or surprising aspects based on it. It all rests quite superficial, very diversified, but with no special concentration on one of the different genre elements. A bit less diversity, but a more profound analysis could have made the film a lot better.All in all, the movie is quite entertaining and is especially interesting for its young main actors who have all become well known actors in their later careers. If you're seeking for a really innovating blockbuster, you may be disappointed, as it is a very traditional and old fashioned fantasy movie. I would recommend you to watch this and to have a nice two hours with it but not buy it.

It takes the help of a young thief, and a disgraced monk to finally reunite them and free them from their ordeal.The story is first rate, with excellent characters and memorable scenes. The casting is flawless. Matthew Broderick is both funny and charming as the thief, while Rutger Hauer is suitably noble as the hero. Michelle Pfeiffer was at the height of her beauty (still looks pretty good today) and is a vision that would capture the heart of an knight, thief, bishop, or monk. leo McKern is equally good as the disgraced monk who betrayed the lovers to his master.The costumes are excellent, with a unique design for the weapons and armor. It gives the film a timelessness, like it could be the middle ages or some lost era.If their is one flaw, it is the music. The use of more contemporary synth music is very jarring at times. A more symphonic piece would have been more in keeping with the grandeur.Ladyhawke is the rare film that appeals to fans of heroic adventure and romance.

Ladyhawke is a pleasant enough distraction, in spite of its flaws. The story centers on brooding knight Navarre (Rutger Hauer) and beautiful Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose love for each other incurred the wrath of the Bishop of Aquila (John Wood), who wanted Isabeau for himself. Driven by hellish rage and jealousy, he places them under a cruel curse. Doomed to be always together, eternally apart, Isabeau transforms into a hawk during the day, while Navarre takes the form of a wolf at night. Their only hope is to achieve the impossible goal of confronting the Bishop while both in their human form. Navarre recruits the help of motor-mouthed pickpocket Phillippe (Matthew Broderick) to lead the way to Aquila, where for better or worse, destiny waits. The movie boasts beautiful scenery, astounding action sequences and fine performances. Hauer is in a pleasing change of pace from his usual, Christopher Walken-esquire roles. He's dashing, complicated, and even a bit sexy. Broderick is amusing, though his neurotic and contemporary quips threaten to grate (and what's with that accent?). Pfeiffer never looked more beautiful, but for the leading lady role, her part is surprisingly thankless. Isabeau is much too passive and has too little screen time. One major complaint? The movie forgets to show, not tell. A flashback showing the Navarre and Isabeau before the curse would have been extremely welcome, but instead we are given a rushed explanation by Imperious (Leo McKern), an old friend of the two lovers. And don't get me started on that embarrassing, over synthesized music score that would be more at home on Miami Vice that a Richard Donner fantasy. But other than that, Ladyhawke is good, brisk entertainment, and certainly worth a look. Donner does pull out all the stops to make a truly entertaining fairy tale, so you've got to admire his efforts. And compared to recent, disastrous attempts at fantasy (The Brothers Grimm, anyone?), you could certainly do worse.

Other fantasy films, like 'The Dark Crystal', 'Willow', and 'The Princess Bride', are great and they do NOT have a pop score. Ladyhawke belongs to the former category. It's not perfect, but it almost gets there.The performances in this tale of love are great. Action-adventure is not a genre Matthew Broderick inhabits comfortably (see his awful acting in the 1998 'Godzilla' for proof), but he is very charming and often funny here. Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfieffer make a very good pair of doomed lovers, and Hauer is particularly focused and intense. There is an almost unbearably sad scene where the two lovers almost touch at sunrise, and Hauer's howl of pain at the end of the scene caps it perfectly.

Rutger Hauer is brilliant as ever as Navarre, the late Leo McKern is great as the fallen priest who is given a chance at redemption and John Wood is a truly hateful villain as the corrupt Bishop.  A young Michelle Pfeiffer has very little to do in the film, but still manages to shine. POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Hauer and Pfeiffer are lovers who have been cursed by the evil Bishop.  By day, Pfeiffer turns into a hawk and by night, Hauer becomes a wolf.  This is because the Bishop loves Pfieffer and swore that no man would have her if he could not. Broderick is a young pickpocket who has managed to escape from the hellish dungeons of the French city of Aquila (apparently an impossible thing to do.).  Hauer therefore believes that Broderick can help him get into the city so he may kill the Bishop and break the curse.  But McKern knows the real way in which to break the curse and enlists Broderick's help in trying to convince the hard-headed Navarre to listen. As well as being a thief, Broderick is a compulsive liar, but as the film goes on, he lies to both Hauer and Pfeiffer about how they have said how much they love each other.  To be fair, he does this to bring them both hope that they may be reunited.  So, it is he who is able to help both of them.The picture is filmed in beautiful countryside in Italy and there are subtly-done effects for the transformations which are fantastic.  I am one of the few people on IMDB who liked the score by The Alan Parsons Project.  I guess people thought it was inappropriate considering the Medieval setting of the film, but I think that the music compliments the action perfectly, and the 'Love Theme' which is played throughout the film and during the credits is a lovely piece of music.This is a great film and should not be missed!

It is one of the Basque lands.  My theory is that Etienne was an exiled nobleman it's a long story, but Goliath is too expensive to belong to anyone less than a nobleman.)There has been a lot of criticism of the soundtrack, but I think it was wonderful.  The rhythms were very medieval in flavor, but having it scored for modern instruments was a risky choice.  I like the way it worked.  The use of continuo was very effective.

Hauer was marvelous, Matthew Broderick was marvelous, Michelle Pfeiffer was marvelous, and the rest of the cast.....There was a spate of fantasy adventures that appeared about the same time as Ladyhawke.  I don't remember any of them.  And, significantly, this is the only DVD I own, even though I don't have a DVD player yet. "},{"Title":"Naive romance at its best! Worst/best soundtrack ever","Date":"30 September 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" I must be a nutter, since I could see this one each and every night, and every single time I watch it, I have to cry at the passage where they almost touch and at the end. Tss. Doctors would diagnose me as a naive romantic, and, indeed, this is exactly the film for me and any other courtly love adoring pathological melancholic (note I also like Zeffirelli's 1968 Romeo and Juliet and even Hugh Hudson's 1984 Greystoke Tarzan film(!) - I even, pardon me Lord, sat through Titanic and actually liked it, though Di Caprio was way too young).But it's hard to get to the crying point, especially since, as it has been abundantly pointed out by others, the soundtrack is mindbogglingly bad. Especially the up-beat pop tune with which the film opens (I mean, Christ, what was the point of making a mysterious opening if it was going to be spoiled by such a score?) Then it becomes clear we're in the middle of the eighties here, you know, that era where more aerobic videos got sold/hired than regular films. They obviously wanted to make this more of a film for a teenage audience that had gotten used to The Breakfast Club, St Elmo's Fire and other stronzo. And it returns again and again! Especially the action scenes (during the first half) get utterly ruined by it, though their fairy-tale aspect gets strengthened. These are the ruined scenes Philippe's escape from the moment he falls in the water, his & Navarre's first fight with the Bishop's soldiers at the inn, the fight at the village where Ladyhawke gets wounded, and some scenes in between.What made me cry, then? First, the beautiful images! Astonishingly, for a story in which day and night ar so essential, you are very often left wondering when it is exactly dark or when it is light. You might see this as a flaw, but no. It's caused by the very efficient use of colour lenses, blue during several 'night' scenes, though I think they were filmed during daytime, and orange/sepia/red during the most of the day scenes. It makes the trees look aflame, and puts a magical atmosphere over the whole film. See it in widescreen and a pristine copy, or else you'll lose a lot of the visual quality.The second tear-provoking element was... well... the soundtrack. The main theme, though successfully destroyed in the opening track, is simply beautiful, and summarizes the hope pouring out of this film (here goes the romantic...). At several crucial points in the film, this wonderfully melancholic tune comes in, springing from a more dark, brooding theme.The third reason were the actors. Though the acting might not have been perfect (good fantasy does not necessarily require that - see Conan), the casting was! Hauer is a wonderfully heroic Etienne de Navarre, and Michelle Pfeiffer, with her unworldly overwhelming beauty was the ideal Isabeau d'Anjou. She was 27 at the time, and combined with her relatively short-cut hair (also see Into The Night from the same year, fans!) she is just THE princess for whom we all want to get on our horse and fight the bad guy. The real charm of the film comes from the duo Broderick/McKern, who add exactly the playful quality which makes the drama stand out and not slide off into cheap, implausible, heavy melancholy. Apparently they still didn't think that was enough, hence the soundtrack... John Wood gives us a lovely caricature of the evil Bishop - the man breathes evil.The fourth reason was the happy ending. I'm a sucker for happy endings. A good film seems pointless to me if there isn't a happy ending to it. Don't misunderstand me Romeo and Juliet also has a happy ending (they both die, so no one's left to mourn the other). I don't mean the traditional Hollywood happy ending is really my cup of tea. It's just that, hey, after a long road of suffering, the guy has to walk away with the broad in the end, no? At least, it's obligatory in any naive romantic fantasy. It's what its all about - the essence of Courtly Love.Superb.

Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer star as the lovers, Etienne Navarre and Isabeau Dante, victims of the wanton desires of a Bishop (John Wood), who covets Isabeau for himself.  And if he cannot have her, the Bishop decrees that no man shall, and casts a spell upon them which transforms them at every sunrise and sunset, Navarre destined to be a man by day, but a wolf by night; Isabeau, by night a woman, but during the daylight taking the form of a hawk.  Unable to break the curse, they are able to glimpse one another as they really are only during the fleeting moments of their transition, and so they live-- traveling the countryside always together yet apart, searching for a way to lift the spell and become whole again.  	Hopeless as it all seems, they go on; and one day a young man enters their lives, a petty thief named Phillipe Gaston (Matthew Broderick), also known as `The Mouse,' who through a twist of fate just may become their salvation.  Joining them on their journey, Phillipe is able to bring Navarre and Isabeau, if not comfort, at least hope.  Hope for a better tomorrow, when at last they may truly be together.	Romantic to the max and in every sense of the word, Donner presents this fanciful tale beautifully, and in a way that makes it engaging and timeless.  This story is a vision realized, one that will surely touch the romantic in even the most jaded of individuals, because everyone has known this kind of love and longing, if not in reality, then at least in the realm of the imagination.  And those who have ever suffered loss or have known sorrow will be especially moved by it.  Drawing upon his own artistic wherewithal, Donner has crafted a film with universal appeal, tempering the romance with just enough humor to offset the drama, while blending it with a dash of action, mystery and suspense that keeps a thread of tension alive from beginning to end.  It helps, of course, that beyond Donner's consummate skill as a storyteller he had a terrific cast with which to work, and with whom he was able to conjure and cast a spell of his own.	There is but one word to describe Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Isabeau, and that is `Exquisite.'  Of beauty, grace, poise and charm; all of the above.  She embodies all of these qualities and more in Isabeau, giving a sensuous and alluring performance that should have earned her resounding acclaim.  Why it did not is anyone's guess.  One possibility is that it had to do with the decade in which this film was made (it was released in 1985), born as it was in the middle of an era dominated by action movies and teen angst.  Given the sensibilities of today's audiences, however, who seem to be embracing the more imaginative offerings like `Harry Potter,' `Lord of the Rings' and the off-beat fairy tale, `Shrek,' and in light of the unprecedented success of `Titanic,' I feel an argument could be made that this film was some fifteen years or so ahead of it's time.  If released today, chances are it would enjoy a significantly greater success.  Indeed, it may yet find new life on video/DVD, conducive as it is to the tastes of viewers today.	This is certainly one of Rutger Hauer's most memorable roles, and he is perfectly cast as the dashing soldier, Navarre.  Heroic and romantic, this is a character not unlike others he's done (he did a variation of Navarre this same year in `Flesh and Blood'), but this is the definitive portrayal.  It's refreshing to see him in a role like this, as he tends to gravitate toward characters with a darker side, villains like John in `The Hitcher,' or the anti-hero, Roy, in `Blade Runner.'  Here, astride his horse and wielding a sword apparently wrought from the same steel as Excalibur, he cuts quite a bold figure, enhanced by the depth of his eyes and a determined attitude, especially in the final scene in which he at last confronts his nemesis.  And there's a definite chemistry between Hauer and Pfeiffer that makes this story all the more enticing.	As Phillipe, Matthew Broderick gives an agreeable performance, creating a character who is not only ingratiating, but who serves as a sort of conduit, moving the story along while offering some fresh perspectives on the situation at hand along the way.  Broderick lends something of a contemporary sensibility to The Mouse, who is reminiscent of C-3PO in `Star Wars,' as he adopts a rather wry and amusingly stoic attitude that makes his bemused soliloquies especially engaging.  It's a solid performance, but one for which Broderick-- like Pfeiffer and Hauer-- has never received proper acknowledgement.  	The supporting cast includes Leo McKern (Imperius), Ken Hutchison (Marquet), Alfred Molina (Cezar) and Giancarlo Prete (Fornac).  Encompassing a number of genres, from romance to fantasy/drama to action/adventure, `Ladyhawke' is an ambitious, entertaining film that has yet to find it's audience-- or perhaps it's the other way around; because it's available and just waiting to be spirited away into living rooms and video/DVD players everywhere.  Which is exactly what it will do to those lucky enough to connect with it, because this is one that will sweep you away to another time and another place, beyond the threshold of the here and now and into that land of enchantment, wherever it may be.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this 9/10.

Now this could be considered surprising, considering the majority of the cast.  Michelle Pfeiffer's acting skills are normally strained by the simplest of roles, but she does an admirable job here (though please note that she is a hawk for most of the movie).  This has to be the best work I've ever seen Rutger Hauer do, edging out his performance as Roy Batty in Blade Runner just on the amount of screen time he got here.  And this is about the only movie I can say that I enjoyed having Matthew Broderick in, since I found Ferris Bueller disappointing and Godzilla vastly overrated. Two of the true highlights of this movie (beyond the enchanting script, cinematography, and story) are Leo McKern and the music of Alan Parsons.  I've never seen McKern give anything close to a bad performance, and anyone ever remotely familiar with the Alan Parsons Project will recognize the songwriter's work on the score, which helps an excellent movie flow even better.Ladyhawke is a fantasy that should not be missed.

What scuppers the movie most obviously is the soundtrack, one of the most dreadful and dreadfully inappropriate ever created, its soft-centered, happy-clumpy optimism quite out of kilter with what the director seems at least to be attempting in the evocation of a quite dark atmosphere, part medieval history, part fairy tale, part heroic-romantic legend.Sadly, nothing else about it quite comes off either.  Christian Slater is terrible in a bland part which should have been a support role at best; the fact that it's been made the lead shows everyone's lack of confidence in the whole project.  Rutger Hauer is pretty useful - his natural intensity of gaze is used to good purpose - though he frankly seems a touch chubby for a part that calls for a certain angularity of figure; if he lost a few pounds he'd be great.  Michelle Pfeiffer is only called on to look melancholy and to look pretty, both of which she manages perfectly well, but somebody should have taken her hairdresser out to a nice lunch somewhere and explained very carefully and very kindly that this is thirteenth-century France and not 1980's Manhattan.  As with the music, lots of thoughtless false notes in the visual presentation counteract everyone's best efforts. John Wood is superb as ever, in an underwritten part; like Hauer he acts mostly with his eyes, quite often simply by not moving them; he recognizes that in the movies, a certain stillness of gaze is often the best way to create tension.  The director, on the other hand, doesn't.What makes this movie so frustrating is that it has so much more to work with than your average fantasy film.  The basic premise - that a pair of lovers have been separated by a curse which makes her a hawk by day, him a wolf by night, so that it's only at dawn (and presumably sunset) that they can see each other in human form, and even then they can never quite touch before the transformations are complete - has a Tristan-like simplicity and tragic purpose; personally I'd have made them immortal, so that they could have been in this state for rather longer than the two years allowed by the script, and have no hope even of the release of death, to enhance the mythic feel... but I can see there might be disadvantages to that, as it would probably mean making the Faustian bishop deathless too, and eventually one presumes somebody would notice.  Perhaps ten years would do as a compromise. After all, Rutger Hauer looks middle-aged here, and Michelle Pfeiffer is probably better looking now than then, so an actress of her age would have a certain extra stature in the role.  However, I guess it's too late now.

If you look at other 80s fantasy films, there is some much much better stuff out there (Krull, Labyrinth, Dune, Clash of the Titans and Willow for example) with higher production values and more character involvement. The main special effect (for the transformation scenes) is a kind of half fade to the sunset and some blurred images.

As much as I hate to join the bandwagon, I have to say it  Watching Robin Hood Prince of Theives, it occurs to me that many of the instruments used in Michael Kamen's fantastic score is very anachronistic with the early years of the new millennium, but somehow I don't care.  Assuming Middle Earth's evolution is similar to our world's, the LotRs score is anachronistic (then again, who knows in the fantasy world), but still, I don't care.  That score works. Watching Young Guns with its electric guitars, yes it does bother me, but somehow LadyHawke's score one-ups it.  As I wrote for Young Guns, somewhere between complete timeline-accuracy and 20th century is a happy medium.  LadyHawke does not hit it.      The premise has the potential for a classic fantasy fairy tale &#150; a love that can never be &#150; something that tugs at the heart strings; unfortunately, like the music, most of LadyHawke never quite hits its mark, which is rather surprising coming from Richard Donner who already gave us the Omen, Superman, The Toy, and he would go on to make more great films like the Lethal Weapon series, Goonies, Maverick, and Scrooged.The action scenes are subpar, especially by Donner's own standards, but the strength of this film lay in the quieter, subtler moments.  And threw all of its faults, Donner does show the he hasn't forgotten the craft of filmmaking as the film truly explores the curse of the two lovers . . . especially when they can catch only fleeting glimpses of each other.  The dramatic scenes have a masterful composition and pace, it's just a shame that the movie suffers from so many trips and stumbles and simply can't meet up with the poetic standard the dramatic end creates.        Still, even my least favorite Donner film contains some great sequences, and I feel is worth a viewing or two.  LadyHawke is far from my favorite film; however, if asked for a top ten list of emotional moments in cinematic history I'm sure LadyHawke has a scene that would be heavily considered.

For example Rutger Hauer¬¥s character, the knight NAVARRE, rides a farm horse, not the usual heros pure breed horse that we see in Hollywood adventures. And besides being the hero, he treats everyone wich is inferior to his condition like dirt. He¬¥s very arrogant to the peasants for example. Altough we can see he¬¥s not a bad guy, he¬¥s just a man of its time.  All this is historicaly very acurate, which for a change is something nice to see in a knights movie or in an american movie as a matter of fact.

Even the better overall performances are at times pulled out of character leaving the viewer to wonder if that could possibly have been the best take available, or why there wasn't another, or in some cases, why that shot was even necessary.There was a lot of animal wrangling involved here, if I'm to give the director an excuse for why too little time was spent on the human characters, but basically my disappointment comes down to Donner's cheap sensibilities and distance from the material.The choice of music is entirely incongruous to the the story and setting, consistently pulling the viewer out of the experience and reminding them that they are watching a film from the mid-80s that someone had hoped would be a big hit with the then new MTV generation.I'm just left feeling Ladyhawke could have been so much better and I wish it were. I really want to like this film, but find myself squirming and muttering, this is so bad.

Great story with something for everyone--romance, mystery, good vs. evil, fight sequences. Rutger Hauer should play more heroic roles like this one--strong yet sensitive. Michelle Pfieffer's Isabeau is wonderfully portrayed in understated elegance and beauty. And the character actors shine! Matthew Broderick is particularly superb.Unfortunately, the sound track detracts from the overall project. It is anachronistically incongruent with the film. This is an 80's version of Knight's Tale...except the great rock music is replaced with cheesy electronic keyboards. The idea behind the music is good but the instrumentation lacks fullness and depth. Watch the movie...put up with the sound track.

I have to hear Leo McKern say, What...Oh my God, is it Lent again, already? every Ash Wednesday before I go to worship. Apart from that, I love Matthew Broderick's ongoing conversation with God throughout the movie. To my lay mind this was his best work up to Glory. It was honest, funny, and great sermon material. Evil clerics are not my favorite villains in the world, but this movie does a good job of making the Bishop of Aquila villainous without making all of Christianity his partner in crime.

Basically thief Phillipe Gaston, aka The Mouse (Matthew Broderick) escapes the dungeons of Aquila, and he quickly groups with Captain Etienne Navarre (Rutger Hauer). The Captain has been hunted by the men of the Bishop of Aquila (John Wood) for two years, since he escaped with the lust of the Bishop, Lady Isabeau d'Anjou (Michelle Pfeiffer). Gaston finds out that both Navarre and Iasbeau are cursed, Navarre becoming a wolf by night, and Isabeau becoming a hawk by day, meaning they can never be with each other at the same time. Navarre is told by wise Father Imperius the Monk (The Omen's Leo McKern) that some day soon there will be day without night, and night without day, and he wonders what this mean. Eventually, Phillipe helps Navarre get back to the castle of Aquila for his battle with the Bishop, and the day/night thing is realised as an eclipse, and he and Isabeau have their curses lifted. Also starring Ken Hutchison as Marquet, Alfred Molina as Cezar, Giancarlo Prete as Fornac, Loris Loddi as Jehan and Alessandro Serra as Mr. Pitou. The performances are all good and fine, the special effects could have admittedly been a little better, but they don't spoil the adventure and romance elements at all, so a very worthwhile fantasy film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound. Very good!

I had to sit through this movie more than 20 times over the years, with my son, who used to dress up as Navarre when he was a child and watch it over and over again. If you didn't like this film, you're simply not a romantic or you're too inexperienced. Not all movies are supposed to be Citizen Kane. Some just tell a lovely story.

The plot is basically good, it's a good story, but the movie moves so slowly and I'm still not quite sure why the soldiers are spending so much effort trying to catch a petty thief. Costumes are nice, the lighting is terrible, so you can't really see the sets well enough to make a judgment. I really wish this had been better; maybe it's time for a remake.

The rest, a BLAH!","Date":"30 October 2009","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Ladyhawke is one of those water cooler conversation movies. It is always brought up as the film everyone has heard of, but rarely has been seen &#x96; and those that have seen it, worship the ground it steps on. Recently, Ladyhawke came across my player, and the opportunity to view this romantic fantasy was presented. Being an enormous fan of both The Princess Bride, Willow, and any of the reincarnations of Robin Hood, I was eager to add another title to the cannon. I wanted to be that guy that stood around the water cooler mentioning Ladyhawke to the utter confusion of my coworkers. Alas, my dreams were not that of Navarre or Isabeau, instead they were shattered as soon as the 2+ hours were completed. One can argue that this is a creative film; one could argue that the attraction between Hauer and Pfiffer was pure uncut chemistry, and one could argue that this is one of those forgotten classics that needs to be remembered. Disappointingly, that is not my reaction to this Richard Donner helmed behemoth. From a disastrous score (yep, jumping on that bandwagon) to cardboard acting to a underdeveloped plot, Ladyhawke failed to be anything more than just your average fantasy film.As the anticipation of angry faces on this review is realized, let me stress my points. Ladyhawke had quite a bit of potential. The idea was in place, the actors may have been able to handle their respective roles (at least Broderick could), and the director was the director of Superman. How could this project fail? At the beginning, there are no problems. Our introduction to Phillipe aka the Mouse felt genuine and unique. His escape from prison gave us a deeper insight to his character, his abilities, and his child-like motives. The opening scene felt like it was going to set the tone for the remainder of the film, and for the brief 15-minutes of Phillipe's escape, the level of enjoyment was up. Then, we are full-throttled into the world of Navarre, and our dynamic changes. This becomes less of a film about Phillipe, whom I was rooting for, but instead a substandard story about two star-crossed lovers that by magic cannot be together. Not only does our dynamic change (less Phillipe more quiet stares and gruff Hauer), but our story devolves into whatever Donner feels like throwing in on that day of shooting. Never are we introduced to magic within the world, but suddenly we are to believe that this mutation is plausible. There is realization that we are focusing on these two particular individuals, but we have no control group to experience the day-to-day of this world. Then, more intermediate characters are brought forward to build excitement, when honestly, the just build confusion. Question arise like was Cezar (Alfred Molina!) necessary, was John Wood as evil as predicted as the Bishop (need more!), and where does Imperius fit within everything. Ladyhawke felt like Donner wanted sweeping landscapes, star-crossed lovers, and an epic church battle, but cared nothing for what fell in between.With a lacking structure, we are forced to plop ourselves down and watch Hauer and Pfiffer carry this film &#x96; which is the bigger tragedy of this film because neither understand their roles not provide us with any definition. Isabeau, the less developed of the two, begins with mere stares, being more mysterious then passionate, and then, as we get closer to the finale, Donner makes us question her love for Hauer &#x96; which undermines this entire film. It makes us think that this is not eternal love, but merely a difficult circumstance. Hauer, more muscle than mind, fights his way through every battle using a sword the size of Phillipe. He is the most grounded of our group, and seems to be fighting more for their love than Pfiffer, but one needs to question when this epic battle didn't happen earlier. Why was Phillipe needed to spark this journey? If the love was that powerful, wouldn't Hauer have tried to meet with Imperius prior, fought the Bishop himself, and perhaps won his love himself? This piece just didn't fit &#x96; their characters wanted it, but why couldn't they do it? Finally, the music is horrible. Yes, the 80s were a time of synthesizers and imagination, but it just didn't fit with this genre of film. No matter how you put it, the music ruins the scenes in which we feel like the guards are going to break out in dance or have huge sunglasses. Donner failed in the world of sound for this film, and merely for that &#x96; I can see why Ladyhawke hasn't taken off further.Overall, not impressed. I began this film with hopes to discover a new fantasy to introduce to friends and be that guy around the water cooler. Ladyhawke is not that film. I believe it has been unjustly pushed into a cult category due to the popularity of its actors and possibly director. The acting is below par, the soundtrack is hilarious, and the story is as ramshackled as this disc. It is not a film to talk about, not a film to watch, nor a film to enjoy. This was a disappointment &#x96; I can applaud Matthew Broderick for not forcing me to throw the disc out after the first hour, but other than that it failed. Ladyhawke should be left in the darkened backlist of the local video store for years to come, only to be seen by some unsuspecting person hoping for the same quest I envisioned, but being disgusted again and again and again.Grade ** out of ***** "}{"Title":"Hawk shot down by meager concept and insufferable soundtrack","Date":"10 February 2008","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" With some judicious editing (maybe 30 minutes worth), a decent soundtrack and better acting by Matthew Broderick, Ladyhawke could have ended up as a nice little fairy tale worthy of a 5 or 6 rating. Alas it was never meant to be.As others have pointed out here, the soundtrack to this film was completely hopeless as the cheesy 80s synth sound did not mesh with a tale set in medieval times. The overall story of a romance interrupted by the spell of an evil bishop is a slight one--and the machinations of the protagonists moving toward the goal of lifting the curse becomes repetitive and tiresome after about an hour and a half. The entire scene where Matthew Broderick must save the wolf after he's fallen through the ice seems like unnecessary padding and slows the story down considerably. I wasn't impressed at all by the Hollywood leads in this movie. Matthew Broderick spends a lot of time talking to himself and his acting can best be described as 'goofy'. Similarly Michelle Pfeiffer has no charisma as the girl who's doomed to turn into a bird at the break of dawn. Not everything is her fault since the screenwriter has given her so little to do. The male principals in the film actually do a good job with the thin material they have to work with (John Wood, a noted Shakesperean actor, is particularly good as the nasty Bishop). Ladyhawke was filmed using real castles and church interiors and had the music been good, the atmosphere could have been much more affecting. Overall, Ladyhawke was a big disappointment and for those who have the DVD, I suggest swapping it for better fare on the internet swap sites such as titletrader.com and swapadvd.com.

It has not held up well.I won't spend a lot of time commenting on the horrific soundtrack as so many other reviewers have already done yeoman-like work in that regard. Suffice to say that Ladyhawke perfectly demonstrates how a score can really cripple a movie. Although, I do have to say that thankfully it is not a relentlessly constant presence, as some terrible scores have been in other films.However, there are other significant flaws with this movie that in my mind are actually worse than the soundtrack. For one, Rutger Hauer is miscast as the hero Navarre and is not nearly appealing enough. The main villain, by contrast, is not UNappealing enough, and as a result you don't have a good guy you root hard enough for nor a bad guy you root hard enough against.The action sequences are likewise tepid. In fact, I would have to say the most intense scene is not what is suppose to be the climactic fight scene at the end, but an earlier scene where Matthew Broderick's character is trying to save the wolf which has broken through the ice. That is actually the most intense and convincing scene in the entire movie.For me, the most poorly realized aspect of the film is the finale. There is a rather dull sword fight in a church between Navarre and the Bishop's captain of the guard. They appear to be doing nothing but trying to make a lot of noise with their swords. Meanwhile, all the extras in the church, as well as the evil bishop, Matthew Broderick's character, and his friend the monk, just stand around like a bunch of stiffs who weren't given any direction and don't know what to do with themselves. That unnatural behavior becomes even more discomfiting as Navarre has his confrontation with the bishop. Nobody comes forward and tries to restrain him, nobody makes cries of distress or outrage or anything. It's cringeingly awful!Then, when Rutger Hauer and Michele Pfeiffer's characters are finally reunited, it almost feels like director Donner just told them,Tell you what, just ad lib some emotion for about ten minutes, I'm going to go out and get a coffee! The crowd of bystanders awkwardly gathers around like a pack of zombies while the pair give a very unconvincing and self-conscious performance. The scene has no dramatic pay-off and instead seems to drag on forever.Best aspect of the film is the cinematography featuring beautiful location shooting with real castles, ruins and mountainous settings.

This movie was awful! You don't have to have all your special effects down like the year 2000, but you can at least choose music that doesn't place it square in its decade. There were NO SYNTHESIZERS and NO DRUM MACHINES in Medieval/Renaissance Britain. Did Mathew Broderick have to have that 80s hairdo? As for the plot, nothing could have been more predictable. All enemies (including a neverending supply of generic guards) are vanquished. The quest is completed. Everyone goes home, watches Jeopardy! while eating a TV dinner, goes to bed, wakes up in the morning and goes on with their predicable boring lives.The final scene in the Church was deplorable. For starters, omigosh is he going to kill the Police Chief guy? Can the Police Chief guy even fight? All we've seen him do is sit around while others fight. He's looking good, now he's not looking good, oh now it's in slow motion so you better pay attention. He killed him, what a surprise. Then the curse is lifted. Is he going to kill the Bishop? No, he's not. He's just going to leave with his wife. OH NO, more slow motion while he kills the Bishop. Didn't see that coming. And one more thing, the audience in the church just watches, doesn't react. They're not excited that they're watching a swordfight, nor are they scared that they might become collateral damage. They're just watching as if it were a normal Sunday morning sermon. And at the end, lovers reunited, no cheering just kind of staring blankly without a director telling them they should leave the stage.There is no excuse for making this bad of a movie. It would have made a better book.

This was one of the most ridiculous, most poorly executed, worst written movies to come out of the 80's.From the first you are accosted by a god-awful soundtrack that could've come from a jazzercize video (whose idea was it to score a medieval movie with an orchestra made up completely by synthesizers?), and then right away you are treated to a hideous English accent by Matthew Broderick (which is accomplished simply by over-enunciating each word). Why he had to try so pitifully to fake such a bad accent while Michelle Pfeiffer didn't even bother is beyond imagining. His clumsy, flat delivery reminded me of a kid at a renaissance fair who thinks if he says m'lady it makes him English. The best acting in the whole film came from the wolf.The writing was flat and awkward, the lines completely wooden and forced, and the story so abrupt and poorly thought out that is was as if a high schooler wrote it as an excuse to see Pfeiffer turn into a bird. None of it made any sense, and not in the way that fantasy doesn't make sense in the real world...but in the way that there was barely any plot to hold what was supposed to be a story together. The fight scenes looked like rehearsals- those maddening scenes where all the other bad guys wait patiently to take turns fighting/chasing the hero, so that they each get a chance, one at a time. The whole thing was laughable from start to finish, but not in a good way. None of the funny lines were at all funny, but uncomfortably recognizable as an attempt at humor- kind of like when a ten-year-old tells you a knock-knock joke that you heard when you were ten, and it wasn't funny then, either. This movie could have been directed by a broken record that repeated over and over the same commandsBroderick, say m'lady.Hauer, scream at the sky.Pfeiffer, look startled.Bad guy, look menacing.shot of a wolf here, shot of a hawk here.Repeat.This is one of those movies where you find yourself shouting at the screen because of the unbelievably stupid lines, plot developments, and acting. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie if you have even an ounce of appreciation for good movies. "}]
