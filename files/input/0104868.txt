Even though I've seen it a million times, I still get chills when the team works as a team and goes out to try their hardest. It's enough to make me, one of the least sporty people alive, want to join a sporting team. Another highlight, for me at least, were the guys. I always had at least one guy in the movie who I had a crush on and kept my undivided attention on. Who would've known back then that young Charlie (Joshua Jackson) would grow up to use big words and pretentious speeches on Dawson's Creek?

Not your typical fairytale, but a rugged kids adventure, which also goes into that winning is not everything, but that being in a team and playing as a team is the most important part of any sport and is good measure for a person's life.Aggressive trial lawyer Gordon Bombay has never lost a case. But when he's sentenced to a community service assignment, he must coach a ragtag team of peewee hockey players who can't skate, can't score and can't win. First he teaches the hapless team everything about winning and they teach him that winning is not everything. Watch the pucks fly as they battle their way to the most important game of their lives!This film is a great story for young up and coming sports &#145;people' to watch and learn that winning is not the be all and end all of sport. Sure there are some people such as Coach Reilly, because they are not true sports lovers. Instead they treat sport as a serious event, not something that as Gordon Bombay says should be &#145;fun'. In Australia, and my part of this country, we have Aussie Rules football, which again is a very team orientated sport. Although it can have some extraordinary individuals that play, the theme is still the same, that a team has to stick together and try as hard as it can.This movie has a very young and funny cast, with some old heads thrown in for good team balance. The obvious star is Emilio Estevez, who stars as Gordon Bombay. While he is a very aggressive character in the beginning, Gordon brings his knowledge and experience to a group of young kids that would make any sports coach proud. Estevez has had a good movie career, with some of his more well known movies being The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, and an unaccredited role in Mission Impossible . The other main star is a very young Joshua Jackson who portrayed Charlie Conway, a good ice-hockey player, who reminds his coach a lot of himself as a young peewee hockey player. Jackson has made a name for himself in Hollywood starring in films such as Cruel Intentions, the disappointing Skulls and the popular TV drama, `Dawson's Creek'.Other cast members also include the rival coach of the Hawks Ice-Hockey team, Coach Reilly  played by veteran actor Lane Smith.  He also starred in another great film I saw recently, which happened to be on another popular sport, that of  golf, the film being `The Legend of Bagger Vance'. All the characters that are on the Mighty ducks team are likeable people. The team consists of a fat kid, a silent kid, a nice kid, a wiseacre kid, a figure-skating princess, and a tough kid. The whole formula works for me anyway. I thought that this film had some impressive Ice-Hockey scenes that looked real, though I will never know if they are real or not. Ice-Hockey is a demanding sport and this movie shows that this is the case, with heavy bumps and unrelenting pressure on players. It was good to see that this sport has both males and females playing together, again the movie shows how well the two can gel. So, if you think that sport is not your thing, but want to give it a go, perhaps this film is what you need to watch. Although this isn't the most talented group of athletes to take the ice, and in the beginning the Ducks do really &#145;suck', they prove that with some good coaching guidance and team camaraderie, anything is possible if you put your mind to it.QUACK QUACK QUACK &#150; Go the Ducks!Rating 8/10 or 4 Stars "},{"Title":"EMILIO!!!!!!!!!!!!","Date":"18 June 2004","Score":"9 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  Directed by Stephen Herek BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, THE MIGHTY DUCKS was a surprise box office hit in 1992 and was followed by two better sequels and a decent animated series.

A movie that was made from the heart. The reasons for it? There are two of them that stick out to me.Gordon Bombay goes through one hell of a transformation. He goes from a drunk lawyer to reconnecting with his old love and facing a demon that has haunted him up to now. Even the introduction scene carries an ominous feeling. The goalie facing the young Bombay looks more like a menacing monster; as well as it should be since it represents a horrible memory for the man. I remember being scared of that scene as a child, just cause the goalie looked so scary.His character's transformation over the movie is the heart of this film. It's a protagonist who has a REAL arc - beginning, middle, and end. It's all carried out with such poignancy as well. Emilio Estevez does great acting.The child actors do a good job. I mean, they're KIDS, and this is a kid movie...but they pull it off nicely. The kids who play Charlie, Fulton, Jesse, and Banks especially. They make you take their characters seriously, which is different from a normal kids movie.The kiddy parts don't make me cringe, but make me smile. I guess because it's not overdone.Sorry to say, but the other two movies to me relied too much on either hockey action or gimmicks (although I DID like D3's grittier hockey action and more serious story with Charlie). They didn't have the heartfelt story that this one did. It's all balanced out to entertain the little kids, but Gordon Bombay's arc is one for the adults.I also miss the kids that would end up not being in the future movies. In D3, when Gordon says that the Ducks were unchanged since the beginning, I cringed. I guess I'm the type to cling to sentimental values like that.This was the best movie out of the trilogy to me. That's because it felt like a REAL movie.

But Estevez plays pretty well and the characters around him are fine. First, it is a real hockey movie, for a short movie there's hockey action and you go to big production budget sports movies and there is hardly any sport action. So to be fair, at least it is seriously about hockey. Maybe this movie is a bit cheesy, copied off Bad News Bears, that may be - but the Ducks are a NHL hockey franchise, that's a a pretty big deal! You can turn a kids' movie into a pro team, that's a pretty big deal and the lines from this movie have left a bigger blueprint than Rocky's ugh feel lightheaded retarded dialogue. There's a weird romance between Charlie's mom and Bombay but thank goodness it doesn't go anywhere, because it shouldn't. How does Bombay who is a true great prospect quits without no real reason the game then is sent to community service to coach a district team when he's never coach then gets a tryout for the minors from a Northstar player who remembers him, is kind of lazy development.

Director Stephen Herek does a fine job with the lifeless material including the familiar production. He previously made the more inventive Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and the dumbfounded Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead. With this film his screenwriter fails to deliver an excellent adventure, but like the babysitter in the other film, this one is totally dead. The screenplay is filled with types. You have the ominous big kid who can hit well but amateur in other areas. You have the kid who needs encouragement and whose mother will end up romancing with the coach she first disliked. Sound familiar? Estivez basically goes through the same tired formula that many others have with results that will surprise no one. Joss Ackland, Joshua Jackson and Lane Smith appear in cardboard supporting roles and everyone of them are pretty much interchangeable.

From the children in the pee-wee hockey team, from its headlining stars, to just plain background characters, it seems everyone has that same question on their mind.Well, where the hell do I begin? The Mighty Ducks is an experiment done by Disney that was allegedly aimed to usher in a more tweenish fanbase than their animation studios, by providing a live action experience and a more mature feel. They succeeded in making a spontaneous, somewhat entertaining piece of nostalgia for the current generation of teens, but to be completely honest, this is one of the most vanilla sports movies I've sat through in my day, only elevated to being somewhat passable because of its efficient use of its star, Emilio Estevez (seeing this as a child, this was my introduction to the man who would later be one of my favorite male character actors) and its surprisingly successful array of motivational music, which make the cliché ending satisfying and memorable.The story is paper thin, but works as some minor league, or pee-wee, entertainment. Estevez plays Gordon Bombay, an immensely cocky, successful defense attorney who has never lost a case in his life, but is sentenced to coach a team of young, misfit hockey players after being caught drunk driving. Bombay has had contention with the sport of hockey after he blew a title win in a penalty shot as a child, greatly putting his coach (Lane Smith) to shame.Now, coaching the District Five team, Bombay is unmotivated and careless, until he sees these kids are genial and somewhat good-natured (and the fact that his old coach is still employed at their rival team), leading him to finally put effort into his work. He names the team the Ducks, after the most noble creature in the wild, who travel in packs and stick by one another.Estevez gives about the most entertaining performance one could bring to the table for this kind of movie. His character is a smart-ass, cut-throat, boisterous know-it-all, who winds up having his heart warmed by a group of helpless kids who don't take that much pride playing for the hockey team until he gets involved.One of the downfalls of the children is that they are carbon-copies of the rambunctious tykes we see in so many movies, and any point at connecting or learning about one of them is especially moot. They are not interesting children, and even in a hundred and three minutes, we do not even get one as our surrogate to learn more about. Not to mention, the film is also about twenty minutes to long, thanks to a needless romantic subplot involving one of the children's mothers. The result is corny and usually unnecessary, but Estevez's chemistry with the mother, Heidi King, is just charming enough to make us somewhat care.As simple, pleasant entertainment, obviously the film's main goal, The Mighty Ducks works just fine as basic and has competence to carry a long runtime. The problem lies in its screenplay, which is flat and unambitious. Even though it's branded with the Disney name, just a few years later, we were welcomed with the brilliant breath of fresh air which was Remember the Titans, so Disney clearly wasn't incapable of delivering the goods in a sports film. The slapstick-reliant humor is goofy, yet it works, Estevez is fitting in his role, and the ending with music dominated by Queen brings a smile even to a hard-headed cynic's face. It's a Disney movie that gets half the job done.Starring Emilio Estevez, Joss Ackland, Lane Smith, Heidi Kling, Josef Sommer, Joshua Jackson, Elden Henson, and Shaun Weiss. Directed by Stephen Herek.

Basically young hotshot lawyer Gordon Bombay (The Breakfast Club's Emilio Estevez) is arrested for drink driving, and the court orders him to serve community service by coaching a children's hockey team, not very good in their league, and of course he is not happy. As he gets to know the youngsters though, and gains their like for him as well, he teaches them good skills of how to play and ultimately win a match. They also manage to get a sponsor and don the team name of The Ducks, but while all this is going on Gordon still has flashes from his past where he played hockey himself, watched by now apposing Coach Jack Reilly (Lois & Clark The New Adventures of Superman's Lane Smith), and he lost. It is coming close to the finals, and he is possible to lose the team due to his sentence having come to an end, and all the young members of The Ducks may be losing some hope for whatever reason. Of course everything comes back together in the end, Gordon watches his team score victory, and the last scene sees him going away to tryout in the minor league, and he promises to return for the next season (this obviously gives way for the sequels). Also starring Joss Ackland as Hans, Heidi Kling as Casey Conway, Joshua Jackson as Charlie Conway, Josef Sommer as Mr. Gerald Ducksworth, Elden Henson as Fulton Reed, Shaun Weiss as Greg Goldberg, Lost's M.C. Gainey as Lewis and Matt Doherty as Lester Averman. I will be completely honest and say that I didn't pay the fullest of attention to this, but even if I had I doubt I would have been entertained all the way through, it seemed pretty dull and rather predictable, it may have the heartwarming and sporty moments, but overall not a great family sports comedy.

The plot isn't complicated, as many have said, Gordon Bombay is an overworked lawyer who gets a DUI charge and is given community service, coaching a kids hockey team of misfits. The difficulty in this is Gordon played hockey himself as a kid, and blew a championship game. Without giving too much away, Gordon teaches the kids hockey, and they teach him to not take life too seriously.What makes this movie special is really the portrayal of the kids. Sure they sort of fall in to stereotypes, the goofy fat kid, the short but tough kid, the misunderstood bad kid, the lovable and sweet underdog (Charlie Conway, played by Joshua Jackson, pre Pacy, although in the Ducks sequels you see shades of that character coming out!) but these characters feel real, and are very funny. I don't know if younger kids still watch this movie but if you ask any teenagers who Goldberg is you'll get a laugh and some fun reminiscing.

It is the not-so-original story about a coach and his team. The team happens to be a group of annoying children who slide around the hockey rink and who learn what it is like to be the underdog and then succeed through the help of their heroic coach. I found this to be an annoying (the children got on my nerves) film which lacked anything and everything possible to qualify as a decent film. Maybe, if you enjoy the game of hockey and these children do not annoy you, you will enjoy this. I hope you do because I didn't enjoy it.

The hockey scenes are entertaining and the ending albeit unbelievable left you with a semi warm feeling that almost made me wanna put down the remote and pick up a hockey stick.

However, this film, is extremely well done. The script was shaky at times, but the cast seemed to fit very well, and the music (mostly Queen songs) were very well used. The plot is a simple one...bad hockey team, overworking lawyer/ex-hockey player. The lawyer/hockey player gets a DUI, must coach hockey team. I'll try not to spoil the film's plot, though it is a basic one, with your predictable, yet heart-warming feeling.Be on the lookout for future Dawson's Creek star Joshua Jackson in his second, and most notable role (excluding playing Pacy) playing the leader, Charlie Conway.*** out of **** "},{"Title":"IMDb should research sports plots","Date":"1 January 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" I loved The Might Ducks. It helps that I play ice hockey and am an avid fan when I'm not playing. IMDb may want to do some research for this movie's plot. Gordon Bombay misses a penalty shot not a shootout. Those are two separate events that simply involve the same type of play.Otherwise this movie does contain very juvenile humor so if you are looking for high brow go somewhere else. I really liked when Gordon tells Charlie that you may make it you may not before Charlie takes his penalty shot. It's of course very obvious ending with Conway getting the penalty shot and winning it all. A more realistic ending would have been Charlie missing the shot too but then somehow because of their attitude they don't let it get them down and they win it in overtime.Oh well though. It was a really great movie and when members critique these movies they should always check the date on the movie because technology has grown in leaps and bounds over the last few years.

This movie reminds me of when I played in a Pee Wee hockey league and my team sucked. It was so much fun, and it was portrayed very well in this movie. The ending, even thought its a Disney movie, was not too corny. It was a good, happy ending to the movie, not overdone in any way.The story was good, but I'm not going to spoil it for anyone. Basically its about a horrible hockey team that needs a coach. The coach is a mean, up-tight lawyer who is forced to do community service. Together they become champions.Emelio Estevez does a great job as coach Gordon Bombay and really adds more of an adult humor to the cast of misfit kids that bring funny, but immature humor to the movie.Disney does good. 9/10 "},{"Title":"leave this alone","Date":"20 May 2003","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  This movie single-handedly got my interesting in the sport of hockey, I really didn't care for the sequels which were trash.

Thankfully I loved this film. The whole underdog rising up, the coach's redemption, and the big game finale wasn't as hokey as you might expect it to be. Emilio Estevez is a very winning actor in this film, maybe he should stick to light comedy. The kids in the cast are extremely comfortable in front of the camera and mesh with each other well. All in all a wonderful film by Disney, even if it did give the company the impression that they knew so much about hockey that they went out and bought a team. "},{"Title":"typical of this genre","Date":"1 February 2008","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" I pretty much have no respect for movies like The Mighty Ducks. OK, so it's basically a harmless movie. But stories of the underdog figuring out a way to win against all odds has long since turned into a cliché (Rocky was the original, and it had a purpose). Emilio Estevez has starred in much better movies (e.g., The Outsiders).To this movie's credit, I will say that the more-like-a-circumcision scene was pretty entertaining. This is far from the worst movie ever. But seriously, there are too many movies like this. As it is, Stephen Herek hasn't made much of a name for himself as a director. His only good movies were Critters and Mr. Holland's Opus. Otherwise, aside from this movie, he's directed stuff like Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead and Life or Something Like It. Basically, he competes with Michael Bay and Renny Harlin for the position of Worst Director in the World.So my recommendation is to avoid this movie. "},{"Title":"The Bad News Bears on ice. (minor spoilers)","Date":"13 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Despite the tremendously clichéd plot--that of an aging fallen athletic hero who loses faith in himself and disinterest in the sport until he has the opportunity to turn a misfit team into a victorious one with hard work and much-needed nurturing--the Mighty Ducks is probably for those youngsters of the early 1990s what films like the Karate Kid were to those youngsters of the mid-80s. One of the classics, a guilty pleasure we secretly don't switch off when channel surfing on lazy weekend afternoons. One that marked early careers or more well-known stars today (with the most obvious being a prepubescent Joshua Jackson). For hockey fans alone, it may be enjoyable, despite hockey movies never being very inventive in the tell of the tale (see Youngblood and Miracle for other examples of the same old, same old). But nonetheless, it is still a valued time capsule and a feel good movie that yes, cheesy and clichéd and dated (no one really does much roller-blading anymore--see the practice scenes, can still be enjoyed.

For his punishment, he is forced to the inner-city of Minneapolis to coach a youth ice hockey team of rag-tag players with little talent and seemingly fewer social skills. 192nd verse, same as the first 191 as the Hollywood under-dog sports story is revisited yet again with unremarkable results. Estevez' past failure as a youth hockey player himself is given a foggy glimpse and old coach Lane Smith ends up being the antagonist here. None of the kids (led by Joshua Jackson) make much of an impression in this cold and thoughtless would-be family flick from the Disney studios. Inspiration for the NHL's Anaheim Ducks and followed by two equally unwanted sequels. 2.5 out of 5 stars.
