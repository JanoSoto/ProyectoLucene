[{"Title":"one of Arnold's weakest vehicles","Date":"28 July 2002","Score":"50 out of 76 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I remember a time, in the not too distant past, when any new movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was treated as an event.  Nowadays, his films slip in and out of town with nary a person even noticing.  What's happened?  The sad but obvious explanation is that, as he's aged, Arnold has had to make way for younger, more dynamic action stars, leaving him stuck with leftover crumbs like `Collateral Damage,' a dull, lackluster action film that manages to kick itself into high gear only in its final half hour or so. `Collateral Damage' was, of course, one of those films whose original release date had to be postponed in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks.  In this case, the sensitivity arose as a result of the film's storyline, which revolves around a group of Colombian terrorists determined to strike at targets on American soil.  Schwarzenegger plays fireman Gordy Brewer, whose wife and child are killed in an explosion at the Colombian consulate in Los Angeles.  Brewer, feeling that the U.S. government has little concern with exacting revenge from the terrorist leader responsible for the explosion, decides to mount a one-man crusade to see that justice is ultimately done.  The film, obviously indifferent to its own need for plausibility, sends this virtually unarmed fireman into the unfamiliar jungles of South America to take on what appears to be the entire Colombian police force as well as the guerilla fighters whose actions resulted in the deaths of Brewer's family.  Brewer, of course, despite his own inexperience and the formidable odds against him, manages to talk and/or fight his way out of every dire predicament before rescuing his nemesis' wife and their adopted son. There isn't much to say about `Collateral Damage' except to report that the film does achieve a certain tension in the closing stretches, when Brewer returns to Washington D.C. to help foil a plot to detonate a bomb in that city.  Thanks to a few nice plot twists, the film ends up not being a total loss when all is finally said and done.It's never much fun to have to witness an actor in the sunset of his career.  But if Schwarzenegger's films don't start improving soon, he may well have to switch to that career in politics he has reportedly been looking into between films.

A fireman's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wife and son get blown up when a terrorist (Cliff Curtis) is trying to destroy some target. He googles terrorist on his home computer, finds out who is responsible, and goes off into the jungle to capture him. He escapes. In the meantime, he hooks up with the terrorist's wife (Francesca Neri), wins her to his side, and they go off back to the States to catch him. If that is not the most unbelievable plot you can imagine, then there are some twists and turns that are even more incredible.But, who cares? This is the Governator kicking some major butt like he did in True Lies, Commando, and many other movies that you and I watch over and over.Italian actress Neri (Live Flesh) is hot, Curtis (Whale Rider) makes a perfect terrorist, and one of my favorites, John Leguizamo (Land of the Dead), plays a great part. Even Monk's agoraphobic brother, John Turturro, is here. Wow! But, it's all about the damage, collateral and otherwise, that draws you to the movie. The fireman turned terminator turns up the heat (red, of course) and proceeds to erase the terrorist.

Here, Arnold is just a plain old fireman but he turns into superhero, doing things only Superman or Batman could accomplish....but it's still fun to watch.After seeing his wife and kid blown up by Columbian terrorists, Arnold goes after the latter, traveling to the jungles of that South American country and taking them on! In the end, he's in Washington trying to diffuse another terrorist plot. He's amazing. What CAN'T this guy do? Yes, it's ludicrous....but it's not meant to be taken seriously, folks! It's just entertainment for fans of action movies, nothing more.There is a nice twist at the end of this story and it involves a very intriguing-looking woman, Francesco Neri. I just love that woman's face very sexy, especially for someone her age. She's also in Hannibal but I think the rest of her films are Italian. I would like to see more of her work. There are also some short appearances by two always-entertaining actors, John Turturro and John Leguizimo. Scharwarznegger's action films usually have a fair amount of tongue-in-cheek humor and those two actors help along those lines in this film.Elias Koteas plays the too-gung-ho FBI guy. Hollywood just will not portray an FBI, CIA, DEA, or any government agent in a positive manner. That would offend their liberal peers in the movie business, so Koteas plays the lawman you can't trust in this movie. In fact, they make it so you don't know if you can trust anyone in the government, which also is typical Hollywood fare.Don't believe the national critics, however, if they panned this film. It's two hours of good escapist fare.

In the preview, this seems like typically horrible dialog for an action movie.  However, I was surprised that, in the context that it was used, it wasn't too cheesy.I saw a 'behind the scenes' thing on HBO and everyone involved was saying that this was something really different for Arnie.  Why is it that people say that about every movie he's in?  They're all the same!  But that's okay.  We're used to it.  In 'End of Days' he played an alcoholic.  We knew this, not because we ever saw him drunk, but because some one brought it up every ten minutes.  These are things that we've come to accept about Arnold's movies.  So stop telling us that this is something new.At least, that's what I've felt for a while now.  This movie is a little different.  It's not a stretch, or anything radically different.  But it isn't the exact same thing that Arnold's done before.  It is, however, the same thing we've seen from other people before.  It seems that he looks at what is popular, and he does his version of that.  People like government agents, I'll do 'Eraser.'  People like supernatural stuff, I'll do 'End of Days.'  What's all this I hear about a movie with a twist at the end being brilliant?  I suppose I'll do 'Collateral Damage.'So is it good?  Is it bad?  It just is.  One thing I am glad about is that is was rated R.  I am sick of movies being cut down to PG-13 simply because some people feel that things should be accessible to the family.  Cutting stuff to do that ALWAYS detracts from the quality of a movie.  I've actually heard directors say that they needed to take the energy level down on a scene in order to qualify.  Why would you want to do that?Yes, this movie's release was postponed.  We all have our own opinions on that and nothing, not even seeing the movie, is going to change our minds.One final note Am I the only one who, when watching Cliff Curtis, can only think, You know what I think?

We expect Arnold to run into a terrorist compound in the jungle, guns blazing, unlimited explosives, managing to not get hit by gunfire even while standing still in the middle of a field, one-liners running like water...But THAT movie was Commando.  Remember?Anyway, in Collateral Damage Arnold is actually a vulnerable character. He gets BEAT UP more than he beats up others.  Now, while Arnold fans (myself included) prefer Arnold to be invincible, in this case it works really well.  Not just because it moves the story along, but also because it makes the protagonist more believable.  Ok, sure, Arnold saying gracias to some Columbian bus driver is HARDLY believable, but I think you know what I mean.You will also find yourself saying who is the REAL villain here? on more than one occasion.  Sure, terrorists kill.  That's what they do.  But why do you THINK they became terrorists to begin with?  Collateral Damage touches on the subject briefly - enough to humanize the terrorist leader, even!Most of the reviews I've read here have been negative...  But those same reviewers were probably Arnold-philes who were expecting something along the lines of Commando 2.  As it is, personally I really enjoyed Collateral Damage.

What I got was something else.The story Firefighter loses family in terrorist attack, goes on revenge mission to Columbia to find and kill terrorist. Sounds pretty dumb to me - and, let's face it, a lot of aspects of the movie are incredibly dumb. (Mostly those parts of the movie concerned with Arnie getting to Columbia, travelling through Columbia and getting into the rebel camp)But, and here's the catch, some are not. What starts out a simple movie with linear plot evolves slowly. After the rage comes a period of reflection. There are twists and turns in the plot, and the first half is full of time-filling minutes spent getting to know yet-another-comedic sidekick, who will disappear entirely from the movie within minutes (couldn't they have stuck with one sidekick? Or not bothered at all?), but then, as the plot turns around, the audience is suddenly faced with an interesting moment (which is later ruined by cheesy dialogue). Well, this being an action movie, the smart bits can last only so long, and then it all goes to pieces in a desperate attempt to have a traditional climactic good vs bad battle. So the end is a big let-down.Still, the movie IS entertaining (apart from a few minutes of boredom and confusion in the Columbia part) and, surprisingly, well-acted. Arnie is no character actor, and the mess he made of End of Days was embarrassing. Sixth Day brought some more flexing of acting muscles, and I actually liked his performance in that movie. Collateral Damage takes all he learnt and puts it to the test. He will never manage a Bruce-Willis alike 6th Sense / Unbreakable career turnaround, but he acted his role well, and was convincing. Mostly, at least. The support cast, filled with aforementioned comedic sidekicks, a CIA agent, a FBI agent and the terrorist and a Columbian woman - all do their jobs well. I kept wondering where I'd seen Cliff Curtis before, until I looked it up on IMDB - he was the charismatic leader of the Iraqi resistance in Three Kings. Here, he manages to dominate the screen just as well and once again is a show-stealer. Definitely the most memorable character of the movie.So, we have good acting, good entertainment, stupid action, a stupid end and some reasonably intelligent bit somewhere along the way. The body count is high, but surprisingly, Arnold does not actually kill many people (you can count his victims on the fingers of one hand). There is a gruesome scene involving a snake, which is basically pointless, but that did not reduce my enjoyment of the movie. All in all, a good movie to watch. Not brilliant, but not as bad as some people may think either.

Here Arnie is given a strong role as the grieving widower you wouldn't want to mess with, and it's nice to see he's still more than capable as a charismatic lead and as a hero in the action stakes. Sadly I was expecting more, especially with Andrew Davis, the director who bought us THE FUGITIVE and UNDER SIEGE, but COLLATERAL DAMAGE is a relatively dark and unexciting film which goes through the paces, working hard to build up some bizarre characters (John Turturro and John Leguizamo cameo) and maintain a realistic sweaty atmosphere when the action shifts to Colombia.Things only really start to gel for the finale, in which the action shifts back to Washington and there's a great race against time as Arnie tries to stop the bad guys before they blow up another building and waste more innocent lives. This is the Arnie we know and love, with pumping adrenaline action and some cool stuntwork and explosions. Otherwise the plot offers just one good surprise twist and some above average acting (Elias Koteas sails through his role as shifty CIA Agent Brandt) from the above average cast, but the story doesn't say anything new and there aren't enough fights, chases or shoot-outs (Arnie doesn't even get a gun this time!) to justify a satisfying experience for this action fan. The political message itself is just a backbone on which to base the shallow plot and the end result is that you're left wanting a bit more from the veteran performer.

Had the film been released at its intended date, it could've held more meaning and may have even been forgiven for being rather dull and unmemorable, due to leading man Schwarzenegger's ever-increasingly-fading action star status.The film, textbook Arnold Schwarzenegger, has one major flaw Arnie's getting old.  He has noticeably less hair, and his trademark accent doesn't seem as pronounced as it used to be.  His invincible/robotic action hero style also seems lacking, and he isn't even given any cool sarcastic action hero catch phrases! The last problem (arguably the worst, especially seeing how I'll be back... is still a major part of his reputation today) is made even worse since nobody has any such lines; even the sole comic relief character, an employee at a drug camp with dreams of being a rapper, is killed off but a few minutes after introduction.  A potentially shocking swerve is handled fairly well until it becomes immediately obvious during its setup.  There's a relatively impressive explosion/climactic battle sequence, but other than that, there's not much to like in this film.There is one interesting thing about the film, that being that, made before 9/11 but released after, it is not a total propaganda piece.  Arnold hardly oozes patriotism, and the script is even fair enough to present the truth that, though the Columbian rebels may indeed be a villainous lot who conduct heartless acts of terror, that their reason for fighting and their actions can be traced back to similar actions against their own countrymen by the U.S. government.  The film-makers even let an intelligence agent who is seen commanding the slaughter of a rebel camp get killed.  Had the film been released as coincidentally intended almost immediately after 9/11 (and really, the fact that it was too controversial at the time is rather ludicrous, since the explosion from the beginning and the explosion averted at the end are nowhere near on level with the events of 9/11, unless the controversy referred to was the admission of the U.S. causing the trouble in Columbia), it would've no doubt gained at least a low level of appreciation just because Arnie kills some terrorists.  Now that the media has overdone patriotism everywhere else, however, even that part of its concept seems too weak and gimmicky to be taken seriously.

The story worked for me, Cliff Curtis was good as the villain, Arnold was great, the twist at the end was nice, the action scenes were fun, and altogether I think it's a very solid movie.For me, Collateral Damage & End of Days are the only Schwarzenegger movies where he actually gives a acting performance. I think both of the films are very underrated and bashed for their credits for it. This one is the 7h movie that in my opinion are his best movies and Collateral Damage is one of them. It is my favorite best movie that I absolutely love. Collateral Damage is above average action thriller very underrated from the early 2002 people just hate this movie I loved it, This movie rules!Great movie if you like Arnold Schwarzenegger I would recommend this movie if you like a lot of action packed scenes and explosions. Collateral damage is very good movie and entertaining. I love the twist! You cannot take the law into your own hands.While The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and Collateral Damage may not be classic examples of art imitating life and vice versa, the real-life attacks did put a temporary halt to the film's scheduled October 2001 release. And certainly, the film does share a few primary similarities with that day. Collateral Damage's hero is a firefighter, and a terror attack in a major U.S. city -- Los Angeles to be exact -- leads to panic and the main character's own struggles with loss and a thirst for revenge. But otherwise, director Andrew Davis' (Above the Law) Collateral Damage plays as a fun and superficially routine Action flick that's full of explosions and gunfire but that goes above and beyond the call of duty, crafting a surprisingly deep plot, one with a rather heavy emotional undercurrent -- even beyond the loss of the main characters' family -- and a few quality twists and turns that keep the movie fresh and its landscape always evolving. While this may not be the quintessential Action movie -- it's no Die Hard -- or even the finest flick to Andrew Davis' name, this is a good, high quality, high yield Action movie, and as is always the case with a Schwarzenegger film, it's well worth seeing if only for the star's presence, energy, and charisma. Firefighter Gordon Brewer is plunged into the complex and dangerous world of international terrorism after he loses his wife and child in a bombing credited to Claudio The Wolf Perrini. Frustrated with the official investigation and haunted by the thought that the man responsible for murdering his family might never be brought to justice, Brewer takes matters into his own hands and tracks his quarry ultimately to Colombia.After his family is killed by a terrorist act, a firefighter goes in search of the one responsible.I love this Action flick How Arnold went on his own in to the jungle of Colombia to find the terrorists responsible for his family murder. I find this very Entertained action film for a Schwarzenegger fan like me. I love this film and I have always enjoy it. Collateral Damage is so much better film than Terminator Genisys ,Maggie or Sabotage were. I don't care about the new movies Arnold is doing today they are all crap, Escape Plan and The Last Stand are his last films that were really good to watch, the rest of the films he did weren't. Arnold stop making such a bad films this days please! I love the action scenes the explosion in all movies Arnold kills the bad guys with guns and knives. In this film he uses plastic explosives and his intelligent skills. The end and the twist was fantastic the action scenes were just perfect. This film isn't above average so stop hating on it. The film tells the story of Los Angeles firefighter, Gordon Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who looks to avenge his son and wife's death at the hands of a guerrilla commando, by traveling to Colombia and facing his family's killers. I disagree with all the haters of this film including Stan Goff this film is not horrible. Terminator Genisys , Sabotage and Maggie are far worst films than Collateral Damage is.

This film, unlike many others of his, focuses more on capture and revenge. The 'you could say' revenge he wants on a certain terrorist who does something awful that will have an impact and will affect Gordon (Arnold) for life. But genuinely speaking, it's a great film. Less violence, killing and action, more build-up, focus and thought. I really love this film and it's one of my favourite Arnold Schwarzenegger films. I would rate it a strong 8.5 out of 10, and I think the co-stars in it are pretty great too and they're very good actors. The production, directing and scenery of the film is terrific and different and the locations for shooting with the scenery set up is absolutely great. If you've not seen this film, you should totally watch it. It's a great film and it brings out something different in Arnold and in his acting career. He's a fireman who wants revenge this time.

I regard this as some of Schwarzenegger's best acting, he shows compassion, regardless hatred, and you really get a sense he is just trying to give some low-life terrorist what he deserves. He is also intelligent and turns from fire-fighter to basically a FBI agent when the rest aren't up to the mark/not have enough information. It is a shame people like Harry Lennix and Elias Koteas didn't get more screen time, but hey ho, you can't have everything.It is let down by a few errors, such as the cliché family death thing, and the protection of children etc. But not enough to lower the rating to 5.2/10 in my opinion.

After his family is killed in a terrorist attack, and the government fails to rectify the situation, Arnie takes matters into his own hands, setting out to Colombia where he intends to take down El Lobo (Cliff Curtis), the man responsible for his loss.Released in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, Collateral Damage suffered massive cuts and re-shoots and it shows in the final product. While Arnold, pushing well into his 50's at this point, is in top form and director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) knows how to pace the action and cue the suspense, the film can't help but feel somewhat compromised, and, well, neutered. Unlike, say, the Rambo flicks, this film is rather mild in its depiction of war and terrorism and, in spite of some of its more thrilling action sequences, is host to some rather shoddy CGI work, especially in its final act, which could be chalked up to the rushed re-shoots.The action is decent enough, and as always, Arnie carries the weight of the film as best as he can. In the end, it's a passable effort that is, at the very least, engaging and exciting. Yet, one can't help but feel like it could have been more. The second to last film Arnold would star in before becoming The Governator, Collateral Damage is on the lower end of his action oeuvre, but is certainly a more respectable effort than, say, Junior or Jingle All The Way.

It could be argued that this was dealt a bad hand on account of its(obviously unforeseen) timing; however, that argument may be void and null. I'm not so sure it'd have fared all that well, regardless... even if it hadn't coincided with the tragic real-life event(this is not the appropriate forum to discuss whether or not it could have been prevented), or subsequently undergone changes. It's just not that strong, overall. It starts out pretty well, but the way it continues... the movie and the people working on it don't seem to realize(or if it does, no readily apparent measures to correct this were taken) that the merciless berating(whether or not it's true) of Colombia gets *really* old, very fast; rather, it continues throughout, and whatever point may have once been present disappears in all the repetition(how many times do the words kidnapping and drugs have to be mentioned in just one feature in connection to a single geographical location?). The plot starts out as more or less usual revenge-flick stuff, and had it stayed there, this would be fine. But it tries to judge and moralize, and it winds up with too many things going on, too many pointed fingers, in various directions, and apart from not fitting with the tone of the flick, and worse than that, it just gets messy and unfocused. The acting is fine. Both John's do their thing some, but they have very little to do, other than advance the story. Cinematography and editing are decent, nothing special, and they do manage to render unclear one or two parts of this that'd be intense and fun if only the viewer could determine exactly what was happening. The action isn't bad... this can be quite exciting, and that's probably its greatest asset. Arnold dishes out some, and if he is perhaps not as... liberated as in earlier efforts, he does fight dirty some(I've decided to nickname him Mike from now on). Pacing is OK. I recommend this to fans of Arnie, and the genre in general, but I wouldn't suggest a purchase, or maybe even rental... but if you can borrow it from a friend, or it's on TV and you've got to watch some stuff blow up and such, this'll scratch the itch(if not as well as other pieces could). 6/10 "},{"Title":"Don't have to see all of one of Arnold's films","Date":"15 April 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" I tuned-in to this film, which I hadn't seen before, not too far from its conclusion on a Sunday morning.Arnold was a fireman, but performed the same as in his other flicks, where he is the nation's top soldier of fortune, U.S. Marshal, super spy, or such.As opposed to some of this genre, this movie provided an interesting twist at the end - but the other hi-jinks at the climax were still pure Arnold.From other comments here, apparently, he appears in Columbia, post-haste, shortly after the deaths of his family. I saw him elude a firestorm of bullets and missiles with a woman and child in-tow, in the Central American jungles, while everyone and everything around him was totally devastated.Then, with both the Secretaries of Defense and State and hordes of all manner of security and military personnel around, he is the one person who finally figures-out the means to avoid the threatened and impending major holocaust to descend upon D.C. from the Colombian terroristsHe simply slithers down a deep elevator shaft (no great problem for him), and accosts the terrorist villains in a sub-basement. They are are on a motorcycle and armed -- Arnie is on-foot and unarmed. However, two armed, proficient terrorists with a cycle are no match for him on-foot and unarmed. Hell, in True Lies, even a platoon of jihad terrorists, armed with rockets and Uzis, and on their own turf (a remote Florida key), and with Arnie having been given a huge sedative earlier, couldn't match his efforts.But it's all pure fun. One of the other comments here aptly pointed-out that Arnie's mid-50's age is showing some, particularly in close-ups.

The producers decided to postpone the premier in light of these events to early 2002, which to me was a tactful decision on their part.

These are the top reasons why I love the guy. The Terminator, Commando, Raw deal, Predator, The Running man and Terminator 2 Judgment day are all excellent and timeless action classics and Arnold's inimitable stiff style made them so wonderful. However the biggest problem of today's Arnold is the fact that he's already 55 years old, he has turned into way too soft and he hasn't been in a truly terrific action movie after True lies and that was nine years ago. Soon he will put himself in a situation where even the third terminator can't save his ass.Surprisingly, Collateral damage is not a total let down, although that's what I expect from all of Arnie's new films. Actually it's a rather nice action adventure and certainly lot better than his previous flick The 6th day. That's not bad knowing that Arnold betrays all of his old fans and doesn't use or even carry a gun one single time during the movie. The amusing fact that in one scene he bites the ear off from an unsuspecting bad guy is only a slight consolation. I consider myself a pacifistic nature but in the same time I do feel that Schwarzenegger is not quite himself without all that senseless shooting and mindless ultra-violence. Anyway, Collateral damage isn't Arnold's worst effort, there's always films like Jingle all the way and Batman & Robin.

The movie tries so hard to make Gordy look like a normal person with a job as a fireman, yet the lengths he goes for vengeance is almost limitless and pretty darn unconvincing.The stunts were great, the action scenes satisfying but not unusual, and the acting wasn't bad.  Somehow, though, I always see Schwarzenegger's characters as big bad brutes who are tougher than anybody around.  Probably because of previous roles, but that damages his role in this one.  I could really tell they tried to make him like an everyday kind of guy, but the efforts didn't succeed as Jingle All the Way did.  And the cover really kept me from thinking he was the average Joe.However, the acting is good, the original music by Graeme Revell isn't bad, the special effects are what can be expected, and the plot is woven nicely.

IN other words fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger will have a field day with this. Gordy is a fireman, he is good at his job, he has a beautiful wife and an adorable son, what more could a guy ask for? But one day it is all taken away from him in one cowardly swoop as his wife and child fall victim to a terrorist bomber from Columbia. The demands? Get American troops out of Columbia, the solution? Gordy. So Gordy takes it upon himself to go to Columbia and do, as one man, what an entire army can't seem to do, sound familiar? Of course it does, have you foaming at the mouth yet? You bet it does. Think Commando meets Truce Lies with a touch of Backdraft in there somewhere as well. Schwarzenegger along with Sylvester Stallone (Rambo) and Bruce Willis (Die Hard) helped to shape how action movies are seen today. But with Willis trying to expand his acting horizons (Sixth Sense, The Kid) and Stallone taking more sedated roles (Get Cater, Driven) it is up to Schwarzenegger to provide us with a well diserved dose of action that becomes more absent in films as each day passes. But even though Schwarzenegger is over 50 years old and still going strong there is a big change in his work here that sticks out like a soar thumb. People get shot but Schwarzenegger isn't shooting them, things blow up but Schwarzenegger isn't blowing them up (most of the time) and over the top things happen but Schwarzenegger isn't doing them. It almost seems that, instead of being the blunt of most of the action, Schwarzenegger is just an ordinary guy who is placed in the middle of all of it, have to fend for himself instead of pumping lead into everything that moves, some fans may be dissapointed to see that he doesn't even use a gun here. Maybe that's the way it should be thought. Gordy is a fireman, he is supposed to save lives rather than take them. But fear not, the action is still strong and Schwarzenegger still manages to be the toughest guy in site. Now let's face it, Schwarzenegger has never exactly been the greatest actor out, and really why does he need to be we are used to punching, kicking, running, jumping, blowing things up, shooting everyone in site and shooting off a couple great one-liners so there was no need for any acting talent. But here he really seems to be trying and for the most part his performance is rather effective. Maybe it's just my sick sense of humor but I find a scene in which Schwarzenegger totals an office. I don't think that scene was intended to be funny but I just couldn't help but chuckle to myself seeing the big guy take a baseball bat to a bunch of office equipment repeating here's your collateral Damage.Although it's not Rambo or Terminator it's just the missing link that will quench that mysteruos thirst for seeing things blow up and even though director Andrew Davis is trying to make the film more than it is by saying after the 9/11 attacks that this really shows both sides of terrorism and what really makes a hero and blah blah blah, if he wanted to make a film with a message he should have cast Denzel Washington, but this is Schwarzenegger baby and I'm only here to see some s**t blow up, if you want to pick this apart and give everything a meaning than you shouldn't be watching this in the first place.

Like all of Schwarzenegger's films, this is formulaic and unoriginal with great action footage.  This is an unabashed Joe-Six-Pack guy flick.  On that level it succeeds nicely.Of course, this film can't be compared strictly with mindless action flicks, because it pretends to be an international thriller, and here it fails spectacularly.  It attempts to become philosophical, perfunctorily tossing in the idea that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, but the script doesn't dwell very long on this question and quickly proceeds to the next firework show.The incursion of fireman Gordy Brewer into the terrorist camp is so far past implausible that it is comical.  The G-men border on goofy.  And the idea that terrorists would detonate a bomb with a cell phone is just silly.  One wrong number (or telemarketing auto-dialer) and `wham', mission over.The twist ending is decent and at least it is not totally predictable, unlike the rest of the film.  Director Andrew Jackson, best known for his direction of `The Fugitive', keeps the film moving briskly and alternates effectively between action and suspense, without letting the improbability of the script act as an impediment.  Arnold is still in great shape and athletic as ever despite his heart valve replacement.  I have to give him a lot of credit.  After that surgery a lot of actors would have been happy to take less demanding roles.  Arnold simply shrugs it off and continues where he left off.  This is a meld of his two favorite characters, action hero and tough guy with a big heart.  He gives his standard performance, which is not so much a matter of acting, but rather Arnold playing Arnold with someone else's name.  Cliff Curtis is sinister as the terrorist and Francesca Neri is lovely and believable as his duplicitous wife.By Arnold standards, this is not among his best.  By international thriller standards, it is brainless and inadequate.  As an action flick it is entertaining.  Overall, however, I can't give it much more than a 6/10.

We expect them to be filled with malevolent acting and a terrible story line to cope with that type of acting. However, sometimes there are films that turn out to be better than what you expect. In Collateral Damage, we basically jump out with the foregone conclusion that this film is going to be bad. It will just be another action thriller where Arnold Schwarzenegger beats the hell out of somebody (in this case, terrorists). And of course the writers must find a reason for him to beat up these terrorists so they invent a murder of his wife and child. That plot works and yet it is too simple. Arnold turns into a man coping with a tragedy and yet filled with rage and he is just barely able to portray that rage to the audience. He then travels to Columbia and tries to capture and kill a specific terrorist who calls himself The Wolf. What happens after that is basically what you can expect in a Schwarzenegger action picture. However, there is one little surprise near the very end of the film that provides a little twist to what you expect is just another action thriller. If that little surprise had not existed near the end of this film, then I would not be praising this yet another Schwarzenegger action picture (which, by the way, is his last one before his huge epic Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines). In regards to a comment made by Roger Ebert in his review of this film in which he says that this will be the last terrorist film that is post 9/11, I am sorry to say that I would have to agree with him. I believe it to be a plain fact that audiences will not want to go see a terrorist film after what happened on 9/11. Hollywood producers will stay away from that genre of filmmaking for a long time, which says to me that the terrorists of a world far away have succeeded in wiping out a portion of action entertainment.Lenny's Grade *** "},{"Title":"*** Stars Ebert & Roper, this movie Deserves It!","Date":"1 August 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  More than what people think.

During a scheduled rendezvous with his family, he witnesses them die in a bomb explosion that also claims seven other people. A grieving Gordy discovers his wife and son were victims of a political cause instigated by a Columbian terrorist dubbed The Wolf (Cliff Curtis). He seeks out CIA agent Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas) to bring justice to his family and also realises he saw the terrorist before the tragedy. Disappointed and frustrated with the Government?s response to not hunt down his family's killer, Gordy sets on his own vendetta to seek out The Wolf. He infiltrates Columbia, and finds himself emersed in a dangerous solo mission where he is a target for the Guerrillas and an excuse for the CIA not to pull out their forces from the country. Amidst all the potential threats, Gordy's focus remains on hunting down The Wolf and bringing justice to his family.   Collateral Damage was initially due to be released in 2001, but was postponed due it's terrorist subject matter in relation to 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Although the plot is an action film involving the hero taking on terrorism, there is very little social commentary explored and surprisingly minimal flag waving as well, and it shouldn't be confused with a serious film about terrorism. It is basically a fairly tight action thriller with Arnie seeking vengeance for his beloved family. The Wolf is demonised villain to a certain extent in this film, but his character is given some depth and his actions are based on his ideologies, which makes him a little more realistic than more bad guys. Similarly, Peter Brandt's character is also portrayed as ideological driven person, and Gordy continues to confront and question his motives. The circumstances surrounding terrorism may have people questioning the purpose of this film, or the sensitive politically-correct audience may not like the representation of the Columbian guerrillas, yet 'Collateral Damage' is just an Arnie film with a plot for a change! The bad guys are bad guys, and are no more different than the cultural villains portrayed in True Lies, the Rambo films, Patriot Games and other action films with terrorists.Arnold Schwarzenegger provides a sympathetic character in Gordy and he is far from the poster boy of the all-American hero versus the third world- after all he is Austrian. There is plenty of action without being ridiculously over-the-top, and a reduced amount of gratuitous blood and gore in this film. Francesca Neri is fairly good as a Columbian mother who assists Gordy for her own personal motives, and Elias Koteas is entertaining as the dislikeable agent in Peter Brandt.  Schwarzenegger does some decent acting, and he is still entertaining to watch. The rest of the cast provide support including John Turturro and John Leguizamo in small but amusing roles, and director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) utilises the lavish locations of Columbia. The surprising aspect of 'Collateral Damage' is that it does have a fairly interesting plot where audiences can relate to the whole premise of an ordinary man seeks justice on those who killed his loved ones. This plot might have been received better and less scrutinized had terrorism not been such prominent issue in the American psyche as of late. Either way, 'Collateral Damage' provides an entertaining escapist flare that shouldn't be taken to seriously. A solid action piece that has enough thrills and a semi-realistic plot, yet ultimately doesn't offend or get too clouted with sentimentality and sees Arnold Schwarzenegger back on solid ground compared to his last few films. I recommend 'Collateral Damage', especially if you don't take it too seriously!***1/2 out of *****!

Within weeks the events become yesterday&#145;s news and the official inquiry into the whereabouts of bomber &#145;El Lobo&#145; &#150; The Wolf &#150; comes to a frustrating standstill. So, against the advice of friends, the FBI and the CIA Arnie decides to take the law into his own hands and sets of for South America to track down The Wolf himself.This was one of the films that had its US released postponed following the September 11 terrorist attacks, and it&#145;s easy to see why. Even now the film would make for an uncomfortable viewing on occasions, with too many echoes from the real world, and Arnie&#145;s self righteous crusade in the jungles of South America is a little too over&#150;simplified and gung ho for this (supposedly) more informed day and age. To be fair to the filmmakers their black and white depiction of a courageous everyman (or should that be &#145;superhero&#145;?) taking on despicable villains is little more than a comic book tale, and would just as easily work if set in the wild west or some other far distant environment. It features the prerequisite all&#150;action scenes (including a spectacular jungle waterfall sequence and numerous pyrotechnics) that Schwarzenegger fans demand, and while both Arnie and The Fugitive director Andrew Davis have delivered better films in the past &#150; and recent events prevent it from being pure escapism &#150; Collateral Damage should nevertheless keep the undemanding multiplex viewer entertained on a Saturday night.

Remember that this was completed BEFORE September 11th.Now on with the film. Big Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a Los Angeles fireman named Gordon 'Gordy' Brewer. On his way to pick up his wife and son, he witnesses a bomb going off, killing his family. He is questioned by the CIA (or FBI) and shown some photos of the person thought to be responsible, and remembers seeing this person just before the explosion. Brewer then sets off for Columbia, looking for revenge against the man that planted the bomb, Claudio The Wolf Perrini. Brewer gets caught by The Wolf, but his wife, played by Francesca Neri, agrees to help Brewer after learning that her husband is planning to plant another bomb, this time in Washington DC. Brewer goes back to Washington, and manages to save the day, and is awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Some of the violence is quite brutal (the Mike Tyson scene for example), and the acting is not brilliant, but this is still quite a good movie. It was, however, missing a few things. First, it was missing Arnold's trademark one-liners. The only good line was near the end (The Wolf 'When are you going to kill me?' Brewer'Now!') and second, this is one of the very few Schwarzenegger movies where Arnold doesn't touch a gun.Overall, a good movie, but a touchy subject.

It's exciting, polished and it sports a more serious demeanor than most movies in its genre.  Arnold Schwarzenegger and his colleagues have nothing to be ashamed of. Yet because it had the bad taste to be released after the cruel events of September 11th it has been roundly lambasted in reviews and op-ed pieces as a piece of insensitive trash.  The question to ask, then, is Yes?  So what's your point?  Action movies have never been known for their deep sociological insights and to expect Schwarzenegger to have the precognitive foresight to predict last fall's horrors is ridiculous. A movie should be judged by what it is trying to accomplish and by its own merits. By these standards Collateral Damage turned out pretty good.Schwarzenegger plays Gordon Brewer, a heroic fireman.  Brewer's happily married existence is shattered when his family is caught in a terrorist explosion.  This sets in motion the revenge quest that takes Brewer from Washington D.C. to the jungle horrors of South America.  Schwarzenegger is obviously trying to change his image in this movie.  In stark contrast to his previous colorful and bombastic outings, Collateral Damage is admirably low key. Andrew Davis' directorial style would seem right at home on the muted Law and Order TV series.  For the most part, the remote and cool directing plays well with Schwarzenegger's heroics.  The only real problem is when the obligatory action set pieces kick in.  Because of the relative realism, when Schwarzenegger takes a sure-death tumble down a waterfall or survives a Hiroshima-sized fireball, the absurdity of the situation is heightened rather than the thrills.In a surprising move Schwarzenegger stretches himself and actually acts in Collateral Damage. He attempts emotion, character building, empathy and everything! More surprising still, he does a decent job of it and holds his own against his supporting cast.  New Zealander Cliff Curtis exudes way too friendly a demeanor for The Wolf, the satanic object of Schwarzenegger's wrath. Though I suppose that's exactly the way an effective terrorist would come across, the movie could have used the rabid ferocity of a Gary Oldman in the part.  Francesca Neri is intense and appealing as the woman Brewer feels compelled to protect.  As a CIA operative, Elias Koteas seems content to coast on his reputation for playing sleazy whackos rather than attempting a complex character.  The two best supporting players, John Leguizamo and John Turturro, have what amounts to extended cameos. Both deliver entertaining characters that disappear far to early Collateral Damage isn't a great movie; it's just a good one. Let's face it; Schwarzenegger's stock and trade are action supermen.  While seeing him in, say, The Cherry Orchard would undoubtedly be an experience, the man is really most comfortable turning bad guys to sushi with a chain gun under each arm. To start castigating him for making the sort of movie he's been doing for twenty years is ludicrous.  It is very understandable that September 11th has put many people off cartoonish violence. If that is the case with you, then please stay away from Collateral Damage.  Otherwise I recommend it as a very good example of the popcorn movie it was meant to be.

Collateral Damage is a surprisingly, slick and effective thriller that just doesn't focus on mindless violence for a change. At first I really didn't know how to exactly fit this film in my head, is it a drama or a revenge film. Well, it does lean on a more dramatic scale than most and it's definetly gritty and realistic in the way it portrays terrorists and the victims of terrorism.Director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive, Under Siege) doesn't go for the all out glamorous look of big explosions (there are a few in the film, but kept on a realistic level) and all out blood and guts violence.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Gordon Brewer, a firefighter and family man, who would do anything to get the job done or protect his family from all dangers. Then one fateful day, all of his very existence is taken away by a single bomb on a Colombian embassy, executed by a shadowy terrorist known as El Lobo aka.The Wolf played by Cliff Curtis. Inspite of the FBI's effortsto locate The Wolf, Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas) a sinister, but well intentioned FBI agent knows that something has to be done along with Brewer. As his wife and child are considered Collateral Damage, Brewer heads to Colombia to seek out and hopefully bring The Wolf to justice. There are alot of perfectly excuted sequences pulled off with perfection by Davis. Schwarzenegger finally gets to play a character alot more sympathetic than his usual hard edged ones and he is very good here. Elias Koteas, Harry Lennix, Francesca Neri, and Miguel Sandoval offer good support here. Very restrained and more human. Adam Greenberg's cinematography is excellent as always and features an interested, but too restrained score by Graeme Revell.

Nobody wanted to see a movie with terrorist themes so soon after the tragedy of 9/11 hit so close to home. But remember, Collateral Damage was completed long before 9/11. I'm guessing we will not be seeing another movie about terrorism for a while. But I went to see Collateral Damage trying not to think about the real life attacks that we all witnessed. I was able to put that behind me for the duration of the film, and therefore I found the movie to be a pretty good action picture. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a Los Angeles fireman who witnesses his wife and son killed by a bomb explosion set off by a Colombian terrorist. Schwarzenegger decides to take matters into his own hands to avenge the loss of his loved ones by going down to Colombia and track down this hideous bad guy. Collateral Damage has not fared well at the box office and in a way I can see why. We're coming up on the six month anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and some people refuse to see a movie about terrorism. That's very understandable, especially for those who lost loved ones on September 11. I don't know if this film would have fared better if it had been released before 9/11. We'll never know. But on the basis of what I saw while watching Collateral Damage, I think it's a well made action movie. Schwarzenegger is good too. I felt sympathy for his character.

I want super-slow motion with doves flying around. I want my hero to be almost invincible. I want him to be an excellent fighter, who always has some witty lines on his lips. I want to forget the real world, watch the movie, eat my popcorn, feast on the action, the explosions, the special effects and be entertained.Last Action Hero made fun out of action movies. It flopped. It's a great, intelligent movie, but hey.. don't make fun out of this genre. For that reason it deserved to be a flop. Collateral Damage is another approach. It's not making fun out of action movies, it brings realism and is very serious. No funny one-liners, no visual gags and no invincible heroes.Schwarzenegger plays a fireman and he remains so for the whole movie. He isn't a retired best of the best of the best army guy, who recalls his training and becomes a one-man fighting machine... No! He's a fireman. We don't learn if he's a good one, or the best. Just one of many, who lost his family. Driven by desperation, hate and bitterness he freaks out, seeks revenge and wants to kill the person who killed his family. But, he stays a civilian. He has no experience with guns, nor the needed connections to get one. In the whole movie he never holds a gun. He has no experience in close combat. If he has to fight, he's doing it in street fighting style.... Not very pleasant to look at, especially the 'Mike Tyson' part. Nor is he able to beat up more than two enemies alone. (Just think how many bad guys Schwarzenegger's character killed in True Lies' opening sequence without getting one lousy scratch!) Quite a contrast could be seen with the guerilla female. She *knew* how to hurt people. She knocked out one FBI Agent or disabled a civilian within a blink of the eye. Our hero, the fireman, was unable to do so. What he could do, was, what his job experience taught him Laying fire and knowledge to cause effective explosions. And he did plenty of it.That's what I liked, but also disliked. It made the whole movie so darn serious. Difficult to enjoy. It isn't nice to see civilians blown away. It isn't nice to see our hero suffering and being beaten. I didn't jump in the seat as the Americans destroyed the Guerilla camp, as plenty of civilians died. Even the last action sequence, as the bad guys get roasted, isn't nice, as our hero almost kills himself and has to run for his life. Darn! We couldn't even enjoy this part...The movie is well made. The story line isn't that bad for an action movie, nor are the plot holes big enough to make me Huh?. The end got me good though. Real good. I fell hook, line and sinker into it. Interesting how a heroine can be turned into an utter enemy within a few seconds... This was done in a very clever way. I really loved how you could see Schwarzenegger's character thinking and combining at this scene.Collateral Damage isn't a complete loss. One of the better 'Schwarzenegger-Movies', but it's just difficult to enjoy, as it's so darn serious.

When you see an Arnie movie you don't go to see the oscar acting. You go to see Arnie!! So yes EoD was a great movie. In 2000, I saw 6th day and I loved it. It reminded me of Total Recall. Now in 2002 I saw Collateral Damage, and it was Freakin awesome!! It reminded me of True Lies, and that doesn't happen often. Yes I did enjoy the 6th day and End of Days, but I will admit that when compared to Arnie's earlier work, they were a bit lacking. Collateral Damage blows both of those movies out of the water. This was a truly great Schwarzenegger movie!! The action was great! The story was very great, yeah, I can see why they postponed the release date! I think that every American should go see this and Root for Arnie and the USA! I personally believe that this is one of Arnie's best since True Lies. He is back and better than ever. This next year will be even better with T3 and True Lies 2. I can't wait for the DVD.  It will be amazing. If you are an Arnold fan, see this movie, you won't be disapointed. If you are an action movie fan see this movie, you also won't be disapointed. And finally if you are anybody see this movie. You will love it.

There seems to be something more than pure action. By more I am not referring to what happened to the poor Americans few months ago in comparison to the main theme of this flick...It is the action itself that has been changed. Hollywood film makers gathered a great deal of knowledge about guerrilla fighting throughout the past few years. The guerrilla action scenes are real, the weapons they use are real, their tactics as well. For example, it is very real that two helicopters can annihilate a terrorist base without a proprer air defence in a matter of minutes... With dozen of missiles and very few bullets. That is real, it is not real when people on the ground shoot at helicopters with AK's or even something heavier and then blow up the heli and become heroes. It is not real when the heli's use their machineguns to kill a group on the ground when a missile can get rid of them immediately. Helicopters even dont use a machinegun anymore (or rarely). It is also very real that a group of terrorists with a lot of missile launchers and fanatic courage can easily take over a prison on surprise. And some violent scenes (like the one with the snake) are a good representation of torture methods and violent behaviour among guerrillas and terrorists. It is REALLY as nasty as that. And there is no big difference between the bad and the good guys in a real terrorist situation. Even when the good guys have the edge on moral grounds, they are also nasty in action.If somebody wants to watch an action film that copies real combat situations I can divert you to Dobermann. Maybe Renegade Force aw well. The first offers more action than you can manage to see on the screen.I say these things cause I witnessed a real terrorist war a year ago... I am not proud of that.

As soon as the reel started for the preview, people started laughing and did not stop laughing until it finished.  Arnold just isn't the box office hero or draw that he used to be in such movies like Terminator 2, Total Recall, and Predator.  With that in mind also consider the fact that Collateral Damage was pushed back from its original October release date because of its content similarities to that of the attacks on September 11th.  I have to agree with Warner Brother's decision to push the release date to February 8th.  The content was inappropriate at the time, and feels to be more of an enjoyment now than it would have been back in October. 	Andrew Davis, the guy who brought you Under Siege, directs the movie.  Under Siege happens to be one of Steven Segal's better movies.  While the story is simple, it still remains entertaining.  The script, on the other hand, suffers from cliché phrases, and over simplified dialogue.  Although, what Arnold movie is know for its great script.   	Collateral Damage, an A-budget movie, delivers as the perfect B-film.  Our hero Gordon Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is introduced to us as a first-rate firefighter who has saved a great deal of people's lives.  He is happily married with a cute son.  Gordon is on his way to pick up his wife and son at the hospital when terror strikes.  A Columbian terrorist, The Wolf (Cliff Curtis of Three Kings), has planted a bomb outside of the hospital that explodes killing nine and injuring dozens.  Among the nine deceased are Gordon's wife and son.  Arnold's life is destroyed by the disaster, and Gordon Brewer is now out to seek Collateral Damage. 	 The Wolf retreats to the safe quarters of Columbia.  Arnold plots out his trip, and travels down to Columbia to seek revenge.  We are treated to an explosion extravaganza, and super-hero abilities that would rival that of Rambo.  Gordon is an unstoppable force merely from his L.A. firefighting training.  With the L.A. firefighter program being of such high caliber, they should be training U.S. Marines.  During one of Gordon's struggles, Andrew Davis pays homage to Mike Tyson.  Gordon is handcuffed and his only utensil he has at the time is his teeth.  He uses his teeth to bite the ear off of one of the Columbian gorillas.  We are also able to enjoy a unique yet chilling death with the aid of a snake.  The story further evolves into a somewhat predictable adventure, but the support of a plot twist helps change the stereotypical ending.  While not the greatest action movie of all time, it is certainly a step in the right direction for Arnold, and his career.  It is one of his better movies to date.  Even though the critics may have bashed this movie, I'm hoping, once again, that word of mouth helps spread the news of how descent this movie actually is.

After this critical introduction, allow me to provide a brief overview of what is perhaps one of the most atrocious pieces of film ever. Slated to be released last September, the film was delayed due to the tragic events of 9/11. Centered on the emotional subject of international terrorism, it bears uncanny resemblance to the events currently encompassing us in the world today. Cliff Curtis who has made a name for himself in such character roles in films as &#145;Three Kings' and &#145;The Majestic' demotes himself in this stereotypical character. As the leader of a terrorist group operating within Columbia, Claudio &#145;The Wolf' Perini plots to bomb important L.A. and Washington Government buildings; that is of course unless Arnold can stop him. Both of the United States' Government units cannot find this man, yet our unreluctant hero treads waters to Columbia to seek vengeance after &#145;The Wolf's' bomb kills off his family.      Arnold plays an all American fireman who loses his wife and son to the first of two plots to bomb the United States. The film opens up with the compulsory subject in action sequence where our subject (Gordon Brewer, played by Arnold Schwarzenneger) the great fireman; displays his skills in a useless and irrelevant scene. The film then cuts to Arnie spending time with his family before seeing them killed right in front of him. Unsatisfied with the progress the C.I.A. and F.B.I. are currently at, he does what no one deemed could be done. He crosses over to Columbia to track the killer down in a near impossible and all too-convenient scenario to track one of America's most wanted criminals. While the film may contain a shred of emotionalism due to current events surrounding us; Arnold quickly vanquishes those with flat &#145;one-liners', ridiculously over the top sequences and a poorly filmed adventure piece that will leave even the most faithful Arnold fan disappointed.      Andrew Davis directs the film and Warner Bros. makes no secret of plastering this all over the ads for the film. Yet the director that brought us &#145;The Fugitive', &#145;Under Siege' and who is currently working on &#145;Under Siege 3' does not capture the excitement contained within any one of those films. The film is a poor attempt at a comeback and relies on a formulaic approach in an attempt to win audiences over which in fact turns us away.     The first example is the comic relief in the film; we as the audience do not have the pleasure of seeing one useless character, but two characters. John Turturro is miscast as a raunchy Canadian who enjoys cheap sex and John Leguizamo is a drug dealer with aspirations of becoming a rap star. Does all this seem irrelevant? That is because it is. These characters appear and then disappear like a bad David Copperfield trick.      The film wants to be taken seriously but fails on every level. It just isn't fresh seeing Schwarnegger pitted against villains who we know he will prevail against. Even Arnie seems tired at replicating the same character only in different circumstances film after film. You can actually see the boredom on this man's face.       The film sets itself primarily in an uninteresting setting such as Columbia where Director Davis makes every effort not to show the beauty of the land but the violence and war that plagues it. The film seems to get itself moving at about the 1-hour and 15 mark when the film migrates to Washington where the second and final bomb is being planned to detonate. Yet, even with the films' &#145;I-see-it-coming-a-mile-away' twist at the end; it cannot redeem itself from a truly unsatisfying cinematic waste of celluloid.        How can it be taken as an action film when it contains no elaborate action set pieces, a horrible climax and absolutely no cohesiveness?  Arnold is made out to be a &#145;one-liner spewing' comic antagonist that cannot be taken seriously. Even though he does most of the damage manually, and does not carry a gun and goes off on a firing rampage, the film cannot mask that it wants to make Arnie seem intellectual in his doings, but unfortunately nothing about this film seems intellectual. This film will do more damage to Arnie's recovery as a veritable action hero than it will at the box office.

First, the depiction of Colombia, as a violent country where no one can put a foot on, is not only wrong but misleading. Second, the movie begins like a looking for the bad guy story, then turns into a commando story and then jumps again, losing all sense and ruining the fun. Last, it has glimpses of criticism about USA's intervention in other countries, but ends justifying everything they do, even killing more people than the terrorists. It doesn't worth mention the unbelievable situations that ocurr through all the movie. Good action sequences, and the usual action hero from Arnold is all you can look for. "},{"Title":"Haunting insight into our (Americans') not-too-distant past attitudes on terrorism","Date":"6 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  What makes the new Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, Collateral Damage, so interesting isn't the plot, or the action, or any of its superficial features. It's the haunting juxtaposition of its scheduled release amid the attack of September 11. The original release was supposed to be just after Sept 11., but was held back for obvious reasons, and has just now been released in theaters nationwide (February 8, 2002).As a movie, Collateral Damage is pretty darn awful - even die-hard Schwarzenegger fans will find it somewhat of a yawner. It's fraught with illogical sequences and yada yada yada. You know the drill. It doesn't even contain a good one-liner that we can quote with a grin. But what I found so fascinating is how the movie is now an unintentional historical document -- a sociological retrospective that peeks back into our not-so-distant past, when our casual attitude towards world affairs was so simplistic, simple-minded and oblivious. What's even scarier is to think that perhaps nothing has changed.The premise of the movie is standard fare for peacetime action movies Arnold plays a Los Angeles fireman whose wife and child are killed in a random bombing by a Columbian terrorist who is fed up with America's involvement in his country. He wants to bring the war to American soil by blowing up buildings and killing as many people as possible with hopes of changing American policy towards Columbia by leaving. No surprise there - that's not too dissimilar from Osama bin Laden's objective with the World Trade Center - to get us out of Saudi Arabia. But this movie was made pre-September 11, and in this film, the government decides not to pursue the terrorist (in effect, letting him win). This, of course, inflames Arnold, who dutifully goes after him alone. Trained only in fire-fighting, he manages to infiltrate Columbian grounds and get the closest anyone has ever gotten to what we are lead to believe to be the most powerful drug lord in Columbia. Yeah, right.What's interesting is how the movie unintentionally strikes a very profound chord given today's climate. The pivotal scene is where Arnold has planted a bomb next to the terrorist's head-quarters and is waiting for it to blow up, when the terrorist's wife and child - who are the same ages as his late wife and child - happen to be walking by. Unlike his terrorist counterpart, he wants to protect innocent people, so he screams out to get the woman's attention, unintentionally drawing attention to himself, thereby getting captured. Here, he is finally face to face with the terrorist who asks the crucial question So here we are, two men, both willing to kill for a cause we believe in. What makes us different from one another?Oh, the question rings so loud! The big, philosophical dilemma that defines the very paradox of terrorism. I'm reminded of the quote, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Could an Arnold Schwarzeneggermovie actually pose such wonderfully enticing questions and address them thoughtfully? Is this going to be America's awakening? Can we set aside patriotism for just a moment to recognize that this whole thing isn't quite so easy after all?Just as I was so eager to see something - anything - that might prompt meaningful thought, Arnold responds with the most vacuous reply possible, The difference is that I'm going to kill you. Oh, God. It's not even a campy one-liner ready-made for bumper-stickers on old Volkswagens.Of course, the movie was made before September 11, when they couldn't have taken into account the new perspective and awareness of real terrorism in our country. But that is what makes the movie so interesting! It highlights the huge, dramatic change of America's attitudes towards these issues from when such topics were considered light entertainment. Collateral Damage doesn't even try to be patriotic - rather, Arnold just wants personal revenge. I'm sure (if not just blindly hopeful) that if Arnold were to have made the movie today, the script probably would have been considerably different, even if the only difference was that his righteousness would be driven by his patriotism, not just his own grieving. Or, perhaps I'm just too optimistic about our own culture.

As a Canadian working in Columbia, John Turturro completely miscast has the best line in the film. Relaying his pleasure to Arnie about being Canadian, he states his greatest love about being Canadian is because nobody bothers him. Within the context of the film, that line was the only line to elicit a laugh on my part. Secondly, John Leguizamo is another example of useless comic relief. He plays a drug dealer with a good heart who has aspirations of becoming a rap star. Does all this seem irrelevant?

It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The writers are Ronald Roose and David Griffiths. The cast includes Arnold Schwartzenegger, Francesca Neri, Elias Kotaeas, Cliff Curtis and John Leguizamo. 'Collateral Damage' was, of course, one of those films whose original release date had to be postponed in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks. In this case, the sensitivity arose as a result of the film's storyline, which revolves around a group of Colombian terrorists determined to strike at targets on American soil. Schwarzenegger plays fireman Gordy Brewer, whose wife and child are killed in an explosion at the Colombian consulate in Los Angeles. Brewer, feeling that the U.S. government has little concern with exacting revenge from the terrorist leader responsible for the explosion, decides to mount a one-man crusade to see that justice is ultimately done. The film, obviously indifferent to its own need for plausibility, sends this virtually unarmed fireman into the unfamiliar jungles of South America to take on what appears to be the entire Colombian police force as well as the guerilla fighters whose actions resulted in the deaths of Brewer's family. Brewer, of course, despite his own inexperience and the formidable odds against him, manages to talk and/or fight his way out of every dire predicament before rescuing his nemesis' wife and their adopted son.

If anyone should be at the forefront, showing what terrorism can do, then it should be him. It was no surprise, that this film was held back for release, after the events of September 11, in New York. But a year on from that tragic event, this film helps to show what it would have been like to be a part of 9/11, as this movie is not unlike the real event that we all saw take place.Running late to meet his wife and young son at a downtown high-rise, Fire-fighter Gordy Brewer witnesses a catastrophic bomb blast kill his family before his eyes. The explosion is credited to `The Wolf', an infamous rebel leader in Colombia's decades-long civil war. The intended targets were members of the Colombian consulate and American intelligence agents. Gordy's wife and child are considered `Collateral damage', innocent people who lost their lives for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. When the US investigation into the Wolf's whereabouts stalls, Gordy realises that bringing the terrorist to justice is no longer a priority to anyone but himself. This movie has many facets that I liked. I enjoyed the danger that is always present in the story. Sure there are some victims in the movie, but it makes for very interesting viewing. I am certain that the screenwriters for the film could not have imagined ever resembling a story, such as that of September 11. While it might disturb some people from even viewing the film, it made me want to watch it all the more. The men who wrote it were Ronald Roose and David Griffiths.  The direction that Collateral Damage took was also good in my opinion. The director allows us to see a man suffer a tragic loss, be a very down to earth hero, in addition to being the man who wants to bring his family's killer to justice and try to help save his county in the process. Having Gordy as a fireman, and showing him saving lives was an ingenious move from director Andrew Davis. The pace this film has is good, as it never stays still for too long. I also found the locations that were used for the story, changing between America and Columbia, to be a good mix from Davis. What's more, the landscape used for the Columbian part of the film was excellent.Arnie is a big action star, and some people might say he is one dimensional in the movies that he performs in. However his role in this film, for me shows that at least he can act. He is a very &#145;gentle giant' of sorts in Collateral Damage. I guess seeing your family killed in a bomb blast would have that effect on a person. Gordy's character is a very smart one, as he uses all of his abilities to help him at all times. You genuinely feel for Gordy, as he is one man that does not deserve what he has gotten out of life. The back up cast for Schwarzenegger is of the finest quality. While some people will not like the evil character of &#145;The Worm', I like who performed Claudio, that being Cliff Curtis. His character has ice in his veins and will stop at nothing to bring the certain American ideals to their knees. The role that surprised me the most from &#145;Collateral Damage' was that of Selena. Italian born Francesca Neri played her very well. When you finally think you can trust a person, out of the blue comes the one person you should never trusted. The minor and comedic roles taken on by both John Leguizamo and John Turturro were of the finest quality. Look out for Leguizamo, in the funny Martin Lawrence film, &#145;What's the worst that could happen?'I am sure that many people will say how could there be such film as this, showing such a similar storyline to that of 9/11. My answer to those critics is that 9/11 happened many months after this film was started, and was not released until the tragedy had time to pass. So, I say that it is merely a coincidence, not a sick joke, although I am certain many &#145;moviegoers' might not think so. I applaud what and how &#145;Collateral Damage' was presented. Furthermore, if such events in America had not have happened, then this film would be remembered as just another one of those &#145;action' movies that we would all dismiss as nothing new.

If your spouse was killed by a drunk driver, you'd probably not rest easy until the jerk was caught - if then. But most of us would let the cops do their job, even though we anxiously await results and some sort of closure. But see, that's the key. You'd wait there, a bundle of nerves. Arnold Schwarzenegger goes to Colombia.Gordy (Ah-nuld) is a heroic fireman in Los Angeles. He's late to pick up his wife and kid at the doctor's office, and BLAM! A bomb blows up the whole area, killing his wife and son (there were dignitaries in the area that Colombia terrorists were targeting). The CIA knows who the bad guy is - he calls himself El Lobo - but the catch is that no one's ever seen his face. But Gordy has. He saw him seconds before the bomb went off (although of course, he didn't know then) and therefore becomes the only American to be able to recognize the Numero Uno Bad Guy.Figuring that El Lobo's hitailed it back to Columbia, Gordy follows. He sneaks in as only Ah-nuld can, through Panama. This marks Schwarzenegger's wandered south of the border, following Commando (1985) and Predator (1987). He's a man on a mission to find and dispense of the man who murdered his family.This is certainly one of those movies you wouldn't believe if it were shown as a true story, and that's partly because some of the stuff Gordy does lies somewhere beyond the realm of credulity. But that's somewhat beside the point. You don't watch this movie as if it were a documentary, you watch it as if it were a cartoon, which it surely is. Heck, even the acting's cartoonish.Getting into Columbia isn't easy, but of course Our Man has a plan, and even when things go awry, Our Man somehow triumphs. Because he can do that, you see. It just wouldn't do to have him be anything but a superhero. If you or I or anyone else tried half the stuff Gordy did, we'd be caught, gutted, and disemboweled before the first commercial on NYPD Blue. But not Gordy, who's tougher than steel.But one thing worth mentioning is that this movie wouldn't work with just any beefy actor. The fact that that audience buys into the whole Arnold-as-Superman thing is a testament to his appeal; if you didn't believe Gordy could do it, you'd have no movie to watch.This movie was held back from release following the September 11 attacks, and some of the parallels are eerie. There's an attack in the movie on American soil. How would we have reacted to that scene prior to September 11? Probably wouldn't have raised an eyebrow over it. Now, however, the scene is viewed in a whole new context. That scene - and the subsequent violence - are now lent a distinct air of reality and believability, further buttressed by the inimitable secure personality of the giant Schwarzenegger.Arnold returns to his tried-and-true Predator-Commando-Terminator roots here, and he pulls it off quite well, considering he's now over 50. A twentysomething couldn't do the stuff he's doing in this movie. Okay, so maybe his double's doing a lot of it, but still - the man's still in great shape, doing what he loves to do and what we love to do - kick major bad-guy ass.I'm giving this movie relatively high marks because I like this kind of movie - a fast, violent action movie.

In fact I haven't seen a more feasible action movie in a long time. Many action movies are beyond cartoon level of ridiculous.IE 'Commando' had excruciating moments of 'cant happen' action like 20 militia shooting machine guns at Arnie from 30 feet without hitting him once NOW THATS UNBEARABLE TRASH ! This movie never went beyond reality, sure there were many explosions and gun fights but the director seemed to be trying hard to keep a reality level of good guy/bad guy action throughout.The scenes went from the bustling city center to the dense quiet of jungle keeping good visual variety.The acting was all decent and even at my critical best I did not have any problems with it. No actor tried too hard (making it hammy) yet they all tried hard enough (making it quality).The camera work was smooth and stylish enough to keep the film flowing without much distraction.The storyline had a nice touch to it near the end that put icing on an already decent cake.To summarise - good acting, camera work, directing, storyline, scenery and good vs evil emotion made this an enjoyable movie.Not Aliens or Shawshank Redemption level but has quality all the same.

Even when released finally in 2002, the big budgeted action sequences did not succeed in making the film a decent box-office success.It was also Arnold Schwarzenegger's last few films before he ran for Governor, and in this film, he plays yet another heroic figure, a fireman called Gordy Brewer whose intrinsic responsibility is to save lives. However, his family became collateral damage in a Columbian freedom fighter's bringing of terror onto the shores of the USA, and this caused an about turn in Brewer's character into a life-taker, seeking revenge.Given that the government's hands are tied, Brewer decides to go at it alone, planning to go after The Wolf whose organization admitted responsibility to the bombings that killed his wife and child. The movie then plods along as we follow Brewer's infiltration into Columbia and to the terrorist organization's base camp. He meets up too with The Wolf's wife and kid, and somehow forms a bond with them, given his own loss.The action contains nothing much that has never been seen before, so those who are expecting thrills and spills along the lines of the fantastic Arnold vehicle True Lies will be disappointed. However, things pick up towards the last 30 minutes into the show, as the plot contains a slight twist that catches you off guard and makes you go now why didn't I think of that. It kinda plays on the assumptions of man, and why couldn't it be possible I'd say.The violence begets violence message in this movie is obvious from the onset, and makes you wonder about the world today with the terrorist threat always looming. Some scenes like the planned attack on the train station might also ring too close for comfort, given that real train attacks in Madrid and London did happen since the movie's release.Nonetheless, this movie is still watchable, and perhaps it is inevitable that you wonder why Arnie's star seemed to fade out during his last few films. Perhaps it's too much of the same thing without much variation on the heroic action. Nothing much can be said of Arnie's acting, but it's pretty amazing the amount of mayhem a lone fireman can inflict!

I was curious how the Americans - who love wining on screen even the wars that they lost - will deal with this so painful actual theme.Not to be mistaken, this is just a Schwarzenegger movie - it cannot get to good, it can't be true, and you should not expect any psychological or artistic revelation about the roots of terror, or the pains of the victims. Arnold will take the gun and solve it all his way. Moreover, the film was made neutral and politically correct by picking some consensus bad guys of Colombian descent. So, if you are in the mood to see Schwarzy saving again the world (or just some historical buildings in Washington DC) from terrorists go to see it.

I think you can strike a balance between these two ways of making movies.Those who blame action film makers for lack of realism forget that an average person already has realism in his life with its limitations, rules, laws, bureaucracy, politics and lack of interest in your personal troubles. If I need realism, I can just go to Chicago south side, get robbed by some friendly neighborhood minorities because I'm white, only to see complete lack of action or response from the Chicago police, because they are playing politics and will not protect me for fear that those same neighbors who robbed me will start yapping all over, call Jesse Jackson and it will affect them in an undesirable way (I'm citing an actual reported incident here). Sorry, folks, but that's the ugly reality.An action hero is a way to relax and get away from all that and finally see a man get things done and set things right, for once be strong and empowered. People identify with a hero. They sympathize, they believe it would be great if they were so empowered. That is why people watch action movies.Collateral Damage is somewhat far-fetched, as others have mentioned, but it does give you that feeling of empowerment, that an average Joe can, in fact, stand up and avenge the death of his family in spite of all those political games our government loves to play.Two things I found irritating in Collateral Damage was the ending and Francesca Neri's silicon lips that make her look like a cheap blow-up doll (pay attention to her face when she examines photos at CIA headquarters). Arnie closes the door and an explosion takes place behind it. The heavy metal door gets blasted off with the concrete wall so hard that it flies and Arnie is dragged across the floor. He walks back and is attacked by the terrorist who isn't even burnt, even though he was in the middle of the explosion (not like Arnold behind a concrete wall.) I think that was making it too far-fetched.But don't let the ending discourage you from watching the movie. It's really not important, we all know the bad guy always dies in these stories.

That's why they first must learn what not to do. Collateral Damage is a fine example of how to insult the intellect of the audience and spit the message in their faces.The bigotry that is palpable in this excuse of a fictional work is unbelievable lame. Every old trick in the history of screen writing is used in a self-indulgent manner. There's even more! Davis is a great director as he proved in The Fugitive, he could mix action and drama in a superb way. But here he fails miserably because his lead actor (Schwarzenegger) is too dull for this role and the action is lack. Schwarzenegger in the last years tried to play new roles. But it seems that the only one that succeeded in creating a different image for the Austrian-American actor was James Cameron in True Lies.If someone supposes that the writers made an investigation of how is the life in Colombia and the liaisons between carteles and authorities of both countries, then it would be wise for that person to read more serious newspapers and watch less movies like this one. This film had its controversy because the people of Colombia felt this movie as an insult. Colombia is a poor country that has suffered terrorism for decades and that is not something that should be used by opportunist filmmakers avid of profit.

Though this has its good and bad points, I must credit Arnie on being able to sell me on his character. He did very well in this film, displaying range and capability with the role.--The twist-in-the-end at this movie came as a shock, but an entertaining one at that. It did have a couple of plot holes but I was convinced, and enjoyed the sudden change.--The action sequences in the film are entertaining and well-filmed, as well as being clever and necessary to the plot of the movie.THE BAD--John Leguizamo, while a funny actor, had no place in this movie and neither did he in the story of the film. What purpose did all the drug-making scenes have to the plot of this movie? Nothing. They were an unnecessary, annoying time waster in the film.--At 2 hours, the movie is longer than necessary.

We waited until it was shown on cable, and her first response was that she was entertained. She enjoyed seeing many Mexican people and sites being touted as Colombian. She enjoyed hearing many Hispanic people who only knew English try to speak their lines in Spanish, and do this poorly. She enjoyed seeing an Italian actress portray the Colombian wife of a terrorist. From my point of view, as a Maryland, USA citizen, nothing looked abnormal to me. I was fully entertained by Arnold's typical brawny acting and the story unfolded with its twists like a well oiled drug smuggling cartel.John Leguizamo and John Turturro portray some eccentric characters who Arnold encounters and they were memorable.

Admittedly, I wasn't expecting a great deal and indeed the movie is guilty of some rather unrealistic scenarios. What I did find compelling in this movie was the dynamics of the guerrillas  and the CIA and Arnies character. We have Arnies character (and the CIA) heading off to seek revenge for the bombing in LA and his family's death and find that a driving force for the terrorist (The Wolf) is the murder of his daughter by persons armed and supported by the CIA. In fact those CIA sponsored thugs, very nearly killed Arnie a few times - Who are the terrorists?Some of the other comments about this movie were by people who found it in  bad taste - perhaps what it did was leave a bad taste in our mouths because we had to ask that question and some of the events in the past year do not seem so clear. Do not get me wrong - acts of violence are cowardly and abhorrent and should not be tolerated. But when a western centred paradigm is the group that gets too label others as 'terrorists' or 'radical', then we need to consider all of the implications of that. It is easy to forget that there are people caught up in the battles that define the dominant and the radical - similar to the peasants in this movie who were just trying to eke out a living, but being targeted by both sides.But all that 'deeper reflection' aside - I did enjoy this movie for what it was .. an action movie, certainly not in the genre of what we would be used to seeing Arnie in (but considering his political aspirations understandable). I rated it a 7/10.

Of course it can be seen easily as a story of the tragedies of terrorists and the sense for revenge but I felt it went in another direction. In the beginning he is one type of hero (fireman) and at the end another type, but along the way he is a changed man. Has he changed for the better? Like most heroes (in the mythic sense) the main character is essentially single-minded and psychotic. When the tragedy of Schwarzeneggar's family hits home he sits and mopes for a while and eventually gets pushed over the edge (see him going beserk in the office, and the careful showing of his over-sweet home life with his family before the event in contrast?). These metaphors only build to show a man who is now gone over the edge.Fine. He takes matters almost immediately into his own hands to go to Columbia and deal with the situation with apparent ease (and with more stealth than the officials who should be better at this than him). This can be seen as an example of the duress he feels (know the one about the mother lifting a car to save her child?) and why he manages to achieve this with little personal injury. He, bit by bit, achieves his final goal in the film with a brief conversation with the main terrorist about the difference between both men's motives for killing in the first place. But this is all beside the point.Basically the film is about a man who has a breakdown and goes to Columbia to exorcise his demons and gets awarded a medal of honour (a national hero, right? - but wait a minute, the terrorist is a hero too in his country) in the end for doing so because it also happens that his actions work conveniently for the government. The other characters have no depth (due to Arnie's tunnel vision throughout to achieve his goal) and this is why the movie is odd. It appears to reward the end and not the means. How it all seems to be in the end and not the motives of a bloke who is obviously unbalanced. Remember the line from Cliffhangar? Kill one person, and you are a murderer. Kill thousands and you are a conqueror. It is all interpretation. I suppose we could also say that being single-minded and doing all we can to defeat evil also makes one a conqueror and hero. One to be emulated or admired. Regardless of the means. the two main characters are not as different as they appear in their own perspective. Propaganda.Nonetheless, for Hollywood to present a story of this nature (and there have been many previous) has allowed me to enjoy this film with the above view in mind as it smacks of the hypocrisy we see in all Nationalistic story-tellings. And let's face it, clichés are good entertainment! So don't watch this film with the mind that wants to see action. View it and reflect upon it. We have all been there in one way, shape or form.

This is a picture that introduces quite a few controversial topics, mostly involving terrorism, how such behavior originates, and how it relates to the United States' government;  ambitious stuff for an actor mostly known for delivering trademark quips and mowing down vast armies of extras. But in the end, Collateral Damage is little more than a high-gloss B-picture about a guy out for revenge.  It's better than, say, any of the Death Wish films, but that's not exactly a shining compliment.Gordy Brewer (Schwarzenegger) is a Los Angeles firefighter (you can except a gratuitous opening scene where he performs bravely in the line of duty) with a beautiful wife and young son.  But his ideal life is shattered the day a terrorist bomb kills his family.  The culprit, a terrorist known only as The Wolf (Cliff Curtis), is reportedly in Colombia, so Brewer goes on a South American journey to exact his revenge.  Not everything goes hunky-dory as Brewer has to face gun-toting guerillas/terrorists, and discovers that The Wolf has a wife and son of his own.As far as pure escapism goes, Collateral Damage is probably the least enjoyable of Schwarzenegger's films in years.  Sure, it's better than Batman and Robin and Last Action Hero, but it's a grim thriller, almost intent on making sure the audience feels depressed from beginning to end (with only a glimmer of optimism in the final scene, which I actually found kind of touching).None of the topics Collateral Damage addresses is given much thought or development, but it's interesting enough to see them present in a Scwarzenegger thriller.  While Cliff Curtis' villainous Wolf is hardly given enough characterization, his brief background is compelling and mildly thought-provoking.  It doesn't necessarily make him sympathetic, as might have been the filmmakers' intent, but I at least didn't view him as a complete one-dimensional monster.Schwarzenegger attempts to genuinely act, and surprisingly, he's not bad. I could never really picture the guy emoting grief (even though he did so in End of Days) but he pulls it off to a reasonably believable extent.  Don't expect any of his typical smirks or deadpan one-liners.  They're almost completely absent here.  As The Wolf's wife, Francesca Neri is solid and convincing, but sometimes feels like little more than a plot device.The story is mostly straightforward, with maybe one twist near the end that actually surprised me.  Taken simply as a tale of revenge, the script isn't really that bad; hell, you even feel sorry for the protagonist.  However, viewed as an attempt to examine terrorism, the film is mostly a failure (but not an entirely uninteresting one).Most bothersome about the film (and ultimately the reason why I just can't recommend Collateral Damage) are the action sequences, which lack the oomph and energy I've come to expect from a Schwarzenegger film.  His previous movie, The Sixth Day, suffered because it lacked genuine gunfights. This time around, he doesn't even pick up a gun!  I'd heard the NRA was breathing down his back, but this is just ridiculous (glad to say this disturbing trend was only temporary, as Terminator 3 featured more gunplay than Schwarzenegger's last four films combined).I've always been a fan of Schwarzenegger, who radiates a screen presence that most (inarguably superior) actors can't match on their best days. Collateral Damage is strictly for his fans, but don't be surprised if even they find themselves disappointed by this serious, humorless affair.

The terrorists in this case, are tied to the drug traffic from Columbia. Fire Fighter Gordy Brewer (Arnold Schwarzeneggar)loses his wife and son in a terrorist bombing in Los Angeles. When he hears his family referred to as collateral damage (i.e. innocent victims) he goes ballistic. Ambitious CIA agent Brandt (Elias Koteas), who has his own agenda, purposely misleads Brewer. Brewer takes it upon himself to go to Columbia to seek out the terrorist Lobo (Cliff Curtis) whom he recognized in police videos as the man he saw just prior to the blast that killed his family. In Columbia, Brewer is befriended by a woman, Serena (Francesca Neri) and her son Mauro (Tyler Posey). Serena and Mauro turn out to be Lobo's wife and son. She agrees to help Brewer escape and identify her husband's next target and stop him. Ah, but not before Arnold employs his pyro-tech expertise to blow up the drug camp. There are a few unexpected twists in the plot before the bad guys get their just desserts. Actually, this isn't a bad action movie. The special effects are very realistic and Arnold is not the super human hero that he usually portrays. Director Anthony Davis keeps the action and the story moving with hardly a moment to catch your breath. It is a little unbelievable though, that an ordinary fire man could just up and enter forbidden territory in Columbia single handed. But hey, we're talking Arnold. Curtis makes a convincing Lobo, a man who allows no margin for error. Neri, an Italian actress, keeps you guessing in terms of her character and Koteas is good as the self serving CIA agent. In all too brief appearances are John Leguizamo and John Turturro as two of the people Brewer encounters in Columbia. When all is said and done, Collateral Damage is one of the better Arnold flicks of late. And you know what? If I'm not mistaken, old Arn doesn't fire a single shot throughout the whole film.

His capacity for self parody has made most of his worst films at least entertaining and while gritting his teeth and offering bulging veins and muscle for the camera to drool over like a lot of other action stars, he's always managed an invisible wink at the audience to let them know they are in on the joke, too.  His films are pure fantasy, entertainment.  He asks to borrow a couple of hours of our life and tries, I believe, to give us our buck's worth.  His titan outing, of course, was the Terminator because it's easy to believe this hulking, body building icon could be the thing that will not stop.  Collateral Damage, however, is his mother of all turkeys.  I resent the 911 infusion because I believe they who choose the release date were respecting not the tragedy, but the dollars.  If they had believed (which might even be the case) that people would flock to see an American fireman take on terrorists, they would have blown the opposition out of the way to get it on the screens, never mind the collateral damage it would incur.  Instead they, in my opinion, knew they had a turkey and wanted to smear it with patriotic spin (which I also resent...patriotism is real, movies, even those about patriotism, are not) to bolster take.  I suppose that's just the industry squirming and rushing and flinching, to position themselves for the best financial leverage.  I also suppose some will see that as a positive thing.  But the problem with this movie is it isn't an Arnold film.  He isn't an actor that can convince you he's someone else other than Arnold.  He doesn't work in a socially and politically relevant film.  Robert Redford can do that, Al Pacino can do that, Robert Duvall can do that and there are others (Russell Crowe can do that), Arnold cannot.  That doesn't mean Arnold can't step outside his Terminator stamp.  He can and I believe he will and I believe he will make a movie that causes serious cinema buffs to drop their jaws.  But not in this kind of movie.  It will be a movie where his sense of humor, his film history and those wonderful one liners will hit with just the right timing, sparkle and snap.  He needs to drop the way too young wives and girlfriends (he's long in the tooth, as they say, and he shouldn't try to hide it).  He slides down an jungle hillside well, but Michael Douglas did it better and with a cinematic classic ending in Romancing the Stone.  Everyone has gone over the falls, shouldn't survive but does.  None of his character's psychological progression is coherent and the story couldn't decide if he was a physical action hero or an everyman.  Arnold doesn't need scenes where he weenies.  This was junk caught up in real tragedy that, I believe, tried to capitalize on history.  But mark my words, Arnold will find the story, the screenplay that is just right for him and he will be doing an opus for us.  Just because he was involved in this Collateral Damage mess doesn't mean he's down and out.  Go rent True Lies, vintage.

We all know about the first occasion the movie was all set to be released, when an actual terrorist attack on the United States made the IRA- and PLO-sized bomb explosions in the film look almost quaint ... and made an Arnie flick on the subject of terrorism seem ill-timed.So the film ended up being released in February 2002, by which time the RESPONSE to the terrorist attacks had made it out of date.  In the film, the dominant political faction counsels restraint rather than retribution; it's assumed without question that the United States will not start a war or even alter current foreign policy simply in order to track down and punish a single criminal ... and then there's the scene in which Arnie plants a bomb next to The Wolf's house, and it's about to go off, when he sees a woman walking past with her child, and he notes the analogy between what he's doing and what The Wolf did to HIS wife and child (alas, repeated footage underlines the point for us, as though we were stupid), so he yells and pushes the woman and child out of the way of the blast - and in so doing, alerts The Wolf to the presence of the bomb and spares his life.  While this footage was sitting on the shelf, far more innocent civilians were killed by American air raids than died in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania combined.  Maybe it SHOULD have been released the previous year, after all.Not that it would have made a difference.  The movie's real sin is that it's a dull affair, with characters shuffling through their parts, in flat, uninspired scene after flat, uninspired scene, to the strains of one of those wet-blanket musical scores that keeps telling us to stop enjoying ourselves - in the unlikely event that we were.  Revenge is a poor subject for an action film anyway.  We want the hero to be DOING GOOD, dammit! - at least ostensibly.  I'm glad that Schwarzenegger's stereotypical out-for-blood grieving parent (I've just lost my son, therefore the State Department must give me whatever I want) schtick gave way to something resembling restrained good sense, and I wish I could say that the film's change of heart on this point was due to more than just muddle-headedness (but I'm not sure that I can).I kept thinking of True Lies.  Now THERE'S an Arnie movie that would have been in poor taste coming out in late September 2001.  I'd feel indecent watching it even now (at the time of its release the supposed vilification of Arabs worried me less than the extreme indignities which Jamie Lee Curtis's character had to suffer, although I enjoyed the movie so much I found it hard to bring myself to worry much about either) ... yet the real difference between True Lies and Collateral Damage is the difference between the living and the dead.  Even the difference between the two sets of characters is the difference between the living and the dead.  Is there a SINGLE character in Collateral Damage with clear, comprehensible motives?  Actually, there are two a couple of minor Columbian criminals who get perhaps ten minutes of screen time between them.  But you get my point.

Collateral Damage is about a terrorist attack on a U.S. major building or two &#150; a subject not considered to be saleable to the American public in recent times.But now it's here, and it's over there, and it's what it always was, a predictable B grade Schwarzenegger movie.In this one Arnie has his family killed by the terrorist early in the film and then hightails it to Columbia where he does battle with the terrorist army cartel who were responsible for killing his son and wife.Collateral Damage is interesting though because of the character of the terrorist called The Wolf who is played by Cliff Curtis. He surprisingly gets to state his case clearly, to define his ideological reasons for hating the U.S., which would have been unthinkable not many years ago. Things have changed.The Wolf certainly isn't innocent, he blows up children and gets his funding from the drug trade, but he's not painted completely blackly. That might present some problems when we're supposed to really hate the baddie.But of course Arnie does what Arnie does and proceeds to orchestrate numerous murders and explosions. He plays a remarkably talented 54 year old Fireman. But he's dour and relentless. There's none of the self mocking humour that has made Schwarzenegger the star that he's been for decades.And what of the U.S. government? At one stage they subdue Arnold's character with a very nasty looking stun gun which fires out darts and then immobilizes its victim with electricity. I hope they don't really exist. They probably do.The other notable factor in Collateral Damage was the female star Francesca Neri, who really was stunning. The two Johns, Leguizamo and Turturro also turn in notable performances as does Elias Koteas as agent Brandt.

After the dire 6th Day, which left a bad taste in my mouth, I felt that a similar flop from Arnold would mean a similar standard but no, it was pretty good at times. The film has had a lot of press attention that has obviously had a negative effect on the gross but I see no reason to have delayed it because of some sparse similarities with the sept 11 tragedies, terrorist films are so common I don't see why this was delayed and other flicks like for instance Air Force One and Passenger 57 were not temporarilly taken off the shelves. The fact that terrorists are involved and that Ahh-nuld plays a fire fighter are where any similarities end. It would never have been accused of cashing in on the disaster as it was shot months before and it is truthfully a whole different aspect of terrorism. When all is said and done though and the dust has cleared over a lengthy wait what you get is a fairly routine action thriller. All the wait and a big let down for most people including the most ardent of Arnie fans, reflecting on its dismal box office display not yet recouping even half of its 85 million budget after about six or seven weeks and not likely to either. Anyway the film itself has a standard plot, Gordy Brewer witnesses his wife and sons death in an explosion, and is the only man to have seen the terrorist's face. He is known as the wolf and is fighting for a cause to help innocent Colombians. The film is really a showcase for some great pyrotechnics and generally lots of loud banging explosions. It also features some second rate cgi affects and also Arnold in a jaccuzi with a cgi waterfall behind him amongst other things. The start of the film is great, an introduction to Gordy a heroic firefighter in the middle of a burning building. The first half hour or so of the film has a good thrillerish feel, nicely paced with the explosion and Arnold showing some of his best acting work by looking upset when his family die, his acting in this film is probably his best ever but we all know that a Nic Cage or Tom Cruise etc would have shown a more convincing grieving father. The fact that Arn shows a slight lack of emotion to such a dreadful situation undermines the rest of the flick slightly but this is true of most films with an action star as opposed to an actor. As soon as he is captured in a Colombian prison the film drops well paced plotting and turns it into an action attack, this was a little disappointing but the action scenes, while lacking in style, where big and brash, the 85 million being put to good use. The film also features a plot twist that I saw coming from a mile off but actioners are never known to be clever. This film does take itself very seriously and Arnold is in good form, this film is a worthy edition to his CV and is his best role as an everyman kind of guy. Truthfully though, I and most others like Arnie as a Cyborg or as a wise-cracking one man army in films which are tongue in cheek and mindlessly destructive.Anyway the supporting cast are quite good, Cliff Curtis is okay as the wolf and Elias Koteus as the somewhat dirty FBI agent. Also the stunningly attractive Francesco Neri is good as the wife of the Wolf. All in all the opening firefighting scene and the last fifteen minutes stand out in an otherwise average action flick. Amazingly as well, as many have pointed out, Arnie never uses a gun once which is good, and this film also does have some gruesome moments such as a particularly nasty death scene involving a snake. Overall an passable enough way to spend your afternoon unless Blade 2 is showing at the same time of course.

I enjoy watching Arnold Schwarzenegger in an action flick, and this one being his first in a year or so, I was expecting something a little better than what I saw. The beginning of the movie is where we meet Arnie's wife and kid. We don't become too emotionally attached to them, though, so when they die, I pretty much didn't care. So now Arnie is very mad, and decides to catch the terrorist who killed his family. As soon as he steps foot in Colombia, it's all action, and no acting. There's a dead guy here, another one over there, and...BAM!!! He kills the bad guy and the movie is over. If you're the type of person who is more into the emotional side of the characters (ME!), I recommend not seeing this movie. But, if not, there's plenty of action here to keep you entertained for the 105 minutes it runs. Nice try Arnie.

The problem is, Arnold is the wrong actor for the role. He plays an everyday working joe a fireman yes, with nerves of steel, but still just an ordinary guy trying to live his ordinary life. Arnold is ill-suited for such a role; his characters have always been un-ordinary and larger than life, even before the heavy actions started. I can easily imagine Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford in Collateral Damage, playing guys who are out of their depth and know it.This movie also tries to be morally balanced. Although it does portray the terrorist El Lobo as, well, a terrorist, it strikes a moral equivalency between drug-money terrorism and U.S. efforts to counter it. At one point, Arnold's CIA antagonist even shouts, I fight terror with terror! Not only does this gravely mis-portray the real American efforts in Colombia, it leaves the movie's viewers confused as to who Arnold's real enemy is. I guessed that the movie wants Arnold to be a man caught in the middle -- isolated on all sides, in deadly danger from the terrorists, Colombians and the CIA alike. Yet none of these agencies actually harm him when they have him literally in their hands, although El Lobo does give him a big whuppin' or two. But there are other credibility problems, for example, a big fight in which two people are engulfed in flames and their vehicle is blown to smithereens, and they are not even slightly harmed. Even my 14-year-old son groaned when he saw that.Also, don't miss the innocent peasants under helicopter attack who cravenly bunch up together in a lean-to to wait to be killed, instead of scattering into the jungle like anyone with a the common sense of a brick would do. Ditto for the scores of terrorists standing erect in an open field while the helicopters mini-gun them. In the old-style Arnold movies this sort of thing was okay because the movies were cartoons, but Collateral Damage wants to be a serious movie with important lessons. However, serious movies portray people acting seriously, not like brain-dead nincompoops.The one nice twist was the secret antagonist, whose identity I won't reveal because it would be a big spoiler. Overall, Collateral Damage is a disappointment, and a movie I won't rent to see again when it comes out on DVD. Too bad, because I like Arnold. I guess I'll just watch Predator tonight, or maybe Die Hard, where the lead actors fit the role.

Originally scheduled to open in October, 2001, the film's opening has been delayed for four months because it was deemed too intense a subject for release immediately after the incidents of September 11th. My opinion is that the studio should have shelved this movie and it will suffer from comparison with what we have been through.It was truly painful to watch this film.  Arnold Schwartzenegger and the other actors do a good job, but the subject material -- a fireman who loses his wife and child to a terrorist bombing -- is just too difficult for this time in our history. It's difficult to imagine that the studio thought this film would EVER be acceptable. Even hardened critics in the audience winced at the similarities to what we have endured -- the bad guys, although supposedly of Colombian extraction -- look a lot like the Middle Eastern men whose pictures we have seen over and over again -- sans the turbans. Honestly, I don't know how good the box office for this movie will be. Maybe die-hard action movie buffs will go to it, but I cannot recommend this movie to my audience -- not because it is terrible, but because it is not entertainment in my mind.  The scenes in the fire and the explosions in and around buildings are just too close for comfort. One woman shrieked out from the audience, Give me my two hours back!  I can understand her comment completely.  In this case, I really wish I had gone to a coffee house for a couple of hours and listened to music.

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a firefighter who witnesses his wife and son become victims of an explosion that was meant for a public figure. He awakens in a hospital after being struck by a car then realizes that he had spoken to the terrorist briefly before the incident. He ventures to Columbia with vengeance in mind resulting in a complete lack of common decency. A sequence where Schwarzenegger goes down a waterfall looks too lame for words. Director Andrew Davis showed great skill when he made The Fugitive but here he rushes too quickly into action scenes. Schwarzenegger grunts and groans his way through complete absurdity before emerging as the hero. Elias Koteas is cardboard as a cop. Francesca Neri plays the terrorist's wife. Cliff Curtis plays the terrorist whose prime focus is to be Schwarzenegger's punching bag before the film's end. John Leguizamo appears to be part of his worst film since The Pest. Whatever the so-called message may be, this film exists primarily to showcase implausible action and as much violence as one film can possibly contain. The result is a film that should suffer collateral damage.

His first couple of attempts, End of Days and the Sixth Day were fun outings, but only End of Days was a commercial success ($200+ million globally) and Collateral Damage was the next one after these two movies - sadly it was both dull and a commercial failure &#x96; it probably accelerated Schwarzenegger's decision to head into politics, albeit with a reasonably successful third outing in the highly entertaining T3 still to come. In fairly derivative plot, the fireman Gordon Brewer, played by Schwarzenegger is one of his less accomplished performances takes the law into his own hands to avenge the death of his wife and child (a theme also present in End of Days &#x96; but since its just some narco-terrorists rather than the devil it does quite measure up!) - While some of the action sequences are reasonably well handled, what could have been an interesting idea looking at moral and ethical dilemmas is tossed aside into a run of the mill action plot, with some very predictable plot twists and a rather anti-climactic climax. There is a complete lack of a sense of fun and excitement that was a hallmark of a lot of previous Schwarzenegger films. Certainly with the large number of writers there is some evidence that rewrites may have diluted the original concept. It certainly a far cry from the excellent work director Andrew Davis did on the Fugitive, and in many ways is his least impressive work.A major disappointment and very little to recommend it.

Ten years after its release, this feels dreadfully out of place and unwelcome, like a wino at a cocktail party. But even without context, this movie isn't the best example of the genre as it's quite pedestrian, playing fast-and-loose with logic and offering little in the way of entertainment and thrills.Gordy Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a fire-fighter who tragically loses his wife and child (Lindsay Frost and Ethan Dampf) in a terrorist bombing. The FBI quickly establish the culprit - a Colombian rebel by the name of Claudio The Wolf Perrini (Cliff Curtis) - but are unable to act due to forthcoming peace talks between the government and the rebels. But Brewer is not a man who takes things laying down and after a quick bit of research on the internet, decides to pursue The Wolf to Colombia himself. But when it comes down to it, will Brewer be able to kill the man who murdered his family especially when Perrini's wife Selena (Francesca Neri) gets involved in Brewer's private quest for vengeance? Back in the day, movies like Collateral Damage came along every few months or so and involved little more than constant explosions, heavy gun fights, a pouty woman who might be a love-interest or not and the lead actor grimacing enough to convince you the CG was real. And this movie isn't one to buck the trend - Arnie can sleepwalk his way through roles like this and at times, he almost seems a little bored. Frankly, you could give him a headband and a longbow and you could be watching Rambo when the Governator is running through the jungle. But despite it sticking doggedly to the action movie genre, there seems a distinct lack of enthusiasm behind the picture as though they realised that the market for this type of movie is drying up. After The Matrix, films like this simply don't cut the mustard any more. The plot was crippled by impossible coincidences and the CG looked poorly executed - despite the numbers of people shot, I don't recall seeing a single bullet wound anywhere.It may be no fault of the director Andrew Davis (himself, no stranger to action films) or Schwarzenegger but Collateral Damage was never going to reignite the genre in the way the studio predicted. Compare this to another of Schwarzenegger's earlier action films - namely, True Lies. That film was just as ridiculous as this but it realised that it could be played for laughs as well, that a little fun could be poked at the genre - take the moment Jamie Lee Curtis drops an Uzi down stairs but the gun goes off and still takes out a number of baddies. Collateral Damage, by contrast, feels stubbornly miserable - when the inevitable ending comes, there is no sense of joy or pleasure in the outcome. The film needed a little relief from the action but offered nothing except more fisticuffs and explosions. And before you remind me about the plot-twist, I'd like to say that it was obvious from the start but still didn't fit it in with what went before it. If you want your action movies to be relentlessly average then Collateral Damage will do the trick but personally, I like my movies better made, more entertaining and not riddled with problems with cohesion. No wonder Arnie felt politics was safer...

Musclebound Arnie appears somewhat bloated and shows his age a bit in this one. Though good with bench presses, mountain climbing and covering rough terrain are simply not his bag...and it shows. With Yankee fortitude...and an Austrian accent...he strives on to meet his targets...and to give 'em what fer. There are so many twists and turns in the plot that it loses its believability at some point.

The directors just don't take time to establish the characters of anyone...save the protagonist, and we are pretty much left to our own designs...or if we are lucky, we will get some explanation from one of the film's supporting players after the deal has gone down, and while they are counting up the body bags. The obvious references in this one are to the FARC and Shining Path groups in Colombia just prior to 9/11...but the release date was so close to 9/11 that it was held back for a couple of years.

Obviously he is devastated, a Colombian terrorist called Claudio Perrini (Cliff Curtis) AKA The Wolf claims responsibility for the bombing in retaliation against American occupation of Columbia. The CIA or FBI are helpless as the senate orders immediate withdrawal of American troops from Colombia which annoys Gordon, in fact it annoys Gordon so much he intends to illegally travel to Colombia himself & kill Perrini despite the army of guerrilla's Perrini controls. Sounds like a sensible idea to me...Directed by Andrew Davis this is far from classic Arnold Schwarzenegger, Collateral Damage is alright & passes the time but just didn't do much for me. The script by David & Peter Griffiths just isn't that involving or interesting, it's rather sedate, the action scenes are flat, forgettable & bland while it has the usual assortment of silly plot holes. The plan to blow the FBI guy's up at the end was so intricate & relied on countless things going to perfection that it stretches the films already thin credibility, you can't make a snake slither down someones throat, the snake wouldn't voluntarily slide down someones throat, what about the guy's gag reflex & the snake would probably die before the person. Then there's the scene at the end when two people are engulfed in flames yet reappear moments later without so much as a singe, you cannot slide down elevator cables with a belt wrapped around your hands because the friction would tear through the belt & then your hands like a knife through butter & I wouldn't advise anyone to break open a metal pipe that carries flammable gas with an axe because the axe hitting the metal pipe would almost certainly cause a spark & ignite the gas which would then explode & blow you to pieces. This could have been a great action flick but lightweight action & fight scenes (Arnold never fires a gun on screen for heaven sakes!) along with the unpleasant depiction of all Colombian's being either drug lords, corrupt or terrorists doesn't help it's cause.Director Davis doesn't really do anything special here, the action scenes are dull & lack excitement or any real mindless violence. Arnold doesn't even get any cheesy one-liners to mumble, so what we have here is an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick without much action where he doesn't even fire a gun & not a single one-liner is sight, why is the question I ask here, why? Then of course there's the general theme of the plot about terrorists wanting to blow United States landmarks up, considering world events it just doesn't sit easily or make for particularly pleasant viewing. Collateral Damage was originally to be released on October 5th 2001 a mere three weeks after 9/11 & it was pushed back until Februray 8th 2002, despite this it still grossed $15 million at the box-office during it's opening weekend.With a mega budget of $85,000,000 give or take a few million Collateral Damage doesn't feel like a particularly big budget film, sure it's got Schwarzenegger in it (rumour has it he was paid in the region of $25,000,000 to star in this so maybe that's where most of the $'s went, I love his quote when he said 'money doesn't make you happy, I now have $50 million but I was just as happy when I had $48 million'!) & it has that Hollywood polish about it but the action scenes are surprisingly subdued, no-one of any other note is in it & even the special effects aren't exactly brilliant. The acting is OK but largely forgettable.Collateral Damage is an OK time waster, don't take it too seriously or don't expect another Arnie classic then you may find enough here to keep yourself quiet for an hour and forty odd minutes but it's a close run thing. Not one of Arnie's best but it's still a hell of a lot better than Kindergarten Cop (1990)!

Like the guy who says, The death of his wife and son were... (look at screen and raise one eyebrow) ...COLLATERAL DAMAGE.My bigger contention with this flick is that the plot holes are so HUGE it makes it impossible to enjoy.   For instance, the huge plot twist that is meant to shock the audience is that the terrorist's wife, who we are led to believe is good, is actually the terrorist El Lobo herself.  But why did she get on the plane with Ahnold in the first place?  Why didn't they kill Ahnold in Colombia?  That plot twist makes absolutely no sense at all.

The clunky accent and cubist facial features make it hard for him to convince as an everyman. In `Collateral Damage,' the latest entry into the uncertain pantheon of violent post-September 11 entertainment, he seems desperate to spark a late-career renaissance of the Schwarzeneggar action flick. After vanquishing Old Scratch himself in `End of Days,' what better candidate than Suh Ah-nuld to take on a Colombian bin Laden stand-in?        When his wife and son are killed by a terrorist bomb, L.A. firefighter Gordon Brewer (Schwarzeneggar) heads to Colombia himself to hunt down `the Wolf,' a mean Colombian rebel who likes to blow up Americans to force the US out of Colombia's civil war. Brewer is remarkably successful where the CIA has only met frustration and red tape &#150; after landing in jail, and befriending a kindly cocaine producer, he manages to infiltrate the rebel zone and blow up the Wolf's house in a matter of days. There is, of course, more to the story than this, but there isn't much point in going through it. Suffice to say that lots of stuff gets blowed up good, and those who are due their comeuppance receive it in traditional Schwarzeneggar fashion, by which I mean they are violently and mercilessly killed, just like Brewer's family.       The film continues the glorious tradition of right-wing vigilante fantasies in which one good man does the dirty work of the masses that hamstrung governments and agencies are unable to finish due to pesky laws and checks on their power. Imagine Frank Lindh heading to Kandahar to take out the savage hordes that brainwashed his infamous son, and you've got the driving force behind `Collateral Damage' in a nutshell. Funny that Brewer doesn't appear to feel particularly better after doling out piles of carnage in the jungle and back in the states. Alas, if this is the fate of the freedom-loving Americans who have the cojones to rid the world of evil ethnicities, so be it. If nothing else, the sight of Arnold forcing out the odd phrase of Spanish, as if he were trying to expel a chainsaw caught in his throat, almost makes `Collateral Damage' worth a look.

He doesn't ever wield a gun in the entire movie, even though the theatrical trailer erroneously shows him running through the jungle with an AK-47.  Most of the movie has Arnold just sort of wandering around while other people shoot each other and blow each other up.  Every now and then he looks confused and kills a grand total of about 3 people in the entire film, only one with his bare hands and one who was actually one of his friends who he just started fighting randomly.By the end, you'll have been rooting for the bad guys had their plot not been so similar to real-life the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon.  Politics and historical coincidences aside, the overall effect of this film is still joyless and empty, it's even less fun than the similarly dry film THE 6TH DAY which Arnold last starred in.  The supporting cast consists entirely of cameo throwaway roles, such as John Leguizamo and John Turturro who both appear for about 2 minutes each.Needless to say, you're listening to one very disappointed Arnold fan, one who came to this movie expecting Arnold to return to his action roots and not even getting that.  I bet if Arnold didn't cost $20 million dollars, the producers might have the budget to afford more impressive films.

Such is the case with `Collateral Damage,' directed by Andrew Davis, which after that infamous day in September became much more than it was before, with an impact dramatically heightened in significance.  Because now it's more than just another action film with political overtones; now it's a story to which millions of people can relate and identify, and which for some may even provide a kind of catharsis, inasmuch as it puts a face on terrorism and addresses it on a very personal level, which to many just may bring about some very needed closure that has not yet been afforded by real life.	Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Gordon Brewer, a Los Angeles fireman whose wife and young son become victims of a terrorist attack aimed at officials influencing U.S. involvement in Colombia.  Naturally, Brewer wants those responsible brought to justice, and when he discovers that this is not a priority on the government's agenda because of some political ramifications, he decides to take matters into his own hands.  He learns that the man responsible is a Colombian terrorist known as `The Wolf' (Cliff Curtis), and that he's already fled the country and returned to Colombia.  And though Brewer realizes that what he wants to do is seemingly impossible, he is adamant in his purpose and determines to go to Columbia himself, to find the Wolf and settle the score.	Director Davis and screenwriters David and Peter Griffiths are to be commended for their caring and astute treatment of an extremely sensitive issue.  To be sure, at it's core this is an action film-- and they give you plenty of it-- but they keep the focus on the drama of the story, which elevates the stature of this offering tremendously, taking it well beyond what you'd expect from a film of this genre.  Certainly, the things Brewer does in this film in reality would fall into the realm of improbable/impossible; but it definitely touches a collective nerve, and cinematically, it works.  The action underscores the drama, and it's all expertly crafted and delivered.  The F/X are excellent, but most importantly, Davis manages some credible character development, which is really what sells this story.	Arnold Schwarzenegger has to be given a nod of acknowledgement for this one, too, as his performance here is arguably his best ever.  It may not be Oscar material, but he displays a sensibility in creating his character and a sensitivity in his delivery that makes Brewer believable, and someone to whom you can relate.  Schwarzenegger approaches this story (and his character) from a dramatic, rather than an `action' perspective; gone are this trademark puns, quips and asides that would have been so out of place here.  This is simply not the kind of film that lends itself to any kind of comic relief, which the filmmakers obviously understood; it's almost as if they had some prescient knowledge that the theme of their film was going to be too serious to play around with.  And their good sense and intuition not only made the film more than it may have been in lesser hands, but it gives Schwarzenegger the opportunity to demonstrate that there is more to him than just being an `action' hero.  Older now, he has seemingly matured as an actor; there's still some `Terminator' in him-- there always will be-- but his portrayal of Brewer just may be a pivotal point in his career, possibly affording him expanded opportunities for future projects.  His work here is impressive, and hopefully it's an achievement that will be recognized as such.	As `The Wolf,' Curtis does a good job of capturing the sense of a man who has all but lost any semblance of his humanity, and in the heinous acts he perpetrates becomes the personification of evil.  His is the face of terror and fear, and though his motivations are touched upon in the film, there is no attempt whatsoever to absolve him of his crimes, which is reflected in the remorseless way Curtis portrays him.  He's a truly believable villain, which is one of the reasons this film works so well.          	Also turning in notable performances are Francesca Neri as Selena, a woman whose presence initially seems indicative of one thing, but which ultimately becomes much more; John Turturro, in the brief, but interesting and pivotal role of Sean Armstrong, a Canadian plying his trade in Colombia; and John Leguizamo, as Felix Ramirez, a guy who manages to prove the old adage that if you play with fire, eventually you get burned.	The supporting cast includes Elias Koteas (CIA Agent Brandt), Jsu Garcia (Roman), Shelley Malil (Doctor), Tyler Posey (Mauro), Kevin Beard (Phipps), Rodrigo Obregon (Rodrigo) and Jorge Zepeda (Rocha).  When this movie was made, the filmmakers, of course, had no idea how significant their story would soon become.  The initial release of the film was delayed in the wake of 9/11, which was wise; any time before now would have been too soon.  Now, however, `Collateral Damage' seems entirely appropriate, inasmuch as it is a reflection of something that is all too real, and a reminder of things we'd just as soon forget, but must not.  It may be more disconcerting than entertaining, but then again, so is life.  Be advised, this one hits close to home; but thankfully it was in the hands of filmmakers who obviously knew what they were doing, and cared about the message they were imparting and how it was delivered.  This is a film that is going to tap into some raw emotions-- and it demonstrates what a powerful medium the cinema is, and what can be accomplished by those with the necessary talent, capabilities and good sense to use it wisely.  I rate this one 8/10.

Acting in movies like Terminator and True lies, directed by James Cameron, he achieved the success but I guess that choosing him for the sequels of those movies has been a great mistake and his starring will transform all that in a flop. Very few fans still go to see him in a movie and the last 3 or 4 cashed very little to the box office in proportion of the costs. How producers can be so stupid to pay $20M an actor that is over and his fame send away the moviegoers instead to bring them to the theaters. Any case Collateral damage could cash a little more with some younger and cooler actor like Vin Diesel but it still should remain a banal movie, full of dejavue and a little beat boring.

While I do realize a movie about terrorism is a touchy thing now and its not easy to look at acts such as what happened that day and isn't now, but this movie was set to release without 9/11 in mind.  Jordan is ignorant in his comments about the movie where he said for example (without him seeing the movie by the way) Making the character a fireman who becomes a vigilante is an insult to firemen who became heroes after the terrorist attacks.  First off, why is it that firemen became heroes after the attacks and weren't considered by heroes beforehand anyway, second, is it a matter of difference what profession Schwarzenegger has in a movie when he will do all of his vengeance no matter what the script has him doing before his family gets killed?  And why is it an insult anyway?  Wouldn't some firemen be happy to see somebody like a Schwarzenegger fighting against terrorists after all the s*** they had to put up with months back?But these are all just quandaries I though while watching Collateral Damage, which is deep down a good old A-nuld action flick with a good dose of action provided showing that even in his early-mid fifties Arnold can still entertain even if is isn't as great as it was in the Terminator days.

The government doesn't want to act even though it knows who planted the bomb, so Gordon takes matters into his own hands.

John Turturro has a small role that I enjoyed, but on the whole the acting is about what you would expect from an Arnold movie.

His acting is underrated and he has shown some of the most amazing staying power of any actor in Hollywood.  I'll admit he has made some duds (Neither Junior nor Batman & Robin really did it for me), but people see a couple bad movies and see such a physically imposing man with an accent and assume that all his movies are crap.  This could not be further from the truth.  In all honesty, Arnold is one of the best actors Hollywood has seen and even borders on real heroism with all his charitable works and the inspiration he provides for countless people.With that out of the way, I must say that I absolutely loved Collateral Damage.  It was one of Arnold's best in a while, and that's saying something, contrary to what most people would have you think.  It had action, drama, REALLY cool plot twists, and amazing acting by Arnold (Yes, that's right, I said it...go ahead and send me hate e-mails about how stupid I am for thinking that, I stand by my statement).  I won't give away any of the movie, but I strongly urge people to not dismiss it based purely on poor reviews or by a relatively low IMDb rating.The entire controversy surrounding Collateral Damage, as you probably know, is about its similarity to the events of September 11th.  Originally planned to be released less than a month after September 11th, it was pulled immediately and released on February 8th.  Now, I have heard some things on TV with people talking about how savvy Arnold is by utilizing the tragedies to get his movie to make more money.  Hearing these naive elitists talk about stuff like that makes me ashamed that our education system can produce such completely willfully ignorant people.  I will say it right now Arnold would NEVER EVER use something like September 11th to get his movie more money.  What options did he have?  If he released it at the original date, people would have definitely claimed he wanted to cash in.  If he delayed it any longer, people would have thought it was made after September 11th.  So what could he have done?The saddest part of these negative reviews is that many of them are by people who HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THE MOVIE.  Many people are so predisposed to hate Arnold and his films.  It honestly makes me sick that people condemn him so much.  I would even go so far as to say that some of these people have political agendas.  Being one of the few Republicans in Hollywood (though he's married to a Kennedy...man, that's gotta be weird), I'm sure Arnold is less readily accepted as some of the more typical Hollywood stars. By people berating his films so much without really having an open mind about them, or in some cases not having even SEEN them, they show why some people hate America as much as they do.  People will believe what they want to believe, and if you want to think that a bodybuilder with a thick accent can't produce a good movie, you will believe you're right no matter what you see on the screen.  But just know that by denying yourself the possibility of liking Collateral Damage and by trying to force your views on other people, you make all of us who can appreciate Arnold ashamed to share this otherwise great country with you.  Thank you.

Lots of action, but little excitement.  It's not different from the standard rock-em sock-em action flick.  I usually love Arnold's work, because it's usually original and filled with humor.  Arnold only says two funny lines in the whole film!  I miss his one-liners!  I guess he was trying to flaunt his dramatic skills--the limited amount he has.  Who can forget the scene from Total Recall in which Sharon Stone, his wife, begs his forgiveness  You can't kill me, I'm your wife.  Arnold responds, Consider this a divorce.  And he shoots her dead.  Another historical Arnold scene is in True Lies in which he is flying a plane with his terrorist enemy hanging off the edge of a missile.  He says, You're fired, which is exactly what he does when he fires the missile, and sends the terrorist flying through the air like The Rocketeer.  Now THAT'S the Arnold I know!  Other than the climactic action sequence--which is a little far-fetched, but entertaining nonetheless--there aren't too many scenes that got me reeling with excitement, urging me to root for Arnold as he kicks ass. The storyline is weak, and full of odd coincidences.  There's one moment in the film where Arnold gets thrown in jail, and his cellmate (John Turturro) happens to be a fellow American with a guerilla pass.  Then the jail gets set on fire--like always, in these movies.  Hey, they gotta break the hero out somehow.  And this is another one of those caring-father-suddenly-becomes-GI Joe plots.  OK, so there have been other Arnold films with that setup, but if Collateral Damage were more entertaining I would've overlooked the goofs in the plot.I would consider this a low point in Arnold's career, though most say End of Days is his worst flick.  I'm not saying End of Days had the smartest plot in the world--some of it is downright preposterous--but it was energetic and fast-paced and kept my attention, while Collateral Damage--though directed by the talented Andrew Davis who made The Fugitive--is quite dull.  Unless you're the world's biggest Arnold fan, I suggest you wait 'til this one hits the video shelves.My score  5 (out of 10)      "},{"Title":"Ridiculous","Date":"9 August 2006","Score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Arnolds 80s movies and early 90s movies are (most of them) great. Something must have happened during the second half of the 90s. Suddenly, Arnold started to make bad movies like End of Days, T3 and this one. Of course, he would make one half-entertaining and quite alright movie named 6th day which would satisfy some of his fans but disappoint most of them. But of all those movies, this must be the baddest of them. Let me tell you why.First of all, the story is anything but original. Original and trend setting story's could be seen in many of Arnolds early films, like Terminator, Conan, Running Man and the most typical Arnold-movie of all time; Commando. The story of a fireman who lost his family in a terrorist attack and seek revenge is both ridiculous and unrealistic. I can understand any mans sorrow in such incidents, but no one tries to kill the terrorist after the attack. What I'm trying to make into a point here is this Take 9/11 for an example. Many men lost their families. So far, no one has taken revenge for that. If I woke up any feelings with that example, I apologize. What I'm trying to say here is this the story in this movie is the first step to the annihilation of Arnolds career. I wrote 'not original' up there, and it still ain't. Well, I don't mean that the exact story has been done in many movies, I mean the entire revenge concept.Second, its a kinda silent movie. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean that there is no gunfire or explosions or so, cause there are. Plenty of it too. What I mean is, there are many silent suggestive scenes where they try to make a drama out of it. Those scenes are horrible. Just like in many action movies, where they try to make strong dramas out of it. I think its superfluous to mention them, thats why there are no examples. Another point I'm trying to make is that Arnold shouldn't be in those positions where he have to be dramatic. That's exactly what ruined Commando. And it ruined this movie too. Not completely, its just one of the many bad parts in this movie.Third, the characters are bad, unrealistic and stupid. Take Arnolds character, Gordy. He suffers from heavy temperament problems. Not only he become angrier than necessary, his temperament shifts a lot. And he is not the only one with that problem. Selena Perrini (Francesca Neri) has the exact same problem. First moment, a lonely sad mother trying to take care of her son. Next moment, a ruthless killer. The bad guys so sick and unrealistic that I wont bother describing them with another sentence than 'plain stupid'. See the movie and you'll understand exactly what I mean.Further reasons is a weak production, bad directing and a ridiculous script. I suppose I don't have to describe that any more than I just did, right? Arnold is currently governor in California. A major disappointment since he should return to the movie world and make more movies in the same style as the ones he made during the 80s. But I guess he needed an excuse to not continue with turkey movies like this one. For gods sake, Arnold! I want another Total Recall or Red Heat!

In particular, Collateral Damage was delayed due to its themes about terrorism and its marketing campaign had to be reworked. Regardless, the film was still a disappointment. Once upon a time, Arnold Schwarzenegger was the #1 box office champion who could not go wrong. However, his vulnerability showed following the disappointment of Last Action Hero (1993). His star was on the wane following such box office flops as Batman and Robin (1997) and End of Days (1999). Collateral Damage certainly wasn't going to revive Arnold Schwarzenegger's career. In what was ominous signs, Arnold Schwarzenegger's glory days were as good as over. His career was briefly resurrected following the success of Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines (2003) before he made the big decision to switch from Hollywood to politics, in which he was later elected as the Governor of California.Collateral Damage is about a Los Angeles firefighter Gordon Brewster (Arnold Schwarzenegger)who's wife and son are killed in a bomb blast outside the Colombian Consulate building as well as killing seven others. The person behind the bomb blast is revealed to be a terrorist calling himself El Lobo (The Wolf) also known as Claudio Perrini (Cliff Curtis). The Wolf further explains that the bomb was in retaliation for America's oppression of Colombia. Brewster is angered when the victims including his wife and son are considered to be collateral damage. CIA Special Agent Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas) has been tasked to take down The Wolf, but Gordon Brewster wants to cut through the red tape and take down the wolf himself. Also assisting Brewster when he reaches Columbia is a mysterious woman named Selena (Francesca Neri) who Brewster saves from an attack in Columbia along with her young son. Also appearing in small roles are John Leguizamo and John Turturro.The movie itself is very unrealistic and very dated. In fact this could have been a movie that could have been made in the 80's. And don't get me started on the fact a fireman wants to go down and take on the terrorists himself. Get real. If the character was a member of the police, military or even a government agency then the film would have been more believable. But a fireman?! That's where the film fails. Even for an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, this film is notable for his character in an action movie that does not touch a single firearm. Instead he uses makeshift bombs and takes on terrorists in hand to hand combat. It is not realistic to have an everyman take on terrorism and then see him in action kicking butt. Arnold is also on the negative side of 50 which makes him a bit too old to be taking on terrorists that he could have easily done with ease 10 years earlier. The story was very uninspiring, predictable and derivative with several inconsistent plot holes. If Arnold Schwarzenegger was not in Collateral Damage, I would not have given this movie a second thought. Collateral Damage is an unusual miss for Andrew Davis, director of The Fugitive (1993) and Under Siege (1992).While Collateral Damage may have suffered at the box office due to the events of September 11 2001, that aside it would not have made the slightest difference.

Does that mean it should have been a hard hitting realistic expose on terrorists? NO!! This is still a Schwarzenegger action movie and a good solid one at that. In fact, this one stands out due to the emotional content of some of the scenes. Its true that the film at first glance might seem like it has a little more depth than it actually does. It tries a few times to carefully show a moralistic lesson on terrorism and third world countries but even still you have to realize that this is a vengeance action flick. The best scenes without a doubt are in the end during the final battle. No one does final villain battles like Arnold that's for sure. Its significantly less campy than some of his other films but its entertaining, has a ton of action, explosions and well directed scenes and that was enough for me!! Arnold Schwarzenegger's Gordy Brewer is a very different character for him. He's very sweet and wholesome and has this distinctive everyman quality to him. He shows some real emotion during some of the more intensive sad scenes that really impressed me. He has such emotion in his eyes when he family dies that it'll break your heart and bravo to him for showing such depth in an action flick. Francesca Neri is the wife of our main villain and terrorist. She is alright in her role though sort of monotone with a stunned expression throughout the movie. I would have cast someone with a little more life to her. Cliff Curtis is our big bad villain and he does a very good job. The script really doesn't give him a lot to work with considering how vital his character is to the story. Still he looks the part and is appropriately evil enough to make Arnold's hero have his adversary. Their final fight is as good as I expected it to be.

He tells a good story with what otherwise could be just a mainstream schlock script. Is it a perfect film? No. There was some missed potential certainly in the film.

The action isn't non-stop, even tough its Arny alone vs the world once again. Its more like of a suspense with some action parts. Anyway its really hard to explain, i guess as a movie by itself its not bad, but as an Arny movie you would expect more. I saw tough that he was 50 something filming this, he dosen't look like it. Lets say its one of those forgettable Arny movie but if you want to watch them all, its decent, go for it.

Because honestly, I couldn't tell whether it was intentionally over the top or serious, or maybe even both. The way that the movie wrapped itself in an American flag and blew stuff up one minute and then bashed the US military for slaughtering innocent civilians the next made the politics of the film really enjoyably hard to pin down. i don't want to say that the movie was a spoof of itself because I think that it did embody some sincere patriotism. It's just that it spends a while pandering to a conservative audience and then goes 'oh liberals, you know we love you guys too' and then goes straight back to what it was like before. I don't know, maybe it was just selling out to a wider audience because they knew that it's sometimes mindless patriotism would offend people (It kind of offended me, though it was mostly harmless. Aside from all the killing.) But in any case, I enjoyed the movie both as a spoof and a straight forward action film... no matter how annoying the stereotypes got.

The first phase, Getting Started, begins with Pumping Iron and continues with Hercules In New York and the like. Phase 2, Establishing, contains the entertaining but otherwise routine action thrillers like Commando, Raw Deal and so on. Phase 3, Blockbusting, has all the films which AS will be remembered for - The Terminators, Predator, True Lies, Total Recall, as well as a handful of comedies ranging from the excellent (Twins) to the not-so-hot (Jingle All The Way). To some extent this phase suffered from a need for each movie to cap the one before, something which became more difficult towards the end (Eraser, End Of Days, The 6th Day). And there was Phase 4 a.k.a. Collateral Damage.Collateral Damage, the last film made before medical issues retired AS as a major action movie star (and before he became the Governator) is a film which would slip easily into Phase 2. As a routine gung-ho action thriller, there isn't a vast amount wrong with it. Except that it's a Schwarzenegger movie.Arnie had become his own worst enemy. He had delivered so consistently that, by the time this movie came around, we wanted so much more and, in that respect, it became an ignominious capstone to one of the very best careers as an action hero in the history of cinema.

I had fairly high expectations for this movie, expecting it to be a good, suspenseful action film. Instead, what I got was a generally dull, clichéd action film, even if it does indeed have a degree of suspense in it, especially at the end. An action movie without that much action might be redeemed by a good story and good acting, but Collateral Damage, I'm afraid to say, has a clichéd story and mixed acting.The story revolves around a firefighter named Gordy (Gordy? Why Gordy?) Brewer and we see him rescue people from a burning building at the start of the film. Here, I thought, this might not be such a bad film. Unfortunately, this turns out to be the movie's best scene, aside from the explosive sequence at the end. The movie then degenerates into one of those revenge-driven stories which gives Gordy an excuse to kill people and blow stuff up.Here I come to Collateral Damage's most fundamental flaw. The action often lacks excitement, as Gordy only intermittenly kills people with crude weaponry. This deeply disappointed me, as I expected Arnie to blow them all away like he did in Commando. Instead, he hides a lot and makes friends with one of the enemy, which in turn leads to a predictable twist. (Reindeer Games anyone?)In the end, you have to wonder why Arnold Schwarzenegger signed up for this. Collateral Damage is not a terrible movie, but it's lack of action and anything other than intermittentent periods of suspense cripples it. Unless you're a really big fan of Arnie, I would advise you to skip Collateral Damage.

Still, it helped out in this piece of flag-waving schmaltz, in which he feigns being a German engineer in order to infiltrate a Colombian terrorist/drug baron's stronghold to seek revenge for the murder of his wife and kid.This film is rubbish.  Whichever bright Hollywood spark pulled it for re-editing post 9/11 should have had the courage of his convictions and abandoned it lock, stock and barrel.  The movie's feeble attempts at political contextualisation are an insult to the real victims of terrorism, and Arnie's even feebler attempts at evoking grief equally so.  There's quite an irony in that the revenge motivation underpinning the ludicrous storyline illustrates in microcosm President George W. Bush's own campaign against the perceived phantom axis of terror.  As in End of Days, Arnie affects the conscience he misplaced in Predator, Commando, Red Heat and all those other gunfests earlier in his career, but it just doesn't wash.

This made this film kind of a Taboo.Unfortuently the brewhaha surrounding this film is unjustified as it has nothing to do with 9/11 at all, except perhaps both have Firefighters as heroes.Schwarznegger plays a firefighter who loses his family to columbian terrorists - and vows for revenge. Fortuently the US army is looking for a burned out, semi-suicidal maniac to take out these terrorists and willfully funds Schwarznegger's storm of everyone evil (ie. terrorists).Whilst there are some good points to this film such as it points to US sanctioned CIA black ops in Columbia and what a terrorist is and how to understand is the first step of defeating terrorism. There is also a pretty good twist in the film. However, this is all glossed over with its sheer mind-numbing boredom.Sure, there's lots of pretty action sequences, LOUD explosions and lots of social commentary in the film - it isn't enough to make this film move. What I don't understand, and I find perhaps the most disturbing, is that Schwarznegger himself becomes the terrorist - yet he never stops (although he does at one point) to think that he is becoming the very thing he wants to destroy.Anyway, its a pretty long and dull film.

He sits in his house, drinking tea from a bespangled-banner mug and planning revenge. Unsurprisingly, at the end he gets it and is a hero. If you're going expecting to see Arnie kick some butt (in a sea of bad acting and explosive spectacle) and emerge not only as victor but also as morally vindicated, there's no need to hesitate before the box office.But throughout the entire film, Davis weaves in endless tangential plot lines concerning the duplicity of Arnie's character's actions, comparing them both directly in the action and through the script with the assumed evil of terror. I'm particularly impressed with the end of the film - there's almost a bomb unaccounted for (it's not, listen to the final voice-over), but this is characteristic of the self examination that I (as the audience) am forced into.All the right questions about the downside of unilateralism, complacency and paranoid insularity are asked with no answers given - but the good guys still win.

Oh, it's easy enough to tell who the hero is.  He's either Schwarzenegger or Willis or Segal or Stallone.  But the problem is with the plots.  There is usually some terrible personal offense committed against the hero, which makes his later propensity towards violence more rational.  Here, for instance, Arnold's wife and child are blown up by Colombian guerillas and become collateral damage.  So revenge becomes his motivational engine.But that's a comic-book explanation of motive.  Now that we know why he's so brutal we can sit back and enjoy the gore that follows.  Less naive movies can have a hate-filled protagonist too, but without the pop explanation. Take a classic noir film like On Dangerous Ground.  Robert Ryan as the violent cop hasn't got such an easy excuse.  He's simply empty, a moral void whose character develops in the course of the story into a more mature and complex and vulnerable person.  (Ryan's worst enemy is Ryan, not some faceless gang of terrorists.)  Nothing like that ever happens to one of these modern guys.  Stallone is captured by the enemy, stripped, giving him a chance to show off his muscles, and dipped in pig crap and that's that.This is a pretty ridiculous movie, all in all.  Arnold takes a couple of terrible beatings without getting a bloody nose.  He's blown up at least twice, dispatched villains with guns, fists, fire axes, and what not, falls down elevator shafts, and Lord knows how many exploding fireballs he escapes.  He wrenches off heads, breaks necks, kicks men in the jewels, throws women into electrical gadgetry that curls their hair for them.  He wipes out the gang of drug lords and saves Washington, DC.  The villains are pretty mean too.  Like the Nazi spies (or the Commies) of old they execute any of their own people who make mistakes.  They crank one guy's jaw open and cause him to swallow an entire, rather colorful Colubrid snake, so that he dies of natural causes.  Tired stuff, unenlived by any of Arnold usual wisecracks, as if the writers and director were worried that humor might detract from the seriousness of the story.There's something else too.  Something at least as depressing as the movie itself.  Arnold is getting a bit old for this sort of thing.  He's terribly pumped up, it's true, but physically without much grace, unlike, say, Burt Lancaster.  It reminds me of what an anthropologist,  Alice Brues, once said about gorillas.

With this audience, it didn't seem as stupid as an Arnie flick normally is, and I found that intriguing. In many parts of the world, they take these things a whole lot more literally than do Americans. I had a similar feel watching a Stallone picture in a small town in Brazil.

In Berlin, it seems, he actually is a hero rather than a joke like our other soap opera `wrestlers.'But the funny thing was the dubbing. Arnie did not dub his own voice, though he is far more fluent in German than English. My friend explained he is in reality a bumpkin, what in the US would be a hillbilly. If he used his real voice, in his native tongue his native people would recognize him as a country dummy. This would do in the US, but not in Germany where he is taken more seriously.

When I saw Arnie drinking from a mug filled with American flags I became suspicious that this would be a patriotic American film, but am glad to say it is not. It *actually* showed the views of the Columbians, and especially with the story of how The Wolf became bad it made us actually try and see and perhaps understand the other side. I've read some very bad reviews about this movie, but all I have to say is that there were people crying at the beginning of this movie (when his family gets killed). One reviewer wrote, this film is so unrealistic and stupid that you can't help but laugh at many scenes throughout the movie that were not meant to be funny. If this one of the scenes she meant then I pity her. I highly recommend this movie.

That's sad since it's the end of an era in Hollywood action-movies. Since Stallone derailed even sooner, and van Damme is only seen in eastern-European filmed zero-budget movies, the steroid-driven action movie seemed to be more or less dead. Considering that, this movie becomes even more sad in all it's awfulness.One of my friends said that Collateral Damage is almost like a parody of Arnolds previous movies. The scary thing is that he's right. There are many outright laughable scenes here, and the whole premise of the movie is more likely to inspire laughter than interest. The action scenes are not very plentiful and not inspiring when they do happen. The scenery is sometimes awful with a few obvious studio shots mixed in with other backgrounds. And the whole premise of a huge Austrian man going under cover in South America is less than convincing...I guess in the end Collateral Damage is one of those movies where it's not as awful as many other b-movies i've seen, but the whole thing just reeks of low ambition. And above all, it's completely uninteresting. It's one of those movies that really has nothing going for it, it's not so bad as to merit a cult value, and it's not good enough to entertain you.

While his wife and daughter wait for him to collect them, they are caught up in a terrorist attack and die in the bombing. Brewer's loss turns to guilt turns to anger when he sees the Government involving themselves in political wrangling with Columbia rather than going after the evildoers. With the weight of American moral justice behind him, Brewer heads into Columbia to travel deep into the jungles, find the terrorist leader and kill him.Those who claim that this film is a tasteless attempt to cash in on 11th September 2001 forget that it was made before that terrorist attack and that it was shelved until a later date &#150; however they are right in their claims that it is tasteless. In regards 11/9/01 the film was sold on the back of American anger and demands for revenge that the film pandered to with little thought &#150; at a time of healing the marketing of this film fed the fire and in return was fuelled by it. It is impossible though not to view this film in regards the subject matter because, although not offensively simple in regards the 11/9 attacks it is still about terrorism and, for the majority of the world, terrorism has been around for a long time (in my case, my life in Northern Ireland). With any awareness of the complex issues involved, many viewers will find this impossible to stomach thanks to its simplistic view of events and the solutions it puts forward.The plot sees one man takes up weapons to deal with terrorists. Suggestions that talks and peace are the way ahead are dismissed; any discussion over why is brushed away by Brewer in his meeting with the terrorist leader and, at the end of the day, fighting terrorism is one big action movie where the good guys win and the sinister bad guys always lose. The script is so simplistic that it is hard not to feel sullied by it. As an action movie it is poor, partly because you cannot ignore the sheer offensive simplicity of the whole thing but mainly because it lacks excitement, enjoyment, thrills or entertainment value on so many levels. OK, if you want to see things go bang and non-white terrorists being beaten by American might then you may get something from it but for me it was just one big collection of action movies clichés wheeled out one after the other until I just couldn't care any more.The cast do nothing to help matters even though there are a number of well known people involved. Arnie is bland and his performance is one of such moral and ethical simplicity that it made me worry that this is how he actually sees the world &#150; I really hope it is not. Koteas is a fine actor but is totally wasted here and cannot do anything with his role. John's Leguizamo and Turturro add a bit of interest but again are just poorly used. Curtis is just a, pardon my language, clichéd coloured bad guy &#150; his character is so underdeveloped that he makes the bad guy in True Lies look like a thoughtful discussion of anti-American feeling across the world. There are a handful of other recognisable faces floating around but none of them do much so I won't waste my time.Overall, looking at this film as an action movie it is messy, uninvolving, dull, lifeless and soaked in more clichés than can be good for anyone. Sadly though, it is impossible to just view it as an action movie since it uses the response to terrorist attacks as its subject matter. With this difficult issue (and don't forget terrorist murders didn't start in September 2001) the film makes such a pathetic case that it is hard to stomach &#150; it made me watch the film right to the end but only because I really couldn't believe that anyone thought this would be a good story to tell &#150; even more so surprising that such an insensitive, jingoistic and simplistic view of the world could be presented after America itself found out what a complex issue it is. A poor movie that is only made worse by a horrid script. "}{"Title":"Something different from Schwarzenegger?

When the Colombian guerrillas take the responsibility on explosions, Arnie realises that he had spoken to the person who took the responsibility for the attack just minutes before the explosion happened. He leaves the matters in the hands of his government but when an El Lobo supporter describes the victims of the attack as Collateral Damage, Arnie(Brewer) becomes incensed. He destroys the supporters office and shouts 'I will show you collateral damage. Later in the film, he finds out that American government decides to leave everything to Colombian government to resolve. From that moment, Brewer takes matters into his own hands and starts his manhunt in Colombia. I would say that film might made Americans feel really bad as subject matter. But, it is actually not a good film altogether. We can see Arnold Schwanzeneger in a still good shape but his body is bit stiff to handle all those action!!!It is also quite ridiculous to watch an American firefighter going after an international terrorist and hunt him down single-handedly.

On the way he saves a woman and her son's life, by merely squaring up to someone.  He also bumps into a dazed John Turturro who looks like he's wandered on to the wrong film set.  All they way through you keep thinking he should have been dead about ten times by now, but maybe the Colombian rebels were just using him for their most cunning of bomb plots.

Arnie hasn´t done a really good movie since 1996´s Eraser. Jingle All The Way was simply embarassing and painful to watch. Batman & Robin was too over-the-top and filled with annoying one-liners. The movie tried so hard to be the biggest Bat movie, but it ended up dying under its own weight and literally killing the whole Batman franchise. End Of Days was decent enough, but not very memorable. The Sixth Day tried to be a hi-tech action thriller about the dangers of genetics and the result was a harmless if stupid movie that didn´t make much sense (could someone please try to make a realistic movie dealing with genetics?). The 6th Day flopped and Arnie was in trouble. Collateral Damage was obviously planned as a career saver, but then came 9/11 and everything changed. The release date was delayed and when the film was finally released critics slammed it and moviegoers didn´t care that much about it.You can enjoy Collateral Damage if you don´t expect too much from it. It´s - unfortunately - a typical Arnie movie with lots of action and... well, more action. Arnie does his best, but he isn´t exactly the greatest actor working. He´s at his best when playing guys like this, but it´s getting tiresome to see him play the same character every single time. I´m sure this movie would´ve been a direct-to-video release if it wasn´t for Arnie and director Andrew Davis. Too bad they didn´t manage to create an above-average movie.It remains to be seen if Arnie´s career continues its downhill as T3 Rise Of The Machines comes out later this year. Arnie´s obviously getting too old for an action hero and he just can´t be anything else. Arnie in a comedy? True Lies (Arnie´s best movie, in my opinion) was a successful mix of high-tech action and comedy, but how about Junior or Jingle All The Way? They were both lame, to say the least.Here´s a movie idea Arnie as a retired cop (how original) who now lives in a peaceful retirement community. Suddenly old people start disappearing and Arnie is lured back to work to find the missing elderly. Arnie discovers a massive government conspiracy and the hunter becomes hunted as well.

You can't watch a movie like this and take it too seriously, it's just entertainment, and should be considered just that. People may argue that entertainment should not(and never should)have been so realistic in the terms of violence, but come on, it's a Schwarzenegger movie, it isn't realistic!

Have you ever seen a Schwarzenegger film where Arnold dies fighting for the good cause? It's the same way with this movie.  Some may say to view a fireman as a Schwarzenegger character is making fun of them. This is COMPLETELY untrue. Why is this making fun of firemen? Because he goes out and gets the bad guy?  I'm not saying we should just forget what happened on 9/11, it's impossible. I'm also not saying we should ease off the subject by ignoring it, which is also impossible. All I'm saying is that for 2 hours we should be able to go into a movie, and enjoy it. It reminds(not makes us forget!) of a lesser time when terrorist plotted MOVIES were fun to watch(like 'Die Hard') because we all know in the end the good guy gets the bad guy, and triumphs. This will probably be the last terrorist action(not drama) movie for a LONG time. Enjoy it while you can, it won't be around like I said, for a LONG time.   P.S.

Character development leaves much to be desired as all side characters are literally cardboard cut-outs which again is an attribute copied straight from the 80s. Towards the end the plot gets really absurd with many unnecessary twists that really do not belong and could have easily been removed in editing. If you have nothing new to watch or if you want to see all Schwartznegger's movies then give Collateral Damage a shot. However, if your time is limited and you have a variety of movies to choose from then skip this and watch something else instead.

It seems to be anti-terrorist propaganda in response to the 9/11 attacks. For the purpose, the story is spun into a tale of revenge. After his family suffers collateral damage during a terrorist attack, Arnold, who is just another common firefighter, locates, goes after the terrorist abroad and kicks their asses and comes back unscratched. There no rational explanation provided for how Arnie's character is just able to to all that, so quickly too? Note that he is no great CIA agent or the like in this movie so what gives? Bad acting and some action are the only other things to expect.

I don't know how he or the production team thought they could sneak this non-sense by us by making it an action film with a little twist at the end. Not to mention that I'm sure they wanted to cash in on the terrorist craze, which after real life, I don't care to see on screen. So Gordy (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is angry that his wife and kid were killed by a terrorist's bomb, as would be anyone. But he is angry enough to cross over to Columbia to take down these terrorists and do what the U.S. government is incapable of doing, and all of this WITH HIS FIREFIGHTING TRAINING. At least Rambo was in the military.SPOILERSFirstly, the writers never develop the relationship between Gordy and his wife & kid enough for you to feel his pain. They were killed at the very beginning of the movie before you could even see him with his family at all.An audience needs to see the love between he and his family to feel his pain, because everyone knows that Arnold is not a good enough actor to portray that.Secondly, the antagonist was not built up enough for you to thoroughly hate him. I mean sure you hate anyone who places bombs in public places, but at least give us more to loathe him about besides just making him a terrorist. I think the writer believed so long as we make him an Arab or South American (who could pass for Arab) that will be enough for the audience to hate him.Thirdly, WHAT IN THE WORLD IS A FIREFIGHTER DOING GOING TO COLUMBIA TO TAKE DOWN TERRORISTS??? Even if your name is Schwarzenegger. It was just too unbelievable. He was able to cunningly go into Columbia, infiltrate a military style terrorist camp, kill some terrorists, and avoid being killed himself. Oh yeah, not to mention the fact that when he got back to America he was able to figure out that the masked terrorist on the videos was in fact the woman, AND that the boy's toy was a bomb, and lets complete the trifecta by allowing Gordy to be the one to kill the terrorist couple one of them with a fireman's ax no less.Everybody loves a hero, especially when he takes down a bad guy that is universally hated. But this time they went too far out of the realm of believability, they should have made it a fantasy movie.

Anyway, basically Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Gordy Brewer, a firefighter who recently lost his wife Anne and son Matt in a bomb explosion at the department store. He is now on a mission to track down the man responsible, he saw him on the day and he sees him again, Claudio Perrini (Cliff Curtis). On the way he meets a new friend, Selena Perrini (Francesca Neri), unfortunately she turns out to be as bad as Perrini. Also starring Elias Koteas as Peter Brandt, John Turturro as Sean Armstrong and John Leguizamo as Felix Ramirez. Filled with a bit of action, some interesting occurrences and a not bad Arnie, it's worth seeing once. Worth watching!

It's interesting how the film underlines the simplistic approach that apparently en forms the American republican thinking.It's a story of revenge. The man who lost his family at the hands of a terrorist; he is the common American, oh he saw the family die, he blames himself because he was late. This is corny and seen over and over. He strikes back, does what a great American would do, and seeks revenge. He learns a few things along the way, he learns the original killing of his family was already a revenge, and he proves himself better than the colombian terrorists by sparing the life of a mother and her child. How superior is this man? Now, to go even further **spoilers here on**, the mother whose life he spares plays double and is the central key to the terror plot which he thought was at the hands of the terrorist bad guy. Now, will you vote for Arnie? you should, now you see what's at stake. I suppose by than, Schwarzenegger would have already the politic job in mind, so i may consider this is not an innocent plot. Specially not in a film released the year next to September 11th. We have to admit this flows perfectly in butter minds.The action is worthless, see Stallone, Arnold or Seagal from the 80' to have this made better.My opinion 1/5 "},{"Title":"In a scale of 1-10 it gets a 0 .","Date":"3 February 2007","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Collateral Damage  is not only the worst movie of Arnold Schwarzenegger ,but is also one of the most boring action movies ever made .

I could say that the worst part was all that propaganda ,but this movie its so bad that I think that nobody will take seriously the message  of this movie .

The other bad point of the movie is that even when some talented actors like John Leguizamo or John Tunturro appear in this movie ,they didn't do very much , and all the screen time it's for the main actor .

I enjoy the Conan films very much (even Red Sonja!), Terminator is one of his best, T2 is very good, I love Commando and even Red Heat is good. I don't like True Lies though, but Colateral Damage is so much worse than True Lies that TL is Oscar-material in comparision!Colateral Damage is the kind of movie that should make Arnold KILL his agent! Please Arnold if your agent ever tell you to do anything like Colateral Damage again, then DON'T!Andrew Davis, who directed Colateral Damage, have, according to IMDb, directed 13 films. One of these movies is The Fugitive, which is very good. The rest are b-films or Steven Segal-movies, and I doubt I need to tell you that Segal's films are boring, totally predictable and unbelivable and plane bad. Now we all know why Andrew Davis.Colateral Damage is about a fire-man (Schwarzenegger) whos wife and son are killed in a terror-attack. He then goes to Colombia to kill the terror-leader who planted the bomb. Wow! Cool, you think, but no. It falls flat after a few seconds. Okay, the explosions are good, but very boring. The action is, well, noisy, but boring. And Arnold is... boring. EVERYTHING in this movie is BORING! ALL actors/actresses are extremely bad, not because they are bad actors, because some of them are really good in other movies (John Turrturo for instance), but probably because extremely sloppy and BAD directing. I sincerely hope that Arnold never ever works with Andrew Davis again, because that guy don't deserve Arnold!To all people who wants to see this film, my advice is DON'T! It's a waste of time, a waste of money and hopefully this film will just be forgotten under the pile of other bad films as Albert Pyun's, Nemesis 3, Tom Kennedy's Time Walker and Jan de Bont's Speed 2. And yes, Collateral Damage IS as bad as these films, but quite frankly, I would rather see NEMESIS 3 a thousand times than see Collateral Damage ever again!Rating 1 of 10 - if BOMB existed I would have blasted this movie to hell.
