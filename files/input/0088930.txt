The host later reveals they are all being blackmailed and wanted to get everybody together to confront the perpetrator, the alleged Mr. Boddy, who later is murdered by one of the guests. What follows is an exciting and intriguing series of events of finger-pointing, revealing secrets, and motives - all leading to the thrilling investigation of the entire house for clues and Butler Wadsworth's reenactment of the night's events. All the characters gave a memorable performance, each in his/her own unique flavor. The plot and story by Jonathan Lynn and John Landis, with solid direction by Lynn, are fast-paced and exciting, as this movie constantly reminds you that there is a murderer on the loose and there are obvious suspects on screen for you to decipher! In addition, I think John Morris' terrific music score enhances the mysterious feel of a murder mystery movie. The humor is great, with Miss Scarlet's acid wit being my favorite. This is also one of those movies that you will find something new every time you watch it. Some downsides, I believe, were that some of the rooms like the Conservatory, Ball Room and Billiard Rooms weren't used enough and Mr. Green's character was a little too melodramatic.

Clue is a murder mystery that takes its ideas from the popular game of Cluedo. I cant say I'm a fan of that board game (although I sometimes play it on the quiz machine in pub), but I am a fan of murder mystery - and while this film is more of a joke than anything, it generally plays it's cards right and what we have here is a very entertaining little flick, that really does deserve your time! The film shows it's experimental edge by having three endings (which can be played at random on the DVD), and throughout we are treated to a film that has it's audience in mind. Tim Curry is the big name on the cast list, and he plays butler Wadsworth. He's in charge of a house whose master has invited six guests to his home. Naturally, those guests are given the names of the people in Cluedo, and include the likes of Colonel Mustard, Mrs White and Miss Scarlet etc. We are then treated to a night of mystery, as we try to uncover who murdered the host...and why! One criticism I could easily make of this film is that it doesn't really have a lot of plot. The mystery is very shallow, and is over very quickly. This is only a shame because of the fact that I would have liked to see this go on for longer, however, as the energy that the cast brings to the table is priceless, and really makes for a good time viewing. Tim Curry takes the lead role, and does what he does best. Curry is famous for campy performances in camp films like this, and his role as Wadsworth really does his reputation proud! The film does a very good job of keeping itself wide open, and by the end it really could have been any of the characters behind the murder. This is good because it allows writer-director Jonathon Lynn complete freedom over who committed the murder; but it harms the film, as the audience doesn't really get enough info to have a stab at it themselves. The style of the film suits the mood very well, with old-fashioned clothes and decor giving it that classic mystery feel. Now don't get me wrong; this isn't exactly a great film, but it's a lot of fun and I can't see why anyone wouldn't enjoy it.

Wadsworth the butler drives up to Hill House. He checks with Yvette the maid and Mrs. Ho the cook to see if everything was in order. They were expecting company. It began to arrive one by one. First to arrive was Colonel Mustard, though not his real name, he was told to use the alias. Next was Mrs. White, followed by Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock and Miss Scarlet who arrived with Professor Plum because her car had broken down. Then they all sat down to dinner. Before long, the seventh guest, Mr. Boddy, arrived. After dinner, they went into the study where Wadsworth told some very revealing things about each of the guests. Mrs. White had two husbands. Both died mysteriously. Mrs. Peacock is a senator's wife. Professor Plum practices medicine at the U.N., or he did until his license was revoked when he was caught doing naughty business with a patient. Mr. Green works for the state department. Also, they were all being blackmailed by Mr. Boddy! Mr. Boddy brought in six presents and distributed them. Miss Scarlet got a candlestick, Mrs. White a rope, Mr. Green a lead pipe, Colonel Mustard a wrench, Professor Plum a revolver and the knife is given to Mrs. Peacock. Mr. Boddy then commanded one of them to kill Wadsworth so their secrets would be safe. the lights go out. The gun goes off, but it isn't Wadsworth that get's it.       Before long, they find the cook murdered as well and when carrying her back to the study, Mr. Boddy's body had disappeared! They found it later stuffed in the lavatory. Who did this? And where? And with what? Wadsworth locked up the weapons just as a motorist showed up. He had car trouble and wished to use the phone. He went into the lounge. Colonel Mustard suggested they split up and search the house to see if there was anyone else in the house. So the split up and the motorist is soon murdered. Wrench hit him on the head. Then a cop shows up. He uses the phone in the library. Suddenly, the murderer switches off the power, grabs the rope and strangles Yvette. Then they kill the cop with the lead pipe and when a singing telegram girl comes to the door, she's sadly shot. Wadsworth turns the power back on and they discover the dead bodies. Wadsworth then ran through all the events of the evening to unveil who the murderer is. So after going through each and every event, the killer turns out to be Miss Scarlet! Actually, there were three endings to our story. The first names Miss Scarlet as the killer. The second names Mrs. Peacock. The third names everybody but Mr. Green.        A pretty good movie. I'm a fan of the board game as well. There's an all-star cast here. Eileen Brennan is Mrs. Peacock, Tim Curry is Wadsworth, Madeline Kahn is Mrs. White, Christopher Lloyd is Professor Plum (the Prof. Plum on the front of the 1960s' Clue game looks just like Christopher Lloyd!), Michael McKean is Mr. Green, Martin Mull is Colonel Mustard, Leslie Ann Warren is Miss Scarlet. Colleen Camp is Yvette and Lee Ving is Mr. Boddy. Madeline Kahn is sadly no longer with us. She will be missed.

With the costumes, the actors and a gem of a script, what could possibly go wrong? The script was hilarious. Every line was enough to make you fall off the chair. The Kingdom of Heaven bit was sidesplittingly funny, because it was just so random. True, it is nothing like the Board Game, but the way they revolve it around the Board Game, was so clever. Some of it was extremely silly, but have a heart, it's a comedy, it's supposed to be. The casting was just ingenious. Eileen Brennan was just flawless, giving Mrs Peacock a much needed bit of edge. Tim Cury stole every scene he was in, and he looked , as always, as though he was having the time of his life. Madeline Kahn was just hilarious, especially with her line Husbands should be like Kleenex, soft, strong and disposable and the iconic Life before death is as improbable as sex after marriage. Christopher Lloyd seemed restrained, but his dry humour made Professor Plum an unforgettable character. Michael McKean was a bit whiny, but I don't care, it's called acting, plus Mr Green is supposed to be timid. Martin Mull has great comedic timing, and brought a bit a stupidity to his role of Colonel Mustard. My favourite characterisation was that of Miss Scarlet, played by Lesley Ann Warren, looking gorgeous in that emerald green dress. (Miss Scarlet was the closest characterisation to the board Game). Colleen Camp looked lovely and I liked the jokes about her boobs, and Lee Ving (part of a joke, Leaving soon) was very good too. The three endings were so funny, very silly, but it is like the Pink panther franchise, it is all about the comedy. You would've never guessed the final solution in a million years, because the third ending had me completely by surprise, and I am not kidding. This movie is a must-see for all Tim Curry fans, like me. If you want to see more of this talented man, check out Legend, Rocky Horror(obviously) and Stephen King's It(his career-best)10/10.

And since it originated as a stage play, the important elements in Clue are acting, dialogue, and costumes. Eileen Brennan is terrific as Mrs. Peacock, with that tacky hairpiece and those bizarre glasses. Madeline Kahn as Mrs. White, and Tim Curry as Wadsworth the butler, are also good.Most of the predictably heavy dialogue is not especially funny, but some of it is, as this exchange between Col. Mustard (Martin Mull) and Wadsworth. Col. Mustard Wadsworth, am I right in thinking there is nobody else in this house? Wadsworth No. Col. Mustard Then there is someone else in this house. Wadsworth No, I'm sorry I said no meaning yes. Col. Mustard No, meaning yes? Look, I want a straight answer; is there someone else or isn't there, yes or no? Wadsworth No. Col. Mustard No there is, or no there isn't. Wadsworth Yes.The film's plot, especially in the second half, consists of lots of rushing back and forth between rooms, as Wadsworth explains the laughably complicated murder plot. And with three alternate endings, the film makes the point, perhaps unintentionally, that the solutions to whodunit puzzles are largely arbitrary. The two songs Shake, Rattle And Roll and Life Could Be A Dream, along with those antique autos the suspects drive are the main clues to the film's setting in the early 1950s.Although the film is not nearly as good as Murder By Death (1976), a similar spoof, Clue is still an enjoyable film, especially for the fine performances of Eileen Brennan, Madeline Kahn, and Tim Curry.

I rented it almost immediately. My, was it awesome! It's just the perfect murder mystery. Something everyone should see.It all takes place one wild and stormy night in 1954, somewhere in New England, most likely Massachusetts or Connecticuit. After all the guests have arrived and had dinner (soup and, brace yourself, MONKEY'S BRAINS!), Wadsworth, the butler, reveals that one of them, a certain Mr. Boddy has been blackmailing them for quite sometime now. Knowing they plan to turn him in any time, Mr. Boddy gives them each a present- a lethal weapon, thinking he can use them to expose all his fellow guests. Big mistake! This leads to murder! But who did it? As if this weren't troubling enough, the guests soon find themselves in the company of Mr. Boddy's accomplices. Needless to say, things get really crazy from there.Comedy director Jonathan Lynn must have worked really hard on this one. Apparently he's one of those directors who sometimes succeeds and sometimes doesn't quite make it. The only other movie of his I've seen so far is Greedy, which isn't even close to Clue in terms of excellence.The casting is great all around. Tim Curry has never been better. There's just nothing he won't do for the big screen, is there? In his role as Wadsworth, he conveys the perfect emotion and personality. It's a joy to watch him running around the house and shouting his head off in trying to explain the whole thing. It makes it all the more hard to believe that he spent the first few minutes of the movie in complete silence. Lesley Ann Warren is delightful as the sly Miss Scarlet. She seems like quite a seductress, despite the fact that she holds off any inappropriate contact with the men. I especially love the slick tone she takes in saying, I did what I'm being blackmailed for. Madeline Kahn, my all-time favorite comedy actress, plays Mrs. White (a guest this time around, rather than the maid). In a much straighter performance than usual, she is hysterical nonetheless, only in a rather dramatic sort of way, which makes her all the more special to watch. I'll never forget the day she died if I live to be 150. Christopher Lloyd plays Professor Plum. Like Kahn, he too shys away from his usual type of comedy. He plays his role with a perfectly normal expression and tone throughout the movie, and thus is even better than one may expect. Who could have played Colonel Mustard better than Martin Mull? He looks rather like the Colonel and has the same first name (according to the books) and the same first two letters of his last name. To top it all, he plays his part marvelously, complete with a top-notch scare over the chandelier nearly falling on him. Michael McKean is an ideal Mr. Green. Oh, his constant screams of I didn't do it! And of course he saves the day (er, night) at the end. Mrs. Peacock is played to perfection by Eileen Brennan. I didn't blame the other guests for their cooperating nervously when she pulled out that the revolver. She sure gave off a frightening impression there. And don't you just love those peacock feathers in her hair? Lee Ving is the perfect Mr. Boddy. A better choice for a blackmailer you'll never find. Colleen Camp is delightful (and cute) as Yvette, the french maid, who's not quite as innocent as she may seem at first glance. The cast also includes jazz singer Bill Henderson, Jeffrey Kramer, and Howard Hesseman in a brief unbilled appearance.The movie as a whole is a complete gem. It's hilarious in a scary sort of way, just the way it was meant to be. It has the honor the first movie I ever purchased (we were never the type of family to buy movies- but my parents know they can no longer control how I spend my own money!)

The acting is superb- as each and every actor delivers a pitch-perfect and well-crafted performance. Without the above, Clue would have become another forgotten comedy. As it turns out, Clue is now more popular today than it was upon release. The only explanation I can think of that it was not more successful is that Hollywood does not tend to back movies that do not have HUGE stars in them as fiercely as they do the summer blockbusters and star-couplings (which does not actually make full sense). Eileen Brennan's 'Mrs. Peacock' is flawless, as is Madeline Kahn's 'Ms. White,' Tim Curry's 'Wadsworth' and Michael McKean's 'Mr. Green.' If Hollywood made more movies with ensembles as competent across the board as this ( a la Eastwood with Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby), cinema would be a lot more satisfying.

So when I was a kid, I jumped at the chance to see the movie, although I never really appreciated it much till I was a bit older.Clue is based on the background story to the board game. The evasive Mr. Body (Lee Ving) invites six guests to his mansion for dinner and blackmail. His six guests, Mr. Green (Michael McKeon), Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Col. Mustard (Martin Mull), and Mrs. Scarlet (Leslie Ann Warren) all have something in common, although they don't initially know this, some dark secret in their background that they'd rather not have out in the open. But if Mr. Body doesn't expose them, they'll have to spill the beans anyways in order to clear themselves. Although, this is really inconsequential to the story in the end, anyway. That is, when Mr. Body suddenly drops dead before his guests, followed by the cook and the butler. Before anymore wind up dead, and in order to catch the culprit and solve the whodunnit, the six guests lock themselves inside the mansion to figure out who killed them, in what room, and with what weapon. Hence, the connection to the board game.You have a great comedic cast, even if there is not much of a story and the entire film is focused on the characters really doing nothing more than running all around the creepy mansion, engaging in a few amusing miscalculations. I suppose because they weren't sure how to end such a simple story (and given all of the possibilities you're offered in the game), they have this is a movie with three different endings, each starting with...if it happened that way. But, this comedy is particularly saved by a tremendous cast, especially Madeline Kahn (I love the flames routine she does) as the scheming Mrs. White.The story is quite similar to the 1945 mystery drama, ...And Then There Were None, based on the Agatha Christie novel. If you like Clue, I would highly recommend this older version of the novel adaptation (I have not yet seen any of the remakes). There, ten guests are invited to an isolated mansion and, one by one, each is killed off according to the old poem, Ten Little Indians. A much funnier version of this latter film, and one closer to Clue (but still funnier yet) is the Neil Simon comedy, Murder By Death, which involves a highly eccentric mansion resident who invites famous private detectives to his mansion for a game. He informs them that each will be killed off and the person who figures out who the culprit is wins the game. So if you like Clue, you might enjoy those two movies, too.

Based on the popular board game of the same name, Clue has a bright ensemble cast.

Curry also comes off well as the butler, Wadsworth, as does Martin Mull as the dumb-as-he-looks Colonel Mustard. The three endings is a bit much, but all three are good fun.

It results to be an entertaining and bemusing spoof of Agatha Christie novels , though it is in fact a pale imitation of the earlier , much better and more satisfying sleuthing spoof ¬®Murder by death¬® by Robert Moore with Alec Guinness , Truman Capote , Elsa Lanchester , David Niven , Nancy Walker , James Cromwell and Eileen Brennan too ; as this movie was followed by hammy spoof ¬®Clue¬®(1985) an inferior but enjoyable imitation of the previous parody . It is an entertaining and fun comedy of murders in which the laughs pile up before your eyes , director has got success in keeping the bizarre and grotesque appearances of the actors in hyperactive movement , shouting and frantic running around , principally from Tim Curry . Despite the ridiculous and unnecessary camera movements , Jonathan Lynn manages to maintain a coherent and compelling plot plenty of twists and turns . The screenplay is funny and high quality in which it's not difficult to work out on which murder-solvers each of them is modeled ; furthermore , stand up Tim Curry as a botcher as well as hyperactive butler and a suitably eccentric Lesley Ann Warren , of course , Christopher Lloyd is appealing too . The entire cast seems to be subsisting on sugar with wild eyes and frenetic movements the order of the day . You'll enjoy enormously the impersonations of the strange characters . The film was one of a number of pictures, mostly comedies, made and released between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, that revived the old dark house mansion movie . Three endings were shot, and a different one shown at each theater . All three are included on video . The DVD, however, aside from all three endings, also offers the option to play the movie with one randomly selected ending. In some cities, the newspaper print ads indicated which version was being shown at each theater . Lively and fun musical score by John Morris . Evocative and colorful cinematography by Victor J. Kemper . This whodunit mystery picture was uneven but professionally directed by Jonathan Lynn . Lynn is an expert on comedies as he has demonstrated in My cousin Vinny , The Distinguished Gentleman , Greedy , Nuns on the run , The Whole Nine Yards , among others . Lynn has also enjoyed notable success on the British stage and television with series as Yes Prime Minister , My Brother's Keeper , Doctor on the go , and Doctor at sea . Though the picture's performance at the box-office was disappointing, the film ¬®Clue¬® has since developed a cult following .

There is a lot of witty word-games and puns so that the dialog is extremely memorable. There is also classic slapstick-humor also. The mood in the film is thrilling. You can easily enjoy comedic murder-solving and the movie can be watched many times. If you like the game Clue you have to see Clue the movie The cast consist of some funny comedians like Michael Mckean, Christopher Lloyd, the late Madeline Kahn, etc. Tim Curry is energetic as Wadsworth.In the end the movie thrills with alternative ending- sequence This is how it could have happened or This is what really happened.

Based off of the famous board game, Clue is a fantastic movie for people of all ages. I, myself, was drawn to this movie at the age of seven or eight, and it has faithfully been my favorite movie ever since!The movie starts with six guests (Mr. Green, Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum, Miss. Scarlet, Mrs. White, and Mrs. Peacock) all being invited to a large mansion in New England for a dinner party, of which they know absolutely nothing about. At the party they all find out that they have more in common than they first realized, and the murders begin, starting with Mr. Boddy, the seventh guest! And as the night goes on, suspicion lands on each of the guests, as well as the butler Wadsworth. So not only is the movie uproarious, but it's actually a very intriguing mystery!The acting is absolutely spot on in Clue! Eileen Brennan plays Mrs. Peacock, a talkative politician's wife. Madeline Kahn is Mrs. White, my favorite character in the movie! Mrs. White is a widow who may have more to do with her husband's death than she's letting on! Christopher Lloyd does a terrific job as Professor Plum, the ladies man wannabe! Michael McKean plays the hopelessly clumsy Mr. Green. Martin Mull is Colonel Mustard, the man who tries to act as if he knows exactly what is going on. Lesley Ann Warren is awesome as Miss. Scarlet the temptress, and of course you can not forget the amazing Tim Curry who plays cool and composed Wadsworth, the butler.As I said before, this is a movie for people of all ages. In fact, just recently I got my six-year-old brother to watch it, and he too claims it is his favorite movie! Does he understand every single joke? No, of course not! But the upbeat, fast pace of the movie has him watching it over and over, and acting out the famous Wadsworth Explains Everything scene! I fully recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good laugh and tons of fun!

And that's where the similarities end for unlike the other tie-in duds this film is a very enjoyable and original film.The entertainment value of this film is remarkably high. Not only are we given an exciting whodunnit mystery but also an enjoyable comedy featuring many witty one liners and subtle in-jokes with a sprinkling of slapstick on top. One of the reviewers here the oddly named Abba owns me complains that the characters in this film are underdeveloped and are as wooden as their corresponding Player pieces that come with the Cluedo boardgame. But what Abba owns me fails to understand is that most murder mysteries normally do not delve too deeply into any character study of the suspect characters. Which leaves the viewer to focus on the solving the crime by noting the actions and responses of these suspect characters to the events happening around them.  The fact that this film also emulates this trend is more of a strength than a weakness in that it is just as focused on it's murder/ mystery theme as well as it's comedic theme.Besides this the performances of the entire cast in this film are first rate especially  Tim Curry who steals this film with his over the top performance of Wadsworth the butler (which I feel was his best one to date!!). It is not too hard to notice that the entire cast must have had a whale of a time making this film from watching their passionate and over the top performances. And kudos to the script writers for concluding the film with 3 different endings which was a very original concept that has never been imitated by any other film since then. All three endings that were released to cinemas separately are included in the VHS version, my favourite being the 2nd ending. Clue also features an excellent soundtrack which denotes the fifties setting in which this film and boardgame  is based (I particularily like the energetic piece of classic music that is played throughout the film).Clue is a wonderful film whose entry  excels in each of it's genres such as comedy, murder/ mystery and of course the movie based on a game genre. Although the biggest mystery of this film is to why it has not transcended from VHS to DVD format as of yet!!!! I rate Clue 10/10!!!!

During the evening, secrets are revealed, people are murdered, lights go on and off and the lines come thick and fast  well it's a matter of life after death. Now that he's dead i have a life. The cast are clearly having a complete riot with Tim Curry, Eileen Brennan and the late, great Madeline Kahn coming off with particular sparks. The look of the film is wonderful. Set in 1954, the attention to detail in the set design and costumes are spot-on. The lighting and feel is not too dis-similar to the 1976 murder-spoof Murder by Death, incidentally also starring Eileen Brennan. Despite being a minor hit on it's initial theatrical release Clue has since become something of a cult hit, and for good reason, as its great fun and whilst certain plot-holes may have you scratching your head, it's best that you leave your brain at the door and enjoy it for what it is. Great fun. The home-DVD/video version comes with all three endings. A fourth was filmed but edited out of the final film. Stills from it can be found in a hard to find book  Clue The Storybook.

When the man is confronted by evidence from the butler, he turns out the lights hoping that the people will kill the butler and carry on business as usual. But when the lights are turned back on, the man is dead. The group (including the butler) go to the kitchen and discover that the cook is dead also. They return to the study where they then discover the dead man is not actually dead at all - he's got up and moved. One of the women goes to the bathroom and finds the undead man in the bathroom - dead! So who was it? Was it Wadsworth (the butler), Mrs Peacock, Miss Scarlet, Mrs White, Col. Mustard, Prof. Plum or Mr Green? In a similar way to 'Murder By Death' the film thrives on comedy and confusion and, although you may find it confusing at times, everything makes sense when compiled at the end as it leads towards (on the DVD) one of three surprise endings. 'Clue' is funny from start to finish with some gags I can honestly say I didn't see coming. But this film would not have been as good were it not for the 3 C's comedy, confusion and Curry.Tim Curry was excellent in his role as Wadsworth the butler, stealing the show from all of the others with charisma which is present in all of his roles. The other actors were brilliant as well, just adding to the quality of an already great film. I preferred this to the aforementioned 'Murder By Death' and I think the reason was the comedy - I found 'Clue' more amusing than 'Murder By Death' though both are really good films.I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, definitely worth the money. And to those who think this films rubbish - Frankly Scarlet, I don't give a damn - Wadsworth!! Cat ¬ßquire PS. If you liked this then check out 'Murder By Death' or vice versa!

SPOILERS AHEAD. In one ending Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren) does the majority of the killing. That makes sense. In another Mrs Peacock does most of them in This however does not make sense. When she is apparently killing people on the first floor the film clearly shows her smaking the furnace in the dark. As is the last ending. In this ending each of the suspects kills someone. The problem here is again when the lights go out and Yvette, The Cop, & the singing telegram girl are all murdered then, or so we are told in the ending. Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn with some great lines I might add) is supposedly the one who kills Yvette. Yet during the film we see her upstairs screaming her head off and backing up to a window. So my question is that how could people be in 2 places at one time? Still even though with the faults I have just mentioned I still LOVE this film.

The end is a little hard to follow (Mr Boddy was really the butler, Wadsworth was really Mr. Boddy) and it is annoying watching Wadsworth retell the events in a fast-forwarded version with all three endings. The acting and casting of parts is exceptional. It is a fun movie that most people will enjoy. Having three unique endings distinguishes this movie from all others.

A box office flop at the time it was released, the years have been kind and now it's generally thought of as one of the better comedies to come out of the '80s. The story moves at a breakneck pace and the script is full of memorable lines and old school screwball comedy. John Landis co-wrote the screenplay and you can definitely see his type of humor throughout. The cast is superb. Martin Mull, Christopher Lloyd, Eileen Brennan, Madeline Kahn, Michael McKean, and Lesley Ann Warren all bring their A game here. But the standouts are Tim Curry's manic performance as the butler and Colleen Camp's scenery-chewing bosom. Oh, come on, you know you couldn't take your eyes off of her! Warren was nothing to sneeze at, either. Lasciviousness aside, Camp in her supporting role holds her own against the bigger names in the cast. The costumes and sets are beautiful. I really liked how all the little things from the game were cleverly worked into the film. John Morris' score is exciting and fun. I love the three endings and the film's hysterical final line.

Clue is my favourite board game and I think everyone is familiar with it. Players have to solve the murder of Mr Boddy including who killed him and where and with what (this is also a line of dialogue in the film). In order to sustain a movie the writer/director Jonathan Lynn added several other murders and 3 different endings. The dialogue is very fast paced and incredibly witty. I would suggest watching the movie more than once just to catch all the lines. The acting is excellent all around. Tim Curry is amazing as Wadsworth (the butler); other favourites are Eileen Brennan as Mrs Peacock and the hilarious Madeline Kahn as Mrs White.

Yeah, I know. I have a lot of favorite movies. What can I say, I love movies.This movie I like because it is a mystery and a comedy rolled into one. The cast that was assembled made this movie what it was. Tim Curry is great as Wadsworth, the Butler. Martin Mull is awesome as Colonel Mustard. Lesley Ann Warren is pretty darn good as Miss Scarlet, and beautiful too. So is Colleen Camp as Yvette. Christopher Lloyd is great as Professor Plum and Michael McKean is a convincing bumbling Mr. Green. I could go on, but I won't.Again as has become my custom I have several favorite scenes, which I will list.My first favorite scene is the three endings. The three endings are a series of endings in which the many different murders are explained. Wadsworth begins to explain how the cook, the motorist, Yvette, Mr. Boddy, the cop, and the singing telegram girl. All three endings are slightly different giving the viewer a murder mystery feel as they try to figure out who-done-it.The next like of mine really isn't about any one scene in particular. I like the awkwardness of each character interacting with the others. The script calls for several of the character, Wadsworth in particular, to utilize double talk, or using words that have double meaning. Some of it is confusing and the viewer almost gets lost in the conversation, but in a weird way it's funny.The last part of Clue that I like is the sexual innuendo, and the not so subtle sexual tension, aspect of the script. Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum and Mr. Boddy all hit on either Miss Scarlet or Yvette. Mr. Boddy attempts to feel up Yvette while at dinner, but she steps away before he can get too far. Professor Plum did feel up Miss Scarlet by moving his hand to her rear-end while waiting for the front door to open.I give this 8 Stars out of 10, only because it is out of date. Yes, I know that it is period movie, set in the early 1950's. However, we are talking about a movie that hit the theaters nearly 30 years ago.

If you never understand that you'll never enjoy this film. That might be why they chose Tim Curry to anchor this whole thing. I couldn't imagine anyone else to do it. There are few actors as versatile, as great or as underused as Curry. I mean think about it. What do you most remember him for? As a crazed transvestite in Rocky Horror. As Long John Silver in Muppet Treasure Island and this and he's pure gold in this. Camp, hammy, energetic, mercurial and fun. He is what holds everything together and the rest of the talented cast work around him. Even Christopher Lloyd turns in a subdued performance and allows Curry to run around and sweat and break the fourth wall and do that fabulous cocked eyebrow thing he does. Thats not to say the rest of the ensemble do nothing. Everyone gets some good one liners and everyone contributes. Michael Mckean is especially good as the clumsy Mr Green and Madeline Kahn has never turned in a bad performance.The real trick with this film is you just have to go with it. Its based on a board game, the plot is tissue paper thin. Its barely there,the continuity is all over as well but the energy is faultless and you'll have a few chuckles which sometimes is good enough.Of course you can pick fault with this all day long if you want to.

With everyone from Michael McKean to Martin Mull to Madeline Kahn, the cast is simply perfect although I gotta admit that both Tim Curry and Bill Henderson really stand-out as the fastidious butler and a cop who looks like he was trained by Elmer Fudd.The set design is really appropriate for the genre with a spooky Victorian house set against a dark and stormy night. The time period also adds to the sense of foreboding and mystery (the movie is set in 1954). It's also fascinating to note the movie holds our attention within this set because the whole movie takes place at this castle-like home.Bottom-line?

Everybody was probably amused and they seem to have a rather good time, except maybe Colleen Camp who was typecast through most of the 80's as the character she plays here.Jonathan Lynn, the director, would go on to better things like My cousin Vinny but this is an impressive early effort from a TV-writer (he was one of the creators of Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister).

While the script has some hilarious lines (Life after death is as improbable as sex after marriage) the core of the film is in the casting. Eileen Brennan is excellent as the disapproving, addle-brained Mrs Peacock, Christopher Lloyd inspiredly cast as the sex-mad Professor Plum, Madeleine Kahn is gorgeously mysterious Mrs White and Colleen Camp is pure delight as the sexy maid Yvette whom all the male guests leer after.

The movie puts to use the all star cast, using their skills to paint a tableau of characters deeply disturbed, yet perfectly matched to teach a message subtly, steering away from didactic ism. In its effective combination of satire, social issues of the time, nutty characters and an outrageous setting, a brilliant message shines through.

The six guests might be strangers to one another in person but they are related by their actions, they all in one way or another have sinned and for those sins they are held captive by their host who is trying to bring them to justice. These six guests along with the house's Butler and Vet have to work together to find the murderer before he takes another life or worse, one of their lives. ( It is similar in many ways to Agatha Christine's  And Then There Were None) This extremely sinister plot is shown with adequate satire to cover up the gruesomeness which is usually seen in Murder mysteries. Each character has his/her very own history and what makes them the perfect crowd are their habits and mindsets which make up perfectly for the other characters, the characters involve a Colonel and Psychiatrist who are driven by lust, an extremely seductive french maid who shows no interest in the men mentioned earlier, a prostitution wing operator, a femme fatal and a homosexual in whom the maid shows interest. These singular yet complementing characters work through the ridiculous murder scandal with a comedic side.What makes the Clue a good  comedic murder mystery is its third act in which we see not one but three explanations for the events which occurred on a rainy night in a wretched house.

Madeline Kahn always reminded me of Imelda Staunton with her perfectly- timed facial expressions; and Michael McKean is excellent as usual. This film is more manic than the similar - but more sophisticated - Murder By Death (1976), and from my wife's reaction when watching it, I'm sure a lot of my fondness of it comes from enjoying it as a child... but I still say if you can stand the rather hysterical performances you'll be in for a treat - lots of great one-liners and memorable moments (Jane Wiedlin with the briefest of cameos as a singing telegram in particular).

Battleship certainly wasn't amazing. Cluedo is a very fun and clever board game. Yet this film, based on the board game, is 10 times more fun. Clue has various guests at a house trying to solve a series of murders, all of them played by fun actors in full on hilarious camp mode. This has 3 endings which are shown back to back on the Netflix version. Clue is simply one of the most fun comedies you'll ever watch. It's not for everyone as the camp tone and lack of seriousness may start to get on people's nerves after a while. Also, I think one ending was enough. In terms of quality it's an 8, but in terms of enjoyment it's pretty much a 10. The script is so energetic you can almost see the sparks fly and it crackles with energy, delivering hilarious joke after hilarious joke like a ballistic missile launcher, while the direction is also well done. Although the 3 solutions do pile up, all of them make sense and the mystery is rather difficult to solve.All of the actors, especially Tim Curry, are great and the sets are fun as well, creating a campy sense of Gothic. Thankfully, it doesn't stick entirely to the formula of the board game and allows itself to be its own movie. Because of the endlessly silly tone it is at the expense of actual tension, but this adds to the movie a little at the same time. It's an acquired taste and if you want to see anyone take anything seriously look else where but this is without a doubt the most under appreciated comedy of all time. It gets a lot of bad reviews, but it's incredibly funny, it has loads of entertaining set pieces and the cast are awesome. Thankfully viewers have been less harsh on the film and it is a cult classic but it deserves to be more than that. Clue was a hugely pleasant surprise as I wasn't expecting much yet I was in full on maniacal laughter mode for the whole film.

The whole basis of the plot is a political, social, and convoluted network of double-crossings and connections. The six guests from the board game are all a part of the other's predicament of blackmail by Mr. Boddy, even though none of them have met each other until they all arrive at the mansion. But you don't need to keep track of all of the background blackmailing information to enjoy it because it's a comedy, not a drama or spy movie where you're trying to predict the ending the whole way through. The guests are primarily connected by other characters, some that are not in the film, and some that are servants of the mansion (Yvette has a prior connection to about three of the guests). I would say that it's better just to let the characters develop in your mind during their brief revelations of why they are blackmailed instead of trying to remember all of it. Besides, Wadsworth the butler, played by Tim Curry, runs through the entire night in five minutes at the end and makes it all clear-ish to the audience. In some ways, Wadsworth is the main character because he sort of runs the show and knows what's going on. He is rather proper and butlery, but has a distinct personality. The other six guests have equal parts to Wadsworth, but are set apart from him because they are all rather in the dark on several points and are all suspected of murdering Mr. Boddy. They all have well developed personalities and individualized styles of humor. Mrs. White is cold and very defensive in a way that kind of says I'm guilty but you can't really prove it. She makes a number of snide remarks about people, particularly towards Yvette and her late husbands, but she doesn't always deliver them in ways that automatically tell you that it's supposed to be funny. This is true of many of the funny lines of this movie, though certainly not all. There are several quick remarks that don't seem like they will produce any kind of humor, but when you take it together and figure out what they mean, you find the funny side of it. Mr. Green is an incredibly clumsy and nervous man who seems to make a fool of himself in some way whatever he is doing, and the humor he creates is a bit more blatant. Mrs. Peacock is a rather shrill older lady that looks like she jumped in a pile of leaves before coming to the dinner. She tries to create the impression that she is innocent by being excessively flaky and flustered. Professor Plum is rather excitable and wide-eyed throughout and pleads innocence by acting rather frightened the whole time. Miss Scarlet is the one that seems most guilty because she creates the impression that she is proud of what she is being blackmailed for and almost looks for approval from the others. Lastly, Colonel Mustard is the accusatory one of the bunch, trying to point the blame away from himself and often embarrassing himself as he does. Each guest murders one person, and these six victims play small parts, some smaller than others depending on how quickly they get killed off. The two most developed of these, apart from Wadsworth, are Yvette and the cop. Yvette assists in the investigation of the murders and is very scared of both the guests that she is associated with and the situation they are caught in. She adds to the slight air of suspense that floats through the proceedings. The cop makes the whole group nervous with his suspicion, and sort of embodies the audience's feelings with his confused reactions to the guests' antics. All of the character are well cast and well played by their actors. The three endings are kind of fun, and they collectively embody the three ways one would expect the film to end. The first one has the crook that you don't expect (Mrs. Peacock) as the murderer. The second has the one you would expect (Miss Scarlet). The third and real ending has the impartial one where everyone did it and Wadsworth is the truly guilty one. I found the whole thing to be fairly interesting and very funny throughout. Whether you like this movie or not really depends on whether you like the jokes and how much you care about how the blackmail plot plays into it. There isn't much to criticize with the execution, though I guess you could poke holes in the way that the victims are incorporated. Regardless of whether you enjoy it or not, it is well done, and there aren't many examples supporting the theory that it isn't. So I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy. For me, it's hard to say what other movies it is similar to, so I don't know what kind of cinematic tastes it appeals to, though it has a lot of memorable quotes if you like that. I rather think they could make a reboot of this with Benedict Cumberpatch as Wadsworth, Anne Hathaway as Miss Scarlet, Jim Carrey as Professor Plum, Uma Thurman as Mrs. White, Bruce Willis as Colonel Mustard, Will Ferrel as Mr. Green, Una Stubbs as Mrs. Peacock, Luke Evans as Mr. Boddy, and Emma Stone as Yvette. But, somehow, I feel like it might not have the same elements that people like about the original. Overall Rating 8.6/10.

The IMDb rating is very accurate, though, as this movie is actually above average, if not quite an all-time classic even of its genre of comedy whodunits.The movie is of course based on the board game Clue (Cluedo in non-US markets). The very prospect of being a board game adaptation likely contributes to few people took this movie very seriously, but once you get over the silliness of that it is actually a decent adaptation. The basics of the game - the absurd character names and the basic concept of trying to figure out which character killed who, where, and with what deadly weapon is translated to film more accurately than I would have ever imagined possible without just filming people playing the actual game.The familiar characters, Colonial Mustard et al., are given goof-ball back-stories appropriate to the 1950s setting, the era when the board game first became popular, giving the movie a nostalgic feel that works well enough. They are all drawn to the signature mansion (an excellent matte art job) and learn from the Butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry in a great performance) that they are there to meet their mutual blackmailer, Mr. Boddy.As you would expect from his name and the basic premise of the movie, the murders start shortly after Mr. Boddy arrives. The movie is then a zany group investigation of who killed Mr. Boddy and the other supporting characters, who all are quickly knocked off by an unseen killer or killers. Much of the charm of the entire movie comes from Curry's amazing performance as he dashes around the house with all of the other characters in tow, energetically trying to determine who is behind all the murders (or perhaps draw attention away from himself?) This is definitely a high-energy whodunit, but unlike in _Sleuth_, a classic of the genre, it is run like a sprint with no interruptions. _Sleuth_ alternated between fast and slow sections, and I think the pacing contributed to its success. It's hard to imagine how _Clue_ could slow down, though, as the audience would have to think about how insane and unbelievable the characters and the overall plot are._Clue_ relies a lot on cheap gags and occasionally even on crude humor, which is amusing at times but sometimes falls flat. Its tendency toward groaner jokes is a real weakness, but there are some genuinely funny parts of the movie. The plot is, as I mentioned, completely unbelievable, but I think it's fun enough that you don't have to get too concerned with its lack of realism.In the end, the strong performances and the enjoyable, if silly, overall vibe of the movie make this one worth watching. It deserves a better reputation than it currently has!

It wasn't intentional, it wasn't because of personal grudges; the opportunity simply never presented itself any sooner! Well, that's certainly something I regret now, damned! If I had discovered this film ten years ago, for example, it would have been a personal favorite ten years ago already and I would undoubtedly have re-watched it numerous times and introduced it to many friends by now. Oh well, it's never too late for that. Clue is fantastic entertainment, with an ultimately ingenious basic premise (the first film ever to be based on a board game), copious amounts of hilarious dialogs & one-liners, stellar performances from ideally cast actors and actresses and a uniquely structured narrative with no less than three different endings. Who doesn't know the game of Cluedo (Clue in America)? In case you grew up in an era where portable video games and similar rubbish hadn't been invented yet, chances are high that you played this game at one point during your childhood and/or adolescence. I know for a fact that it saved me from numerous otherwise boring afternoons with distant relatives and the offspring of my parents' friends. The set-up of the game is utterly simple who committed the murder, in what room of the house and by using which murder weapon? There are multiple potential murderers, each hiding behind a suspicious facade and a color pseudonym, a large house full of rooms and secret passageways and a wide variety of murderers. Naturally there has to be a bit more background and introduction in a long-feature movie, but writers Jonathan Lynn (in his debut) and all-around genius John Landis (American Werewolf in London) came up with a pretty tight and clever wraparound story. Six mystery guests, all living and/or working in Washington D.C, are lured to the secluded Hill House for a night of humiliating revelations and unexpected confrontations. They're all being blackmailed by one and the same person, but when that person is lying dead on the library floor after a moment of lights-out, they suddenly all become murder suspects. Together with the peculiar house personnel, like the hyperactive butler Wadsworth and the voluptuous French maid Yvette, they try to unmask the culprit (but mostly clear their own names) before the police arrives. Instead of finding the killer, more bodies start to pile up Clue is a genuinely hilarious comedy AND a truly compelling murder- mystery at the same time. How seldom do run into one of those? The film is funny without having to revert to vulgarity or black humor. The script is funny in an old-fashioned way, through cunning one-liners and subtle little details in the set-pieces. The film is also dazzlingly fast-paced and literally chock-full of obvious tributes to classic horror films (like House on Haunted Hill), classic whodunit (Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians) and classic fellow parodies (Murder by Death). All cast members give away tremendous performances and it's simply impossible to pick out any favorites. Tim Curry is sublime as the eloquent butler, Madeline Kahn is stupendous as the frigid widow, etc, etc. This is definitely a brand new personal favorite of mine, and I hope to recommend it to many more fans of original and creative cult cinema.

If you are bored...scratch that statement. Watch Clue.

The only other movie in this vein that I know of, is Neil Simon's Murder By Death, which pokes fun at the several detective archetypes. This movie goes a bit further by offering the viewer three different endings.The filmmakers have gathered a fine cast of actors of the type that usually get secondary roles but here have the opportunity to shine Christopher Lloyd, Tim Curry, Michael McKean, and several others.The movie is sometimes repetitive, it takes a while to get on with the premise, but that's not a big problem since the movie is quite short, and although the movie has great gags, some fall short. The viewer should not come to this movie expecting a great cinematic experience, but it's a fine way to spend an hour and a half.

Being a comedy it takes it's pages from slapstick 101, and delivers a high energy film by way of an ensemble comic cast.The plot and story aren't what one might expect from a flick based on a game, and the laughs rate more as smiles than actual guffaws. It's a moderate film that would appear to have baffled the writers. How does one invent a story around a board game? Nevertheless the creative team on clue puzzled something out that was rather inventive and moderately entertaining. The version provided on the DVD is the version I saw on HBO many years back. For those not in the know there were three different endings shot, giving the ticket buying audience a reason to splurge and go back to the theater.I played Clue when I was a kid, and found it amusing. I'm not sure there was much story value to provide material for a feature film, but Warner's hired guns pulled it off with some fun results.It's worth a night's rental, but the film's material skews to a high PG rating. Parents of younger viewers should be cautioned.

Everyone I watch it with loves it as well, and most can recite the script along with me.I compare this movie to Napolean Dynamite.

Ask anybody who's ever watched Clue to recite a line, and they'll likely give you 10 off the top of their head. I can't believe that more people haven't seen this movie before.This is a slapstick/humor movie, period. It's not a mystery movie, it's not meant to be a who-done-it, and anyone watching it for those reasons will be disappointed. It's a comedy!! If you watch it to laugh, you will LAUGH! The script is great (minus the plot holes with certain endings) and the acting is superb. Tim Curry is perfect as the butler and has me rolling every time I watch his re-enactment.The slapstick is great ... the stairway collision! The lines are witty and funny ... The double negative has led to proof positive! The comic sequences are some of the funniest I've seen in any movie ... No there IS or no there ISN'T? ...

There the six people are greeted by the butler Wadsworth and they have dinner without Mr. Body who is told to also be a guest. Everything turns upside down as Mr. Body arrives at the mansion for the six guest to find out he is blackmailing them all with their most private secrets that could destroy their entire lives, even the butlers, unless they can kill the butler! He each gives them various weapons lead pipe, revolver, rope noose, etc. and he turns out the light. Next thing you know, the lights are on with Mr. Body on the ground and the Butler standing. With the police on their way, the whole household must find out who is the murderer.My first impression of this film, hilarious! I give my props to Tim Curry who does an outstanding job as the butler. The cast is splendid from Martin Mull to Christopher Lloyd. The story is just the same with a few tiny tweaks like there's a butler, a maid, and a cook in the house, Miss. White is now a guest instead of the maid herself, and so on. You'll catch there are a lot of mistakes during the film like Mr. Body turns a rooms lights out and it's pitch black even though there was a fire burning, but you forget all about the goofs when one by one, bodies of strangers are all disappearing and reappearing dead, having to be stored in the study. You might wet your pants from the hilarious one liners said by all the characters. Examples Green slaps Peacock and guest look at his like he's crazy. Green-  I had to stop her from screaming. Mustard-  This is war Peacock! Like the cook says, we must stick together to fight! Peacock-  But look what happened to the cook! White-  So what if my husband vanished?

I was drawn to it because it starred Tim Curry whom I had just been introduced to with with films like IT and The Three Musketeers.The plot concerns a group of strangers who are individually invited to an old house. Each character is instructed to use an alias such as Colonel Mustard, Proffesor Plum etc. It turns out that each guest has a guilty secret and someone has been blackmailing them all. Anyway to make a long story short -too late- lol (see the movie and you'll get the joke)the blackmailer turns up dead and suspicion falls on everyone but who did it and where and with what?SPOILERS COME HERE The movie is a spoof of murder mysteries. Amusingly enough it also offers 3 endings. A killer is unmasked and then just when you think the credits are going to roll some text comes on screen That is how it could have happened but what about this and then we are treated to another climax. This works well considering the game involved the players making assumptions on how it could have happened. SPOILERS END HEREThe film has a great cast. Tim Curry is a god. He seems to be enjoying every minute of this film and it really shows. He steals the whole film and is flipping hilarious. The rest of the cast all have their own memorable quotes and moments. This film is very quotable.Cop Let me out I'll book you for murder! Wadsworth What do you mean...murder? Cop I just said it so you'd open the door.Plum What are you afraid of a fate worse than death?

It's wasn't a bored game.","Date":"15 August 2013","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" If you ever want to make a movie based on a board game, look at 1985's mystery comedy 'Clue' rather than 2012's 'Battleship. The film is a murder mystery set in a Gothic Revival mansion, and is styled after 1976's Murder by Death and other various murder/dinner parties of mystery. The film was directed by Jonathan Lynn, who collaborated on the script with John Landis. If you seem any John Landis film, you know it will be kinda funny. With the movie came a novelization by Michael McDowell and also a children's adaptation. Clue was Paramount's first adaptation of a now current Hasbro property, though at that time Cluedo was owned by Waddingtons and licensed in the U.S. as Clue to Parker Brothers; Hasbro later bought both Waddingtons and Parker Brothers. This predated by 19 years Paramount's deal to distribute other films and television series based on Hasbro properties. The film starts in 1954, against a backdrop of McCarthyism, six strangers are invited to a party in a secluded New England mansion host by house butler, Wadsworth (Tim Curry). The guest are all given pseudonyms to protect their true identity from each other. During dinner, Wadsworth reveals the true reason for the dinner all of the guests are being blackmailed to hide their secrets by Wadsworth's house owner, Mr. Body (Lee Ving). Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd) is a psychiatrist who lost his license because he had an affair with a female patient. Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan) is the wife of a Senator who has accepted bribes to deliver her husband's vote. Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn) is a suspect regarding the mysterious death of her nuclear physicist husband. Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren) is a madam who operates an illegal brothel in Washington. Then Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull) is being blackmailed for scandalous pictures. Mr. Green (Michael McKean) is a homosexual, a secret that would cost him his job with the State Department if it were widely known. Some of the characters portray in the film is different from the game. Wasn't Mrs. White supposed to be a maid? Why isn't Professor Plum wearing something purple? Colonel Mustard is almost the only character that fits the board game description. Then the movie add a lot of new supporting characters. Now, why is Wadsworth in the movie? Wadsworth wants to turn Mr. Body in, but Mr. Body comes to the dinner, and reminds the guests that he can reveal their secrets in police custody and offers them an different proposition by using weapons that he has provided to each of them, they can kill Wadsworth and destroy the evidence, keeping their secrets safe. Escape isn't an option as Wadsworth holds the only key to the locked doors, and vicious dogs patrol the perimeter, thus Mr. Body turns out the lights in the room, creating a moment of chaos in which someone shoots the gun. When they are brought back up, Mr. Body is dead, seemingly murdered by an unknown cause in the study. Who done it? Watch the movie to find out. The movie in keeping with the nature of the board game, release the movie at theater with one of three possible endings, with different theaters receiving each ending. If you get the DVD release, you have all three endings. Without spoiling it, only one of the three makes the most sense, while the other two, don't with all the plot holes A fourth ending was filmed, but supposedly it really wasn't very good so it was delete. I would love to see that fourth ending. I hope somebody find it one day. The explaining of the murder can be a bit annoying since you have to remember a lot of information and scenes. Is there any way, they can simple it. It can be campy, and seem not a family friendly film with all the dark death humor and sexual content references. It's rated PG. In my opinion, it should be rated PG-13. I doubt anybody 12 or under is going to get the sexual humor dialogue. The slapstick humor was funny, as well as smart comedy dialogue. Plus, all the scenes was film in nearly one location. That's pretty awesome to say. The exterior shots of the mansion were enhanced with matte paintings by matte artist Syd Dutton, as it was looks really real landscape. Overall if you don't like the movie, you can always play the game, but if you do like the movie like me. You have something else to play one night.

What I love most about this movie is they took something which was basically nothing- that being the murder mystery game Clue, and made it a memorable and hilarious comedy. The basic plot is six guests are invited to a dinner party at the house of one Mr. Body. The guests all attend the New England mansion under Aliases. Mr. Green, Mrs. White, Mrs. Peacock, Miss Scarlet, Mr. Green, Professor Plum, and Colonel Mustard all attend. At dinner after meeting the butler Wadsworth, the Maid Yvette, and Mr. Body himself the guests learn they are all being blackmailed by Body. After one thing led to another and Body is murdered in the Study. Everyone is suspect as Body had given each guest a weapon. As the night goes on the mystery deepens as more staff such as the cook and others turn up murdered, the discovery of secret passages and the knowledge of what the guests are being blackmailed about do not fail to intrigue the mind. Though for all the mystery (there being three alternate endings) this movie shines in its comedy. The dialogue is banter, banter, and more banter, and I eat it up. Practically every exchange between characters left me either in hysterics or the small chuckle. Needless to say I spent most of my time viewing it laughing. The dialogue ranges from fast talking jokes, double meanings, to even faster talking confusing guests. Wadsworth provides much of the banter and one can see how much the actors are having fun. It is a shame some do not know this film even exists but I am glad every time I meet someone who shares a laugh at phrases such as flames on the side of my face, two corpses everything's fine , and the ever favorite one plus two plus two plus one.

But how about this?Though noticeably flawed behind frequent microscopic analysis, 1985's Clue is well-deserving of its cult status as an under-appreciated comedy as well as for its amazing repeat value on par with, perhaps, Monty Python.Using the famous board game favorite as a springboard, the film mixes the game's familiar characters with a horror movie set, 1950's paranoia, and a preposterous scenario suitable for use by either a dinner theater or Agatha Christie. Each of the game pieces from the game are present, in wonderfully over the top fashion. They all gather for a mysterious dinner party. One that ever so leisurely leads to MURDER!

I happened to fall upon it about 5 years ago and instantly fell in love with it. Since then I have seen it many times and it is now one of my favourite movies.It's 1955, and a Butler, a Maid, and 6 guests, are invited to Hill House where they quickly get involved in 6 murders! We are introduced to Wadsworth (Tim Curry) the butler who arrives first and Yvette (Colleen Camp) the French maid. Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull) arrives next followed by Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Mr. Green (Michael Mckean), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), and Ms. Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren). At the mansion they are all introduced to Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving) who they discover has been blackmailing them all. In order to keep things quiet Mr. Boddy gives each guest a lethal weapon; the lethal weapons are of course, the revolver (to Professor Plum), the lead pipe (to Mr. Green), the rope (to Mrs White), the knife (to Mrs Peacock), the Candle Stick (to Ms. Scarlet.), and the Wrench (to Colonel Mustard). He states that if they expose him to the police they will also be exposed and humiliated. When Mr. Boddy suddenly dies after being shot the group suddenly finds themselves tangled up in a web of lies, murder and hilarity as they try to find out who did it. . Clue has everything a good movie needs. It has all kinds of comedy, from slapstick to just plain funny statements. It has an intriguing mystery, with many twists and turns along the way. Tim Curry is amazing as always, Christopher Lloyd gives a solid performance as Professor Plum who lost his licence for doing the thing that male doctors aren't allowed to do with their female patients. Martin Mull, who some may recognize from Sabrina the Teenage Witch, also gives a solid performance. The acting in fact is solid all around; everyone in the cast gives a great performance.At the end of the movie they show three alternate endings each one more insane and hilarious then the other; even though some endings may not make sense or may even seem impossible it is still great because it is so insane and funny.Fans of the board game will definitely like the movie. The movie certainly has the feel of the game and the house even looks like the board. They of course did not forget the secret passageways. They do come up and later have a very big impact on the plot. Fans of Tim Curry will no doubt enjoy the movie because Tim Curry is, well Tim Curry! When all the murders have been committed he states, Alright, I know who did it, and then immediately does a whole recap of the entire movie starting from when Colonel Mustard first arrives, all the way to the point where he reveals who the murderer is. This clearly is the best scene in the whole movie because Tim Curry shows just how brilliant he is, he explains what happened, how it happened, all in about 5 breaths and while acting it all out. This scene alone will make anyone who isn't a Tim Curry fan into a Tim Curry fan; this scene illustrates perfectly why he is so respected.So this weekend, go out and rent Clue because with extremely solid performances and a great story and intriguing mystery, Clue rates at 9/10 and is clearly an 80's classic.

Truly a sight to behold, one of them would always keep detailed minutiae on their notebooks, and usually deduced Who, Where, and With What long before my pubescent self would have, well, a clue.Anyway, I remember CLUE opening at a local theatre (GCC Cherry Hill Mall 2, where I also remember seeing GUNG HO, TOP GUN, CROCODILE DUNDEE, ALIENS, and JUMPIN' JACK FLASH, and which is now, the last I heard, a labyrinthine Limited clothing shop).  Although my parents were never big movie buffs and were wary of dropping me off at the movies alone (I recall the previous year being denied the pleasure of EUROPEAN VACATION, but for some reason they okayed THE MONEY PIT), they understood my addiction to 'Clue,' and let me go.(Anyone who knows me knows that I love to drop random movie references in places they don't really belong.  So get used to it.)When CLUE played theatres, those detective notepads were handed out upon entrance, and I distinctly remember some loser usher scribbling Miss Scarlett did it on the one given to me.  I was, in hindsight, so p***ed; years of being challenged by my aunts prepared my eleven-year-old brain to solve the mystery, and some jerk ruined an aspect of the experience.  But despite being given that odious spoiler, I still had a great time.Since I was just a kid, I really didn't know any of the actors.  Of course I was familiar with Michael McKeon from Laverne and Shirley and Christopher Guest from BACK TO THE FUTURE.  But what child was privy to the delights of Madeline Kahn, or Eileen Brennan, or Tim Curry?  (My introduction to ROCKY HORROR wasn't until the next summer.)  I did, however, appreciate their fine comedic gifts, although I didn't realize it at the time.But, over time, I've been fortunate enough to see what makes them gods. Yeah, I love WHAT'S UP, DOC? in ways I can't go into right about now, but who knows if I would if I hadn't seen CLUE at a formative age?  (I am not a Eunice Burns, I am the Eunice Burns!)Where am I going with this?  Let's get back to CLUE, eh?  Back in the day a CLUE clique was formed, consisting of C.J., Jon, Chrissy & yours truly (Jen has always been a wannabe, but so has Allen - but he's worthy), and there's been many late nights when were gathered around the TV, thanking the techno gods for the VCR.  We'd pop in CLUE and each pick a role to own for the evening (I've been known to do a fierce Mrs. Peacock).  The four of us have bonded more than a few times over CLUE, and so let me take a moment to thank everyone involved.  (Thanks Mr. Lynn!  MY COUSIN VINNY is cool and all, but doesn't approach the bliss of I! Am! Your singing telegram!).Long story short (too late), CLUE is a blast if you're zoned into its vibe. Never mind how ridiculously impossible its C ending really is (the one where they ALL did it).  Just cherish it for its endless one-liners (This is WAR, Peacock!), all the red herrings, and for all those in the ensemble at the top of their craft.One plus two plus two plus one,FeverDog "},{"Title":"Great Fun","Date":"15 December 2001","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":"  Clue is extremely funny, yet has a good plot.

Comparisons to Neil Simon's 1976 masterpiece Murder By Death are obvious, especially with the presence of Eileen Brennan as Mrs. Peacock, a senator's wife who has her own share of secrets. Joining her and Curry are Madeline Kahn as a very black widow, Lesley Ann Warren as a prostitute who uses sex for more than just the money she gets from it, Peter Boyle as a perverted scientist, Martin Mull as an aggressive Army colonel, and Michael McKean as a gay FBI employee. Murder takes a while to begin, but the bodies slowly pile up in this locked old dark house where gifts of the lethal weapons are passed out to allegedly knock off Curry who has the only key to let everybody out.There are three endings to this if you want to see them all, and after the second one, I was ready for it to be wrapped up. This isn't as consistently funny as Murder By Death, and to be honest, I enjoyed the Gene Wilder/Gilda Radner flop comedy Haunted Honeymoon slightly more than this. Still, it has many amusing moments. Mrs. Peacock is a man? (Slap, slap....), and Curry's energetic performance running all over the house, while Kahn gets some tongue-twisting lines that proves almost 20 years after her sad early death that she remains one of the funniest women in the movies. Hiding her subtle beauty in a Chita Rivera Spider Woman wig, she delivers each line as if she was one of the dobermans devouring the bone that Curry threw at them before stepping into the unseen poop. The three men aren't as funny as the women, with Brennan going overboard delightfully as a matronly woman who is obviously a nervous wreck, and gets more and more frantic. Bit parts of the French accented maid and Asian cook are well cast, and while the film has mainly the house as its set, it is never claustrophobic. Far from a perfect comedy, this is still old fashioned fun with only a touch of modern sexual sensibilities added to give it a non G rating.

Believe or not this film is also another childhood relic of mine, I saw this film when I was about 8, I was fascinated with the mystery/detective and noir genre since I was into the TV show Magnum P.I even the film The Great Mouse Detective but I never saw a live action movie mystery/suspense thriller in my life, when I bumped into this film I was blown away, so this was literally the first one I saw and it's still one of the best.What makes it even more interesting was the fact it was based on my favorite board game Clue. It was to me a really cool if daft concept making a film based on a simple game, this was way before video game movie adaptations were conceived. But surprisingly it worked because not just was the film true to the spirit of the game but it was it's own thing.I do like the who dunnit mystery, it really is intriguing and just like the game it keeps you thinking. From the actual weapons and locations of the mancion to keep track of. I love the fact that despite likely suspect it's not obvious, most mysteries now unfortunately have this bad habbit of waving the answer right in front of us which really I feel nullifies the intrigue, not giving us enough of a chance to figure some things out ourselves. But this film really does give you that chance, because just like the characters figuring things out we're just as much in the dark; from the fact we don't really know any of the characters fully from certain things we discover about them we don't have a reason to. But also on simply the when, where, why, and how each incident occurs. We always get a new piece of the puzzle and it would cause us to think back on how it fits. However, it's the comedy and the ensemble cast that really powers it. The comedy is just great the verbal humor is just fantastic there is some sharp, hilarious, and clever dialog that it might take more than one watch to get it all. Each of the cast members play the mixed and colorful characters from the board game well, their not exactly characters but more the typical character archetypes from any of the old murder mystery mancion stories.The late great Madeline Kahn is great as Ms. White, whom is pretty much the Black Widow whom has a heart of ice. It's funny how dryly funny she really is, my favorite moment was when she tells the story about a couple of her dead husbands, I find it blackly humorous not just from how bizarre the deaths were but how it makes her obviously suspicious. Martin Mull is also great as Colonel Mustard whom is hardly true to his rank since in reality he's really a complete wuss. Lesley Ann Warren whom at the time was kinda hot really fits the role of Ms. Scarlett well, she has a sort of crackling charisma.Though my favorite character is Wadsworth played by one of my favorite actors Tim Curry he is just fraking hilarious, this is probably my favorite role from him. He just has some of the best lines and dialog, I love how energetic he is as well as really smart and in control, really does work well under pressure in an uncontrollable situation and looks like any moment he could lose his composure. He's probably the only sympathetic one of the bunch (or it seems that way) since his motive in things seem more genuine. My favorite moment with him was no doubt when he explains how he solves the case by going step by step, which really involved him doing a lot of physical comedy and talking quickly which all admit was both hilarious and exhausting.The parody in this film works, there are all of the clich√©s and elements from those murder mansion mysteries, some obvious but others are suttle or addressed. One favorite quote of mine is Comunism is a red herring. it's funny because it's true it was a common clich√© in most suspense thrillers at the time where the perpetrator was usual a spy for the Russans.I really love the three scenario ending which I thought was brilliant, and makes sense since the board game Clue was also about a single player constructing any mystery scenario they want, to set up anyone to be the guilty culprit. In the theaters these ending shown randomly depending on which showing you came to. It's was a risky but great move, it would be awesome if may'be a comic book movie thought of doing that if they wanted to go the what if direction.This film like any great mystery is a great find.Rating 4 stars "},{"Title":"Defied my expectations in the best way possible","Date":"2 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" I didn't expect too much from this movie.

But it's nearly always disappointing to go back and revisit childhood favourites and while Clue isn't a disappointing movie by any stretch of the imagination, I didn't enjoy it as much as before. It is a real curiosity, being the only film I can think of based on a board game and also offering three different endings. But some things were exactly as I'd remembered, namely some astoundingly hammy acting and a fairly dodgy script.On a dark and stormy night, six strangers are invited to an isolated manor house for a formal dinner. Being greeted by the butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry) and informed that they must stick to their given aliases, the only thing initially that links Miss Scarlett (Leslie Ann Warren), Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), Mrs Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Mrs White (Madeline Kahn) and Mr Green (Michael McKean) is that they are being blackmailed by Mr Boddy (Lee Ving). But when Mr Boddy is found dead in the study, it plunges them all into a complex web of lies, secrets and murder.It might not be a long film but Clue is a brave attempt at stringing a concept out as much as possible. But the whole thing feels like a pantomime, packed to the rafters with hammy acting (none more so than Curry, given that hammy is what he does best) and a ridiculous story in a clich√©d setting. But then again, that was the point of the game - to make you feel like you were stuck in an Agatha Christie novel. It just never feels like anyone is taking it seriously which makes suspension of belief a little tricky. That being said, this is still a sporadically entertaining mystery movie and one which uses all the ideas in the game well. It is recognisably based on Clue (or Cluedo as I knew it here in the UK) and I can't imagine any other film using a board game as a source. Can't imagine a movie based on Monopoly, for example.Clue is certainly unique and as such, it is a difficult film to review. It's daft, childish and frankly a little silly but if you can take it with a pinch of salt then you may enjoy this movie. It remains a real oddity and a genuinely cult movie, something a little different from the norm and therefore, something for those of you fed up with endless Columbo cases. Once the murder happens, the film drags its feet towards the conclusion which seeing as all three are included whenever the film appears on TV, weakens the film even more. A missed opportunity then.

They've all got secrets, they're all horrible people, and yet the viewer can't help but be intrigued by and even grow to like them. The quips, wordplay and one-liners are executed by this perfect cast so well that all of this movie's inherent flaws (there's really not much of a plot, Lee Ving as Mr. Boddy is pretty forgettable, some details of the multiple endings don't make sense, etc.) are easily forgiven if only because the movie as a whole is just so much fun. All in all, even though the math may not seem right, the whole package adds up to my favorite movie ever. I can't wait to watch it with my kids someday.

The environment is very realistic (in some moments it seemed to see the castle of Frank 'N'Furter), the rhythm is fast and the actors are in good form. To invent such a nice intrigue founding only itself on a game surely is not easy. Instead the gags are exhilarating and unbelievable. The originality of this movie is in the three endings (the quarter has disappeared with the first husband of Mrs White, the illusionist!) maybe very obvious but genial in their normalcy. The actors, already famous in the 80's, surely promised a fable future. As to forget Madeline Kahn (unfortunately dead of cancer in 1999), 4 nominations to the Golden Globes, wife of the great Mel Brooks, extraordinary in her acting full of irony and of sense of humor, testified by the cult movie Young Frankestein. And as to forget Christhoper Lloyd, winning of 3 Emmy Awards, with that always problematic characters as the extraordinary crazy scientist of Back to the Future. All these great actors reunited in a movie that could not pass unnoticed. But there is another great actor that seems us fundamental to name Mr. Tm Curry. Practically the whole movie is on his shoulders. He has supported the weight of his acting and that of the others he has been the pivot of the game, the satellite gone crazy that governed that small universe made of assassins and blackmails. And he has brightly passed the examination. It's amazing to see him to his ease with the actors of that talent his bravura has surely emerged and his identity has been built definitively. With this movie Tim Curry has still underlined the word talent already writing in the movie RHPS.

Yes, please, you can praise Madeline Kahn all the day long, as far as I'm concerned; she was a gargantuan talent and I still weep for her loss. But they are all 2-dimensional characters in Clue.

However, it did bear an uncanny resemblance to another film, Murder by Death (that starred Truman Capote).About half way thru the film (45 minutes), I felt it begin to fall apart. The film really got out of hand when Tim Curry began to drag the group thru the house on the reenactment tour.  At that point, the film degenerated completely into a vehicle for Tim Curry to show off his talent for physical comedy.  Which wore thin very quickly in this role.I don't think the ending was done right, and some parts weren't necessary. I think Murder by Death was a much better vehicle for this plot.

The six are each greeted by a butler named Wdasworth (Tim Curry) & show to the study to relax before dinner. During dinner the six guest's question each other to try & discover the reasons behind the mysterious invitations, then Wadsworth reveals that they all have something in common. All six of them are being blackmailed by a seventh guest Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving), soon after Mr. Boddy is found murdered as someone wants to keep their indiscretion secret. Then more people turn up at the house & more people begin to get murdered, the only questions left is who did it & why?Written & directed by Jonathan Lynn & based on the popular board game Cluedo (the first time a film was based on a board game in fact) this is an extremely likable & often quite funny murder mystery that also boasts three separate endings, I must admit to not having this much fun watching a film in quite some time actually. I love a good murder mystery, I love eccentric character's, clever red herrings that keep you guessing, inventive murders & clever twist endings which I felt Clue had in abundance. The cast of offbeat character's & funny one-liners really help give the film personality & helps you follow who is who very easily, while there is a definite comedic style it never seems to degenerate into dumb slapstick (OK, maybe the bit at the top of the stairs when four people run into each other & end up on the floor but it doesn't happen often) & surprisingly the comedy & one-liners actually work & are actually fairly amusing. The murder mystery plot is good & obviously uses the character's, the setting & in particular the murder weapons from the board game & I really liked the triple barrelled ending as various scenarios of what could have happened are given by a zany hyperactive Tim Curry. A really energetic, funny & fairly clever murder mystery with great atmosphere too, a definite favourite & surprisingly overlooked little gem. What else can I say? I liked it, a lot.Besides the three endings shown in the finished film (although at the time of Clue's cinematic release only one ending was shown with the three being alternated between theatres) a fourth one was also shot but has never seen the light of day & which Wadsworth was the killer. The production design is excellent & really evokes a big stately home atmosphere full of dark corners & secret passages, it just looks great. The music is also well chosen & used.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 this had a fair bit spent on it & it shows with great looking 50's period production design. The acting is good from a solid cast, Tim Curry is great, Christopher Lloyd pops up as a womanising doctor Go-Go's guitarist Jane Wieldin has a cameo as the singing telegram.Clue is a great murder mystery with a large dose of humour thrown in, it all works really well & I think it's a great film.

During the 1950's, when the film is set, the characters from the board game show up for a dinner party, only to discover that the host is someone who has been blackmailing them. Chaos and murder follows. It could have been great, but it never was. It's not the actors' fault, as they try very hard and sometimes succeed. But they're given very little to do. For the most part, they go on some wild goose chases and stumble over each other, while looking for both a killer and the evidence the blackmailer was holding over them. The main problem is the script, which is even flatter than Clue's game board. There were a few amusing one-liners and a couple of decent sight gags, and little else. So I would recommend this only to those who are really interested in the premise of hard-core fans of the actors. It's easy to take and harmless, so if you must watch, catch it on television instead of paying money to rent it.

That's 321 fewer endings than the board game permits, but two endings more than offered by most movies.What are you afraid of, a fate worse than death? Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd) asks.No, just death, replies Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan). Isn't that enough?When I first saw this film in December, 1985, I found it a tired-feeling retread of Murder By Death, with director Jonathan Lynn's pratfall-heavy jokiness a poor substitute for Neil Simon's scriptwork. And the cast seemed a bit of a comedown, even if Brennan was in both films.But cable did funny things to me and Clue, opening my eyes to the slow-burning cleverness of Lynn's well-presented concept and a cast that, perhaps because it had no A-list stars, felt more need to dig into the material and get every last bit of funny out of it. You might miss Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn) the first time she says her husband just lies around on his back all day, but you know enough to laugh the second time.Husbands should be like Kleenex, soft, strong, and disposable, she says.You lure men to their death like a spider with flies!Flies are where men are most vulnerable.The lines are seldom as good as that, and there's some weak business involving pseudonyms and minor characters that only gets in the way of the central business. I still groan at the line Communism was just a red herring.But Clue succeeds in its central mission of merry-making, aided by the multiple-ending gimmick and Tim Curry's central role as the zany butler Wadsworth who recaps the entire movie in five minutes. The pratfalls are a lot better than I thought the first time, too.Ending C is the best, by the way, with Kahn's en fuego Yvette monologue and the famous last line, one of the best cappers of any 1980s comedy.

It is a comedy. It is a spoof of a certain genre of murder mystery. It is a farce. It is done in the style of a stage play, with a touch of Oscar Wilde. It is reminiscent of Murder by Death, but not so broad. Its cast and vocabulary is taken from the familiar children's board game.The best humour is the subtle, many throw away lines you could easily miss if you don't pay attention, many based on people misinterpreting less than perfectly unambiguous statements. This dialog roars along at breakneck speed. There are no ponderous pauses for laughs or to give you time to figure out the joke. The director wants to make sure there is more there than even the sharpest minds can grab in the first viewing. There are subtle references to Curry's famous role of Dr. Frankenfurter in Rocky Horror Picture Show. That is the undertone. There is also a layer of more overt corny humour.What bothered me about the show was the stellar cast spent much of its time just standing around, running from room to room or screaming.I'd love to see this movie again just for the few scenes where Madelaine Kahn got to do her thing. Tim Curry is a hoot, and pulls off some amazing physical humour as well.It is set in the 1940s when the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover were considered heroic and being gay was worthy of paying blackmail to keep silent.It is fluff. So long as you don't expect something deep, you will have a great time.

Among these folks are Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Miss Scarlett (Lesley Ann Warren), Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Mr. Green (Michael McKean), and a butler (Tim Curry). Almost all of them lived in the nation's capital, at some point, and crossed paths on occasion. Miss Scarlett ran an escort service, Mrs. White was the wife of a diplomat, Mr. Green worked for the FBI, etc. They have no idea why they were brought to the old mansion but soon learn that they have another connection. All of them were being blackmailed by the same man, a Mr. Body. He arrives a short while later. Also in the house are an Oriental cook and a fetching housemaid. But, soon several murders occur and the rest of the crew tries to stay alive and to figure out the identity of the killer or killers. How will it all end? The makers of this film, recognizing the popularity of the board game, have attempted to create a movie out of the slimmest of clues. While everyone knows the names of the characters, the weapons, and the rooms of the mansion, there is no further information provided by the game's creators. The result is a fair flick but one that is rather uneven. Certainly, the cast is terrific, and they try to make the most of the premise. The costumes, sets, and production values are also quite fine. However, the plot and script are of the thinnest varieties. Yes, there are some clever lines but, in truth, there is quite a bit of repetitive action, especially at the finale, where alternate endings are provided and details are hashed and rehashed. So, if you love the board game or any of the cast members, you will probably want to see this film and most likely will enjoy it, too. However, if you know nothing about the game, this movie will probably be a bit of a bore and your patience will be put to the task time and again.

The mystery aspect is fast-paced and engaging. The jokes complement the mystery very well and are highly amusing. Some mockery of McCarthy era Cold War hysteria is included in the film's jokes to great effect.

First to show up is Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), as he will be known, one of six people who have been summoned to the mansion by a mysterious letter. The others; Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn) Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Mr. Green (Michael McKean), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd) and Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), who arrive together after a car breakdown, turn up soon enough, but don't appear to know one another. Wadsworth invites them into the dining room, where they settle down for dinner, and the secrets begin to come out - they're all connected in some ways, and one of those ways just happens to be blackmail...Written by the director Jonathan Lynn from a story by him and John Landis, Clue was obviously based on the board game Cluedo, known more basically as Clue in America. The list of films based on board games is a short one, there was a musical of Chess but so far there's no sign of Monopoly The Movie or Scrabble The Motion Picture, although I hold out a little hope for an adaptation of Kerplunk. Anyway, true to the game, Clue presents a large mansion with various rooms, the Library, Dining Room, Study, Conservatory, Kitchen, and so on, and six weapons (knife, revolver, rope, lead piping, etc) to match up with the six main characters.Once seated around the dinner table, the guests learn about each other and the fact they are all connected to Washington D.C. in various ways. Then the seventh guest shows up at the house, the none-too-subtly named Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving), an obnoxious fellow who they all should know. Retiring to the lounge, they discover that they are all being blackmailed and who should the blackmailer be but Mr. Boddy? He gives them all gift wrapped presents, which when opened are revealed to be potential murder weapons. The lights go out unexpectedly and there is a commotion and when the lights go back on when Mr. Boddy is lying dead on the carpet.This film is outstandingly brilliant with a hint of stage-show comedy. The plot line is a little bland but it makes up for it with a great cast and childish humour. I would give this movie 8/10 mainly for the reason it could improve its storyline for the better.

This is one of the most fun movies that I have ever watched in my whole entire life. Now, I have never played Clue, but I know a good movie when I see it one a shelf at some store.Here is the plot of this movie. Colonel Mustard, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. Peacock, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, and Professor Plum are blackmailed by a man named Mr. Boddy. Everyone is invited by Wadsworth the butler to go to a house and have dinner. Yvette the maid and the cook for the house are involved in the blackmail too. Then, Mr. Boddy is mysteriously murdered. Anyone could have done it. Then the cook is killed. The people split up to look for the killer. Then, a motorist comes to the house. He is killed. Then an officer. Then Yvette. Then a singing telegram girl. People are dropping dead left and right. Then Wadsworth figures out who did it. Now, there are three different endings to this. The first is when Yvette and Miss Scarlet are the killers. The second is Mrs. Peacock. The third is everyone.Overall, this is a very fun movie to watch. Like I said before, there are three totally different endings. Each one has at least one good thing. The first has one plus two plus one plus one, the second has Mr, Green saying that Mrs. Peacock was a man and Colonel Mustard and Wadsworth slapping him, and the third has Mrs. White's flame speech and the infamous last lines. Now, the only thing wrong with the third ending is the fact that Wadsworth is the killer. I do not think that anyone wanted him to be the killer. My favorite is the first one being as nobody was expecting Miss Scarlet. Anyway, this is a great movie that as to be a film to watch.9/10Recommended Films Psycho.

Some of the scenes and dialogue are laugh-out-loud funny.

He didn't seem to like me very much. He had threatened to kill me in public. - Miss Scarlet Why would he want to kill you in public? - Wadsworth I think she meant he threatened, in public, to kill her.The characters may lack depth and dimension, but all are very well played by a talented ensemble cast. I've read any number of complaints about perceived plot holes, but who cares? If you're so busy noticing each time a candlestick changes places in a scene or who's holding what weapon, I think you're missing the point.

Clue is the exception, and it is exceptional. Everyone knows the story, whether they actually know how to play the game or not. Six strangers -- Prof. Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Col. Mustard (Martin Mull, of TV's Sabrina...), Mr. Green (Spinal Tap's Mike McKean), and the rest of the usual suspects -- are called to the hill-top mansion of the strange and sinister Mr. Boddy.Set against the treacherous backdrop of the Cold War, each of the six has some deep dark secret, and Mr. Boddy has the means to expose them all. But who is Mr. Boddy, and what does he want? There isn't long to ponder such things, as before too long, one of the guests has killed Mr. Boddy and put a stop to his deadly blackmail scheme. But who? Led through it all by Mr. Boddy's faithful butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry), the group must uncover the murderer's identity before the police arrive, and before they can strike again! Loaded to the brim with clich√©s, Clue is over-the-top fun. Director Jonathan Lynn (My Cousin Vinny, Sgt. Bilko) does a good job with a talented cast. But really, this is Tim Curry's movie and he is absolutely brilliant in it. While many films suffer from a poor endings, Clue has endings flying out the wazoo. It is the first (only?) movie to ever show a different ending depending on which theater you attended, and what night you saw it on. All three work well (though one is clearly best), and you can choose to watch each consecutively on the DVD.OVERALL SCORE 8.9/10 = AQuotable and infectiously fun, you can't not have a good time watching this movie.

In fact 20 years after its release people on this site love and cherish the film. They keep saying it may get remade, that may or not be true. If they do another version of Clue the script would be far from this one. I am sure it would be more of a thriller mystery with comedy in it. Madeline Kahn steals the film as always she has some of the funniest lines I ever heard. They should re-release it on DVD for a 20th anniversary but haven't so far.

I echo my friend from the UK that this movie can be watched by die-hards approximately 3-5 times a day. I recently pulled my copy out of the DVD tower and began to watch it after work. It shames the comedies of today, and sets quite a standard common with the works of Mel Brooks. The witty humor and one-liner's truly are quick, direct, yet subtle. Amazingly, after watching the movie so many times, I'm astonished how many goof's I've been missing. I found a few minor continuity goof's in addition to those listed, including the continuity of Mrs. Peacock's reaction upon being slapped from one shot to another (completely different positioning). I recommend this movie to any person who has the ability to throw and catch subtle sarcasm and hidden jokes on a daily basis.

The terrific cast have a great comic/dramatic pedigree, with Curry stealing the honours as the officious, pedantic, fast-talking butler, but I also like McKean, Warren and Camp very much. There is a great score by John Morris, terrific sets by John Lloyd and an inventive triple-ending gag (they shot three endings and varied them on theatrical prints, but then threw them all together later). I like this movie primarily because it's so nutty, but it's also such an oddball group of people who made it; Lynn was the co-creator of the British political satire Yes Minister, producer Debra Hill came from low-budget indie movies like Halloween and writer/exec John Landis was a Hollywood infant terrible - how did these three get together ?

The best performances in the movie is that of Madeline Kahn as Mrs. White, who was able to make the audience alternately hate her (as she revealed she had killed several ex-husbands) and feel somewhat sorry for her (as she is actually honest about having killed Yvette). Tim Curry and Lesley Ann Warren also performed well. The humor is also excellent; some jokes are very obvious, and others are very subtle (for example, Mr. Green asks Wadsworth if the FBI is in the habit of cleaning up after multiple murder and Wadsworth answers Yes. Why do you think it's run by a man called Hoover? (Hoover is a vacuum cleaner manufacturer)). Although not perfectly true to the board game, this movie is still highly recommended (although not for young children, as there is mild sexual content involved).

Since then (twelve years later), I reckon that I have seen it a hundred times. I love it. I more than love it.In my personal opinion, I rate this movie the second best movies that I have ever seen. The acting is terrific, and the delivery of the lines is perfect. Tim Curry is great as Wadsworth the Butler, and his explanation of the events they faced that evening is downright hilarious. Such scenes as the Singing Telegram Girl, the Poisoned Brandy, No Meaning Yes, the Kingdom of Heaven and the Cop's Tour Around The Mansion are classics.This is a great movie, brilliantly produced, acted, directed, mixed with an engaging Whodunnit. Was it the Butler? Or Col. Mustard who recently came into a lot of money? Or Mrs White, who is accused of having already bumped off her husbands? Or the lecherous doctor, Prof. Plum? Could it have been Miss. Scarlett, who runs an escort service? Or maybe it was Mrs. Peacock, the wife of a senator? Or possibly Mr. Green, who would lose his job on security grounds if his secret is unmasked? Or maybe, just maybe, it was the Cook? So Whodunnit?If you are interested in seeing it, I'd recommend the DVD version, as the VHS version (at least the ones I've seen) have been a bit out of sync in a few scenes.I'll just leave you with this comment, Is there anyone else in this house?

Tim Curry plays Wadsworth, a loquacious yet mysterious butler who welcomes guests to a dinner party at a spooky grand house in the middle of a thunderstorm.  Each guest is identified only by a pseudonym such as Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard, Miss Scarlet and so on. Sordid secrets and links with Washington DC soon emerge as the links between the guests, and murders inevitably follow.While setting the film in the cold war paranoia of America in the 50s allows some political satire to creep in (Lynn made his name with the British TV comedy 'Yes Prime Minister'), most of the fun is to be had from more straight forward one-liners and set pieces.  Wadsworth's energetic explanation(s) of the murders is infectiously entertaining. Most of the characters are a little cartoonish, but a pacy script and good performances sustain the momentum.The overall scenario is a bit preposterous, but this is good clean fun ... provided you don't mind a murder or six!

It makes an awful form of government but in the case of Clue, makes for an interesting story of murder, corruption and blackmail.  Who would have thought Communism could be so funny?The film, which features an impressive array of comedic talent (Christopher Lloyd, Tim Curry, Michael McKean, and the late Madeline Kahn) does not seem too dark despite the fact that its plot foundation is murder.The actors are incredible at bringing their characters to life, and the experience of the film leads to a new depth when playing the classic Parker Brothers game of the same name. The ending(s) are the best part.  Since each game of Clue ends differently, I find it quite clever that the brains behind Clue decided to release the film in theaters with separate endings.  And, as an added bonus, if you invest in the D.V.D, you are given the option of viewing the movie with all three endings or with one ending taken from the disk at random.For fans of the game or fans of any of the aforementioned comedic stars, Clue is a sure-bet for a good time.

For those of you who don't know the plot, it's about this party where people are invited, and the host of the party ends up dead.. more people die, blah blah blah. So they have to figure out whodunnit.  Just like in the game.  In the game of course there isn't much more to it, so the movie adds a little bit of dark comedy to it.

Six people are gathered together in a New England mansion at the time of the McCarthy hearings. Each of them has a guilty past and are being blackmailed. After the English butler exposes their blackmailer, one Mr. Boddy, Boddy gives them all weapons and tells them that the only way out is to kill the butler (Wadsworth) as only he has the evidence. But it is Mr. Boddy who ends up dead, and the body count gets higher as the frantic guests try to discover who the murderer is. The laughs come one after the other here, hardly leaving you time to breathe. The film also has it's chilling moments too, though. The murders of the Motorist, the maid and the cop still send shivers down my spine as they are filmed excellently, with the killer's identity concealed.  The performances are very good, with the scene-stealer very obviously being Tim Curry as Wadsworth, especially with his re-enactment of the murders. The only one I don't like is Eileen Brennan as the ultra-conservative Mrs. Peacock (but that's probably because I'm an out-and-out leftie!).

If you like energetic comedies that keep you on your toes, then you'd have to love this.  WAY too much to summarize here, but basically all the names from the board game show up to a perfectly spooky mansion and get entangled in a night of murder and mystery.  It's all done in a comic fashion, with nothing really violent to offend anyone.  A great cast with, if not well known, at least veteran actors who dazzle you with their ability to keep the films pace lightning quick.  Of note Mull, whenever a chandelier falls behind him, Warren with her laid back reaction to everything, and a big wow-wee! to Colleen Camp as maid Yvette, sure to bring smiles to guys and rolled eyes to girls with her overflowing cleavage.  But as most have mentioned, the real standout is Curry, an excellent actor with his words, whose best scene of his career is probably that final 10 minutes where he crazily runs about the house explaining the whole night to the guests.  And although the solutions don't make sense even after the 10th time you've seen the film, it still gives you a lot to think about.  The beginning is right on the money as well, with creepy music, dark and stormy night atmosphere and nice, slow shots introducing the house to us.  And as far as he ending(s), its nothing like you've seen in any film, and has yet to be duplicated, as you get three(!) possible outcomes to the madness.  So, give it a try but be warned it's one of those if you leave the room for a second you'll miss a ton of stuff kinda movies.  Excellent work from start to finish.

Personally I think that the characters created for Clue, are the best of all time.  Wadsworth - is he a mere simple minded butler or a witty blackmailer?  Col. Mustard - a colonial, who inherited a lot of money after his parents died.  For extra income he sells gov't secrets to foreign countries.  And there are many more characters to fall in love with.Acting -1.  On the money!  Tim Curry, Martin Mull, Leslie Anne Warren, Madeline Khan, Christopher Llyod... perfect.Cinematography -1.  Filmed on a small budget, but has the look of a big budget mystery, with no help from CGI effects.  The house on the hill at night is a truly haunting sight and the inside of the mansion is gorgeous and yet a place that no person would want to spend the night.Beginning -1.  From the moment we see Tim Curry driving his car towards the old mansion on the hill on that dark and stormy night, we are instantly intrigued.End -1.  There are three to choose from and all are great, although I personally like #3.Memorable -1.  Absolutely.  The singing tell-a-gram girl scene; the I had to stop here from screaming scene; the introduction of the characters; everything stands out.Believability -1.  If you were stuck inside a mansion in the middle of nowhere, what else would you do besides try your best to find the killer and stay alive til the police come?Attention Holding -1.  Clue is a puzzle, everything that a character does or says is a clue towards finding the killer.

There's few if any developed characters and there's almost too many alternative routes to take the story. That's why the board games is fun. To take that idea to a movie and even try to capture the essence of the game is a challenge and one that I don't feel is really worth taking. Clue, based on the game Cluedo which I've played but don't really remember the rules, is an interesting and entertaining attempt for the most part. However, it would be significantly better if it was more consistent. It's always trying to have to have it both ways. It can't decide if it wants to be a tongue-in- cheek mystery film with cringe-worthy puns and misunderstandings or an all out parody with slapstick humour. The two don't mould together very well. It's a shame that it's shot like it's on a stage with bland direction and photography. It means a lot of what it wants in focus is lazily placed in the frame. But this wasn't what the film was concerned about anyway. Some of the humour lands and it's great fun to keep guessing. I guess that's the main thing it carries from the game. Tim Curry is absolutely brilliant as Wadsworth, especially his energetic performance in the third act and Spinal Tap's Michael McKean and Lesley Ann Warren were other highlights. I wish they made up their mind and went for the final of the three alternative endings because that really stunts the film's momentum and kinda made the most sense.6/10 "},{"Title":"The Greatest Murder-Mystery-Comedy Ever","Date":"18 March 2010","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" There are few movies that change the nature of film...This is one of those movies.

The filmmakers did go a little bit far from the board game, but it was probably to make the plot better, and to make more sense. In the movie, Mrs. White was a guest, but in the game, she was the maid. Tim Curry is a riot as Wadsworth, the butler, but really Mr. Boddy. He looked hilarious when he was imitating Mrs. Peacock's screaming about the supposedly poisoned brandy. Professor Plum was funny when he kept trying to get Miss Scarlet's attention, even though she became annoyed. My favorite part is when Mrs. White, Col.

Maybe there's a reason. Then again, this could have been everything that Murder By Death is, a hilarious spoof of detective mysteries. There are a number of reasons why it isn't. The script is paperthin(you find yourself wondering what people are doing, and why), and you are given absolutely no reason to care about anyone or anything, so, well, you don't. These great talents are assembled and made to ham it up and offer no substance to their cardboard cutout characters. They have nothing to work with. This has them running around, yelling, falling over each other, being in hysterics, doing weird stuff to get cheap laughs. Oh, and one of them is fat. Another is gay. A third(the hot French maid, a great-looking Colleen Camp) shows cleavage(I appreciate it... it didn't make me laugh). That's the level of most of the humor. This is one of those intolerable ones where they think that just because they say, are or do something that you wouldn't, it's automatically hilarious. No effort put into the delivery of the material(by the writers; again, these are skillful comedians... actually, looking at what else Lynn has directed, it's clear, what with Greed and to an extent Sgt. Bilko, that he can render funny people irritating... all The Whole Nine Yards tells me is that Perry is lame, and I knew that). It tries *way* too hard with the humor, much of the time. This has silliness, goofiness, slapstick, wordplay(some of it dumb), cleverness and tired gags. It seldom made me laugh. Among the best parts were the satirical, commenting jokes. This is excessively confusing(again, MBD wasn't). Half a dozen strangers meet at a house one evening for dinner. As it turns out, they're all being blackmailed. And the man behind it is their host. Suddenly, he is dead... moments after they've all been handed a weapon each. All have motive, as well. The dialog is fast. This has twists, obviously. They almost hold up. I mean, they don't make logical sense, if that's what you're hoping for. They could have happened, sort of. There is a little disturbing content, sexual suggestion and mild to moderate language in this. The DVD comes with all three endings(with only one, it seems like this would be only 70 minutes, not 90), and it can either play a random one or all three; it also comes with a trailer.

With a hodgepodge cast, including Rihanna, Liam Neeson and Taylor Kitsch, it was pretty much unbearable from beginning to end. Has Hollywood become so stifled of good original storytelling that it has resulted in adapting boardgames? With Hungry Hippos and Monopoly on the way, I was stunned to discover that Jonathan Lynn (Yes Minister, Nuns on the Run) kickstarted the trend with Clue (Cluedo, in the UK), a goofy farce rework of the classic 'whodunnit?' game.Set in New England, 1954, it all kicks off with cackling thunder and torrential rain, as Tim Curry - playing totally to-type as the stuffy English butler Wadsworth - enters a huge Gothic mansion. From here, a series of invited guests, travelling under the pseudonyms of Col. Mustard, Mrs White, and the like, arrive for an evening's dinner of self-discovery, blackmail and murder. Whose their dinner host? This central question becomes all the more fatal when they each seem to be dropping off like flies. Murder weapons including lead pipe, candlestick and the classic revolver, there's a killer lurking in the study, billiard room and beyond, but who is it?Co-written by eighties movie monolith John Landis (The Blues Brothers, American Werewolf in London), there's a lot of flippant black humour in Clue's script, from bawdy sight gags, to wriggling corpses. It takes great influence not only from the Hasbro board game, but from the superior seventies comedy/mystery caper Murder By Death, starring Peter Falk. The ensemble cast try their hardest to emanate the same magic and momentum. Curry is great, putting in a sublime physical performance as the sleuthing butler keeping the guess-who game rolling. Whilst Michael McKean, directly following peerless mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, exhibits a great slapstick streak as the former state official-cum-timid homosexual Mr. Green. Never given enough clues to figure out to who the murderer could be, meaning that Lynn gives us three disparate here's how it could have happened endings. But by this point, we're exhausted, just waiting for the gambit to be up.Irregardless of some brilliantly thespian performances and welcomingly frenzied pacing, something doesn't quite stack up in the entertainment department with Clue. It's certainly worth a roll of the dice, but I'd much rather spend a rainy Sunday afternoon playing the original board game.

Tim Curry as Wadsworth, the puckish butler becomes the Ringleader for a morbidly funny circus that also involves Mrs. Peacock, the dim-witted senators wife; Miss Scarlet, the skanky Washington Madame; Mrs. White, nerotoic wife of a few missing husbands; Mr. Green, the accident prone quasi-homosexual politician; Colonal Mustard, a radio stealing serviceman; and Professor Plum, a psychiatrist who gets personal with his lady patients.  The great thing about this movie is that it is pure comedy and one-liners (Why would anyone kill the cook?  Dinner wasn't that bad.) with substantial plot underneath.  Everytime you watch the movie, some little detail catches your attention and helps you understand the movie a little more.  Also, these actors and actresses (Curry, Warren, Brennan, Kahn, Camp, Lloyd, McKean and Mull) have an amazing type of chemistry together.  It seems almost believable that these people are trapped in a big gothic mansion with a killer.  In spite of that, they still manage to keep a sense of humor about them.  This movie just rocks.  It's well written, well acted movie thats worth watching a few times (or maybe 200).  In case anyone didn't hear, Madeline Kahn (Mrs. White) died yesterday (12/4) of ovarian cancer.

Although to state that this is now the case is a massive exaggeration, this year saw the release of Battleship, obviously based on the classic 'hit' or 'miss' two-player game. It reminded me of this 1985 oddity, which I had recorded from TV as a child and naturally watched it to death, though I remembered little to nothing about it, other than it starred Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd. Based on the board game Clue (or Cluedo to us Brits and probably everyone else outside of America), it tells the story of a group of misfits with a lot to hide arriving at a remote mansion, with butler Wadsworth (Curry) playing the host and guide.The group consists of Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Professor Plum (Lloyd), Mr. Green (Michael McKean), Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull) and Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), who after eating dinner are ushered into the rest area to meet their blackmailer, Mr Boddy (Lee Ving). They are each handed one of the trademark weapons (revolver, wrench, rope et al), but when the lights go out, a gunshot rings out and Mr. Boddy (get it now? Har har!) lies apparently dead but with no bullet wound. Soon, the group of dashing about the house as bodies pile up and more questions are raised.Yes, this is admittedly a slim plot, with very little going on to justify 90 minute running time, but it remains amusing enough throughout to avoid being a total disaster. The climax sees three different endings played out with Wadsworth offering three explanations and offering three different murderers. During its theatrical run, the film offered one of these three different endings depending on which cinema who would unfortunate enough to be in. This is a nice idea, which makes it a slight shame it tanked and failed to earn back its budget. But the cast is surprisingly good for such a forgettable film, with Curry offering plenty of energy, and Madeline Kahn being as brilliant as she always tends to be. Better than it has the right to be, but still offering relatively little in terms of humour and set-pieces.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Gimmick works, movie doesn't","Date":"3 February 2012","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" Clue, the movie where if you don't like the ending don't despair because we've got two more endings you can try and maybe you'll like one of those better. An interesting gimmick. Sadly, that gimmick is about the only interesting thing the movie has to offer. When you're making a movie out of a board game you can't expect to produce a cinema classic. All you're looking to do is make a movie that's fun. And this movie just isn't fun enough. The performers have a good go at it, most notably a deliriously over the top Tim Curry, but the material lets them down. Jokes fall flat, the movie drags and by the end you really don't care who did it. And finding out who did it is the whole point of the movie so that's a problem.The movie sets itself up the way anyone who's ever played the game knows it would. All the famous characters are brought together in a secluded mansion. Mrs. Peacock, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, Professor Plum and Colonel Mustard. Somebody ends up lying dead on the floor. Who did it? And where? And with what? Well the where part is no great mystery. Or is it? There may be surprises to come. Anyhow our six suspects must figure out which of them is the killer. They are assisted by the butler Wadsworth, who serves as a sort of master of ceremonies for the bizarre evening, and the French maid Yvette. Along the way more bodies pile up. Attempted jokes pile up too but so many of them miss the mark. The comedy falls flat and the movie does too. None of the six suspects really stands out. Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to point your suspicions in any one direction. But the effect is that bland characters make a bland movie. Michael McKean's Mr. Green and Madeline Kahn's Mrs. White are particularly dull. No fault of the performers, they really have nothing to work with. Even Christopher Lloyd, playing Professor Plum, is rather dry and boring. If you can make Christopher Lloyd boring you've really done something. Not something good though. Lesley Ann Warren does make a ravishing Miss Scarlett, always my prime suspect when I played the game. But she's upstaged in the va-va-va-voom department by Colleen Camp's wonderfully bouncy Yvette. Martin Mull makes no real impression as Colonel Mustard. Eileen Brennan's Mrs. Peacock does have some personality but she's more annoying than anything else. It's really left to Curry, playing Wadsworth, to inject some life into the movie. And he tries. Boy does he try, never more so than near the end with his madcap recap of events. But game as Curry is he can't perform a total salvage job on this largely disappointing movie. It's a whodunit where the answer is who cares?

It all adds up to a very confusing plot (which, in fairness, the movie pokes fun at itself over) and ultimately the movie offers three scenarios as to who the killer is and why the murders took place.There's a lot of energy involved with this, but for me the absolute impossibility of piecing together the story and guessing what had happened took away some of the enjoyment.

While I can't say it sounds like a good idea on paper, this strange brew of tongue-in-cheek one-liners and plot holes almost works.The characters from the board game are pseudonyms given to the members of a party of aristocrats, who have been invited to a mansion by a Mr. Boddy.  Mr. Boddy's butler, Mr. Wadsworth, reveals that Mr. Boddy has been blackmailing each individual.  Soon, Mr. Boddy turns up dead, along with the cook, and the remaining guests scramble to find out which of them is the killer, before the police arrive.  In between all this, several unexpected visitors arrive, lending more comic frenzy to the search for the killer.The main problem I have with this film is that there's nothing to the characters.  Films based on novels already have pre-set, pre-developed characters, but characters in a board game are all lifeless clones, the only difference being the name and appearance so the players can tell their pieces apart.  Likewise, with the exception of Tim Curry, who steals every scene as the eccentric butler Wadsworth, the characters in the film are wooden and undeveloped, with vague backgrounds and details that affect the story only through references in sarcastic remarks by other characters.  Perhaps the only reason Wadsworth was written in to be such a memorable character is because he's not in the game, and the writers didn't have to worry about any backlash for ruining the game's reputation.  The more likely reason for the lack of character development is that by trying to center on all 7 characters (probably to capture the feel of the board game), no character is given any chance to shine, not even Wadsworth. When first released in theatres, 1 of 3 endings was substituted in for each different showing of the film (my favorite is the real ending, the 3rd one).  While this is a good idea, if one was paying attention, the details of the endings totally contradict previous events in the movie (see the goofs section).  However, I didn't notice, because, frankly, there wasn't much in the film worth paying attention to.

Need I say more? A film that is watchable for butler Tim Curry's performance, but nothing else. Six guests (Eileen Brennan, Martin Mull, Michael McKean, Christopher Lloyd, Lesley Anne Warren and Madeline Kahn) come together at a large mansion in the middle of nowhere and a mystery starts and the guests must figure out who the culprit is with the clues provided by the servants. A fast little film that drags out with silly dialogue and down-right poor direction. Some real good moments were possible, but like the entire production there are way too many missed opportunities here. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

Thankfully though the pair have not been too successful, otherwise we may have had a spate of 'board game' movies on our hands. Imagine Monopoly the movie, or even worse, Trivial Pursuit.I would certainly only recommend Clue to those who like plenty of hammy humour. If you're looking for a classic murder-mystery, or even a riotous satire, then you'd better forget it! With three alternative endings, you've really got to be in the right frame of mind, and take everything at face value.The entire cast (including Eileen Brennan, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Madeline Kahn, Lee Ving, Leslie Ann Warren, Colleen Camp and Martin Mull) get plenty of opportunity to over act, and all seem to enjoy themselves, especially Tim Curry, who exudes energy and basically runs the show.Clue is never particularly clever nor outrageously funny, though it has enough moments, both sharp and stupid, to keep most audiences interested.Tuesday, February 27, 1996 - Video "},{"Title":"Sleepy","Date":"9 May 2014","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" Clue is a movie about 6 guests, a butler, and a maid, who are all involved in the murders of 6 people. The guests all meet at Hill House, where you learn that Professor Plum works in D.C., where everyone else lives. Colonel Mustard is a client of Miss Scarlet, who is the ex-employer of Yvette, the maid, who had an affair with the husband of Mrs. White, etc. When Mr. Boddy, who is blackmailing each guest, gives the guests each a weapon, he tells them they should kill Wadsworth, the butler, to avoid being exposed. With Mrs. Peacock's craziness, and Mr. Green's clumsiness, the whole group finds themselves tangled in a web of murder, lies, and hilarity. My memory is that this movie was not a hot when t was released AND they had several different endings depending on the theater you want to.I know this film has some good reviews here but I found it sort of trite and boring.

Only when the lights go out, Mr Boddy is killed.As a comedy, this movie rarely hits the mark even though it has some great comedic actors. Colleen Camp shoving her boobs around is probably the only marginally funny thing in this movie. The dialog and the slapstick is more random than funny. It's all too frantic. The characters are too one dimensional.Then there is the most compelling part of this type of movie. It is to guess who the killer is. It's the bread and butter of all murder mysteries. However this movie has 3 different endings. It shows the pointlessness of guessing because it's all very random. Any incentive to guess is gone.

Tim Curry plays Wadsworth the butler, who hosts six guests(played by Michael McKean, Madeline Kahn, Martin Mull, Eileen Brennan, Christopher Lloyd, and Lesley Ann Warren) who become involved in an elaborate murder mystery involving their host, the maid, a singing telegram girl, etc. Who did it, and why? Despite some potential, film just isn't that funny as a comedy, nor intriguing as mystery, though is directed and acted in a frenzied fashion that becomes tiresome. Not much atmosphere either, though does have a game cast at least, and the sudden fate of the singing telegram girl proves the funniest scene.

This is NOT a negative statement as the film makes no pretense. Yet, oddly, the featured review currently appearing on IMDb gives this film a 10! Now I am happy that they liked the film...but it's a freakin' board game! Have some perspective, folks.The movie is not the least bit subtle...and it's pretty clear it's not meant to be. The humor is often very, very broad and the characterizations are the same. It's best that you know this going into the film. In many ways, it really reminded me of the wacky Murder By Death--though I think I liked Murder By Death a bit more--mostly because it made me laugh. Clue only made me smirk...a bit.I could try to explain the film, but there are already quite a few reviews that do this. The story IS Clue---with the same characters (with new back stories) and a murder. Nothing more, nothing less. Provided you just want a nice time-passer and don't expect more, you'll enjoy it.

In fact, I remember watching this movie as a child and enjoying it quite a bit as well. Unfortunately I can't say the same now. This is a silly, boring and corny movie.The main problems are a boring plot, lame acting, and corny humor. Most of the jokes are groaners of the eye-rolling variety, there's definitely nothing actually funny occurring. As for the plot, it's uninteresting and ultimately pointless. The acting is lame across the board, and does nothing to draw the viewer into the lame-ass story. Basically, this is an hour and a half of my life that I'd like back.In any event, the most enjoyable part of this movie was watching Yvette's (Colleen Camp) bountiful cleavage jiggle for 90 minutes.You're better off avoiding this mess.

Basically, set in 1954, six guests have been invited by an anonymous person to the secluded New England mansion Hill House for a party with no explanation, and possibly some connection to each other. Serving in the house is butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry), who also knows nothing, and the guests include scandalous Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), psychiatrist Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Senator's wife Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), illegal brothel owner Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), Pentagon worker Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), and ex-State Department worker and homosexual Mr. Green (Michael McKean). After dinner, that is when Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving) reveals himself to be the one who invited them all, and he also tells them that he has been blackmailing all of them because they all have secrets they don't want spreading. He offers them all the chance to silence by giving them a variety of weapons to kill him with, these being a candlestick, a rope, a lead pipe, a wrench (or spanner), a dagger and a revolver (pistol/gun). When the lights suddenly go off we hear a shot and some clanging, and Mr. Boddy is lying supposedly dead on the floor, and there is no way of telling which of the guests did it, all are denying it. To determine the guilty person they explore the house to find clues or maybe find someone hiding, and along the way, Mrs. Ho the Cook (Kellye Nakahara), maid Yvette (Colleen Camp), a stranded Motorist (Jeffrey Kramer), a Cop (Bill Henderson) and a Singing Telegram Girl (Jane Wiedlin) are victims too. Finding hidden passage ways going to the lounge, the library, the kitchen, the dining room and hall, Wadsworth thinks he has cracked the identity of the murderer, and frantically runs all the facts from beginning to end. This is the point when three different endings are played, the third apparently being the real one, but in certain places there would only be one of these endings played. Ending one sees Miss Scarlet as the culprit and Wadsworth working for the FBI,and ending two sees Mrs. Peacock as the culprit and Wadsworth again with the FBI. The third ending sees everyone committed one murder, Professor Plum killed Mr. Boddy, Mrs. Peacock killed the cook, Colonel Mustard killed the motorist, Miss Scarlet killed the cop, Mrs. White killed Yvette, and Wadsworth shot the singing telegram girl, Mr. Green is FBI agent and shoots Wadsworth. The script is most of the time is too overcomplicated to keep track of, it is after all using all the clich√©s from Agatha Christie mysteries, and is isn't all that funny as a period comedy, overall, a pretty terrible crime spoof. Cluedo the board game was number 15 on 100 Greatest Toys. Adequate!

Especially film mysteries. And this one has a very promising foundation a parody of a parody `Murder by Death,' which itself was rather clever in a lowbrow sort of way.Add to this the also clever notion of building on the popular board game where fates shift and each edition is different. This led to a theatrical release where you could see different `solutions' depending on what day you paid. Add in some rather good actresses (for this, you don't need good actors) and things are off to a good start. Especially when one of the `solutions' is that everyone was guilty of a murder (related to past sins for which they are being blackmailed).But alas, this fell under the gaze of Gruber and Peters. They are not the worst offenders in the history of the dumbing down of film imagination, but they were the most consistently bad. (Add your own retroactive curse here.)So what we have is all but the last ten minutes of dog poop, breast jiggles, and supposedly comic reactions. The whole thing is pasted together by a hack director. This film has only one brief moment of value in one of the endings, Madeline Kahn admits that she killed someone and she has a little bit about fire coming out of her head. It is so deft, and so wonderful, one wonders how it survived.Ted's evaluation 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with your time.

The concept is of course taken from the board game 'Clue' (or 'Cluedo', depending on where you live) and the publicity for the movie claims that the suspicious characters and sinister rooms made famous by the popular board game have come to life.  The characters however, aside from their nomenclature, bear very little resemblance to those of the Waddingtons game (the Reverend Green has been de-frocked, Mrs. White has transformed from a frumpy cook into a black-widow, and none of them wear the colour of their name).But the real attraction of the movie is its legendary alternative endings. Six unlikely guests - all of whom have secrets to hide - are invited to dine at a spooky old manor.  The aptly named Mr. Boddy is the first to be murdered during the course of the evening, and, as the corpses begin to pile up, the race is on to find out who did it, with what, and where.  The film offers three possible solutions to the crimes for the viewer to mull over. .. . . . . . . .There is no doubt that the plotting is (by necessity) very clever, but it is also far too complex to make sense of in a single viewing.  Astute viewers will also pick up on several storyline holes that make all three endings unlikely, if not impossible.  The movie is presented (quite rightly) as a farce, and while the pell-mell rush of the end sequences is excellent, it fails to fire for the first 30 minutes, by which time its audience will probably have tired of the stale old campy word-play.  Perhaps this sort of thing is best left to the British.

But I felt especially sorry for Tim Curry, stuck in the middle of this train wreck, frantically trying to keep track of the happenings long after anyone but a masochist would have stopped caring.

The thought of someone actually going to see all three makes me feel sad and disturbed.The only, and I mean ONLY, reason I can see for watching this movie is Colleen Camp's prodigious bosom in her French maid's outfit. Lesley Ann Warren must be secure in her ability as an actress to have been able to give a professional performance while being upstaged this way. Why did I watch the film?
