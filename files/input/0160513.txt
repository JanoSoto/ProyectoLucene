[{"Title":"Involving, Affecting Drama from Scott Elliott","Date":"11 July 2002","Score":"24 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Strong performances by Sigourney Weaver and Julianne Moore highlight this involving and, at times emotionally draining film about the boundaries that are inherently a part of our lives, and the limits of those boundaries, both in how much we are able to give, as well as how much we can take.  `A Map of the World,' directed by Scott Elliott, examines the confines of the parameters within which an individual must live, and the finite capacity of any one person to endure stress that exceeds the specific limitations established for that individual by nature.  And it's not a matter of one knowing one's limitations; rather it is a matter of knowing how to cope with the results, once one has been driven past the breaking point into a world that can no longer be viewed in black and white, but only in shades of gray-- that point beyond right or wrong or what is politically correct; the point at which nothing matters but survival-- how to live in a world that can have so much to offer, while being so relentlessly unmerciful and decidedly unforgiving at the same time.Transplanted from the big city to a farm in Wisconsin, Alice and Howard Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver, David Strathairn) are attempting to make a go of their own dairy business.  But it isn't easy.  Howard is immersed in his work, while Alice, in addition to taking on the full time responsibilities and pressures of raising their two daughters and maintaining the household, also works as a school nurse.  And though Alice likes her life, the constant strain of keeping her own life on task, as well as seemingly everyone else within her sphere of existence, begins to take a toll on her.With no respite from the daily grind, Alice becomes increasingly exhausted and exasperated.  She finds some solace in her close friend, Theresa Collins (Julianne Moore), but what she really needs is some time to herself; some time to clear her head and regroup.  Instead, an unexpected summer tragedy strikes the Goodwin and Collins households, which damages Alice's much needed relationship with Theresa.  And as if that isn't enough, further trials and tribulations are about to descend upon Alice-- one of those curves life has a way of throwing at you when it's least expected, or needed.  And it's something that will test the limits of Alice's capacity to endure, more than ever before.Working from a remarkably insightful screenplay by Peter Hedges and Polly Platt (adapted from the novel by Jane Hamilton), director Elliott presents a genuinely honest film that takes an in-depth look at what it often takes just to `maintain' on a daily basis, and the very real issues and situations that a person like Alice is apt to encounter.  From the very beginning, Elliott establishes the credibility of the film by creating an atmosphere and setting that is entirely real-- so real, in fact, it will be more than a bit disconcerting to many who will so readily be able to identify with Alice and relate to her situation.  And, having effected such realism, Elliott then moves on to deliver a thoroughly engrossing, emotional drama, which he renders with great care and sensitivity.Elliott achieves success with this film through an obviously keen understanding of the material, the story, and the characters and their corresponding attitudes and reactions to given situations.  And he keeps it `real' throughout by eschewing any superfluous melodrama or sub-plots, the likes to which a film like this in lesser hands could easily lend itself. In the final analysis, Elliott knows what he wants to convey, and furthermore, knows how to do it by exacting the kind of performances from his actors that really sells it.As often happens (too often, in fact), the extraordinary performances in this film were inexplicably overlooked (as well as the film itself) and/or ignored.  Sigourney Weaver gives a commanding performance as Alice, arguably as affecting and effective as the work that earned Hillary Swank the Oscar this year for her portrayal of Brandon Teena in `Boys Don't Cry.'  This is quite simply some of the best work Weaver has ever done, and it's a shame that she has not enjoyed the kind of acclaim that would accompany such an accomplishment in a perfect world.  Which adds some irony to the whole thing, inasmuch as part of what this film is attempting to convey (and does so, successfully) is that we do not, in fact, live in a perfect world. All that aside, this is a memorable portrayal, in which Weaver exhibits a phenomenal depth and range of emotion.The field was strong in the Supporting Actress category this year (Angelina Jolie received the gold for `Girl Interrupted'), but Julianne Moore's performance here stands alongside any of those honored with a nomination for their work.  Like Weaver, Moore faced the challenge of creating a character that is so mainstream and `normal'-- one of those everybody's neighbor or the-clerk-at-the-store type of roles-- that the real difficulty lay in making it look so natural, which when successfully effected, makes it all look so `easy.'  Which is exactly what Moore did with her portrayal of Theresa.  And-- again, like Weaver-- it's a performance for which she has never received the deserved acknowledgement.  Suffice to say, it's terrific work, and a big part of what makes this film so emotionally stirring.Also effective is David Strathairn as Alice's self-absorbed husband, Howard, a man suffering from a terminal case of tunnel vision.  How good he is here, in fact, can be measured by the feelings of disdain he manages to evoke toward his character, which at times, is quite substantial.The supporting cast includes Arliss Howard (Reverdy), Louise Fletcher (Nellie), Sara Rue (Debbie) Nicole Parker (Sherry) and Aunjanue Ellis (Dyshett).  An ardently thought provoking film, `A Map of the World' invites a sense of introspection and reflection; a film that's definitely going to make you do some thinking.  9/10.

The merits go specially to a very fine cast and a clever, well written screenplay. Sigourney Weaver really shines here, in an Oscar caliber performance, as Alice Goodwin, a woman who is not afraid to show what she is feeling. She is married, has two young girls, lives in a farm and works at a school nursery. Her life seems calm, but happy, until a terrible accident happens, followed by a sad mistake, and her life falls apart.A Map of the World had everything to be a bland and conventional film, but it is not. I have to say that I don't give any merit to the direction- this is indeed the main problem. The director doesn't captivate the audience, and doesn't seem to care about that. There are many slow moments and scenes that could have been cut. But A Map of the World is a rarity- a very good film with mediocre directing. Who is the miracle maker? Sigourney Weaver, surely. She shows passion for acting and an incredible strength as Alice Goodwin. I can't imagine anyone else playing Alice, because Sigourney is perfect building her character. The Oscar was gone, but I put Weaver on my list of snubbed stars this year. But she doesn't work alone- Julianne Moore is here, and when she is in you can expect much. I'm a fan of Ms. Moore since I've seen her in Short Cuts, and now that I've seen Magnolia (if you've read some of my reviews you know how much I praise Magnolia) I'm starting to adore this lady. She shines even in slapstick comedies as Nine Months... There's nothing she can't do!Getting back to A Map of the World, I have to say that I appreciated very much its screenplay. It was written with strength, trying to escape of the clich√©s even in courtroom scenes. There are many beautiful messages the film has to pass and it should be admired for this. It shows that everyone commits mistakes, more than one time, and that is why we are ordinary people, with qualities and flaws. We should learn with ourselves and with the others. We should believe in ourselves and try to cope with our mistakes. The film has messages like these to learn, and many others, resulting in a complex study of people in conflict.I truly recommend A Map of the World, despite its flaws. Watch it for Sigourney, Julianne and the messages and forget the weak directing. It is a worth seeing.

It has adult themes, and some very troubling subject matter. As good as Weaver is, the supporting cast also offers some very powerful moments. David Strathairn portrays Howard Goodwin, Alice's husband, as he helplessly watches the community turn against the entire family, and as he struggles with the decisions that need to be made to free Alice. Julianna Moore (as Theresa Collins, the mother whose child died while being watched by Alice) is very believable as the grieving mother, struggling with her anger toward Alice over her daughter's death, and yet also convinced that the assault charges against her are ridiculous. The scenes between Strathairn and Collins, both playing vulnerable characters dealing with circumstances completely beyond their control, are raw with emotion. The only performance I found truly disappointing was that of Arliss Howard as attorney Paul Reverdy. I didn't find him believable in the role.All in all, though, this is a strong movie, and well deserves an 8/10.

In reality, it was only 125 minutes.  That reveals something about the pace.  If you can imagine a worm burrowing through granite, you have the idea.Actually, the story was a good one.  The problem was the screenplay and the direction.  This is a story of Alice Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver) a city girl who has moved to the country so her husband could try his hand at farming.  However, this is no Green Acres.  Alice is having difficulty coping with country life and her relationship with her two children.  One day she is minding a friend's children and leaves them playing with her own children momentarily to put on her bathing suit.  Upon returning, she discovers one of her friend's little girls missing and after a desperate search finds her face down in the pond.  Subsequent to this tragic accident, Alice is accused of child abuse by another child who claims she molested him in her duties as school nurse.  The two incidents together turn the whole town ugly as they assume she must be guilty.  The story is an in-depth character study of Alice and her struggle to cope with both her guilt and innocence.  The guilt is her feeling of responsibility for the little girl's drowning and the innocence is the knowledge that she is not a child abuser.Usually I enjoy complex character studies with deep conflicting emotions, but this one left me exhausted.  This is not because of the story, but because of the script and the presentation by Director Scott Elliot.  Far too much time was spent on scenes that weren't really interesting or relevant.  The dialogue often seemed inconsistent with the characters, especially in Howard's (David Straithairn) case.  The lawyer was made to look like a buffoon.  Having seen Arliss Howard in a number of other films, I know he is a capable dramatic actor so I have to assume this was the director's interpretation of the character.  Sigourney Weaver has received much critical acclaim for this performance, but I found it to be somewhat uneven.  She was superb in parts, especially the parts where she was playing the strong woman trying to hold it all together.  However, she seemed to struggle with the vulnerable parts, as if she wasn't comfortable with the character.  I realize that part of the point was that Alice wasn't comfortable in her own skin and used a lot of defense mechanisms to cope, but Weaver seemed unnatural and forced in these scenes.  She seems to have a lot tougher time playing weakness than strength.  In that regard, Julianne Moore's performance was much better.  Her breakdown scene in the woods was compelling and heartrending.David Straithairn was well cast as the self-sacrificing and supportive husband, a role with which he is well familiar.  However, he too seemed uncharacteristically tentative.  When veteran actors have so much trouble giving confident performances, one has to wonder if there was a disconnect between the actors and the first time director.Overall, despite some good performances and a solid story, the whole project just didn't come together and dragged ponderously from scene to scene.  I rated it a 6/10.  For patient viewers only.

It still isn't something for the kids.  But if you love acting, if you love to see real emotions rather than concocted attempts to feel, then watch it. And remember to keep your own Map of the World.

Some people have sleighted this movie because of how quickly the trial is taken care of near the end, but in fact the book is the same way, and for good reason the trial is not what the story is about. Unfortunately, as with so many book-to-film translations, the poetry of the prose and thus some of the deeper meanings are lost. Some of the changes between the film and the book work effectively to condense dozens of pages into one idea (the wall of baby pictures in the jail helps quickly convey Alice's changing relationship with her unit mates), but other changes only serve to hammer home a point that was made with much more subtlety in the book. (Did we really need angry graffiti on the side of the Goodwin's house? WE GET IT -- the town didn't like them!) Pat Metheny's original soundtrack was beautifully melodic, as he usually is, but it didn't fit in with the feel of the movie, and surprisingly, it didn't have much of the Midwest sensibilities one would expect from a composer from Missouri. Nonetheless, this movie will at least be worth a video rental, especially if you are a Sigourney Weaver fan and want to see her doing something other than an _Alien_ pic. While it took me awhile to warm to it, her portrayal of Alice in the end is stunning, and much more complex than anything else in this movie.

David Straithairn also is effective as the husband, caught in a web of chaos; Weaver as a school nurse is accused of child abuse in a small Wisconsin town; this after a child she is babysitting accidentally drowns. (The mother of the drowned child is portrayed by Julianne Moore).Look for an excellent part with Arliss Howard as the defense attorney; it is a shocking surprise that 5 other children come forward accusing Weaver; it develops into a sort of witch hunt- and the actress playing the prosecutor is quite odious.A Map of the World is not an easy story to take to; there are many complicated and also malicious sides of several characters; The character Weaver portrays is complex; guilty, and angry about a child accidentally dying, she accepts prison as an appropriate sentence, and even injures herself; She remains sympathetic however, throughout this film, and that is a rare talent that many actors could NEVER carry off.

It's about the life of a married woman (a city woman) in a farming small town environment, with two young daughters and a not quite communicative husband, how things just happened one day out of the blue, and the subsequent unexpected spin-off events turning her life topsy turvy, and her unusually calm approach to it all. Nothing is what it seems - we just have to ride the enduring travails with the three principal characters.Very mature performance by Sigourney Weaver as Alice Goodwin, the seemingly always self-assured, independent, educated person in control as the wife giving instructions to her husband, as the mother handling her daughters, as the school nurse attending to the kids. She always knows what she's saying or doing. Yet she's actually holding back a lot of mixed emotions within herself, unable to let go, most of all, unable to forgive herself.Julianne Moore is Theresa, a good friend and neighbor to Alice. She gave another supporting nuance performance. David Strathairn is Howard the quiet gentle husband. Arliss Howard is the assured lawyer that Alice wanted for the case; he commented he has never seen anyone took to these wrongful accusations so well, and asked what's her trick to keep so calm and collected, to which she replied, Have you ever wanted to go away on an island&#133; That's how she felt about being away from it all - that world of conceivable madness outside.The three principals are veteran actors who have matured with such elegance and in multiple intelligent rolesSigourney Weaver is far beyond the queen of alien movies since 1979 with the subsequent three sequels, she has been the unattainable woman opposite William Hurt in 1981 Eyewitness, Mel Gibson in 1982 The Year of Living Dangerously, Michael Caine in 1986 Half Moon Street; delivered tour de force performances in 1988 Gorilla in the Mist, 1994 Death and the Maiden, 1995 Copycat. Twice opposite Kevin Kline in 1993 Dave and 1997 The Ice Storm. Comedy-wise, she shines as one of the super fun members in 1984 and 1989 Ghostbusters flicks, the wicked boss to Melanie Griffith in 1988 Working Girl, and yet another fun member of the hilarious team in 1999 Galaxy Quest.David Strathairn - I first remembered him in director Phil Alden Robinson's 1992 Sneakers with the fun ensemble cast of computer wizards Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Aykroyd; Strathairn was the wiz who's blind and what an outstanding performance he did. His other roles have been pretty much the subtle supporting man, e.g., to Mercedes Ruehl in 1993 Lost in Yonkers, as the pastor in 1998 Simon Birch, but he was definitely front and center in his long time association (since 1980 and seventh time round) with John Sayles in 1999 Limbo, delivering a terrific performance opposite Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Vanessa Martinez.Julianne Moore - I remember her initially in Robert Altman's stellar ensemble cast of 1993 Short Cuts, then her unforgettable performance in Todd Haynes' 1995 Safe; she stands out in another ensemble cast in Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 Boogie Nights. In 1999, she's in five films an outstanding delivery playing opposite Glenn Close in Altman's fun ensemble piece Cookies Fortune; another ensemble tongue-whipping cast in Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband (Oliver Parker directed); yet part of another ensemble engineered by P.T. Anderson in Magnolia; then front and center as the love of Ralph Fiennes' character in Neil Jordan's The End of the Affair; and here an effective supporting role in A Map of the World.Bold (debut) direction by Scott Elliott. A bonus is the film scored by the Pat Metheny Group - the guitar plus strings aptly complemented the mood and flavor of the plot.

The film ought to shake you up, but Elliot imbues it with a kind of cold, clinical detachment. It's like a blueprint for emotion and, while Weaver is very powerful, the material never touches you. As the friend whose daughter dies, Julianne Moore touches a few nerves and David Strathairn is very fine as Weaver's dull, uncomprehending, caring husband. But they are all acting in a vacuum.

It's beauty is organic, in that from a good story/novel comes a very finely honed and skilled script. A story that manages the odd laugh in some very dark situations. A script that gives us the kitchen sink drama of folk attempting the American dream, the tense drama that sometimes has you wondering whether you like that person you loved a minute ago, and some very normal, human days. Then you take the immensely talented Sigourney Weaver, David Strathairn, and Julianne Moore (along with other mentionables such as Richard McMillan and Aunjanue Ellis) to deliver the dialogue, and we already have something worth watching.I could attempt to interpret it, and tell you what it's all about, what it all 'means' but, in essence it's a story about some people dealing with some extraordinary events in their ordinary lives. What we learn, or take away from it is down to the individual watching.The direction, and photography is flawless, with some subtle colour themes running throughout the movie. Greys and pale blues, set with rust and bright orange as the story progresses; fields and concrete, hope and despair. The story is linear, but very rarely the camera cunningly takes us to different times and places. The soundtrack is just fine, and while it, and the film sometimes verge on being a little saccharine (which it manages to avoid in the main), what we see here are some very talented people making a good solid film.A lot of the time what you think is about to happen next, often does. But be ready for a couple of surprises, and even if what happens next is what you suspected would occur, just watch some people acting their socks off! I only found this film because the DVD was on sale for half a dollar, and bought it purely on the strength of Sigourney Weaver and Julianne Moore, who have never let me down. They are a couple of the best actors of their generation - I only have to point you to Snowcake, The Hours, or Magnolia for solid proof of that. Apart from their obvious acting abilities, I particularly applaud their lack of vanity, and dedication to getting things right.If you think you're into good film, and want to see all of them before you die, then you really should watch this one.

There are no special effects, character development is relatively deliberate, and the complete storyline unfolds gradually, much like Lone Star does. Weaver's and Strathairn's characters remind me of the two leads in Limbo - good people who are just barely holding things in their lives together. They are big-city folk who decide to buy a rural dairy farm and work it with their two small girls. A couple of tragedies enter, and their lives are forever changed. The film deals with relationships and the human resiliency that allows us to adapt.CAUTION -- SPOILERS FOLLOW --Things start to unravel when Alice, a grade-school nurse, allows a friend's (Theresa, Julianne Moore) little girl to wander off and drown in their farm pool. The girl actually dies a bit later in the hospital, only kept alive by machines. This happens about the time Alice is going half-crazy dealing with the brats at school, and especially the kid who seems to always be sick, and who once spit out medicine into her face, and she slapped him in angry reaction. Days after the girl dies, Alice is arrested, but for sexual abuse of the little brat at school. Two other children later join with complaints. At first it seems that Alice looks at her imprisonment as a vacation from the daily grind of taking care of her kids and the farm. She asks Howard (husband David Strathairn) to bring her books, she reads a lot, stays to herself, hardly asks about the kids. It starts to look like she may really be guilty, and inside a very sick person. What's really going on, she feels that she has earned her punishment because of letting the girl die, but is not worried because she is innocent and will get out only in a matter of time. Meanwhile, Howard is having a very difficult time on the farm, cannot raise the money to bail Alice out, all the friends and neighbors assume she is guilty and snub them.  He eventually sells the farm, moves to a small apartment, gets Alice out of jail, they hire a good lawyer, they expose the hoax, clear Alice, Thresa become her ally again, and Howard ends up working at the state driver license office. The story ends with Alice, Howard, and their two girls sitting at a round table, and Alice's narration about the 'map of the world. Weaver does a marvelous job, and her character is detestable at times. The DVD is clear but simple, no 5.1 soundtrack, very limited extras, but overall one of the better films that deals with life's difficulties and triumphs. A mature film for mature viewers.

Obviously Weaver is doing the majority of the heavy lifting. She's full of great little nuances. Moore does some powerful acting as a mother who lost her daughter. Strathairn does the most interesting pathetic husband. He does it without any malice. The movie does have a couple of awkward moments that are probably best left out or changed. They build up to a kiss between Howard and Theresa so much that it's annoying. The whole section detracts from the drama turning it into melodrama. The other section is Alice hitting herself.

Her husband is unaware of his surroundings to the point of apparent brain damage. Dude, there is a pot boiling over inches from your head, don't you smile at her all innocently like nothing's amiss, what is wrong with you?Alice is the only responsible person in the house and drags everyone's weight, whether it be her children's abuse or her husband's uselessness, like a beast of burden. To top it off she has a terrible job as a school nurse that she hates as well.All of this is pointing to a nervous breakdown on her part, perhaps a coming-around of her husband and children. This conflict alone would make a solid narrative with a satisfying, if frustrating, structure. Does this happen? No, because...Conflict #2 - Child in Alice's care drowns herselfWow. Um, that came out of nowhere. I see that the reason the kid dies was because A. nasty bitch daughter demanded that Alice leave them alone to find a different bathing suit and Alice like a doormat does as she's told, and B. useless dad was too busy screwing around with the car to see the tiny child wander past him. That is a heap of unnecessary stress on an already stressful story. While this conflict alone would be good as it's own movie - exploring guilt and grief and a broken friendship between two moms - it's pretty spoiled by an already gasping-for-breath stressful setting. Okay, maybe this can be salvaged.Conflict #3 - Alice is wrongly accused of molesting one of the studentsWhat. The. Fudge. Wait, this has nothing to do with the previous two plot lines? Why is this here? ANY of these three conflicts would be enough to cause a nervous breakdown in a normal person and deserve to be explored individually.

"},{"Title":"Intense but Incomplete","Date":"17 February 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This intense film vacillates with mixed results between personal drama and pushing your face into the hellish task of being parents.  Although a good actor and still with a great body, Signourney Weaver is too old for the role.  She also seems too intelligent for the chaos that seems to control her life.  After she is imprisoned, hints are dropped that there is something deeper and darker about her than we know about.  This turns out to be a red herring and an unsatisfying one at that.  One gets the same feeling about Chloe Sevigny's character -- that there's something else about her we need to see, but the filmmakers can't figure out how to show it.  Well constructed individual scenes and committed acting make this film watchable, but, in the end, oddly unfulfilling. "},{"Title":"WEAVER AND MOORE SHINE","Date":"6 October 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"       Guilt is one of those inner demons that affects everyone differently, and often determines someone's future state of being.  Alice Goodwin is consumed with it when her best friend's daughter accidently drowns while in her care.  A MAP OF THE WORLD follows Alice over a period of a year, as she is center stage in two tragedies--the little girl's death and her arrest weeks later involving a seemingly unrelated matter.     Alice is married to Howard (David Strathairn), a man who is living his dreams of owning his own dairy farm.  They are urbanites now living in rural Wisconsin.  There closest friends, Theresa and Dan (Julianne Moore and Ron Lea respectively), are the parents of the deceased girl.  Alice and Howard, along with their two young daughters live a simple but harried life, that comes crashing down after the death of the little girl.     On paper this sounds like a predictable TV movie, but its strength is not in contrived plot twists, and overly dramatic courtroom scenes, but rather in how one ordinary woman handles herself in the midst of tragedies that have engulfed her.     Sigourney Weaver is wonderful as usual in the role of Alice.  She understands how often one has to heal themselves before they can continue the relationships with the ones around them, even their own children.  Her husband David is supportive but is increasingly frustrated as Alice seems to be using her jail time (they are unable to come up with the bail) for her own interesting form of therapy.  In one scenes she refers to her incarceration as getting away to a deserted island.     Other characters are strong in the film.  Louise Fletcher plays David's passive aggressive mother who doesn't approve of Alice's unconventional ways.  In one scene where Alice is trying to work through her own depression, she tells her to quit thinking such dark thoughts.  Arliss Howard as Alice's attorney is also excellent as a lawyer who views  his clients as pawns in a hyperactive game.  Sadly, the viewer realizes that is the only way many attorneys keep up their competitive nature to be successful.     The film, directed by Scott Elliot is not without its faults.  It's pacing is at times too slow, and the people within the community are painted too broadly as uncompromising country folk who are always suspicious of outsiders.  One character mentions she knew Howard was strange when he painted his barn blue.     However, the strengths of this movie far outweigh its minor flaws.  Julianne Moore is terrific as Alice's best friend.  In many films her character would have been strictly consumed with anger at Alice, but here she is much more complex than that, which in turn makes her so much more believable.     A MAP OF THE WORLD is a powerful film about the strengths of family and friends and the capacity to trust one's own instincts in a world that quite possibly no longer believes in you.     As a popular pop song from 1999 remarked, tragedies are rarely able to be seen in advance.  Instead, they blindside you on a Tuesday afternoon.  This film completely understands that sentiment.9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Wonderful, excellent, exhilirating Sigourney is magnificent","Date":"7 February 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I saw this movie just recently and have been waiting too forever.

On this soundtrack, Metheny is accompanied by an unidentified chamber orchestra (percussion, violin, harp, flute, viola, cello, horn, bass, clarinet and the talented Gil Goldstein on organ).Mostly variations on the title track, these melodic interpretations are quite eloquent (as one would come to expect from both Metheny & PMG), but arranged such that they never overtake the scene in which they are scored. Metheny contributes his own brilliant lead acoustic guitars, as well as piano and keyboards, with an overall combined feel of his previous Secret Story and Beyond the Missouri Sky releases.A warm, introspective journey, this set of 28 tunes (6 less than a minute long and another 10 less than 2 minutes) are well-crafted and are worthy for a listen on a Sunday morning with coffee, in front of the fireplace with a nice bottle of wine or a drive in the country, esp. for those in the midwestern US.

Unfortunately, about halfway through the focus shifts from this relationship and turns into predictable melodrama filled with every Oscar baiting trick in the book. Sigourney Weaver has always been a good actress but this role is just shameless pandering.

Its one problem is it suffers from Wim Wenderism. By that I mean it has MANY goals, MANY important subjects, and WANTS to cover them all, IN DEPTH, for as long as it takes &#150; IN ONE FILM - but cannot. Because of time constraints, and an occasional unwillingness to narrow down/focus upon ONE major philosophic issue depicted through one story line, it skips-about faster and faster, as a polished stone travels on top of still, deep waters, trying to touch down on as many places as possible before it sinks. This is a STRONG film, and I own it, but I do think there are, like most of Wender's films, two or three films jammed into one. (And do I think Wender's HAS ever hit it right? Yes. My favorite film of ALL time - the desert island film - is his masterpiece Wings of Desire.)

The first hour or so is well done, but then it becomes another B-movie tear-jerker, so much Hollywood fluff.  A Map Of The World is the story of a married mother of two on a Wisconsin farm who suffers terribly when, while babysitting her best friend's two children, one of them wanders off and accidentally drowns in a pond on their property, after which she is charged with child abuse (in an unrelated incident) on her job as a school nurse and the confluence of events turn her quiet farm life upside down.       I thought Sig Weaver gave a generally good performance as the mom in trouble, considering the script she had to work with, which is mostly banal trash.  David Straithairn is reliably good as usual as the put-upon husband.  I guess Julianne Moore has the best moment in the film, after playing it brave-faced at the death of her daughter, she is found by Weaver in the woods having a private breakdown.  It's a great piece of acting and very touching, but it's only great compared to the rest of the movie.  Straight-up, it's not all that good.        The biggest problem here is the script.  Some of the situations and dialogue are fraudulent, and characters aren't really developed.  Chloe Sevigny plays basically a cardboard cut-out of a sleazy bimbo (she might as well have just had it stamped on her forehead for all the script gives her to do), and in one scene Julianne Moore's husband is overheard in an angry tantrum because Straithairn and his kids were in their house visiting, but then, I wondered, how did he feel about HER going over THERE.  It isn't really explored.   I also didn't get some of what Weaver's character was doing - the let's let Oprah decide speech, or one scene when Straithairn visits her in prison and she's making a lot of rambling small talk and doesn't ask about the kids - the insensitivity seems totally out of character.  I didn't believe it for a second when the black women who were needling her in the cellblock came around at the end, the scene where Straithairn and Moore kiss I saw coming a mile away,  and for the creme de la creme of tawdry Hollywood BS endings, when Moore's character turns up pregnant at the end of the movie, it is the ultimate in cheap, slapdash, feel-good garbage.  Oh, well, drown one baby, make another.  This is the sort of thing that screenwriters love because it provides a neat and happy resolution to everything, when, in fact, there is never a resolution to losing a child.   If you remove Miss Weaver's occasional nudity, this thing could play forever on Lifetime channel.   In spite of some strong efforts by the actors, A Map Of The World is junk, irredeemable junk.  2** out of 4   "},{"Title":"Only one redeeming feature her name is Julianne Moore.","Date":"31 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I really tried so hard to like this film - but in the end I had to concede we did not get on. It turned out to be one of the most disappointing pieces of 'drama' I've seen in a long time. The script is terribly hammy, in fact there are some truly apalling moments (the worst being Sigourney Weaver's declaration 'let's go on Oprah!' - I still can't work out if that was a joke) The acting (with one notable exception) is pretty mediocre, which is not helped by formulaic, humdrum direction and some truly shocking child actors. Why give kids who can't act dialogue? It undermines the dramatic potential of a film. As an aspiring screenwriter, I am constantly told to 'make every scene earn its place in your film' - well, there are countless here that could have been omitted. I have seen better made for TV films. The whole thing seems a terribly overlong excersise in 'how can we pull on the heartstrings of the Academy voters?' Luckily even they chose not to acknowledge it. 'A Map of the World' has, as I said, one redeeming feature the presence of the gorgeous, versatile Julianne Moore. Her compelling scene of emotional breakdown following the death of her child in the woods is, in my opinion, worth the price of the film alone. What a shame that they didn't cast her in the lead role. With mediocre material like this, the only hope of transcending it is with a gifted actress of Julianne's talents - however I fear that even she could not have saved it.   One to avoid - but worth it (just) for Julianne Moore. "},{"Title":"Too long.
