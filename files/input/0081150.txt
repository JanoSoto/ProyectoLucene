Don't you believe it!  This is a great American movie. Director Demme and writer Goldman take a footnote to history -- a contested Howard Hughes will that named Melvin Dummar, a milkman who once loaned him a quarter, as one of his heirs -- and turn that slight material into a wry meditation on the American Dream.  Or more specifically, the thin line that separates the American Dream from pure hell.  Demme has a great eye for people like Dummar, a dreamer whose clock for realizing his dreams is winding down.  The performances are terrific, especially Paul Le Mat as Dummar (whatever happened to Le Mat?) and Mary Steenburgen who won an Oscar for playing his wife.  Jason Robards does one of his patented cameos playing a real life character (his Howard Hughes makes a neat hat trick with his Oscar winning performances as Dashiell Hammett and Ben Bradley.)  Watch for the real-life Melvin Dummar as the counterman in the bus station where Steenburgen makes a sandwich for her daughter.  This is a small but knowing and winning movie. It definitely gets my vote for Milkman of the Month!

Even a quarter century ago on its initial release, the film was largely ignored by audiences despite glowing reviews, Academy Awards, and critics kudos.  However, those who make the effort to seek out this wonderful fable will be rewarded.  Based on a story that may or may not have been true, Melvin and Howard spins the tale of an easy going hard luck kinda guy named Melvin Dummar who gives a lift to an old man he finds asleep in the desert.  The man says that he is Howard Hughes, and, years later, when Hughes dies, Melvin finds a will that has been left on his filling station desk that names him as one of the heirs to the Hughes fortune.  Since we know the ending before the film starts, the pleasures lie in the quirky characters and situations that screenwriter Bo Goldman and a terrific cast have created.  Despite the circus that surrounded the question of the will's validity, Melvin was content just knowing that, during their drive, Howard Hughes had sung a song that Melvin had written.  His evident joy in that simple event was a rare personal quality even in 1980.  There are a lot of other unpretentious, yet memorable, moments in this outstanding film.

Of these, the finest was, beyond a doubt, Melvin and Howard.Based on a twentieth century addition to American folklore( the improbable saga of Howard Hughes and Melvin Dummar), Jonathan Demmes' film tells the story of a chronically unsuccessful Everyman, Melvin Dummar, who claimed to have unknowingly picked up Howard Hughes one night in the Nevada desert, and who also claimed to have been written into Hughes' will. Demme uses these materials to fashion a parable about the American dream and human aspiration.It is funny, superbly acted ( Robards probably deserved a third Oscar, and Mary Steenburgen fully deserved hers), well written, and profoundly human. Melvin  Dummar may not have actually picked up Hughes in the desert, and the will may have been a forgery, but his life story does tell some important truths about the meaning of life.

What is sad in some regards now is the realization upon seeing it again that the era of life portrayed here is now gone from the collective American psyche to some extent. That isn't to say the film is dated per se. It's just that Melvin isn't cynical at all and he doesn't seem to have a hateful bone in his body. He's neither a wimp nor a man of intellect but someone whose basic humanity emanates. What helps the film, too, is the pairing of actors Paul LeMat as Melvin, and Mary Steenburgen as Melvin's wife, Linda -- they are an endearing couple. I attribute the film's memorable tone and spirit to not only the actors (including Jason Robards & some of the supporting cast) -- I like to believe that director, Jonathan Demme, put his stamp on this, too.

Dummar picked up Hughes when he was stranded on the side of a Las Vegas road and gave him a ride to Las Vegas. When Hughes died,he bequeathed money to Dummar as a reward for his good deed. Unfortunately, Hughes' estate and the Nevada courts found Hughes' story too unbelievable to be true and Dummar never got the money. The movie itself is well-intentioned and it truly has interesting characters. An actor I've never heard of before in my life, Paul Le Mat, plays Dummar with an innocent aw shucks attitude that endears him to the audience and strengthens our opinion of him as the rightful heir. He lets himself get easily seduced by an older female customer when he's delivering milk and when the woman who turns out to be his second wife makes suggestive innuendo at him, he says Bonnie, aren't you a Mormon girl? His first wife Linda, who was the focus of my attention on this film based on the fact that the only thing I knew about the film was that it was Mary Steenburgen's Academy-award winning role, was an interesting character underneath the guise of her provocative clothing and desire to be a dancer (be it exotic or tap), she's equally innocent and oblivious to the world around her. Except for the one scene in which Bonnie seduces Howard, she's woefully underdeveloped and there's very little reason to be happy to see her and Howard at the end of the film together. The film wants us to feel that it's Bonnie's struggle as well that the press is hounding her and her husband is under national scrutiny because she's his wife, but because of the way marriages were coming and going in the subculture that Paul lived in and the initial chemistry between Linda and Howard, I was kind of hoping that Bonnie was just a temporary road stop en route back to Linda. Never mind that in REAL LIFE, Howard and Linda didn't get back together, if that was the case, the chemistry or story arc between the two needed to be strengthened up front.Another woefully underdeveloped relationship, which is the key to the story and its title, Melvin and Howard. The story, or the most interesting part of it, was all about Melvin's inheritance of Howard's money, and that only came back in the last 20 minutes of the film as a sort of epilogue to the story of Melvin's unsuccessful marriage to Linda.In short, the film never really knew what it was about A man's failed on-again off-again marriage, an almost complete portrait of a man who would go on to become a footnote in history, or the story of a man's controversial claim to inheritance.

This is what a lot of those 'Working' people that politicians tend to smugly refer to them in the abstract are like, just struggling, trying to get by, a lot of Melvin Dunbarrs out there. And this is an interesting 'nobody/loser' kind of guy, since he picks up an old bum one night who claims to be Howard Hughes, and then doesn't think much of it... until years later when, after the old codger dies, leaves 158 million dollars to him as one of his beneficiaries. Finally some luck floats Poor Melvin's way, but at what cost? The movie actually should be called 'Melvin', but then how does one market that without people thinking it's about a nerd or something? And yet the 'Howard' of the title is a little of a misnomer - rather, Jason Robards playing the famous aviator and mogul, is there only for the introduction at the start, and then (spoiler) isn't really seen again. It's the story of this father and husband who is decent at the former but not so much at the latter, as his wife leaves him for being such a 'loser', but then over the course of the film, after being divorced, comes back to him to remarry and have more kids and try to get by a little better.Paul Le Mat plays Melvin and it's a very good performance, since he is able to look into this character and find what makes him human and relatable just in that first scene alone, where by determination (via the luck that's already happened) gets Mr. Hughes to sing a Christmas song Melvin has 'penned' and is so goofy/giddy about it. There's a joy to him, and this comes through even in the awkward moments between him and his wife played by Mary Steenburgen. She, too, is captivating but in a different way as a mother who may or may not be good to her kids, or her husband, but perhaps she and Melvin are made for each other as she drifts off occasionally into stripping, or trying to get extra money by going on an over-the-top Price-is-Right WTF game show.There is solid, entertaining dramedic attention paid to the relationship they have (until it just gets too much and the split is irrevocable), but it's Melvin's tale that shines through and gives Demme so much to work with. Melvin *should* be a jerk, but so much keeps getting thrown in his way, either by himself with his unfortunate purchases, or how he's treated by an a-hole boss at his work as a milk-man (and the bigger question - will he be Milkman of the Month?) The strategy in Bo Goldman's Oscar winning script is spot-on and reveals itself gradually there is a story here, but it's majorly a character piece, so that by the time the 'twist' arrives about Hughes' fortune and the controversy (based on fact) about this will, we've become invested with this likable lunk-head who is a lot of things but not a liar.It's a wonderful odd-ball duck of a movie, led along by some wacky country music that should work but does, and by Le Mat who finds the correct way to play this character and sticks with it (same with Steenburgen, who has the kind of spirit to make getting totally naked while quitting a stripping job very funny and kind of invigorating for the human spirit). There's real heart here too, so that even when certain scenes are imbued with quirk (i.e. the Vegas wedding scene where everybody kisses everybody else, anonymous witnesses included!) that it feels real in some unmentionable way. Oh, and Robards is great fun for the few minutes he's on screen, especially when he comes back near the very end. It's an unlikely and truthful feel-good movie.

After the media frenzy placed upon Melvin, he is then dragged through court, as he is questioned about his story, and thought of as a liar, and opportunist. But Melvin doesn't really care.

The story line (Melvin picks up Howard, takes him to the Sands, drops him off, and goes on with his life as a milkman, gas station owner/mechanic, etc. until he's handed the will, being called a liar, two wives, etc.) is as Leonard Maltin put it in his book of movie reviews a genuine American fable.

Frankly, his character seemed so dumb and short-sighted I tend to believe the will was real--someone that stupid probably couldn't even spell Hughes--let alone think up such a hoax! I must be pretty dumb, too, sitting through this film and ASSUMING there must be some sort of magical payoff--dream on!

That's what Director Jonathan Demme packed into his little biopic about Melvin Dummar. It's all there the mobile home (trailer), the repo guys, the trashy jobs that Melvin (played by Paul LeMat) can't hold. And it's so believable that he stopped to pee while driving across the Nevada desert and noticed Howard Hughes lying injured on the ground (he'd crashed his motorcycle). He thought Hughes was a bum, and took no notice when he said his name. Eight years later when Hughes died he noticed, and when someone delivered a handwritten will that left him, Melvin, one- sixteenth of the estate, or $165m, he drove over to Salt Lake City and left it in the in tray of the Mormons' head office. Of course the will was declared phony by the Clark County Court, and Melvin was subjected to ridicule. But Demme shows him still confident at the end and hoping against hope that one day he might see some cash. This is a slice of South-Western US life that is still well worth seeing. Look out for it. Only one question whatever happened to Paul LeMat after his big launch in the 1970s?

One night, he picks up an eccentric hitchhiker who claims to be Howard Hughes. The first twenty minutes of the film is based on that night. When he drops him off in Las Vegas which is worth seeing in 1980, he returns to his life in a mobile home with long suffering wife Lynda Dummar (played by Oscar Winner Mary Steenburgen) and his daughter, Darcy, played by Elizabeth Cheshire. They are family on the verge of losing money, home, and in debt. Melvin is a likable guy and perhaps he really did meet Howard Hughes. Despite your basic need for money to pay the bills, Melvin works hard and plays fair. He doesn't kid around with Howard Hughes in the truck, It's possible that Howard Hughes related to a man who picked him up on the road where he could have left him for dead, Melvin even given his last cents to him without giving a second thought. Still an enjoyable film after three decades. Jason Robards should have gotten his third Academy Award for his performance as Howard Hughes.

I am one of those dreamers that believes Melvin because he is so believable in the film. I never knew him personally but Paul Le Mat is a fine actor who had a prominent role in 'American Graffiti,' usually driving a young Shelly DuVall around (to his dismay)in his yellow chopped pick-up truck.I have always adored Mary Steenburgen. When she walked away nude in the strip club, I became excited. I remember Pamela Reed (who portrayed Gordon Cooper's wife in 'The Right Stuff' and Melvin's 2nd wife as well as many other films) and she is also a great actress.So, although the script was weak and had too little of Howard Hughes (Jason Robards) in it, I can understand, because the screen writer and director downplay Dummar's claim, which of course, was thrown out of court.

She normally plays the harried wife in various comedies, but this role is strictly Utah trailer trash, and it is delicious. Her husband, Melvin the Milk Man of the Year can't keep a job, so she goes off to make a living anyway she can, shuffling her ten year old daughter off to Melvin. Melvin divorces her, takes her back and she's off again mostly because Melvin spends like a drunken sailor. Paul LeMat had a number of likable fool roles in the late 70's and early 80's. He's chewing gum and singing cowboy songs while they repo his vehicles. A chance meeting with the legendary Howard Hughes, millionaire in the desert is the plot device that propels this cute little film.Sure, downtrodden folks dream of hitting the lottery or inheriting money from an unknown relative, but it is possible that a desperate man in real life, Melvin Dummar, may have forged himself into Hugh's will, but I doubt it. How did he duplicate Hugh's handwriting? No matter, this slice of life is just that, a little Americana from 1980.

One almost expects to see the old spinning newspapers trick to let us know about major events in the story. And the daughter doesn't appear to age a day, though several years go by in the story. Other characters remain wordless throughout the story...does Steenburgen go to live with her mother? Or just an anonymous, kindly woman?We don't know. So the movie has a distinctly unfinished feel to it. Intentional? Or evidence of a botched or hurried editing job? Maybe the version on DVD has been cut from the original?Nevertheless, Robards, Le Mat and Steenburgen all turn in wonderfully warm and memorable, if sometimes sappy performances. And the characters aren't entirely believable. The biggest example is the character of Melvin. He seems a tad too virtuous and dignified and principled to work himself into such colossal jams. But he's entertaining--and that's what counts.The wry humor is also usually on target--the highlight of the movie for me is the aged marriage witness moaning Ohhhhhhh! with every step--but it does sometimes go over the top, which deflates the movie a bit.Nevertheless, this is one of those movies that leaves you with a good feeling, and disposed to overlook its flaws, instead of too many movies I can name that might pay more attention to continuity and overall finish, but leave you feeling vaguely nauseous.Demme displayed early his penchant here for ironic cameos, this one with the actual Melvin Dummar as a bus depot clerk. Though one imagines that his cameo would have been even more ironic as the judge in the Utah courtroom.

The 80's were dominated by director John Hughes. Maybe that's why more movie fans haven't heard of Melvin and Howard. The story of Howard Hughes contains enough material to make a hundred movies. What stands out here is the story and acting.The character of Melvin is the classic lovable loser type done to perfection. As I watched I was pulling for Melvin to make it. He was a dreamer. I loved every time the daughter bounced back and forth between parents she would yell BYE DAD or BYE MOM. I had no clue Mary Steenburgen was that hot naked in the 80's!!!! She's working in a nude go-go bar then quits. Before she leaves she pulls her clothes off walking out in the buff. Her backside looked magnificent. I recommend this touching heartfelt story.

It's supposed to be a comedy but seeing these main characters live this hard scrabble, trailer trash lifestyle isn't really funny to me. Watching Mary Steenburgen's character leave her husband Melvin to move into some horrible motel room where she's slapped around in front of her young daughter, and then become a stripper in an equally horrible burlesque establishment, isn't something I want to spend the time or mental energy watching. It's bad enough to be stuck in one of these places when you're on a road trip and you need gas, and it's too late to find a decent place to sleep, it's disturbing to see this on film. Then the whole 70s free-sex concept, random sex with this milk man Melvin...the director makes the viewer wait through the entire film for the whole point of the title. While waiting for Howard Hughes to die, all these really depressing things are happening to this character Melvin and none of it makes sense in the grand scheme of things. This film is built like Close Encounters of the Third Kind but it doesn't have the wonder of aliens from outer space to make it interesting. I just felt depressed after watching this entire film.

The rest of the film is rather boring. Ms. Steenburgen, however, lights up the screen. She won an Oscar for this role. I didn't see some of the other nominees for that year, so I can't say if it was the best. I can say, however, that she absolutely shone. (This film also contains her only nude scene.) Brava, Mary! "}]
