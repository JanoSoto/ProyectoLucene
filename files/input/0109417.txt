The premise of the story has been done before in several noir films of the past but Harris brings credibility to his role as a smitten cop. A crack detective who solves crimes with the best of them, Harris is a lonely man who is ripe for the picking by Stowe who is not all as she seems. The sexy brunette ranks right up there with Phyllis Deitrichson and Matty Tyler Walker as the genre's classic femme fatales. The supporting cast is good, among them are Benecio del Toro and Charles Dance in key roles. The music score is soft and sultry, very similar to John Barry's theme in Body Heat.

This film never saw the inside of an UK cinema &#150; it went straight to video on release.  However the plot is a good tangled web of murder, mystery and deceit.  It manages to be twisty despite the fact that this sort of thing has been done many times before.  The plot unfolds late and very quickly, managing to be believable and gripping.The main reason for this is a great performance from Ed Harris.  The feeling of him being sucking into something is written all over his face &#150; and the way he goes from cop in control of all the details into a hunted animal is really good.  Stowe is also really good and the support cast also has quality &#150; whether it be Charles Dance or a young looking Del Toro.Overall this may not break box office records but as a thriller it is twisty, contains plenty of good lines and has a great lead performance from Harris.

She's unhappily married and has photos of her husband (Charles Dance) with another woman. He doesn't know this at the time, and tracks her down. They start seeing one another. When her husband winds up dead, Kyle helps her to cover it up.Though the plot is derivative, this is a classily done film with terrific acting, sensual love scenes between the two leads, an easy pace and beautiful photography. It reminded me a little of Body Heat. The plot won't be hard to figure out, but be prepared for a couple of twists.Ed Harris gives a forceful performance as Kyle, and del Toro is understated as Lamar. When the camera rests on Stowe, she's flawlessly beautiful, and what clothes!

CHINA MOON (thriller, 1994) Homicide Det. Bodine (Ed Harris) is a veteran of the force who knows the ins and outs of every crime scene. He meets Rachel (Madeline Stowe), a beautiful woman whose sensual charms he falls under. They begin a steamy relationship. But then he finds out she's married to an abusive and powerful man. Sensing her infidelity he confronts her, and in an act of self-defense she kills him. She seeks Bodines' help. But will he bring her to justice or help the woman he loves?Critique Nifty little thriller borrows from the film-noir tradition. The solid screenplay by Roy Karlson introduces many elements of the genre. There's the honest cop who falls for the habitual 'femme-fetal', and the violent husband as 'middle-man' who ends up dead. But just when you think things are headed into conventional plotting, there's a twist. Good direction by first-timer John Bailey elicits excellent acting all around. Ed Harris gives another powerhouse performance, Madeline Stowe plays the would-be 'femme fatale' role beautifully, as well as an array of solid supporting actors including Benicio del Toro (who reminded me of James Dean in his younger days). Great ending too.QUOTE Kyle You were just fV@*!ng me weren't you?! I was loving you and you were fV#!ing me!

That said, China Moon is not a total disappointment.If you haven't seen the movie, please stop reading here.There are a few things that indicate that Rachel wanted to use Kyle from the beginning. There are also hints that Lamar, Kyle's detective partner, is into something. How could a good detective like Kyle fall prey to the exchange of the the bullet that is extracted from Rupert Monro's body? The filmmakers take a chance in presenting a half baked pie to the viewers, many of whom are into mysteries, and think the plot will be taken at face value, when in reality, our minds are going in different directions. The fans of this genre solve the puzzle before the movie's conclusion.That said, the movie is easy to watch. Ed Harris, makes a credible Kyle. This actor is one of the best working in movies today, and even if it's not a good picture, Mr. Harris can be counted to give an excellent performance. His detective offers a good character study of a professional man that makes a fatal judgment when he gets involved with Rachel.Madeleine Stowe is a beautiful woman. In this movie she plays Rachel with conviction; her scenes with Ed Harris shows clearly she can hold her own against anyone. Benicio Del Toro's Lamar, as Lamar, offers an interesting performance, something we expect from him as a matter of course. Charles Dance, as the rich husband who likes to fool around, is only seen too short.This is a movie to watch when the weather is bad outside. It will please anyone who doesn't expect too much.

The story is done in an unpretentious but very suspenseful way. Also, like most older noirs, it runs closer to 90 minutes, whereas many neo-noirs run much longer.I don't want to spoil the story, so I'm saying little about it.

The reality, however, is that the plot departs from the conventional Double Indemnity template and ultimately leads to a twist which is both original and unexpected. There's a great deal to enjoy in this story of passion, treachery and murder including a superb performance by Ed Harris, some beautiful visual moments and even some great blues music by the excellent Anson Funderburgh and The Rockets.Kyle Bodine (Ed Harris) is an ace detective who's extremely adept at examining murder scenes, deducing how the crime was committed and then identifying clues about the nature of the perpetrator. He's a decent man who's well respected by his colleagues but he's also lonely and sometimes arrogant. His powers of observation are normally exceptionally strong but he doesn't see what's coming when he meets and then gets seduced by the beautiful and mysterious Rachel Munro (Madeleine Stowe).Rachel is married to a rich banker called Rupert (Charles Dance) who's a serial adulterer and wife beater. During a particularly heated confrontation with her husband, Rachel shoots and kills him in self defence and then persuades Kyle to assist her in disposing of the body and covering up the evidence of what has happened. Kyle carries out these tasks with his usual efficiency but problems arise when the body is discovered and his rookie partner Lamar Dickey (Benicio del Toro) discovers some clues which lead to the finger of suspicion being pointed at Kyle.Ed Harris looks perfectly comfortable in his portrayal of Kyle's unassuming demeanour and is totally believable as he becomes passionate about Rachel and then increasingly desperate as he tries to prove his innocence. Madeleine Stowe shows the despondency which has overtaken Rachel as a consequence of suffering years of abuse in a loveless marriage but at other times it seems that her depression has made her unresponsive and difficult to read. This type of inscrutability is a classic trait of the femme fatale but Rachel doesn't fall unequivocally into that category as she is clearly a more sympathetic character than the conventional noir archetype.Charles Dance is good at conveying just how violent and despicable Rupert is but his attempt at a southern accent is lamentable. Benicio del Toro gives an interesting performance as a detective who initially shows a number of significant deficiencies in his range of abilities but then later in the story surprisingly seems to acquire a much better grasp of the skills needed to investigate a homicide.The visual style of this movie with its beautiful settings and wonderful shots of the lake at night contributes strongly to the overall mood and is a great credit to the work of cinematographer Willy Kurant.

And the similarity ends there the Kasdan film is a masterpiece, where  China Moon  has not the halting sultriness of the 'Body Heat ' atmosphere, nor its wonderful photography and haunting musical score, and has indeed for  sole asset its very good ( but not better than 'Body Heat's ) cast.'China Moon's main defect is its full-of-holes plot with the photos of her philandering husband taken by del Toro, and the testimony of two cops  against Dance for attacking his wife, Stowe could have got a very very juicy divorce.. O.K. she wants all the money. But  setting-up  Ed Harris as the fall guy is an unusually tricky business  among others, it demands first that del Toro steals from Harris his .38 police gun and replace it by an other .38;  it requires later that del Toro has in hand the 9mm murder bullet before Ed Harris does, and exchange it UNNOTICED against a .38 one fired previously from the Harris gun and sand -ingrained ( ! ), which cannot but rouse Harris's suspicion ( and he is a very good cop ); Harris could also have agreed to come clean when so offered. The plot  does not explain that anonymous phones calls attract attention on Harris as the 'guilty' person because the corpse must be found in order that Stowe gets her money. And at the very end,when Harris exposes del Toro, the police is called by a witness and  arrives ten seconds later ( !! ), at the very time when Ed Harris goes out, a gun in hand, and is killed without warning shots.***** but if you do not look too closely at such errors and holes, you can enjoy the acting of the four above-mentioned players,... and Madeleine Stowe's extraordinary beauty.

Its elements of noir are not forced upon you in the forefront making it the most optimal way to execute noirs whereas the technique is not stealing away from the show. The relationship between Detective Kyle Bodine and Rachel Munro is the main focus of the movie. In China Moon, Detective Bodine has his life in relative order until he's caught up in a steamy love affair with the provocative Rachel Munro which soon takes a turn for the worse when one night Rachel shoots and kills her violent husband. Kyle helps Rachel hide the body assisting her cover up the crime. They wish to get away with it but Bodine's partner, Lamar Dickey, is more clever than one might suspect and he's closing in on the case. Very strong actors Madeleine Stowe and Ed Harris make this movie with very strong performances. Ed Harris is all-around great as Kyle Bodine. Harris is about one of the fifteen best male actors of all-time which is good enough for second best in this film. Madeleine Stowe is infinitely desirable as Munro. Stowe communicates effectively poignant emotions acting so effortlessly, and smooth. Madeleine's definitely one of my most favorite actresses. She's to die for. Benicio Del Toro is Dickey and unassuming as a good cop just doing his job. Del Toro plays third wheel in China Moon with just as an extraordinarily acting ability as Stowe and Harris. Harris and Stowe share great chemistry, although they do not appear compatible, more a forbidden passion attraction which is more suitably appropriate for the film. China Moon is a seductive suspense, romantic thriller. It's not an action movie. The story unravels terrifically. China Moon is an easy viewing, easily attachable. I recommend getting lost in China Moon for more than an hour, an hour and thirty nine minutes if you've got the time.

Many make sense, in regard to the storyline. Recent examples -- The Majestic, Life As A House, Monsters Ball.  But the title of this film came from a comment made at night, during a full moon, My mama called that a China Moon, because it looks like a big china plate. Catching title, but has absolutely nothing to do with the story.SPOILERS -- Ed Harris is a by-the-book detective, a homicide investigator. Early on we know he will be sucked into a plot by Madeline Stowe to get rid of her husband (we learn near the end she stands to gain $12million), so we spend most of the film trying to figure out her tricks. We see early that her husband is having an affair. We finally find out that Harris's sidekick, played by Benicio DelToro, is in on the plot. He switches guns, fires bullets into the sand to get slugs, plants Harris' bullets to make him look guilty.There are a few inventive items. After Stowe shoots her husband in self defense, and she asks Harris to help conceal the incident by getting rid of his body in a lake, he throws her 9mm gun onto the top of a big rig truck so it will end up some where distant and not be found. DelToro figures out which lake the body is in by noting the odometer reading and finding a lake half that distance away. But the shoot-out at the end didn't seem to fit, but was I guess a convenient way to bring closure to the characters. However, since Stowe shoots DelToro as she watches Harris die, are we to suppose she was sent to jail for a long time?  Probably not, she could afford a good lawyer and probably get probation based on mental anguish.Not a waste of time, but Ed Harris must do some incredibly stupid things in the name of love to get this movie to come to its intended conclusion. China Moon will not go down in movie history as one of the better films.

This film is a great example of the classic Film Noir plot Murder and conspiracy to defraud an insurance company. Not unlike the previous films Body Heat (Deluxe Edition) (1981) and The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 and 1981) or even Double Indemnity(1944), China Moon never ceases to surprise us with plot twists. The difference is that Ed Harris is a murder detective but doesn't know what he's up against. He's put in the position to cover up a murder that he didn't commit but would ultimately implicate him. But the killer isn't telling him everything...Stowe is a great femme Fatale in this early 90's film starring Benicio Del Toro and Wayne Shorter. In a city where the majority of city blocks are occupied by industrial sectors of DeDonde Inc., conspiracies are frequently started for various reasons. In a town where cops help criminals and criminals help cops, Ed Harris is up against a web of deceit and confusion. He's the best man for the job, but is the job designed to frame him for MURDER? Madeline Stowe isn't telling him everything, and his detective partner Del Toro may have some cards up his sleeve as well.Shorter is a local bar owner who sees it all, trying to help Harris before it's too late without letting Del Toro know the score, not to mention Stowe. With the help of a local inventor-gone-mad, Shorter is given a device that will help Ed Harris freeze time and therefore understand why all evidence points to him as the killer. (The device was intended for DeDonde Inc.) But Shorter is also double-crossed when MICHAELmATICIAN uses the device against him at the bar (in an effort to win a game of pool). Will Harris beat the rap? Will Shorter prove that it was Stowe? China Moon is real, as is the Michrotron. MICHAELmATICIAN states that we must learn to see the Michrotron at once. China Moon is also recommended.2.342 (Jeremy Shingles) "},{"Title":"slow first half in functional thriller","Date":"19 May 2015","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Romance, Thriller","Review":" Kyle Bodine (Ed Harris) is the lead detective teaching less experienced Lamar Dickey (Benicio del Toro). Kyle is taken with Rachel Munro (Madeleine Stowe). She had hired a private eye to take pictures of her wealthy banker husband Rupert Munro (Charles Dance) cheating. Rachel buys a gun and starts a romance with Kyle. Kyle and Lamar are called in on a domestic abuse at the Munros. While Kyle is helping her leave her abusive husband, she shoots him in self-defense. She fears the perception of her unregistered gun and no witnesses. She convinces Kyle to help her cover up the killing. Kyle and Lamar investigate the missing Monro. Lamar finds surprising new evidences seeming to point to Kyle.This is very much by the book hard-boiled thriller. The movie moves a bit too slowly for the first half. It needs to start with Kyle and Rachel already in a heated romance. There's no need to waste time developing the chemistry. These are great actors able to sell an already heated romance. They need to get to the killing faster. The tension is all in the cover-up. It's basically a 40 minute setup. This is a bit slow and the tension is not high until the second half. However it has great actors and they keep the movie going.

Ed Harris when he had some hair, Benicio before his eyebags got too dark and Madeleine Stowe at her most beautiful. The camera spends a lot of screen time focussing on moonlight shots of her lovely face.The story itself is predictable and familiar but that's okay. Beautiful woman married to brutish wealthy man who cheats on her (why would someone cheat on such a beautiful wife?). A cop falls in love with her and guess what bang bang the husband is dead. The conclusion feels a bit cheap and weak and that is disappointing.Despite its flaws I think it's worth a watch for the actors just don't expect a great story.

Just when you think you've got this movie figured out, it yanks the rug out from under you and it's a whole new storyline.This is an outrageously unlikely but entertaining thriller that pays homage to Body Heat in ways that kept me consistently suspicious of the Madeleine Stowe character. How wrong I turned out to be. And she keeps on surprising up to the film's final frame. Ed Harris does a great job of playing the fall guy; a kind of double agent -- criminally tampering police detective probing the murder to which he is an accomplice. Bravo, Ed, and I loved the red hair.Plaudits, too, to Benecio del Toro as a schemer of almost Shakespearean proportions. He's excellent as a Jekyll-Hyde-like wet-behind-the-ears rookie and criminal mastermind.If you like movies that keep you guessing, take a look this one at the next full moon... "},{"Title":"Follow the Template","Date":"17 February 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Romance, Thriller","Review":"  The film classic `Double Indemnity' has become a template for dozens of movies.  A woman is involved in an abusive and/or loveless marriage.  She meets a man, and they begin to have an affair.  She tells him how miserable she is in the marriage, and he agrees to help her murder her husband.  The man believes he is skilled enough to cover up the crime.  But then the cover-up begins to unravel.  Part of the joy of watching films of this genre is trying to predict how things are going to go wrong, and whether the wife (who almost always stands to inherit a fortune after her husband dies) will eventually betray her lover.  `China Moon' follows this formula except for two deviations.  The wife (played by Madeleine Stowe) alone kills the husband (Charles Dance, in another example of a British actor trying to use a Southern accent, and sounding ridiculous).  The lover (a detective played by the always good Ed Harris) doesn't kill the husband, but he does agree to cover up the crime.  But more importantly there is a plot twist toward the end of the film that is unbelievable and sends the film off in the wrong direction.The movie would have been better served if it had followed the template and instead played off the a relationship between Harris and his partner, played by Benicio Del Toro.  Early in the film the veteran Harris chastises his young partner for not being observant.  A better plot line would have been for Del Toro to prove his partner wrong.

Ed Harris was just plain wonderful. While I don't require perfect realism or logic and understand the noir conventions that rely on twists and coincidences,this movie is hurt by inconsistencies that happen because of inconsistent application of intelligence. Kyle is smart and not a noir chump. He isn't brought down by accidents or because he is just too dim to figure things out. Kyle just acts dumb and/or unobservant sometimes and that is hard to buy into. Had the script relied on something other than Kyle's uneven smarts, this could easily have rated an 8 or 9 just on the strength of Ed Harris' eye contact with Ms. Stowe.

I just checked the credits of China Moon's screenwriter and my fears have been confirmed...prior to this, two credits, both TV. That's about the caliber of this by-the-numbers Neo-noir thriller that's both not very thrilling and not very noir.Noir needs to be moody, atmospheric, and contain dialog with a snap and particular rhythm. China Moon's script appears to have been attempted after a cursory browsing of Noir for Dummies. Yes, there's snappy patter...unfortunately it's all trite done-to-death snappy patter. There's virtually not one line I couldn't predict. When Harris and Stowe first meet, the exchange is wooden and you can sense the actors struggling futilely to make something original out of it.Ed Harris gives everyone his smoldering 500-yard stare but it's nothing he hasn't offered before in much better films. Stowe and he don't seem to connect on virtually any level, but with a script this bad there's nothing to draw sparks from. Benecio DelToro looks bored out of his mind, Pruitt Taylor Vince is completely wasted. This movie could have benefited from a more unknown, fresher cast. Sending these vets into this junior high knock-off production is a little like hiring Larry Olivier to star in your kid's school pageant.Virtually nothing in the plot comes as a surprise. You find yourself thinking surely it's not this simple only to be woefully disappointed. The hook-line here --- Sooner or later they all f*** up --- is so stale and stupid it's cringe-worthy. And the lame attempt at a tragic ending makes it more than mock-worthy....you have to have substantial investment in characters for a tragedy of this scale to really pay off. There's none of that here.Yeah, sooner or later.... In this case, for screenwriter Roy Carlson....MUCH sooner.

Was that line ever true. Harris begins an affair with Stowe, who is in an abusive marriage with a very effective Charles Dance, who sports a southern drawl amid his misery.When Stowe shoots Dance in self-defense, Harris willingly becomes an accessory by destroying the clues. It seems like the perfect crime is committed until Harris's assistant, a very good Benecio Del Toro, shows that he is much more capable than Harris ever thought. In fact, he is a little too smart.It's at this point that the movie begins to sag. The ironic ending is a bit too much to swallow.

Benicio Del Toro isn't to be overlooked either, but he was not yet developed into the great performer he was in TRAFFIC.As others have indicated, this isn't a truly bad film and if one overlooks the flaws and just enjoys the performances, it's definitely worth watching Alert viewers won't be surprised by twists in the plot, but the ride is still good enough for a rental.

In some ways it's better, but in most it's not as good. Body Heat had several things going for it that China Moon does not. Its sultry score was distinctive. This score is generically blue. So's the photography. In Body Heat, the images actually looked hot. In the café scenes you could almost smell the humidity and the fat molecules hanging in the air, although in fact they were probably shot through a Vaseline-coated lens. Here, instead of heat, we get a harsh icy blue tint to many of the scenes. When we are out of doors, in the rain and mud, under the blue lights, it seems positively chilly. (And the director was a photographer himself!) The acting in both films is mixed. Kathleen Turner sounds breathless but doesn't exude a particularly high level of heat energy, whereas Bill Hurt is excellent as a dumb lawyer. Ed Harris here is less inventive that Hurt but does a solid job. As for Madeleine Stowe. It isn't easy to measure physical beauty accurately. Lately psychologists have been fiddling around with various mathematical ratios based on the idea that facial symmetry per se is attractive, but the results so far have been mostly good for laughs. A more reliable, if rougher, way to get at it is to filter one person's appearance through someone else's perception of it. Build an ordinal scale of ranks. You can get a pretty good idea of how attractive a face looks if you ask 100 members of the opposite sex to rank it from one to ten, ten being highest. Stowe, I should think, would come out pretty high on such a scale, although symmetry would have absolutely nothing to do with it, anymore than it would with Nastassja Kinsky or Gwyneth Paltrow. Not a bit of it. Stowe's anthracite irises are slightly crossed under their long black lashes, and her lips are appealingly askew. She may not be symmetrical, but man she could play a Franklin stove and get away with it.The plot, such as it is, isn't as filled with the kind of intrigue and uncertainties of the original model. It has a certain familiar mechanical quality to it. Much more stuff about switched and hidden guns. And it ends in a kind of tragic shootout, instead of a full-throated blast of irony. It's also a bit hard to follow, in a way the original was not. Until the shooting of Stowe's husband, I could understand all of it. Stowe genuinely loved Harris. After that, when the frame begins to take shape, I became confused about when the sinister plot was planned and hatched. And why and when did Stowe's emotion toggle from love to exploitation? The story no longer made sense, having lost its continuity with the first half. And, surprisingly, it lacks evocative touches and local color. No tinkling wind chimes. No humor to speak of. And Florida? It could as easily have been Nebraska. "}]
