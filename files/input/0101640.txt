[{"Title":"Brutal politics in a marriage of concubines","Date":"12 February 2001","Score":"75 out of 85 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" (Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.)Raise the Red Lantern is one of the most extraordinarily beautiful movies I have ever seen. The sets are exquisite tableaux carefully arranged, decorated and framed, and then shot from an attractive angle. The scene as they drag the third mistress, kicking and screaming to the tower of death, with the snow falling so peacefully onto the rooftops was chilling in its effect. The startling blaze of color, light and detail within the houses set against the drab simplicity of the courtyards, continually provided a contrast between life within the protection and at the favor of the master, and life without. This dichotomy is symbolized in the vibrant red lamps and the somber blue hue of the lamps when they are covered. In this manner, the mistresses are controlled. I was also struck by the sonorous beauty of the accompanying Chinese music.But more compelling than the beauty of the film is the story Director Zhang Yimou tells, a tale of paternity and imperious privilege set in early twentieth century China. He begins with the newly arrived fourth mistress, 19-year-old Songlian, a university student who, because of the death of her father, is forced to quit school. She chooses to marry a man of wealth. She is warned by her stepmother that she will be a concubine. She replies, isn't that our fate? Her cynicism and then her robust energy in seeking her ascendancy over the other sisters engages us and we identify with her struggle.What is extraordinary about Zhang's direction is how easily and naturally the personalities of the characters are revealed. The first mistress (big sister) is too old to be of any sexual interest to the master, yet she is the mother of the eldest son. The second mistress, who has given the master only a daughter, still dreams of having a son. Her devious schemes and plots are hidden by smiles and fake good will toward her sisters. The third mistress, an opera singer still vibrant and beautiful (in a fascinating performance by the intriguing Caifei He), uses her allure in vying for the master's attention. Songlian, in spite of herself, finds herself caught up in the competition with the others.Gong Li, who plays Songlian, is very beautiful with a strength of character that one quite naturally admires. She has the gift, as does, for example, Julia Roberts, of being able to express a wide range of emotion with just a glance of her very expressive face.Serving as a foil to the mistresses, and perhaps as the most poignant victim of the concubine system, is the servant girl Yan'er, played with a compelling veracity by Kong Lin. She is occasionally (how shall I say this for Amazon?) touched, to use Songlian's term, by the master, and so she dreamed of being the fourth mistress. But when the fourth mistress arrives, her dreams are shattered, and in her jealousy she hates Songlian and plots against her. One of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when Songlian, thinking Yan'er has stolen her flute, forces open the servant girl's room and finds it flooded with.... Well, you should see.Note well that the master is only hazily observed. He is a personage, a man of wealth. That is enough to know about him. He is as interchangeable as the harem masters on a beach of elephant seals. But because he has wealth, he can engage concubines who must compete with one another through him to find their station in life. One gets a sense of what it might be like in the harem system practiced by gorillas and the sheiks and warlords of old. One pleases the master not because one loves the master (although one does of course because humans tend to love their masters) but because in pleasing the master one rises above the others. Thus the triumphant call, Light the lanterns in the third house!Most people no doubt lament the life of the mistresses. Yet women in poor places may wish such a life upon themselves. But concubines are just prostitutes, really, one might say, trapped by a system of male privilege. But I would remind those who see only that, that for every wife the master has, that is one wife another man will not have. The system does NOT favor males. It favors wealth and privilege. In such a system there are many men without wives, fomenting unrest, which is why modern states forbid polygamy.What does a man do with the capital he accumulates or inherits? If the system allows, he spends it on women and the assurance of his paternity. And why is that possible? Because many women--Songlian is our example--would rather be the fourth wife of a rich man than the first and only wife of a poor man. Many women would rather be used by a man of wealth than rule the household of a nerd. This is the way humans are, and any sexist interpretation of this movie misses this truth.The real horror depicted here, though, is in the brutality used to maintain the system, not in the polygamy itself. The women who follow the rules and beget the master's children, especially if they are sons, enjoy a pampered and secure existence Those who do not are dealt with severely, branded as mad, or even murdered. Note the similar experience of the wives of Henry VIII, for example, within the English system of serial monogamy. This is a great movie, like a timeless novel fully realized, directed by a visual genius, from a script of great psychological power. Don't miss this one. It's one of the best ever made.

The story we see is a visual treat but overlays a much deeper story of China in myriad aspects. Perhaps you are unaware that films and books of the period had to tread lightly on topics that were not merely taboo but could result in danger for all connected. Thus, a slight symbolic representation often took place. Sort of poetic shorthand. Not unlike Chinese art that may seem to be about the season of autumn but is actually about death or change or loss. Nevertheless, any film must stand on its own regardless of the background. This film includes acting scenes that are incredibly forceful and still so gentle. The photography, costumes, sound and music blend into a cinematic work of art. I found the character completely believable, a woman bound in a tradition from which she found no escape except death or madness. And for those who sneer at the opera singer, imagine how the music you enjoy would sound to someone who has a completely different background. Please accept cultural diversity and let your mind and heart be enlarged!

I don't remember when I've seen another film in which every single role was played to perfection.  (Incidentally, this wonderfully believable acting seems to occur in at least some, if not most, of the roles in every Chinese movie I see, from the mainland or otherwise.)The story is one of classical simplicity, in in large part presented with the same classical, clear quality.  The interplay of passion, jealousy, and revenge is reminiscent of Shakespeare, but, for me, more entertaining--if it's proper to speak of such ultimately somber and even horrifying subject matter as entertainment.I unhesitatingly gave a vote of ten, and noticed that a full 33% of voters so far had done the same--very unusual.  When Roger Ebert called Raise the Red Lantern breathtakingly beautiful, he wasn't exaggerating.  But beyond its beauty, its moral seriousness, the fact that not for a moment is it dumbed down in the regrettable Hollywood fashion, its superb acting, and its almost unbelievably perfect pacing, make it a rare, rare experience.Red Sorghum, the only other Zhang Yimou film I've seen so far, I found somewhat propagandistic but gripping and visually stunning (even more so than Raise the Red Lantern.)  I will be making an effort to see more of this director's fairly extensive body of work.  It's a shame major theater chains don't schedule movies of this caliber instead of the torrent of commercialized Hollywood trash they foist on the public, which, alas, seems only too eager to wallow in more and more of it.

I have to say that I couldn't live without it, effectively anyway. The political criticisms tear at the spine of the film and the beauty of it in such an intimate setting is outstanding. The use of such a rich, three dimensional setting defies what we have been taught by the mainstream as being beautiful and sets a standard on a budget that I would love to be aware of, that all Hollywood movies should aspire to. It shows us that film, real film that is, does not need $100 million to look good, rather the combination of a haunting setting in the middle of vastness and the equally haunting beauty of it's star, Gong Li, but at it's heart the house itself resembles a claustrophobic pot, boiling over the surface.This is in my opinion, Zhang Yimou's greatest film, it is a triumph in film form and narrative. The haunting sounds of flutes, a significant visual and audio element that has a mythical quality due to it's importance to Songlian and becomes an unattainable item of the gods when it is removed from existence when it is burned, becoming a tragic reminder on the attempts to vanquish the personalities of not only Songlian but all of the concubines. It's slow burning nature may repel the masses but anyone who can get a copy, do so without fail, you will never regret it. I cannot stress the importance of this film, we may see it as a study on the oppression of women in China, but this is universal, we westerners once did the same thing not too long ago.For me the cinematography is what sells the film, it is the best I have ever seen and ever will. If there is ever a film to promote the use of the three strip technicolour process once again, this is it. Long after you have finished your post film analysis, the light from the red lanterns will still be searing in your eyes.

The story is shown through the eyes of a young college-dropout played by Gong Li. Family misfortune has forced her into concubinage as the fourth mistress of the Chinese lord. A headstrong woman, her relationship with the lord's household, especially the other three mistresses, form the basis of the story. But it's telling is as important as the story itself.

Raise The Red Lantern is one of the only Chinese movies I've seen, but I'll definitely admit that it's unusual to see a film this stylistically masterful come out of Hollywood (although it can happen -- The Thin Red Line, for example). A lot of what makes this film work is Zhang Yimou's outstanding directorial style; his use of color against bleak background is especially effective. It's his hypnotic visuals that keep you interested throughout the slow progression of the story. And the amazing acting by most of the performers doesn't hurt, either; everything feels completely real.I think of this as one of those movies that you aren't supposed to enjoy; it shocks you, and leaves you just as disturbed as, considering the subject matter, you should be. The miserable story of Yan'er, the servant girl, is especially painful to watch, and the same goes for the unfolding of the last few scenes. But I think the fact that I was so unsettled by this movie probably just goes to show how well it gets its points across. And along with the remarkable acting and directing, that's definitely something to be respected.

Gong Li, the director's longtime muse, delivers a performance nearly unsurpassed by anyone, male or female, in the 1990s (and many other decades, as well).  Her opening close-up is an indelible image of sorrow and resignation capable of drawing tears out of a statue.

When she joins the household of the Master, with his 3 other wives and numerous servants, she is little prepared for the infinite under-currents and jealousies of the wives and the continuous baiting of the servants.  She is put in a house of her own off the main courtyard of the rambling estate, a vast maze of connected buildings.  But the wives are not quite out of earshot of each other, and what can be overheard feeds the hate among them.  When the Master has chosen the wife he wishes to spend the night with, huge red lanterns are lit and hung around the outside and inside of the house of that wife and she is given a foot massage with small weighted silver hammers whose castanet-like sounds echo through the entire complex, and they serve as an overt display to the others that they were not good enough on that day to win his affections and must try harder the next day.  As each jockeys for the Master's attention, Songlian is at first expertly played against the other women but eventually learns to scheme and conspire as well as they.  She is never sure exactly which of the other wives is her enemy or her friend, and the situation seems to change daily.  After she makes a grand power play that fails, in part because of a jealous young female servant, she is effectively in exile for a time.  However, a terrible, centuries-old custom will unfold in one of the topmost, locked rooms of the complex during her exile, and Songlian eventually discovers the dreadful secret.

I have several films that I reserve for good days because I know they will reward. Its a sort of celebration that will send me into rich dreams, annotating my life.This has two known qualities that you, dear reader, can expect without knowing anything about the film itself.First, you will know that this is a woman directed by someone deeply in love with her. This doesn't always produce great films, but when the director is inherently cinematic, it often evokes something deep in the viewer. There is nothing in the world like looking on the face &#151; the person &#151; you are centered on. A million subtle decisions are made in each scene, summing to an effect that cannot be missed. If this had poor narrative qualities (and some of their films did) it would still have this quality of seeing into a soulmate deeply enough to be able to animate the skin.Its quite interesting when you consider the woman. If you see her outside of film, or in films made by ordinary eyes, she is quite ordinary. She has an atypical Chinese body busty and widehipped. She is poised but doesn't have the neck or cheekboned face of other Asian women. Only under this man's eye is she a goddess. You can see this in the very first shot.The second thing you can count on is the architectural anchoring of the thing. This man knows how to use space. He uses it in the cinematic narrative, for example, if you replay the shots where the house of death is shown, and then the last encounter with it... And if you understand why the decisions about handling distance and surfaces were made they way they were, you will have entered a zone where from now on you will not be able to reason without reasoning with place.But there are other handlings of space As with some of his other films, the building is a character. Its the noir narrator who sets the rules &#151; often arbitrary &#151; under which all characters are bound to operate, and which drives the narrative. Its a particularly western notion, this, and has gotten our hero in trouble, even banned. This part is following Welles and Kubrick. But he goes further than either of them with this notion that the light both has agency of its own (it selects which of the four wives gets a foot massage and sex) and is a part of the fabric of the buildings. The redness changes the spaces it occupies, bringing intrigue with the sex, desire for several things. Its quite layered, what is going on. These lanterns are the real master; in fact the person who inhabits the master's body is hardly even there. We never see his face.Because of the extensive use of hard planes and selfish light, there aren't many fabric effects here, as we'll see elsewhere.I am tempted to designate this as one of my two allowed must see before you die films of 1991. But I'm in too good a mood to make such a serious decision.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

The beautifully framed shots have a lingering, almost hypnotic quality as the household travels through the seasons in an endless journey that is guided by ancestor worship, protocol and doing the right thing even when it is bitterly, disastrously wrong. The pathos is etched in stark reality upon the face and graceful movements of Li Gong, who takes the lead as Songlian, the 'Fourth Wife'. One of the most emotive faces upon the cinema screen, she delivers an egg-shell-fine performance that is at the same time hardy, robust and wise.The audience never gets to know the human face behind the husband. Maybe there is no face, no humanity there. It matters little, because this is indeed the only face his four wives and his carefully ordered household ever see. He is indeed, their captor, not suitor. The ageing male housekeeper maintains the order of the house, and in his hands, the raising, lowering and covering of the red lanterns becomes a symbol that stains the entire film red.This picture needs to be understood to be appreciated. I can imagine that some will be frustrated by the apparent lack of action, the apparent lack of characterisation. But this is indeed the film's strength. We share in the pain and frustration of everything always being as it has been, yet nothing ever being really as it seems at all. The characters take on the mask-like appearance of ghosts, except that right in the middle of it all, living and breathing human beings are caught, stripped of their will, and subjugated beautifully; their sterile riches suffocating them.In the VHS version I saw, the cover notes were very poorly written and misleading, hinting at a particular love interest that (fortunately, I can say) is not in the film, yet ignoring the symphony of clashing hearts and minds that are central to the wonderfully woven plot. If you have the same 1995 PAL UK widescreen release version that I viewed, my advice is read the IMDb summary on the film and don't take the sleeve notes too seriously.Everything about this picture is superb. It is a two hour poem of finely balanced regret and retribution. Be fortified and to really imbibe this at full strength, let the narrative disturb and move you. Let the pathos of the images wash over you, and be - just a little, perhaps - changed forever.

She drops out of school and becomes the concubine of Master Chen (Jingwu Ma) a wealthy merchant, who welcomes her into his household, lavishing her with treatment more luxurious than any she has known. Yet luxury, as always, comes with a price, and the three other mistresses in the master's house (Caifei He, Cuifen Cao, and Jin Shuyuan) are less than enthusiastic about the sudden presence of an attractive young rival. To make matters worse, Chen decides, on a daily basis, which of his four concubines will receive his nocturnal patronage. The woman he settles on receives all the services the house has to offer, and the women who come up short are summarily forgotten. Consequently, the women must jockey for position, all vying for the privilege of the titular lanterns, lit outside the house of whatever woman is lucky enough to receive the master's company.Raise the Red Lantern &#150; a genuine masterpiece &#150; bears the fruit of the planet's last three-strip Technicolor lab, located in Shanghai, and you can't so much as glance at the screen without noticing the difference. Lanterns dangle from the eves of the buildings and burn with lavish brilliance. The brightly clad protagonists leap from the backdrop of drab-colored stones. The lights of the houses glisten in the intermittent blizzards of oncoming winter. Every single frame in the entire movie is enough to make the mouth water, yet for all its deliciousness, it's never the beauty of what we're looking at that holds our attention so much as the ambiguity of that which remains off-screen. We never see the entrance to Master Chen's massive, sprawling compound, nor do we get a clear idea of its size, its layout, or its exact population. It appears to have no limits, expanding outward to infinity, encompassing all of China. Becoming China. Master Chen, for his part, is something of an enigma. At no point in the film do we get a clear look at his face. He's more concept than creature, inseparable from the oppressive rules of his house, from the dictums of tradition, from Chinese society at large.For China, the 1920s was a time of collision, between ancient traditions and the rumbling of modernity, between entrenched patriarchy and the almost teasing suggestion that women might begin taking stock in their fortunes. The protagonists of Lantern, and Songlian in particular, bear the brunt of this clash. Caught between the promise of freedom and the reality of servitude, they can only find power in the privileges of the house, and yet the more they exploit these privileges, the more the privileges control them.Yimou goes to great lengths to remind us of this fact, jerking us back and forth between long shots and close-ups, from beginning to end. Long shots create an almost Kubrickean sense of emptiness, dwelling on vast, impersonal spaces in which characters seem to vanish against their will. Close-ups zero in on all the incidental details that make up the daily routine &#150; the foot massages and the preparation of the afternoon meals &#150; all facets of the unassailable dead weight of tradition. Editing the film in this way makes us feel like there's no relief from the prison, regardless of our perspective, regardless of where we're at in relation to the subject at hand. Even the sound effects begin to feel like wardens. The clack of the foot massage, the eerie rush of the lanterns getting blown out in the morning, the periodic voice of the compound crier, announcing where the lanterns are to be lit, and who will receive the privileges that go with it . . . all of it creates an incessant sense of continuum. An unbroken cycle. A pursuer that never gets tired.I could go on and on with my praise, but doing so would be insult to the strength of Yimou's storytelling. Watch it, love it, and ask yourself why the devil they don't make movies like this all the time.

She didn't want to move into it After the death of her father she was sold to the rich man in order to ease the financial worries of her stepmother. Therefore she can't lead a self-determined life and continue her student's career, as she had intended.Unlike the other women, who adapt to the prevailing condition and who manage to give to their lives a certain passion or meaning by their continual intrigues and their wooing the master's favor, Songlian soon becomes a silent and introverted rebel. The mourning she shows after her master has deliberately destroyed the flute she once received as a present from her father reveals an obstinate clinging to a happier past. A simulated pregnancy, detected by the family doctor, eventually leads to a break-up with the old patriarch, who feels deceived and dishonored.But Songlian's conduct only leads to ostracism and isolation, not to liberation.

Now she has no other choice than to escape into madness - quite a radical way to cut herself off from the life that surrounds her.

A movie is yet to make the same impression on me. Yes, movies exist that cause frightening images every time you close your eyes, but they're mainly either based on gruesome scenes of blood and torture or involve ghosts and other somewhat fictional characters. Well, the director of Raise the Red Lantern required neither, the work, in my opinion, of a great artist and scholar of humankind and the human mind. From what we mainly know, only ghosts haunt the human world but what if we were to imagine that death is not necessary, and that instead our own selves can haunt the present even alive. What if through human suffering, rivalry, jealousy and the imprisonment of the mind we can destroy our souls and spirits. And what if even worse, it is not other ghosts or evil spirits that cause this, but our fellow human beings. I believe this is the reason why Raise the Red Lantern finds a small place deep inside its' viewers it speaks of the horrifying effects of humankind that each one of us can be affected by &#150; of death during life. Songlian, only nineteen years of age, used to attend a University in China in the 1920's, all until her fate took a fatal turn leaving her in the mansion of a wealthy man, never to know the outside world again. This mansion does bring its luxuries foot massages, a private room, your own faithful servant and somewhat of a husband - all until your servant becomes jealous of you, you rival with the Master's three other mistresses, and possibly countless others to come, and best of all, most of these luxuries are only provided so that you could better entertain and care for the Master, including bearing children for him. Once the women's' dreams are lost, what remains? - a need for passion and attention is something that each of the women rival for, and which some would be willing to do anything for, whether or not it be humane. Jealousy is strong and deception all the more so; the characters' lives are all intertwined and every action can cause a chain reaction, leading to the degradation of the human spirit and mind. What amazed me most about the director's work is the use of color to depict emotion and the techniques used to create tension, fear, struggle and a distinct message and point of view without ever having to show us the crime being committed. Every season throughout the story and every character, personality and emotion is linked to color. The various use of color tinting demonstrating sunrise and sunset, light emitted by the red lantern in its different shading and position, the symbolism behind the red lantern and the women's condition within the mansion, and the draping in black curtains of Songlian's lanterns when she has committed a crime against tradition are both visually stunning and extremely effective in creating the mood of the time. Each woman's room fits hand in hand with their personality the opera singers (Meishan's) elaborate and bright coloring as opposed to the First Mistress' dark, old wood furniture and darker clothing. And lastly, what I have seen few directors do, Zhang Yimou shows us less to make us feel more scenes of torture and crimes, in many instances we are not shown them or the faces, instead we only view them from the perspective of one of the characters. The use of sound and long camera shots allows us to embody the characters and experience the story all the more, and because each of the four actresses dove deeply into the character of the women, this experience is truly amazing.

Songlian has had to quit college, as her father has died and the family can no longer afford tuition. Her mother warns her that to marry into wealth is to become a concubine, to which Songlian replies bitterly, cynically, Is that not our fate? Li has kept her face impassive during this scene, then just before it closes, a single tear slowly emerges from each eye, dropping one after the other. It's a beautiful piece of extraordinarily controlled acting.This scene sets much of the style of the rest of the film, as well as introducing the predominant theme of women's subservient, almost invisible role in that society. The mother is never seen, the camera stays static on Songlian, just as she is at the center of rest of the movie. Li is in almost every scene, everything happens from Songlian's pov, and in those few sequences in which she is not on screen the action is influenced by her character and they almost might be occurring just as she would imagine them.The opening also sets the emotional tone of the movie. RTRL reminded me somewhat of Scorcese's The Age of Innocence in that both are about deeply repressed, mini-societies built on social classes. The characters rarely express themselves directly or honestly, everything is below the surface, and tensions run deep. Periodically emotions and conflicts boil over to the surface and are quickly repressed again, w/o resolution. In this way the tension builds and builds w/o any substantive release.I won't go into the plot much, it's fairly simple Songlian lives in a bizarre world, the fourth mistress, the newest and youngest, to the master of the household she joins. There are 3 other mistresses, each progressively older, each receiving less and less attention from the master as they age. The plot is essentially about how the mistresses vie for their master's attention while they attempt to out-manipulate each other for that precious recognition.RTRL has complex themes, but I think the film is mainly about the emptiness and pointlessness of these women's lives in a society that sees them as having no worth, and how they destroy themselves and each other because of their insecurities and lack of self-respect, in an attempt to achieve (what they regard as) some kind of self-worth. At one point Songlian refers to them all as living ghosts. The women scheme and play petty games to one-up one another, they humiliate and degrade themselves and each other, all in an effort to be the Queen of their little world, a world no one cares anything about except themselves. The master couldn't care less, he laments that the women can't get along but he plays them one against the other and they all go along w/it, even though they know they're being manipulated and degraded.The women do not see themselves as having any significance on their own, it is only when the master lights the lantern in their house, when he favors them as sexual partners, that they become in any way of value in their own eyes and in the eyes of each other and the rest of the household. The master has an ongoing affair w/the servant Yan'er, who had hoped to become the 4th mistress. When Songlian barges into Yan'er's room she finds it full of red lanterns, a travesty that breaks the tradition of the household. Yan'er imagines herself a mistress, and this gives her self-worth, but of course it's false, just a fantasy. Yet her fantasy is just as real and meaningful as the actual mistresses w/the actual red lanterns - which is to say it has no real meaning at all.In the microcosm that is the society of RTRL women are barely acknowledged as human beings, they are sex toys and baby vessels. The mistress that has a son gains stature, while the one who has a worthless girl is ashamed and humiliated by it. At the end of the film, in a scene of chilling beauty set against the falling snow on the rooftops of the estate, the 3rd mistress is taken away and murdered. Nothing comes of it, no one seems to really notice or acknowledges it even happened. It's as if they had disposed of some garbage. Except to Songlian. In an act of rebellious despair, Songlian lights the lanterns in the house of the 3rd mistress and plays a record of her singing opera. It is as if to say She was here. She was a person. She had worth. In a final, great irony, the rest of the household thinks it is the ghost of the 3rd mistress singing and lighting the lanterns. Such are the lives of women in the world of RTRL Ghosts in death as they are ghosts in life.In the end Songlian sinks into desperation and depression so deep that she is incapacitated, regarded as mad by the rest of the household. In the final shot she wanders aimlessly among the red lanterns around her courtyard, a trapped and helpless spirit in a world where she feels she might as well not even exist.Harold "},{"Title":"Red Lanterns","Date":"17 June 2007","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" *** This comment may contain spoilers *** Songlian is a symbol of China after the Cultural Revolution.

The master burns her father's flute, which burns her connections to her father and her ancestors.Songlian's entrance into the family signals the onset of a competition for power, similar to Chinese Elitists who were competing for capital gain and political power. Songlian becomes tyrannical; her servant Yan'er commits suicide, just like the peasants of the Cultural Revolution committed suicide. Later, the third wife Meishan is murdered in the power struggle.The Sanheyuan is set up like the philosophy of Confucianism the architectural and structural design of the Sanheyuan permits a specific set of social rules to exist, and when these rules are implemented properly, the family will be well-run, and a well-run family contributes to a well-run government.Within these set of social rules, women are protected from outside hardships because they are cloistered within the walled boundaries of the sanheyuan, they are required to study Confucianism , and the family must be the prime focus.Upon Songlian's arrival to the household, the constricting Confucian ideology is undermined, and a Revolt begins.The ensuing Revolution obliterates Confucianism and the patriarchy, allowing female liberation and modernity to flow freely without restriction.Unfortunately, the women do not get to taste that liberation.

Songlian (played by Li Gong) is my heroine. Not the I- wanna-inject-you-and-listen-to-jazz heroin, but a sad and lonely victim of circumstance rebelling against her fate.The opening scene is Songlian's face, worthy of any Miss China pageant, as a single tear rolls down her cheek she coldly states, Become a concubine - isn't that a woman's fate? Yeah, it's gonna be bleak.Each night, the elusive Master will choose 1 of 4 mistresses to bunk with and a flourish of red lanterns are lit outside mistress numero uno's house - enough lanterns to be seen from orbit. Why? As this is tradition. The chosen concubine is served her favourite dish that night. As is tradition. The mistress will receive a strange foot massage. As is tradition. She will be bed by the master and lavished with his attention. As is tradition. Surely as Songlian is Master's newest object of affection he should favour her, yet there are petty forces working against her bitchier than your worst enemy from high school. Each mistress has manipulative ways in which they try to woo to the master. Because they love him? Not even. Akin to Stockholm Syndrome a phenomenon manifests and the isolation and loneliness drives them to jealously compete and be top dawg of the intimate hierarchy. One scene that struck me was when Songlian encountered a Pavlov's Dog effect - her feet ache and itch craving a foot massage when Master chooses to stay with another. Fate is a harsh mistress, more harsh than the ones who inhabit the four houses of this movie. Born a woman, our heroine has been dealt a bad Mahjong hand, but will try to play it best she can. The film is one of contrast and ridicules archaic rituals and traditions yet depicts them with mesmerising aesthetic elegance. It's a masterful piece of work and will haunt you after the end credits have rolled. Moral of the film Trust no bitch. "},{"Title":"Stunning masterpiece!

Well quite simply, it's interesting due to the battle you see between the wives who are subtly plotting against one another to gain the upper hand in status and also self respect for a guy whom they don't love, but feel that he is the only one who can provide it for them.There is a sense of claustrophobia in the film, as our main character, Songlian (Gong Li) at first starts to think this new life as a concubine is quite glamorous until she starts to see the reality of the concubines situation. The shots of the complex they live in almost gives a sense of isolation from the rest of the world and that they are confined in their homes to serve their one and only master, the husband they all share.The title refers to the fact that lanterns are raised at one of the concubines' houses if the master chooses to spend the night with the one with whom he chooses. You see the four concubines waiting to hear the daily announcement before they sleep as to whom will have the pleasure of spending the night with the master.Zhang Yimou's films often have a message which can be interpreted in different ways. Some see this film as a criticism of the Chinese Government in that it represents 'the master' 'loyal followers' and those who break the rules end up suffering for it. But if you see it differently, it is more about the repression of women in China and how their only way to gain self worth in these situations is through their husband who has full control. In a sense, the women in this film are treated like, as Songlian says, as a 'robe' that the Master can wear and take off anytime he likes. Songlian struggles to obey all the rules but also tries to play the political game in order to gain the master's attention.With its simple yet very well told story, with a terrific performance by Gong Li and the rest of the cast, it definitely is worth the watch. Highly recommended.

The main plot focuses on the complex duties and privileges of the four wives in relation to each other and their master. Each wife lives in her own house adjacent to each other. Each night they are obliged to stand in front of their respective houses and wait for the arrival of the red lantern. It is a signal from their master with whom he will sleep that night. This scenario expectedly invites a constant and intriguing development of plots, subplots and alliances among the wives in their attempt to gain their masters favor. In the end this dynamic escalates with the severest consequences for all. In this film Zhang Yimou visually introduced me to Concubine life in the household of a 1920's wealthy landowner. There I observed interior struggles of the Fourth Wife in ways comparable with the character development captured in films by Merchant & Ivory. From the opening scene to the very last frame I was mesmerized by the strong acting of all the cast but most especially with Gong Li. I was impressed by her abilities in Memoirs of a Geisha, but Raise the Red Lantern offered her a bigger stage to present the wide range of her acting abilities.There Gong Li presented a character who, at times, commanded presence and self-assuredness as she struggled to untangle the complexities of the duties and customs of a concubine in their master's household. Yet in the end, her fall from favor and her ultimate downfall was precipitated by her contrasting lack of self-control.I am pleased to have spent the time viewing this film. I would like to encourage those who enjoy great acting and a powerful story to do the same.

The best movies create new rules to go with this new universe and integrate the two with an internal logic which opens doors to corridors of perception and possibility in your own mind.  RAISE THE RED LANTERN is one of the latter for me.  It's one of the best foreign films I think I'll probably ever see.As an American with very little background in 1920s China, I was immediately immersed in the totally new setting.  The devious characters and surprisingly slippery plot soon similarly captured my imagination.  Almost entirely a one-set production, RAISE THE RED LANTERN's claustrophobia is appropriate to the similarly stifled life of the protagonist.  The characterizations of the four mistress rivals are all fascinating and disarming; none of these women are quite what they appear to be, but they are all consistent.  Fascinating to watch, the strange camraderie between the four rivals for their master's affections is a testament to their isolation and loneliness, which their master seems to rely on.  Obviously the social politics of marriage and the sexes aren't very different anywhere in the world, though some of the Chinese customs might appear to be. I don't want to spoil any of the surprises so I'll close by saying that this film is accessible for anyone.  Although it does have the seeming liabilities of being a costumed period piece, subtitled and ostensibly a chick flick given it's clearly female-skewed POV, this is still surprisingly mainstream, especially if you have any interest in a culture outside your own.  Even if you're not interested in broadening your horizons, I suspect it will be of value for the light it sheds on the way women think.  Deeply moving and thought-provoking, RAISE THE RED LANTERN is an eye-opener.  It doesn't always make you feel warm inside, but you will feel something, and it will be real.  10 / 10.

The protagonist genuinely develops as the film progresses and your views on each of the main characters continually shifts. One of the most powerful elements is that you do feel pity for the protagonist even after her petulant and vindictive behavior. The title of the movie appeared very odd to me. Probably the most apt title of any film as the weary rituals of the ancient household form more and more meaning. The symbolism of raising the red lantern is the soul of the picture. It represents the total power of the polygamist over his harem. Spoiler One of the most interesting displays of this dichotomy between the power of the men and women that the man is having an affair. But when discovered nothing happens. He is already legitimately sleeping with 4 women. When wife number three is caught the penalty is death. I also loved the little power the women enjoyed whomever has the lantern may set the menu.

Maybe, but not, I think, by amateur film enthusiasts or any but a few professional critics, and only then if they can tame their professional enthusiasms, can write well and know when to stop. That leaves out, among us amateurs, nearly all of us. As for the professionals, I've read only two or three commentaries by professional film critics that I think do justice to Raise the Red Lantern. Partly, this is due to the utterly foreign, cloistered culture we're observing. Partly, it's due to the intense but withheld emotions and motivations we gradually become aware of. Mainly, I think, it's due to the fact that deep sadness simply can't be adequately described, and the more we try, the less we convey. Songlian (Gong Li), a 19-year-old student in 1920 China, must leave college when her father dies. Her stepmother arranges for her to marry a rich man as a fourth wife. From then, Songlian's life, everything, depends on the attention she will receive from this man we scarcely see. The first mistress is middle-aged, serene and cool. The second is attractive and appears sympathetic and friendly. The third is young, beautiful and intensely jealous that Songlian may replace her as the most favored by Master Chen. Each has a maid. The servants reflect the attitudes of those they serve, but above all else, they reflect their roles in the Master's house. Again and again we return to an overhead shot that shows us where the universe begins and ends for Songlian...a stone courtyard with stone buildings on either side and the entrance at the end of the courtyard leading up low stairs to where Songlian now will live. When the Master intends to visit one of the wives for the night, it is the custom that the servants ceremoniously raise red lanterns outside the apartment of the favored wife. And this is all that their lives...and now, Songlian's life...consists of. There is no outside world, only their duty to serve the Master and to follow the customs of the Chen family, which goes back generations. If the red lantern is raised frequently outside Songlian's doorway, a servant tells her, she will soon be running the establishment. The other wives know this. Songlian is educated, sullen and resentful. She may realize that she must establish herself in the favor of the Master and find her place in the world of the wives, but we realize she may not have the guile needed. The intensity of establishing and maintaining place means resentments and betrayals. There can be no friendships. Songlian does not play this game well. Songlian's life eventually becomes as desolate as the cold snow that drifts down into the courtyard. Raise the Red Lantern is a gorgeous movie, as are most of Yimou Zhang's films. The seasons change from spring to summer to fall and to winter. We keep returning to Songlian and to the view of the courtyard, but we also see out over what seems the endless tile roofs of the Master's mansion. High on the roof is a small stone shed that is kept locked and which, it is whispered, had something to do with a former wife. At first the stone exteriors seem small and the interiors seem to go on and on. We see Songlian dressed lavishly to await the Master's visits. We see ornate furniture, wall scrolls, braziers against the chill and the red lanterns. We seldom see tears. Raise the Red Lantern is no tragedy, but it is a kind of slow-playing, hopeless melodrama. It is a reserved world where for these four women and their servants, everything depends on the Master. For Songlian, everything depends on her willingness to bend completely to this life from which she cannot leave, and to accept that there can be no relief from the need to scheme and plot to maintain a position against the other wives. To befriend can lead to betrayal. To sympathize can lead to rejection. To let slip a secret can lead to death. The customs of the ancient Chen family must be honored and followed, and can be cruel. To serve the Master whenever he wishes, with skill and charm, and to bear him a son, is what life has become, and there is no escape. The Master's life goes on. Our last view of Songlian is in the courtyard, in winter, wandering. Anyone who reads this should shake their head and wonder what all the fuss is about.

Harassed by her stepmother to get married for over three days, Songlian finally consents. When asked whom will she marry, Songlian answers that she will marry a rich man. The stepmother then intones that if she marries a rich man then she will be nothing more than a concubine. Songlian answers that it matters little.Dressed in her university clothes, Songlian makes her way to the family compound of the Chen family where she is installed as the Fourth Mistress. Only nineteen-years-old, Songlian looks to be several years, by two, three, or four decades, younger than the first mistress. Who Songlian states must be one hundred years old. The Third Mistress, a former opera singer, is quite aloof and avoids making contact with Songlian. The only mistress Songlian seems to be able to get along with is the Second Mistress, a pleasant faced older woman.Within the environs of the family compound there are a number of rules. Besides small things like the specific table where the family sits for meals and pregnancy rituals, several red lanterns illuminate the Mistress's rooms where the Master will sleep the night and the Mistress of said rooms will receive a foot massage given by the skillful Auntie Cao. While the lanterns and foots massages seem inconsequential, one of the mistresses informs Songlian that if one goes without a foot massages for three day, i.e. the Master does not pay her a visit, the servants begin treating her differently. Also, the owner of the room where the lanterns were illuminated the night before can also chose specified meals.It is within this environment that Songlian has come to live. Seemingly hated by the Third Mistress and even her own maidservant Yan'er, Songlian, who was attending a University until her father died, finds herself tangled in a system of tradition where backstabbing is the rule of the game. However, Songlian is not scared to attack back even at the risk of the safety of others.Played by the stunning Gong Li, Songlian comes off as a strong, intelligent young woman who is unfortunately ensnared in a less than ideal situation. While living in luxury, one can sense the boredom she must feel. Seemingly imprisoned in her rooms, Songlian is not even able to keep a flute, an heirloom of her father's, because Master Chen is worried that it was a gift from a boy at Songlian's university.Like other Zhang Yimou films, Raise the Red Lantern is a visual delight. Set entirely within the environs of the Chen compound, one can see a cinematic glimpse into the lives of the Chinese privileged during the 1920s. While quite different than the Su Tong novella on which it was based, there were no red lanterns and the First Mistress's son had a special friend, Raise the Red Lantern is quite an experience that was filmed during the height of the Zhang Yimou/Gong Li collaboration.

A fascinating interplay between these two notions of concentrating the gaze and letting float just so happens to power Chinese spiritual life, more on this in a bit.But now quickly to see what is it about, what clear picture emerges? A young girl has to enter a household as concubine, becoming one of four wives of a rich merchant who live inside a walled compound. So immediately the outside world of myriad possibilities and stories closes down behind her and us and life acquires a palpable order. Various rituals take place that together comprise a larger harmony. Magnificent red lanterns are lit outside the home of whichever wife the husband has chosen to spend the night with; the rest have to return disappointed to dark houses. A foot massage is given to the chosen wife that night, punctuated with a repetitive sound that echoes like temple chimes signaling the time for prayer. Other rituals the camera itself doesn't roam freely but specific views are established. Looking down from the tiled roof, another facing the bed. The husband is never seen from up close, as if he exists outside this order.Taken together all these modes insinuate a world that is meticulously groomed and controlled, given structure and color that ritualize appearances. Very Chinese. Each time the lanterns are lit we know one woman has been chosen to be the center of this world for a fleeting night, life given a ceremonial glow.But is this harmony that we see? The obvious point is a critique of traditional mores left over from the old days and accepted unthinkingly, lives stifled by the walls imposed on them and how the four women scheme and vie for primacy in the order of things. It doubletimes just as well as a veiled critique of communist walls. Party censors thought as much and the work was banned in China.All of this will be readily available to the Western viewer from our own traditions of painterly beauty and institutionalized oppression. We can rest there and speak the usual platitudes about the human condition, walk away thinking the film is all about how bad life was for women in China. Or we can - as with Mizoguchi before - attempt to cross into the world that gives rise to these images and reflects a more encompassing view.Zhang's meticulous abstraction (color - sound - camera - all of it bound by the cyclical turn of weathers outside) comes from a worldview where the same energy is felt to move through man and nature alike, not Western in the least. He's working in a long Chinese line of practiced abstraction with roots in the tea ceremony and the calligrapher's scroll where the effort is not decorative beauty for its sake. It's cultivated awareness that guides the spiritual realization that we are what we bring to life. The calligrapher controls his hand like someone who meditates concentrates his attention - so that it will begin to radiate effortlessly with what rises up from a unfettered, mindful heart.So if you don't just pass by like a visitor who looks pitifully at the cruelty of some faraway time and its victim? If you use the film to center within the walls of your own life that happened to you? In that case the film has wisdom in store, another view of seeing self and world.This is the notion that you have been born into this life and have now come to this house, circumstances made it so. Life could have been better, it could have been worse. We see a housemaid who'd love nothing more than to be a wife while the third wife manages to live a life without despair and regret that lets her sing freely. Will you add to the unhappiness, cause unhappiness to others, go mad?The title of this post refers to a mandala - a sacred space for the concentration of the gaze in Buddhism - frequently seen in Chinese temples; it depicts the universe as wheel and at the center lie craving and ego.

The film has sometimes been read as a comment on communism or feminism, but in its heart it seems to me like a comment on the human condition in general, and remains one of the best Asian films I've seen. The film's now famous distribution issues started in China actually, where the film was supposedly banned for a short time even though the script was approved by the censors. The controversy was apparently raised because the movie can be read as a criticism of traditional Confucian ideals. It was later adapted into a homonymous ballet by the National Ballet of China, also directed by Yimou Zhang.The movie is set in a single family compound and practically every scene happens inside its walls. This location also serves as a microcosm in encapsulating the past (or the current even) Chinese society in a nutshell. It's a story of several women trying to get recognition or control the situation in which they're practically powerless, bound to a master whose face is constantly obscured or out of camera's reach. The final shot of the Fourth Wife walking in circles outside her ex-room is particularly striking as it shows that fighting for progress and standing up for yourself is basically pointless and will get you nowhere as the system will run you over.The story takes place throughout the four seasons, and many of the outdoor shots repeat with a different weather mechanic or differently arranged lanterns decorating it, to portray the never-ending cycle of cruel tradition which lives on and on, regardless of the time period. The weather may change, but the lanterns stay. But really, you just have to love the visual design of this movie. Static camera and very formal framing, the beautiful usage of shades of red, the huge traditional housing location whose magnitude completely swallows the characters... I also love how the four mistresses' respective rooms are all designed differently, my personal favorite being the Third Mistress' room, full of colorful theatrical masks.

The story is told from Gong Li's perspective - she has is the latest concubine. The tension is all about the competition among the women for the only power they can have - access to the lord.Raise the Red Lantern, has a very barren feeling, and with so many wide establishing shots, this truly does resemble a Kurosawa design. The story rumbles with a grim ambiance and hardly ever escalates to an overly-dramatic scale. Zhang deliberately keeps things fairly distant and uncertain, and concludes the story on a dramatic and disturbing note. Such qualities of storytelling are rare, making Raise the Red Lantern a great film to see.

The competition for the master's attention becomes tough as Songlian will soon find out. Songlian never seems to be happy throughout the whole film. I don't think I've ever recalled a scene where she even smiled other than the time she got drunk. She does not even wear a wedding dress on the day of her wedding with the master. All she wears is a school uniform. By her wearing this outfit, the audience can get a feeling that Songlian is unhappy about her marriage with the master. Hoping to get the master's attention back after cutting the second wife's ear, Songlian made a statement claiming that she is pregnant. The pregnancy becomes false when Yan'er discovers blood on the white pants of Songlian meaning that she had her period and could not have been pregnant. Things are just going to get worst from there on. Ever since Songlian moved into the mansion, everything bad has been going on. This film revolves around a 19-year-old college student forced into a marriage. It has a great storyline to it along with the costumes to abstract the backgrounds. The director's camera angles were great in this. This is one of the best Chinese films I've seen. I would give this film a rating of 8 out of 10 and highly recommend people to go and watch it.

Zhang Yimou offers a glimpse into the time period of concubines and shows the story of our main protagonist, Songlian. Songlian is first portrayed as an independent young woman who has more than enough education women need during the 20's in China. Zhang Yimou develops the story of Songlian to show that no concubine can survive being independent without facing the consequences. Songlian is put through many obstacles and learns that obedience is number one in the concubine lifestyle after witnessing the execution of the third wife. Raise the Red Lantern shows the different side of being a concubine in China, which is the life of loneliness and distance from the outside world that concubines must lead.Zhang Yimou's direction in Raise the Red Lantern is the true star of the movie. Yimou's constant use of long shots is employed to convey the sense that everything is kept secret in this lifestyle. Yimou's use of color to make the scenery gray is used to show that this is a mundane lifestyle and that there is no getting out. The director's strongest message during the movie was with the third wife when the fourth wife came to watch her sing. The beautiful red kimono against the gray backdrop of the houses showed that these concubines do have souls and personalities outside of their duties as concubines, but as soon as the third wife saw Songlian, she quickly took off the red kimono showing that she must now obey and hide her true self. Yimou accomplished his task of showing the oppressive lives that these women must live and through the use of Songlian he showed that there is no way out.The only flaw in Raise the Red Lantern was the acting. Songlian did not convey much feeling and as the protagonist this was a mistake. The third and second wives were extremely good in playing their parts and showed their secret attempts to keep a hold of their true personalities. Although the acting was not much to rave about, Zhang Yimou created a beautiful film and in-depth look into the lackluster lives of concubines.

Like Truffaut's The 400 Blows alerting the cinematic world to the rising of the French New Wave, Yimou's film serves as fair warning to all that the best films in the world are now coming out of Asia.No, I'm not overstating it.In 1920s China, 19-year-old Songlian (Gong Li) is sent to the home of a feudal nobleman to become his fourth wife. While the servants treat her as a princess, it doesn't take Songlian long to realize that she is trapped in a gilded cage and that her life, and the lives of all around her, now revolve around the whims of one very selfish man.Songlian dreams of what her life could have been had she been allowed to finish her education. The third wife dreams of what her life could have been had marriage not ended her opera career. The second wife dreams of what her life could have been had she been able to give the Master a son. And the female servants dream of how wonderful life must be to live as one of the Master's wives.Yimou films the story with an astonishing beauty, giving even a scene of deadly violence (mercifully hidden from the camera) a gorgeous look. Yimou is also very aware of his leading actress's incredible beauty and he coaxes more expressions from Gong Li's face than it would seem one person is capable of making.If you have any hesitations about viewing a subtitled film, put them aside and allow yourself to be taken on one of the most wonderful  cinematic journeys you will ever travel.

The sad fate of Songlian touches everyone today, yet only a century ago this was reality in most of the world. This film shows culture and traditions very little known to us (in the Western World), and still there is the universal problem of equality for women. That's why the story of Songlian's maid, Nan'er, affected me even more. Not only was she a woman, but a servant to another woman; the lower of the lowest. The scene where Songlian unveils her in her apartment and the subsequent quarrel is one of the most touching film scenes I know. The character of the third wife is ambiguous. Having regained the husband's approval, and dating another man, she can't conceal her jealousy towards Songlian. Jealousy for what reason? 'Raise the red lantern' is a document of a time and a culture forgotten by most, but, as other events in history, has to be reminded of.

The competition for the master's attention (and the privileges that come with it) are the sole focus of the wives. Songlian is the only wife that has been educated... and has known what is to be free. In the constricted, feudal environment of the Master's palatial house, Zhang Yimou shows Songlian's physical and psychological imprisonment in a gilded cage. The most horrific thing about this movie is the fact that, in 20s era China, something like this could conceivably happen. The way Zhang Yimou gradually unwinds the story, with sumptuous colors and the incredibly believable acting of Gong Li and the rest of the cast, is beautiful and has a depth that most Hollywood movies lack.

She has a servant named Yan'er, who is in love with the Master, and is also the evil doer of someone of who is trying to sabotage the appearance of Songlian. When the Master decides that he would like to spend the night with one of his 4 mistresses, each one is called to a long hall, and a red lantern is placed in front of them, and then lanterns are hung, lit, and the mistress may have anything she desires for dinner, and gets to spend the night with the Master. This does not suit Songlian very well. We see that she has some sort of feeling for the Master, but after the First Sister's (they refer to each other as sisters) son, Feipu, comes along, she seems to lose interest in the Master.Songlian befriends Meishan, the Third Sister (a former opera singer) and sees just how far deceit can go in this happy household.

What I like the most is how this is shot, that is, With such discipline the shots are highly symmetrical, either horizontally or in depth, and often than not in depth. It's amazing, and shows what three-dimensional filmmaking really is all about. I talk of discipline, since they could have shot each scene the ordinary way, going far closer than they do, but instead they step back and let the space of the place suck you in. This creates a wonderful sense of loneliness in the context of the film, and the closeups then have added power.Speaking of which, this has somewhat ousted another architecturally brilliant film from the same year (1991), just as radical if not more in its use of space, but a lot tougher to sit through. The same with sound the contrapuntal dance of sounds and silence, just like that of long shots and closeups, beautifully emphasizes the few important motifs that the soundscape offers us.But the riches of the film far transcend only the technical, no matter how reinvigorating and masterful they be. Songlian's marriage, as demonstrated by the first scene, is actually an act of rebellion towards her mother and the values her mother represents. Dramaturgically there is an unexpected symmetry there, since when she gets to the house, she finds that all the women do just that, rebel and play the game with far greater ruthlessness than her.Indeed, the film plays out just like a game of light. The lanterns are lit, they change houses, with it all the perceived authorial power in the game (I think this aspect is occasionally misinterpreted as melodrama). But it wouldn't have worked without Gong Li, who is lovable, beautiful and subtle enough so that in the end we start reading our own projections and assumption on her face.As far as I know, there isn't a decent Blu-ray of the film in existence. I own a French Blu-ray, which is unfortunately not of a very good quality, and might pose problems for people who don't know French (or Mandarin!), since it's the only subtitle option available.

And I liked it quite a bit unlike his previous films - Red Sorghum and Ju Dou. The reasons were quite simple, Raise the Red Lantern was better acted, had better characters and story.Gong Li gives a great performance and it's easily one of the best performances in her acting career. The supporting cast is good, especially the actresses who played the other wives and her maid. This time there are no flat or overly melodramatic performances.The story is very interesting and it offers a lot of interesting twists and turns. Sadly it takes nearly 40 to 50 minutes to really get going which does hurt the pacing a bit. The characters are fairly complex and their relationships are the driving force of the narrative. I really enjoyed the conversations between the characters and cutthroat attitude was something you really see don't in Hollywood films. The only drawback is the fact that Raise the Red Lantern is sometimes too soap-operish and melodramatic. It doesn't happen too often but can get slightly irritating.The direction by Zhang Yimou is top notch. Like in his previous films, he creates great atmosphere and mood by mixing the beautiful visuals with music. The cinematography is excellent as always and makes the monotone setting more visually memorable and interesting.Raise the Red Lantern is a really good film. It's easily one of his better films and it shows. The acting is great, Gong Li is fabulous and the story, while dark and downbeat, offers something different in the period drama genre.

This is because the Master decides on a daily basis which wife he will spend the night with.

His extensive and vivid use of colour is gorgeous. More than 10 years before he directed his modern-classics, Hero and House of Flying Daggers, Raise the Red Lantern was there. The film has a simple storyline, a restricted location and a great cinematography. Oh, and it also employs beautiful use of colour. Sometimes I think Zhang Yimou is a product of an explosion in a colour factory. Raise the Red Lantern quite literally pits 4 women against each other and the film observes enviness, jealousy, hatred, anger, love & sorrow. Also, to some extend, Totalitarianism. Every woman wants to be the top mistress in front of the master and wants the red lanterns hung in front of their house. The 4th Mistress quickly catches the eye of her personal maid, Ya'ver, the 3rd Mistress & the 2nd Mistress. One thing leads to another and the 3rd Mistress ends up dead, the maid ends up dead, and the 4th Mistress goes insane, causing The Master to marry once more. Enter 5th Mistress, but thank goodness the film ends there, because another 2 hours would've been hectic. Not that I would've minded it, but enough is enough! I think the appropriate title should've been Personality Clash or This is how Women silently kill each other, or something like that.The pacing of the film is good. The slow and smooth camera movements did the trick. Red Lantern also employs repetition and I think it was a good move. It kept reminding us of what we're watching and what the film's story is all about. Unlike Hero or House of Flying Daggers which were clearly story-driven, this film was more character-and-music driven. The heavy metal? background music was awesome and I think it perfectly matches the mood and characteristics of the film and the women, respectively. From the performances, Gong-Li had the upper-hand, while He Caifi was just a rung below, but both were amazing in their characters.

It is a successful film. Under the rule of polygamy, the film narrated a tragic story. All the concubines live in a big house, the relationship between these concubines are not good, it bring a lot of strife openly and secretly. Song Lian is the main character of the film, the actress (Gong Li) made a perfect performance. The director Yimou Zhang used the simple scene and language to show viewers a shocking story, and also criticize the rotten old society. I think that the film have a lot of mentionable aspects. First of all, the film is full of Chinese characteristics. In the film, the traditional thought (Confucianism) showed in some plots. The steward always mentioned that all of people should obey the old rules. All the four concubines wanted to have a son. In ancient China, man have important position in a family. All the women should be compliant and loyal to their husband, or they will be punished. The third concubine was hang because of her disloyalty. The whole messuage likes a society, all the people are influenced by old rules, the patriarchy is entrenched. Besides, the costume of the film is filled with traditional element, the messuage is also Chinese outdatedbuilding. The music of the film used a lot of blow and beat mode. In addition, the third concubine performs the Beijing opera, which is traditional Chinese culture. Secondly, I want to say the character of the film and the stage set are well-designed. Especially the role of Song Lian, she is an undergraduate, so she has new ideas in that age. Because of that, in the film, Song Lian did not sit bridal sedan chair, took the luggage by herself, and did not like foot massage. However, as the time going, she became a depraved person. The design of this character highlight the feudal thought has huge influence in that period, even though the educated undergraduate also cannot escape its influence. In addition, the first wife is an old woman, the second concubine is a deceitful person, the third concubine is a singer of drama. These four women have different backgrounds and personalities, these arrangements enrich the storyline. What's more, there are many detailed design about stage set. The four women have different designs of room. The first wife is an old woman, so her boudoir is dark, the furniture is old, and the clothing is fuscous. The third concubine is a singer of Beijing opera, thus her room is full of dramatic element. Thirdly, I think the film has ingenious narrative approach and good foreshadowing. Director made use of the four seasons (summer, autumn, winter, spring) to narrate a whole story. It is simple and clear, but it is quite impressive. The beginning of the film is the dialogue between Song Lian and stepmother, the last words of Song Lian said woman is just like that, and then there are two lines of tears on her face. This scene let audience know the film is about the tragedy of woman. It is also a good foreshadowing for the following story. Besides, the word conflict between Song Lian and Yan'er is also an important foreshadowing for the succedent things.Fourthly, I think the use of long shot, close-up and music make the film more resultful. At the beginning of the film, there is a close-up on Song Lian for a few minutes. With the background of white window, the atmosphere has sense of loneliness and futureless. Director used a lot of long shot and close-up on red lantern, it work in concert with the title of film. In the film, master is a lightspot, as he never has full-face shot. Director through words embody the existence of master. Although we cannot see the face of master completely, the role of master fully reflect the patriarchy, he is a marblehearted people. This is a deliberate arrangement, it can serve as a foil to the dark of feudalism. In this film, a large amount of music is dramatic music. This can reflect the epitasis and the depressive atmosphere of the big house. The sound of foot massage is gripping, the singing of the Mei Shan (the third concubine) is bleak. The combination between lens shift and music make the character and atmosphere very dismal.Finally, I feel the scene of the film is exquisite, it is cinematography. The red lantern plays an important role. When the servants kindle the lanterns, the whole surroundings are full of vitality. However, when the servants extinguish the red lanterns, the whole environment is hopeless and tenebrous. This contrast further highlights the theme of the film. In addition, the scene of the four seasons is true to nature. Especially in winter, the landscape is beautiful, it is like a perfect picture.In a word, the film is well worth seeing. The story, the shoot, the costume, stage set and the music are all art. The film Raise The Red Lantern is a classic work. "},{"Title":"Plot slow in the start but flows with motivation.

With that, the audience can feel the atmostphere and emotion of the situation in the film. It orientates the audience about the family, the traditions and lifestyle as well as the underlying conflicts.Soon enough, the plot starts to heighten, showing more conflict between the mistresses, with the old master and with the servants. The plot flows amazingly well, using the different characters to drive situations and thrust the story forward.The twists in the plot adds dimension to the story and make you jump from hate, to like, to sympathy for the characters, bringing on a journey; almost toying with your feelings. The finger is pointed at you when you switch from siding one mistress to the other and from fourth mistress to Yan Er.The use of colour is motivated. It brings out the atmostphere in the film, portraying sadness and entrapment that the main character feels. Unlike in similar chinese films where colour is plainly used to bring out the richness, wealth and grandeur of the chinese people and thier culture (The Last Emperor), this film portrays normal everyday scenes in cold bleak colour but uses colour at key points in the plot to convey a message as to how the feeling is at that time. Even when colour is used, it is not to portray warmth but used to convey darkness and haunt.The story ends proving that nothing has changed, providing a powerful blow that contributes to the sorrow of the story.

It gets off to something of a slow start (the first 20 minutes or so), but then the tension begins to build and the film becomes a gripping psychological drama.  One thing I found appealing about Red Lantern is that while the film portrays a brutally patriarchal system in which women are clearly very oppressed and dependent on their lord and master for everything, it does not idealize the women or turn them into doe-eyed, sweet, saintly victims.  The wives and concubines are resourceful, smart, competitive, and very determined to make the best of their situation... in any way they can.  They can even be cruel and downright evil. Forget the cliche that men are interested in power and women are interested in love.  These women are definitely interested in power and status -- though, of course, the only way they can obtain it is by winning the husband's favor.  Yet their power struggles are just as ruthless as anything that happens in the male world of politics, business, or war, and just as fascinating to watch.The exquisitely lovely Gong Li is superb as the tragic heroine, Songlian.  Excellent performances, too, by the other women.  Visually, the film is strikingly beautiful; the camera lovingly caresses every detail of the interiors, while the severity of the outdoor in winter occasionally provides a stark contrast to the luxury of the indoors.  Sometimes the visuals are almost too lush, yet the style does not detract from the substance.A must-see, for anyone with a grown-up attention span.

The film deals with a number of issues and handles them with meticulous craftsmanship. It is a masterpiece in every aspects ranging from storyline to technical sophistry. This review will be focused on various necessary aspects of the film but there will be no commentary over it as an adaptation. The discussion will cover its plot, characters, technical elements, sound and theme.The setting of the film is 1920s China. Songlian (Gong Li) is an educated girl who had to marry a rich feudal patriarch because of her mother's will when her father dies. She therefore becomes the fourth mistress of the family that maintains traditions and its orthodoxy rigorously. She finds herself within a suffocating confinement. Her sole focus is narrowed down to get the attention of the master likewise the other sisters. Interestingly; along with physical satisfaction, the wives' charm in the house seems to rest on getting the foot massage which is given to the particular wife with whom the master will be 'spending' his night. Songlian is a quick learner who starts tricking and fooling other sisters just like the way they do. She builds a good relationship with the second wife (Cao Cuifen) and does not quiet get along with the third one. With a number of twisting discoveries, Songlian keeps on gaming until she uncovers something grave in a state of drunkenness in her 20th birthday.The character of Songlian is the most craftily characterized one in the film. While other characters, especially second and third wives are seen to be only fussily engaged in grabbing the master's attention, Songlian projects an amazing amount of sentimentality, sensibility, anger and calculability. Songlian's maid is also an important character who is characterized to a credible degree. Within a confinement of rules, traditions and orthodoxy; Songlian and her maid have expressions that are praiseworthy. The master and First wife's son Feipu plays a precise but significant role. Other characters serve up to their demand of the plot. This is one of the very few films where there are no unnecessary characters. Moreover, the acting is superb.The film has brilliant editing and incredibly meticulous cinematography. Kudos must be given to the cinematographer Yang Lun and Zhao Fei. The cinematography is so amazingly mathematical that it turns out to be a work of art. The precision reminds of Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and some of its legendary cinematography. Editing is very smooth and the superimposition in the last sequence are also uncannily perfect. The screenplay deserves a bow. It's literally hard to find any flaws in the technical sector of the film.The film uses very little sound. The songs of the Third Mistress are enchanting. The introductory music which is repeated several times in the film is very purposive and upholds the stereotypical fact that it is a Chinese film.The film deals with a number of themes. There is something graver than mere sentimentality because it must not be forgotten that this film was banned by the Chinese Government. The film has all the dramatic themes necessary to make a film attractive. But the main theme of the film serves as a critique of Confucianism that means it is a satire of the theory of a good family. Songlian's condition by the end of the film can be a critical psychoanalytical reading.To be conclusive, the film is a must watch for both film critics and movie-goers. The film critics will surely find this to be a soothing experience. On the other hand, movie-goers will surely have a good time.

Su Tong's novella focuses on Lotus (Songlian in the movie) from her arrival as the unexpected Fourth Mistress to Master Chen to her ultimate madness. Su Tong's story, although told in third person, is nonetheless centered on its main character. We initially encounter her on her arrival at the Chen household, when she is mistaken for a poor relation.  We know at once that this Fourth Mistress has not received the arrival honors her three predecessors enjoyed. (The film represents this by showing her journey on foot to Chen's compound.). Problems with the young servant girl who attends her are also featured in Zhang's film. The movie invents actions and episodes that clarify events in the source story. Songlian's feigned pregnancy, for example, has no parallel in Su Tong's tale, although the novella does hint that the Fourth Mistress' status in the troubled household depends either on keeping Chen's sexual interest (in the story, he wanes into impotence) or producing a male heir. The movie uses this invention to conflate plot points in the story, notably Songlian's revenge on Yan'er, the servant girl who loathes her. In the story, Swallow (the servant) is forced by Lotus to eat a tissue soiled with Songlian's menstrual blood, which the Fourth Mistress regards as a charm Swallow created to curse her. In the movie, it is Yan'er's revelation to the Second Mistress that precipitates her fate when Songlian punishes her by forcing her to kneel for days in the freezing courtyard. Also, the movie moves to its climax when Songlian, while drunk, reveals that the Third Mistress is sexually involved with a doctor who regularly visits her; Lotus, in the story, knows this, but does not reveal the adultery at all, even though she does get drunk at a key point in the story. Zhang's film brilliantly conflates the story and invents episodes that amplify and - for Western viewers - simplify what Su Tong presents mainly through his focus on the increasingly fragile mind of his main character as well as through images that don't lend themselves easily to film drama. Zhang also invented the ritual of the red lanterns, which serve as a structuring device in the film as well as a correlative of each woman's standing in the Chen household. The lanterns, plus the division of the film into seasons (Songlian's one year in the household), realize on film a pattern in Su Tong's story. That story remains worth reading, if only because by reading it one can truly appreciate the changes Zhang made and the reasons for these changes. Su Tong's story is brilliant; Zhang's film is even better.

Isn't that the fate of a woman?","Date":"5 December 2015","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" There is a master of the household. He has three wives, and is looking for a fourth. We see his wealth not in his stature or his speech, but in the architecture of the immense dwelling that can afford to house all four of them, like separate families. His face is never truly revealed, always turned away from the camera, in wide shot, behind a veil, or entirely off-screen (I am reminded of a similar treatment to the cheating spouses in In the Mood for Love), and this draws our focus towards the demure Songlian, and seems to suggest that these marriages are less emotional bonds between two people than means for furthering the family lineage. Indeed, the sexual servitude is so accepted that it is never necessary to portray it on-screen, and it has become a ritual or sorts, a competition between the concubines. The first is elderly and has already given the household its eldest son, and her dwelling has probably not been lit by the red lanterns for years, but she still commands respect. The second is waning, and seemingly welcomes Songlian with warm smiles and embraces, but yearns once more for the lanterns. And the third is still beautiful, but nearing middle age, and does not hold the same attraction as the younger, newer bride. Her room is adorned with large Peking opera masks, but what once entranced the master now annoys him. She has become the rooster at daybreak, eager to disrupt the consummation of the marriage. There is an air of importance over the family tradition. Whenever the master has made his choice, it is loudly announced, and the wives stand at each respective pathway to their own house as they watch the lanterns be lit (the first is never seen in these stare-downs, because she knows she does not even offer the massages of the second). The lanterns become a currency to garner favour and control of the household; the ability to pick the menu, and the chance to be impregnated, which is slowly revealed to be a vicious battle. When the second is forced to give a massage to Songlian, the third has a venom behind the sweet prodding smile. It is even pervasive enough to spill into the lives of a servant girl, not ugly looking, and favoured by the master, but ultimately of plain birth and unworthy. Songlian is at first nervous and intimidated, but she too learns to accept her life, and becomes furious at the invasive way that Yan'er has corrupted the lantern ritual. But she too is guilty of sin. A seemingly mundane task is made sinister as her lanterns are extinguished (and her the sound effect of the air being blown into the pipe is heightened considerably for dramatic quality) and black covers placed over them, for a seasons long punishment. Zhang Yimou imbues the film with an awareness of tradition. The first of these is the culture of gossip and scrutiny of others. Again and again we return to the same overhead shot of the central courtyard area, and servants mill around at sounds and cries of disturbance, and take it upon themselves to chastise their fellows who step out of line, and punish with severe consequence, all in the name of tradition. Another is the expectation of childbirth and sustenance of the family line, and the preference of male children over female, and how this sparks fire between the wives, and subdues the first, who is much past childbearing age. There is also much consideration to the visuals and the composition. Yimou does not seem to map out any distinct boundaries of the household, but there is no need, because the wives feel bound to their expected service over time. At first, Songlian seems to wander, curious of her new life, but only seems to bump into newer horrors. Later, she barely leaves her room, and orders food to be delivered to her. When the lanterns are lit, the colour red is intoxicating, and bathes the entire frame in a ominous glow. The first consummation, shot through a red veil, obscures the sexual act itself, and portrays it as a task that has been completed, rather than something born of passion and attraction. As the third wife sings alone on the worn grey rooftops, she is dressed in a red robe, and there is pain and longing in every syllable, but she does not wish to reveal this to Songlian, and quickly stuffs the robe away and ceases her tune, leaving the scene quiet and dull, and suffocating. Seasons pass, and one year, and a birthday, creeps up on Songlian. A maid, having being confronted with the harsh unfairness of the common class, is forced by her pride to her death. This is perhaps what keeps Songlian from complete submission into this life; she feels guilt for Yan'er's decision, and the demise of the third wife, who has committed an even bigger sin that cannot be remedied with merely covering the lanterns. As she approaches the forbidden highest room, the music grows tense, and the camera is shaky, nervous, before a cut places us far away from the discovery, framed much like the first sighting of this room. The air is silent, save for her hysterical cries of accusation, which do little in the face of tradition. The cycle continues, and a fifth wife is brought in. Servants once again whisper tales of a woman gone insane, who dared try to struggle against her fate.

I felt that the two-hour duration was nicely bearable since the movie piece in its puzzle pieces nicely and still keeps the ending quite unpredictable despite the story contains a lot of clichés about harem and the intrigue inherent in it.

"},{"Title":"Gripping, emotional and vivid critique of Confucian society","Date":"9 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Raise the Red Lantern is directed by the well known Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Zhang has created a piece of work that is rich with symbolism. His use of colour and differing camera angles capture the unspoken emotions and atmosphere constantly surrounding the narrative. Raise the Red Lantern reflects on Confucian attitudes and the welfare of women under this regime. Zhang uses cultural tradition to critique the past. While this tradition serves its purpose in the film it must be recognised as a conscious attempt by Zhang to self-orientalise. His use of hyper-real traditions further demonstrates his need to emphasise the exotic and make the film appealing to an international audience. Colour is used throughout the film to create atmosphere, depict emotions and symbolise power. Zhang has a history of using the colour red in his films. In Raise the Red Lantern I believe the colour red is used to symbolise power and also the lack of power. Each evening all the mistresses must line up outside their houses to await the master's choice of who he will spend the night with. The mistress who is chosen is presented with a glowing red lantern at her doorway and the approach to her house is lit by red lanterns. This display of red gives power to one over the many. With the honour associated with being chosen to lie with the master comes power of choice over the other mistresses and servants. The chosen mistress may choose what food is prepared for all, where she will eat it and can demand usually unobtainable services from servants and mistresses alike. In this instance the colour red is a symbol of power for the mistress. In the same instance this colour red can be interpreted as a lack of power for the mistress. The red lantern being presented to the mistress could also represent her powerlessness over choice. She has been chosen by the master to sleep with him; she has no say in this decision and must subject to his will. Yet another reading of this symbol is that of the western notion of a red light representing prostitution. A common symbol of prostitution in the west is having a red light over the doorway and lends to the name red light district. This western understanding of the colour red may have been adopted by Zhang in this film to further its understanding and appeal to western audiences. For when you review the way in which the mistress is chosen, is used as a tool to gratify the man and then left at his discretion, it has many similarities to prostitution. Contrasting the bright colour red is the muted backdrop of subdued hues of Grey. This backdrop creates a sense of melancholy and impending despair. It also highlights the bright red of the lanterns, furthermore emphasising whoever has the lanterns importance and power over the rest. I believe that the lanterns themselves are also very symbolic in the film. The lanterns are the lifeblood of the female characters in the film. When the lanterns are lit the characters have hope and life, when they are out they live in despair. When Songlian is found to have tricked the master about being pregnant her lanterns are not only put out but also covered. This symbolises her hope being quashed, she is from then on ignored by the master, left to live in the muted background and fated to turn mad. Another example of the lantern symbolising hope and life is with Ya'ner . Ya'ner steals lanterns to try and emulate the hope and life that the mistresses enjoy. When Ya'ner is found out she is forced to kneel in the snow while her lanterns are burnt in front of her. This symbolises her hopes, dreams and life being destroyed. She dies after this episode. Raise the Red Lantern is also a critique of the not so distant Confucian society that dominated China for over a thousand years. Zhang focuses his portrayal of Confucian values on the power relationship between genders. Such examples are evident throughout the film. The husband in the film, only ever referred to in the film as the master, is the patriarch and untouchable. The master has four wives/mistresses and has the power to call on any one of them to fulfil his needs. His mistresses have no choice in when or how they are chosen, they are treated as objects not as people. The fact that he is married to all four women and yet they are never referred to as his wives is an example of their lack of power and status. Zhang uses two characteristics common to Fifth generation film makers in his telling of Raise the Red Lantern. Both self-orientalising and hyper-real situations are evident throughout the film. Zhang purposely over exaggerates many of the cultural practices and the extent of their influence. He does this to draw attention and make the film more exotic and enthralling to an international audience. He focuses on the negative and brutal aspects of Confucian society to perpetuate the western belief that Chinese society is brutal and archaic. In his attempt to make the film more exotic he also creates hyper-real customs that he sells as authentic. Key depictions such as the use of the red lanterns, the use of the voodoo doll by the servant and the 'traditional' foot massage are examples of an imagined culture created for the benefit of the viewer. Raise the Red Lantern is a gripping, emotional and vivid critique of Confucian society. It makes use of extensive symbolism to enhance the narrative and further the viewers understanding of key themes. Zhang has focused on gender power relations, in particular the lack of power women were afforded in Confucian society. He has used traditional as well as hyper-real cultural practices to emphasise and highlight the moral miss-comings of Chinese culture and in effect has reinforced western views of cultural supremacy.

I found it riveting and terrifying.I am not going to try to repeat what everyone else said, but I want to say something else.When I reflected on the movie, I thought about the order of the marriages. The first wife was the master's same age. She must have been a beautiful local girl at them time of her wedding, but nothing special. Now she is an old woman resigned to eternally live in the shadows. She tries to make the best of her situation. She has no illusions about how things are, unlike her replacement sisters who are still vying for love from the master. Wife #1 seems aloof, but she knows the rules and she bids her time, like a cat. When she gets her chance to strike, she does not hesitate to kill.The second wife was younger, a cute, chubby face, and always laughing. She must have been a young, fun, exciting diversion from the first wife when he married her. But eventually, he got bored with her and moved on.The next wife was a famous opera singer. The master must have grown rich by the time he married her; and she was glamorous, exotic, sought after and talented. Who wouldn't want to marry a star? He must have convinced her that since she was marrying a rich man, and she was so admired, that he would love her forever. Then he married her and put his new jewel in a box, only to be played with when he felt like it.Now comes our protagonist very young, very beautiful and educated. She is not in love, but only in it for the financial reasons room and board. Her stepmother took her dreams of an independent life and turned her into a whore. The master said something about an educated woman being different. Apparently, with each wife, he was always looking for something new and different. But the bottom line is this she is just another sex object for him. I remember first wife said, How old are you? 19? Such sins.

Now I can't get enough of the limited amount of Chinese films that make their way occasionally. I am facinated with the many stories and learning opportunities these films provide about the cultures of China.Gong Li plays the lead character Songlian (Ode to a Lotus in English), a 19 year old student whose father dies and leaves the family facing poverty. Actually, the only remaining family to Songlian is her stepmother, who urges her to marry and relieve the financial strain on the household. In other words, she wants to get rid of the girl, marry her off. We meet Songlian as she makes the decision to marry a rich man who lives far from her hometown, and the decision is neither one of joyous anticipation nor giddy nervousness. It is a decision Songlian would never make in a million years if her circumstances were better. She marries a man who already has three wives an older woman in her 60s whose name is not given but who is refered to as Big Sister or First Mistress. The second wife is somewhere in her late 40s, past the prime of womanhood. Her name is Zhengzhou. She is friendly and receptive to the new woman in the house, but all too soon we learn that appearances can be deceiving. The third wife is my favorite character, the opera singer Meishan, whose voice is as beautiful as her exotic face and lavish costumes. She comes across as spoiled and jealous of the new Fourth Mistress Songlian, and is not above rudely summoning the Master to her house on Songlian's wedding night!!! She makes claims of illness and a handsome Dr. Gao comes calling often, to write Meishan prescriptions for her various ailments. The custom in this house is that red lanterns be lit in the house the master chooses to visit for the night. Of course, being newlywed to her, the master spends the first night in Songlian's house.The First Mistress is clearly of not interest to the master. He never visits her. So you never see him call for the red lanterns to be lit in the first house. Zhengzhou is getting up there too, and she is desperate to regain the master's favor. She wanted to bare him a son, but in the words of Meishan, All she had was a cheap little girl. Meishan on the other hand, has given the master a son, and feels that this entitles her to some sort of superiority to the other sisters.Like a twisted sorority, these sisters all secretly hate one another. The oldest is a sour old fossil who does little more than grumble about how she is old and unwanted and uninteresting. Zhengzhou hides her malice behind a benevolent smile and counterfeit friendliness. Songlian finds out that Meishan, the beautiful, spoiled singer, is not her worst enemy after all, it is Zhengzhou. Songlian gets this information from her servant, Yan'er, a sullen, young girl who has hated Songlian from the moment she arrived...because she is in love with the master and was hoping he'd marry HER, not some outsider. But as Aunt Cao, the nearly toothless old servant woman says, You were born to be a servant, not a mistress!!! and Yan'er's hatred grows all the more.In the course of a year, Songlian discovers her friend Zhengzhou is really an enemy who would love for her to die. Songlian's servant Yan'er hates her and, aided by Zhengzhou, tries to put a curse on her. Her friendly rival Meishan is having an illicit affair with Dr. Gao. Nothing is what it seemed at the beginning, and life is miserable. The master is allowed to come and go as he pleases, but his wives just sit in their houses, passing the time in boredom. The master doesn't even allow Songlian to play the flute. In his mind, only men play music, and he takes her father's flute from her and burns it!!!After scheming a false pregnancy to gain favor from the master, Songlian is punished by having her lanterns covered and no visitations from the master. Now the master is visiting Zhengzhou, much to the second mistress's delight. In turn, Songlian decides to publically punish Yan'er for lighting lanterns in her room, a practice forbidden to the servants. She forces Yan'er to burn the lanterns she was keeping, and to kneel in the snow until she is willing to apologize. Stubbornly, Yan'er refuses, and end up dying of exposure to the cold, an event that shocks Songlian to the point of drinking to dull the pain. In her drunkenness, she reveals to Zhengzhou that Meishan and Dr. Gao are having an affair, and of course Zhengzhou uses this to her advantage. Another shocking death occurs, and Songlian ends up losing her sanity and living in an eternal haze of psychotic regret. There is no happy ending or deliverance to Songlian's miserable existence in this prison of polygamy.Sad, facinating film!!!

What may have been lacking in story depth, made up for in visuals as this story of a concubine in China desperately adjusts to a life she was not eager to step into. Handed limited options, Songlian (the fourth mistress) is handed the keys to an elaborate castle, one full of red lanterns, foot massages, lavish food, and a maid to wait on her hand and foot. Alas, not all is as perfect as it may seem, with three other mistresses under one roof (coupled with a scored maid) - the events get dramatic, mistresses pine for time with the Master, and the hardships of living in this culture become clear as Raise the Red Lantern couples history, fiction, and amazing visuals to weave an important story to the screen. Admittedly, I was skeptical at first - a two hour film that deals with an archaic tradition that may focus more on the dramatics than an actual compelling story, but I was wrong. Raise the Red Lantern proves itself Oscar-worthy (alas, overshadowed by the Mediterraneo win) and coincidentally extremely passionate and watchable nearly 17 since it's release.Boasting big sets, amazing decor, and a taboo subject, Raise the Red Lantern pulls the viewer in with its stark realism, the elaborate nature of women in China in the 1920, and a score that is both haunting and refreshing. The smallest of scenes will pull you further into the film than imagined, and the subtle-ness of evil in contrast to women vying for the attention of one man is done in such a way that the emotions of sympathy, anger, frustration, and jealousy will boil up within. This is a movie that doesn't speak often, but says quite a bit through imagery and small actions. There is one scene in particular that was filmed gorgeously by director Yimou Zhang, which involves the discovery and subsequent downfall of Songlian's way of life. The long shot followed by her transformation was invigorating to say the least. Coupled with the stark beauty of winter, there is no question as to why this film has been lauded by critics and viewers alike. There is something unique about the way Zhang creates a sense of claustrophobia by keeping us in two-three rooms, yet each scene is fresh and new - that sense of stale surroundings is never present. This is a beautiful film, yes, but the acting is like more icing on the cake. Li Gong does a impressive job as Songlian, as we see her from the early excitement/nervousness about this change in her life, to seeing what tricks need to be pulled, to that question of sanity. This makes you revert back to the beginning of the film to wonder if something else had been missed. Your perception of Songlian will revert backwards as you attempt to see who she really is. Has she found a life, or merely unable to cope with the realities of the surroundings? Given the power of Songlian, it is tough to see anyone else stealing her glory, but Yan'er nearly does. Watch this subtle performance - as the maid scorned by another lover - she nearly steals every scene. Between these two, it is a delicate balance.With the beauty of the scenes and the acting, it is nearly a perfect film, but what pulls me back from applauding every minute of this film is the overall story behind Raise the Red Lantern. There were just these moments where Zhang used the scenery to fill time, where the story itself was merely an hour and twenty minutes of physical story, but the eloquence of the background allowed for more. Don't get me wrong, the story is important - but perhaps not two-hours worthy.FILM The film itself is breathtaking. Watch this with someone or alone on a snowy night. It challenges the mind and opens your heart to a part of history that needs to be discussed. I was reminded of our modern issues with polygamy, and how this Chinese tradition echos that ideal.VISUAL MGM's release of this film (up converting on my Blu player) is immaculate. If this ever finds a true Blu release, it will easily be added to the collection. The reds are solid, the whites of the snow are delicate, and the long shots of the Master's villa nearly transforms you from the couch to the screen. It is easy to get lost in Raise the Red Lantern purely by the cinematography. The 2.35 widescreen is amazing, no matter which size screen you are working with.SOUND Brilliant as well. The bold oriental sounds permeate through the visuals, giving two of our senses a crisp dose of intensity. The Chinese/Mandarin language with the English subtitles work to create the language, without leaving big gaps or being too overbearing. It nearly felt like a 5.1 surround, but it isn't specified. If it were 2.0, it was impressive.EXTRAS Lacking. The only downturn to this film. There is nothing that builds the character of the film - i.e. how it was made, director or cast feelings, etc., etc. - I think the only thing we have it a preview. Rather sad considering the immaculate nature of this film.Overall, I was very pleased with this film. Raise the Red Lantern is one of those films that you shouldn't judge by the cover. It seems like another drab historical film, but in the end it is nothing but rewards to both the senses and the mind. Despite the lacking features, I am excited about adding this film to the collection, and look forward to the other films Yimou Zhang has released.Grade **** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Women, what do you think?","Date":"20 March 2007","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I first watched this movie when I was young (10 yrs old) with my father who enjoyed art films.

The four wives then betray and backstab each other as each seeks to dominate the others.  The servants, too, become pawns in their game.Though undeniably well made, this is a hard film to like.  An oppressive air of joylessness weighs it down from first to last.  Songlian enters her husband's mansion in the second scene, and not a single shot thereafter strays from this prison masquerading as a home, where there is no color except for the red lanterns that signify the master's choice of which wife he will sleep with tonight.  We hardly ever see sunlight, only grayness.  Full marks for the cinematic craftsmanship, but the technical expertise doesn't make it any less depressing.  One feels that happiness in this place would be an offense punishable by death, and eventually that proves to be true.  The wives compete with each other for a prize that is not worth the winning the attentions of a man whom they do not love and who does not love them.It is tough to like the characters, who like neither themselves nor each other.  If Songlian were a sympathetic person, the tragedy would be more powerful, but she has a vicious streak a mile wide; her goal is to climb above everybody else and then wipe her feet on them.  Much is made of the fact that Songlian has attended a university, but her education has not helped her achieve any independence of mind, nor has it even liberated her from superstition.  And what are we to make of her tearful rage when she discovers her husband groping the maid?  Songlian knew before she ever married the man that she was sharing him with three other women, so this is not sexual jealousy she is showing, but resentment of a social inferior trespassing on ground reserved for her betters.Of the four wives, only Meishan, the third, appears capable of forming a real friendship, but we see it only rarely and from afar; toward the other wives she is as catty and nasty as the rest.  As for the master, he is a nonentity, a walking libido too shallow even to bother  hating.  The character I found myself rooting for the most was the servant girl Yan'er, who is just as nasty as any of the others, but is the only one to show any real defiance, any willingness to fight against the restrictions the house places on her.The clearly redeeming feature of RAISE THE RED LANTERN is Gong Li's performance as Songlian; she plays her character to the hilt, with amazing verisimilitude.  The writing may not allow her to win much sympathy, but you cannot avoid the feeling that this is woman, however awful, is a real person with real feelings.Oddly, the subtitles constantly refer to the four wives as `Mistress' and the IMDB credits them as `concubines.'  However, it appears that they are indeed wives, each married to the master; the Mandarin word used is `tai-tai,' which means wife.I think that Zhang Yimou meant this movie as a denunciation of polygamy.  It succeeds in this; never have I seen polygamy look less attractive for everyone involved.  On the other hand, with characters like these, you could paint a pretty unappetizing picture of monogamy, too.Rating **½ out of ****.Recommendation  Casual moviegoers should skip this one; hard-core cinephiles should not miss Gong Li's amazing work.

It also plays an important role in Chinese film industry as well. Thus, it won awards in different areas, such as Silver Lion for Best Director in 1991 Venice International Film Festival, Best Foreign Language Film nominations in the 64th Academy Awards and Zhang Yimou was the first mainland China person to attend the Oscar (Wikipedia, 2008). In fact, this is an ordinary story of five women and one man in 1920s feudal China when it was common that a rich man had more wives. It uses women's voice to tell how unfair women's position was in feudal China. Due to her father's death, Songlian (acted by Gong Li) is forced to drop out of school and marries an elderly landlord (acted by Ma Jingwu) to become his fourth mistress. During the first night, she gets her feet massaged, and all red lanterns lit, and chooses delicious food for their mealtime. Gradually,she finds not all the mistresses can get special treatment, only the one who spends the night with the master can. Every woman in the courtyard, even her personal maid (acted by Kong Lin), fights with each other to win more attention from the master. In this fight, women lose almost everything, even their lives. However, at the end of the story,the Master marries a young woman again as his five mistresses, and fight between the women still go on&#x85; There are some special designs in the film. In Su Tong's (2004) original novel, there is no light lamp, and massage. In order to give us a huge impact in vision and hearing, the director adds red lanterns and the sound of pounding feet.Secondly, there is no spring in the film. The story happens in summer, and then it develops into autumn and winter. In the end, the story goes straight to next year's summer. Spring is a season which gives people hope and energy. The implication is that women in a feudalist society have no hope. Thirdly, there are no close-up pictures of the master. Even in the end, we can not see what the master looks like, although he is the main actor. It makes whole film more horrible. Incisive and appropriate language is the one of the important features in the film. Songlian said, In this courtyard, human beings look like the dogs, cats, or pigs, but never like human beings. The third mistress (Hei Saifei) said, I am putting up a play, our lives are plays. We fool others when we play well. We could fool no one but ourselves when we play poorly. From these words, we can understand not only the characters of the people; we can also know how bad their lives are.Some plots are unsuitable for a Chinese family in high position in1920s. We can see in the film, Zhang Yimou uses the red lantern as a clue- who spends the night with Master is the only one who can get a massage and get the lantern lit. In order to light the lantern, every woman fights with each other. Deeply influenced by Confucianism, there are a lot of Li or rules in a big family. So using the lantern as sign of who gets the 'glory' almost can not appear in a traditional family. Like Lu (2007, P. 159) said, foot massage, ordering dishes at the family table, and raising lanterns&#x85;these rituals are portrayed as originating in the 'ancestors rules', although they are just as exotic for Chinese audiences as for Western ones.. At the same time, the third mistress hangs several Beijing Opera masks in her bedroom and her bedroom becomes more like as stage of the Beijing Opera. Again it is not suitable for Chinese 'Li' in house decoration. On the other hand, in a traditionally rich family, they care about Feng-shui, so the decoration in the family will all be square. Obviously, Beijing mask is round.As an outstanding director, it is almost impossible that Zhang does not know traditional Chinese Li or rules in the Chinese traditional family; however he still used foot massage and raising lanterns as important clues. Zhang cares more for symbolic significance than its usage. Although Zhang's movie does not follow old Chinese traditions and is not based strictly on Su Tong's novel, Zhang still manages to create an effective movie with his use of symbolism.ReferenceLu, T.

Gong Li plays Song Lian in Raise the Red Lantern as the fourth concubine of the master Chen. Having the master's company means Red Lanterns are lit in that wife's courtyard as tradition follows. Pride and power consume the wives as they rival, form alliances, and deceive one another to gain the attention and benefits of the master. The classical and almost depressing set up neatly conveys the battle for the Red Lantern as things get out of control.In just the first few minutes of the movie one can see just how tough China was in the 1920's. Song Lian's father had just died and so she is arranged to marry a 50 year old man, who is wealthy and powerful. Song Lian chooses to marry as she wants to prove her independence to her step mother. She becomes the fourth mistress of his mansion, walking in with her school cloths, once again showing she's the boss of herself. She differs from the other three as being the only educated wife, a rarity for women in China. However, she quickly learns things aren't as they seem in the house. The desire for authority lingers within the house as she is unwelcome by the servant girl, which she herself wanted to be the fourth mistress, first and third mistress. She's even deceived by the second mistress who put a fake smile on. As an immature teenager, pride overwhelms her as she joins the game of gaining the red lantern. The irony of it all is that red, as seen on the lanterns, is a color of luck and happiness, yet the setting is quite depressing with shades of gray and brown. Although this battle for authority and their own self recognition is fought passionately, no mistress is truly happy.One may think this movie is quite boring because of the dullness of setting and the lack of variation of the camera as it is always steady, set in one place at a time. However, there is a lot of significance that can easily be spotted making the viewer chained into the movie. The story is so plausible that one may even put themselves in that situation.

Each film stars actress Gong Li, each works as a companion-piece to the other, and each deals almost exclusively with the oppression of women within early 20th century China.Zhang's debut, Red Sorghum stars Gong Li as Young Nine, a peasant who is sold to a wealthy leper. Things only get worse for Nine, who must fend off a series of rapists, mean men and the Japanese Army itself, all the while running a successful winery. Throughout the film, Zhang uses boxes, deep reds and tight squares to amplify Nine's sexist surroundings. Indeed, the film opens with Nine literally forced into a box, a social reality which she spends the film attempting to break free of or even transform. For Zhang, China wasn't disrupted by the Japanese invasion, it was hell long before. Like most of Zhang's films during this period, Sorghum sketches the cultural and socioeconomic conditions which spurred China, with hopeful arms, toward Maoism.Zhang's next film, Ju Dou, covers similar material. Here Gong Li plays Ju Dou, a woman sold to a violent oaf (When I buy an animal I treat it as I wish!) who owns a fabric dying establishment. After her husband is crippled, Ju Dou forges a relationship with Yang Jinshan, a relative. When Ju Dou and Jinshan have a child together, the kid grows up into a mean brute. Like Sorghum, Ju Duo is a tragedy obsessed with rich reds, boxes and patriarchal violence. Whilst its plot superficially echoes Zhang's own adulterous, then-scandalous affair with Gong Li, Zhang seems more interested in the way Ju Dou and Jinshan hide their illicit affair from other villagers. For Zhang, the duo's tacit submission to social mores merely validates the notion that their love is scandalous and so merely validates the symbolic power of the crippled patriarch, a power which Ju Dou's son must &#x96; as per his mother's very own actions &#x96; thereby respect and avenge.The arbitrary nature of power, and how this power is always symbolic and always unconsciously maintained (via ritual, personal belief and shared delusions), is itself the obsession of Zhang's Raise the Red Lantern. Here Gong Li again plays a woman sold to a wealthy man. This man has several other wives, all of whom begin to violently fight one another in an attempt to win the patriarch's adoration. Is it the fate of women to become concubines? a character asks, pointing to the film's deft critique of feudal relations. Zhang's first masterpiece, Lantern is again obsessed with reds, boxes and sequestered women, though here Zhang replaces the voluptuous colours, camera work and widescreen Cinemascopes of his previous films with something more restrained. Because of this, Zhang's conveying of claustrophobia and oppression, of mind and spirit pushed to madness, feels all the more powerful.Next came Zhang's The Story of Qiu Ju. A near masterpiece, it stars Gong Li as Qui Ju, a peasant farmer who embarks on a quest to avenge her husband, who's had his crotch kicked in by a village leader. More emasculated by this attack than her own husband, Qui Ju's quest takes her all across China, dealing with a Chinese bureaucracy which seems quite helpful, polite and even rational. And yet still this bureaucracy does not please Qiu Ju. It thinks in terms of commodities, monetary recompense and punishment, whilst Qiu Ju (like Zhang Yimou himself, whose previous films were banned, without explanation, by Chinese authorities) seems more interested in acquiring a shuafa, a simple explanation and apology. By the film's end, both the primitive justice of rural China and the civilized justice of modern China are simultaneously mocked, praised and shown to be thoroughly incompatible. Zhang's first neo-realist film, Qiu Ju was shot with hidden cameras, amateur actors, and so is filled with subtle observations, cruel ironies and beautiful sketches of peasant life.One of Zhang's finest films, To Live followed. It stars Gong Li as Jiazhen, the wife of a wealthy man (Ge You) who is addicted to gambling. When this gambling results in the family losing its mansions, riches and status, Jiazhen and her husband are forced onto the streets. Ironically, this set-back saves the family; the Cultural Revolution arrives, and with China's shift to nascent communism, all wealthy land owners are demonised, attacked and killed.Unlike most films which tackle life under Mao's Great Leap Forward, To Live carefully juggles the good and bad of what was essentially a nation shirking off feudalism, monarchs, uniting and then trying, clumsily, to cook up some form of egalitarian society. This quest results in all manners of contradictions and socio-political paradoxes community, solidarity and a simple life save our heroes, but their world is one of paranoia, danger, and in which everyone and everything is accused of being reactionary. The film ends with Jiazhen's daughter dying, a death which is the result of both unchecked consumption (a doctor dies gobbling food) and communist reorganisation (all competent doctors have been killed/jailed for being counter-revolutionary). This jab at communism got the film banned in China (further highlighting the insecurity of the regime). Ironically, Maoism saw massive positive health care reformations, and saw an improvement in mortality rates which at times surpassed even then contemporary Britain and parts of America (life expectancy doubled from 32 years in the 1940s to 65 years in the 1970s). But such things don't concern Zhang. Spanning decades, To Live is mostly a broad account of life, love, loss and growth (the personal and political), all unfolding upon a canvas that is devastatingly cruel. Significantly, the film's title is both adjectival and a command; this is what life is, but one must nevertheless always push on. Gong Li and Ge You in particular are excellent.8.5/10 - See Black Narcissus.

Probably this is the real art when you only see several actors, everything happens in the only house (big though ;) except for the beginning of the film where you can see some nature for a minute ) And still after watching this film you feel like you watched something great. I can not advise to watch it to Speed lovers although I believe each & every viewer can enjoy this film if he leaves his prejudices aside.

She would have guarded the secret and used it as a weapon. These women were first shown to be masters of manipulation and then their actions were idiotic. I didn't buy it.

The scenery is beautiful, the setting feels very authentic, and the acting has no flaws. That's all well and good, but throughout the movie I had one major gripe I didn't care about any of the characters, except maybe one (the opera singer). From the master of the house down to the servants, every character was petty and selfish. None of the characters ever showed an ounce of concern for any of the others. I barely sat through the whole movie, I had a hard time sticking with it because I really didn't care what happened to these people, especially the main character. The main character was the worst of the lot, she intentionally chose her life as a 4th wife, and she spent the entire time being a whiny, stupid brat.Nor did any of the wives show guile or intelligence in their plotting against each other. If the movie was about a war of pettiness, I would at least expect a few clever ploys. Nope. Are these women just petty, bitter cows? Ouch!I'd give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars.

Which probably means that you'll enjoy it more if you're older.I'm at the crossborder between those two times.  Currently attending a university film class, I am Chinese person myself, and having heard my mom talk about it before, I thought that I would really enjoy the movie.  That unfortunately did not turn out to be the case.  Mind you, it wasn't a BAD movie, it was certainly much better than the many other movies that I've seen in that class, but it's kind of minimalist in style and very subdued and quiet in execution, and a tad bit boring for my tastes.  As such, I understand why many younger people do not like Raise the Red Lantern.Anyways, it's about a story of an educated female who due to her father's death, must become the fourth concubine of a wealthy landowner in order to support her family at home.  Zhang Yimou beautifully crafts this anti-Communist and pro-feminist film where the concubines are merely subjects of their master.  Vying for his attentions through various methods, the system that exists in this almost miniature Forbidden City contains red lanterns that are lit when the master comes to one of the concubines' houses within this gigantic complex.  With the lit red lanterns comes power within the household.  Chances to procreate and bear a male heir, further consolidating their role and position within the household.  Or even smaller things such as choosing the next day's dishes for dinner.  It's all a very striking and realistic look at how women were treated in China back then by the mainly paternalistic society.It's quite slow, which is the main reason why I'm not enamoured with it, and nothing really happens in the movie (aside from the fact that she must compete with the other mistresses of the household, something that I've known already, considering I've watched many other Chinese films involving royal intrigue and infighting to get more power etc).  The complex is quite gray in colour, lending it an almost prison-like quality, which these women unwittingly are pretty much in.  They're not allowed to leave, and they're expected to be obedient and subservient to the master (ie warden).  It's not a masterpiece of cinema, or even of Asian cinema, but if you haven't seen stuff like that before, and you really want to get a taste of what survival of the fittest is really like, or you want a good introduction into mainland Chinese film, look no further.  Raise the Red Lantern is a good start.

He is a master of visual depth, colors, cinematography and scenery and this one is no exception in that area, but it's everything else that falters.The story is about a woman who gives in to family pressure to become a fourth concubine to a rich man. She finds herself in a huge household full of rituals, traditions and rules, where the women's lives are so empty and meaningless, they spend their time fighting each other for the 'master's' favor. Along with his favor comes other luxuries such as being able to choose the menu, getting red lanterns and foot massages.It starts off well but then the movie becomes an endless soap opera with catty, bitchy back-stabbings and petty power games. There is not one sympathetic character and the movie just keeps repeating this theme until the 'tragic' ending.So the story isn't interesting; What about the alleged allegory? Let's see, an attack on a repressive Chinese government with its rules, and its patriarchal rule over the people and/or its women? Well if the Chinese people are really as petty, childish and catty as this, then I sympathize with the government.A feminist statement? I don't think feminists would want women to be portrayed like this, regardless of how the movie attacks the patriarchy. In addition, she CHOSE to become a concubine.So what's the point?

The Housekeeper replies, That's our Fourth Mistress. She has gone mad. She must have been watching this movie! I can't say it was a terrible movie, since my wife was quite smitten with it, but from the start it just failed totally to connect with me in any way. It came across as bizarre, soap opera type of interplay between the various mistresses and servants of The Master. All of them are jealous of each other and plotting against each other, and there's nary a seed of friendship or loyalty to be found anywhere. I suppose in some ways, if you have a bit of a hidden sadistic streak in you (and probably most people do, since stories about deception and betrayal always sell well, obviously appealing to unacknowledged desires within us all) then there will be something compelling about this movie, and, yes, it is kind of fun watching the women do battle with each other. Having said that, I still found my attention wandering throughout, and I nodded off several times.
