I find that he has an ability to play the stupidest characters well (Idle Hands) and the most clever (Shaker Heights). Anyway, I rented The Mighty because of its good rating and strong cast.It was not what I expected.. it was so much greater. I have seen more than one's share of films and trust that the Mighty will not disappoint. A gem in the rocks? Much more. I have never read Freak the Mighty but this movie has me out seeking a copy.Of course, Rowland's and Stanton's acting was solid. Elden Henson's and Kieran Culkan's are stunning. I believe this is one of Sharon Stone's best performances and Gillian Anderson shows her ability and range. Gandolfini was also as strong an asset as anyone else. This movie was just filled with stellar performances and moments that just make the audience get into the scene.I really wish this movie had been advertised much more.

(Max Kane)So says the imposing gentle giant Max (the excellent Elden Ratliff). He is a 13-year-old with a murdered mother and murdering jailbird father (James Gandolfini), who has twice failed 8th grade and lives with disgruntled grandparents Gram and Grim (the particularly morose Harry Dean Stanton and Gena Rowlands). It's a wonder he isn't Mad Max. However, he has a saviour. A minor miracle named Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin). Sounds cheesy, but The Mighty is anything but.Peter Chelson, director of the inventive and original Funny Bones, has lovingly superimposed Rodman Philbrick's successful children's book Freak The Mighty to the screen. The result is as moving as any kiddies film you've seen in the last ten years.Kevin is suffering from Morquio's syndrome, a progressively degenerative disease that makes him unable to walk without leg braces. However, the boy is a considerable intellectual giant trapped inside a small, fragile body. As luck would have it he is consigned to tutor Max in remedial reading. In the words of Bogart it's the start of a beautiful friendship.Kevin introduces the big guy to Arthurian legend. Every word is part of a picture. Every sentence is a picture. All you do, is let your imagination connect them together. If you have an imagination that is, he says.Inspired by the knights in the book, the boys invent a fantasy world in which honour is everything. Together, Max and Kevin set out to battle their foes, both real and imagined.Do not be put off by the presence of a Culkin or the mention of King Arthur. The Mighty is sincere, without being turgidly earnest, and genuinely uplifting. Sharon Stone equips herself well as the distraught mother of Kevin, but can't quite convince us that she doesn't ooze glamour. The bad kids also do not quite fit, resembling the troublesome urchins in Bugsy Malone rather than vicious Cincinnati hoodlums. However, these are minor quibbles, for ultimately The Mighty is several notches above the average children's film.

These two wounded souls see in each other what they would like to be. Max would like to be as intelligent as Kevin, and Kevin would like to have Max's health.Max's father having killed his mother, is serving time in jail. He is being raised by his aging grandparents. Max has withdrawn from the world. He is doing poorly in school having repeated the seventh grade and has no social graces. Kevin is a boy suffering from a debilitating disease that has made him walk with the help of crutches. Kevin is made Max's reading tutor. It's appalling to see a grown boy like Max struggling to read a book. With Kevin's help he not only improves his reading, but form a winning team in trying to defeat the bullies that make their life impossible. Max begins carrying Kevin on his shoulders all over the city.Eventually, fate intervenes in their lives. Max's father comes out of jail and he kidnaps his own son. Kevin, is instrumental in rescuing his buddy, but at the same time, his illness gets the best of him.This is a film that is deceiving. Judging by all the big names in the cast, one doesn't expect the movie to be basically about the two boys. Elden Henson and Kieran Culkin are Max and Kevin, respectively. Both do excellent work under the inspired direction of Mr. Chelsom, who gets also good ensemble work from his cast. Gena Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton, Sharon Stone, Gillian Anderson and James Gandolfini play second fiddle to the two young actors, who steal the movie and make it their own.This is a positive film about how to overcome obstacles in life without fear.

As I have elsewhere, let me register my protest that the two actors who occupy at least 95% of this film's footage and its dialogue are billed I believe fourth and sixth in the credits.

Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson both deserve at least nomination for best actor of the year, but you know Academy and others simply too conservative. The supporting cast also is fantastic (Harry Dean Stanton, Gena Rowlands, Sharon Stone, Gillian Andersson, James Gandolfini and others). Peter Chelsom's directing was outstanding. Now about sound. The music in the movie was great and emotional so like main theme Freak, the Mighty. I can't believe that this song didn't win best song award. Anyway, it is one of my favorite themes from the movies. All dialogs in the movie were strong and memorable, and some incredibly touching and moving scenes you will never forget. My grade 10 or A+++.

If you haven't seen it before borrow it, rent it, or buy it as soon as you can.It's sad to say but I must say a few words about Miramax and it's marketing.

And so Stand by Me led to the TV series The Wonder Years (1988), which led to Woody Allen's Radio Days, Brighton Beach Memoirs, Radio Flyer (1992), Man in the Moon (1991), Jack the Bear (1993), This Boys Life (1993), King of the Hill, Now and Then (1995), Unsung Heroes (1995), The Mighty (1998), Simon Birch (1998) etc etc.These films all employed a rich and romantic visual style which recalled the paintings of Norman Rockwell. They featured older and wiser narrators who reminisced about their childhood days, revolved around small groups of young boys, largely took place in the 60s and early 70s, and oozed a sense of nostalgia.Significantly, all these films also yearned for escape. These kids (or rather their future adult selves) are all searching for a romanticised version of Americana. A forgotten, or perhaps nonexistent, age of white picket fences, carefree wandering, pop sodas and family dinners. Behind all this comfortable nostalgia, though, is a sense of menace. Abuse, suicide, murder, the lingering effects of the Vietnam war and drunken fathers, all linger in the background.Covertly, these films are also implicitly about how early circumstances influence a person's later identity. They're all told from the point of view of an adult, looking back at his past life.This trend started in the 80, by artists who were born post WW2 and became young men in the mid 60s. By the late 90s the unseen enemy of these films stopped being about war, poverty, absent fathers, abuse and alcoholism, and started to be about disease and genetic disorders. The idealised Norman Rockwell version of Americana was still there, but now Generation X seemed to obsess over diseases and genetics. For Generation X, misery seemed to be all about ailments and genetic predisposition, like the kids with Morquio's syndrome in The Mighty and Simon Birch or AIDS in The Cure. Stand by Me- 8/10, The Mighty- 7.9/10, Simon Birch- 7/10, The Cure- 5/10, Radio Flyer- 4/10, Jack the Bear- 7.5/10, This boys life- 8/10, Now and then- 3/10, Man in the moon- 7.5/10I think these films are interesting if you treat them as a single batch. Stuff like Radio Flyer and Now and Then have that whole kitschy Spielberg vibe. They're pretty worthless. The Tom Hanks cheesefest Radio Flyer and the Rosie O Donnell travesty Now and Then are pretty terrible. The Mighty's somewhere in the middle.

It may sound simple, but it is a beautiful film, and a very inspirational one. I think one of the things that made it so great was the many references to the tale of King Arthur and his knights of the round table. The two kids both have a great charisma and personality too, and great on-screen chemistry. The plot is very good, something that anyone who has ever felt like an outsider can relate to. It takes off from the very first frame and continues at a good, steady pace, that won't skip any details, nor leave you bored for a second. The acting is excellent, especially by the two child actors, Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson. Both pull off fantastic, believable performances, and really makes you care about these characters. The adult actors also portray their respective characters well. Every single character is credible and well-written, in just about any of the scenes. I really liked the way the two main characters, Kevin and Max, complete each other, the way they are more or less weak separately, but together they are strong and powerful. They make up for each others weaknesses, and their strengths complement each other. The film is very moving, a scene near the end nearly brought a tear to my eye, something very few movies do. The very end is the ultimate development and the perfect ending for the film; I won't write it here since I wouldn't want to spoil the film for anyone, but I can say that it was a very beautiful, almost poetic ending. I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but few dramas have moved me as much as this did. Excellent script, excellent acting, excellent cinematography... the film has everything a good drama needs.

If there is one film I would highly recommend this year, this is it. Sharon Stone is a mother of a son with a physically disabling and potentially fatal disease. The son doesn't let this disease slow him down and he goes off facing the challenges of everyday life that lay ahead of him. Unfortunately, not everyone understands his disease or shows sensitivity to his physical condition. He is abused by classmates and has no friends until he meets the kid next door. The neighbor kid has a learning disability and through a variety of situations, the two become friends. Together they go out and face the world as if they were knights in King Arthur's court. The film has some great messages of friendship and understanding. While the film shows the difficulties of living with a disability it shows strength and courage in dealing with it. A few scenes were extremely emotional in nature and only the most hardened-heart would not be moved or touched by them. To this end, the Director should be commended. One review (even I read other reviews) describe this film as being emotionally-manipulative, but I say...who cares? Any time a Driector is successful at causing an emotional response from the audience...I consider that a positive sell-point of the film. Bottom line....while I haven't said much about the actual content of the film...I will leave that for you to experience on your own....go see it...you will be glad you did....this film can touch and inspire you in a world that sometimes doesn't.

If you read any of the following reviews, they can fill in the story for you, but if you can.....avoid hearing anything about the film and just watch it.  As stated previously, the cast is superb.  Old pros like Harry Dean Stanton and Gena Rowlands (as well as a very able Sharon Stone; who makes quite the departure from her usual film fare as the not very glamorous mother of Freak), frame this wonderful film. But Culkin and especially Ratliff easily carry this film.  If you come away with anything after watching this film its that everyone deserves a chance, and that the human spirit can always triumph.It makes perfect sense to me why this film did not fare well at the box office.  Because its really really good!   There's no violence (in the Action movie sense), no high profile sex and no teeny-bopper high school angle.  Just an excellent story, two fantastic leads and a wonderful supporting cast.  Its a darn shame that there are not more quality films like this being released today which gain the good graces of the entertainment marketing machine.  If its on cable, watch it.....if you see it in the video store....rent it.  Its upsetting at times (just like life) but overall, it makes you feel good.

I eventually was curious enough to look at the case and figured out it was that movie I'd seen on TV. I rented it... again.. and again..I just watched it for probably the 5th or 6th time last night. Really, I think this movie touches me more strongly every-time I see it. I was as amazed and bowled over by the sheer emotions and inspiration of it all, just as if it had been my first time watching it. I think a lot of it is due to the young man (also in the Mighty Ducks movies) that plays Max Cane, the large, allegedly slow-witted young man. I think it's his performance, his emotions and his character development that make this such a touching movie. But the other actors are great too. I think Kierran did a great job, despite not having Dwarfism like his character is supposed to have. I think they should have found another condition that cripples and limits lifespan, and said THAT was what Freak had.. because (from what I understand) Moqurio's is a form of Dwarfism, and Kierran doesn't come across that way, despite being thin and not a big boy, and their efforts to make him hunchback... Other than that very forgivable flaw this movie is definitely FAR superior to Simon Birch, both in story, acting, inspiration, and heart. Definitely check this movie out if you like movies that make you believe in the power of friendship, and it's ability to change your life.

Once in a while, from Hollywood their comes a real gem, succeeding in getting famous names like Sharon Stone and Harry Dean Stanton (although the latter is not a star, he's strong in characters). The film deals with the friendship of two boys, one of them (Culkin) handicapped. The neighborhood boys like to make fun of him, until he gets to know his friend, a loner like himself, who helps him. Both guys are quite the opposite of each other the one is clever, and quick at inventing things, but handicapped, the other a little bit slower, but has his heart at the right place. Both can learn from each other that tolerance is very important in a friendship, and, above all, a good friend should be counted on, whatever may happen. Unfortunately, at the end of the film, The Mighty has to die, due to a long sickness. The end is therefore very heart-rending, and even I was lucky to had a handkerchief at reach. So what makes this movie recommandable? First of all, it can put its strengh from marvellous actors like Sharon Stone, that gives a very good performance as the sick boy's mother. Harry Dean Stanton, the alcoholic father of the other friend, in not so bad at all, but he simply has no patience and cannot keep apace with his son. The second point is that the film mixes reality and fiction, a good example of this the two boys going on a stroll, being accompanied by knights. The wonderful soundtrack from Sting does the rest.

Soon, they become inseparable, joined by a deep brotherly love.Through a series of events away from home, their attachment and dependence deepens. Unavoidably, there are realities that come into play for both of them, the last of which will cause tears to run down your face. Your feelings will surface, so keep the Kleenex close by.Sharon Stone, in 1998, was without question easy on the eyes, and although this movie doesn't set out to display that unquestionable fact, the camera is completely unable to free us from the truth. As a caring, loving mother, she shows an understanding and sensitivity both to her son and his condition, inventiveness and intellect, responding with loving words, even while she takes risks.

Elden Henson failed seventh grade twice making him the target of mockery. Kieran Culkin is new to the neighborhood and lives with his mother. He is also a hunchback who uses braces to walk. They are fascinated about the story of King Arthur and several sequences feature knights and horses in relation to the two friends who imagine themselves in such a way when Culkin mounts Hensen's shoulders as one strength. Director Peter Chelsom goes inside the imaginations of these boys. Culkin and Hensen make a remarkable pairing but the ending is depressing. The images of their adventures are enchanting and add both fun and tension. Sharon Stone plays Culkin's mother in a somewhat standard role but believable nonetheless. Harry Dean Stanton and Gena Rowlands are also featured as relatives who knows of Hensen's father's past and seek to prevent it from ever crossing them again. Viewers may be divided since the imagination material is aimed at children while the suspense is aimed at adults but it might make for a discussion if viewed together. Theme of friendship gives the film meaning and a sense of might.

He fears the return of his imprisoned killer father (James Gandolfini). He is hounded by classmate Blade and his Doghouse Boys. Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin) is his cripple next door neighbor with his mother (Sharon Stone). Blade bowls Kevin over and blames it on Max. Max gets detention and Kevin starts tutoring him. They become friends imagining themselves as a Knight in King Arthur's Roundtable as Freak the Mighty.The movie starts off poorly with the school bullies. They are very much two dimensional cartoons and played by weak kid actors. Elden is basically silent except for his narration. Kieran Culkin does a good job with a nice performance and has nice chemistry with Elden. The movie starts off weakly. Then the kid bullies take a backseat and Gandolfini makes a surprise appearance. He shocks the movie into another gear despite the odd accent from Gillian Anderson and the outlandish journey of Kevin. This is hardcore sentimental. I like the idea but the execution isn't the best.

All around great.","Date":"3 April 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" The Mighty is a relatively simple film. It involves the strong friendship between a small boy with Morquio syndrome and a large boy who had a killer for a father. Together the two grow in friendship and empathy for one another. I could go on and on for the specifics of the plot but I don't really need to. The plot is simple but complex. Here that is a good thing. It's about two misfits that go through good and bad times. This film is truly marvelous. It's a rare film that can touch your heart in a way that most cannot. Really The Mighty is just about life and what you make it. The Mighty is based off one of my favorite books Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick which got an adequate sequel, Max the Mighty. I honestly think the movie is superior to the book. The film has a fantastic script and an amazing cast. What really surprised me was Sharon Stone's performance. She really can act and it's a shame that she isn't in more films like this. Anyway, just find a copy of this film and check it out. It's a truly great movie. Every time I see it I laugh, I cry and I learn what it means to live. I think that this and 2004's Man on Fire are two of the most underrated movies of all time. This film is truly great and one of my favorite movies. Just find it and watch it.

Whoever plays the big kid does a great job as well.

It deals with disability, and really delivers a message.The acting on all fronts is fantastic, Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson are fantastic as the two leads, and the stellar supporting cast are perfectly understated, and don't overpower the 2 young leads.  Sharon Stone is convincing as the mother of Kevin, the boy with a spinal defect, and Gillian Anderson stands out in an unconventional role as Loretta Lee, the hooker with a heart.All in all, it's a real tearjerker at the end and is definitely worth a watch.

"},{"Title":"Good movie (Careful, possible spoilers)","Date":"21 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  After watching the great movie The Cure, I went on a binge of emotional, tearjerker movie. The Mighty, by Peter Chesolm and starring Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson, was one of the best.Yet it follows a relatively common formula Max Kane (Henson) is a slow-witted giant of a boy who is frequently bullied at school. He lives with his grandparents (Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton) in a poor part of Cincinnati as his mother is dead and his father's in prison. He leads a stable yet unhappy life, picked on by Blade and the doghouse boys because he can't read. Then Kevin Dillon (Culkin) moves in next door. Kevin is immensely bright and has a loving mother (Sharon Stone in a rare low-key role), but he is crippled by Morquio's syndrome, a disease where his bones stop growing but his internal organs continue to do so.He is hired as Max's reading tutor and soon initiates a friendship. He introduces Max to reading and to the imaginary world of King Arthur and the Knights of the round table, effecively lending him his brain. In exchange, Max carries Kevin around on his shoulders, effectively becoming his legs. Together they roam the town as the knight Freak The Mighty, going on quests, doing good deeds and getting into trouble. Yet throughout their adventure, Kevin's disease and Max's recently paroled father loom over them like shadows.I won't tell anymore, but the end result is an extremely uplifting story about the value of friendship and the human ability to overcome hardship and sadness with the powers of love and caring. The Mighty is thus in the same league as The Cure, although it doesn't quite hold the latter's magic, maybe because it was made later.Yet it is in no way without qualities. The acting is impeccable. The supporting cast is fantastic, my favorites are Harry Dean Stanton as Grim and Gillian Anderson (not usually my favorite actress) as Loretta Lee, one of Kenny Kane's (Max's dad, played by James Gandolfini) old friends. Stanton has his usual charisma and Anderson's character is quirky and amusing. But the others are good as well. I mean, it's a stellar cast! But the real stars are, as is often the case in this kind of film, the kids. Elden Henson has the ever-important expressive face and gives a mesmerising performance. The end scene when he runs barefoot through the town is made spellbindingly emotional thanks to him. And Kieran Culkin is great as Kevin, he is smart and funny yet also encourages our sympathy and our emotion.Much better than Macauley! Together, Culkin and Henson rival Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro from The Cure in terms of acting talent. Yet one of The Mighty's problem lies with the actors, or more in their presentation. It has often been remarked that Miramax showed unbelievable incompetence when it came to the publicity and I would just like to add my own indignation to that of other viewers and of the cast (Culkin was annoyed that Miramax pushed back the release date, allowing Simon Birch to be released first). To advertise The Mighty as a Sharon Stone flick was a disaster. Too many studios undermine the young stars in favour of promoting the more famous supporting cast. It happened with Radio Flyer, yet The Mighty is ridiculous. Culkin and Henson's names appear after the movie's title in the opening credits! Anyway, ranting finished. Back to the positive stuff! Apart from the acting, the direction is good as well. Chelsom's camera is fluid and there are no goofs and the whole film is very pretty to look at. I would reproach a slight overdose of colour, it tends to detach the viewer from the reality of the picture, making it seem less real. But I suppose that it's to put an accent on the imagination side of things.The music is great as well. Trevor Jones' score has the right feel for the movie, with very medieval tunes and some very emotional melodies. It's up there with the scores of The Cure (Dave Grusin-fabulous) and Stand By Me (Jack Nitzsche-ditto). I also love the theme tune, 'Freak The Mighty', by Sting.All in all, this is a pure, unadulterated emotional movie. The characters are endearing, the music is touching and the story is at times humorous yet fundamentally designed to provoke thought and a few tears. Again, it's a film about friendship, which is a sacred value. It's up there with The Cure, stand By Me and The Straight Story. In fact, here's the list of my favorite emotional movies 1)Stand By Me 2)the Cure 3)=The Straight Story 3)=The Mighty 4)Central Station 5)Elephant Man 6)Simon Birch 7)Radio Flyer (I could've included the Spielberg greats, Empire of the Sun and Scindler's List, but they are part historical dramas. Also note that Central Station, Elephant and The Straight Story have more artistic value than the others, but that I'm just taking their emotional value into account.)Enough competition. The Mighty is a fantastic movie that all ages can enjoy. It is smart, funny, profound and infinitely touching. I recommend for anyone who enjoyed The Cure or Stand by Me. The acting is teriffic! 8/10Uppers 1)The acting, especially  from Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson; 2)Chesolm's direction; 3)The music; 4)Sting's song; 5)The scene where Max runs through town at the end; 6)The dialogues and the humour; 7)The fireworks scene; 8)The very last scene with the book and the ornithopter; 9)It's incredibly emotional; 10)The scene where they walk high above the world; 11)Great chemistry between the two boys.Downers 1)Miramax's bungled publicity; 2)Why isn't it called Freak the Mighty like the book?; 3)Jingle Bells scene is a bit twee; 4)Maybe just a bit too much color.

Henson is the gentle giant who isn't overly smart who gets Culkin assigned to him as a tutor. From this begins a friendship that grows stronger and stronger even as Culkin's character gets weaker.

Based on a children's book, 'Freak the Mighty', the film manages to portray the challenges and and friendship of two special young people without being patronizing.Max, played brilliantly by Eldon Ratliff, is a slow boy, big for his age, whose mother was killed by his father, who is now serving a prison sentence. Max is being raised by his grandparents, the appropriately weary Gene Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton. Max has failed 7th grade twice, and is the butt of teasing and jokes. His life is changed when Kevin, played by Kieran Culkin (Macauley's more-talented younger brother) moves next door with his single mother, well played by Sharon Stone. Kevin is physically disabled, with a degenerative bone disorder. He has compensated for his disability by being a genius. He is also stronger than Max, the only thing he lacks is Max's physical strength. The two work together, with Max being Kevin's legs, and Kevin being Max's brain.The world can be an empty place for people who are different, and Max learns and grows from his friendship with Kevin. The movie never resorts to cheap sentimentality, and this was one of the first films to make me cry in a long time. I don't agree with the criticism that Sharon Stone is too attractive to be Kevin's poor mom. All kinds of people have children with disabilities. There was no need to make Sharon Stone less beautiful, since this film is about the boys, and she is the mom, a supporting role, and her good looks are not really an issue.I was disappointed in Gillian Anderson's performance as a white trash biker chick. She seems to be borrowing from the Sandy Dennis school of facial twitches, and feels a need to resort to a southern accent to emphasize that her character is from the wrong side of the tracks. Other than that, the movie is excellent, particularly the performance of Eldin Ratliff, who has a great future ahead of him.

I must have been in 7th grade, and like freak and max, I wished that I had lived in that world and not the urban sprawl that I did live in. I used to think that my school was a castle and my apartment was a cottage. In reality, my school was a hellhole-with just a faint glimmer of good, and my home was ramshackle at best, but there was enough goodness in my world that I was able to identify with the goodness that king Arthur presented me. And then I grew up, forgot about my daydreams and started thinking about real life. Until today that is. While watching The Mighty I was struck by the imagery. There is nothing quite as touching as the image of a small kid on a another kid's shoulder, rising him up to see the fireworks. You would think that Max's move could be seen as patronizing and full of pity, but it isn't shown that way. It is shown for what it really was and what the movie proved later, that though Max might have looked like a Frankenstein, he had a heart inside him. The next motif that struck me was later in the film were a building important to the plot was made to look like a tower.This movie went all the way towards making us believed that the world that Max and Alex built was real, just as real as the world grownups inhabit. Also let me not forget the use of Elden Henson figure expression. Though he has only been in a few movies, he really showed me something, reminding me of another big kid with talent, Charlie Talbert from Angus. Both have the ability though Henson may be the better actor. The way he walked, talked, cried and just was, made me believe everything else the movie was telling me. The strongest image and the one that I plan on taking with me, among many others, is Max's face with his eyes closed, deep in thought, mind racing and. we see the struggle that he is making but we also see the peace that he feels. I really look forward to seeing Elden Henson (Elden Ratliff here) in anything else he makes, he was good in idle hands but I think that his strong suit will be dramatic roles.  This movie was perfect visually the script was good, but the story was so well presented that the lack of real throat grabbing dialogue can be de-emphasized.The casting was also great, besides Henson, Kieran Culkin is so charming (more so than his brother) that he pulls off the hard job of making someone so physically vulnerable also so tough and gutsy. Sharon stone surprised me in that she played the role well, but overall her glamour was wrong for the role, the grandparents are good but those are small roles. Gillian Anderson is unrecognizable but her role and her motives are also not well documented. This vagueness concerning adults is exemplified in Kenny Kane who was played woodenly.  But it works cause the movie is about max and Kane and their world not the adults. Like all good teen movies, the adult world is declared separate and pushed away in favor of the child's view.

Together, they form an entity better than the sum of their parts, each growing from their experiences questing together.Very emotional, kind, and entertaining, this movie also teaches what so few movies have ever done with any effort.  Honor.  In leading a just and true life, seeking noble causes to fight for and needy people to defend.  Where courage and excitement are your rewards and the armor you put on and the sword you fight with are a part of your soul and spirit.Perhaps that is why I loved this movie so much, is that it was able to convey that message of honor and justice so well and without slamming it down the throat of the audience.  Truly a wonderful message, and one I know will help one or two kids lead happier, better lives.I'm going to buy this movie for my kids...just in case no other movie like this one is around when they grow up.10/10!

Eldon Henson and Kiernan Culkin(who shows signs of being much more talented than his more famous brother) are both excellent as the two heroes of the story, and for the most part, director Peter Chelsom avoids easy sentiment.  James Gandolfini overplays a bit, and Gillian Anderson relies too much on screwing up her face in playing a biker chick, but the other adults(Gena Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton, and Sharon Stone) acquit themselves well.  They don't have big parts, but they understand the movie belongs to the kids, and they don't get in their way.

And when the film was announced I waited and waited for a long 10 months from its announcement to its release to go see The Mighty and I was shocked. This movie was hardly advertised! And yet it was so good! The Mighty is about Max and Kevin A.K.A Freak. Freak and Max met each other in a reading class (in the book it was in Pre-school) and they became great friends going on quests such as running from Blade and his gang of thugs and fishing a purse out of a storm drain. Together they form an amazing relationship which puts you in either Freak or Max's shoes. The movie is just incredible and has to be the sleeper hit of 1998 even though it will never crack into 100 million dollar sales. The Mighty is a well done film, see it, you'll thank me.

On the surface, it may seem somewhat similar in concept and themes to Simon Birch. Both films concern the friendship of two adolescent boys who are outsiders, with one of whom possessing some sort of medical condition. Together, a diminutive brain and a husky brawn team to form Freak the Mighty, with the smaller lad perched upon the larger's shoulders. They bond over the ideal of chivalric knights and embark on noble quests with their imaginations revolving around the King Arthur mythos. The movie generates genuine emotions and doesn't resort to the trickery employed by mundane Hollywood-ized stories (see Simon Birch). The situations aren't played for cheap laughs, and the film takes a turn into darker territory when one character's convict father shows up, threatening dire circumstances. All of the leads give above-the -mark performances, especially the two younger actors. Kieran Culkin displays more range in this one part than in his elder sibling Macaulay's entire career. Sharon Stone is superb in a winning, heartfelt appearance. Fans of The X-Files may want to tune in to see Gillian Anderson in a brief role that is about as far as Agent Scully as one can be. Trevor Jones contributes an inspiring score that reflects a Celtic-influenced medieval motif that mixes with the urban realities of modern day Cincinnati, Ohio. This is a smart and thoughtful film that, while containing some deeply sad moments, is no tear-jerker. It manages several touches of humor including a very amusing Star Trek reference.

Or was Miramax angling from the start to throw an Oscar-worthy contender into the role of the mother and market the film as a best-supporting-actress vehicle?  It's only too bad that all the other supporting characters, played to perfection by James Gandolfini, Jillian Anderson, Harry Dean Stanton, and most especially Gena Rowlands, were simply not fleshed out enough in the script to merit award status.  I was thoroughly impressed with the child actors, whose names should have received top billing.  Meatloaf, as always, is fun to watch.But acting aside, this film was sheer crap, wrought with cliche, sentimentality, and oh-so-pretty music to disguise the fact that this is a really lame story, re-told ad nauseum, which had nothing new to offer. Loved the music!...  From now on when anyone tells me they loved the music from a movie I will refuse to watch it.  Directors tend to use the musical score as a crutch to paint over their mistakes.  When the entire score is THAT good, clue into the fact that he's blowing smoke in your eyes to hide the inherent flaw of the movie that the story itself, from beginning to end, is flawed.7-out-of-10, for acting alone.

I haven't seen so many cliche's and lame tries to make you really ...feel ...something, since 'Rudy'. A very good example is the scene where they are playing basketball, and Max holds Freak on his shoulders, allowing him to dunk. Gawk!But many thanks to Gillian Anderson for her extremely unconvincing and funny acting as some southern tramp. The only light point of the film.So in summation Yet another lame movie which message is that you shouldn't discriminate against people that are different. A good message, but since I already knew that, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with an IQ higher than their shoe-size.

Not saints, or evil, or necessarily compensated by some genius, they are just ordinary people trying to work their way through their problems.  I wanted to like The Mighty for an honest portrayal of misfits finding their way, but ended up resenting the noble extraordinary dying child as a new Hollywood archetype.  I still gave the film a 9 out of 10, but hope the film industry can develop new stories that avoid this theme. Passion Fish and Lorenzo's Oil explored the challenge of coping for those who lost their physical well being, it shouldn't be that difficult to portray the mundane humanity of those who take their physical problems for granted.  Every individual finds his or her own way to relate to the world. So long as films describe the physically challenged as special rather than merely human they are still classifying them as freaks/genies and failing to tell the simple truth.

Was it the scene where Kevin discovers that can ride Max like a horse just in time to get away from the bullies (which is a blatant ripoff of Masterblaster from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, by the way), or the scene in the gym where they dunk the basketball (and this one is done in slow motion!!!).  God, this movie made me want to vomit!  I don't understand how any of this could seem believable, or even entertaining.  Kieran Culkin came across as a patronizing little rat, and Elden Ratcliff managed to turn Max into a two-dimensional mongoloid.  Not that I think acting could have saved this rubbish.  This story was terrible the day Charles Leavitt finished the claptrap script.  I will say this Sharon Stone and Gillian Anderson managed to shine through this terrible film with good performances, but that didn't change my opinion of the movie.  Rarely do I dislike a film this much. Watch it if you want a good laugh, or an excuse for bulemia.

I thought I would see an honest human drama but all I've got was the feeling of being manipulated all the time.

Guess what? They'll meet and help each other to overcome their deficiencies.The only difference between this movie and lots of others in the same (low) range is the cast. They're all very good. Gillian Anderson was a nice surprise! Sharon Stone had already shown her acting skills in Casino and here she did a correct work in a small - but made-to-fit - role. The boys (Kieran Culkin and Elden Ratliff) are all right and so are the older ones (Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton). It's a shame that a cast like this is not enough.

The book is beautiful as it focuses on the friendship between Kevin and Max that was initially borne out of necessity, and eventually cemented by their unspoken empathy for one another.This film fails to capture that dynamic, which ultimately is essential for the viewer's attachment to the perils of the plot that binds the two juvenile heroes together.What surprises me are the A-List actors who signed onto the film whose well documented brilliance was diluted and inconsequential; mere sections of a story, blandly brushed by the Hollywood machine of faceless screenwriters and a director acquiescing to a script that faintly resembles the original story that has inspired many before it.

Big T is in this picture, as is Sharon Stone. Both play excellent supporting roles, but the focus is not on them, but on two kids and the drama of how an overgrown hulk and a smart squirt on crutches team us to overcome the bad guys and be pals for lifetime is exceptional and real. If you like true life stories about real kids --- not Hollywood style smart mouths, it's hard to imagine a better recent film.One of the kids is played by Mccauley Calkin's kid brother and it just brings to mind how Mack's real life never-married parents brought 7 kids into the world, apparently raised with no values and bled dry. Mack Calkin had no talent to speak of when he was luckily tossed into the Home Alone series. With that and Columbia's charmless My Girl Mack (or his unmarried child-breeding parents) grabbed up $17 million and Mack was burned out at age 14. Then he gets involved with Michael Jackson; but before that happened the parents are hawking the younger kids trading off Mack's star power. Gag me, please.A $17 million income by age 14 might be nice, but is no guarantee of a full life. Of all the rotten parents in Hollywood, one might be hard pressed to name worse than those of Drew Barrymore, Maccauly Calkin or Winona Ryder. Drew bottomed-out by age 12 and raised herself up on her own mettle; Winona had LSD guru Timothy Leary as a godparent and is still clueless about her shoplifting downfall, then there's the Calkin kids. God help them.

Other than that, this movie has good intentions and a great story. However, there were a few scenes that just felt overly tense, such as when--possible spoilers--Kevin begins choking on his food and loses consciousness, as well as the scene where Loretta is strangled (but not killed), which is otherwise understandable. This seemingly is supposed to be a family-friendly film, but with these scenes the filmmakers make it look more like a thriller. If the filmmakers had not done this, I believe this film could very easily have been given a PG rating. -6 stars for the tension.
