Set in the 70's (featuring many cool 70's haircuts) in small town Georgia, the story focuses on Francis, a 14-year-old dreamer and troublemaker. He and his pals, Tim, Wade, and Joey cope with life under the oppressive rule of one-legged nun Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster) at the Puritan Christian high school they're unfortunate enough to attend. One of their methods of escape is the 'The Atomic Trinity' comic book. Each of them have their own character with superpowers (such as The Muscle, Captain Asskicker and Skeleton Boy), battling against the tyrannical regime of Nunzilla/Pegleg (a gross caricature of Sister Assumpta). These fantasy stories make up the terrific animated sequences of the film. The cool thing is that they are not so totally removed from the reality of Francis, Tim, Wade and Joey.The boys soon find their way into a lot of trouble though. After stealing the school's nun statue mascot the quartet plan to steal a cougar from the zoo and put in Sister Assumpta's office. A mad plan yes, but their determination and invention behind it is very clever.Some scenes of the film are very emotional, so if you have soft spot you'll find it tough to get through the scene where Tim finds a dying dog by the side of the road or Francis reading a poem at the funeral.Francis' relationship with Margie (the very cute Jenna Malone) also takes many curious and unique turns. The scene with the ghost watching them sleep was pleasingly weird. Taken from the one and only book (posthumously) by Chris Fuhrman (a book I must get as soon as I see), The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is attractively shot, wonderfully acted and definitely worth getting.The DVD is in 1.851 widescreen (strangely non-anamorphic, though the region 2 version is) with Dolby 5.1 sound and a mild bunch of extras.

Francis has a crush on Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), who has a dramatic secret in her life. They like to write a comic book called 'The Atomic Trinity' and all of them have an alter-ego in their superheroes Brakken (Francis), The Muscle/Skeleton Boy later (Tim), Captain Asskicker (Wade) and Major Screw (Joey), with Sorcerella (Margie) joining them later. Francis uses to fantasize reality with the fantastic situations the heroes face against the evil Nunzilla/Pegleg, a dark caricature of Sister Assumpta. The group plots an evil prank against Sister Assumpta, with tragic consequences.The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys is a surprisingly great original coming to age movie, one of the best I have ever seen in my life. The group of friends recalled me 1986 Stand by Me or part of 1981 Four Friends and the dramatic situation recalled somehow 1999 The Virgin Suicides. The screenplay, alternating animation with film, is great the boys escape and fantasize reality through their alter egos. The performance of the young cast is also excellent. Jodie Foster, as the severe teacher, and Vincent D'Onofrio, as Father Casey, magnificently complete this wonderful cast. I could never imagine Jodie Foster in such role. I highly recommend this great movie, much unknown here in Brazil.

I looked at it and it seemed like it would be an o.k. way to kill two hours. There was really nothing else in the videostore, so I decided to rent it. Boy, am I glad I did. I really appreciated the movie and related to it, after all I do go to a Catholic High School. 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' is actually a great coming-of-age tale set in the Catholic school setting of the 1970s. Just by reading the title I thought it was about pedophile Catholic priests or something, but it's really about two friends who are the altar boys at their church/school and their adventures as they discover what's life is all about... or their interpretation of it.The two boys in 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' are Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch - The Girl Next Door, The Emperor's Club) and Michael Sullivan (Kieran Culkin - Igby Goes Down, Home Alone). They are two fifteen year old rebels that have a passion for comics and writing and illustrating their own. They despise their tough-as-nails and strict one-legged Catholic nun school teacher, Sister Assumpta (played by Two Time Academy Award Winner Jodie Foster - The Accused, The Silence of the Lambs). The two boys make themselves their own creative superheroes in their comic and have Sister Assumpta be the evil motorcycle peddling nun from hell that the two superheroes battle, along with the boys' other two friends who provide superheroes for their comic too. The film switches from real-life to the creative comic book setting during conflicts in the story, and I think that it's done very stylish and neat. The two boys rebel against their teacher and misbehave in front of her constantly, especially Michael (Culkin) who drives her absolutely nuts. The boys rebel by doing other things that the nun doesn't know about like, drink, smoke pot and steal and damage church property. The film contains some funny moments, and as the story unfolds Francis (Hirsch) becomes interested in the girl who lives next door to him Margie (Jena Malone - Saved!, Cold Mountain), a cool, nice, beautiful and independent girl with a deep and dark secret that challenges Francis. I won't give it away though.There are many great aspects to this film. Most notably is the acting. Emile Hirsch is nothing short of incredible as the genuine misfit Francis and Jena Malone is equally as good as the sweet yet complex Margie. Jodie Foster is hysterical and always a pleasure to watch as the uptight Catholic school nun and 'Law & Order Criminal Intent's' Vincent D'Onofrio has a somewhat small role as an interesting Catholic school priest who smokes like a chimney. The stand-out of the film however is Kieran Culkin. He is definitely the most talented performer in his family, and he gives an astounding performance as Michael Sullivan that puts him on the top of the list of the best child actors working in Hollywood currently. Culkin gave an equally amazing performance in Burr Steer's neurotic and darkly hilarious film debut 'Igby Goes Down' which was released the same year as 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'. Peter Care does a fabulous job with this, his feature film debut, and the valley's Todd MacFarlane (creator of Spawn) provides the comic book illustration for the animated scenes. All in all this is a great coming-of-age movie, with a lot of heart and intelligence. It has some flaws like dragging a little towards the beginning, being a little unclear towards the end and having some freaky and unnecessary ghost sequence towards the middle of the film. I'd recommend this to anyone who attends Catholic High School because it is a great movie but it's also something you could relate to. Next time you are at the videostore and can't find anything to watch, maybe pick up 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'. Chances are you won't regret it.

(spoilers)","Date":"4 August 2004","Score":"13 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys is based on the bildungsroman novel by Chris Furhman, who, unfortunately died of cancer during the revision of his novel, which was later published by a friend. Judging by the last chapter (although it is narrated from the first person point of view of Francis Doyle), I assume that the novel is based on Fuhrman's own actual childhood experiences and developed into a comic book of the same title. Unfortunately, while both the novel and the movie are quite good, the movie lacks some of the structure as well as more significant, yet controversial images than does the film (for obvious reasons on this latter point--they are catering to younger audiences and pre-teen sex doesn't go over well with your always alert conservative censors). Likewise, the novel, which is set in Savannah circa 1970 and deals with heated issues of racism (and our characters recognition of the fallacies of generalization). It was risqu√© enough to develop a movie which contains among its characters a young school girl who has not only engaged in an incestial relationship, but also attempted suicide. This is the story of four boys in at Blessed Heart, a Catholic School for Boys. Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) are figures that model Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn (although Francis is ruled by considerably fewer rules than Tom's Aunt Polly reserved for her own boy). Tim Sullivan is the inspiration for the gang, living the credo that danger and trouble is their only defense against boredom. Partly, their only defense against the absurd rules of society and the meaningless ritual of adults (our character Tim is of the Holden Caufield variety), is a comic book (The Atomic Trinity) which the friends create, which parallels their various coming-of-age experiences with pranks and first love and so forth. Part of the screen time is shared with animated scenes of our comic book heroes at work. Francis and Tim seem to differ on their goals, however. For Tim, his goal is the revolt against Sister Assumpta (Jodi Foster) who embodies most of the absurd rules as head of the Catholic School. For example, she is the one who confiscates Tim's copy of a book by William Blake (I think it was called 'The Creation'), and as such, is seen as an unruly censor. Tim is out to defy that absurdity. His character is the bildungsromane type more Francis. His character is much smarter, much more aware of his surroundings. But sadly, it is all he is focused on. As you see in the comic book scenes, he is the hero who is only concerned with bringing down the flaming skull, which is actually Sister Assumpta. Blessed Heart represents everything finds wrong with the world around him.Francis, too, may be disgusted with the hypocrisy of the Catholic teachings and Blessed Heart in general, but his disgust with the world and likewise his concern is Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), his first true love. Flynn is an utterly sad character in a film where you might just expect boyhood pranks on unsuspecting authority. Flynn is a young quiet girl who attempted to kill herself because she thought she was going crazy and hated herself for an incestial relationship she carried on with her brother. Francis, through his real actions and through his comic book hero image, tries to rescue the frail Margie Flynn. She is the girl he is forever in love with, and her frailty may in part be part of the oppression he sees (like Tim). They don't tell much about her parents or brother in the movie, but in the novel, they are divorced and Donnie Flynn is a real sadistic creep, at least towards Francis and the other boys. Margie Flynn is really a difficult character to endure, particularly for younger audiences, considering the circumstances. The story starts out like another 'Heaven Help Us' type (only more intellectual and much funnier) of Catholic School boys run amuck, but the introduction of Margie's character puts a weird spin about things. I'm not sure that they developed her character enough for this movie, although much of the focus within the Flynn-Doyle relationship was on Francis and not really Margie. Maybe if Emile Hirsch didn't always act so spaced out all the time, this aspect of the story might've been more effective. Meanwhile, when the four boys's comic book is confiscated by Sister Assumpta, the boys (Tim in particular) get the idea that they're going to get retaliation on Blessed Heart and, in particular, Sister Assumpta (amongst all other things that they think need revolting against in that William Blake revolutionary sense that Tim abides by) by releasing a panther (in the novel, it was just a bobcat) into the school. By doing so, they would be declared the local legends of danger. This is going to be their mark of importance. This is when each of the boys start questioning their loyalty to this unofficial pact of a crusade for danger. Francis and Tim (the closet of the four friends), too, start questioning just how far they're willing to go because, their idea of importance changes. For Tim, it's all or nothing. For Francis, he's second guessing just how easy (and necessary) such a prank would be and also, is meanwhile, wrapped up in his own little world with Margie Flynn.This is one of those coming-of-age films with young characters who have a heightened sense of self-awareness and such in the style of 'Stand by Me' and hell, even 'Fandango' and so forth. It's funny and it's sad. Overall, it's a pretty good movie worth catching. Live dangerously!

It doesn't but there are some effective moments and performances that keep this from being a total disappointment. Story takes place in the 1970's at a Catholic school called St. Agatha's and four young boys are the central characters. Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) are best friends along with Wade (Jake Richardson) and Joey (Tyler Long) and the four of them pull preposterous pranks against their school and also collaborate on a comic book story that is called The Atomic Trinity. At school they are constantly being criticized by Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster) who is a very strict nun and one night they decide to steal a statue from the school and instantly they are suspected of the crime. Francis starts to date Margie Flynn (Jena Malone) and they get along very well until she confides in him a very dark secret.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Margie tells Francis that she had an incestuous relationship with her brother and now he is unsure about how to continue dating her. He asks Father Casey (Vincent D'Onofrio) for some advice but doesn't get the answer that he is seeking. Meanwhile, Tim has devised a plan on tranquilizing a cougar and putting into Sister Assumpta's room but during this prank something horrible occurs.This film is directed by Peter Care who has directed many music video's but this is his first effort with anything resembling a budget. Care does an adequate job of telling this story but the script lacks conviction in both plot and character development. Culkin is the king of all pranks and clearly doesn't take what is taught to him in school seriously but in one scene while carrying a dying dog he starts to yell about this animal not being cared for. This reveals a dark part of his persona but the script never dwells into it and we are left wondering about this part of him. The part of the plot about Malone and her brother seems a bit overwrought for the mood and tone and I never had a sense of what this film was trying to say. A film like American Graffiti could balance both comedy and drama but one of the flaws here is that this film does not do that well at all. Both Hirsch and Culkin are solid and Malone continues to show great promise but the script lacks focus with their roles in correlation with the rest of the film. Foster for the most part plays her part one dimensionally and uninspired and seems to just go along with what was written for her without developing the character for her own. The only originality comes from the film balancing both the live action and the animated sequences and it does a fairly good job of reflecting their inner most fantasies through their comic book stories. The films comedy isn't as humorous as Heaven Help Us and it also doesn't possess the dark tone and edge of The Devil's Playground. This film attempts an emotional ending but with the lack of focus and conviction in the story it doesn't occur.

The good news is, this coming-of-age tale (revolving around the themes of first love and adolescent mischief) remains faithful to its source, while expanding (successfully, I think) upon what was written in the book.  This worked very well in Terry Zwigoff's Ghost World, but there are times in The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys where the tone threatens to go from comedy-drama, to flat-out drama, to flat-out comedy.  It always manages to regain its balance, though.  The story revolves around Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin, who's very good), altar boys with a comic-book fixation and a resentment of authority (represented here by Jodie Foster's peg-legged Mother Superior); also on hand is Francis' love interest, Margie (Jena Malone), who reveals herself to be a complicated, tragic figure.As far as revisiting adolescence is concerned, The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys is accurate, funny, and even sad.  However, it suffers from an over-emphasis on close-ups during key dramatic scenes, and the lead performance of Emile Hirsch is surprisingly weak (when he emotes, it looks exaggerated and fake).

The film centers around the hijinks of these characters, then tries to throw in some character development that generally go absolutely nowhere.Most of the film is spent planning a prank on the Sister that goes awry, but after awhile it becomes so boring that when the climax of the film arrived I didn't remotely care. 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' has been praised for its creativity and the mixed genres, (the film turns into a Todd McFarlane produced form of anime at times) but even these moments were just plain boring. Jodie Foster, as always, is wonderful in the film, but despite the fact that she is supposedly the evil nemesis, she has an aggregate screen time of perhaps ten minutes, so there wasn't enough of her to truly enjoy.Generally, films that deal with topics such as incest, ghosts, and untamed youth are at least thought-provoking, but 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' didn't provoke anything in me but boredom. 'Coming of age' films have been done many times before, but they can still be effective if done well.

The plan, of course, goes awry. What is interesting in this film-- besides watching Culkin, Hirsch and Foster working their usual magic-- is the complexity of theme going on behind the adolescent antics. The film looks at the purpose of fantasy, the meaning of faith, the dangers of testing boundaries, the unpleasantness of unfinished business, the nature of God and the question of how one interprets His authority. The question of original sin-- never clumsily and straightforwardly stated-- permeates the film, from Margie's awful revelations to Tim's mischief. The film's real genius is its ability to play with obviously religious ideas without really doing any preaching.Behind all this, of course, is the Viet Nam war. As America loses its post-WWII innocence at the end of the 1960s, and as the flower-power generation realises that breaking the boundaries that authority sets ultimately breaks much more, so the boys learn what happens when people want to take God's power.

In mid-1970s Savannah, two bright but rebellious boys, Francis Doyle and Tim Sullivan, fight boredom, hormones and harsh teachers as they struggle to find something meaningful beyond the walls of their parish school. Francis, an exceptional artist whose imaginative forays into a fictional universe of good and evil fill his notebooks with comic-book imagery, creates a netherworld of superhero alter egos for the two boys. When the ultra-strict Sister Assumpta seizes their artwork one day, the boys embark upon an obsessed trail of revenge that ultimately changes their lives. Roger Ebert wrote Another hint of the overachieving screenplay is the running theme of the boys' fascination with William Blake's books Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience. I can believe that boys of this age could admire Blake, but not these boys. And I cannot believe that Sister Assumpta would consider Blake a danger. What we sense here is the writer, Jeff Stockwell, sneaking in material he likes even though it doesn't pay its way. (There's one other cultural reference in the movie, unless I'm seeing it where none was intended Early in the film, the boys blow up a telephone pole in order to calculate when it will fall, and they stand just inches into the safe zone. I was reminded of Buster Keaton, standing so that when a wall fell on him, he was in the exact outline of an open window.) The movie has qualities that cannot be denied. Jena Malone (Donnie Darko, Life as a House) has a solemnity and self-knowledge that seems almost to stand outside the film. She represents the gathering weather of adulthood. The boys are fresh and enthusiastic, and we remember how kids can share passionate enthusiasms; the animated sequences perfectly capture the energy of their imaginary comic book. Vincent D'Onofrio muses through the film on his own wavelength, making of Father Casey a man who means well but has little idea what meaning well would consist of. If the film had been less extreme in the adventures of its heroes, more willing to settle for plausible forms of rebellion, that might have worked.

It will remain one of the more curious choices for Jodie Foster, cast as a hard-line nun, but perhaps this is explained by the fact that she also co-produced. Well acted by all the young cast though and worth a look. "},{"Title":"Whoa!","Date":"23 October 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Man, this film caught me off guard!

Emile Hirsch, I believe, did a great job and will be a very strong actor for a long time. The ending caught me off guard and it had me in its grip the whole way to it. The only thing I didn't care for was the comic book cut scenes thrown into the movie. I understood them and why they were there, but didn't think they fit the movie.

It is an emotionally realistic depiction of adolescence (however unlikely some elements of the plot might be) and a disturbing critique of Catholicism (in particular) and authority (in general). Kudos especially to Jena Malone for her performance, which was disquietingly honest. Jodie Foster and Vincent D'Onofrio don't have much screen time, but their performances are memorable (especially his, I thought). The one major flaw of the film is that the animated sequences are rendered in a style that is anachronistically too modern, in a film that otherwise does an excellent job of recreating its historical period. I grew-up during this time period, and the film aroused vivid memories for me (I wouldn't exactly call it nostalgia, because not all of the memories were pleasant). If you see this film and enjoy it, you might also want to have a look at The Ice Storm (another fine period study) and Heaven Help Us (for more Catholic-school angst).

When I first saw this I was 15-years-old and let me tell you it really does capture what the essence of being a coming of age teen is like. The two main characters, Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) really capture the realism of going through the changes that happen around the era of 13-16 years of age. The opening of them doing their math homework is so funny and refreshing. I like how the film captured real problems that adolescents go through. Not the sh*t that other teen movies portray. This film shows how Francis is ready to grow up and go beyond things like stealing a statue, he wants a girlfriend and just wants to grow up. While Tim is just not maturing fast enough, their friendship deff goes through some rough patches.This film is about two boys around the age of 14. They go to a Catholic School and it takes place somewhere in the 70s in the South. The two boys Tim and Francis are best friends. This film chronicles the ups and downs of their friendship and things they have to go through. Francis becomes infatuated with a girl Margie Flynn (Jena Malone). He and Margie become close and this is hurting Tim to watch his friend grow. Tim is still into playing dumb pranks and not wanting to really grow up. Their friendship goes through many trials and tribulations. Tim really despises their teacher Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster). His goal in life is to get the one legged b*tch. Francis goes along with Tims plan to destroy the nun, but doesn't really care. Throughout this film Francis makes drawings for a comic book they have called The Atomic Trinity these drawings he makes are really the emotions and things his is thinking/feeling. Francis later has to deal with a dark secret from his girlfriend Margie, and he realizes that even this secret is too much for him. He and Tim are slowly drifting apart...all while Tim is also feeling hurt on the inside which he lets out with all of his trouble making. There is a very powerful scene when Tim finds a dying dog, which forshadows the ending. I do not want to give too much away about this film. All i can say is this is one powerful mind blowing coming of age story. Please go out and rent this!!

It sticks true to the formula, but pushes the envelope at the same time.What's unique about this film is that it forces its audience to grow with the main character, Francis Doyle.  At the beginning of the film, Francis lives in a pretty carefree world of going to Catholic school and hanging out with his friends, and that is the world that the audience lives in for the first 20 minutes or so.  It looks like kid stuff, but don't be fooled--there's some real darkness and depth just around the corner.  Francis discovers about life, death, love, and pain, and all these revelations surprise the audience just as much as they surprise Francis.Live action in the movie is interposed with the comic book adventures of Brakken and the Muscle, the superheroes who are Francis and his friend Tim's alter egos.  It's a wonderful addition, adding a physical journey to Francis's confusing emotional journey.All in all, a very competent film, made more so by wonderful performances from Kieran Culkin, Jena Malone, and Emile Hirsch.

The acting is excellent, sincere, and professionally done.  The story is amazing.  And the sense of humor is superb.  Anyone who enjoys the novels of John Irving will certainly enjoy this film.My only concern with it is that its sense of location was blurred from the book.  In the book, the story is set in Savannah, Georgia, in the mid-1970's.  Considering all the pranks and jokes that the boys perform, I think that the book's setting in the South is perfect.  In the film, the viewer must assume, based on the character's flat accents, that the story is set somewhere in the Midwest.The sense of intimacy between the boy protagonists is entirely believable; anyone who was a small-town boy during the 80's will appreciate the comic book motif that sews the main character's internal condition cleanly into the film's action.  In essence, the way that these boys relate to each other and the world is wholly believable.  It's how my friends and I, growing up in South Carolina, dealt with the confusion of puberty.Those who have thought that the stark, tragic ending was unbelievable evidently preferred boredom to trouble in their youth.  Reflecting back upon the acts of vandalism, trespassing, and inventive pranks that I and my childhood cohorts performed, there were many instances where one (or all) of us could have died violent, painful deaths as a result of lacking forethought.

Had Shapiro chosen to visualize that scene and skip the skin crawling make out one, it would have had a much more dramatic effect. Also, it would have enlightened many who have complained that the movie didn't justify Margie's revelations on incest with her brother. This movie leaves you aching for more character development, especially of that pertaining to Francis' ultra cool best friend, Tim Sullivan. Kieran Culkin does a nice job portraying Tim despite constant screen sharing with minor characters. He is the film's redeeming quality and reason worth to watch.

The film isn't perfect, though.  I found it hard to beleive some of the situations that the boys got themselves into, and the ending was a big disappointment.

"},{"Title":"Insightful Depiction of a Sensitive Juncture of Life","Date":"4 December 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Context is basically what separates one coming-of-age story from another, as well as the way it's presented; the filmmaker's ability to make that all important connection with the audience.  Due in no small part to some strong performances, `The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys,' directed by Peter Care, is a successful and worthwhile-- even significant-- addition to the genre.  Though it works within specific parameters (the subjects are students at a Catholic school), most importantly, the film taps deeply into the internal angst experienced by the individuals who are the focus of Care's incisive study, and the way in which their feelings are externalized in the film offers a satisfying examination of the human condition at a particularly sensitive juncture of life.Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) is fourteen and in the throes of that inescapable period of change through which we all must pass on the way to becoming who we are as adults.  A pupa encased in the cocoon of youth, Francis is straining against that protective shell, attempting to break through into manhood.  His family environment is strict, the routine of his life (which includes being an altar boy) is rigid, and puberty is having it's way with him.  Adding to his inner conflict, as well, is the fact that his best friend, Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin), is continually engaging in exploits that transcend mischief to the point of being outright foolish and dangerous; daring deeds in which Francis must necessarily take part, in keeping with their own established caste and as Tim's confrere in this business of probing life's eternal mysteries.  Not to mention, too, that Francis has discovered something else, quite on his own.  And her name is Margie Flynn (Jena Malone).Luckily (perhaps), Francis manages to vent his pent up frustrations and confusion creatively, through animation.  With his friends Joey and Wade (Tyler Long, Jake Richardson), he has created a comic book, `Atomic Trinity,' which features four outcast teenaged boys endowed with superpowers (Tim has been included as `editor').  And to channel their hormonal driven rebellion against authority and structure, they have chosen their teacher, Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster), as their target, for in their eyes she personifies all that is wrong with their world.  Assigning her the role of Source Of All That Is Bad, she emerges as `Nun-zilla' in their comic, this haven to which they can flee and momentarily escape the realities of a world they haven't as yet figured out.  What they don't realize is that Tim is about to involve them in a scheme which, if effected, is going to change their lives forever.  And that `safe haven' of theirs may soon be a thing of the past.Learning to navigate the rapids of life is no easy task, and director Care treats his subject accordingly, with a sensitive and serious rendering of the material (the screenplay was written by Jeff Stockwell and Michael Petroni, adapted from the book by Chris Fuhrman).  Care succeeds by avoiding the kind of embarrassing frivolity that is too often associated with a film of this nature.  He maintains credibility at every turn, making the story believable by keeping it on the stage of reality, rather than allowing it to wander into the theater of the absurd.  The way he presents the relationship between Francis and Margie, for instance, is entirely convincing in the way they tentatively explore their budding sexuality together, rather than lurching ahead with seemingly sudden and inexplicable knowledge and enlightenment.  Their discoveries come more from reaction than action, and the result is a very honest and genuine depiction of the situation.  And Care uses this approach consistently throughout the film, which goes far in making it a thoroughly thought provoking drama.As Francis, young Hirsch gives a commanding performance, exhibiting a maturity and grasp of the character that is far beyond his years.  There is a complexity to Francis that demands a tremendous emotional range to be convincing, and Hirsch delivers it all and then some, with a portrayal of astounding depth.  Here, in his motion picture debut, he emerges as one of the finest young actors in the business today.Jena Malone also makes a substantial impact with her acute portrayal of Margie, successfully conveying the tortured soul of this young girl who must endure a most distressing secret.  There are moments in which the pain derived from her inner turmoil is almost tangible; and that about sums up the quality of her performance here.Displaying yet another side of the coin is Kieran Culkin, who in Tim creates a character who, unlike the others, internalizes his adolescent discord while outwardly manifesting an almost aloof disdain for caution in all things.  We're given indications and a glimpse into the strife existing within his home and family, and it's enough to make us aware of the source of his discontent.  It's a solid performance, though he fails to make any real connection with the audience, most likely due to the fact that Tim is quite simply not an easy character to embrace.The most subtle and understated performance in the film is turned in by Jodie Foster, who though she lacks enough screen time to adequately develop her character nevertheless manages to succinctly reveal exactly who she is and what she's about.  She is stern, and obviously a disciplinarian; but though her methods may be too straightforward, even to the point of seeming malicious, she is not, and is far from being the monster `Nun-zilla' depicted in `Atomic Trinity.'  On the contrary, she has a good heart and sincerely wants only to instruct her students in ways that will lead them to a fulfilling life.  There is obviously more to Sister Assumpta's story, but the focus of the film must necessarily remain elsewhere, and we are left to infer what we may.A thoughtful, emotionally involving film, `The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' offers a viable perspective on the rigorous undertaking known as `growing up.'

The church and the school can't understand them, Sister Assumpta keeps a close eye on them, and they're suspected of every wrongdoing (rightly or not).  Worst of all, one girl, Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), draws Francis to the edges of the boys' club as his feelings for her start to cloud his loyalties to his band of brothers.There's nothing simple here.  Sister Assumpta isn't just a dragon lady out to get the boys because she hates children; she feels frustrated by her inability to connect with the boys.  Tim Sullivan isn't just the designer of mad plots (such as the key scheme to steal a panther from the zoo and unleash it on the Sister); he's a disaffected youth trying his hardest to deal with the realities of his life in the only way he knows how.  Francis Doyle isn't just a dreamer; he's a conflicted boy in the midst of exiting childhood for good and he knows it.  The comics he draws aren't just daydreams of a boy's mind, they're his own interpretation of the ways his life changes day by day.It's a textured tale that offers realistic interaction between the boys (Culkin and Hirsch turn in standout performances) and the girl (Malone in a very vulnerable supporting role).  To tie the film together, and weave the fantasy realm of the Atomic Trinity into the real-life world of the school grounds, director Peter Care adds in animation sequences that bring Francis' story to life.  Produced by Todd MacFarlane's studio (the same group that did the animated 'Spawn' for HBO), the boys' alter-egos reflect their flesh-and-blood counterparts, all the way to the bitter end.'Altar Boys' is a worthy effort, a tender reminiscence to the times in all boys' lives where they must make the journey from boyhood to manhood.  It's not just one step, either, it's a series of obstacles and challenges that daunt even the best of us.  This film is worth seeing, even for those of you who don't happen to be altar boys.

From the opening sequence, you get an in-depth look at the lives of the two primary characters, altar boys Tim Sullivan and Francis Doyle, (played by Kieran Culkin and Emile Hirsch, respectively),and their cutting down of the telephone pole early on perfectly introduced them to the audience, as well as really setting the tone for the movie as a whole.  Some have said this film doesn't really delve that far into their characters, and I'm not sure I can agree with that.  It certainly doesn't have one of those Hollywood characters come clean and reveal all their deep dark secrets sequences in it, but it deals well in subtlety, and gives more genuine hints as to what their lives are like.  The scene in which Tim's parents were arguing accomplished what it needed to accomplish, and without overdramatizing it at that; putting less attention on it makes their arguing seem like more of an everyday occurrence, and that is substantial.  Furthermore, the scene in which Tim and Francis find the wounded and dying dog on the side of the road certainly establishes a bit of Tim's character, at least to my mind.The animation sequences, for my money, were perfectly done, and fit in very nicely with the live action sequences, and really help the film in the long run.  Most importantly, they convey what the boys, especially Francis in particular, are feeling inside, and that again, is substantial.  In my opinion, it is an excellent film, and it is a very well-done film.  But, again, that is my opinion and only that. The DVD is most certainly excellent, with loads of special features, including deleted scenes, a featurette, interviews, and a lot more.  In my estimation, this film is outstanding, and should not be missed.

I'm not exactly sure why. Though it does have Jodie Foster who I like and I'm also partial to coming of age stories. I think it was literally only in Santa Barbara for one week and I wasn't able make it. So when it was release on DVD, I picked it up and I'm glad I did. Jodie Foster is good as always, but hers is really a minor role in this story that is centered around Emile Hirsh's character, Francis. The movie deals with his first Love, Margie Flynn played well by Jena Malone, who has some deeper issues that your typical teenage girl. And his partner in crime Tim, played by Kieran Culkin who is always planning some way to get into trouble. This story basically deals with your standard typical teen issues, but they are taken to the limits and things that your average teen probably doesn't have to consider. One of this movies big strengths is that the live action is interlaced with animated sequences by Todd McFarlane, who's arguably the best. Francis is an artist who fantasizes about becoming a comic book artist. The boys have created their own characters and these characters are brought to life in their thoughts and they are shown in the movie in the animated scenes. The mix of live action and animation blend together really well and are appropriately timed so that the film flows very well. I'm not sure if this film will appeal to everyone as much as it did to me, but it is a good quality story nonetheless.

From the looks of it a lot of people who've reviewed this film have totally missed its point. The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, the film, is about four 14-year-old boys (two main ones, two friends) and their comic-book altar egos (illustrated by Todd McFarlane and intertwined into the story) coping with life, love and adolescence in the wake of the 70s and Catholic School. The main boy, Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) discovers a new love interest in Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), who hides a dark secret. Tim Sullivan (Keiran Culkin), Francis's best friend, attempts to totally escape reality by engaging in a series of childish pranks geared towards p***ing-off their teacher, Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster), a one-legged nun (the other is prosthetic) who is actually trying to help the boys, but it seen as a cruel authority figure. All four boys illustrate a comic book involving their alter egos. Francis is Brakken, a green muscular giant who can mutate into veiny strands. Tim is The Muscle, a brown giant that looks entirely like it's made out of muscle. Tim later decides that there's too much flesh in the way and becomes Skeleton Boy, a hero made up entirely of bones. Wade and Joey, the other two friends, are Captain Asskicker and Major Screw (who screws and goes down on guys - literally!). Together, they form The Atomic Trinity (Joey doesn't really count), a group of comic-book misfits who don't belong anywhere. They band together to fight the forces of Nunzilla (or PegLeg), their alter ego bad-guy for Sister Assumpta. Margie Flynn is incorporated as Sorcerella, a dethroned princess who must save her kingdom from the clutches of Nunzilla and her clan. As the real-life story moves along, so does the comic story. I do not want to tell what happens, but you'll get a major lesson the poetry of William Blake, the importance of true friendship and the need for forgiveness. This is more than just a coming-of-age story - it's a coming-of-LIFE story. 10 out of 10. P.S. - if you read the book, this take on it is basically the same, the story has some major differences as well, which do, however, reflect the messages conveyed in the book. If you're open-minded and able to interpret situations from more than just one angle, you'll have a great time viewing this cinematic gem..

The performances are all just right, especially the three young leads. Kieren Culkin, Emile Hirsch, and Jenna Malone are all actors to keep an eye on... in fact I'd nominate all three for Oscars if I could. The film is a coming of age story that reminds me a lot of Rob Reiner's highly regarded Stand By Me in the way it evokes an era (the 70's) and the feeling of adolescent bonding. I like this film even more, and that's saying a lot. The kicker with this movie is the animated sequences which are interspersed with the live action. Much like the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, the animated fantasy sequences serve to illuminate the main character's real life dreams and dilemnas, and the animation is very lively and well done. By the way, the title has nothing to do with the current problems being experienced by the Catholic church, but rather refers to the characters' own sense of adventure. This film may not be for everyone - it's a bit raw in places - but the visual poetry and great performances all hang together to make it (for me anyway) one of the year's best films.

The real main character, who I think should have gotten first billing,  was the boy who played Doyle.  He actually showed some maturity at points and a good heart, so I found him bearable.  Personally, I'm with Nunzilla -- I find boys vile -- so I may be biased.  This made me super-glad to be born a girl, not having to deal with penis angst.  Basically, this was a truly unromanticized version of what I imagine boys lives must be like. and I think that's admirable in a film.  Also, it's set around what I think is the early 70s in a small town, and I haven't seen a movie lately which had this as a setting so that was refreshing.  They drank their soda (mixed with alcohol) out of the old-fashioned steel cans.  I just don't know what else to say about the film.  Oh!  The animation, super-hero parts juxtaposed with the storyline, sort of a fantasy of these young boys of what they would do if they had more power or were more grown or were super-heroes in the comics -- that was really well-done and interesting.

Tim and Francis Kieran Calkin and Emile Hirsch, respectivley are teen boys seeking outlets for their raging hormones and creative minds.  This isn't likely to happen in school under the watchful eye of Father Casey Vincent D'Onofrio and Sister Assumpta Jodie Foster; structure and discipline are the watchwords at St. Agatha's.  The boys, and their friends, escape reality by creating the Atomic Trinity comic book of `super hero's' living violent and sensual sexual adventures.  Their real life antagonists the Priest and Nun are featured in this fantasy, and it becomes the boy's downfall when the book falls into the wrong hands.  Meanwhile, in the real world Marie Jena Malone shares a secret with Francis; who shares it with others.  The plot thickens and our teen super heroes escalate their misdeeds, to their own detriment.   Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys has a ton of themes and issues on its plate, only some of which are brought to closure.  This is one of those movies that may suffer because it's constrained by the facts and the writers are loath to take liberties with their labor of love.  The specific events, in the aggregate, may stretch your imagination unless you lived your childhood in the very fast lane.  None the less, you don't have to be an alumnus of the St. Somewhere school to appreciate and be entertained by the story.  The yarn could easily be a light comedy, but there's serious stuff in the air, and that's what this slice of life is really about.  The filmmakers cleverly intersperse cartoon clips as windows to the boy's minds; that may or may not be your idea of clever filmmaking, but it works here. Jody Foster produces this film and is basically its patron saint.  She's also clever enough to play second chair to the young cast, particularly Hirsch and Malone, who deliver stunning and grownup performances.

For the guy who wondered in his review about Tim and Francis' home lives, let's just say that Francis' parents are WAY more disfunctional in the book than in the movie. Even with the parents' virtual absence from the movie, there are still great momemts that were more or less transferred from book to screen the scene in Margie's bedroom(although a bit more explicit in the book);Tim and Francis' finding the dying dog by the highway and Tim's subsequent soliloqy; the fateful journey into the wildlife preserve.

Actually it's rather unfair to clump THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS along with such fare as the American Pie movies and others of that ilk . Although it shares with those films an affinity for adolescent sexual boasting and a preponderance of scatological verbiage , this new picture has bigger things on its mind. Set in a small southern town circa 1970's , the story centers on a group of Catholic school boys who spend their off school hours developing an elaborate cartoon scrapbook of super heroes that intentionally mimic counterparts in real life , mainly the Catholic high school's principal , Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster) , and Father Casey (Vincent D'Onofrio), the parish priest . The boys are enthusiastic young artists, and their artistic fervor creates Sister Assumpta's menacing alter ego, a motorcycle bound , wraith - like nun who dominates their sketch book,  The Atomic Trinity  . This imagined cartoon world at times intrudes on the live action movie itself, as if the boys' collective effort morphs into full fledged fantasy. These well executed animated sequences, supervised by Spawn creator Tod McFarlane, prove to be an interesting diversion up to a point, but in the end seems to be a good idea run amok. It's the only misfire in an otherwise excellent production. Director Peter Care does a great job of depicting the bravado and awkwardness of adolescence ; his young actors are as naturalistic a bunch of kids as one could imagine. Into this mix is the seemingly generic teen romance involving two best friends and the pretty Margie Flynn (Jenna Malone), a young girl haunted by a deep, dark secret. When Margie divulges her story to one of the boys in a moment of trust, this movie becomes unexpectedly painful and moving. The title of this film is something of a misnomer  yes, some of the kids are altar boys and there is a brief scene of the boys serving Mass, but for a movie with Catholicism as a backdrop, the religiosity is treated with a deft hand. The one major voice of guilt and sin is given to Jodie Foster's austere Sister Assumpta, a woman whose harsh exterior belies a compassionate woman underneath. A diminutive but formidable figure swathed in black veil and starched collar, Sister wears a prosthetic limb, and is rudely called Peg-Leg behind her back. This could easily have been a situation for caricature but Foster brings a fierce intelligence and understanding to the role. Foster has never given anything less than a good performance, and this is one of her best A counterpoint to Sister Assumpta is Father Casey, the undemonstrative, chain - smoking pastor who pretty much leaves the disciplinary duties to Sister but leavens things a bit with gentle warnings. The scene where they peruse the boys' cartoon handiwork is priceless.As with past coming of age and loss of innocence movies, THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS serves up scenes of humiliating jokes and reckless pranks, but in this movie there is an unexpected twist. Moments of real tenderness fight their way to the surface, and don't be surprised if you find yourself wiping away a tear or two at film's end.

TODD McFARLANE's animation works very well and blends in beautifully in PETER CARE's visual and narrative concept (which makes it hard to believe he's a first-timer). JODIE FOSTER is as great as ever playing Sister Assumpta, a bitter nun with a wooden leg; she is disgusted with anything unholy, sacrilegious, or blasphemous that could possibly happen at the Catholic school she teaches, always on a quest (or crusade) looking out for potential sinners who must be punished. Whereas VINCENT D'ONOFRIO plays Father Casey, the more or less moderate Catholic priest who still has enough empathy towards his students to realize that boys will be boys, mischief or not. D'ONOFRIO is as good as ever, he is simply one of those actors who could not give a bad performance even if their lives depended on it.But basically the film is about, well, the lives of the altar boys (and Margie Flynn, the object of one altar boy's affection). EMILE HIRSCH and JENA MALONE do a fine job, convincing and believable, but it is KIERAN CULKIN who really shines as Tim Sullivan, the mischievous, charismatic, and self-confident leader of the teenage gang who, on the other hand, is very troubled and deeply hurt ('cause of his disfunctional family - to say the least). He delivers one of the finest, most mature, and most subtle performances by an actor of his generation I have seen in a long time. It takes great skill to underplay his part the way he did and yet being passionate about his plans and aims at the same time. I see a great actor in him coming in future years!It is too sad that ALTAR BOYS had not been released theatrically somewhere in the year 2001 because it has some career-defining performances in it and could probably had become a serious Oscar contender.

I was less pleased when I actually saw the movie.There are many examples I could give, but I'll stick with the most basic. For one, the feel of the school was all wrong. While the book perfectly captured the culture of rebellious teenagers resisting authority in an old-school Catholic environment, the movie didn't even come close. One gets the impression that the filmmakers had no personal experience in that environment and copied ideas they'd seen in other movies.Suprisingly, another big problem was Jodie Foster. While she is one of the best actors of her generation, she is woefully miscast as the evil nun. (I know evil nuns. I attended classes taught by evil nuns. Jodie Foster is no evil nun.)The various subplots and student subgroups were mishandled or missing completely. The book showed the main characters interacting with other students and contained a potent racial subplot relevant to the time period. The movie left every character flat and unconvincing. Even a surprising revelation by a main character and the dramatic conclusion were played simply for shallow shock value.Overall, it was a disappointing film. And my negative appraisal is not simply because the book was better (as is often the case). A good friend who also attended Catholic school saw the movie and found it to be untrue to its setting and even exploitive. It's just not very good on its own merits.

Even if it's full of flaws.  I smiled a lot during the early moments of THE DANGEROUS LIFE OF ALTER BOYS.  I reminisced about by own childhood.  I felt deep sympathy when the characters wanted to cry.  Oh yeah and Jenna Malone has proved she can play more layered roles.  This is a great movie.Set in small town America; in a time before video game saturation and before the Internet was a gleam in Al Gore's mind.  Boys and girls did what they could to elevate boredom. They played outside.  Emile Hirsch (The Emperor's Club) plays Francis Doyle, an alter boy with that typical teenage angst.  Kieran Culkin (Igby Goes Down) plays his best friend Tim Sullivan, he's the brain in the friendship, at least he's the guy who comes up with all the crazy schemes.  There are two other friends Wade (Jake Richardson, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and Joey (Tyler Long, Forrest Gump).  Together these 4 boys create a comic book world into which they can escape.Jenna Malone (Stepmon) plays Margie Flynn, the innocent girl with the dark secret.  Francis longs to date her, and she's going to let him.  Let the coming of age movie begin.Francis and his friends have one problem Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster, Panic Room).  She's their teacher and probably the meanest nun to ever be on film.  She cuts them no slack, humiliates them during class prayer.  She's the perfect villain, for small town kids with out many real problems.THE DANGEROUS LIFE OF ALTER BOYS strikes the right cords at the right moment.  This film hits me like THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, it's not the same story, but Francis is just as strong a central character.  I have a feeling that the real Sister Assupmta, isn't half as mean as Francis think she is.Kieran Culkin's performance hits the right tones too.  He's the mischief-maker and the ringleader, and you know why?  He's charismatic and funny at the right moments.  If I was that age I would have thought the cougar idea was a good one too.  Would I have followed them to the cage? Hmm&#133;I don't know!Jenna Malone, one word--WOW!  The camera loves her, and her performance is so sweet.  I think I hung out with girls just like Margie when I was in high school.  She steals small moments in this film, and you just want to give her a big hug near the end. Did I mention the animation?  The film has some of the most inventive comic book style animation I've ever seen.  It's a nice device to move the story forward; any lesser movie would probably wallow in trashy voice-over.  Thankfully this film does not. If you're looking for a film, that's sweet but not sweet enough to give you a cavity.  If you're looking for a film with just the right beats, even with some faults.  THE DANGEROUS LIFE OF ALTERBOYS just might be your penance. "},{"Title":"'Well, it's the altar boys.

It also is not a movie for youngsters. This time critic Ebert missed the gist of it, in my opinion, and critic Berardinelli has a much more meaningful review. The title is linked to the four boys' behaviors, and after an afternoon of drinking alcoholic drinks, while three of them are eating anchovies to hide the smell, the fourth heads home. One of the others says, 'Going to live dangerously?' There are other examples of their choosing dangerous choices, including the tragic one at the end with the second cougar.The altar boy content sets up the contrast between what parents and clergy think the boys are doing, and what they really are doing. Although I was not an altar boy when I grew up in the 50s, I had enough schooling by Sisters and Fathers that I almost feel like I was one. Although their pranks went a bit far, the misbehavior, salty language, and obsession with drawing cartoons is very realistic. It could have been me and my three friends. The Culkin kid plays a character here that is very hard to like, and that fits him very well. Also fitting is Jenna Malone as the sexually confused teenager. I like Vince D'Onofrio in everything, he is superb here as the priest. Jody Foster is always OK, and she is just OK here.I like the movie very much, and I thought the end was very appropriate. Too many movies make everything come out rosy in the end. This one left many unresolved issues, it is obvious that the boys and girls still had much more growing up, and perhaps incidents like the ones portrayed here are part of that process. Although not remarkable, the DVD is good and the Dolby 5.1 sound adds to the effect. It is in 169 widescreen format which perfectly fits our widescreen TVs.

The title of this movie based on an autobiographical novel set in the 'Seventies turns out to be truer than one would ever have imagined. There is this contrast between the innocence of 'Seventies Catholic school students and the heavy stuff that happens to them.  But these disasters all take place outside the church and parochial school that loom over the young boys and girls glimpsed in `Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys.'Somehow I'd gotten the na√Øve impression that this movie would be lighthearted fun.  Instead, I left somewhat shaken and rather disconcerted because some pretty serious emotions were aroused - without being fully dealt with. Young Francis' life - not unusual for an adolescent boy - is pretty much a non-stop downer even when he gets the girl of his dreams. There are few payoffs and few laughs and the ending is tragic.The movie nonetheless has its own discreet charms.  The dialogue is impressively real from the very first.  These kids don't talk like adults or like hip John Hughes cuties; they talk like what they're supposed to be fourteen-year-olds. When the four boys get together to plan a comic strip or a prank, magic doesn't necessarily happen.  I liked the fact that the filmmakers were willing to let events be as anticlimactic as real boys' lives usually are. And the whole conception of a band of young troublemakers in eighth grade and their outrageous projects to get revenge against a nun who has seized their self-created comic book is a delightful one.On the other hand, the story doesn't exactly show kids just confronting everyday kid stuff. When young Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) gets close to his girlfriend, she reveals an ugly secret far more extreme than anything most kids would ever have to deal with, and what happens to Francis' best friend is a romantic-tragic fantasy of still greater extremes, something that really requires a whole other movie, not just a quick finale. In neither case does the film thoroughly process the issues it has raised.  I wanted to go back and reread S.E. Hinton to see kids' serious problems confronted and dealt with in a mature but youth-friendly way.  Perhaps because of the Catholic milieu, events are framed in overly lurid colors. True, these are nicely absorbed into the imaginary Todd McFarlane animations that grow out of the boys' project to conceive a trinity of supermen based on themselves.  This animated element is an original touch, one that, in theory anyway, parallels the overactive imaginations and busy hormones of young boys - but it's an idea that's not worked out in complete enough detail. I was intrigued by the way the good and evil figures of the animations somehow also fit into the references to William Blake and his `Marriage of Heaven and Hell' - there's some thoughtful writing lying behind the screenplay - but ultimately the animations neither develop completely enough on their own nor parallel the actual events closely enough to provide commentary. Interesting though they are, they seem a bit tacked on, and in fact they were added late in the making of the movie.  We're talking about serious structural flaws, here.On the other hand, Emile Hirsch and Jena Malone, as the principal boy and his girlfriend, both give fine quiet performances without a wrong note. Their lovemaking scenes are sweet and touching and surprisingly intimate for fourteen-year-olds (what would the Legion of Decency say?). Kieran Culkin has presence and intensity as Francis' best friend Tim.  The other boys are not as well differentiated as the minor characters are in `Stand by Me' or `L.I.E.' or `The Virgin Suicides,' though, and while Vincent d'Onofrio and Jodie Foster are smooth and competent, they add nothing remarkable to the movie.  Foster (Sister Assumpta) in particular is disappointing, providing a kind of one-note intensity and no subtlety at all.  It's true that she has wooden material to deal with, playing a classic repressive nun with little to do but snap at the boys and punish them; somehow the screenplay doesn't give her enough real substance.  Nevertheless, there is a whole world of menace and kinkiness behind even the most generic idea of a repressive nun that Foster could have tapped but didn't. Her performance is pushed. D'Onofrio is a pleasant kind of foil, the easy-going, unpretentious priest - but this is surprisingly uninteresting work from an actor of of D'Onofrio's originality and talent.  Why, by the way, are there just one priest and one nun?  And why do we learn almost nothing about Francis and Tim's families? First time director Britisher Peter Care deserves credit for nowhere giving away his music video background, and seeing the movie has made me want to read the late Chris Fuhrman's book.

The highlight of the movie is the outstanding performances delivered by youngsters Emile Hirsch, Kieran Culkin and Jena Malone, whom you might remember as the young Jodie Foster in `Contact.'  In fact, Foster herself appears in this film (in addition to co-producing it) as the uptight nun, Sister Assumpta.  Unfortunately, her character is probably the least well developed one in the film, a fact that seems more obvious than it otherwise might if an actress of Foster's caliber were not playing the part.The film also displays a nice feeling for its early-70's setting and does a good job capturing the way young people actually speak and communicate (the cast members have their nonverbal expressions and gestures down beautifully as well).  Working from the novel by Chris Fuhrman, screenwriters Jeff Stockwell and Michael Petroni, along with director Peter Care, interrupt the live action at regular intervals to provide animated sequences that are ostensibly derived from the anarchic superhero comic book on which the gifted boys are collaborating.  We know that these sequences are intended to provide a kind of fantasy alternate universe for these troubled kids who seem to find no meaning in the restricted world of religion and rules in which they find themselves, but the fact is that these sections of the film, not very creative in themselves, merely serve to thrust us out of the story at crucial moments.`The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' is an odd and somewhat misleading title for this film, since most of the `danger' these boys face is, primarily, a product of their own stupidity and not of their religious upbringing.  Indeed, the religious figures in the film are mainly cranky and/or ineffectual, not really dangerous.  `The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' is an uneven film, but the superb performances by its youthful cast members make it ultimately worth seeing.

Despite veering wildly away from the novel, the film does a great job of transposing moments of boredom-inspired adolescent lunacy with aching transcendence (the scene in which Francis, the protagonist, akwardly talks to his dream girl Margie for the first time made MY heart flutter, and I haven't been 14 for a while!)Still, I wished that the scriptwriters had stuck closer to the book in some respects, especially detailing Francis' home life, which would have given greater insight into WHY he uses his drawing as an escape(and he has a heavy-duty reason to escape). For the guy who wondered in his review about Tim and Francis' home lives, let's just say that Francis' parents are WAY more disfunctional in the book than in the movie. Even with the parents' virtual absence from the movie, there are still great moments that were more or less transferred from book to screen the scene in Margie's bedroom(although a bit more explicit in the book);Tim and Francis' finding the dying dog by the highway and Tim's subsequent soliloquy; the fateful journey into the wildlife preserve. Painful, beautiful, and true. See this one.

Thus, it contains a bit of summary, but nothing that overtly gives any specific plot instances away.*2002's The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys endures as one of the greatest and most under- appreciated dramas of all time. The movie is heavily based on the novel of the same title by Chris Fuhrman; it was Fuhrman's only novel before he tragically passed away from cancer at age 31. The film adaptation, set in a 1970s American town, features three of the industry's most gifted young actors Emile Hirsh, Kieran Culkin and Jena Malone. Hirsh and Culkin star as Francis Doyle and Tim Sullivan, close friends who journey through their maladjusted teen years as students of a strict Catholic nun, played by Jodie Foster. As the boys work on their adventurous and obscene comic book, the film incorporates unique cinematography by bringing the animated scenes to life alongside the basic storyline. Francis' and Tim's adventures demonstrate the teenage mind's ability to arrive at surprisingly deep philosophical conclusions about life's meaning and morality. The film masterfully develops these characters and shows them dealing with complicated and weighty issues such as perverseness in domestic relationships and premature death. Culkin's funny, heartfelt and insightful portrayal of Tim single-handedly tears down the societal parallel between supposed moral maturity and existential knowledge. The misbehaviors of the teens become entirely understandable and relatable to the honest viewer, for the carefully-crafted characters truly embody essence of humanity. The ability of The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys to appeal to the literary mind &#x97; the film offers odes to the works of William Blake &#x97; while incorporating vigorously entertaining animations which allow hope to endure amidst tragedy marks the drama as unique and undoubtedly worthwhile to those who appreciate good art.

So when I recently saw Peter Care's `Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys,' I knew I had found the one film that understood the Catholic altar boy experience completely, from heaven (often visions of girls) to hell (often thoughts of what we would do to those girls).  Along the way we would devise plans to make life as hard for Sister Alexia as possible.In `Altar Boys' Jody Foster plays the wicked, peg-legged Sister Assumpta. Kieran Culkin leads the altar boys in a dangerous series of pranks, sometimes blurring the lines between comedy and tragedy. But checking out the girls while holding the plate for the priest during communion was just one of the many rituals we all vigorously adhered to with the requisite punishments.In sixth grade we trashed the wicked Sister's classroom.  We were caught and punished, and I also received the good citizenship award that year. How could that happen? I was the cutest damned altar boy you ever saw and my father was a generous physician. Similarly in the film the boys steal a statue, trash a classroom, and attempt to liberate a dangerous animal from the zoo.  Regardless of the eras, we all were headed toward sin and redemption as altar boys.Besides the wickedly accurate feel for schoolboy anxiety and exaltation, `Altar Boys' intersperses comic-book hero segments from `The Atomic Trinity' that the boys are creating on the side (Sister Assumpta is their`Nunzilla'). The animations are perfectly matched to the lives of the boys and occur with exquisite timing. The altar boys here have an unusual affinity for making comic books and appreciating William Blake, the comics and poet evoking the stark worlds of innocence and experience, heaven and hell.The adolescent love story involving Jena Malone and Emil Hirsch is tender and foreboding of the dangerous lives awaiting the altar boys. Her secret is difficult for Hirsch and audience to accept, but it does reflect the Catholic penchant for damning most sexually-related sins.Although this film is far from the current controversy about sexual abuse, in some ways it is the same abuse of power draws the Almighty's wrath sooner or later.In third grade a nun called me a dirty thing for holding a little girl's hand. I wish she had seen `Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' because then she would have seen me for the good citizen I was. This is one of the best films of the year and my personal favorite for renewing my conflicted affair with Catholicism.

We watch the boyhood black-and-white vision of Frances Doyle, played with surprising depth by the very talented young artist Emile Hirsch, transform gradually to shades of grey as he closes the door on one phase of life to enter another, not even turning to glance over his shoulder. Kieran Culkin, too, turns in a simultaneously beautiful and tragic performance as Frances's best friend, Tim Sullivan. Somewhat brash and completely unapologetic, Altar Boys delves the minds of 14-year-old boys in all their hormonal and conflicted glory; from the imaginary alter-lives they lead in the collusive effort of creating comic book heroes to Frances's first love testing the bounds of their friendship in ways both startling and completely expected, to an riotously-14-year-old-inspired plot to kill the nun they so detest - played with great reserve, yet to great effect by Jodie Foster - by loosing a cougar into her office, it's no-holds-barred and (at least I expect) dead-to-rights in depicting the indefatigability of boys' imagination and penchant for mischief.I am all about the characters and these were interesting and charming and exasperating; silly and rotten and exhilarating. Like Stand By Me, the characters were richly drawn, well-layered and both primary players had very impressive depth for playing these roles as full-fledged people and not merely...well, not merely '14-year-old boys'. Unlike Stand By Me, these characters were fleshier -- if for no other reason than because of the added two years' life experience. Hirsch's portrayal of Frances's battle within himself, in dealing with a very sensitive secret told him by first love Margie Flynn (Jena Malone does a great job) was realistic and truly conflicted -- not at all cut-and-dried -- and did a fine service to young men everywhere...even if her secret turned out to be a manipulative betrayal, of sorts. Culkin's Tim possessed a worldliness reflective of his love for William Blake and Edgar Allan Poe as much in his critique of cartoon hero KickAss kicking the s*** (literally -- the s***) out of Vincent D'Onofrio's Father Casey as in his tearful (but not over-wrought) roadside warning to Frances of , Don't you ever tell me to 'Get real' again, okay? Because I know real. I kept catching myself thinking how the character Tim possessed the mystical combination of intelligence, wit, passion, and Devil-may-care bravado that drove me wild as a pre-teen girl, so while it was a unique juxtaposition that the slightly more uninspired Frances 'got the girl', it wasn't implausible, but rather added a bit more depth of curiosity to this unique and very interesting film. The very slightest hint of a reverse Cyrano early-on really was charming.If for no other reason than the performances, this film is worth checking out. I could see where in less-talented hands, the script and perhaps even the direction could've fallen flat, but the screen talent carried this one really, really well. Someone once said that they could be enthralled, watching D'Onofrio read the phone book. I concur completely, and this film was no exception to the greater amount of work I've seen of his small parts, huge impressions. Jodie Foster is...well, she's Jodie Foster if I need to say more, you haven't seen enough of her films. But these young actors are ones to watch for, I believe.

I loved the idea, the approach, the story. Unfortunatly, I hated this movie.TDLOAB wanted so much to be a drama. Hacky doesn't even begin to describe it. The screenwriter(s) seemed to be going down a checklist of 'what makes a drama'.Incest, family troubles, neglectful parents, sex, drinking, best friends separated by the inevitable first girlfriend, overbearing nuns, big catholic families, etc etc.Apparently someone getting eaten by a lion is on that checklist too... An idea so unbelievable I laughed at the funeral scene, unfortunate since it was so well done.The movie included a million annoying tidbits, most dropped but never fully paid off IMO Blake could have really been used even more, there should have only been two friends, the entire incest subplot could have been taken out, etc, etc.Foster and D'onofrio I love regardless... and this movie didn't change my opinion of them at all. These two are the type of people I love to watch on screen as an audience member you just have to sit back and say, Wow, that guy is acting! Whew Look at 'em go! To say they're great actors is to state the obvious, so I am... stating the obvious, I mean.(Particularly stand-outish was D'onfrio smoking in his office and shaking an eight-ball. The way he portrayed the priest was so amazing I found myself wishing the screenwriter had added 'getting molested by a catholic priest' to the drama list, just to get some more of that D'onofrio charm. Foster was great as always, but her Irish accent seemed spotty (maybe a character choice? i dunno). She really made a whole character out of relatively few scenes, again making me wish she was featured more prominatly in the movie... but hey, she's Jodie Foster. Amazingness is par for the course).In the final analysis, I think TDLOAB was a great idea with great actors and great motivations. But the message/theme/moral/what the hell the movie was actually about got lost in the subtext. I was left with an unsatisfied feeling and the hope that if Jodie Foster and Vincent D'onofrio agreed to do this movie in the first place, then it must have been amazing somewhere along the line.
