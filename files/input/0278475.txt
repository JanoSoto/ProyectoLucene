[{"Title":"A Creepy Fun Trip Through a Haunted Castle in 3-D!!","Date":"20 July 2001","Score":"9 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Short, Horror","Review":" This film is nothing short of astounding. The first thing you have to do when you go to see it is shut your mind off. Some viewers have complained that the plot is very thin.....no kidding! This is not The Godfather...its HAUNTED CASTLE for pete's sake! This movie reminded me of going through a ride-through haunted house at an amusement park except that the visuals were stunning and the ride was 40 minutes long. If you enjoy animated films but find yourself being annoyed by the wide-eyed Disney-esque characters and the 90 minute running time (that should have and could have been only 60 or less) then this is the film for you. Colorful?....yes. Ingenious?....for sure. Tacky songs sung by talking lobsters.....no! (There are two fantastic trancy/Gothic songs in this film though). I have seen many IMAX films and this to me was the most enjoyable. Some of the scenes were actually genuinely creepy too (like the ones that looked like they were in a closed down church). If you get the chance to see this film in an IMAX theater - grab it!!

That's why Imax wasinvented! This film is especially favorable, seeing as how it's in 3-D.The story is about Johnny, the son of a former rock star mother who leftwhen he was only 3 years old and totally kept out-of-touch with himuntil she died. Upon her death, Johnny recieved a letter from her lawyerstating that he had inherited her castle and that he needed to be thereimmediately - that's where the film starts. Johnny's limo pulls up tothe castle and upon his entry, Johnny discovers it's all an evil trapset up by the devil himself to get Johnny to sign a contract to be afamous rock star like his mother. What ensues is a journey through thetortured lives of those who tried to renig on their contracts. The filmnot very graphic, but can be engrossing. There's lots of skeletons,creepy little green cherubs, weird singing monkey robots and Mephisto,Mr. D's right-hand-man. So the plot is kind of corny, but this film isstill worth seeing - it's like a better version of Disneyland's HauntedMansion, except with somewhat of a plot! The music is EXCELLENT! Belgian band Arid's lead singer, Jasper Steverlinck, plays Johnny and KyokoBaerston of Lunascape (also Belgian) does an excellent job portrayingJohnny's mother (and she Goth-dances too!). At the end of it all we'retreated to a live performance of Arid's Little Things of Venom, anexcellent song which permeats throughout the Haunted Castle. Check itout!!! 10 out of 10..

That movie was amazing, as the 3D is really good and makes you feel like you are right THERE.This movie's 3D also made me feel like I was right there, but unfortunately this was a place where I did not want to be.  The scenery was dismal and ugly, the plot made little sense, the dialogue was awful...  I would give more details about how bad it was but I can't bear to go back and think about it again.  I would have walked out but I was trapped by this handrail that they lower in the IMAX theatre.  Maybe that's why it's there...There were some cool 3D effects;  there was a neat rollercoaster ride (through hell though) , and my favorite effect was one where there were two parallel worlds connected by a window that you could look through.  Unfortunately, what I saw when I looked through was neither scary nor entertaining, just revolting.A bad movie in 3D is still a bad movie.  I highly recommend 3D IMAX if you haven't seen it before --- just not this one.

The visual aesthetics of current 3D projection technology were also a strong drawing point.First, the up side. Much of the film is computer-generated, usually quite obviously so, but this detracts very little from the beauty of the images on the screen. By way of introduction, the film begins with the viewer flying over a vast expanse of seascape and hillside, circling an ominous castle...getting ever closer and closer. This echo of early Imax films (i.e. North of Superior) is highly effective as a means to draw the viewer into the world subsequently created. The illusion of depth and solidity is maintained, and increased, throughout this rather short offering by clever viewpoints, slow panning and circling, and the creation of interior spaces and movements that had some of the audience gasping in discomfort, yet loving the ride. Textures were sumptuous, perspectives both nightmarish and realistic, though the meshing of computer-generated surroundings and human actor(s) was somewhat disconnected or abstract at points. The 3D effect was never lost, though oft-times had a cartoonish quality to it. The music was geared to a 15-25 year-old audience, with some of it having an unearthly beauty that sent shivers along my spine.The disturbing images are inadvertently humourous, lacking even the horror punch present in everyday hellfire-and-brimstone preaching, letalone the creepy-crawly quality present in Nightmare Before Christmas.The down side? The plot isn't much, characters lack depth, and trite philosophy underlies much of the dialogue on the screen. The technology is barely tolerable, with rather heavy eyegear needed to complete the illusions of visual depth. Watching three hours with this equipment on one's head would be physically painful, if not impossible. Though I soon adapted to the equipment I had to move my head, rather than my eyes, to look at different sections of the screen, in order to avoid a disconcerting strobing effect. This is hardly ergonomic.All in all, worth seeing as an almost-spectacular demonstration of a technology in its primitive stages of development, and a visual genre still in formation. More will come our way, and further refinements will no doubt amaze us in years to come.

The 3D technology has come a long way since the red and blue glasses days. The home DVD is worth the price just for the song that the ghost mother sings at the beginning of the movie (even if you don't order the 3D hardware). It's very captivating. The roller coaster ride through hell is awesome with the 3D effect. Some parts are genuinely creepy, particularly the torture room scene where several CGI characters are subjected to some very imaginative painful deaths. Probably not something you would want to explain to younger children. The credits at the end show up as floating bubbles. The credits are as impressive with the 3D effect as the whole rest of the movie. I really enjoyed this short film.

It had just a few things I like about a movie; rock music, gothic, very hot guy, lots of horror. It was a fun roller coaster ride through a bone chilling gothic castle. I'm glad there was a plot line, as thin and flimsy as it was. It was still a potentially  strong plot line, and I think if they had focused a bit more on strengthening the plot, and perhaps made it a longer movie, it would have been excellent. But after all, it was an Imax movie, so you can't expect box office masterpieces jumping out from those screens. Nonetheless, it was VERY enjoyable, and I intend to buy the DVD and if I can, the soundtrack. I LOVE that song he sings at the beginning and end.

I'm pretty sure that the IMAX movies are mainly about their ability to be aesthetically pleasing and interesting on a 6 story screen and not so much about their Oscar award winning potential.

I'm telling everyone I know to see this film. It has artistically inspired me and I left the theater feeling totally invigorated.Coolness!!

If they did, people would be too busy focusing on the story than the 3D effects.In general, this is one the best IMAX 3D movies I've seen mainly for their 3D effects.

I was able to attend a staff preview and I wasn't the only one who was of the opinion that this movie is possibly the worst IMAX ever. I personally put it up there with Solar Max on my list of bad movies. Second, since the movie came out it 2001, there have been so many advancements in 3D animation, perhaps that is why I wasn't impressed with visuals which were fuzzy at times because our IMAX isn't a 3D theater. Maybe IMAX will try again when they can spend a little more money on cleaning up the film so that it doesn't have a jittery effect. Oh and maybe they could spend some time on story and suspense when they do a thriller.Lastly I don't recommend the film to venues that cater to audiences with small children- Unless you are running it at a time that draws more adults and teens. Anyone running this film should have staff that are prepared to answer the question What is the film about? and would it scare my child?.

So I popped in the DVD and put on my glasses. VIOLA! I was truly impressed by the atmosphere and the space the director used. I also got to see two other movies created by the same guy. They all have fun eye-popping effects! STORY Johnny, a musician, is called to his (late) mother's castle to take over her estate. But, it turns out Mr. D is going to offer Johnny immortality, but his soul belongs to Mr. D or something. Johnny then for about thirty minutes walks around the castle and dawns on some pretty gruesome stuff! Eventually Johnny does not take the offer. He then sings opera music, which JUST so happens to be Mr. D's weakness. Then the castle explodes and Johnny lives happily ever after. 3-D Just about every minute you will have something jammed into your face. From violins, guitars, ghosts, and much, much more! FINAL THOUGHTS I think this movie is one of a kind! Especially since it is told through Johnny's eyes which gives you more of a surreal effect. I also cannot understand why Ben Stassen (director) is always strung up with someone going on some kind of a roller coaster! His past movies have someone going on some typed of ride. For example in Encounter of the Third Dimension the robot thing went on some virtual ride. Then in Alien Adventure the whole thing was about aliens going on rollercoasters!!! It does look cool, but he does NOT have to incorporate it in every one of his productions! I hope his new film Fly Me to the Moon does not have the friggin flys going on some roller coaster. But, anyway this movie will keep you entertained for forty minutes and is fun for the whole family.

This film is a visual marvel.  Far and away surpassing anything hollywood has put out.  I realize the IMAX format helps here, and the 40 minute running time allows for more emphasis on such things, but this is the best 3-D film ever made.  You literally feel as if you're at the scene, unlike the cheesy 3-D films of the past.  If you're claustrophobic or prone to motion sickness, this film will not be for you as you feel very closed in and are taken (literally) on an express train ride to the depths of hell.Now for the story...there is none. SPOILER ALERT!  I was sickened when I realized I'd just spent $8.50 and 40 minutes watching nothing more than a promotional music video for the band featured at the end.  Very sad usage for such a marvelous production.  The basic storyline you're asked to follow amounts to this estranged rock star mom dies, leaves rock star son creepy old mansion.  Son visits mansion, realizes mom made deal with the devil for fame, devil tries to recruit son.  Sounds like someone really loves the old blues mythology of Robert Johnson's deal with the devil at the crossroads.Without a doubt, Haunted Castle is worthy of a viewing for nothing more than it's visual ferocity.

Not that long ago, but long enough where 3-D movies were still an attraction, and were around to go to on special occasions or once in a while. Now that they're everywhere and every movie is in 3-D, movies like this one would most likely not be funded because there are big budget 3-D films out there that could make a fortune, and people will definitely go to see them instead of this. And really, this isn't even a very good movie, but, the 3-D is the best I've ever seen, and far superb to 3-D films I've seen even recently. The story isn't great, and the plot is pretty muddled, but this film is a vessel to show off amazing 3-D effects, and as a 3-D vessel, this is pretty darn impressive.The story follows a young man named Johnny, whose father just passed away. Johnny goes to a castle his dad left him and meets Mr. D (voiced by Harry Shearer of the Simpsons), who is actually the Devil. Johnny wants to be a rock and roll star, like his father was, so naturally Satan wants him to sell his soul. Following the basic plot is a string of special effect scenes, which make up 80% of the movie.This movie, as a film, probably deserves about a 3/10. I would never watch this on home video, unless the new 3-D TV's did this thing justice to make it as amazing as it was in Imax. As a 3-D movie, I'd give it a 10. Where movie's currently are being put in 3-D just to make more money, this movie was clearly built for 3-D. And it's really good 3-D. Parts of the movie are right in front of your face, and I don't just mean things pop out, I mean the entire film looks like it's happening right in front of your face. This 3-D is so good, that it makes up somewhat for the stupid characters, and the dumb plot, and the idiotic ending. Where I would normally dislike a movie with a bad plot and good effects, I actually didn't dislike this. It's a very engulfing experience, and the 3-D helps make this very watchable.My rating ** 1/2 out of ****. Not rated, contains some mild language and violence. 40 mins.

(Most vivid in my mind is the opera singer who is strung to a rack and slowly lowered into a vat of acid and barracuda.) The film's 3D effects are mind boggling but often misplaced if not neglected, and there are at least two scenes that play like over-produced music videos.
